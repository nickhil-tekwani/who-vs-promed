A meningococcal disease outbreak in Florida, US, has killed a quarter of people infected this year, according to a health official. Twelve people died among 48 cases of meningococcal disease reported in Florida in 2022, Dr Ulyee Choe, director of the Florida Department of Health (FDH) in Pinellas County, told Insider.

Meningococcal disease is caused by bacteria called _Neisseria meningitidis_, which can infect the lining of the brain and spinal cord, or cause a bloodstream infection.

Choe said the meningococcal disease outbreak is more concerning to him than monkeypox, which has spread quickly in the US in recent months, the Miami Herald reported [https://www.miamiherald.com/news/health-care/article263686733.html].

The commonest symptoms of meningococcal disease are high fever, headache, and a stiff neck, but the illness can also cause a characteristic dark purple rash, vomiting, sensitivity to light, and confusion. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Choe, per the Miami Herald, have urged anyone who is exposed to meningococcal disease or gets symptoms to seek immediate medical attention, because the disease can be treated with antibiotics.

People catch meningococcal disease from prolonged close contact with an infected person, such as when sharing drinks or kissing. According to the FDH, it is not as contagious as the common cold or flu, and the bacteria don't spread during casual contact or from breathing the air where an infected person has been.

It is rare for people in the US to get sick from this bug, in part because meningococcal vaccines protect against 4 of the 5 commonest types of _Neisseria meningitidis_ and are part of the routine vaccine schedule for US teens.

Choe said on Wednesday [20 Jul 2022] that in Florida, meningococcal disease was primarily affecting gay men, but it wasn't "confined to one particular community," per the Miami Herald. "Anyone is susceptible," he said.

The situation comes amid an outbreak of monkeypox that is primarily affecting gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men but, as Insider's Hilary Brueck previously reported, it isn't a "gay disease".

Choe said meningococcal disease concerns him more "to some degree" and is deadlier than monkeypox, which hasn't killed anyone in the US.

CDC said on 22 Jun [2022], when there were 24 cases and 6 deaths, that the meningococcal outbreak in Florida was "one of the worst outbreaks of meningococcal disease among gay and bisexual men in US history". Choe urged men who have sex with men and people who are immunocompromised to get a vaccine, which is freely available in the state, the Miami Herald reported.

Dr Jos√© R. Romero, director at the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in a statement in June [2022]: "Getting vaccinated against meningococcal disease is the best way to prevent this serious illness, which can quickly become deadly."

Twelve people have died among the 48 cases of meningococcal disease confirmed in Florida in 2022, said Dr Ulyee Choe, statewide medical director for the Florida Department of Health at a Wednesday [20 Jul 2022] news briefing. No monkeypox deaths have been reported in the US. "Meningococcal disease, to some degree, concerns me more given the severity of the disease," Choe said.

Four meningococcal disease cases have been reported in Miami-Dade [County] and 2 in Broward [County] this year [2022], Choe said. About half of the cases in Florida are among Hispanic men and people living with HIV, according to CDC. Most cases have been locally transmitted, although some have involved people who have traveled to the state.

Meningitis can be easily transmitted and more likely to kill -- and kill quickly, said Stephen Fallon, executive director of Latinos Salud. A person can go from infected to dead in 2 days. "The newness of the monkeypox outbreak has displaced what is a more urgent focus on the meningitis epidemic in South Florida," he said. The clinic has alerted patients who call for monkeypox vaccine appointments about the risk of meningococcal disease, Fallon said.

Despite the shortage in monkeypox vaccines, Latinos Salud has enough meningococcal disease, COVID-19, and hepatitis A and B vaccines for several weeks. High-risk patients, including men who have sex with men and the immunocompromised, should immediately sign up to get a vaccine, said Jeremy Redfern, press secretary of the Florida Department of Health. "We need to make sure that the public understands . . . that meningococcal disease is a serious threat out of these 2," he said.

[Since 2001, clusters of invasive meningococcal disease (meningitis and bloodstream infection, that is, meningococcemia) among men who have sex with men (MSM) have been reported in cities in North America, Europe, and Australia, associated with a high case fatality rate. All cases were caused by hypervirulent serogroup C strains of _Neisseria meningitidis_ (MenC) belonging to the sequence type (ST) 11 (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0160126).

The outbreaks of invasive meningococcal disease have occurred in Toronto (2001), Chicago (2003), New York (2010-13), Paris (2014), Berlin (2012-13), Southern California (2012-16), and Victoria, Australia (2017). Currently, there is a large ongoing MenC outbreak among MSM in Florida. This outbreak in Florida is mostly affecting people who live in Florida, but also involves non-residents who have traveled to Florida (https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/outbreaks/FL2022.html#serogroup-c-outbreak). Increased international travel to attend large gatherings, in crowded venues, in the context of Gay Pride and other festivals may be factors facilitating the spread of the MenC invasive meningococcal disease among MSM, as it has monkeypox. Vaccination campaigns using a conjugate meningococcal C vaccine, such as MenACWY, in MSM with one dose (or a 2-dose series for people with HIV), at least 2 weeks before traveling, have been encouraged by the US CDC and European health authorities (https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/outbreaks/FL2022.html and https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/downloads/17-275138C1-MeningococcalDis-ACWY-Outbreak-FS.pdf).

Although _N. meningitidis_ normally colonize the mucosal surfaces of the nasopharynx, members of the meningococcal ST 11 clade have also genetically adapted to the urogenital tract, facilitating transmission via oro-genital sexual contact to cause outbreaks of meningococcal urethritis presenting at sexually transmitted infection clinics in multiple US cities in recent years (Ohio, California, Michigan, Indiana, Georgia, and other states) (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6521a5.htm and https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-018-4560-x). _N. meningitidis_ isolates from MSM with invasive meningococcal disease in Germany have been found to be genetically similar to _N. meningitidis_ strains from urethritis in MSM, suggesting that sexual transmission may be playing a role in the emergence of MenC disease among MSM (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4972413/).

Gram-stained smears of urethral discharge appear identical in gonococcal and meningococcal urethritis. Meningococcal urethritis in this circumstance should be suspected if the gonococcal NAAT of the urethral discharge is negative (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/rr/rr7004a1.htm). Meningococcal urethritis is treated with the same antimicrobial regimens as gonococcal urethritis.

Although evidence is limited regarding the risk for sexual transmission or recurrent infections with meningococcal urethritis, treatment of sex partners of patients with meningococcal urethritis with the same antimicrobial regimens as for exposure to gonococcal infection can be considered (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/rr/rr7004a1.htm). - Mod.ML
