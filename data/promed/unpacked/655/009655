YELLOW FEVER IN ASIA (12)
=========================
Subject: ProMED Digest v96.n052 (Yellow fever in Asia)
A comment in response to Charlie Calisher's suggestion (or rather,
"just a thought") of immunizing individuals at-risk of dengue
infection with YF vaccine as a means of suppressing viremia and
therefore breaking the human-mosquito-human transmission cycle. It
is worth remembering the early Walter Reed trials of their
attenuated dengue 2 vaccine candidate, the S-1 clone of PR159.
These studies have been regularly referred to by Scott Halstead and
others as further in vivo evidence for antibody-dependent
enhancement of infection, as the YF fever vaccinees in this study
experienced apparent increases in viremia, not the reverse!
Cheers,

[Moderator (C.H. Calisher) -- Okay, so it wasn't much of a thought.
Nonetheless, Dr. Young's input is greatly appreciated and quite
valuable.]
