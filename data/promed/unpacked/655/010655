Please find a report from Hong Kong to the International Breeders Meeting,
International Collating Center, Animal Health Trust, Newmarket, United
Kingdom, which details the facts involved when a horse, which was
seropositive for _Babesia equi_, was inadvertently exported to Australia on
7 Mar 2000. All parties on the report, are anxious the facts of the case
are disseminated, especially since an edited article from the South China
Morning Post newspaper referring to the incident, was posted on 23 Mar 2000.
A total of 232 randomly selected racehorses, hacks and ponies representing
ALL the equine premises in Hong Kong, consisting of 25 training stables and
9 riding schools, have now returned NEGATIVE results for antibodies to_B.
equi_ and _B. caballi_ (agents responsible for piroplasmosis in horses) in
serum samples collected between 14 and 20 March 2000. This represents
14.85% of the equine population of Hong Kong and indicates piroplasmosis is
most probably NOT circulating in the national herd.
Of these 232 samples, which were all tested by CFT (compliment fixation
test) 10 were SUSPICIOUS to _B. equi_ and 2 SUSPICIOUS to _B. caballi_ but
all 12 sera were NEGATIVE by IFAT(indirect florescent antibody test). ALL
serum samples collected between 14 and 20 March from Hong Kong's total
equine population of 1562, will, within the next month, be tested by IFAT.
