For the first time, however, new research is linking chytrid fungus --
which has been implicated as a probable cause of major amphibian die-offs
in pristine areas around the globe -- as a factor in the declines of some
of the state's frog populations, according to recent studies by researchers
with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
(USFWS), Arizona Game and Fish Department(AGFD), and the University of
Arizona.
These die-offs of amphibians in the Southwest and around the globe are of
great concern because amphibians are good barometers of significant
environmental changes that may go initially undetected by humans. Since the
1970's all 7 native true frog species in Arizona have declined to some
degree -- and some precipitously. Introduction of non-native predators or
competitors -- fishes, bullfrogs and crayfishes -- has been the single most
important factor in recent declines of native frog populations in the
Southwest, said Cecil Schwalbe, a research scientist of the USGS Western
Ecological Research Center in Tucson, Ariz. Previous loss and degradation
of wetland habitat have also affected many populations, but recent studies
implicate chytrid fungus as a player in the declines as well. Researchers
are examining the roles of chytrid fungus disease and air quality, but note
at the same time, viable populations of leopard frogs will need to be
maintained through conservation efforts until the causes of decline are
understood and can be fully addressed.
From 1993 to 1996, researchers from the USGS, the USFWS, AGFD, and the
University of Arizona conducted intense conservation efforts in extreme
southeastern Arizona on San Bernardino National Wildlife Refuge, at Douglas
High School in the nearby town of Douglas, Ariz., and on the Magoffin
Ranch, near the refuge. They introduced leopard frogs to new sites where
bullfrogs -- which are voracious predators on the leopard frogs -- were
absent. Leopard frogs increased in number exponentially, but in 1997, a
rapid, mysterious and alarming die-off of leopard frogs occurred at some of
the sites, Schwalbe said.
Chytrid fungus in amphibians was first identified in 1998 by an
international team of scientists. This team, which included Dr. D. Earl
Green, a USGS wildlife pathologist, discovered the fungus had most likely
been responsible for large amphibian die-offs in pristine areas of Panama
and Australia. It also was a probable cause of recent die-offs in remaining
populations of the endangered boreal toad in the southern Rocky Mountains
this year. "This disease, added to past habitat desiccation and ongoing
non-native species problems, may wreak havoc with a number of frog species,
especially the Chiricahua leopard frog," Rosen said. "Another question is
whether pollution or some other stressor aids the disease's impacts."
Air quality, possibly in conjunction with disease, may have been involved
in the disappearance of the Tarahumara frog from its last known locality in
the United States in 1983, said Schwalbe. All declining populations of this
former Arizona frog were downwind of a copper smelter produced acid rain
and heavy metal deposition in the areas of frog decline. At the same time,
populations of the Chiricahua leopard frog also declined or disappeared at
the same localities, Schwalbe said. The relationship among air and water
quality, disease and declines in frog populations needs further study.
"Episodes of frog die-offs at San Bernardino National Wildlife Refuge
appear correlated with low- pressure meteorological inversions trapping
smelter emissions in the valleys," said Tony Velasco, a USFWS scientist.
While the air quality studies are being conducted, Rosen and Schwalbe are
implementing research and management plans to re-establish leopard frogs in
wetlands at Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge with funding from Arizona
Water Protection Fund and USFWS, and assistance from wildlife refuge staff.
The plans entail eliminating bullfrogs from portions of the refuge and
moving leopard frog eggs, tadpoles or small frogs to new sites in the area,
said Schwalbe. Livestock tanks will be used to re-establish leopard frogs
on the refuge. The techniques from this study will be available to
ranchers, such as those in the Malpai Borderlands Group, who are already
working successfully to preserve amphibians and other wildlife on their lands.
