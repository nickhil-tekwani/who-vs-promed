Pulse crops such as urdbean, mungbean, and soybean in Punjab have
come under attack of whiteflies, an insect pest. The attack has been
witnessed in all the pulse-growing areas of the state, a Punjab
Agricultural University (PAU) press release stated today [26 Aug
2007]. This insect has appeared in epidemic form due to the hot
weather conditions coupled with dry monsoon spell prevailing in the
state over the last few weeks. Such weather conditions are extremely
conducive for the rapid multiplication of the pest.
According to Dr N S Buttar, Head, Department of Entomology, PAU
[Punjab Agricultural University], whitefly feeds on the leaves of the
plants by sucking the cell sap and excretes honey dew on the plants,
on which the growth of sooty mould takes place, resulting in the
blackening of leaves and decreases in the normal photosynthesis. In
case of severe attack, there is total blackening of the crop,
resulting in drying of leaves and ultimately, total crop failure.
Whitefly is also a vector of serious viral disease -- mungbean yellow
mosaic --, which is a limiting factor in the successful cultivation
of these crops.
Dr Buttar has advised the farmers not to get panicky and to spray the
crop with the recommended insecticides.

[_Mungbean yellow mosaic virus_ (MYMV; genus _Begomovirus_, family
_Geminiviridae_) is endemic to South Asia. A number of strains have
been isolated from different hosts and locations (India, Thailand,
Philippines).
_Mungbean yellow mosaic India virus_ (MYMIV) has now been classified
as a distinct species. It is the most serious problem of mungbean in
the Indian subcontinent (India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh) and also
affects other leguminous crops such as soybean, cowpea, pidgeonpea,
and black gram. Infected plants become chlorotic and stunted, and
yield losses of up to 100 percent have been reported in severely
affected crops. MYMIV is transmitted by whiteflies (_Bemisia tabaci_)
in a non-persistent manner, meaning that vector insects remain
infective for a period of time after acquisition of the virus. MYMIV
is not transmitted by mechanical inoculation, seed, or pollen.
Disease management includes vector control (insecticides, weed
control) and the use of resistant host varieties.
Interaction between MYMIV and a satellite DNA has been reported
resulting in even more severe symptoms than infection by the virus
alone. _Begomovirus_-satellite disease complexes have been found to
cause economically important diseases in a range of crops and pose a
serious threat to tropical and sub- tropical agriculture worldwide.
It is not stated in this report whether MYMIV symptoms have already
been observed in the region. Since the virus is rife in northern
India, potential sources of inoculum for the vector insects may be
expected to be available, and dispersal (for example by wind, plant
material, human movement) of insects carrying the virus would be
likely. Once a local source of MYMIV is available, spread throughout
the regional crops will be very fast given the large numbers of
vector insects present.
