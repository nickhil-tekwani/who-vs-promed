PAU warns farmers against diseases in paddy crop
------------------------------------------------
Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) claimed to have found cases of
sheet [sic] blight and leaf blight diseases in paddy crop in the state
and asked farmers to take proper measures to save the crop.

PAU head Department of Plant Pathology, Dr HS Rewal, advised farmers
to spray the crop with a solution of fungicide. He said water should
not be allowed to stand in the fields for long periods as it provides
conditions congenial for disease development.

The varieties Pusa-44 and other non-recommended ones are more prone to
the disease, Rewal said.

[Bacterial leaf blight (BLB) of rice is caused by _Xanthomonas oryzae_
pv. _oryzae_ and has been reported from Asia, northern Australia,
Africa, and the USA. Yield losses of up to 60 percent have been
reported in Asia. Symptoms include yellowing, drying of leaves,
wilting of seedlings, and severe strains may also affect panicles.
Mild strains cause only small leaf lesions and may not lead to any
detectable yield loss. Various saprophytic fungi may invade the
lesions, contributing to the damage. Field patches infested with BLB
have a whitish, ragged appearance. BLB is favoured by rain, high
levels of fertiliser, high humidity, standing pools of water, and warm
temperatures. The bacterium is short-lived in soil and suspected to be
seed-borne, and it is spread mainly by windblown rain and mechanical
means. Grassy weeds, infected plant material such as rice stubble or
ratoons, and contaminated irrigation systems are thought to be the
primary pathogen reservoirs. Disease management includes
phytosanitation, cultural measures, and use of resistant crop varieties.

Sheath blight (called "sheet blight" in the report above) is caused by
the fungus _Thanatephorus cucumeris_ (previously _Rhizoctonia
solani_). Symptoms include expanding lesions on sheaths of leaves near
the water line during the late tillering or early internode elongation
stages. Infection spreads rapidly in the field by runner hyphae or
plant-to-plant contact. Yield losses of up to 50 percent are reported
in highly susceptible cultivars resulting from poorly filled grain
heads and reduced plant vigour. Fungal sclerotia survive for long
periods in the soil and float to the surface of flooded rice fields
causing infection in the next crop. The fungus can also attack a
number of weed hosts, which can serve as pathogen reservoirs. No
reliable source of genetic host resistance has been identified so far.
Disease management includes cultural and phytosanitary techniques and
foliar fungicides.

Of the control measures recommended above, fungicides would only be
effective against the fungal sheath blight, not the bacterial leaf
blight. Avoiding standing water in the paddies is one of the practices
recommended to limit leaf blight but would also assist with sheath
blight control.
