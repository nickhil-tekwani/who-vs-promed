Small risk of bleeding disorder after AstraZeneca COVID vaccine
---------------------------------------------------------------
A study of 5.4 million Scottish adults has revealed a small increased risk of an autoimmune bleeding disorder after the 1st dose of the AstraZeneca/Oxford COVID-19 vaccine, although a causal link hasn't been established.

The study, led by University of Edinburgh researchers and published today [Wed 9 Jun 2021] in Nature Medicine, assessed the risk of bleeding-related events among 2.53 million people (57.5% of the population of Scotland 18 and older) up to 27 days after the 1st dose of the AstraZeneca or Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine from December 2020 to April 2021. [Simpson CR, Shi T, Vasileiou E, et al.: First dose ChAdOx1 and BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccines and thrombocytopenic, thromboembolic and hemorrhagic events in Scotland. Nat Med. 2021; doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-021-01408-4]

Of the 2.53 million, more than 1.7 million received the AstraZeneca vaccine, while about 800 000 received the Pfizer version.

The risk of the autoimmune bleeding disorder, immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), was estimated at 11 per 1 million 1st vaccine doses above the usual background risk in the 1st 2 weeks after vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine. However, most people who developed ITP were unvaccinated, which the researchers said shows that ITP is not solely vaccine related.

"First dose of [AstraZeneca] was found to be associated with small increased risks of ITP, with suggestive evidence of an increased risk of arterial thromboembolic and hemorrhagic events," the authors wrote. "Given these small increased risks for [AstraZeneca], alternative vaccines for individuals at low COVID-19 risk might be warranted when supply allows."

ITP manageable in most cases
-----------------------------
Vaccinees diagnosed as having ITP tended to be older (median age 69 years) and had one or more underlying conditions, such as coronary heart disease, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease.

ITP, which is characterized by low platelet counts, can be asymptomatic or cause mild bruising or excessive bleeding and long-term illness, although it typically is mild and treatable, the researchers said. No ITP-related deaths were reported among vaccine recipients.

The study findings also suggested a very small increased risk of other AstraZeneca-linked arterial blood clot and bleeding events, although the rate was no higher than that of other vaccines such as those against hepatitis B; flu; and measles, mumps, and rubella.

The researchers couldn't draw conclusions about any link between the AstraZeneca vaccine and a rare condition called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), in which a blood clot forms in the brain, because too few vaccinated people developed it. CVST developed in a handful of Johnson & Johnson vaccine recipients in the United States earlier this spring [2021].

While clinical trials have shown that the AstraZeneca and Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines are usually well tolerated, the United Kingdom's Medicine and Healthcare products and Regulatory Agency has received a relatively small number of reports of thrombocytopenia (a bleeding disorder) and thromboembolic cases (abnormal blood clotting) among 22 million 1st doses and 6.8 million 2nd doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, at an estimated rate of 13 per 1 million 1st doses.

As a result, use of the AstraZeneca vaccine in younger people in European countries has been limited or halted.

Benefits outweigh risks
-----------------------
To put the risks into context, study coauthor James McMenamin, MBChB, MPH, of Public Health Scotland, said in a Nature Medicine press conference today [Wed 9 Jun 2021] that the risk of severe COVID-19 or death is far greater than any posed by the AstraZeneca vaccine, especially for older people and other susceptible groups.

"We can see here that even if the AstraZeneca vaccine has a risk of the development of ITP, the benefits really outweigh the risks, and it's important from the public health perspective that we continue to promote that vaccine," he said.

The researchers called for further research involving people younger than 40 years and to evaluate outcomes after 2nd doses of the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines. "We are now planning to update our analysis as the vaccine programme is being extended to younger, healthier individuals and as new vaccines are becoming available," lead author Colin Simpson of the Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand said in a University of Edinburgh press release [https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-06/uoe-cvl060821.php].

Risk factors for COVID infection, death noted in group home residents
---------------------------------------------------------------------
A study of adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) living in New York City group homes has identified older age, larger residential settings, Down syndrome, and chronic kidney disease as risk factors for COVID-19 infection, with heart disease as a risk factor for related death.

Led by a Syracuse University researcher, the study was published yesterday [Tue 8 Jul 2021] in JAMA Network Open. [Landes SD, Turk MA, Damiani MR, Proctor P, Baier S: Risk Factors Associated With COVID-19 Outcomes Among People with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Receiving Residential Services. JAMA Netw Open. 2021; 4(6): e2112862; doi: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.12862; https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2780779.] The team tracked COVID-19 outcomes for 543 residents of homes operated by a single nonprofit organization in all 5 city boroughs from [1 Mar-1 Oct 2020].

Of the 543 residents, 91 (16.8%) were diagnosed as having COVID-19, and 35 (6.4%) died from their infections. Infection risks were increased for older residents (odds ratio [OR], 1.04), those with Down syndrome (OR, 2.91) or chronic kidney disease (OR, 4.17), and those living in a facility with more residents (OR, 1.07). Residents with heart disease were at dramatically higher risk of death from COVID-19 (OR, 10.60).

Among those with IDD, 56 residents (10.3%) also had Down syndrome, while 50 (9.2%) had cerebral palsy. The most common underlying medical conditions were obesity (29.1%), type 2 diabetes (19.0%), and heart disease (17.5%).

Median resident age was 57 years, 40% were women, and 50.5% were Black, Asian/Pacific Islander, American Indian, Alaskan Native, or Hispanic.

"The fact that the case rate, case-fatality rate, and mortality rate were substantially higher for people with IDD living in residential settings than for New York City overall is consistent with results from prior studies documenting increased COVID-19 risk for people with IDD and emphasizes the urgent need to prioritize vaccination allocation for this population," the authors wrote.

In addition, they said, "Results underscore that COVID-19 diagnosis should prompt close monitoring and consideration of hospitalization if respiratory symptoms develop for all people with IDD, but especially for those who are older, have preexisting medical conditions and/or Down syndrome, or live in settings with more residents."

Real-world study finds 2 doses of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine 89% effective
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
An Israeli population-based study found 89% vaccine effectiveness (VE) 7 or more days after the 2nd dose, according to a study today in Open Forum Infectious Diseases [Zacay G, Shasha D, Bareket R, et al.: BNT162b2 vaccine effectiveness in preventing asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus: a nationwide historical cohort study. Open Forum Infectious Diseases. 2021; ofab262; doi: https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofab262].

The researchers followed 6286 people, of whom 30.2% weren't vaccinated, 23% received one dose, and 46.8% received 2 doses (mean ages, 36, 41, and 52 years, respectively). The follow-up period was from [1 Jan-11 Feb 2021], during which the country's new daily infections peaked at more than 8000 cases per day from [14-20 Jan 2021] and then subsided to 5822 by the study's end.

Pre-vaccination infection rate was measured as well as VE 14 days after the 1st dose up to 2nd dose administration, 1-6 days after the 2nd dose, and 7 days or more after the 2nd dose.

The researchers found that, for those unvaccinated, the incidence rate was 53 cases per 10 000 person-days. Therefore, the data showed that VE was 61% (95% confidence interval [CI], 49% to 71%) 14 days or more after one dose, which the researchers note is in alignment with a JAMA Network Open study yesterday [Tue 8 Jun 2021] [see above] that found 51.4% in days 13-24 after the 1st dose. For those who received 2 doses of the vaccine, VE was 82% (95% CI, 71% to 89%) 1-6 days post-vaccination and 89% (95% CI, 82% to 94%) 7 or more days post-vaccination.

The researchers write, "The frequent PCR [polymerase chain reaction] testing in our cohort enabled estimation of infections, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic. The reduction ratio remained constant between the individuals in ultra-orthodox Jewish towns, which had higher incidence of COVID-19 infection, and the other cohort participants. The large cohort with its large age variance suggests that these results may be applicable in different population groups."

The Group of Seven is set to vow to deliver at least 1 billion extra doses of vaccines over the next year to help cover 80% of the world's adult population, a move designed to end the pandemic next year [2022], according to a draft communique seen by Bloomberg News. It will also call for a new study into the origins of the coronavirus.

US President Joe Biden's administration intends to buy 500 million doses of Pfizer Inc.'s vaccine to share internationally through a World Health Organization-backed program to help lower-income nations. Moderna Inc. is also in talks with Biden's team.

More than 80% of the athletes participating in the Tokyo Olympics next month [July 2021] have been vaccinated. In the UK, cases rose the most since February [2021] amid a surge fueled by the delta variant first identified in India. Meanwhile, the European parliament approved vaccine passports, a key step toward easing travel across the European Union.

Key developments:

- Global tracker: Cases exceed 174 million; deaths pass 3.75 million
- Vaccine tracker: About 2.2 billion doses administered
- G-7 plans 1 billion extra COVID shots to end pandemic next year [2022]
- New York tax bills show COVID's lasting damage to real estate
- US to buy 500 million Pfizer shots for low-income nations
- Biden and Johnson vow to speed up opening US-UK travel

South Africa cases indicate 3rd surge:

The number of new confirmed cases in South Africa surged to 8881, with a positivity rate of 16.5% on tests conducted. "The increased number of tests and cases and increased positivity are all evidence of the predicted 3rd surge in COVID-19 cases," the National Institute of Communicable Diseases said in a statement on Wednesday [9 Jun 2021]. The commercial hub of Gauteng accounted for 58% of the new cases. South Africa is the worst-affected nation on the continent, with over 57 000 deaths and 1.7 million confirmed infections.

[4] US: Delta variant

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/06/delta-variant-makes-6-us-covid-19-cases


The Delta variant, a highly contagious COVID-19 variant first identified in India and also known as B1617.2, now accounts for about 6% of US infections, Anthony Fauci, MD, the chief medical adviser to the White House, said yesterday [Tue 8 Jun 2021]. The variant has become the dominant strain not only in India but also the United Kingdom, where younger people are getting sick more frequently.

Fauci said the transmissibility of the Delta variant should prompt any eligible American who has not done so yet to get vaccinated as quickly as possible, as preliminary data show the Pfizer vaccines is 88% effective against the Delta strain.

But despite a nationwide push to vaccinate 70% of American adults with at least one dose of vaccine before the Fourth of July, White House officials are now quietly resigned to not reaching that goal, as daily vaccinations have dropped to under 400 000 shots administered each day.

According to the Associated Press, roughly 15.5 million adults would need to receive at least one dose in the next 4 weeks to get to the 70% goal. Fourteen states have met the goal, and another 12 are likely to by 4 Jul [2021]. But some states, such as Mississippi, would need almost another year to reach the goal if their vaccination pace remains the same.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) COVID Data Tracker shows 372 100 285 COVID-19 vaccine doses have been delivered in the United States, and 303 923 667 have been administered, with 140 441 957 Americans fully vaccinated.

Yesterday [Tue 8 Jun 2021], the nation reported 13 011 new COVID-19 cases and 380 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker. The official total has reached [33 411 878 US cases and 598 773 deaths] [https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html].

[Two doses of the Pfizer vaccination will prevent symptomatic disease following infection with the Delta variant (compared with 93% effectiveness against the Alpha variant, i.e., B.1.1.7), according to a Public Health England study. They further found that "2 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine were 60% effective against symptomatic disease from the B.1.617.2 variant compared to 66% effectiveness against the B.1.1.7 variant. Both vaccines were 33% effective against symptomatic disease from B.1.617.2 3 weeks after the 1st dose compared to around 50% effectiveness against the B.1.1.7 variant" (https://www.gov.uk/government/news/vaccines-highly-effective-against-b-1-617-2-variant-after-2-doses). - Mod.LK]
