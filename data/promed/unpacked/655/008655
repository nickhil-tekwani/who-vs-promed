For the 1st time in state fair history, 3 pigs on exhibit tested positive for a strain of flu known as influenza A H3N2.

The Agriculture Department says the pigs appeared healthy when they arrived at the fair and became ill later. Once it was discovered, the owners removed them.

The Health Department says it is difficult but not impossible for a pig to infect a person. It can happen if a pig coughs near a person, and avoiding infection is done the same way as it is with human to human contact: Wash your hands frequently and avoid those who are sick.

[To quote an earlier commentary by ProMED Mod.CP in archived post 20130627.1795810: A novel reassortant H3N2 influenza virus [(H3N2)v] was identified in the United States last year (2012). The (H3N2)v infections involved a swine-origin H3N2 virus that included the M (matrix) gene from the pandemic 2009 H1N1 (pH1N1) virus. According to Kitikoon and 10 others: Pathogenicity and transmission in pigs of the novel A(H3N2)v influenza virus isolated from humans and characterization of swine H3N2 viruses isolated in 2010-2011, J Virol. 2012 Jun; 86(12): 6804-14. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00197-12, JVI.00197-12; http://jvi.asm.org/content/early/2012/03/29/JVI.00197-12, swine influenza virus (SIV) H3N2 with triple reassorted internal genes (TRIG) has been enzootic in the US since 1998. Transmission of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) virus to pigs in the US was followed by reassortment with endemic SIV, resulting in reassorted viruses that include novel H3N2 genotypes (rH3N2p).

Between July-December 2011, 12 cases of human infections with swine-lineage H3N2 viruses containing the pandemic matrix (pM) gene (A(H3N2)v) were detected (see ProMED-mail archived reports listed below). Whole genome analysis of H3N2 viruses isolated from pigs from 2009-2011 showed 6 different rH3N2p genotypes present in the US swine population since 2009. The presence of the pM gene was a common feature among all rH3N2p genotypes, but no specific genotype appeared to predominate in the swine population. Study of the pathogenic, transmission, genetic, and antigenic properties of a human A(H3N2)v isolate and 3 swine H3N2 isolates, H3N2-TRIG and rH3N2p revealed no increased virulence in A(H3N2)v or rH3N2p viruses compared to endemic H3N2-TRIG virus. These authors concluded that enhanced transmissibility and/or virulence is unlikely to be a property of these H3N2 recombinant viruses. - Mod.MHJ
