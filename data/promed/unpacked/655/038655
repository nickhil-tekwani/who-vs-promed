This is in response to the question regarding the route of exposure for the
New York City (NYC) resident with tularemia. Interviews with the patient
suggest mechanical transmission likely occurred through indirect contact
with infected wild rabbits on Staten Island. The patient's 2 dogs visit a
local park daily. One dog captured a wild rabbit and subsequently licked
the patient on the face upon returning home.
The events occurred approximately 7 to 10 days prior to the onset of
illness, which is consistent with the incubation period for tularemia. The
patient never visited the park or had direct contact with rabbits or
rodents, and denied having any tick or insect bites. The patient suffered
from severe acne and complained of having a swollen submandibular lymph
node a few days prior to her onset of illness.
The patient's 2 dogs had positive antibody titers for tularemia, and
several rabbits collected from the park were positive by direct fluorescent
antibody testing (DFA). All animal testing was graciously done by our
colleagues at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Ft. Collins, CO.
