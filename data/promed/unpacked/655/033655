Illness in military personnel in Bagram, Afghanistan
----------------------------------------------------
Between 13 and 19 May 2002, 29 cases of vomiting, diarrhea, and fever
affected British military staff in Bagram, Afghanistan (ref.1 and
ProMED-mail posts listed below). The illness had a short incubation period
and mainly affected staff in the field hospital. Three patients were
classified as seriously ill, with circulatory collapse (Glasgow coma score
4). Due to the difficult conditions in Bagram, 10 of them were brought back
to the United Kingdom (UK) for medical care in National Health Service
hospitals. Another patient was flown to receive care at an American
military hospital in Germany. All cases have recovered and have been
discharged from hospital. No further cases have been reported from Bagram,
the field hospital has reopened, and infection control procedures have been
enhanced.
There were 3 secondary cases: 2 were medical personnel on the military
aeromedical flight who looked after the first patient who came to the UK.
During the hospital admission of the first patient, a close contact of his
became unwell. Of these cases 2 were admitted to hospital, but all have
recovered and been discharged from hospital. There were 2 other possible
cases of infection in personnel who unloaded the aeroplane used for
repatriation but these have not been confirmed. No other cases were
reported in health care workers or community contacts.
All basic microbiological testing in the Bagram field hospital laboratory
was negative. Tests on specimens from the cases in the UK carried out by
the Public Health Laboratory Service's Central Public Health Laboratory in
London found evidence of Norwalk-like virus (NLV) infection. Three
techniques were used to establish a viral cause for the gastroenteritis.
Examination of the fecal specimens by electron microscopy revealed virus
particles with a morphology characteristic of small round structured
viruses. Tests using an antigen capture enzyme linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) utilising a panel of monoclonal antibodies directed against the
capsid protein of NLV were positive. NLV RNA was detected from 5 patients
by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.
Characterisation of the virus by partial DNA sequencing of a region of the
polymerase gene indicated that the virus was related to genogroup II
viruses detected previously in the environment in the UK. It was concluded
that NLV caused the outbreak.

[This report provides the final verdict on this outbreak and effectively
draws a line under the incident. The genotyping result and the
characteristics of the disease suggest that the virus was carried to
Afghanistan with the military personnel rather than acquired locally. This
thread is now cut. - Mod.CP]
