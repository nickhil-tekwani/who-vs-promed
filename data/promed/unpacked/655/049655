Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: Russian Far East Federal District. Foot and mouth disease virus was detected on a private farm in the village of Usachevka in a remote south east corner of the country. The outbreak affected 7 cows from 240 cattle heads and 22 small ruminants. The source of the outbreak is currently unknown. The village of Usachevka is located at 45 km [28 mi] from the border between Russia and China. Primorsky Krai is part of the buffer zone where cattle and small livestock are vaccinated against foot and mouth disease on an annual basis. All necessary measures to curb the outbreak and prevent the spread of the disease are being taken.
According to nucleotide sequencing followed by phylogenetic analysis, the isolate belongs to type O PanAsia genetic lineage and is genetically close to the isolates involved in the FMD outbreaks in China and Eastern Kazakhstan in 2011.

Control measures
Measures applied: quarantine; screening; disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: vaccination in response to the outbreak (s)

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: All-Russian Research Institute for Animal Health (FGBI-ARRIAH) (national laboratory)

[As can be seen from references at the end of this posting, FMD occurs commonly in China and periodically in the Far Eastern part of Russia. While there is no mention of a specific traceback to China in this outbreak, the location is only 45 kilometers (28 mi) from the Chinese border and it appears the strain is closely related to the one isolated in Russia and Eastern Kazakhstan in 2011.

With all the FMD activity going on in these border reasons, we should not be surprised that the Russian make this area a buffer region where vaccination is practised. - Mod.PC
