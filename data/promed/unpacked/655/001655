My colleagues and I in the Montana Department of Livestock, along
with other officials in both state and federal agencies, are now
engaged in one of the most intensive disease investigations in recent
Montana history.
The tremendous help and cooperation we've been receiving from ranch
families around the state, and from others involved in Montana's
livestock industries, has been critically important and is most
appreciated.
Brucellosis was detected in Montana cattle on 18 May 2007,
threatening our state's brucellosis-free status. While brucellosis
poses only a minute risk to human health, the economic costs could
severely curtail Montana's premiere beef cattle industry. In
addition, under federal rules, once brucellosis is detected, an
exhaustive investigation that confirms no other cases of diseased
livestock must be completed within 60 days for the state to retain
its disease-free status, which was hard won in 1985.
Brucellosis usually causes late-term abortions in cattle, bison and
elk. Rarely will an infected cow carry a calf past 5 to 7 months, but
sometimes a live, but weak calf is born. The bacteria, _Brucella
abortus_, thrives in un-pasteurized milk, afterbirth and other
reproductive tract discharges, including aborted fetuses. The
infection also spreads through reproductive discharges of fluids and
materials.
Research documents the spread of brucellosis from wildlife to
domestic cattle when 2 or more species share rangelands, especially
during the spring birthing season.
_Brucella abortus_ can lead to undulant fever in humans, an incurable
and severely debilitating condition. Once a serious problem (and
still a problem in epidemic proportions around the world), this risk
in the U.S. has been virtually eliminated. It is the reason behind
the nation's eradication effort, which began in the 1930s. Today,
pasteurized milk and properly-cooked meat are risk-free.
Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services statistics
indicate that between 1960 and 1985, when Montana acquired its
brucellosis-free status, there were 28 cases of human undulant fever
diagnosed in Montana. In the past 20 years since becoming Brucellosis
class-free, only 4 Montanans have contracted the disease.
Over the past several weeks, the Montana Department of Livestock and
the Veterinary Services Division of the USDA Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service (USDA:APHIS:VS) worked in close cooperation to
test the Bridger herd, where brucellosis was discovered.
Our state Diagnostic Laboratory in Bozeman has done extraordinary
work, at times generating accurate test results in as short a
turn-around as several hours. To confirm brucellosis, a veterinarian
must draw a blood sample and send it to the Diagnostic Laboratory in
Bozeman. Usually, results are available within a week.
Now we are engaged in an effort to trace all breeding stock that has
come in contact with the Bridger herd through sales, purchases or
commingled grazing over the past 2 years. We are determined to
complete this process within 60 days counting from the day the 1st
positive test result arrived (18 May 2007), and we are hoping to find
no more sign of the disease.
Meanwhile, all cattle from the Bridger herd are quarantined and will
soon be slaughtered and the owners compensated through a livestock
appraisal process paid for by USDA:APHS:VS. Individual cows, heifers
and bulls from a 2nd herd owned by the extended family have been
tested, and all results revealed no disease. This herd will be
retested in 30 days and again in 120 days to complete the
investigation from the birth herd of the original index cow. Montana
must remain clean from brucellosis for 2 years after discovering the
1st positive herd for the state to retain our brucellosis-free
status. If testing confirms brucellosis in a 2nd herd of Montana
cattle, the state will drop from brucellosis-free status to Class A
status.
Before they can be exported, 18-month and older heifers, cows and
bulls from a Class A state must demonstrate negative results (no
brucellosis) from blood tests within the 30-day period before
shipping. Already, North Dakota has restricted imports of Montana
breeding stock, requiring a health certificate, individual
identification and a negative brucellosis test within 30 days of
importation. This testing requirement does not apply to steers or
spayed heifers. Cattle grazing bordering counties will be evaluated
on a case-by-case basis.
Montana's 1.4 million beef cattle comprise the 7th largest herd in
the nation. Montana leads the U.S. in quality seedstock, the breeding
heifers, cows and bulls that are shipped nationwide and overseas.
While comparatively small, Montana's domestic bison (19 000 in 2002)
and dairy cattle (28 000 cows and heifers) enterprises also
contribute significantly to our state's largest economic driver. If
Montana were to lose its brucellosis-free status, all 18-month-old
and older reproductive cattle shipped out of state would be tested
for brucellosis within 30 days of transport, costing Montana
producers an estimated USD 5 million to USD 15 million annually. All
Montana cattle exports would need to test negative for the disease
over the course of the investigation. That investigation could last
from one to several years before the state regains its
brucellosis-free status.
Cattle producers can vaccinate against brucellosis when livestock are
4 to 10 months old.
Many, if not most, Montana producers voluntarily protect their stock
from this economically devastating disease, but the vaccine is only
60 percent to 85 percent effective. That is better than no
protection, but not a guarantee.
The urgency of our ongoing investigation is a great inconvenience for
livestock owners and their animals.
The process requires a lot of extra work from everyone involved. We
are grateful for all the cooperation and help we're receiving from
producers in this trying time. One way or another, science will
determine the outcome of this process.

[The state of Montana has approximately 5 more weeks to finish
trace-ins (animals being brought into the herd) and trace-outs
(animals leaving the herd) and its epidemiology report to the USDA,
APHIS. Clearly from this letter, in 1st person, the acting state
veterinarian is cautiously concerned about the state's coveted "free"
status. - Mod.TG]
