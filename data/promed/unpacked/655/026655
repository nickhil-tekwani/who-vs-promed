Foot and mouth disease in Botswana
----------------
Information received on 15 Jun 2006 from Dr. Musa Fanikiso, Director
of Animal Health and Production, Ministry of Agriculture, Gaborone:

Report date: 15 Jun 2006.

Identification of agent: foot and mouth disease (FMD) virus serotype SAT1.

Date of start of the event: 1 Jun 2006.

Details of the outbreak: The outbreak occurred in a village in
Muchenje in the Kasane district. Out of a population of 1969, 57
cases occurred and there was no slaughter of any animals in the
population. Kasane is the gateway to Chobe National Park and is
located close to where Zimbabwe, Zambia and Namibia meet the Northern
edge of Botswana. [See map

Affected population: The current clinical cases identified range from
calves to adults of both sexes. Oral and feet lesions of varying
severity were common with one case presenting small teat vesicles.
The predominant breed is the Tswana.

Laboratory where diagnostic tests were performed: Botswana Vaccine
Institute, Gaborone

Results: tissue samples were tested with typing ELISA and virus
isolation. They were positive for serotype SAT1 on 7 Jun 2006.

Source of outbreaks or origin of infection: contact with wild animals.

Other details/comments:

- The infected herds are in FMD control zone 1, a FMD-vaccinated area
bordered by the Caprivi (Namibia) to the north and Chobe National
Park on the east, south and west. This is the 2nd of the 4 extension
areas (Pandamatenga, Kasane, Kachikau and Satau) affected in zone 1
(see Disease Information, 18 [33], 261, dated 9 Aug 2005). This is a
communal area with 3 crushes, of which Muchenje presented the index cases.

- The infected area has 523 goats, no sheep and no pigs. There is a
significant African buffalo (_Syncerus caffer_) herd that moves out
of the western side of Chobe National Park to drink along the river
that forms the international boundary with Namibia (Caprivi region).
Cattle are routinely vaccinated with an inactivated trivalent SAT FMD
vaccine every 4 months. The area has been blockaded on either side
stretching for about 25-30 km with strategically placed disinfection
points. Movement of cloven-hoofed animals and their products has been
restricted to the infected area. Cattle are being herded to control
their movements and reduce transmission between herds. Screening of
other herds is being conducted to determine the extent of the spread
of the disease. The extension area was last vaccinated in March 2006
with inactivated trivalent SAT 1, SAT 2 and SAT 3 FMD vaccine.

- This zone has always been considered a high FMD risk area because
of the presence of buffalo. Vaccination is done 3 times a year and
there is a permanent movement ban on cloven-hoofed animals and their
products from this zone to the rest of the country and outside. This
outbreak therefore does not pose any significant risk to national,
regional and international trade in cloven-hoofed animals and their products.
