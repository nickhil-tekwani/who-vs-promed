A reliable source reports 7 suspected cases and 3 deaths during the last 2
weeks in Grand Cape Mount county in the northern area, with serological
results positive for IgG and IgM at the Institute Pasteur, Dakar.
The population at risk is estimated at 150 000. WHO is supplying vaccines
and equipment for a planned vaccination campaign.
Travellers should note that northern Liberia has frontiers with Sierra
Leone & Guinea, which are also part of the jungle yellow fever endemic zone.
