Health minister, Dr Osagie Ehanire, has revealed that 22 persons have tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19), among the 1473 persons of interest tested since the reopening of the nation's international airspace. Ehanire disclosed this at the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 briefing yesterday [8 Oct 2020] in Abuja, and said these persons were among the passengers who recently returned from overseas.

According to him, "We are especially worried about the huge COVID increases in certain countries with which we have high volume of human traffic. The Federal Ministry of Health, therefore, wishes to advise Nigerians against non-essential travel to high burden countries. The risks that the movement of travellers creates can only be countered with improved surveillance programmes. I wish to especially solicit that all travellers cooperate with border authorities to protect our people and also our health system from stress. We are obliged to reduce the risk of COVID importation to a minimum. As of 26 Sep [2020], of a total of 1473 persons of interest (POI) tested across 3 laboratories in the FCT [Federal Capital Territory] since the opening of the international travel air space, 22 tested positive."

The minister further noted that "Our testing and tracing capabilities have improved a lot, such that virtually every state has at least one laboratory that has increased our daily testing capacity to about 3500. We are, however, testing well below that capacity because laboratories are receiving fewer samples than they could handle, leaving some partners to doubt our reports. I, therefore, appeal to state governments to improve on sample collection and capacity utilisation. All persons with COVID evocative symptoms or who may have come in contact with a confirmed COVID case should please submit themselves for testing," the minister said.

Meanwhile, the Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika, has revealed that Emirates Airlines would begin operations into Nigeria today [9 Oct 2020] as the United Arab Emirates (UAE) had resumed issuing of visas to Nigerians.

Sirika also stated that of the passengers who have returned since the opening of the airspace, 27 persons have been found to have fake COVID-19 test results or none at all. He said that the airlines that brought them in would face the penalty as stipulated before reopening of the airspace. He also revealed that all planes coming into Nigeria were expected to carry only 200 passengers and the situation would remain so for now.

[The easing of travel restrictions due to the coronavirus disease outbreak has had repercussions in Nigeria. In the above report, about 1.5% of returning travellers have tested positive for the disease. Nigeria is one of the main travel hubs in West Africa, and with further resumption of operations of more airlines, there is the potential to have more confirmed cases since some countries that are frequently travelled to and from are having a 2nd surge of infection.

In Nigeria, as of today (10 Oct 2020), there are 59 992 reported confirmed cases of coronavirus disease and 1113 deaths. So far, only 548 514 tests have been conducted in an estimated population of 200 million in Nigeria (https://covid19.ncdc.gov.ng/). There is gross undertesting even though there are accredited labs for testing in every state of the federation. This means the actual case numbers may be underreported. - Mod.AA

Abstract
--------
Background
In face of the coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 pandemic, best practice for mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is intensely debated. Specifically, the rationale for high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and prone positioning in early COVID-19 ARDS has been questioned.

Methods
The 1st 23 consecutive patients with COVID-19 associated respiratory failure transferred to a single ICU were assessed. 8 were excluded: 5 were not invasively ventilated and 3 received veno-venous ECMO [extracorporeal membrane oxygenation] support. The remaining 15 were assessed over the first 15 days of mechanical ventilation. Best PEEP was defined by maximal oxygenation and was determined by structured decremental PEEP trials comprising the monitoring of oxygenation, airway pressures, and trans-pulmonary pressures. In nine patients the impact of prone positioning on oxygenation was investigated. Additionally, the effects of high PEEP and prone positioning on pulmonary opacities in serial chest x-rays were determined by applying a semiquantitative scoring-system. This investigation is part of the prospective observational PA-COVID-19 study.

Findings
Patients responded to initiation of invasive high PEEP ventilation with markedly improved oxygenation, which was accompanied by reduced pulmonary opacities within 6 hours of mechanical ventilation. Decremental PEEP trials confirmed the need for high PEEP (17.9 (SD Â± 3.9) mbar) for optimal oxygenation while driving pressures remained low. Prone positioning substantially increased oxygenation (p less than 0.01).

Interpretation
In early COVID-19 ARDS, substantial PEEP values were required for optimizing oxygenation. Pulmonary opacities resolved during mechanical ventilation with high PEEP suggesting recruitment of lung volume.

Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed without language restriction for studies published from database inception until [15 Aug 2020], with the terms "SARS-CoV-2" or "COVID-19" and "ARDS", or "mechanical ventilation", or "PEEP", or "prone positioning", or "respiratory failure" and found no relevant articles pertaining to COVID-19 ARDS. To our knowledge, there have been no reports on PEEP titration in conjunction with the assessment of radiographic changes and lung mechanics in early COVID-19 ARDS.

Added value of this study
We demonstrate that patients with early COVID-19 ARDS can benefit in terms of oxygenation from mechanical ventilation with high PEEP as well as from prone positioning.

Implications of all the available evidence
COVID-19 ARDS lung exhibits remarkable high lung compliance but despite its unique nature we show here that COVID-19 ARDS patients benefit from high PEEP and respond well to prone positioning regarding oxygenation. Our findings provide evidence that may help guide intensivists in the treatment of early COVID-19 ARDS.

[The use of proning in COVID-19 associated respiratory distress has been shown to reduce the need for invasive ventilation methods and permitted treatment with supplemental oxygen in early respiratory distress. Coppo et al in a clinical trial showed preliminary efficacy with 50% of trial subjects improving and not requiring additional interventions following the proning. Elharrar et al demonstrated a 20% increase in oxygenation in non-mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients (in a case series) through the use of proning. Similar improvements were found by Sartini et al in their case series. Koeckerling D et al, present some interesting discussions into the debate on the use of proning and long term efficacy, albeit mentioning studies that suggest significant reductions in mortality through the use of proning. Its use in management of COVID-19 appears to be debated among pulmonary specialists. In Mittermaier et al (the article above), they mention the debates ongoing on the appropriate mechanical ventilation strategy and were able to demonstrate an improvement in oxygenation as well as lung opacities following the use of PEEP with mechanical ventilation in combination with proning.

[The weekend reporting artifact is clear today as Spain, Sweden, and Costa Rica (to name a few countries) have not reported any newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, and other countries such as Brazil and Kazakhstan have marked reductions in their 24 hour newly confirmed cases. India and the USA are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations, with India in the 2nd position in terms of cumulative case counts and dominating in terms of newly reported cases. In the past 24 hours, these 2 countries -- India (67 757), followed by the USA (46 493) -- have maintained their dominance. A global total of 3950 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (10-11 Oct 2020), also representing a marked reduction.

Countries reporting more than 5000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (10 countries) include India, USA, France (16 101), Russia (13 634), UK (12 872), Argentina (10 324), Colombia (8567), Belgium (7950), Netherlands (6373), and Italy (5456). A total of 39 countries have reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 16 of the 39 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 8 were from the Americas region, and 8 were from the Eastern Mediterranean region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase in case counts by 12.2%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 0.59%.

Impression: Global 7-day averages continue to increase, in spite of the weekend artifact lowering the 24 hour changes. A common observation is that while there are increases in reported cases, there had been a decrease in reported deaths that appears to be starting to increase by very small increments (less than 1%). Keeping the transmission dynamics in mind, it would not be surprising to see an increase in deaths in 3-4 weeks following the increase in cases (see section [1] above). - Mod.MPP]
