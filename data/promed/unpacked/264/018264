actually said in Germany, ProMED sent him some questions, to which he has
kindly replied -- see below. - Mod.JW]

From: "Masato Tashiro, NIID JPN" <mtashiro@nih.go.jp>

Thank you for your mail. My answers are:
1) you were indeed in Hunan Province
No, I was not there this time.
2) the dates you were there
I have visited there before.
3) you were part of a WHO mission
I was not a member of the WHO mission this time.
4) you showed a slide in Germany showing more than 300 deaths from avian flu
As an example of unauthorized information, I showed a slide which I received
from a private source. This indicates more than 200 deaths distributed in
several provinces.
5) you were told that 7 of the cases resulted from human-to-human transmission.
The information I received indicated some human-to-human transmission cases,
although details were not clear.
Regards,
Masato Tashiro

[ProMED is very grateful to Dr Tashiro for this further clarification.
