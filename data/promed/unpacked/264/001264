The mosquito that is responsible for transmitting Zika virus and yellow fever is closing in on Portugal, after Spanish authorities announced they found eggs from the mosquito in the border regions.

According to newspaper i, authorities from the Spanish province of Extremadura announced that they have detected the presence of the Asian tiger mosquito (_Aedes albopictus_) in Monesterio [in Badajoz province, part] of the Extremadura region, which borders with a thick belt of central and southern Portugal, roughly from the Serra da Malcata and Castelo Branco in the north, to Amareleja and Barrancos (Alentejo) in the south.

A team of researchers at the University of Extremadura placed thousands of traps in April [2018], where the eggs that are compatible with the tiger mosquito have now been detected. The autonomous region has already adopted a set of containment measures, among them the disinfestation of the areas that can accommodate the insect, which is recognisable by its black body with white stripes on the head, thorax, legs, and abdomen.

[Extremadura extends westward in Spain to the border of Portugal. This mosquito is established along the southern coast of Spain to Gibraltar (see the map of its European distribution as of June 2018 at https://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/aedes-albopictus-current-known-distribution-june-2018).

The containment measures that are mentioned above are needed to prevent establishment of that mosquito and its move into Portugal. There have been a few sporadic outbreaks of dengue and chikungunya virus fevers along the European Mediterranean coast. Should _A. albopictus_ become established in Extremadura, the risk for transmission of these viruses extends to the west and interior of Spain. - Mod.TY
