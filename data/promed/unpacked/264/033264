The man was quarantined at Tibet's Third People's Hospital in Lhasa, the regional health and family planning commission said.

He was involved in live poultry trade since arriving in Lhasa in February 2017, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

His symptoms were reported to the regional disease prevention and control centre on 2 Apr 2017, and his condition was confirmed on 3 Apr 2017.

He is the 1st human infection of H7N9 bird flu in Tibet. Following the diagnosis, live poultry trading has been suspended across the region. All those who had been in close contact with the patient have been put under medical observation, the report said.
