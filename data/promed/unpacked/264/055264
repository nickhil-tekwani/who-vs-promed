Possible Outbreak of _Shigella_ in Panama
---------------------------------------
The Director of the Metropolitan Health Region (Panama City) announced an
outbreak of diarrheal disease, attributed to _Shigella_. The number of
reported cases of diarrhea (130) is considered to be above the expected
number of cases. In addition, there have been a few (laboratory) confirmed
cases of _Shigella_ (number not specified).
Health authorities will be tightening sanitary inspections on food
retailing businesses as a measure to control possible foodborne sources.
