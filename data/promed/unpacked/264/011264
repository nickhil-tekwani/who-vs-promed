On the other hand, 7 patients with atypical pneumonia died recently in the

(1); PWH (3).
[The transcript of a press conference/briefing by the deputy director of
health, Dr Leung Pak-yin, and the director (Professional Services and
Public Affairs) of the Hospital Authority, Dr Ko Wing-man, on the latest
situation of atypical pneumonia on 22 Mar 2003 is available at
<http://www.info.gov.hk/dh/ap.htm>. The additional information in this
briefing of note is that 9 clusters are under investigation involving the
above given total of 222 patients. The mention of 9 clusters suggests that
there have been 9 introductions of SARS identified in Hong Kong to date
that then resulted in clusters of cases in close contacts (either medical
personnel involved in their treatment, or in family members) related to
these 9 cases. In addition there was mention of a death of an elderly
patient with other medical conditions in addition to the presumptive
diagnosis of SARS. - Mod.MPP]

Enhanced precautionary measures to break SARS transmission 22 Mar 2003
-------------------------------
As at 22 Mar 2003, a total of 44 people with SARS have been reported to the
Ministry of Health. The 5 additional patients reported today comprise 4
hospital staff and 1 close contact of a patient. Three patients have been
discharged from hospital. The other 41 patients are still in hospital. All
the patients are stable except for 8 patients who are in a serious condition.
To date, apart from the 3 initial people who had travelled to Hong Kong, a
total of 20 family, friends and those who had close contacts with the
cases, and 21 hospital staff have been diagnosed with SARS. So far, all the
cases of SARS have been linked to the initial 3 cases. No new index cases
have been reported. In addition, no further cases have occurred among
hospital staff as a result of infection from known or suspected cases of
SARS after the implementation of enhanced infection control precautions.
Though the SARS situation in Singapore is contained, the Ministry of Health
is stepping up precautionary measures to cut off secondary transmission
especially among hospital staff and reduce risk of any community spread.
These include:
A) Centralising all suspected and probable SARS cases
At present, the vast majority of suspect and probable cases of SARS are
being isolated and treated in TTSH and CDC. As these cases require
isolation facilities for up to 2-3 weeks, the initial provisions made by
TTSH and CDC to handle these cases are becoming fully utilised. At the same
time, TTSH is continuing to carry its normal hospital load of clinical care
and this is stretching staff and other resources.
In view of these considerations, the decision has been made to continue to
manage all suspected and probable cases, including pediatric cases,
centrally at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) and the Centre for Communicable
Diseases. This will facilitate the management of these patients and reduce
the risk of secondary transmission of the disease. To free up TTSH's
resources to isolate and treat all SARS cases, TTSH will not admit new
patients for the next 2 weeks. As such, ambulance cases will be diverted to
other hospitals and the public will be advised to seek accident and
emergency care at other hospitals. TTSH will also scale down its specialist
outpatient clinics activities over the next 2 weeks. TTSH has also
cancelled elective surgeries which might require intensive care unit wards.
B) Added protection measures for hospital staff
No further cases have occurred among hospital staff from infection from
recognised cases since we implemented enhanced precautions and control
measures. However, we are not taking any chances with any possible
unrecognised cases. TTSH and CDC will be instituting tighter measures to
break the cycle of transmission among hospital staff. These include
physically cordoning off areas in TTSH which manage suspected or probable
SARS patients. Entry of staff and relatives will be closely controlled.
There will also be an exclusive set of hospital staff dealing with SARS
patients and they will not perform outpatient clinics and other inpatient jobs.
As an added protective measure, hospital staff in open wards in TTSH and
not treating SARS patients will also observe enhanced infection control
measures. These include wearing masks, gloves and gowns. Existing non-SARS
patients in TTSH who are currently being treated as inpatients will
continue to be managed there. There should be no cause of concern for these
patients, as they will continue to be kept physically separate from SARS
patients who will be under isolation.
C) Precautionary measures for schoolchildren
[see ProMED-mail Severe acute respiratory syndrome - worldwide (14)
20030321.0704, recommendations are unchanged from posting of 21 Mar 2003 -
Mod.MPP]
D) Pay heed to travel advice and symptoms
The public should continue to avoid travel to Hong Kong, Hanoi and
Guangdong province in China for the time being, unless absolutely
necessary. This would help us greatly in our efforts to contain the number
of new cases.

*Case definition <http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/casedefinition.htm>
[According to a press briefing on 21 Mar 2003
(<http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/transcripts/t030321.htm>) there are 3
possible cases in close contacts of suspected SARS cases. "In one cluster,
an individual who traveled to Asia may have been the source of infection in
2 health care workers who provided care, and in the second situation, one
person who traveled to Asia may have been the source of infection in a
family member." In addition, there was mention that 2 of the 22 suspected
cases mentioned above had a history of staying on the 9th floor of the
Kowloon Hotel implicated in the original transmission of SARS in Hong
Kong.The CDC SARS website has information on recommended isolation and
infection control and information on respiratory protection for patient
management. <http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/>. - Mod.MPP]

A third death due to SARS has occurred in the past 24 hours. This death
occurred in one of the previously reported cases from Ontario [see:

In this update we are presenting the latest available numbers of suspected
cases of SARS. As of the time of this report (22 Mar 2003 5:30 PM EST)
there are 386 cases with 11 deaths reported to WHO from 14 countries.
According to the newswires there was another death in a case from Canada.
To date cases continue to occur among close contacts of previously
identified SARS cases. With the implementation of infection control
precautions in the hospital setting, it appears as though transmission to
health workers involved in the care of SARS patients has been markedly
reduced. - Mod.MPP]
