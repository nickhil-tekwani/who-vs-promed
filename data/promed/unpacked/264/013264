An invasive mosquito thought to have been eradicated from the San Diego region 14 years ago was found during routine trapping in Barrio Logan, the county Department of Environmental Health reported today [23 Sep 2015].

The Asian tiger mosquito [_Aedes albopictus_] is similar to another insect found locally for the1st time last year [2014], _Aedes aegypti_, sometimes called the yellow fever mosquito.

Both mosquitoes are small, with distinctive black and white markings, and they like living in urban areas and indoors, and generally feed during daylight hours, according to the DEH. Native mosquitoes like to feed at dusk and dawn.

The agency said the mosquitoes can breed in very small amounts of water inside and outside of homes, like flowerpots, saucers and tires.

The Asian tiger mosquito and the yellow fever mosquito are capable of transmitting diseases [viruses] like yellow fever, chikungunya and dengue fever to people, but those tropical illnesses are only seen in San Diego County when travelers contract them elsewhere and return here.

Because of their disease-carrying potential, officials are trying to prevent the mosquitoes from establishing themselves in the state. They're asking residents to dump out any standing water inside and outside their homes and report to county vector control if they're bitten indoors during daytime.

According to the DEH, the Asian tiger mosquito, native to tropical and subtropical Southeast Asia, was 1st found in Southern California in 2001 and was believed to have hitchhiked its way in on imported nursery items. San Diego County officials believed they had eradicated the insect that year.

The pest has infested communities in Los Angeles County and has been spreading in the last year and a half, according to the agency.

San Diego County vector control teams have been putting up additional monitoring traps for the mosquito near where it was found and handing out information to urge the public to be on the lookout for the pest and eliminate standing water.

[_Aedes aegypti_ has been found at several locations in California in past years. Introductions of this mosquito were detected and eradicated in California in 1971 and 1987 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20110914.2805). In 2001, the Asian tiger mosquito was found in 2 northern and 4 southern counties of California. This mosquito did not spread to California from the ongoing invasion in eastern and central U.S. but was introduced into the state in shipments of ornamental bamboo ("Lucky Bamboo") from South China. Rapid detection of introduction and control efforts prohibited the spread of this species throughout California http://cisr.ucr.edu/asian_tiger_mosquito.html. _Ae. albopictus_ was also found in southern California in 2004 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20040920.2598) but was eliminated.

_Ae. albopictus_ is very versatile in its breeding sites, so eradication will be a significant challenge. ProMED will be interested in the progress of the control program as it goes forward.

A CDC map showing the distribution of _Ae. albopictus_ as of 2000 can be accessed at http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/arbor/albopic_97_sm.htm.

Travelers who have been infected with dengue and chikungunya viruses arrive in California with some frequency. Should _Aedes albopictus_ and _Ae. aegypti_ populations become established, there is a real risk of ongoing transmission initiated by an incoming viremic individual. However, these viruses may not become endemic in southern California because of screens and air conditioning, and especially because of effective vector control that most areas in California have. However, the risk remains for sporadic introduction of these viruses with limited outbreaks.

The counties in California where these mosquitoes have been found over the past 3 years illustrate 2 critical points; (1) the importance of ongoing surveillance to detect their presence very early on while they are still geographically limited, and (2) rapid response by vector control officials and the public. One hopes that the eradication efforts are successful.
