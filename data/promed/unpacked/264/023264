Snow mold ravages fields
------------------------
Now that most of the snow has melted from Northwest fields, poor,
withered winter wheat stands have shown up in several areas around the
region. The damage is the likely result of snow mold, said Juliet
Marshall, University of Idaho.

The snow mold fungus thrives under an insulating cover of snow. In
some areas, snow fell on unfrozen ground in November [2010] and stayed
for months, providing the perfect breeding ground for the disease to
develop, she said. "The longer that snow cover is there, the more
opportunity for the fungus to take advantage of the weakened plant."

100 days of continuous snow cover is enough for snow mold to develop.
The fungus took out "whole patches" of winter wheat stands in some
areas of Eastern Idaho, Marshall said. The worst hit fields have
suffered about 50 percent damage. Damage has shown up in both dryland
and irrigated wheat fields, but is probably worse in dryland areas
simply because those fields tend to be at higher elevations.

Washington State University [WSU] researchers have observed extensive
snow mold damage in winter wheat test plots at Almira. The damage
ranged from zero to 100 percent, depending on variety, said Stephen
Guy, WSU. "This is a fairly unusual event for that location," he
said.

[2] Tan spot - Australia: (Queensland) alert

Red alert for yellow spot
-------------------------
Western Downs consultant Vic French, Queensland, is warning growers
of the real and present danger of damaging yellow [tan] spot levels in
2011 winter cereal crops. He says wheat stubble, either standing or
displaced during the floods, is carrying visible inoculum which could
cause headaches for growers if the wet conditions continue into winter
and spring.

"The stubble is just riddled with yellow spot. If we get 2 or 3 wet
periods and moist conditions we are going to have a big problem with
the disease. We advocate a spray schedule with fungicide." Mr French
urges growers to choose yellow spot resistant or tolerant varieties
from the 2011 Grains Research and Development Corporation (GRDC) wheat
variety guide.

Greg Platz, Agri-Science Queensland, agrees there is a big danger of
cereal disease in 2011 and that proactive crop monitoring is the 1st
step in disease management. He said epidemics develop when susceptible
varieties are sown over wide areas in the presence of plentiful
inoculum under favourable environmental conditions. "Due to the wet
summer it is a given that stubbles from crops that were infected in
2010 will be very infective in 2011," he said.

[3] Cereal cyst nematode - Australia: re-emergence (Western
Australia)

Wheat disease making a comeback
-------------------------------
A soil-borne disease that cost Australian wheat farmers over [AUD]
100 million [approx USD 107 million] in lost production 30 years ago
is making an unwelcome comeback. Cereal cyst nematode (CCN) is a
microscopic worm that lives on the roots of the wheat plant and causes
significant yield loss.

When first detected during the 1970s in South Australia and Victoria,
breeders developed new disease-resistant wheat varieties. However,
it's now been found in Western Australia for the 1st time.

Julie Nichol from CIMMYT (International Wheat and Maize Improvement
Centre) says farmers need to be educated on disease. "Farmers still
need to use those resistant cultivars in their rotational mixes." It's
not just a problem for Western Australia. All wheat farmers should be
concerned as more than 10 million hectares [about 25 million acres] of
wheat growing area is affected by CCN.

Ms Nichol [also] said that in China there are numerous species and
pathotypes of CCN whereas Australia only has one. She says work needs
to be carried out to develop resistance to these numerous pathotypes
and species to reduce the biosecurity threat to Australia.

[Snow moulds
-----------
Snow moulds of wheat include several fungal species. Pink snow mould
is caused by _Monographella nivalis_ var. _nivalis_. It attacks plants
during wet, cool weather, but is not dependent on snow and can also
cause seedling and head blights of cereals, as well as contribute to a
number of other disease problems in co-infection with other pathogens.
Pink snow mould produces masses of microscopic spores on pink growth.
Speckled snow mould is caused by several _Typhula_ species, some of
which are restricted to areas with prolonged deep snow cover. Speckled
snow mould is grey-white and affected plants tend to bleach and
shatter easily. The speckling is due to dark sclerotia (fungal bodies)
and may or may not be present.

The snow moulds survive in dead leaves of affected plants, or as
sclerotia in soil, and generally affect a number of cereal and grass
hosts. The pathogens are most aggressive at low temperatures. Symptoms
are most apparent in early spring when the snow first melts. Plant
vigour may be markedly reduced, and in severe cases, the crowns are
killed. Surviving plants recover slowly and are sensitive to
additional stresses. Disease management includes cultural practices,
fungicide applications, and the use of host cultivars suitable to the
region which also have increased levels of resistance or tolerance to
the snow moulds.

Tan spot
--------
Tan spot (also called yellow leaf spot or blotch) is caused by the
fungus _Pyrenophora tritici-repentis_. It affects wheat but can also
attack barley, triticale, rye, and some grasses. Tan spot may cause
yield losses of up to 50 percent in favourable environments especially
under minimum tillage systems which are widely used in Australia.
Symptoms include characteristic tan leaf lesions with dark centre and
yellow surrounds which may merge to form large necrotic areas;
discolouration of glumes and seeds leading to downgrading of grain;
and short, spindly plants with reduced tillering and root development.
Plants may be fully defoliated soon after flowering. Symptoms are
generally seen later in the season in the middle and upper canopy, but
young plantlets from infected seed can show leaf spots.

The pathogen survives mainly as dormant mycelium on stubble and crop
debris. Wet conditions are necessary for spore production and
infection of growing plants resulting in rapid development of an
epidemic within a crop. Long distance spread to other crops and areas
may occur by strong winds, with infected seed or other plant material.
Disease management includes cultural measures (removal of stubble by
ploughing or burning), crop rotation, and fungicides as seed
treatments and foliar applications. Host field resistance is poorly
understood and many commercial wheat cultivars are susceptible.

Cereal cyst nematodes
---------------------
Cereal cyst nematodes (CCN) include _Heterodera avenae_ and other
species in the genus. They can cause significant yield losses on most
cereal crops when populations are high.

Roots of infested plants develop frequent branches and swellings
(cysts) leading to severe stunting and even death of the plants.
Seedlings weakened by CCNs often are invaded by soil-borne pathogens,
especially root and crown rots. Above-ground symptoms appear early in
the season as pale green patches, yellow lower leaves, and reduced
tillering. All wheat cultivars are susceptible, but some do not
support cyst formation.

The pathogens can often persist in the soil for years as cysts and
are spread by plant material, soil, and mechanical means (for example
contaminated equipment). Once they have been established in an area,
it is difficult to control or eradicate them. Disease management
requires an integrated approach including phytosanitary and cultural
measures, nematicides, crop rotation with non-cereal hosts, and the
use of partly resistant cultivars to keep populations below
economically significant thresholds. Elimination of cyst nematodes
from infected fields is usually not possible.

Different _Heterodera_ species can affect a range of crops, for
example soybean, maize, and potato.
