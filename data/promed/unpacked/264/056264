Tests from a 4th patient have now confirmed the presence of Anthrax.
Two of these 4 known confirmed cases have now died. A further heroin
drug injector has died, but tests to determine the presence of
anthrax have yet to be completed [Since this release was issued, this
5th case has been confirmed. - Mod.MHJ]. The 2 surviving confirmed
anthrax-linked patients are responding well to treatment, one at
Glasgow's Victoria Infirmary and one at Monklands District General
Hospital in Lanarkshire.

NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde's Public Health Protection Unit are
continuing to work closely with NHS Lanarkshire, the Procurator
Fiscal's Office, and Strathclyde Police to identify the source of the anthrax.

One avenue which is still being investigated by Public Health and
Strathclyde Police is that contaminated heroin or a contaminated
cutting agent mixed with the heroin may be responsible for the infections.

Dr Syed Ahmed, Consultant in Public Health Medicine, said: "There
have been no new drug injecting heroin users with suspected or
confirmed infections admitted to hospitals in the west of Scotland
since the weekend. I urge all drug injecting heroin users to be
extremely alert and to seek urgent medical advice if they experienced
an infection. Drug injecting is extremely risky and dangerous. The
possible presence of a batch of heroin contaminated with anthrax
makes drug injecting even riskier and even more dangerous. While this
section of the community need to be on their guard, the risk to the
rest of the population -- including close family members of the
infected cases -- is negligible. It is extremely rare for anthrax to
be spread from person to person, and there is no significant risk of
airborne transmission from one person to another."

As part of ongoing inquiries, any drug-injecting heroin users who
present with serious soft tissue infections now or who have presented
such during the last 4 weeks are being investigated.

[One of the problems with cutaneous anthrax is the black escar, and
those not used to seeing cases take it as pathognomonic.
Unfortunately, staph skin infections can and do produce a similar
appearance, thus the necessity of getting laboratory confirmation.
Something else to keep very much in mind is that these heroin-related
infections from injecting a mess of soluble acidic chemicals result
in extensive deep tissue necrosis.

Injection infections are not uncommon with heroin addicts and usually
involve surface pathogens and clostridia. There is an awareness now
in the UK to think one step further on the assumption that singular
cases of anthrax may be occurring and are being missed. However these
bacillus spores get into the cut drug, it is probable that the mixing
is by hand. This will result in an uneven mix such that some addicts
will get no spores, others large acutely lethal doses, and the
majority something in between. When there is a cluster of cases,
their geographic and temporal proximity make it easy to recognize an
unusual event. But when they are strung out -- as in one here, one
there, a swollen injection site somewhere else, and maybe a number of
just happy addicts -- the existence of such a contaminated product
can be hard to perceive and observe.

If you add to that the empirical treatment with antibiotics by a GP
prior to the individual presenting himself or herself at their local
hospital, you have further reduced the chances of recognition.

At the start, the reports were optimistic about the survival of cases
after the index lethal case. To date, the lethality rate is 60
percent. Normally, cutaneous anthrax cases have a CFR of 0-10
percent. This should bring home the appreciation that these
heroin-related cases are not your usual occupational cutaneous
infections resulting from the contamination of a scratch.

There is a report in The Times of London, but it is essentially just
a rewrite of the NHS news release:
<http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article6967068.ece>.
The comments are revealing.

The good news is that this outbreak is getting the attention and
investigation that it deserves in the UK. - Mod.MHJ]
