The recent outbreak of cholera in the Kenema township has [cost] the lives
of some people and many more admitted in hospitals and clinics around the
township, a Kenema Town Council source revealed to Awareness Times over the
weekend.
Sources say even the surrounding areas of Kenema were not spared. In
Nyandeyama Town, 5 people reportedly died of the outbreak, including 2
children. According to Mr. Emmanuel Massaquoi, a health officer attached to
the Kenema Town Council, there have been increased reports of cases of
vomiting which have been associated with diarrhea since June 2006; he also
noted that between 24 Jun and 3 Jul 2006, some 51 cases were reported among
which 5 deaths were also recorded.
The Health Officer however stated that the District Health Management Team
(DHMT) in collaboration with the Hospital Management Board (HMB) have held
an emergency meeting to map out strategies as to how to contain the seeming
pandemic.

The WHO said here on Wed, 5 Jul 2006, a cholera outbreak in Angola that
broke out mid-Feb 2006 has claimed more than 2003 lives from out more than
48 000 cumulative cases.
In its latest update on the epidemic that has infected 48 817 in 14 of
Angola's 18 provinces, the WHO said that 89 new cases of the disease and 2
deaths were recorded in the last 24 hours. According to WHO, 35 percent of
cholera victims have been children aged under 5.
Although the UN agency said there were signs the epidemic was slowing in
the provinces of Kwanza Norte, Bengo and Malange, the medical charity
Medicines Sans Frontiers (MSF) had noted it had worsened in Namibe and
Luanda provinces.

local Government, chaired by local governor, Manuel Francisco Gomes Maiato.
Most of the deaths were recorded in the localities of Cafuba and Bananeira,
where sanitation is poor and people [drink contaminated] water.

A cholera epidemic has killed 133 people in southeastern Guinea, a health
ministry official in the West African country said on Wed, 5 Jul 2006.
Mahy Barry, director of the ministry's national infectious disease
prevention service, said 133 people had died out of 1376 cases recorded
since 12 Jun 2006, "and at least 300 people are still hospitalised in
serious condition."
The epidemic has struck the regions around Kissidougou and Lola, around 500
kilometers southeast of the capital Conakry.
Tests carried out last week revealed that the epidemic stemmed from
infected wells used by large numbers of people. Traditional wells of the
type from which the test samples were taken are usually built in the midst
of family properties, near toilets.

[5] Watery diarrhea - Guinea-Bissau (Bissau)

A surge in cases of watery diarrhea has raised concerns of an impending
cholera outbreak in the crumbling capital Bissau.
"In recent days we have received a lot of cases of intense diarrhea among
children and adults. It is for this reason that we have decided to
reinforce the measures of control to avoid the spread of diarrhea," said
Placido Cardoso, the director general of health.
The Health Ministry has ordered the closure of all traditional wells in the
capital and urged the suspension of traditional ceremonies in an effort to
prevent large gatherings that might facilitate the spread of disease.
But many Bissau residents say they have no choice but to draw their water
from traditional wells as the street taps where they collect their water
are frequently switched off over non-payment of water bills.
It was not immediately clear to health authorities whether any of the
diarrhea cases represented cholera, which has become a recurring problem in
impoverished Guinea Bissau.
In 2005, Guinea Bissau bore the brunt of a cholera epidemic that afflicted
over 42 000 people across West Africa. Some 26 000 people were stricken and
more than 400 died of the water borne disease in tiny Guinea Bissau alone.
The first cases of cholera in West Africa in 2006 have already been
confirmed in Niger and neighboring Guinea.

A Tai Po Hui Market fish stall has been closed after _V. cholerae_ was
found in a sample taken from its fish tank. The sample was collected 26
Jun 2006 as part of the Food & Environmental Hygiene Department's routine
surveillance program.
The stall will remain closed until the department is satisfied with its
overall hygiene condition and that there is no immediate health hazard.
_V. cholerae_ cannot survive high temperatures and can be killed by
thorough cooking. People should pay attention to personal and food hygiene
and be extra cautious in consuming seafood and ready-to-eat food,
particularly during the summer months.
