From: BOBS@niv.ac.za (Prof R Swanepoel)
[EdRegis@aol.com questioned the statement in (02) that the Gabonese doctor
sick with Ebola had NOT arrived in S. Africa by scheduled airline. Here is
Dr Swanepoel's response - Mod.JW
The doctor from Gabon travelled on a scheduled flight of the national
carrier, accompanied by two persons who returned to Gabon within days, i.e.
before the diagnosis of Ebola was made. Neither of the accompanying persons
became ill. The patient was ambulant, not stretcher-borne, but very ill and
must have had an uncomfortable journey.
The referral of the patient to South Africa was organized by one of several
companies engaged in international medical care. Some African countries
provide state funds for referral abroad of their citizens in need of medical
care not available at home. The same facility is offered to expatriates
employed in Africa by the companies which employ them. A further group
involves tourists, and particularly adventurous "eco-tourists" who travel
the length of Africa in open trucks: they are almost invariably covered by
medical insurance taken out as part of the deal by the tour company, and are
often flown here for medical care even if they become ill elsewhere. The
tourist category also includes our own citizens who travel abroad, and
sometimes these people have medical insurance which covers
evacuation/repatriation in case of illness or trauma.
Most of the patients referred from African countries fall into the following
categories:
- those with cardiac problems often requiring surgery,
- those with chronic renal problems requiring dialysis and/or transplants,
- those with neoplastic conditions requiring surgery and/or therapy, and
- those with orthopaedic problems.
Complications of pregnancy are also referred here. This country has always
made these services available to Africa, but the political changes have led
to increased utilization, and the favourable exchange rate vis-a-vis
European and North American currencies, together with the availability of
sophisticated medical care, have helped to make South Africa an attractive
option.
The companies which arrange transfer of patients use scheduled flights where
possible, but in dire emergencies or the transport of stretcher cases, they
use charter companies which specialize in medical evacuation.
The majority of patients referred from Africa with emergency conditions
enter via one of three airports in the Johannesburg area, and new health
regulations are being applied on a trial basis at these airports. Companies
bringing in patients must make prior notification to the relevant Port
Health Authority. In general, patients with chronic health problems or
trauma will be permitted entry, but those with acute infectious disease
resembling viral haemorrhagic fever may be debarred from travelling,
although entry cannot be denied to South African citizens.
Persons travelling of their own accord with a health problem are more
difficult to screen, but it is in any event a standard requirement that
captains of commercial flights sign a declaration which should report any
cases of illness on board. It is a problem to know what becomes notifiable,
since even travel sickness varies in severity.
Moreover, travellers can become ill with suspected or genuine viral
haemorrhagic fever some days after arrival, and so an option which is being
tried is that those who disembark from flights from African countries to the
north of South Africa are handed a pamphlet in the arrivals hall which
advises that the passengers or doctors who attend them should notify
stipulated health authorities in the event that the passenger develops an
undiagnosed febrile illness within three weeks of arrival.
[The USA used to issue a "yellow card" to travelers arriving from tropical
countries, to be shown to a physician in case they developed an infectious
disease within 2 or 3 weeks of arrival. As far as I can remember, it
instructed the physician to advise the public health authority - Mod.JW
Sick travellers or those incubating disease can, of course, arrive at other
airports in the country, or by road at multiple entry points, or at sea
ports, and ultimately revised regulations will be applied universally.
Meantime awareness has been increased at ports of entry.
No formal screening can extend to illegal immigrants who cross at multiple
points of Africa's "leaky" borders, but such routes often involve extended
slow travel on foot on either side of borders, and this possibly acts as a
natural screening for acute disease. We have no evidence that such people
pose a threat here with regard to haemorrhagic fevers, but there is
potentially two-way traffic in the region in conditions such as tuberculosis
and HIV infection.
In the final analysis, no country in the world can institute an entirely
leakproof screening system at its borders, and hence it is of the utmost
importance to have a safety net composed of elements which:
1) facilitate early clinical recognition of exotic diseases,
2) provide access to laboratory expertise geared to rapid confirmation of
the diagnosis,
3) have available designated facilities with well-drilled staff able to cope
at short notice with appropriate barrier-nursing of patients, and
4) trained teams and contingency plans for dealing with the multiple aspects
of outbreak control.
