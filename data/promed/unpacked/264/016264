Event No. 9 of 2015: following event No 8 [Idra cave, near Moshav Meron, Upper Galilee; posting 20150521.3374571] the district veterinary office was informed on 21 May 2015 that the rabid dog had bitten a person in the adjacent village, Moshav Meron. During a visit paid to the said location on the same day, the veterinary inspector noticed a 2-year-old male border-collie tied to a pole in the yard of the bitten person (who had already been post-exposure treated). Questioning revealed that his dog had had direct contact with the rabid dog [event 8]. The dog was found not to be electronically identified (chipped) nor vaccinated against rabies. The dog, which did not show suspected clinical signs, was put under observation in the rabies detention observation kennel in nearby Zefat. After 4 days, on 25 May, the dog showed behavioral changes, increased sensitivity, and aggression [howls for no reason, instability, attempts to bite, etc.]. The next day posterior paralysis was observed. The dog was euthanised (against protests of the owner) and sent to the national rabies laboratory at the Kimron Veterinary Institute, Beit-Dagan, where rabies was confirmed.

[Since tha start of 2015, 9 rabies cases have been diagnosed in Israel, all along the borders with Syria and Lebanon: 6 dogs, 2 wolves, and 1 cat; see map at
http://www.vetserv.moag.gov.il/NR/rdonlyres/4796CB9F-FAA4-4DDB-BD1F-E7EB9B4A68EB/0/%D7%9B%D7%9C%D7%91%D7%AA2015.jpg.

According to the Israeli rabies legislation, dogs above the age of 3 months must be vaccinated against rabies with an officially approved vaccine and must be identified (by a prescribed electronic transponder) by a State, Municipal or Authorised veterinary practitioner, followed by annual renewal of the certificate and of the vaccination. The apparent breaching of the regulations, particularly in the rabies-stricken northern parts of the the country, indicate deficiencies in public education and of obedience to the law. These deficiencies require the due attention of the public health and particularly the veterinary authorities.

According to information from the public health authorities, for which we are grateful, the number of exposed -- or suspected as exposed -- members of the public who had to be medically treated in relation to events 7 and 8 is (so far) 12 and 23, respectively. These 2 dogs had been transported by their owners to Haifa and to the Tel-Aviv metropolitan area, respectively. Hopefully, all exposures have already been detected, allowing timely preventive treatment. - Mod.AS
