Two new cases of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in Texas captive deer, including the 1st confirmed from a live test tonsillar biopsy sample, have been validated. The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) and Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) are conducting an epidemiological investigation into these new cases.

One case involves a 3 1/2-year-old captive raised white-tailed doe that was born and raised on-site and died on-site of natural causes at a deer breeding facility in Medina County where the disease had not previously been found. Test samples were submitted in compliance with TAHC herd plan requirements.

The live test finding is from a 2 1/2-year-old captive white-tailed buck in the Uvalde-Medina County deer breeding facility that was the source of a CWD positive white-tailed buck harvested by a hunter from a release site on the same ranch.

With these new confirmations, 10 white-tailed deer in or originating from deer breeding facilities have been confirmed positive for CWD in the state since the original detection in June 2015.

Tissue samples revealed the presence of CWD prions during testing at the Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory (TVMDL) in College Station. The samples were submitted to the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa, which validated the suspect findings Friday evening [1 Apr 2016].

The disease was 1st recognized in 1967 in captive mule deer in Colorado. CWD has also been documented in captive and/or free-ranging deer in 24 states and 2 Canadian provinces. In Texas, the disease was 1st discovered in 2012 in free-ranging mule deer along a remote area of the Hueco Mountains near the Texas-New Mexico border, and last summer [2015] was detected in 2 separate captive white-tailed deer breeding facilities in Medina and Lavaca counties.

CWD among cervids is a progressive, fatal disease that commonly results in altered behavior as a result of microscopic changes made to the brain of affected animals. An animal may carry the disease for years without outward indication, but in the latter stages, signs may include listlessness, lowering of the head, weight loss, repetitive walking in set patterns and a lack of responsiveness. To date there is no evidence that CWD poses a risk to humans or non-cervids. However, as a precaution, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization recommend not to consume meat from infected animals.

More information on CWD can be found on TPWD's website, http://www.tpwd.texas.gov/CWD, or at the Chronic Wasting Disease Alliance website, http://www.cwd-info.org.

Six more cases of CWD found in Newton County
--------------------------------------------
Six more deer from the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission [AGFC]'s chronic wasting disease sampling effort have turned up positive, according to the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory in Madison. This brings the total of CWD-positive cases of Arkansas deer and elk to 56.

All 6 deer that tested positive came from Newton County inside the sampling focal area. The final results from the intensive sampling effort should be available late next week.

Although a true prevalence rate cannot be determined until the last of the samples come in, the high number of positive results has already prompted a 2nd sampling effort to determine whether the disease is present in other parts of the state. AGFC biologists and wildlife officers will begin collecting samples from road-killed deer and any sick or dead deer reported throughout Arkansas.

Anyone who witnesses a sick, dead or road-killed deer or elk should contact the AGFC's radio room at 800-482-9262. Operators are available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Reports will be sent to the appropriate person to collect samples.

Deer or elk infected with CWD tend to stay away from herds, may lose their fear of humans, walk in patterns, carry their head low, salivate excessively and grind their teeth. As the disease progresses, the animal will lose weight, develop an insatiable thirst and lose bodily functions.

The AGFC is holding weekly public meetings at Carroll Electric Cooperative, 511 E. Court St. in Jasper to update the public on the results from its sampling efforts. The next meeting will be at 11 a.m., [7 Apr 2016].

[While the Texas case does not represent a true expansion of the disease it does represent that a test on a living animal has been confirmed as positive, although it appears to be waiting confirmation form the National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL). The deer is in the same county where other CWD cases have been found.

Likewise, the Arkansas cases do not represent an expansion of the disease but an increase in the number of positives as this was an intensive cull to establish a type of prevalence rate. While that rate has not yet been determined, it might be that Arkansas has found more than they anticipated. - Mod.TG
