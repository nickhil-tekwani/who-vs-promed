Event description
-----------------
The Lassa fever outbreak is ongoing in Liberia with 25 new suspected cases, including 5 deaths reported since our last bulletin update (Weekly Bulletin 11, 16 Mar 2018). Of these, 2 new confirmed cases were reported in week 12 and week 13 (week ending 1 Apr 2018).

The patient reported in week 12 [week ending 25 Mar 2018] was a 2-year-old female with symptom onset on 22 Mar 2018, who was admitted to hospital in the capital city, Monrovia on 29 Mar 2018 with symptoms of fever, malaise, vomiting, difficulty in breathing and later, convulsions. Clinical suspicion was Lassa fever [virus] infection and following collection of a blood sample on 29 Mar 2018 the patient tested positive for Lassa fever virus by RT-PCR at the National Reference Laboratory. The patient died on the day of admission and a safe burial was conducted.

A retrospective investigation was conducted which established that the mother, a 33-year-old from Grand Bassa county died on 22 Mar 2018. She sought care at the district hospital on 18 Mar 2018 where the clinician suspected a viral haemorrhagic fever and isolated her. Following a negative test for Ebola virus on 20 Mar 2018, a positive RT-PCR result for Lassa virus was received on 30 Mar 2018. A total of 47 contacts from these 2 confirmed cases were identified, of which 60 percent are healthcare workers and are under follow up.

From January 2018 to date, a total of 67 suspected cases, including 19 deaths (case fatality rate 28.3 percent) have been reported from 6 counties. Of the total suspected cases, 9 were confirmed positive by RT-PCR at the National Reference Laboratory. The confirmed cases originated from Nimba (4 cases), Montserrado (3), Bong (1), and Grand Bassa (1); 8 of the 9 confirmed cases died, a case fatality rate of 89 percent. The confirmed cases are predominately female (78 percent) and the age range among confirmed cases is 1 to 57 years old with a median age of 32 years.

Public health actions
---------------------
- The county health team continues to coordinate the response to the outbreak, with technical support from the Ministry of Health, the National Public Health Institute of Liberia (NPHIL), WHO field offices, MSF [Médecins Sans Frontières], and OXFAM.
- Active surveillance and contact tracing are ongoing in the affected counties, who are sharing information to aid investigation and contact tracing.
- The outbreak case definitions, along with patient screening tools which were adapted for previous outbreaks, remain in use.
- The National Public Health Reference Laboratory continues to provide laboratory diagnostic services and courier services have been strategically designated across the country to facilitate transport of specimens.
- An infectious disease isolation unit has been set up in Montserrado county to manage patients with Lassa fever.
- Lassa fever risk exposure assessment was conducted by a team of infection, prevention, and control (IPC) specialists with respect to healthcare worker contacts in Montserrado and the MSF hospital has initiated chemoprophylaxis (oral ribavirin) for the high-risk contacts.
- Community engagement activities have begun in the affected communities with rapid response teams visiting the affected households and families, and providing information on the event.
- Antiviral medication (ribavirin) has been prepositioned at designated treatment sites to facilitate management of future cases.

Situation interpretation
------------------------
Lassa fever is endemic in certain parts of Liberia, with sporadic outbreaks during 2017, resulting in 30 confirmed cases reported from 7 counties. This year shows a similar pattern, with 9 confirmed cases to date from 4 counties. Although the Liberian government together with WHO and other health partners has built on lessons learned from response to previous outbreaks, more effort is needed to reinforce the response plan to prevent new cases and decrease the case fatality rate. As well as preventing human-to-human transmission through effective IPC practices, rat-to-human transmission needs to be minimized, requiring a One Health approach, which will entail effective social mobilization and community engagement strategies targeting vector control and environmental management especially in endemic areas. The fact that such a high proportion of contacts were healthcare workers emphasizes the need for continuing logistical and operational support to healthcare facilities to build effective isolation units, holding areas and clinical waste management disposal systems as well as ongoing training to reduce the risk of infection of healthcare workers.

[The number of confirmed Lassa fever cases in Liberia has increased by 5 cases since the last report on 22 Mar 2018 with the total currently at 19. Liberia, a West African country, is endemic for Lassa virus. Lassa fever cases have been reported sporadically there. The Lassa fever belt in Liberia primarily occupies Lofa, Bong, and Nimba counties across the northern tier of counties bordering Guinea. West Africa, including Guinea and Liberia, is endemic for Lassa fever virus.

The situation where these people acquired Lassa fever virus is not indicated in these cases except for the 2-year-old girl, who likely got the virus from her infected mother. Virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or its excreta, as was likely the situation in these cases. Rodent control has to be undertaken at the village level with individual households employing the preventive measures listed above. This requires an extensive and continuous public education effort. Transmission also occurs in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed and barrier-nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients.
