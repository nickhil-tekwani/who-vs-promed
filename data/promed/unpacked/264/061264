1st report of brown rot caused by _Monilinia fructicola_ on imported peach
in Hungary
--------------------------------------------
M Petroczy, L Palkovics, Department of Plant Pathology, Corvinus University
of Budapest, H-1118 Budapest, Villanyi Road 29-43, Hungary. Plant Dis 2006;
90: 375, published online as DOI: 10.1094/PD-90-0375B. Accepted for
publication 14 Dec 2005.
Brown rot caused by _Monilinia fructicola_ is one of the most important
diseases of peach. The pathogen is included in the EPPO A2 list of
quarantine organisms for Europe (2). _M. laxa_ and _M. fructigena_ are
common in Hungary, but _M. fructicola_ has never been reported in orchards,
in trade, or in markets. In early October 2005, brown rot was observed on
imported peaches from Italy and Spain at a vegetable market and some
supermarkets in Budapest. The variety of peach was identified as
'Michellini' by colleagues in the Department of Pomology of Corvinus
University. The pathogen was identified as _M. fructicola_ on the basis of
morphological and molecular characteristics. Symptoms began with a small,
circular brown spot, and the rot spread rapidly. At the same time, numerous
small, grayish stromata developed. Finally, the whole surface of the fruit
was covered with conidial tufts. The conidia were one-celled, lemon-shaped,
hyaline, 15.7 x 10.3 micrometers, and produced in branched monilioid chains.
Conidia from infected fruit were transferred to potato dextrose agar.
Fungal mycelium grew at a linear rate of 10.7 mm per 24 h at 22 deg C in
the dark. The color of the colony was grayish, and the sporulation showing
concentric rings was abundant (sporulation is sparse in _M. laxa_ or _M.
fructigena_). The colony was not rosetted and the margin was not lobed, in
contrast with _M. laxa_. Pathogenicity was tested by inoculating
surface-sterilized, mature peach fruits with conidia. Inoculated and
control fruits were placed in a sterilized glass container at room
temperature. After 5 days of incubation, typical brown rot symptoms
developed on inoculated fruits while control fruits remained healthy. _M.
fructicola_ was reisolated from the inoculated fruits. PCR was used to
identify the fungus (1). Species-specific internal transcribed spacer (ITS)
primers for _M. fructicola_, _M. laxa_, and _M. fructigena_ were used to
amplify the DNA of isolates. 3 type-cultures were used as the positive control.
Following the removal of the mycelia from the agar, total DNA was extracted
using a cetyltrimethylammonium bromide extraction. The nucleic
acid-containing pellet was resuspended in RNase containing Tris-EDTA
buffer. DNA quality was assessed by gel electrophoresis on 1 per cent
agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. The molecular genetic
identification method confirmed the results of morphological
identification. To our knowledge, this is the first report of _M.
fructicola_ on peaches in Hungary or in eastern Europe.

[The fruit of the crop plant peach, _Prunus persica_, is susceptible to the
disease brown rot both on and off the tree. The disease is caused by
species of the fungus _Monilinia_. This article describes the first report
in Hungary and in Eastern Europe of _M. fructicola_ on peaches imported
from Italy and Spain. Other species of _Monilinia_ are known to rot peaches
in Hungary, so this is not the first report of brown rot. The significance
of the observation has to do with the fact that the pathogen is included in
the EPPO A2 list of quarantine organisms for Europe. It was detected for
the 1st time in Europe in 2001 (in France).
Brown rot is a destructive disease of peach and other stone fruits (plum,
nectarine, apricot, and cherry), affecting blossoms, fruit, spurs, and
small branches. It is most important on fruits just before ripening and
during and after harvest. Under favorable conditions for disease
development, the entire crop can be completely rotted. Peaches not kept in
cool storage may rot in 2 to 3 days. Disease management involves use of
phytosanitary measures (removal and destruction of rotted fruit, mummies,
and neglected trees as possible inoculum sources); pruning of cankers
during the dormant season; and insect control to avoid insects that feed on
punctured or bruised fruit in the orchard or during harvesting and packing.
Fruit should be cooled and refrigerated (as close to 0 deg C as possible)
immediately after harvest.
