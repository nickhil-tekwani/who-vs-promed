The Pennsylvania Game Commission is investigating the cause of death of more than 35 deer in Beaver and Cambria counties, but epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) is suspected, and with cases of the fatal deer disease present in 2 counties so far apart, you can bet there will be cases in Washington and Greene counties as well.

If so, it would mark the 1st widespread outbreak of EHD -- which is transmitted by biting midges that usually live in or near water and wet, muddy areas -- since it ravaged the deer herd in our area in 2007, killing hundreds if not thousands of deer.

Game Commission biologists recently submitted 3 samples to the Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study at the University of Georgia for testing from deer found in Greene Township and Ohioville Borough in Beaver County, and Summerhill Township in Cambria County.

The commission will continue to gather samples from other dead deer being found in other municipalities. Samples must be collected within 24 hours of the animal's death for the samples to be viable because of decomposition.

"While we must wait for test results to confirm just what caused these deer to die, at this time, we are suspecting that the deer died of EHD, based on field signs that we are seeing," said Dr. Walter Cottrell, Game Commission wildlife veterinarian.

Earlier this month [August 2012], EHD was confirmed in Oklahoma and Nebraska.

Once contracted, EHD usually kills the deer within 5 to 10 days. It is not spread from deer to deer, however, the disease is usually found in small areas or pockets because of its transmission via bug bite. The disease usually runs its course when the 1st frost kills the biting midges.

Deer infected with EHD initially lose their appetite and fear of humans, grow progressively weaker, often salivate excessively, and develop a rapid pulse and respiration rate and fever. Affected animals frequent bodies of water to lie down in to reduce their body temperatures before they finally become unconscious. Death is the usual result, though some animals do recover.

While humans are not susceptible to EHD, deer displaying severe symptoms of EHD may not be suitable for consumption.

Game Commission Southwest Region Director Pat Anderson is urging residents to report sightings of sick-looking deer, particularly those found near water, by calling the Region Office at 724-238-9523. The Southwest Region serves Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Cambria, Fayette, Greene, Indiana, Somerset, Washington and Westmoreland counties.

In 2011, EHD was confirmed in Northampton and Erie counties, though on a smaller scale [than in 2007].

EHD was confirmed in Washington and Greene counties in 2007 and 2002 and was suspected to be the cause of death in nearly 25 deer in Adams County in 1996.

The epizootic hemorrhagic disease viruses can infect most wild and domestic ruminants. Clinical signs are seen mainly in white tailed deer, with mule deer and pronghorn antelope affected to a lesser extent. Other wild animals found to be seropositive include black-tailed deer, red deer, wapiti, fallow deer, and roe deer. Rare outbreaks of EHD have been reported in cattle. Sheep can be infected experimentally but rarely develop clinical signs, and goats do not seem to be susceptible to infection.

The viruses of the EHDV serogroup are transmitted by biological vectors, usually biting midges in the genus _Culicoides_. In North America, _C. variipennis_ is the major vector. Some species of gnats and mosquitoes can also transmit EHDV. Infected deer can be viremic for up to 2 months.

The incubation period for epizootic hemorrhagic disease in deer is 5 to 10 days.

Three syndromes may be seen in deer. Peracute disease is characterized by high fever, anorexia, weakness, respiratory distress, and severe and rapid edema of the head and neck. Swelling of the tongue and conjunctivae are common. Deer with the peracute form usually die rapidly, typically within 8-36 hours; some animals may be found dead with few clinical signs. In the acute form (classical EHD), these symptoms may be accompanied by extensive hemorrhages in many tissues including the skin, heart, and gastrointestinal tract. There is often excessive salivation and nasal discharge, which may both be blood-tinged. Animals with the acute form can also develop ulcers or erosions of the tongue, dental pad, palate, rumen, and omasum. High mortality rates are common in both the peracute and acute forms.

In the chronic form, deer are ill for several weeks but gradually recover. After recovery, these deer sometimes develop breaks or rings in the hooves caused by growth interruptions, and may become lame. In severe cases, animals slough the hoof wall or toe; some of these deer may be found crawling on their knees or chest. Deer with the chronic form may also develop ulcers, scars, or erosions in the rumen; extensive damage to the lining of the rumen can cause emaciation even when there is no shortage of food.

Among the Cervidae, epizootic hemorrhagic disease is most severe in white-tailed deer. In this species, the morbidity and mortality rates may be as high as 90 percent. However, the severity of the disease varies from year to year. It also varies with the geographic location. In the southeastern U.S., most cases are mild and the mortality rates are low. In the Midwest and Northeast, EHD typically recurs each year but can vary from a few scattered cases to severe epizootics with high mortality rates. This variability is thought to be caused by many factors including the abundance and distribution of the insect vectors, the EHDV serotype, existing herd immunity, and genetic variations in the susceptibility of the host. Surviving deer develop long-lived neutralizing antibodies. Nearly 100 percent of the deer population can be seropositive in some regions.

In deer, the differential diagnosis includes foot-and mouth disease (FMD), bluetongue, and plant photosensitization. A hemorrhagic disease caused by an adenovirus has also been described in deer in California.

EHD is a reportable disease in some states. Other states regard it as endemic. However, even in those states because of the similarity of some clinical signs with FMD, it is still required/recommended to notify appropriate authorities.

Epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) is one of the most important diseases of deer in North America. The epizootic hemorrhagic disease viruses (EHDV) are widespread in white-tailed deer and periodically cause serious epidemics in wild populations.
