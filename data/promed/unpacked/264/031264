Just prior to publication of Poliomyelitis (01): Pakistan (GB), global, RFI 20170314.4898724, a request for more information on the polio case reported in the media from Bilgit-Baltistan was submitted to the EpiCore Surveillance Project. A response was received very rapidly, and according to an EpiCore Surveillance Project member, the virus identified was a wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) with genetic linkages to WPV1's isolated from Lahore environmental samples taken during 2016. In addition, the date of onset of the symptoms was 13 Feb 2017 [not 4 months earlier as suggested by the media report].

[ProMED-mail would like to thank the EpiCore Surveillance Project member who clarified the situation ongoing in Gilgit-Baltistan. The isolation of a WPV1 from a case of paralytic polio that is genetically related to one isolated from environmental samples in 2016 in Lahore suggests significant "silent" circulation of the WPV1 in Lahore and now possibly in Gilgit-Baltisan, suggesting suboptimal vaccination coverages in areas felt to be polio-free within Pakistan.
