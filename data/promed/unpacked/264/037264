Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -- update
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The following cases of laboratory confirmed Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have been reported from Jordan, Lebanon, the Netherlands, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States.

Netherlands
-----------
On 14 May 2014, the National IHR Focal Point for the Netherlands notified WHO of the 1st laboratory confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection in the Netherlands. The patient is a 70 year-old male citizen of the Netherlands, with travel history to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia between [26 Apr 2014] and 10 May 2014.

The patient developed 1st symptoms on 1 May 2014 while in Medina, Saudi Arabia. He was evaluated at an emergency care department in Mecca on [6 May 2014] and given antibiotics; he did not have respiratory symptoms while in Saudi Arabia. On return to the Netherlands, on [10 May 2014], his condition deteriorated, including development of respiratory symptoms, and he was hospitalized on the same day. On [13 May 2014], he tested positive for MERS-CoV. Currently, the patient is in the ICU in a stable condition.

The patient reports no contact with animals or consumption of raw animal products. Identification of close contacts, including flight contacts has been initiated.

United States of America
------------------------
On 12 May 2014, the United States IHR National Focal Point reported the 2nd laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV infection in the United States in a male health-care worker in his 40s, who lives and works in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

He travelled to the United States from Jeddah on 1 May 2014 on commercial flights via London Heathrow with travel from London to Boston, Massachusetts; from Boston to Atlanta, Georgia; and from Atlanta to Orlando, Florida.

The patient has a history of contact with 2 MERS-confirmed cases. He is in a stable condition. He is reported to have no history of travel and no history of contact with animals.

Tracing and screening of 6 family members and 24 health-care workers for MERS-CoV is currently ongoing.

Lebanon
-------
On 8 May 2014, the National IHR Focal Point (NFP) of Lebanon reported the 1st laboratory-confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection.

On [22 Apr 2014], a 60-year-old male health-care worker and national of Lebanon complained of high-grade fever. On [27 Apr 2014], he was diagnosed with pneumonia and was admitted to the hospital on [30 Apr 2014]. His symptoms included fever, dyspnoea, and productive cough. On 2 May 2014, he tested positive for MERS-CoV. He is reported to have comorbidities. He was in a stable condition in hospital and was released on 7 May 2014.

The patient is reported to have no contact with laboratory confirmed cases or with animals and no history of raw camel milk consumption. No history of travel was reported in the 14 days prior to onset of symptoms.

The patient is known to travel throughout the Gulf region, particularly to Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and UAE; investigations into the patient's travel history are ongoing. His most recent travel was 5 weeks prior to symptom onset to UAE and 8 weeks prior to symptom onset to Jeddah where he visited one of the hospitals that had been facing an upsurge of MERS-CoV cases.

Globally, 572 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV have officially been reported to WHO, including 173 deaths. The global total includes all of the cases reported in this update (18), plus 58 laboratory confirmed cases officially reported to WHO from Saudi Arabia between [5 and 9 May 2014]. WHO is working with Saudi Arabia for additional information on these cases and will provide further updates as soon as possible.

WHO advice
----------
Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. Health-care facilities that provide for patients suspected or confirmed to be infected with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus from an infected patient to other patients, health-care workers and visitors. Health care workers should be educated, trained and refreshed with skills on infection prevention and control.

It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because some have mild or unusual symptoms. For this reason, it is important that health-care workers apply standard precautions consistently with all patients -- regardless of their diagnosis -- in all work practices all the time.

Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to all patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection. Contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection. Airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.

Patients should be managed as potentially infected when the clinical and epidemiological clues strongly suggest MERS-CoV, even if an initial test on a nasopharyngeal swab is negative. Repeat testing should be done when the initial testing is negative, preferably on specimens from the lower respiratory tract.

Health-care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations. All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.

People at high risk of severe disease due to MERS-CoV should avoid close contact with animals when visiting farms or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. For the general public, when visiting a farm or a barn, general hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals, avoiding contact with sick animals, and following food hygiene practices, should be adhered to.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

[3] Netherlands, 2nd case - media report
Date: Thu 15 May 2014
Source: CNN [edited]
http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/15/health/mers-outbreak-netherlands/


A 2nd case of the potentially deadly MERS virus has been identified in the Netherlands, a spokeswoman for the country's National Public Health Institute told CNN. It comes one day after authorities confirmed the 1st case.

The cases in the Netherlands involve 2 family members who had traveled together to Saudi Arabia.

It is one man and one woman who contracted the disease, said Harald Wychgel, spokesman for the Netherlands ministry of health.

The health ministry, citing privacy reasons, did not provide additional details except to say that the pair shared a room for 2 weeks in Saudi Arabia.

Officials do not know if one person infected the other or if both became infected at the same location. One of the 2, however, had visited a camel farm. It is estimated that nearly 75 percent of dromedary -- or single-hump camels -- in Saudi Arabia have come into contact with the MERS virus, researchers said in February [2014].

"It is also known that both patients have underlying conditions that make them probably more susceptible to infection with this virus," the health ministry said in a statement.

The announcement comes as the World Health Organization said the spread of the virus has become more urgent, but at least for now, is not calling it a global health emergency.

The 1st cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome were diagnosed in the Arabian Peninsula in 2012. MERS attacks the respiratory system, and symptoms can lead to pneumonia or kidney failure.

There have been over 570 confirmed cases of MERS, including 171 deaths, according to the World Health Organization.

Many of the cases are in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

Even without any official worldwide alert, Anne Schuchat, the head of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, acknowledges that "this is a relatively new virus that does have a high fatality rate," ample reason to pay attention. Authorities haven't pinned down all the details about how exactly it arose and how it spreads, though Schuchat said, "We don't have evidence right now that this is airborne ... the way the measles virus is."

Two cases have been confirmed in the United States. Both patients are health care providers who were working in Saudi Arabia. Those cases are in Indiana and Florida.

Dutch, Saudi, Jordan reports boost MERS tally
---------------------------
A 2nd MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) case was reported in the Netherlands today, while Saudi Arabia cited 3 new cases. In addition, scientists said serologic testing has retrospectively confirmed 7 more cases in the 1st known MERS-CoV outbreak, which occurred in Jordan in April 2012.

Also today, the World Health Organization (WHO) released an update that confirmed and added information on 18 recent cases, including 14 in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and single cases in the Netherlands, the United States, Jordan, and Lebanon.

2nd Dutch case linked to 1st
The new case in the Netherlands involves a female relative of the country's 1st case-patient, a man who fell ill after a recent trip to Saudi Arabia, according to the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment. A computer translation of the statement was posted on Avian Flu Diary, an infectious disease blog.

The agency said the woman, like the man, became infected in Saudi Arabia, and she is now in "strict isolation" and stable condition. She and the man shared a hotel room for 2 weeks, and both have underlying conditions, the statement said.

Today's WHO statement said the 1st Dutch patient is a 70-year-old Dutch citizen who traveled to Saudi Arabia between [26 Apr 2014] and [10 May 2014]. He first felt ill while in Medina on [1 May 2014], and on [6 May 2014] he was examined in Mecca.

He had no respiratory symptoms until his return home on [10 May 2014], and he was hospitalized the same day, the WHO said. He is now in stable condition in an intensive care unit (ICU).

3 more cases in Riyadh
The 3 new cases reported in Saudi Arabia today include 1 death. All 3 are in Riyadh, which is a hotbed of recent MERS activity, ranking 2nd behind Jeddah in the number of cases.

The fatal case involved a 54-year-old woman who had chronic conditions and was hospitalized [3 May 2014] with an arteriovenous fistula, the Saudi Ministry of Health (MOH) said in its update. She experienced respiratory symptoms on [5 May 2014] and was subsequently moved to an ICU; she died on [13 May 2014].

A 2nd case-patient is a 70-year-old woman who has chronic conditions but has no symptoms and is in home isolation, the MOH said. The other patient is a 39-year-old woman who has diabetes and was hospitalized with respiratory symptoms on [24 Apr 2014]. After twice testing negative for MERS-CoV, she tested positive on [13 May 2014], and she is in stable condition.

The MOH didn't give any information about how the 3 women were exposed to the virus, nor did it say whether any of them are healthcare workers (HCWs).

The new cases raise Saudi Arabia's MERS tally to 514 cases with 160 deaths.

The ministry also reported 2 deaths in previously reported cases, involving a 72-year-old woman and a 63-year-old man, both in Jeddah.

Jordan cases retrospectively confirmed
The earliest known MERS-CoV outbreak occurred in a Zarqa, Jordan, hospital in April 2012, but it was not recognized as such until November 2012, after the virus had been identified and described as a result of cases in Saudi Arabia.

The outbreak involved 13 pneumonia cases, including 2 deaths. Investigators previously confirmed MERS-CoV in the 2 fatal cases by testing stored specimens, leaving the other 11 cases in the suspected category. Now Jordanian and US investigators have confirmed 7 more cases through serologic (antibody) tests, according to their report published yesterday in Clinical Infectious Diseases.

The authors interviewed and collected serum samples from 124 people, including the outbreak patients, their household contacts, HCWs, and field investigators from the Jordanian health ministry. Among those tested were 9 of the 11 surviving outbreak patients.

Seven people tested positive for MERS-CoV antibodies on at least 2 of 3 serologic tests, increasing the outbreak count to 9. Of the 7 newly confirmed cases, 6 were surviving outbreak patients, and 5 were HCWs, according to the report.

With 6 HCWs among the 9 cases in the outbreak, the attack rate among potentially exposed HCWs was 10 percent, the authors found. There was no evidence of MERS CoV transmission at 2 hospitals to which outbreak patents were transferred and which, the authors said, had better infection control practices than the outbreak facility.

Of the 9 cases in the outbreak, 6 people were male, and the median age was 40 years. Most of the patients had no major preexisting conditions, although 2 had hypertension. Their relative youthfulness and their generally good underlying health probably explains why the outbreak case-fatality rate of 22 percent was lower than has been observed in MERS cases generally, the authors say.

The authors determined that each of the serologically confirmed case-patients had been exposed to at least 1 patient whose infection was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction.

The study shed no light on the source of the virus: The authors found no evidence that any patients had contact with camels, and none of them had traveled to or received visitors from the Arabian Peninsula before they got sick.

WHO update
Most of today's WHO update deals with 14 MERS cases reported by the UAE, but it also reviews recent US, Dutch, Lebanese, and Jordanian cases.

The UAE cases were reported to the WHO on [8 Apr 2014, 8. and 11 May 2014]. Seven of the 14 patients are described as HCWs and several of them as expatriates. The age range is from 30 to 68 years. Three patients were listed as asymptomatic.

Most of them had no contact with other confirmed cases, and none reported contact with animals, according to the statement. Several of the cases were identified as a result of general screening at their workplaces.

The WHO provided some new details on Lebanon's 1st MERS case, which was reported a week ago in media reports that contained very little information. The WHO said the patient is a 60-year-old male HCW and Lebanese national who got sick on [22 Apr 2014].

He was hospitalized on [30 Apr 2014] and tested positive for MERS-CoV 2 days later, the agency said. On [7 May 2014] was he was released from the hospital.

Eight weeks before his illness, the man had traveled to Jeddah, where he visited one of the hospitals that recently has had a surge of MERS cases, the WHO said. In addition, he visited the UAE 5 weeks before his illness, but he did not travel in the 2 weeks before he got sick.

The WHO increased its global MERS count to 572 cases, including 173 deaths. The number includes 58 cases that Saudi Arabia reported to the agency from [5 to 9 May 2104]. The WHO said it is gathering more information about those cases in preparation for providing further updates.

Florida HCWs test negative
In developments related to the 2nd imported US MERS case, the Florida Department of Health (FDH) in Orange County said today that the patient, hospitalized in Orlando, continues to improve and that tests are negative for all HCWs who had contact with him.

Yesterday health officials announced that tests cleared 2 health workers who had flu-like symptoms after unprotected contact with the patient, a HCW who lives and works in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and started feeling ill on a flight to visit the United States. The 44-year-old man sought care on [8 May 2014] at a Florida hospital, and tests on [11 May 2014] revealed that he was infected with MERS-CoV.

[According to the WHO report above, the global tally of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection now at 572 including 173 deaths. This is up to date including Saudi reported cases through 9 May 2014. Since 9 May 2014, there have been 41 additional laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV infections including 27 deaths reported on the Saudi MOH website, and a 2nd case was reported by the Netherlands (see above section [3] for details). As the WHO reports have not mentioned the retrospectively serologically confirmed cases in Jordan, this moderator presumes that they should also be added to the global tally, so that the addition of these cases and deaths would bring the global tally to 621 cases including 200 deaths.

Noteworthy is that while 1 of the 2 cases in the Netherlands had a history of visiting a camel farm (the 2nd reported case), the other case had a history of visiting an emergency room in Mecca (the 1st reported case) -- both activities considered to be potential exposure risks. There isn't mention whether the 2nd reported case had accompanied the 1st reported case to the Emergency Room as well. (the original alert posted on the RIVM [National Institute for Public Health and the Environment Netherlands website in Dutch can be found at:http://www.rivm.nl/Documenten_en_publicaties/Algemeen_Actueel/Nieuwsberichten/2014/Tweede_MERS_patient_in_Nederland).

Other noteworthy information in the above reports is the retrospective confirmation of 7 additional cases involved in the 1st documented outbreak of MERS-CoV infections in Jordan in 2012 through improved serologic testing procedures.

The information on the potential risk exposures of the Lebanese case is curious as the potential known risk exposures occurred weeks prior to the onset of illness of this patient (travel to Saudi Arabia and the UAE). It is also curious that the individual is a health care worker. One wonders if this individual had been exposed to undiagnosed MERS-CoV infected individuals in the health care environment in Lebanon, perhaps individuals returning to Lebanon from travel in the Arabian Peninsula.

For a map showing the Arabian Peninsula, see https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=2474996,131. For a good map showing where cases have been reported/confirmed globally, see Figure 2 in the MMWR report: First Confirmed Cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) Infection in the United States, Updated Information on the Epidemiology of MERS-CoV Infection, and Guidance for the Public, Clinicians, and Public Health Authorities - May 2014. 14 May 2014 early release, 16 May 2014, 63(19);431-436, available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6319a4.htm?s_cid=mm6319a4_w. - Mod.MPP]
