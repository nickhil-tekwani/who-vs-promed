Almost 30 000 livestock have been imported to Northern Ireland from
bluetongue-infected areas of Europe since the start of the year
[2008], the Belfast Telegraph can reveal today [Sat 16 Feb 2008].

This is despite appeals to farmers from Agriculture Minister Michelle
Gildernew to "wise up" and stop risking agriculture, as the
province's 1st case of the killer disease was confirmed [The term
"1st case" is rather strong and deserves moderation; see commentary. - Mod.AS].

Since the start of January 2008, 4184 cattle and 20 304 sheep have
been imported from bluetongue-infected areas, including 26
consignments from the Netherlands, which included the infected animal.

It is understood that dairy cattle in the Netherlands are selling for
lower prices than normal because of the country's disease status.

The infected heifer has now been slaughtered, and the Department of
Agriculture is in the process of tracing associated herds.

Northern Ireland is still regarded as bluetongue-free.

The minister said she has no power to ban imports of animals from
bluetongue-infected areas under EU law but appealed to farmers not to
put us at risk by bringing them in. "On the dairy side, prices have
been fairly steady and buoyant, and there isn't really any excuse to
bring in heifers from bluetongue-infected areas," she said. "I am
asking them for the sake of the industry not to import bluetongue
from infected areas, she said."

Traditional Unionist MEP Jim Allister said the detection of the case
reminds everyone to exercise extreme vigilance. "Extra effort must be
made in ensuring suitably stringent pre-movement testing safeguards
are in place for animals being imported from susceptible regions," he said.

Vice chairman of the Stormont Agriculture Committee, the UUP's Tom
Elliott, warned: "The nature of this disease is such that once you
have an outbreak, it is difficult to fully eradicate, as conventional
methods of control such as culling and burning are of little use."

The key facts:

What is bluetongue?
Bluetongue is a midge-borne viral disease to which all species of
ruminants are susceptible, although sheep are the most severely
affected. Cattle and goats which appear healthy can carry high virus
levels and provide a source of further infection.

Why is it important?
The virus can cause severe losses in sheep with a significant impact
on livestock keepers and livestock trade. If it is confirmed to be
circulating in Northern Ireland, it would have major economic
significance, as restriction zones would be declared.

How is it transmitted?
Transmission between animals occurs when a midge bites an infected
animal and passes the infection on.

Does bluetongue affect humans?
Bluetongue does not affect humans, so there are no human or public
health implications.

Is there a vaccine?
Vaccination of animals is not allowed unless authorised by the
Department. A vaccine against the strain in Ulster is not expected
until later this year [2008].

[The press-given title of this piece: "Bluetongue hits Ulster," is
misleading. The above and similar items from elsewhere in the UK
(such as the Dutch-origin Texel sheep found positive in Wales; see at
<http://www.dailypost.co.uk/farming-north-wales/farming-news/2008/02/16/bluetongue-sheep-had-tested-negative-55578-20483061/>),
are not "1st BTV-8 cases" in new territories. These animals had been
infected in their original countries a considerable time -- probably
not less than 2 months -- before export. According to the veterinary
certificate requirements, if they tested (serologically) positive
prior to export, they should have been excluded from the
consignments; however, most probably they were not viraemic upon
arrival in Wales or Ulster and thus did not seem to pose a real
threat to the local livestock; they thus do not deserve the
definition "1st case."

As spring approaches and temperatures rise, the risk from such
animals will increase. - Mod.AS]
