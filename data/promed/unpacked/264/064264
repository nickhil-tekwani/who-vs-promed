The CDC says it is investigating an outbreak of gastrointestinal illness on a recently concluded Viking Cruises' voyage. The health agency reported that 114 out of 640 passengers and 4 crew members out of 404 on board the Viking Sea ship reported diarrhea caused by an unknown agent. Those totals do not reflect any symptoms that emerged after disembarkation.

According to iCruise, the transatlantic cruise embarked from Barcelona on 29 Nov [2021] and spent 2 weeks visiting cities in Spain, Portugal, Morocco, and St. Maarten before ending its voyage in San Juan, Puerto Rico, Monday [13 Dec 2021]. As a result of the outbreak, the CDC noted that Viking Cruises has increased cleaning and disinfection protocol according to the ship's "outbreak prevention and response plan" and also collected stool specimens from passengers and crew that have been sent for testing.

The ship sent daily reports of the cases on board to the CDC's Vessel Sanitation Program, which works to "assist the cruise ship industry to prevent and control the introduction, transmission, and spread" of GI illness on cruise ships. The CDC said the VSP is monitoring Viking's outbreak response and sanitation practices.

Viking Sea is currently en route to Barbados on a round trip cruise that departed from San Juan on Monday [13 Dec 2021], according to Cruise Mapper, a site that tracks cruise ship locations.

[With the resumption of cruises (caveat emptor), it is not surprising that outbreaks in the closed environment of transoceanic cruise ships are beginning to occur. COVID-19 and norovirus are the 2 most recognized outbreaks on the ships but, as seen in the See Also list below, many other outbreaks can occur. Although the details in the CDC report above cite _Vibrio_ (likely _V. parahaemolyticus_ from raw shellfish_) and _E. coli_ (likely not the enterohemorrhagic type) as the pathogens involved, both are likely foodborne. - Mod.LL
