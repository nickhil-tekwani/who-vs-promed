A comment regarding "Anthrax, human - UK (05): drum workshop"
-----------------------------------------------
You raise a question that I have been struggling with since last fall
[2008], when we had the 2 cases of cutaneous anthrax in the drum
maker in Connecticut. So far as I can tell, we've only seen 6 of
these drum-related events (7 cases total) in the past 3-plus decades:

1974 with the "bongo drum disease" case ex Haiti;
2001 with the cutaneous case in British Columbia that Les Kumor
mentioned in March 2006 after the NYC drum-maker case;
2006 with said NYC case;
2006 again with the Scottish drummer case;
2007 with the 2 Connecticut cases;
2008 with this last case in Great Britain.

The only one of the inhalation cases that apparently had any
pre-existing conditions which would increase the risk of contracting
inhalation anthrax was the Scottish case, as he had a history of
acute myeloid leukemia, but that was considered to be in remission. I
don't know if he had recently been on any chemotherapy, but he had
his last follow-up visit the month before he became ill. The only
thing that comes to mind is that there may have been a long-term
impact on his cell-mediated immunity, which would have hindered any
macrophage clearance of spores he did inhale.

Neither the NYC case nor this most recent case in GB had any
predisposing condition to speak of: no smoking, COPD, or recent
illness. The NYC case was an incredibly healthy, athletic man. But,
the way they were working (without any respiratory protection) would
make it seem as they would be breathing heavily while they were
working on their drums, and in both cases, there was poor ventilation
in the workspace (a storage facility unit for the NYC case and a
small studio flat for the GB case). The Connecticut case did work in
a shed, but he was wearing a respirator [His 8-year-old son who also
developed a cutaneous lesion never went into his father's workshop;
see report referenced below. - Mod.MHJ].

We are working on updating, yet again, our information that we are
putting out on the CDC website about this, and we have had several
discussions with a focus group with representatives from the
drum-making community (teachers and the like) to find better ways to
get the message about how to safely do this activity out to the
community (such as flyers, podcasts, putting links on the websites
and community boards, etc.). One of the things that they have made
clear is that this kind of activity is definitely increasing in popularity.

So, were these inhalation cases just due to laborious work with
resultant heavy breathing in poorly ventilated areas, and perhaps
most of the drum makers in West Africa work more out in the open? One
of the drum makers interviewed for a BBC article on this said he's
been doing this for 20 years, but he said he always works in the open
and with the wind blowing away from him.

Could this be simply a new variant on the mill-workers syndrome that
we dealt with here in the US, in part by improved industrial hygiene
and ventilation standards?

Is the sudden spike in cases (if 5 can be considered a spike in the
grand scheme of things) due to an increased volume of skins coming
over from West Africa and a lack of appropriate inspection and
certification of them? Perhaps, as the global markets have opened up
over the past several decades, it is now more likely for a small
herder in West Africa to salvage, butcher, and harvest the skin off
of a carcass and bring it to market, when it gets bundled up with the
rest and winds up on a ship to the US or the UK [or other countries?
- Mod.MHJ].

I know these are just thoughts, perhaps random at best, but input on
anything seen as either valid in or missing from these cases, or on
this increase in cases in general, would be greatly appreciated.

[Have any of our members in other countries had contact with African
drum makers? I ask because if imported drum hides are as popular as
it seems that they are, other countries must be at risk. Susan
Baekeland tells me that: "In Kenya, there used to be a big problem
with antelope hides, mainly from Somalia, not tanned properly and
being sold off to tourists. Notices were put up, but people do not
pay attention. South Africa is another country where the hides are
quite often not properly tanned and do not last as a consequence." So
maybe we should consider any sun-dried hide out of Africa as a risk.

Our European colleagues with large African communities, such as
Paris, Lyon, Marsailles, Naples, might want to keep this in mind.

And we should not take our eye off the drum makers' homes. They are
not necessarily "clean" but can be a right mess, as was the case in
Connecticut, apparently. In this event, 18/72 house samples were
positive for _B. anthracis_.
