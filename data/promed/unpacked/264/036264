[This week's report is very sobering. Rather than report on possible interruption of transmission of polioviruses, there have been 5 WPV associated cases and 20 cVDPV associated cases reported during this past week. As of the date of these data (27 Nov 2019) there have now been a total of 112 WPV1 associated cases with dates of onset during 2019. Even more sobering is that as of 27 Nov 2019, there have now been 177 cVDPV associated cases. For the past several years, the number of cVDPV associated paralytic cases has surpassed the number of WPV associated cases. During 2018, there were 33 cases associated with WPV infection compared with 104 cases associated with cVDPV infection. During 2017 there were 22 cases associated with WPV infection compared with 96 cases associated with cVDPV infection. It's not easy for a country to continue to successfully promote vaccination when cases are associated with infection with a VDPV. Are we approaching the time when OPV (live attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine) should be eliminated and only the IPV (inactivated poliovirus vaccine) should be used?

Case reports during the past week have involved 6 countries. Only Pakistan reported WPV associated cases (5 WPV1)) whereas 6 countries reported cVDPV associated cases: Pakistan (2 cVDPV2), DR Congo (5 cVDPV2), Benin (4 cVDPV2), Ghana (4 cVDPV2), Philippines (3 cVDPV2) and Togo (2 cVDPV2).

For a map showing the locations of both WPV-associated cases and cVDPV-associated cases, see http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/.

As done in previous posts, to visualize all of this activity, I am putting links to HealthMap/ProMED-mail maps of countries with poliovirus activity during 2018 and 2019 below. The size of the list remains impressive, now with 23 countries: 16 in Africa, 5 in Asia, and 3 in the Western Pacific, with either WPV or cVDPV isolates in their countries (and in the case of Pakistan, both WPV1 and cVDPV2). An important reminder is that positive environmental samples means that the virus is circulating in the area where the samples have been obtained. Hence, if a susceptible individual is infected with the virus, there is a chance the person may develop paralytic disease.

Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 - Pakistan, 28 Nov 2019
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Through national disease surveillance, an outbreak of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type-2 (cVDPV2) has been confirmed in Pakistan in 2019. Between [7 Jul 2019] and [3 Nov 2019], 11 children have been paralysed from cVDPV2 in Pakistan - 4 in Diamir district, Gilgit-Baltistan province, 3 in Kohistan, 2 in Torghar and 1 in Charsadda, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province, and 1 in Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad. The median age for these cases was 22 months [range 8 to 66 months].

The virus was also isolated in stool samples from 2 contacts of 1 patient from Diamir, 1 contact of 1 patient from Torghar, as well as from 16 healthy children from Diamir, Kohistan and Rawalpindi districts. In addition, the virus was also isolated in 7 environmental samples collected between [21 Aug 2019] and [25 Oct 2019] in Rawalpindi and Lahore districts, Punjab province; Diamir and Gilgit districts, Gilgit-Baltistan province; and Site Town, district West, Karachi, Sindh province.

The genetic sequencing confirmed that the VDPV2 isolated in the environmental samples collected at the Safdarabad site in Rawalpindi district in August [2019] was linked to a virus isolated in Diamir environmental samples collected in August and September [2019]. This is the indication of a circulating VDPV2 outbreak.

All VDPV2 strains were isolated in the WHO Regional Reference Laboratory for Polioviruses (RRL), National Institute of Health in Pakistan and had a full viral genomic sequencing in the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The VDPV2 isolates from acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases, contacts, and environmental samples have undergone 6 to 13 nucleotide changes reflecting a recent emergence of cVDPV2.

Pakistan is classified as endemic for wild poliovirus, and as of [13 Nov 2019], there have been 86 cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) reported in the country in 2019 compared to 12 cases in 2018.

The last VDPV2 case in Pakistan was reported from Quetta city, Balochistan province in December 2016 and was classified as a cVDPV2. Response campaigns were conducted with monovalent oral poliovirus type 2 (mOPV2) where 2.96 million doses were administered. The last response campaign was in March 2017 and this was the last time mOPV2 was used in Pakistan. In the country, inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) was introduced in September 2015 and its reported coverage was suboptimal ranging from 20% in 2015 to 75% in 2018.

Figure 1. Map showing areas affected [available at source url]

Public health response
The outbreak response and detailed field investigations are ongoing to understand both the source of the virus and the extent of transmission. Active surveillance for AFP is being strengthened and environmental surveillance is being intensified and expanded; subnational population immunity levels are being assessed. These investigations have drawn on the experience and capacity of the international poliovirus laboratory network and global experts.

While investigations continue, an inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) campaign was conducted in September 2019 targeting more than 180 000 children between the age of 4-59 months to rapidly increase population immunity . The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) has supported the Ministry of Health (MoH) to implement a vaccination campaign with mOPV2 that commenced on [13 Nov 2019] in 11 districts of northern Pakistan (Haripur, Abbotabad, Mansehra, Battagram, Shangla, Torghar, Kohistan, Charsadda, Mohmand, Diamir, Gilgit), as well as in the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad targeting 2.7 million children under-5 years of age. In affected areas and identified high-risk areas, it is critical to respond robustly and rapidly to outbreaks.

WHO risk assessment
WHO's assessment is that the risk of spread of cVDPV2 within the country as high due to the high population movement, strong connectivity across the country, and low population immunity against type 2 poliovirus. The detection of this cVDPV2 strain underscores the importance of maintaining high levels of routine polio vaccination coverage at all levels to minimize the risk and consequences of any poliovirus circulation. WHO stands ready to support the ongoing investigation and risk assessment by national health authorities.

ProMED-mail rapporteur Marianne Hopp

[Pakistan has now reported 11 confirmed cases of cVDPV2 associated paralytic disease during 2019. These cases have been reported from areas with known WPV1 circulation as well as locations with known suboptimal vaccination coverages but no documented WPV1 infections.

The occurrence of these cVDPV2 cases is challenging to the authorities in the areas as these are a result of a vaccine virus and not the WPV.

Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 - African Region 29 Nov 2019
----
Outbreaks of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) have been reported in several countries in West Africa, central Africa and Horn of Africa (for more information, please see the disease outbreak news published on [31 Jul 2019]). This report provides a situational update on current cVDPV2 outbreaks in newly affected countries in Africa. No wild poliovirus has been detected on the continent since September 2016.

A. West Africa and Lake Chad Basin (LCB) sub-region
In West Africa and the Lake Chad sub-region, a cVDPV2 outbreak originating from Jigawa state, Nigeria, continues to spread. Following detection of this outbreak in Cameroon, Ghana, Benin and the Republic of Niger earlier this year and in 2018, the virus has now been detected in Chad, Togo and CÃ´te d'Ivoire.

Chad
On [16 Oct 2019], cVDPV2 was isolated from a child under 5 years old with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in Mandelia sub-prefecture in Chari Baguirmi province, western Chad bordering Cameroon. Onset of paralysis was on [9 Sep 2019]. The isolated virus was reported to be genetically different from Sabin 2 with 32 nucleotide changes. The affected geographical area has previously not participated in a monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) vaccination campaign.

As of [28 Oct 2019], there is one case of cVDPV2 reported in the country. According to the WHO-UNICEF routine immunization estimates, inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) coverage in children under the age of one was estimated to be 41% in 2018.

Togo
On [15 Oct 2019], cVDPV2 was isolated from a child under 5 years old with AFP in Est-Mono district in Plateaux province, bordering Benin to the east and Ghana to the west, with the onset of paralysis on [13 Sep 2019]. Samples were collected on [18 and 19 Sep 2019]. The isolated virus was genetically different from Sabin 2 by 35 nucleotide changes. The affected geographical area has previously not participated in a mOPV2 vaccination campaign.

This is the 1st-ever reported cVDPV2 outbreak in the country and is genetically linked to the outbreak originating in Jigawa state, Nigeria. As of [28 Oct 2019], there is 1 case of cVDPV2 reported in the country. According to the WHO-UNICEF routine immunization estimates, IPV coverage in children under the age of 1 was estimated to be 20% in 2018 due to the delay in its introduction to the routine immunization schedule in October 2018. The last indigenous wild poliovirus was reported in 1999.

CÃ´te d'Ivoire
1 cVDPV2 positive environmental sample was reported from Adjame-Plateau-Attecoube in Abidjan province. The sample was collected on [26 Sep 2019]. This positive sample is linked to the outbreak in Jigawa state, Nigeria.

B. East and Southern Africa
Zambia
In Zambia, a cVDPV2 was isolated from a child under 5 years old with AFP and onset of paralysis on [16 Jul 2019] from Chiengi in Luapula province, Zambia, bordering Haut Katanga province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). As part of the investigation, 34 samples were collected from close contacts and community members on [24 and 29 Jul 2019] and the isolated virus was genetically different from Sabin 2 by 9 nucleotide changes. 2 of the samples from community contacts tested positive for VDPV2 on [17 Sep 2019]. Gene sequencing confirmed the presence of cVDPV2 in the 2 samples on [17 Oct 2019], with 9 and 10 nucleotide changes and genetic links to the index case. The affected geographical area has previously not participated in a mOPV2 vaccination campaign.

The current cVDPV2 outbreak is the 1st outbreak reported in Zambia. As of [28 Oct 2019], the country has reported 1 cVDPV2 case. IPV was introduced in Zambia in June 2018 due to global supply shortage, and according to the WHO-UNICEF routine immunization estimates, IPV coverage in children under the age of 1 was estimated to be 36% in 2018. The last indigenous wild poliovirus case was reported in 1995.

Furthermore, outbreaks of cVDPV2 were reported in other countries in central Africa and the horn of Africa. These countries include Democratic Republic of the Congo, Central African Republic, Angola, Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya. Additionally, cVDPV2 outbreak has also been reported in Mozambique.

Public health response
Partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) are providing support as required to affected Ministries of Health. Epidemiological and virological field investigations are ongoing to ascertain the source and origin of the isolated viruses; active surveillance is being strengthened; subnational population immunity levels are being assessed; and, preparedness for outbreak response is being conducted. A more detailed public health response by country is summarized below.

A. West Africa and Lake Chad Basin (LCB) sub-region
Chad
Following the confirmation of the cVDPV2 on [16 Oct 2019], the Minister of Health in Chad declared the outbreak a national public health emergency on [19 Oct 2019]. The immediate response campaign was conducted from [2 to 5 Nov 2019] in the district of Mandalea targeting 51 800 children under 5 years old using mOPV2. The 1st round of the polio campaign was conducted from [21 to 25 Nov 2019] and the second round is planned for 5[13 to 17 Dec 2019] covering 12 districts and targeting 789 418 children under five years old.

Togo
Following the confirmation of the cVDPV2 on [15 Oct 2019], the Minister of Health in Togo declared the outbreak a national public health emergency on [25 Oct 2019]. A risk assessment was conducted and presented to the Advisory Group on [23 Oct 2019]. The immediate response campaign using mOPV2 was conducted from [7 to 10 Nov 2019] in 4 districts (Est Mono, Thamba, Anie and Blitta) targeting 132 404 children under 5 years old. The 1st round of the polio campaign was conducted from [21 to 24 Nov 2019] and the 2nd round is planned for [5 to 8 Dec 2019] covering 2 regions (Plateaux and Centrale regions) and 17 districts targeting 513 768 children under 5 years old.

Following the confirmation of the cVDPV2 on [17 Oct 2019], the minister of health in Zambia declared the outbreak a national public health emergency on [18 Oct 2019]. The immediate response campaign using mOPV2 was conducted from [6 to 12 Nov 2019] in the 4 districts of Chienge, Nchelenge, Kaputa and Nsama targeting 141 312 children under 5 years old. The 1st round of the polio campaign is planned for [26 Nov 2019] to [2 Dec 2019] and the 2nd round is planned for [17 to 23 Dec 2019] covering 11 districts and targeting 337 215 children under 5 years old (for each round).

WHO risk assessment
Given cross-border population movements, suboptimal immunity and surveillance gaps, and waning mucosal immunity to type 2 poliovirus, the risk of further spread or emergence of cVDPV2 in Africa remains high. The detection of cVDPV2s underscores the importance of maintaining high routine vaccination coverage everywhere to minimize the risk and consequences of any poliovirus circulation. In affected areas and identified high-risk areas, it is critical that emergency and high-quality outbreak response be fully implemented.

WHO will continue to evaluate the epidemiological situation and outbreak response measures being implemented.

WHO advice
It is important that all countries, in particular, those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for AFP cases in order to rapidly detect any new virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.

WHO's International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than 4 weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of OPV or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) within 4 weeks to 12 months of travel.

As per the advice of an Emergency Committee convened under the International Health Regulations (2005), efforts to limit the international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Countries affected by poliovirus transmission are subject to Temporary Recommendations. To comply with the Temporary Recommendations issued under the PHEIC, any country infected by poliovirus should declare the outbreak as a national public health emergency and consider vaccination of all international travellers.

[The above report has appropriately focused on the reduced coverages with the IPV dose that was aimed at providing protection against a poliovirus type 2 infection after the switchover from using the trivalent OPV (OPV containing all 3 poliovirus serotypes - 1, 2 and 3) to a bivalent OPV (containing only types 1 and types 3 OPVs) that was to have occurred in April 2016.

Since 2018, there have been cVDPV2 outbreaks in: Cameroon, Ghana, Benin, Nigeria, the Republic of Niger, Chad, Togo, CÃ´te d'Ivoire, Zambia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Central African Republic, Angola, Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya and Mozambique. The ongoing outbreak in Nigeria (Jigawa) has spread to Cameroon, Ghana, Benin, Niger, Togo and Cote d'Ivoire.

[4] Afghanistan, Taliban bans polio vaccination - media report
Date: 27 Nov 2019

Health officials in central Uruzgan province said that over 70 per cent of children who need to receive anti-polio vaccination were "disappeared" during vaccination campaign due to Taliban's threats to the organization in the province. The campaign was launched for 3 days aiming for 50 000 children to be vaccinated by provincial public hospital.

Dr Miakhel told Pajwok Afghan News that despite recording of 8 positive polio cases, the Taliban militants have banned anti-polio-vaccination in the areas under their control. 'Over 140 000 children have not received vaccination,' he added. If the Taliban held on ban against the vaccinations he said that dangerous and harmful consequences would be created in the future.

Meanwhile, provincial governor, Asadullah Sayeed has confirmed the issues and called on the Taliban militants to allow the health officials to provide the medical facilities for the Afghan children. 'We ask the tribal elders and Islamic scholars to cooperate with the Afghan government in regards,' he added.

Sayed Rasul, a resident of Gizab distract told Pajwok that 'no vaccination team has so far visited our area'.

[This is not the 1st time that militant Taliban groups have interfered with polio vaccination efforts in Afghanistan. But somewhat surprising as in recent times the Taliban have been permitting vaccination efforts. Oruzgan province is one of the provinces where poliovirus has been circulating and cases have been confirmed.

Vaccination refusal leads to increased polio cases in Torghar: DHO
------------------------------------------------------------------
District health officer (DHO) Torghar Dr Iftikhar Ahmed said that unawareness on part of parents in Torghar is the main reason behind vaccination refusal that resulted in increased number of polio cases. Talking to media, he said that number of polio refusal cases in the district Torghar is the major cause of increased polio victims. He said that most parents are unaware of the benefits of polio vaccination and avoid immunization of their children.

Dr Iftikhar Ahmed stated that the results of 5- day long drive were inspiring and added it is expected that we would achieve 100 per cent target of anti-polio campaigns. He said that most parents are the victim of negative propaganda and are also unaware of the vaccination benefits.

Health workers survive NPA ambush in Agusan
-------------------------------------------
Health workers implementing the "Sabayang Patak Kontra Polio" (mass polio vaccination) were ambushed by heavily armed men believed to be members of the New People's Army in Kalipayan, Zapanta Valley, Kitcharao, Agusan del Norte, Wednesday, police reported yesterday [28 Nov 2019]. No one was reported hurt when the vehicle of the health workers of the Kitcharao Municipal Health Office was peppered with bullets by the attackers.

The health workers, [a 46 year old head nurse; a 28 year old midwife], and their companions on board a dark gray Toyota Innova were in a convoy with another multicab also carrying barangay health workers on their way back to their office when the ambush took place at 2 pm.[They] managed to drive the vehicle to a safer place after the attackers fired shots at its windshield.

The health workers have been conducting mass oral polio vaccination in the area, police said. Dr Jose R Llacuna jr, director of the Department of Health Region 13, said the anti-polio vaccination program in Caraga region "will go on without let-up. This incident will not deter our program and will go on until we achieved our goal," said Llacuna who immediately went to Kitcharao to personally check the situation of the health workers. He instructed all health workers in far-flung areas to "take extra precautionary measures" to avoid being harmed by lawless elements.

DoH 13 spokesperson Romelyn Esther C Torralba said 226 474 children benefited from the oral polio vaccination program. It represents 69 per cent accomplishment in 2 days after the Sabayang Patak Kontra Polio was officially launched last Monday [25 Nov 2019]. The all-out oral polio vaccination is the government's direct response to the outbreak of polio in the country this year [2019].

[This is the 1st report of violence against polio vaccination teams in the Philippines. The involved area is in MIndinao. While there haven't been polio cases reported from Kitcharao municipality, the Mindinao region has been where the cVDPV2 activity has been occurring in the Philippines. This doesn't bode well for the ongoing olio vaccination efforts in the region.
