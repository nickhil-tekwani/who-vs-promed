Death Toll in Outbreak of Undiagnosed Fever Rises to 32
-------------------------------------------------------
SILIGURI: The toll in the lethal fever which has raged here for the past
fortnight rose to 32 on Sat 24 Feb 2001, with 6 more deaths reported and the
disease spreading to Uttar Dinajpur. A Kolkata doctor claimed that he had
diagnosed it as 'encephalomyelitis'.
A woman patient died at the North Bengal Medical College and Hospital
(NBMCH), during the day, while 4 deaths were reported from Uttar Dinajpur,
and a cardiologist at a Siliguri nursing home, Dr A K Maity, admitted to a
private hospital in Kolkata on Tue 20 Feb 2001 also died. The death at the
NBMCH was confirmed by Urban Development Minister Ashok Bhattacharya, who is
monitoring the situation here. The Assistant Chief Medical Officer of Uttar
Dinajpur, Dr Animesh Roy, stated that 4 persons, including a 2-year old
infant and a woman, were among 4 who died of the fever on Friday night at
Dhiragach and Kaliaganj villages.
Meanwhile in Kolkata, Dr Ashish Kumar of the Calcutta Medical Research
Institute (CMRI), who had attended on the Siliguri cardiologist, stated that
the fever was diagnosed by him as an encephalomyelitis characterized by
concurrent inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. The cardiologist, Dr.
Maity, who had treated patients suffering from the fever in Siliguri before
catching it himself, died after 5 days of a "serious illness", Kumar said.
Dr J C Gandhi, leader of the Ahmedabad team of specialists, however, said
the killer disease "would take one week more to be diagnosed". Gandhi, along
with experts of the National Institute of Communicable Disease, National
Institute of Virology and WHO, told a news conference, "probably the disease
is a viral infection, but we are not ruling out the possibility of other
disease." Gandhi said blood and other samples collected from the affected
persons would be sent to the NIV, Pune and NICD, New Delhi on Monday and the
results were expected by the next weekend. Whatever the nature of the
disease, he said, all doctors, nursing staff and relatives of a patient
should take every protective measure. He asked the people and journalists in
particular not to visit a hospital where fever patients were being treated
to avoid unnecessary risks. "Otherwise there is no reason to panic." He
pointed out that use of masks and antibiotic medicines by the people of the
city were of not much use as the disease "appears to be localized". The
investigation could have been easier, Gandhi said, if post mortems, which
started from Friday, had been carried out properly.

Background Information Relating to the Mystery Fever in North Bengal
--------------------------------------------------------------------
One of the differentials being considered is _Legionella_ infection. But, I
would think that it's too early to hazard a guess. Initial samples sent to
Calcutta were not stored under optimum conditions. It seems though that they
have now identified the index case. What seems most interesting is the
cluster of cases in one particular nursing home in the city, which has since
been closed. Nursing home, in our context, usually means a small private
hospital. Given the choice, people prefer getting treatment through such an
individual private health care option.
The death toll by Sat 24 Feb 2001 has reached 24. One death at the local
hospital due to "pneumonia" was 'mistakenly' included in the count, as per
the official report. The local authorities have decided to close schools for
4 days in order to disinfect the premises. In total, 37 people are
undergoing treatment at the local Medical College Hospital. Some cases
(fever, headache and semiconscious state) have been reported from adjoining
districts which are yet to be confirmed. Interestingly, the city (Siliguri)
is situated on the foothills of the Himalayas, in the northern part of West
Bengal state and is the most important commercial centre of that region --
many people (and students) from Sikkim, Bhutan , the North-Eastern Indian
states, adjoining part of Eastern Nepal and the hills come to this town to
trade or work or study.

[Dr. Chatterjee's comments help to put the situation in context. The press
report suggests that there may have been excessive delay in the referral of
diagnostic samples to central laboratories. It may be another week before
there is an identification of the causative agent. - Mod.CP
