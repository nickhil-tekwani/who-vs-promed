Update 12, <http://www.who.int/emc/outbreak_news/n2000/march/31mar2000.html>

Final confirmation of Marburg infection has been received from the National
Institute for Virology, (NIV), South Africa, in 4 of the 6 patients on whom
we reported on 21 March (see Update 11). Samples from 3 patients had been
confirmed positive by virological tests at that time; positive results are
now confirmed on 1 additional sample. The remaining 2 samples were negative
after extensive tests. These confirmations yield a revised total of 16
cases since November 1999.
Twelve have had the diagnosis confirmed by virological tests and 4 are
classified as suspect cases as no clinical samples were available. Disease
activity is still continuing in the area, and further notifications are
being received. Clinical samples are en route to NIV for investigation.
Enhanced prevention and control measures are being implemented by Ministry
of Health, Democratic Republic of Congo, WHO and Médecins sans Frontières
(Holland).
