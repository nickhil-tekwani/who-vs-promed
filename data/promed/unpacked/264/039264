More than 50 cases of measles have now been seen in Bradford since the end of March 2018.

Now, people in the district are being encouraged to check whether they and their children have had 2 doses of measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine before summer travel.

Public Health England (PHE) is warning the figure could rise even further and is working with Bradford Council and the NHS to make sure anyone across the city who needs an MMR vaccine is aware.

Dr Suzanne Coles, Consultant in Health Protection with PHE Yorkshire and the Humber, said: "We know that right now across Bradford, many families will be making arrangements for summer travel or events, and we're urging families to put MMR vaccination at the top of their checklist. Many families will be planning to holiday in parts of Europe where there are large ongoing measles outbreaks or travel to other countries where measles vaccination coverage is low and where measles is endemic. Anyone who isn't fully vaccinated against the disease is at risk of the highly infectious virus.

"The free vaccine is offered at 1 year of age and as a pre-school booster at 3 years 4 months of age. Regardless of your summer plans, if children and young adults have missed these vaccinations in the past, it's important to take up the vaccine now from GPs. ...

The measles outbreak in England shows no signs of slowing as cases have shot up by [one third], official figures reveal.

Public Health England today [12 Jun 2018] confirmed 587 people have caught the deadly infection already this year [2018], with an extra 147 recorded in 3 weeks.

The figures come as health officials have repeatedly urged parents to ensure their children are up-to-date with the MMR vaccine.

Travel to Europe has been blamed for the ongoing outbreak of measles, which was last year [2017] thought to have been eliminated in the UK.

France, Germany, Greece, Italy and Romania are all currently battling outbreaks of the infection, which can prove fatal in one in 15 cases. ...

Public Health England revealed 440 people had been infected up to 9 May 2018, but a further 147 were diagnosed by the end of the month.

The most cases have been reported in London, where PHE says there have been 213 people diagnosed.

This region was followed by the South East with 128, West Midlands with 81, South West with 62 and Yorkshire and Humberside with 53. ...

To prevent a measles outbreak, it is recommended that 95 per cent of the population be immunised against the infection. Only 91.9 per cent of children were vaccinated against measles between 2015 and 2016 compared to 94.2 per cent in 2014-2015, according to NHS statistics.

Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at PHE, said: "The measles outbreaks we are currently seeing in England are linked to ongoing large outbreaks in Europe. The majority of cases we are seeing are in teenagers and young adults who missed out on their MMR vaccine when they were children." ...

The elimination of measles has been achieved in the UK, global health leaders said in September 2017.

The elimination of measles or rubella can be verified once a country has sustained interruption of endemic transmission for at least 36 months, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

The European Regional Verification Commission said the UK achieved elimination status for measles as of 2016.

Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at Public Health England, said: "We are delighted that the WHO has confirmed that the UK achieved measles elimination in 2016 and that rubella elimination continues to be sustained. In addition, national vaccine coverage of the 1st MMR dose in 5-year-olds has hit the WHO's 95 per cent target. This is a huge achievement and a testament to all the hard work by our health professionals in the NHS to ensure that all children and adults are fully protected with 2 doses of the MMR vaccine. We need to ensure that this is sustained going forward by maintaining and improving coverage of the MMR vaccine in children and by catching up older children and young adults who missed out."

An extra warning has been issued to football fans travelling to Russia for the World Cup, which begins on Thu [14 Jun 2018], where people from all over the world will be gathering. French and German football fans could be among those heading to the World Cup.

PHE tweeted earlier in June 2018: "We're advising fans heading to Russia for the World Cup to ensure they are up to date with their MMR vaccine because of measles outbreaks across the continent."

Measles was declared eliminated in the UK last September 2017 by global health leaders, meaning there had not been a widespread outbreak for 3 years.

But a drop in the number of children being vaccinated could be contributing to the spread of the infection. ...

In Brazil, there is an ongoing measles outbreak. From 1 Jan through 23 May 2018, there were 995 reported cases (Amazonas State-611, and Roraima State-384). Of these cases, 114 have been laboratory confirmed (30 in Amazonas and 84 in Roraima), including 2 deaths. 83 cases were discarded, and 798 remain under investigation.

In Amazonas State, 611 suspected cases were reported from 1 Jan through 23 May 2018, of which 30 were confirmed, 63 discarded and 518 are under investigation. In Roraima State, 384 suspected cases were reported, of which 84 were confirmed, 20 discarded and 280 are under investigation. Of the 84 confirmed cases, 58 are among Venezuelans (69 percent), 24 Brazilians (28.6 percent), one from Guiana (1.2 percent) and 1 Argentinian (1.2 percent). Of all confirmed cases, 34 are indigenous. Two measles deaths were among Venezuelans from Boa Vista municipality.

The rash onset dates of the confirmed cases in both states were from 4 Feb through 2 Apr 2018. Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz/RJ) conducted an analysis, where they identified the genotype as D8 for all laboratory confirmed cases, which is identical to the 2017 Venezuela outbreak.

Public health response
------------------------
Actions implemented include:
- Roraima and Amazonas states have started a vaccination campaign that targets 6-month-old infants through 49-year-old age groups.
- Intensified epidemiological surveillance through active and retrospective institutional case finding, contact tracing, and monitoring of contacts has been implemented.
- A strengthened laboratory network
- A risk communication strategy has been implemented.
- Training of health care workers in case management.

WHO risk assessment
-----------------
... Case management includes vitamin A administration and antipyretics, and antibiotic and anti-diarrheal medications as needed. Among malnourished children and people with greater susceptibility, measles can cause serious complications, including blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhea, ear infection, and pneumonia. Measles can be prevented by immunization. In countries with low vaccination coverage, epidemics typically occur every 2-3 years and usually last between 2-3 months, although their duration varies according to population size, crowding, and the population's immunity status.

The Region of the Americas was declared free of measles in September 2016; nevertheless, outbreaks caused by imported cases from other regions may occur sporadically.

The risk of spread at the national level in Brazil remains high due to the epidemiological situation and the high potential of transmission. The main challenges are vaccination coverage among immigrants and laboratory diagnostic capacity in local facilities. Because of ongoing transmission, vaccination strategies and other actions are being implemented to control the outbreak by local and federal authorities in Brazil. At the regional level, the potential impact is considered high given the performance of routine immunization programmes and prevention and control capacities in other countries in the Region.

WHO advice
-------------
On 1 Sep 2017, the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) shared information on this outbreak with its Member States and alerted them regarding the risk of outbreaks occurring from imported measles cases, as well as the possibility of re-introduction of the disease in areas with low vaccination coverage. In light of continuous reports of imported measles cases from other regions and ongoing outbreaks in the Americas, PAHO/WHO urges all Member States to:

Vaccinate to maintain coverage of 95 percent with the 1st and 2nd doses of measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine. Vaccinate at-risk populations (without proof of vaccination or immunity against measles and rubella), such as health workers, people working in tourism and transportation (hotel and catering, airports, taxi drivers, etc.), and international travelers. Maintain a reserve of measles-rubella (MR) vaccine and syringes for control of imported cases in each country in the Region.

Strengthen epidemiological surveillance of measles for timely detection of all suspected cases of measles in public and private healthcare facilities and ensure that samples are received by laboratories within 5 days of being taken.

Provide a rapid response to imported measles cases through the activation of rapid response teams to prevent the re-establishment of endemic transmission. Once a rapid response team has been activated, continued coordination between the national and local levels must be ensured, with permanent and fluid communication channels between all levels (national, sub-national, and local).

[6] Sierra Leone

The Ministry of Health and Sanitation today [14 Jun 2018] declared a measles outbreak in Falaba district in the remote northern part of Sierra Leone.

There has been a total of 19 confirmed cases this week in the Chiefdoms of Sulima (14 cases) and Mongo (5 cases), close to the border with Guinea.

A measles outbreak is defined as 3 or more laboratory confirmed cases in a community or district in 1 month.

"We are doing everything in our power to bring this outbreak under control, with teams already on the ground leading the response," said Dr. Brima Kargbo, Chief Medical Officer at the Ministry of Health and Sanitation. "Given the location of the affected communities, we are working with our counterparts in Guinea to ensure continued collaboration on measles vaccination efforts, community engagement and surveillance."

"While we are planning an emergency vaccination campaign within Koinadugu, we want to encourage all caregivers everywhere in the country to ensure children aged under 2 years have received their 2 doses of the measles [vaccine], which provides lasting protection against the disease," said Dr. Kargbo. "Vaccination is the only reliable way to ensure your child is protected against this life-threatening illness, which can be devastating in its effects."

With support from WHO, MSF, UNICEF, UK Aid and other partners, the response to the recent cases will include a targeted vaccination campaign for children in affected and most at-risk areas in Koinadugu district, cross-border collaboration and community engagement, contact-tracing and enhanced surveillance for suspected measles cases. Parents and caregivers are also being reminded to ensure their children's routine vaccines are up to date.

"Across the country, vaccination uptake has recovered following the Ebola outbreak," said Dr. Kargbo. "However, there are still areas where vaccination coverage is sub-optimal, especially in communities that are very remote and where populations are mobile and travelling across borders. This will require concerted efforts not only from our health workers but also caregivers, communities, local authorities and health partners to ensure that every child, everywhere is reached with their necessary vaccines."

The Koinadugu vaccine campaign is expected to start within the next 2 weeks.

This is a press release from the Ministry of Health and Sanitation and WHO.
