Ebola: 200 Norwegian health workers to West Africa
--------------------------------------------------
Health Minister Bent Hoie has announced that Norway is sending 200 health workers to West Africa to join the fight against the Ebola epidemic. The Health Department had initially asked for 60 volunteers, but more than 300 signed up. The Health Minister says Norway has signed an agreement with Great Britain, and the Norwegian health workers will be working at a British center for Ebola victims in Sierra Leone. Norway already last week sent an advanced team to the area, to prepare for logistics, security and other facilities for the Norwegian health workers. In addition, 6 Norwegian doctors are already in Sierra Leone and Liberia, working for Doctors without Borders ... -- more

[2] Sierra Leone: UK sets up 3 new Ebola Labs

UK sets up 3 new Ebola Labs in Sierra Leone
-------------------------------------------
The UK Government has pledged new funds of GBP 20 million [about USD 32 million] to build, run and staff the labs, which will be used to test blood samples and swabs for the virus. They will also be used to give the all-clear for Ebola patients who survive the disease.... The 1st laboratory opened in Kerry Town last week [October 2014] next to a UK-funded Ebola treatment centre, doubling the country's testing capacity; 2 more are being built at UK treatment centres in Port Loko and Makeni under the direction of UK Royal Engineers, Public Health England (PHE) and the Department for International Development (DFID). Once operational, the labs will quadruple the number of tests that can be conducted every day and reduce waiting times for results from 5 days to 24 hours. International Development Secretary, Justine Greening said: "Tackling Ebola at the source is key to beating it and stopping the spread...."

The Africa Governance Initiative (AGI) recently found that the Ebola virus is spreading 9 times faster than it was 2 months ago in some rural parts of Sierra Leone. The virus is also increasing in the capital, Freetown, which is recording 6 times more cases per day than it was 2 months ago. In Liberia, however, the rate of new cases appears to have slowed.

So far, the UK has dedicated a total of GBP 225 million [about USD 360 million] to beating Ebola, including the provision of 700 Ebola treatment beds which will provide direct medical care for up to 8800 patients over 6 months. Around 50 volunteers from the NHS [National Health Service], PHE, universities and the Defence Science & Technology Laboratory will arrive in Sierra Leone in the coming weeks to form the lab technician team. A further 800 Ministry of Defence personnel are expected to be deployed to the country to help with the establishment of Ebola treatment centres and an Ebola training academy ... -- more

[3] Sierra Leone: Ebola age-related case fatality rates

Ebola age-related case fatality rate; under 21s have the best chance of survival
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Ebola virus is more likely to claim the lives of those aged 45 or older, scientists have claimed. A new study carried out in Sierra Leone -- one of the West African nations worst hit during the outbreak -- has produced a picture of how the virus affects sufferers. A study carried out by health workers and scientists at Sierra Leone's Kenema Government Hospital, has found the younger a patient, the more likely [s/he is] to survive. The fatality rate for patients under age 21 was 57 percent, while for those aged 45 and older, case fatality was 94 percent. 47 doctors and nurses collated the information while caring for 106 patients at Kenema Government Hospital in Sierra Leone -- one of the nations hardest hit by the Ebola outbreak. Fever was the most common symptom when victims 1st sought care, which was when early medical help is crucial.

Fever was the most common symptom reported by over 80 percent of those admitted. The higher the temperature recorded on admission to hospital, the more likely patients were to die from Ebola. One striking finding was how devastating the severe diarrhoea, a symptom of the disease, is for patients. 'If you can keep up with simple hydration during that phase, you can improve survival rate,' Dr. Bruce Farber, chief of infectious diseases at North Shore University Hospital, New York, told CBS News. Basic supportive health care, providing intravenous fluids and nutrients, and maintaining a patient's blood pressure can be the difference between life and death.

For the last 10 years at the Kenema Government Hospital in Sierra Leone, a team of US scientists has been working with staff and the country's health department to establish a new medical records system. It was introduced to help deal with patients suffering Lassa fever. When the Ebola outbreak reached Sierra Leone's 3rd largest city in May [2014], the system in place began to collate a comprehensive set of data on the disease from Ebola virus. The findings, published this week in the New England Journal of Medicine* [see ref. below], have added to knowledge of the disease.

47 doctors and nurses collated the information while caring for 106 patients at Kenema Government Hospital in Sierra Leone. 7 of the health workers conducting the research died -- 6 from Ebola, while one suffered a stroke. Among them was Dr Sheik Humarr Khan, the doctor hailed a hero by his government, having led Sierra Leone's fight against the virus until his death in July [2014].
