Four residents of Florida died from a mosquito-borne disease that
usually affects horses, health officials reported Tuesday [17 Aug
2010], while the swampy state enters its high season of diseases
originating in these insects [mosquitoes].

Health officials said last month [July 2010] that 2 residents in the
Tampa area had died from eastern equine encephalitis [EEE], a viral
disease that inflames the brain. Since then, 2 additional deaths from
the disease known as EEE have been confirmed, one in Tallahassee, the
state capital, and another in the town of Sopchoppy, in northwestern Florida.

EEE affects mostly unvaccinated horses, and there are some human
deaths each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC).

There is no vaccine for humans against the disease, which kills 1/3rd
of its human victims and often leaves survivors with significant brain damage.

EEE and West Nile virus have been detected in 43 of the 67 counties
in Florida, according to the Department of Health.

State health officials urged residents today [17 Aug 2010] to avoid
contact with mosquitoes by using protective clothing and using insect
repellent. They also asked property owners to remove stagnant water
where mosquitoes breed.

[A previous report published in Tampa Bay.com
(<http://www.tampabay.com/news/health/article1111876.ece>) on 30 Jul
2010 indicated incorrectly that there were 3 previous cases of human
EEE in Florida. The Florida Department of Health
(<http://www.doh.state.fl.us/>) statistics confirm the above MDZ
report indicating that the current fatal cases were the 3rd and 4th
in the state.

This state is endemic for EEE virus. There have been a number of
equine cases of EEE virus infection this year (2010) in the state.
There is no vaccine available for human use, although EEE
vaccinations are available and recommended for equine animals.
