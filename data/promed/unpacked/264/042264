[Given the occurrence of many confirmed cases of H7N9 avian influenza in both humans and animals in China, it would be interesting to know from which provinces/locations these birds were imported.

A map showing the outbreaks of LPAI in the Asia region can be obtained from http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/Diseaseoutbreakmaps
(Note: to view the information on LPAI, scroll down to the name of the disease, time period, and zoom in over the Asian region).

Silky fowl is a breed of chicken named for its atypically fluffy plumage, which is said to feel like silk. The breed has several other unusual qualities, such as black skin, flesh, and bones, blue earlobes, and 5 toes on each foot, whereas most chickens have only 4. They are often exhibited in poultry shows, and appear in various colors (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silkie).
