Strange Disease Attacks Malawi's Chiradzulu District
----------------------------------------------------
Doctors at Chiradzulu Hospital in the southern Malawi district of
Chiradzulu are battling a strange disease which has so far attacked at
least 4 girls.
According to the district medical officer, Charles Kachale, the first case
was brought to the hospital on Sunday. He said the girls brought to the
hospital had paralysis in both legs and had lost speech.
Kachale said that initially medical officials thought the girls had
cerebral malaria or high blood pressure but tests for the 2 conditions
proved negative. Kachale said 2 of the girls were admitted at the hospital
while one was referred to Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital for further
tests. Parents of the last patient opted to take her home for traditional
medicine.
Kachale said doctors are puzzled because normally in a paralysis
situation only one side of the body is affected. He also said all the girls
so far affected were checked to see whether their vocal cords were
affected but found that they were all right. He said that samples of blood
extracted from the girls have been sent to ministry of health headquarters
in Lilongwe, for further tests.
Meanwhile, both girls admitted at Chiradzulu District Hospital have been
discharged, although they are still paralysed and still cannot talk. Deputy
health minister Phillip Bwanali told PANA Wednesday night that experts were
still investigating the cause of the unusual disease.

[There's minimal information here to make a definitive diagnosis -- 4 cases
of lower limb paralysis with questionable vocal cord paralysis. A cluster
of paralysis in school aged children in Africa has one think of polio first
-- reported outbreaks of Guillan Barre Syndrome (GBS) in the past have
turned out to be polio, where physicians assume it can't be polio because
of the high vaccination coverages. For the differential diagnosis it would
help to have more info on the clinical syndrome -- fever, sensory deficits,
if the aphonia or dysphonia was felt to be neurologic vs. local irritation
(laryngeal nerve paralysis vs. laryngitis), if the paralysis was truly
symmetrical or not, and if the paralysis was flaccid vs. spastic -- the
former more consistent with polio and GBS, the latter with some toxin
ingestion. There's also the possibility of another non-polio enterovirus.
Another infectious process that can give this picture is diphtheria, but
there is no mention of the pharyngeal pseudomembrane seen with diphtheria.
