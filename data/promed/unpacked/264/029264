Suspected First Hungarian Case of Meningitis
------------------------------------------
It is yet [too early] to confirm or deny news that a boy, treated in the
Children's Hospital in Budapest, suffered from the meningitis
epidemic which spread recently in Romania, Zoltan Gyimesi, a
doctor at the hospital's intensive care [unit] told MTI on Tuesday.
MTI contacted the hospital following press reports on Tuesday
saying that the first Hungarian victim of the meningitis epidemic
which "rages in Romania" had been treated there.
Gyimesi said that a teenager boy, who had been in Romania
before, was treated 2 weeks ago in the hospital. However, this
disease is not very rare and it is only possible to find out where the
boy caught it after results of a test currently made at the National
Public Health Institute are known.
The boy was treated in the hospital for 10 days, and his illness had
a mild form, involving headache and fever. He received basically
symptomatic treatment.
Gyimesi added that the symptoms make it likely that the illness had
been caused by an epidemic because bacterial meningitis usually
has more severe symptoms.

attempt basic bacterial culture - Mod.JW]
