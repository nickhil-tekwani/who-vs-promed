Henry Musitwa was a prominent banana farmer in Bulyanti until the end of
January this year when he lost his plantation to a strange banana disease.
"The bananas yellowed when they were still very young and the leaves would
yellow and fall," explains Musitwa.
His neighbours had the same problem. They thought that by cutting down the
affected plants, they would solve the problem. This was not the case. ...
More than 30 other farmers faced the same fate.
Dr. Wilberforce Tushemereirwe, programme leader, National Banana Research
programme in Kawanda Agricultural Research Institute identified the disease
as banana wilt [caused by the bacterium _Xanthomonas campestris_ pv.
_musacearum_ (Xpm)]. The identification was subsequently confirmed by
scientists [at] CAB International, UK.
Margaret Nakyanzi, a researcher at Kawanda says that when one plant in the
garden is infected by the bacterial wilt, all the other plants are
infected. The disease is spread through [infected] planting material [and
by wind-borne rain droplets containing the bacterium].
Kawanda is working with the Crop Protection Department in the Ministry of
Agriculture and with local agricultural officers in Kayunga to [eradicate
the disease].
Dr. Israel Kibirige Sebunya, the Minister of State for Agriculture, says
government allocated sh200m [ca. USD 111 600] to Kayunga and Mukono
districts in June, to fight the banana wilt. ... His ministry imposed a
quarantine on the exportation of matooke from Kayunga in February. "The
sh200m was to procure cassava stems, potato [vines], cocoa and clonal
coffee seedlings for the affected farmers," says Sebunya. But, of the 30
farmers in Bulyanti village who have resorted to potato and cassava
farming, none seem to have benefited from these funds.
A roadblock at Sezibwa on the Kampala-Kayunga road was established [in
order to prevent movement of infected material].
[Disease] ... symptoms include yellowing, wilting, and premature ripening
in young plants. [A pinkish-purple colouration of the cut fingers of the
matooke] confirms the presence of the disease.

[Banana wilt arose in Mukono District in October 2001 and continues to
spread in the district. Infected planting material is often planted at
multiple locations, which results in wider spread of the pathogen.
_Fusarium oxysporum_ f. sp. _cubense_ is also involved as a wilt pathogen
of banana. - Mod.DH]
