University fined over researcher's death
The Labor Department fined an Emory University research center $105,000
Monday for safety violations in the death of a researcher who was
splashed in the eye and became infected with a monkey virus. University
officials said they would fight the fine, which was proposed after the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration cited Emory's Yerkes
Regional Primate Research Center for 10 violations of federal workplace
rules in the December death of Elizabeth Griffin, 22. "This tragic
situation reminds us once again how important basic safeguards are in
protecting the health and safety of workers," Labor Secretary Alexis
Herman said in a statement. "A face shield or protective goggles could
have saved a woman's life."
Griffin was helping move a caged Rhesus monkey Oct. 29 when a liquid
from the animal splashed into her eye. She contracted the herpes B virus
and died less than two months later. Griffin was wearing a lab coat,
gloves and a mask but no eye protection. The university said in a
statement that it "not only conformed to all the current standards of
safety and protection at the time of the incident" but was "an active
participant in creating those standards."
