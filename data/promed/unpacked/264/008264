Author summary
--------------
_Bacillus cereus_ biovar _anthracis_ (Bcbva) is an emergent pathogen causing anthrax in West and Central African countries. It shares multiple bacteriological and genomic characteristics with _Bacillus anthracis_, the gram-positive bacterium causing anthrax in mammals worldwide. However, Bcbva has been isolated only in tropical humid forested environments in Africa; thus, we attempted to characterize its potential distribution and the differences with _B. anthracis_ using an ecological niche modeling framework. According to our results, both pathogens are using different environments, and their distribution looks complementary with _B. anthracis_ occupying savanna-like environments and Bcbva occupying forested areas; further, we detected some level of overlap between the potential geographic distributions of _B. anthracis_ and Bcbva, despite their lack of overlap in their current environmental space. This is the 1st time the potential distribution of Bcbva is addressed considering all the available spatial information on the pathogen occurrence available as of 2017. Although our Bcbva models are limited due to sample size, this exploration informs on areas that would likely be considered for further investigation of Bcbva outbreaks with special emphasis on areas where Bcbva and _B. anthracis_ could co-exist.

[For those interested in niche modeling, this is a very interesting and instructive article. And for those just interested in anthrax in whatever host in Africa, it is an eye-opener and a valuable definer of where the major risks are and are not. As the authors point out, we are still at the beginning of modeling the possible habitats for these 2 pathogens, _Bacillus anthracis_ and _Bacillus cereus_ biovar _anthracis_. But these models open the door to new research and outbreak investigations. - Mod.MHJ
