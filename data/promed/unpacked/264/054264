At least 20 residents of Malakajaya subdistrict in Duren Sawit district, East Jakarta, were infected with the mosquito-borne chikungunya virus over the last 6 weeks.

Head of the subdistrict's community unit 03, Andang Subaryono, said the 1st patient was reported in the 1st week of July [2013]. Many of the afflicted were children.

"We have asked our neighborhood to be fumigated, but some neighborhood units have yet to undertake this," he was quoted as saying by beritajakarta.com on Sunday [18 Aug 2013].

Chikungunya virus is spread by the bite of an infected mosquito, and chikungunya fever cases are sometimes misdiagnosed as dengue. The fever can last from a few days to a few weeks [the fever does not last for weeks, but the arthralgia can last for weeks or even months. - Mod.TY]

Head of communicable disease control with East Jakarta health office, Gagah Daru Setiawan, said his office would survey the area in the fight against the spread of chikungunya [virus infections]. "We can fumigate the area or start a community-based program to promote the cleaning of their own neighborhood for effective prevention," he said.

[It is curious that this report does not mention a 7 May 2013 report that in East Jakarta, based on the local Health Sub Department, there were 165 individuals who had chikungunya virus infection. Within the past 7 months in Indonesia, there have been cases of chikungunya virus infection in Bali, West Sumatra, Central Java, and West Java. The local cleanup initiative to eliminate vector mosquito breeding sites would be desirable, and more effective than fumigation over the long-term.
