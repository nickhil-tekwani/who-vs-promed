Foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] broke out in Naran soum [district] in Sukhbaatar Province in early February [2014] and has already spread to 9 soums in 3 neighboring provinces. As of Monday [17 Feb 2014], 1218 out of 1309 infected livestock have been slaughtered.

Remote districts of Ulaanbaatar including Baganuur, Bagakhangai, Nalaikh, Bayanzurkh, Khan-Uul, and Songinokhairkhan are being monitored to prevent FMD spreading to Ulaanbaatar.

Livestock and livestock derivative raw materials such as hide, leather, wool, and cashmere shipments from provinces were prohibited from entering Ulaanbaatar. No livestock product based events such as exhibitions, fairs or competitions will be held in the city until the disease has been completely eliminated, according to a new decree by the Ulaanbaatar Mayor.

Livestock in the city will be vaccinated once vaccine reserve is enough, reported the Ulaanbaatar City Special Commission.

The government issued a resolution to prevent the spread of the current FMD outbreak in 2 eastern provinces and one province in the Gobi.

Officials initially reported that the estimated budget to stop and control the infectious disease in Sukhbaatar Province would be over 900 million MNT [about USD 519 500]. But so far, 4 billion MNT [about USD 2.3 million] from the state budget has already been spent only on vaccines and cleanings.

Six neighboring high-risk provinces have 4.9 million livestock requiring vaccination. At least twice the originally estimated number of livestock vaccines, cleaning substances, needles, test tubes, and syringes will be required. Since 27 Jan 2014, when the FMD was 1st reported, 846 emergency workers have been working on control and management. Additional funding for the provinces dedicated to inspecting livestock, maintaining the quarantines and culling infected livestock are required. The financial impact also includes the salaries of emergency workers and damages to herders.

This kind of FMD can spread within a very short time across vast territory and from country to country. Domestic pets and wild animals are also susceptible to infection.

A bus service between Sainshand and Zamyn-Uud in Dornogovi Province was scheduled to [be] launched on [Mon 17 Feb 2014] but was postponed due to FMD in Sainshand soum. The soum is currently under quarantine and vehicles are prohibited in the area. The rescheduling hasn't been announced yet. The bus service will expand its route and operate between Ulaanbaatar and Sainshand in the future. Preparation work is currently underway.

Interview
---------
The following is an interview with T Baatar, physician of Veterinary and Animal Breeding Agency in Ulaanbaatar, about vaccine reserve, how far the disease has spread, and compensation for slaughtered livestock.

Q. How much compensation will be provided to herders per livestock slaughtered due to FMD? When do you think the compensations will be given?
A. The Elimination [culling] Commission is registering age and sex of livestock before eliminating. According to concerning laws, soum governors will evaluate the total financial loss of each herder and the state will compensate 90 percent of the evaluated loss amount. Quarantine will stop 21 days after the slaughter of the last infected livestock and the state will compensate within 30 days after the quarantine is stopped.
Q. Local news agencies have been reporting shortage of vaccine against FMD. Has Mongolia purchased more vaccines from abroad yet? What is the situation with the current vaccine reserve?
A. We are using vaccines made in Russia. We have vaccines for [1.5 million] livestock right now.
Q. Is it not possible to domestically produce vaccines against FMD?
A. Bio-Combination state agency does not produce vaccines against the disease. Manufacturing this vaccine is very risky. Mongolia is not yet able to produce the vaccine against FMD as it requires advanced technologies. Storing the FMD virus and experimenting after the production must be done in fully prepared condition with the highest level of safety.
Q. Why do you think that the eastern region provinces were infected with the disease? Did FMD virus, which were eliminated a few years ago in Mongolia, recur? What are the possible causes of the disease outbreak?
A. We haven't yet confirmed the origin of the diseases, outbreak date, and genetic similarity of the virus compared to other viruses. Therefore, we have sent a virus sample to the World [Reference Laboratory] in England and another laboratory in Russia. The results will be available in a month [see comment below]. We believe that the main carrier of the disease could be antelopes. Where the disease came from and its origin will become certain once the results are ready.
Q. Is it likely that the disease will spread further to other provinces?
A. We are sure that the vaccines will prevent further spreading. However, it is too early to dub as the FMD virus become more active during cold seasons. We are doing everything we can to prevent further spreading.

[Mongolia reported to the OIE 2 FMD epizootics in 2013. One (2 foci), in western Mongolia, caused by FMDV serotype A, had reportedly started on 4 Jul 2013, declared resolved 6 Sep 2013. The 2nd epizootic, located at the eastern part of the country (one single focus), similarly caused by serotype A, reportedly started 18 Sep 2013 and was declared resolved 28 Oct 2013. A new epizootic has been notified to the OIE on 1 Feb 2014, reportedly started on 26 Jan 2014, involving 3 cattle holdings in the south-east, similarly caused by FMDV serotype A (the report with interactive map is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=14726). Similarly to the 2 previous epizootics of 2013, its location is adjacent to Mongolia's border with China.

According to media information of 9 Feb 2014, citing experts, "there are over 100 antelope and other livestock without owners with FMD infection symptoms along the infected soums borders" (posting 20140212.2273949). In Mongolia's follow-up report no 1, dated 4 Feb 2014, no additional outbreaks were included and the epizootic termed "continuing". According to the information in the media report above, the virus is rapidly spreading, recorded in 3 additional provinces; a new follow-up report identifying the updated geographical distribution of the outbreaks and further epidemiological information on the affected animal population, is expected soon.

The FMDV serotype A strains, which caused the 2 epizootics, in west and east Mongolia, during 2013, have both been genotyped by the WRLFMD (Pirbright) as topotype ASIA, Genotype/strain Sea-97 and were found closely related to the Chinese strain circulating throughout China since early 2013 (see posting 20140204.2251888).

According to the useful comments in Dr Baatar's interview, "where the [current] disease came from and [what was] its origin will become certain once its genotyping results are received in a month." It will be interesting to note if the currently circulating virus is of similar genetic profile as the 2013 Mongolian strains, and if the vaccine strain applied is a compatible one. Generally, genotyping is accomplished in the WRLFMD within days of sample's admittance.

Dr Baatar further raised the suspicion of antelopes being the reservoir of the virus. This assumption was not supported by a research published in 2012, which addressed several FMDV serotype O strains and one Asia 1 strain, involved in outbreaks during the years 2000-2010; it did not address FMDV serotype A (see reference). More information on the issue, in particular the results of recent serological and virological surveillance in the suspected wild antelopes (_Procapra gutturosa_) and data on their recent migration routes and chronology, will be useful.
