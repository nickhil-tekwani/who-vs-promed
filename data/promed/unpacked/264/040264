[1] USA: anatomy of 4 hotspot states
Date: Tue 30 Jun 2020

As coronavirus [COVID-19] outbreaks are slowly brought to heel in many places around the world, the US is among a handful of countries facing a surge of new infections. More than 2 dozen states are now seeing increases in new cases over the last 14 days. Of these, Texas, Florida, Arizona, and California have emerged as the country's latest virus epicentres. But while cases are clearly rising, state leaders and health experts are divided on the cause. Here's a look at these 4 US hotspots, the facts and figures raising alarm, and the theories that may help explain each surge.

What about testing?
First, it's important to note that across the US, more efficient testing has played some role in the climbing case count. The number of COVID-19 tests being administered now is nearly double what it was in April [2020] and May [2020]. But the positive test rate tells us that testing can't explain away the rise. If lots of tests are being conducted and the spread of the coronavirus has been reduced, then the positive case rate would fall in tandem. The World Health Organization says that states should have a positive case rate at or below 5% for 2 weeks before they loosen restrictions on movement.

Even with testing success stories, it's clear that the southern and western US are seeing a particularly sharp spike in infections and their rate. As of [30 Jun 2020], Texas, Florida, Arizona, or California, all fall under that category -- and all fail to meet the bar.

Texas
-----
After nearly 3 months of new cases hovering between 1000 and 2000 each day -- Texas' infection count has spiked in the last 2 weeks, with up to 6000 new illnesses reported in a single day. The sharp rise in cases has been mirrored by record highs in hospital admissions -- reaching at 5913 on Monday [29 Jun 2020] -- and stoking fears that the state's hospitals will soon be overwhelmed. If this trajectory persists, Houston, the state's most populous city, "would become the worst affected city in the US," possibly rivalling what's happening now in Brazil, wrote Peter Hotez, director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children's Hospital, on Twitter. "I cannot really see how things get better on their own." Why the rise? Many point to the south-western state's leading role peeling back lockdown measures.

Texas Governor Greg Abbott allowed his stay home order to expire on [30 Apr 2020], with almost all businesses -- including bars and restaurants -- operating to at least 50% capacity by early June [2020]. Last week [week of 22 Jun 2020], amid the surge, the governor shut down all bars and ordered restaurants to cut down capacity from 75 to 50%. "If I could go back and redo anything, it probably would have been to slow down the opening of bars," Mr Abbott said to El Paso station KVIA-TV. A "bar setting, in reality, just doesn't work with a pandemic."

Packed restaurants and bars may also fit with another national trend: the average age of people diagnosed with COVID-19 has decreased gradually throughout the pandemic. In certain counties, people under the age of 30 make up the majority of COVID patients, Mr Abbott said at a press conference earlier this month [June 2020], which "typically results from people going to the bar-type settings".

Parts of the state are now also enacting rules on face coverings. Policies on masks are one of the factors differentiating states like Texas from those seeing lower transmission rates. In 11 states with mask rules in place -- including New York and Illinois -- the number of new cases has declined 25% in the last 2 weeks, according to an analysis by the Philadelphia Inquirer. On the other hand, in states where only some employees have to wear masks, new cases have risen by an average of 70%.

Florida
-------
Florida's stay home order expired shortly after Texas', on 4 May [2020]. While the state's most populous counties, Miami-Dade and Broward, held off until 18 May [2020], Florida still had one of the more aggressive reopening strategies in the US. Disney properties and beaches began reopening by the end of last month [May 2020], just as Americans across the country celebrated the Memorial Day holiday [the last Monday in May]. Days into June [2020], bars, restaurants, gyms, and shops were also resuming business.

Now, the Sunshine State is seeing a surge in COVID-19 -- this past weekend [27-28 Jun 2020] saw over 8500 new cases per day. In the last 2 weeks, cases have increased 5-fold, according to the New York Times. Hospitalisations are up as well, but Florida's death toll has not seen so sharp a rise thus far. The governor's answer for why that may be lines up with what the White House has said: more testing and more young people with infections.

Republican Governor Ron DeSantis said a backlog "test dump" coupled with transmission in the 18 to 35 age range is behind the concerning counts. He said that 20% of Floridians aged 25 to 34 are testing positive, and called on younger residents to be more careful, citing graduation parties that ignored social distancing rules. "We've been stressing avoiding the 3 Cs, which are: closed spaces with poor ventilation, crowded places with many people nearby, and close-contact settings, such as close-range conversations," Mr DeSantis said. But some experts say even with testing, the numbers still point to community spread linked to more social contact.

Former CDC Director Tom Frieden told Fox News on Sunday [28 Jun 2020]: "As a doctor, a scientist, an epidemiologist, I can tell you with 100% certainty that in most states where you're seeing an increase, it is a real increase. It is not more tests; it is more spread of the virus."

Mr DeSantis has stopped short of enacting any mandatory measures to curb COVID-19 transmission -- however, mayors in South Florida, the hardest-hit region of the state, have been discussing next steps. In Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and Palm Beach, beaches will be closed for the Fourth of July Independence Day weekend. Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez will also be limiting gatherings to no more than 50 people, with masks required.

Arizona
-------
Arizona may be the region with the most concerning surge in America. In mid-June [2020], a Harvard epidemiologist noted the state had a higher case count and percent positivity rate than Brazil and Peru at the time. It's a familiar story here too: the south-western state's spike follows its reopening timeline. Republican Governor Doug Ducey lifted Arizona's stay-at-home order on 15 May [2020]. In the time since, dine-in restaurants, bars, casinos, gyms, golf clubs, and swimming pools reopened. There were health recommendations but no mandate on face coverings or enforcement of social distancing.

As of [30 Jun 2020], cases have been increasing by 85% in a 14-day period, according to the COVID Exit Strategy tracker. Saturday [27 Jun 2020] alone saw a new record of over 3500 new infections reported. Arizonians between 20- and 44-years-old make up the bulk of the nearly 80 000 confirmed cases, but 1200 of its 1600 deaths are from those aged 65 and up, according to state data. Native Americans make up 18% of the state's deaths, but just over 5% of the state's population.

In addition to the case counts, it's the speed at which they're increasing that concerns health experts. Arizona's summertime climate could be adding to the problem, as many opt for indoor activities thanks to the triple-digit temperatures [Fahrenheit -- over 40-45 degrees centigrade/Celsius]. Among indigenous groups, some households are without running water, making frequent hand-washing difficult, and live in areas with limited access to healthcare facilities.

There has also been local pushback to following health guidance, with anti-lockdown and, more recently, anti-mask rallies. Amid this new outbreak, Arizona's hospitals -- which are in emergency mode -- have warned intensive care units (ICU) could soon be overwhelmed. Bed space is already in short supply, with 88% of ICU beds and 84% of hospital inpatient beds occupied, according to AZ Central. The state's health director on Monday [30 Jun 2020] announced hospitals could activate "crisis care standards" that would allow them to prioritise resources to patients based on factors like likelihood of survival.

Following criticism from public health officials and Democrats over his inaction, Mr Ducey ordered bars, nightclubs, gyms, movie theatres, and water parks to shut for at least 30 days to "relieve stress" on the healthcare system on [29 Jun 2020].

California
----------
Of the 4 states hit hardest by the resurgence, California is in many ways an outlier. Its [19 Mar 2020] stay home order -- the 1st in the nation -- is widely credited with helping guard against the death tolls seen in other large states like New York and New Jersey. But 2 months after Governor Gavin Newsom said the COVID curve had "arguably flattened", cases are now sharply on the rise, hitting an all-time single day high of new cases on [30 Jun 2020], with 8086 confirmed new cases. Hospital admissions jumped 43% in the last 2 weeks.

Los Angeles County has the most COVID-19 cases confirmed in the nation, at over 100 000 as of [30 Jun 2020], according to a Johns Hopkins University count. Local health officials have warned that one in 140 residents may unknowingly have the virus -- last week [week of 22 Jun 2020], that estimate was one in 400.

California officials pin the surge in part to a rise in social and family gatherings, particularly among residents in the 18-49 age group, who make up the majority of California's positive cases. Easing restrictions on indoor businesses, like gyms and restaurants, likely also played a role. State leaders have also noted that many bars and restaurants were not following social distancing protocols or requiring face coverings.

Seven counties on Sunday [28 Jun 2020], including Los Angeles, were ordered to shut their bars. Counties and cities, like San Francisco, have reversed reopening plans. Disney also delayed plans to reopen, citing a lack of guidance from the state.

Clusters of the virus have emerged in prisons, nursing homes, as well as rural and urban areas. The San Francisco Bay Area's San Quentin Prison reported more than 1000 COVID-19 cases among its 3500 inmates this week, following a transfer earlier this month [June 2020] from a prison experiencing an outbreak.

State data also shows a significantly higher number of Latino residents have been infected: Latinos account for around 39% of the state's population, but 56% of the total positive cases as of [30 Jun 2020]. California's big cities, like thousands across the nation, also saw massive protests in the wake of George Floyd's death -- though we still don't have data on how those gatherings may affect the virus' spread.

[Take away messages: Premature lifting of restrictions leads to resurgences of SARS-CoV2 transmission. Many of the population think that lifting of restrictions means the virus is gone, so non-pharmaceutical measures such as face masks and social distancing are also unnecessary. Many of the 20- and 30-year-old population wants to "party" and partying means not observing social distancing and not wearing masks. Bars, clubs, and indoor dining are high risk activities when social distancing is not observed. Solution: lift restrictions when criteria are met re: decreasing transmission in an area, and do so with increased risk communication to ensure the proper messages are consistently communicated. And do something about the politics of health leading to the mixed messages the population is receiving.- Mod.MPP

[The outbreak in Beijing continues with 3 newly confirmed cases attributed to the outbreak. The 1st case in Beijing was reported on 11 Jun 2020; as of 30 Jun 2020, there have been 328 cases reported from Beijing, 21 in Hebei, and 3 in Liaoning, most likely associated with this outbreak.

There were 3 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic individuals and 1 new conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. Since 18 May 2020, there have been 29 cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic infections reported by China.

Takeaway message: China continues to have importations of infected individuals with the SARS-CoV-2; many of whom are detected as asymptomatic at the time of positive PCR testing. Cases are still being confirmed in Beijing.

[In the past 24 hours, according to the report at the source URL, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 51 cases with no new deaths, compared with 43 cases and no new deaths in the previous day (29 Jun 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 80 consecutive days. There were 36 locally transmitted cases: Gwangju (12), Gyeonggi (11), Seoul (9), Daejeon (3), and Daegu (1); and 15 imported cases -- airport quarantine (5), Gyeonggi (5), Incheon (2), Daejeon (1), Chungnam (1), and Jeonnam (1). There were 9 provinces reporting no newly confirmed cases.

According to data from the "ncov" website of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the cumulative confirmation rate has been 1.0% (http://ncov.mohw.go.kr/).

The overall impression hasn't changed: Lifting of measures has been accompanied by increases in locally acquired infections through increasing clusters related to gatherings of people at employment (bringing it outside employment to contacts) and in houses of worship, and bars and clubs. But, that being said, importations are also playing a major role in the country. It would be nice to know the asymptomatic rate being detected, and the proportion of asymptomatic infections detected that go on to clinical disease.

Tabular and graphic analyses of the situation in South Korea with the addition of the 43 newly confirmed cases from 29 Jun 2020 are available at the English language page (<https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=a30402000000&bid=0030), notices 405 and 406. There are analyses of the country-wide situation including the newly confirmed cases including listings of current ongoing clusters. 4 of the clusters mentioned are related to religious gatherings, and 1 related to a family gathering (the same as the previous day).

Importations came from Americas (3), Europe (1), Africa (2), Asia excluding China (14), (Kazakhstan 10, Pakistan 2, Afghanistan 1, and Kuwait 1).

Takeaway message: Importations continue to be a challenge, and gatherings whether social or religious are key foci for enlarging clusters (unchanged from previous 2 day's message).

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is up by +142 cases and +23 deaths in the past 24 hours. The previous day's (29 Jun 2020) 24-hour change was +126 cases and +6 deaths. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are still in decline. Cases still continue to be concentrated in Lombardy, the original epicenter of the outbreak (see tables at the link on the source URL to "download the latest data"). Lombardy again reported the largest number of newly confirmed cases in the 24-hour period (62). Campania (24), Emilia-Romagna (20), Piedmont (11) are the only other provinces reporting 10 or more cases. A total of 17 provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (8 provinces reported no new cases). Italy is now 56 days post phase 2 initial opening up and 40 days post 2nd stage of phase 2 opening up. For more detailed information on the outbreak, I suggest going to the source URL above.

Takeaway message: Northern Italy still warrants close monitoring, the virus is still present. In addition, Campania in the south (Naples is the capital of Campania) warrants watching as a new location with increasing cases.

Iran's Health Ministry spokeswoman says 147 patients have died of the novel coronavirus in the past 24 hours, increasing the overall death toll to 10 817. In her press briefing on Tuesday [30 Jun 2020], Sima-Sadat Lari confirmed 2457 new cases of COVID-19 infection, increasing the total number of infections to 227 662.

According to the spokeswoman, 188 758 patients have so far recovered from COVID-19, but 3049 are still in severe conditions of the disease. She said so far 1 666 587 COVID-19 tests have been taken across the country.

According to Lari, Khuzestan, Kurdistan, East and West Azerbaijan, Hormozgan, Bushehr, Khorasan Razavi, and Kermanshah provinces are considered as red zones.

[As of 30 Jun 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran is 227 662, including 10 817 deaths, an increase of 2457 cases and 147 deaths since 29 Jun 2020. According to this article, 8 provinces are considered "red zones", and yesterday's report mentioned an additional 3 provinces with "alarming situations" (Ilam, Lorestan, and Golestan).

Takeaway message: Premature lifting of restrictions is taking its toll in Iran as is elsewhere in the world. Unfortunately, many people think that lifting of restrictions means the virus has gone away and measures like mask wearing and social distancing are no longer necessary.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA as per Worldometer data for the top 20 reporting entities. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 2 727 853, including 130 122 deaths, an increase from 2 681 811 cases and 128 783 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York City had a cumulative total of 212 072 cases as of 14:00 EDT (GMT-4) on 30 Jun 2020, including 18 492 confirmed deaths and an additional 4604 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

The top 10 states in terms of daily reported cases in descending order are Texas, California, Florida, Arizona, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, Louisiana, and Alabama. This list includes states that are showing major increases in daily cases reported beginning with the lifting of restrictions around the end of May 2020. All but Alabama reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, with the range being 1042 to 7959. Both Texas and California each reported just shy of 8000 cases.

In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by California, New Jersey, Texas, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Arizona. The same ranking as yesterday (30 Jun 2020). A total of 41 states and entities have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.

In the past 24 hours, the proportion of newly confirmed cases was 1.7%. The 7-day average of newly confirmed cases for the past 7 days is 40.7% higher than the 7-day average for the preceding 7 days, consistent with the ongoing pandemic in the country picking up momentum.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html has data on cases, hospitalization, testing, and epidemiologic variables such as age, race, ILI (influenza-like illness), surveillance, and emergency room visits, which are definitely worth reviewing, as a welcome series of analyses. According to the CDC data, the percentages of laboratory specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 with a molecular assay is 10% positive tests out of 33 601 847 tests performed, consistent with the ongoing, as yet not under control pandemic in the country (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html).

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 30 Jun 2020.

Highlights
----------
- Yemen is the world's worst humanitarian emergency and the already vulnerable people of Yemen are facing the added threat of COVID-19. This new burden on medical facilities could result in a catastrophic death toll. WHO and the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Centre have joined forces to ensure access to healthcare for the vulnerable in remote areas through the provision of a minimum service package.

- UNICEF and WHO have supported a national immunization campaign in Syria amid the COVID19 pandemic. There has been about a 5% reduction in vaccination coverage in the 1st half of 2020, mainly as a result of challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. During the 5-day immunization campaign, implemented by the Syrian Ministry of Health, health workers checked the vaccination status of more than 900 000 children and vaccinated more than 210 100 children.

- To promote community empowerment and trust, a 'Global Risk Communication and Community Engagement Collective Service' has been launched by WHO, UNICEF and IFRC with support from the Global Outbreak and Response Network and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. See 'Subject in Focus' below for more information.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update (please note that there has been consistent weekend reporting artifact since the presentation of these data began):
-----------------------------------------
The Americas region reported 57.5% of the global newly reported cases and 59.2% of newly reported deaths for this 24-hour period. The USA reported 43.5% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, and Brazil reported 32.3%, Mexico and Chile 4.3%, Peru 3.6%, Colombia 3.4%, and Argentina 2.3%. The same 5 countries remained at the top; the USA and Brazil are usually numbers 1 and 2, although they vary for which of the 2 positions they hold, but other countries are continuing to increase their proportional representation within the region.

The European region reported 11.5% of the global newly reported cases and 10.5% of the newly confirmed deaths in the region. Russia reported 35.5% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Sweden 13.4%, Turkey 7.3%, the UK 4.3%, France 4.1%, Ukraine 3.7%, Azerbaijan 2.9%, Kazakhstan and Germany 2.6%, and Armenia 2.2%. The proportion of cases represented by Russia continues to decrease. Sweden did not report any newly confirmed cases yesterday (29 Jun 2020) so I suspect the major increase may be weekend delayed reporting. Armenia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, and Ukraine are prominent in countries noted to have resurgence in Europe. The reappearance of Germany and France on this highlighted list (more than 2.0%) also bears watching.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 9.9% of the global newly reported cases and 13.6% of global newly reported fatalities. Saudi Arabia reported 24.2%, of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Pakistan 17.4%, Iran 15.6%, Iraq 10.7%, Egypt 9.6%, Oman 5.6%, Qatar 4.3%, and Kuwait 3.6%. Multiple countries are very active in the region -- same countries in the same order as yesterday (29 Jun 2020).

The African region reported 5.5% of the global newly reported cases and 3.3% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 68.5% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Nigeria 6.3%, Algeria 3.3%, Mauritania 2.7%, and Gabon 2.1%. Other countries of prior prominence are less than 2%. South Africa and Nigeria are usually numbers 1 and 2 (although Ghana surpassed Nigeria yesterday 29 Jun 2020, but didn't report any cases today) in terms of the 24-hour increase in cases, other countries have less consistent reporting patterns and vary considerably from day to day.

The Western Pacific region reported 0.89% of the global newly reported cases and 0.28% of global deaths. The Philippines reported 67.3% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Singapore 13.8%, Japan 8.0%, Australia 5.5%, South Korea 2.9%, and China 1.6%. The outbreak associated with the Beijing seafood markets continues to bring China to prominence in terms of daily newly confirmed cases. That said, the Philippines and Singapore are consistently numbers 1 and 2, respectively, and the other countries, including Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Australia, vary in daily reporting, although today's ordering is identical to yesterday's.

The South East Asia region reported 14.7% of the global newly reported cases and 13.1% of global deaths. India reported 76.8% of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 16.6%, Indonesia 4.5%, and Nepal 2.0%. Same countries, same order as in previous days, with India continuing to be the driving force in the regional growth in cases.

Impression: The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed cases on a daily basis, followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean alternating on a daily basis of their order, followed by the Africa region and the Western Pacific representing the lowest daily case load of all of the regions. There is still weekend artifact with prominent countries not reporting any cases and others reporting probable backlog from the weekend.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 30 Jun 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent visual representation of the epidemic as described in the above text. The Americas region continues to increase, as does South-East Asia, in terms of daily newly confirmed cases; the African region is noticeably increasing as well. The Americas region continues to greatly outnumber all other regions for daily reporting. - Mod.MPP]

[*On 2 Jun 2020, France completed a review of all positive lab tests reported and removed all duplicate tests on individuals who were counted more than once. This led to a decrease in cumulative case counts.

[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of reported cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 10 584 016, with reports of cases by 217 countries and territories worldwide. The global case count rose by 1.7% in the past 24 hours. The USA, with more than 2.72 million confirmed cases, now represents 26.0% of the global cases of COVID-19, and Brazil with more than 1.40 million cases represents 13.4% of the global cases of COVID-19. Other countries such as Chile, Peru, Mexico, India, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Pakistan are reporting increased numbers of new and cumulative cases as well. If one tallies the total cumulative case counts for the top 5 countries (USA, Brazil, Russia, India, and the UK), they represent over half of the total cases reported globally (53.7%). A global total of 513 861 deaths have been reported, an increase of 5845 deaths in the past 24 hours.

A reminder that in the absence of well-developed contact-tracing activities with testing of asymptomatic and mildly ill contacts, numbers of SARS-CoV-2 virus infections are significantly underreported: actual numbers may be 10-20 times larger. There are also individuals who stay at home throughout their illness, sometimes, unfortunately, dying at home, who are never officially confirmed as infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These data are presented to provide relative indicators of the situations in each of the countries and comparisons between countries and regions of the world.

In descending rank order, the USA is number 1 for cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19, followed by Brazil, Russia, India, the UK, Spain, Peru, Chile, Italy, and Iran at number 10. China is number 22 (unchanged). In descending rank order, the USA is number 1 for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by Brazil, India, South Africa, Russia, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh, Chile, and Peru; Pakistan was displaced from the top 10 by Peru in the past 24 hours. All countries that are currently experiencing major community-based transmission and considered global hot spots. The range in daily newly confirmed cases went from 2848 to 46 042.

The top 20 countries in terms of cumulative cases include 7 from the European region, 7 from the Americas region, 3 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 from the South-East Asia region, and 1 from the African region (an increase in 1 from the Americas region and decrease in 1 from the Eastern Mediterranean region. There are no countries from the Western Pacific region. The top 20 countries in terms of numbers of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours include 7 from the Americas region, 6 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 3 from the South-East Asia region, 2 from the European region, 1 from the Western Pacific region (the Philippines) and 1 from the African region (an increase of 2 in the South East Asia region, and 1 in the Western Pacific region, and a decrease in 2 from the European region and 1 from the Americas region). Again, there are no countries from the Western Pacific region. This listing very much reflects the "hot spots" in terms of countries and regions with ongoing high transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Impression: The SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world. - Mod.MPP]
