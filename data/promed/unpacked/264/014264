Indonesia confirms 120th human bird flu infection
-------------------------------------------------
A 30 year old man has been confirmed as the 120th bird flu victim in the
nation worst hit by the virus, the health ministry said. The man is being
treated in a Jakarta hospital for the disease, which has claimed 97 lives
in Indonesia. A total of 2 laboratory tests on the man showed that he was
infected with the highly pathogenic virus, a statement from the ministry's
bird flu centre said on Tuesday [22 Jan 2008]. A total of 2 positive
results of tests on blood and tissue samples are needed before Indonesian
authorities can confirm a human bird flu infection.
The man, who is from the Jakarta satellite city of Tangerang, was first
admitted to a private hospital there on 14 Jan 2008. He was then referred
to Jakarta's Persahabatan hospital on 20 Jan 2008 when his condition
deteriorated.
"His condition was very bad when he came in to hospital. The patient is now
in intensive care with severe pneumonia," the head of the hospital's avian
influenza team Dr Muchtar Ihsan said. He said the patient was believed to
have contracted the virus from birds in his neighbourhood. "It has been
reported that there are swallow nests and poultry farms around the
patient's home," Dr Ihsan said.
The man was the 8th person from Tangerang to be confirmed with the disease
since October 2007. The other 7 cases ended in death. Humans are typically
infected with bird flu by coming into direct contact with infected poultry,
but experts fear the H5N1 virus may mutate into a form easily transmissible
between humans, sparking a deadly global pandemic.

[Tangerang is a satellite city situated about 20km (12.4 miles) west of
Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia. It is the 2nd largest urban centre
in the Jabotabek region after Jakarta. It has a population of around 1.5
million people. (Map at

A total of 7 human cases of H5N1 avian influenza have occured there during
the past 4 months, and all have been fatal, which does not augur well for
this 8th victim. The high concentration of cases in an urban area is
unusual and something that deserves further investigation. - Mod.CP]
