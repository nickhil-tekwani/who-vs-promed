Tests point to cholera outbreak
-------------------------------
Tests conducted by the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases
have revealed that nearly all the patients admitted to the Infectious
Diseases (ID) Hospital at Beleghata following the gastroenteritis outbreak
in several parts of Calcutta were victims of cholera.
A report submitted to the state health department by the institute says
that as many as 99 per cent of the over 1500 patients admitted to the ID
Hospital between 5 and 17 Apr 2004 -- the period during which the spate of
casualties was highest -- were suffering from diarrhea caused by _Vibrio
cholerae_ O1 bacteria.
Hundreds of residents in the congested slum areas of Narkeldanga,
Rajabazar, Tangra, and Beniapukur had to be rushed to the hospital with
symptoms of severe dehydration and stomach upset following consumption of
contaminated piped water provided by the Corporation.
The route of infection for both gastroenteritis and cholera is the same:
the fecal-oral route. Experts explained that unhygienic habits, like taking
meals near toilets, lead to contamination of both food and water. Doctors
at the ID hospital, however, point out that most of the patients admitted
got the infection through polluted water. Sewage water, leaking through
damaged pipes, had mixed with filtered drinking water.
Though the symptoms and treatment for attacks of gastroenteritis and
cholera are the same, an infection with the latter could be fatal if
medication is not provided. Health department officials, however, say that
cholera is usual in Calcutta with the onset of summer, and the number of
admissions was coming down.
