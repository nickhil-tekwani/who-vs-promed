A fresh outbreak of bird flu was reported in Darjeeling Wednesday [7
Jan 2009], prompting the authorities to restart culling operations,
an official said.

"We have started culling operations at Rangli Ranglikot area of
Darjeeling. This time, a total of 7000 poultry will be culled,"
district magistrate Surendra Gupta told IANS over the telephone.

Gupta said the blood samples of dead poultry from the area sent to
the High Security Disease Diagnostic Laboratory in Bhopal had tested
positive for avian flu.

"We got the reports Wednesday [7 Jan 2009] that confirmed that the
dead birds had H5N1 virus," Gupta said.

About 31 000 poultry have already been culled at Matigara in Siliguri
subdivision and Pubang in Takdah of Darjeeing sub-division of the
same district after avian flu was confirmed in the areas Saturday [3 Jan 2009].

The development came 18 days after bird flu struck Malda district in the state.
