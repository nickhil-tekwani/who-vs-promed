British holidaymakers warned of toxic seaweed in northern France
----------------------------------------------------------------
As of right now, many British holidaymakers are being told to stay away
from beaches located in northern France. These warnings have been issued
due to toxic fumes that are being given off by rotting seaweed. This
problem has now led to one area of the beach at Saint Michel en Greve in
Brittany to be shut down. The beach was shut after a horse rider lost
consciousness and his horse died after being exposed to the fumes.

A member of the French Institute of Sea Research and Exploitation, Gilles
Youenou, said that they advise people to avoid these beaches. The seaweed
is giving off hydrogen sulphide fumes. This can be the result of a problem
with agriculture. He noted that nitrates have gotten into the water and
polluted it.

Gilles Youenou went on to say that normally a crust forms over stacks of
rotting seaweed. When the crust is broken, fumes are released. These fumes
can be particularly lethal to dogs, as well as other animals. This helps to
explain why the horse was killed.

A spokesman for the French environmental group Eau et Rivieres said that
toxic seaweed has been found on the beaches of Brittany for quite some
time. Now the problem seems to be spreading. He noted that there are
already almost 5 beaches that are unusable, and the problem is just getting
worse.

Eau et Rivieres says that almost 70 000 cubic metres of seaweed has to be
cleared off from 70 beaches every summer in Brittany. The Lannion hospital
in Brittany has said that the hydrogen sulphide is as dangerous as cyanide.
The hospital has already treated many cases of poisoning caused by the
seaweed among local residents. These included one council worker who was
paid to clear beaches of algae. The woman was found in a coma.

[The nitrates in the water may have allowed extra growth of the seaweed,
assuming it responds to fertilizer, but any heap of rotting vegetation
could give off hydrogen sulfide gas. There is no connection to the nitrates
in the water as implied in the article.

Hydrogen sulfide is a gas that is flammable, colorless, and heavier than
air, most often associated with its trademark odor of rotten eggs.
Unfortunately the olfactory senses rapidly accommodate to the odor and the
smell is no longer recognized. The sense of smell is not always reliable or
dependable.

Exposures to very high concentrations are most often fatal in a matter of
minutes. Exposure to lower concentrations may cause clinical signs such as
nausea, belching and coughing, and eye irritation.

Hydrogen sulfide is found naturally in rotten eggs, decomposing carcasses,
volcanic eruptions, and many bacterial systems. It is used in various
chemical reactions and for purposes such as metallurgy.

Those doing the clean up should have the proper personal protective
equipment to protect the eyes and the respiratory system. - Mod.TG
