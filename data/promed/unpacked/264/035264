Rabbit haemorrhagic disease, United States of America
-----------------------------------------------------
Information received on 22 Apr 2010 from Dr John Clifford, Deputy
Administrator, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, United
States Department of Agriculture, Washington, United States of America

Summary
Report type: Immediate notification
Start date 07 Feb 2010
Date of 1st confirmation of the event 20 Apr 2010
Report date 22 Apr 2010
Date submitted to OIE 22 Apr 2010
Reason for notification: Reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence 28 Mar 2008
Manifestation of disease: Sub-clinical infection
Causal agent: Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus
Nature of diagnosis Laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to the whole country

New outbreaks
Outbreak 1 Pine County, Pine County, Minnesota
Date of start of the outbreak 07 Feb 2010
Outbreak status: Continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Farm
Species Rabbits
Susceptible 25
Cases 25
Deaths 25
Destroyed 0
Slaughtered 0
Affected Population: The index premises is a private residence that
receives donated rabbits to use as a food source at a wildlife centre.
This is a non-commercial incident.
Epidemiology - Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection.
Unknown or inconclusive.

Epidemiological comments: The USDA Animal Plant Health Inspection
Services (APHIS) and the Minnesota Board of Animal Health are
conducting a comprehensive epidemiological investigation of this event.

-- Donated rabbits are received at a wildlife centre in Washington
County then transferred to the index premises, a private residence,
where they live until they are needed as a food source at the wildlife centre.

-- Twenty rabbits died suddenly on the index premises approximately 2
months ago, and feed contamination was suspected as the cause of
death. All new rabbits taken to the index premises after the initial
rabbit deaths also died suddenly without exhibiting clinical signs.

-- Tissue samples were submitted to a private laboratory which
suspected rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD). Tissue samples were
subsequently submitted to the National Veterinary Services
Laboratories (NVSL) Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (FADDL).

-- Trapping or surveillance of free ranging rabbits will occur at the
index premises and the wildlife centre. Note: in Minnesota the
predominant wild rabbits are eastern cottontails and black-tailed
jackrabbits, not known to be susceptible to RHD.

Control measures:
Measures applied - Quarantine;
Disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s);
Vaccination prohibited; No treatment of affected animals

Laboratory name and type: NVSL Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic
Laboratory (National laboratory)
Species Rabbits
Test antigen (Ag) detection ELISA
Test date 20 Apr 2010
Result Positive

Future Reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[Rabbit hemorrhagic disease is also known as rabbit calicivirus. The
disease is a high mortality one and spreads very easily and rapidly.
It can be transmitted by contact with infected rabbits, rabbit
products and fomites such as cages, bedding, food and water. It can
also remain viable for months in frozen rabbit meat and decomposing carcasses.

The disease is endemic in wild rabbits in Europe, Australia, New
Zealand and Cuba with 40 countries have experienced outbreaks. It 1st
was recognized in China in 1984 and 2st caused problems in the
Western Hemisphere in Mexico in 1988 in association with a shipment
of imported frozen rabbits from China found traced to a supermarket
in Mexico City. This certainly helps make the case for how a global
food supply promotes the emergence of diseases. Mexico has worked
hard to successfully eradicate the disease. Another, more insidious
method for spreading the disease to previous uninfected places was
the intentional illegal introduction of the virus in wild rabbit in
New Zealand by farmers hoping to dampen their numbers and control the pests.

The 1st outbreak in the United States was in Iowa in April 2000.
Subsequent U.S. outbreaks have occurred in Utah, Illinois, New York
and Indiana. These outbreaks, like the current one, were not in
commercial rabbit production facilities, and remain isolated events.
This Minnesota outbreak occurred in a facility which provides meat to
a wildlife rehabilitation center.

ProMED-mail hope to learn more about how the rabbit facility was
infected as there are many different ways this virus is transmitted;
i.e., food, fomites, frozen carcasses etc. Such knowledge would be
valuable in understanding the epidemiology of these 5 outbreaks and
protecting commercial and other rabbit facilities. - Mods.PC/FE]
