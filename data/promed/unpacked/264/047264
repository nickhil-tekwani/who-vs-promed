China, Viet Nam grapple with 'rapidly evolving' pig virus
---------------------------------------------------------
A pig disease ravaging China now appears to have spilled into Viet
Nam. Scientists fear that a deadlier strain of a longtime foe,
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), or blue ear
disease, may be on the loose.
"We're fairly confident that there has been an outbreak of PRRS
here," says Andrew Speedy, who represents the UN Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) in Viet Nam. An FAO mission that completed a
weeklong visit to Viet Nam on 20 Aug 2007 also uncovered many
secondary infections that increase the disease's death toll, Speedy
says. The team concluded that PRRS can likely be controlled through
vaccination and antibiotic treatment of secondary infections.
PRRS was 1st identified in the United States in the mid-1980s; the
causative arterivirus was isolated in 1991. The virus does not infect
humans. In pigs, it attacks macrophages, which ingest and remove
invading bacteria. With a crippled immune response, pigs are
susceptible to secondary infections. Adults usually recover and
develop immunity, but the virus and secondary infections can kill
piglets, whose ears often turn blue from the secondary infections.
"The evolution of the virus is really quite startling. It is probably
one of the most rapidly evolving viruses that I know of," says Trevor
Drew, head of virology at the Veterinary Laboratories Agency in
Weybridge, UK. He explains that, typically, a virus circulating in a
new host initially causes severe disease and becomes less pathogenic
over time. With PRRS there is evidence that the opposite has
occurred: a nonpathogenic strain was circulating among pigs in North
America before it evolved and started causing disease.
An even nastier strain seems to be on the rampage in China, killing
sows as well as piglets. This strain 1st appeared in the summer of
2006. China has reported losing 400 000 pigs to the disease through
death or culling in 2006 and another 243 000 this year [2007],
although some contend that official numbers vastly understate the losses.
In an analysis of viral samples from pigs in China published online
in PLoS ONE [Public Library of Science] on 13 Jun 2007, a group led
by George Gao, a microbiologist who heads the Institute of
Microbiology in Beijing, described a genetic variation that may be
responsible for the virus's increased deadliness. Drew, who finds
that claim plausible, says that the possibility of a new and deadlier
strain "is very worrisome."
Media outlets, including an article last week in The New York Times
[16 Aug 2007], reported allegations that China has refused to share
virus samples and cooperate with international organizations. Drew
says that's not so, pointing to Gao's paper and to China's reporting
on the outbreak to the Paris-based World Organization for Animal
Health [OIE]. Guo Fusheng of FAO's Beijing office says that the
organization has not yet asked China's Ministry of Agriculture for
samples or to allow an outside team to investigate, although it
expects to make a formal request shortly.
Viet Nam didn't wait to be asked. The disease was 1st reported there
in March [2007]. Last month [July 2007], the government asked FAO for
assistance after the outbreaks increased in June and July [2007].
Samples have been sent to US labs for analysis [see commentary].

Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS), commonly known
as blue ear disease, has recently stricken a number of pigs in Viet
Nam's southern Ba Ria Vung Tau province and central Binh Dinh
province, according to local newspaper People's Army report Wednesday
[22 Aug 2007].
Specimens from 40 pigs in Dat Do district in Ba Ria Vung Tau and some
of the animals in the 2 districts of Phu Cat and Tuy Phuoc in Binh
Dinh have tested positive to PRRS, the paper quoted Bui Quang Anh,
head of the Department of Animal Health under the Vietnamese Ministry
of Agriculture and Rural Development.
Local veterinary agencies are intensifying the culling of infected
pigs to prevent the disease from spreading.
Now, the disease is hitting 4 Vietnamese provinces, namely Quang Nam,
Quang Ngai, and Binh Dinh in the central area, and Ba Ria Vung Tau
[in the southern area; see map of areas and provinces at
<http://www.angelfire.com/co/hongnam/vnmap.html>. - Mod.AS]
PRRS is characterized by reproductive failure of sows and respiratory
problems of piglets and growing pigs. It occurs in most major
pig-producing areas throughout the world.
According to the World Organization for Animal Health, the
reproductive failure is characterized by infertility, late fetal
mummification, abortions, stillbirths, and the birth of weak piglets
that often die soon after birth from respiratory disease and
secondary infections.

[The support of FAO and the involvement of US laboratories in the
investigations regarding the Vietnamese pathogens are encouraging
news. Results are anticipated with interest, and expected to include
comparative studies with PRRS virus strains from other sources,
particularly China. To this end, provision of samples from China and
the cooperation of the Chinese scientists are essential. - Mod.AS]
