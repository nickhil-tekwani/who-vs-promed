[The addition of this case brings the total number of MERS-CoV cases reported by Jordan to 18 (or 25 if one counts the 7 cases retrospectively confirmed through serology from the original outbreak of April 2012), including 8 deaths. From the description provided above, it appears as though this case is part of the apparent nosocomial outbreak occurring in Jordan (see the WHO update in section [3] below for more details and discussions). - Mod.MPP]

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - Jordan
----------------------------------------------------------------
Between [26 and 28 Aug 2015], the National IHR Focal Point of Jordan notified WHO of 4 additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, including 1 death. All these cases are associated with a MERS-CoV outbreak currently occurring in a hospital in Amman city.

Details of the cases
1- A 60-year-old male living in Jeddah city, Saudi Arabia travelled to Amman city, Jordan on [28 Jul 2015]. He developed symptoms on [31 Jul 2015] and, on [10 Aug 20]15, was admitted to hospital. The patient, who had comorbidities, was treated symptomatically and discharged on [18 Aug 2015]. As symptoms relapsed, on [20 Aug 2015], the patient was admitted to another hospital in Amman on [23 Aug 2015]. He tested positive for MERS-CoV on [25 Aug 2015] and passed away on [27 Aug 2015]. Investigation of history of exposure to known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms is ongoing.

2- A 38-year-old male from Kuwait city, Kuwait travelled to Amman city, Jordan on [7 Aug 2015]. He developed symptoms on [12 Aug 2015] and, on [17 Aug 2015], was admitted to the hospital where a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case was hospitalized (case no 1 -- see above). Since his arrival in Amman city, he frequently visited a family member at the same hospital. The patient, who has no comorbidities, has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. He tested positive for MERS-CoV on [26 Aug 2015]. Currently, the patient is in critical condition in ICU. Investigation of possible epidemiological links with the index case or with shared health care workers is ongoing.

3- A 76-year-old male from Amman city developed symptoms. On [16 Aug 2015], due to his chronic condition, the patient was admitted to the hospital where a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case was hospitalized (case no. 1 - see above). He was discharged on the same day. On [20 Aug 2015], the patient was admitted to the same hospital for a medical procedure for his chronic condition and, on [24 Aug 2015], was discharged. On [25 Aug 2015], he developed symptoms and was admitted to the same hospital. The patient tested positive for MERS-CoV on [25 Aug 2015]. Currently, he is in critical condition in ICU. Investigation of possible epidemiological links with MERS-CoV cases admitted to his hospital or with shared health care workers is ongoing.

4- A 47-year-old female from Kuwait city, Kuwait travelled to Amman city, Jordan on [15 Jul 2015]. She was identified through the screening of contacts of a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case (case no 2 -- see above). The patient, who has no comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on [27 Aug 2015]. Currently, she is asymptomatic in home isolation. The patient visited her family members at the hospital where a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case was hospitalized (case no 1 -- see above). She has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms.

Contact tracing of household contacts and healthcare contacts is ongoing for these cases. The National IHR Focal Point of Jordan informed the National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia about the index case to trace contacts in Saudi Arabia.

Globally, WHO has been notified of 1478 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 516 related deaths.

[The WHO report above confirms there is an ongoing nosocomial outbreak of MERS-CoV in Amman, Jordan. It appears as though the index case came from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and was ill approximately 3 days after arrival in Amman, on 28 Jul 2015. The most recent case from Jeddah was reported on 13 Jul 2015 -- a 77-year-old Saudi male who had onset of illness on 27 Jun 2015, was admitted to hospital on 6 Jul 2015, and tested positive for MERS-CoV on 11 Jul 2015. That individual had a history of frequent contact with camels and ingestion of raw camel milk (see MERS-CoV (95): South Korea, Saudi Arabia, WHO 20150724.3531897 for more details). Results of the epidemiologic investigation surrounding the index case in Jordan will be interesting to know if there were identifiable high risk exposures. - Mod.MPP]
