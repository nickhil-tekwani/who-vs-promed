Four more Thai provinces report bird flu outbreak
----------------------------------------------
4 more spots in Thailand have been confirmed of undergoing avian influenza
outbreak, the Agriculture Ministry said here on Thursday [2 Sep 2004].
The new outbreak was reported in 2 northern provinces and one central
province, the ministry's Department of Livestock Development said on its
website Thursday.[<http://www.dld.go.th/>, in Thai,no active English
version. - Mod.AS]
So far, some 29 areas in 14 provinces have been under the authorities'
monitoring for the reappeared bird flu, which first hit the kingdom in the
beginning of 2004, according to the website. The bird flu virus killed 8
people in Thailand and 16 in Vietnam during the 1st wave of the outbreak.
Thailand, which culled an estimated 50-60 million birds in the 1st round of
the epidemic, has come up with a series of measures to deal with the newly
reported outbreak.
Besides, a national committee set up to deal with the epidemic is expected
to come up with plans to overhaul the poultry industry by the end of
September 2004.
Thailand, the world's 4th largest poultry exporter, suffered a USD 880
million loss in the 1st wave of bird flu crisis, when major buyers such as
Japan and EU stopped imports from Thailand.

[2] China, lifting restrictions

China lifts ban on sale of poultry from province most recently affected by
bird flu
------------------------------------------------
China's quarantine authority has ended an export ban on poultry products
from eastern Anhui province imposed in July due to an outbreak of bird flu,
the government said Tuesday [31 Aug 2004].
China imposed the ban on 7 Jul 2004 to help prevent a repeat of a regional
epidemic of the H5N1 strain of bird flu that killed 27 people in Vietnam
and Thailand earlier in 2004 and cost producers in China and Southeast Asia
millions of dollars in losses from culled stocks.
Authorities killed more than 6000 birds after discovering the disease had
resurfaced in poultry in Anhui. Those efforts were successful in quelling
the disease, the official Xinhua News Agency said in announcing the end of
the export ban. However, it said local officials were cautioned to "do a
good job" in conducting quarantine checks.
International health officials have expressed concern over the disclosure
that 2 strains of bird flu, including the H5N1 strain, were found earlier
in 2004 in pigs in China. That finding, experts say, suggests that a more
dangerous, mutant virus could yet erupt in Asia.

Study links migrating ducks to deadly bird flu
----------------------------------------------
A 9-month probe has linked migrating ducks to the deadly bird flu outbreak
in South Korea earlier this year, researchers said Thursday [2 Sep 2004].
Experts from the National Veterinary Quarantine Service said ducks and
other migratory birds were the most likely source of the outbreak of the
deadly H5N1 strain of avian influenza among poultry in South Korea.
"By comparing likely sources such as imported poultry meat and travellers,
we have identified migrating birds, mostly ducks, as the most likely source
for bringing the virus to this country," said Wi Sung-Hwan, a senior
researcher at the state agency.
The study showed the highly pathogenic virus first invaded ducks in the
central city of Cheonan around October 2003. Unnoticed, the virus then
spread to duck and chicken farms across the country, forcing quarantine
autorities to cull 5 million ducks and chickens to contain the [spread of
the] virus.
"You may be easily induced to suspect chickens as the source of the disease
as chickens show symptoms swiftly, mostly within a period of between 3 and
7 days after they attracted the virus," Wi told AFP.
"But ducks have a strong resistance to the flu. Even after being infected
with the virus, they just live on without showing any symptoms and their
farmers can hardly notice the problem," he said.
The flu virus was first detected in the central province of North
Chungcheong in December 2003 at a farm raising chicken and spread to the
southeast and southwest of the country.
Quarantine authorities have analyzed all 19 poultry farms which were hit by
the flu and confirmed that ducks were first infected, he said.
The H5N1 strain is known to pass from infected poultry to humans, but there
have been no reports of human infections in South Korea. The bird flu
claimed 19 lives in Vietnam and 8 others in Thailand in 2004 alone.
China, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia have also been hit by new outbreaks
of bird flu over the past couple of months, but only Vietnam has reported
human infections. The last death in Thailand occurred on 12 Mar 2004.
The World Health Organization has warned that it could take years to
eliminate the H5N1 virus from the environment.
