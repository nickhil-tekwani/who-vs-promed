Koch's postulates were developed during the "golden age of bacteriology."
The "one organism-one disease" breakthrough that resulted from application
of Koch's postulates is a landmark event in the evolution of our
understanding of infectious disease. And it has served us well...until the
advent of molecular biology and the discovery of novel infectious disease
mechanisms. Blind adherence to "the postulates" could actually retard
advancements in our understanding of new disease mechanisms. The
postulates were developed in the light of classical bacterial
diseases...and they work very well in that arena. Retroviruses, slow
viruses, latent viruses, and perhaps _Chlamydia pneumoniae_ behave in ways
that seem to put them outside of the application of Koch's postulates.
I hope that the microbiological/molecular biology communities do not end up
being hindered by narrow definitions and the advancement of our
understanding slowed by "sacred cows."
