animals remained healthy during the whole period of the

2003 and organ samples were collected. The diagnosis of malignant
catarrhal fever was confirmed on 5 Jun 2003, based on clinical

Food Research Institute, Helsinki.
B. Diagnostic tests used: PCR(1) from organ cell suspensions.

[This disease is not uncommon in the region. Although Finland has
been free of the disease since 1999, when it reported 11 cases,
there were a few cases each year between 1996 to 1998. Sweden,
Norway, and Russia have all reported cases for the past few years. -
