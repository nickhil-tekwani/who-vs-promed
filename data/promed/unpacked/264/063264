30 cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome [GBS], an inflammatory disorder
that may cause paralysis and breathing difficulties, have been
reported since late June [2007] in a northeastern China city, local
health sources said.
Most of the hospitalized patients, all from Shuangyang District in
Changchun, capital of Jilin Province, are in stable condition,
according to the city's disease control and prevention center. No
deaths have been reported from the disease, it added.
The syndrome, in which the immune system attacks nerves, has initial
symptoms of fever, aching throat, diarrhea and then weakness of legs
and arms. In serious cases, one's whole body can become paralyzed,
even the muscles used for breathing.
The exact cause of the disease is unknown, but medical experts
believe it may be triggered by respiratory infection or the stomach
flu. The potentially deadly disorder occurs most often in young
adults and the elderly.
The health authorities of Changchun have strengthened inspection on
food and drinking water safety and advised citizens not to eat untidy
food or drink un-boiled water as prevention methods.

[In 1976, there was an outbreak of GBS in the USA following
administration of the Swine Flu vaccine. A good review of this
episode and background information on GBS (and other suspected
neurologic events associated with receipt of influenza vaccine) can
be found in the Institute of Medicine's publication Immunization
Safety Review: Influenza Vaccines and Neurological Complications by
Stratton K, Alamario DA, Wizemann T, and McCormick MC, (Editors,
Immunization Safety Review Committee)
<http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10822.html?onpi_newsdoc0309090865>.
"GBS is an acute, immune-mediated paralytic disorder of the
peripheral nervous system. Estimates of the annual incidence of GBS
range from 0.4 to 4.0 cases per 100 000 population, with most studies
pointing to a level of from one to 2 cases per 100 000 (Hughes and
Rees, 1997; Magira et al., 2003). GBS occurs throughout the year, and
in the United States, the condition is more likely to occur in adults
than in children (Asbury, 2000).
About 2/3rds of GBS cases occur several days or weeks after an
infectious event (Hughes and Rees, 1997), commonly a diarrheal
illness or a virus-like upper-respiratory infection. From 20 percent
to 40 percent of all GBS cases are associated with _Campylobacter
jejuni_ infections (Buzby et al., 1997). Exposure to certain vaccines
has also been associated with an increased risk for GBS. The
potential association between GBS and influenza vaccines, most
notably the 1976 swine influenza vaccine, has been widely studied and
is the subject of this report.
The characteristic clinical feature of GBS is an acute, rapidly
progressive, symmetrical weakness, with loss of deep tendon reflexes,
possible tingling in the feet and hands, and muscle aches (myalgia).
Approximately 85 percent of patients will return to normal
functioning within 6 to 9 months, but some patients experience
relapses or a prolonged disease course with residual neurological
deficits (Asbury, 2000; Joseph and Tsao, 2002). The mortality rate is
3-5 percent, with patients succumbing to undetected respiratory
failure, malfunction of the autonomic nervous system, or to
complications of immobility, such as sepsis or pulmonary embolism
(Joseph and Tsao, 2002)."
As mentioned above, from 20 to 40 percent of cases of GBS have been
associated with campylobacteriosis. The newswire mention that actions
being taken in the affected area (Changchun, Jilin Province) include
educational messages aimed at food and waterborne disease, suggests
that this outbreak of GBS might be associated with a concurrent
gastrointestinal outbreak in Changchun. It should also be mentioned
that GBS has been confused/misdiagnosed for poliomyelitis in many
areas, especially when the incidence of polio has been markedly
reduced and the medical sector is no longer used to seeing active
cases of poliomyelitis (unpublished report to PAHO produced by this
moderator following evaluation of a polio epidemic in Brazil, 1985).
More information on this outbreak and possible predisposing etiology
would be appreciated.
