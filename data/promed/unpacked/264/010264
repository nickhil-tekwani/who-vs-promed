_Brucella canis_ is an under-recognized infection in dogs that poses a threat to human health, according to a report published in the August [2018] issue of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Emerging Infectious Diseases [1] .

Noting that in humans the infection can cause fever, chills, malaise, peripheral lymphadenomegaly, and splenomegaly, Martha E. Hensel, DVM, from Texas A&M University in College Station, and colleagues evaluated serologic data, transmission patterns, and regulations related to brucellosis in dogs, with a particular focus on the infection as an under-recognized zoonosis.

The researchers found that brucellosis in dogs remains endemic to many parts of the world and will probably remain a threat to human health and animal welfare unless stronger intervention measures are implemented. They propose implementation of mandatory testing of dogs before interstate or international movement as a 1st step for limiting disease spread.

"Future work is required to improve diagnostic assays for humans and animals and to generate policies to prevent the spread of disease," the authors wrote.

[Infection in the dog:

Although dogs occasionally become infected with _Brucella abortus_, _B suis_, or _B melitensis_, these sporadic occurrences typically are closely associated with exposure to infected domestic livestock

_Brucella canis_ is a cause of abortion at 45-55 days of gestation in kenneled dogs. Dogs are the only definitive host of this organism. Infection has caused a reduction of 75 percent in the number of pups weaned in some breeding kennels. The disease disseminates rapidly among closely confined dogs, especially at time of breeding or when abortions occur. Transmission occurs via ingestion of contaminated materials or venereal routes. Urine transmission has been reported but seems to be unusual. Both sexes appear to be equally susceptible.

Infected dogs may develop generalized lymphadenitis and frequently epididymitis, periorchitis, and prostatitis. Spondylitis and uveitis are occasional complications. Bacteremia is frequent and persists for about 18 months after exposure. Fever is not characteristic.

Lymphadenitis is common in dogs infected with _B. canis_ and may be regional or generalized. Epididymitis and scrotal edema can occur during the acute stage in infected males, and orchitis may be seen occasionally. Self-trauma (e.g., licking) can result in scrotal dermatitis. Concurrent prostatitis is common and may lead to pain and difficulty in urinating and defecating. Unilateral or bilateral testicular atrophy can be seen in chronic infections, and some males become infertile. Other male dogs can have abnormal sperm with morphological abnormalities and reduced viability. Occasionally reported clinical signs in dogs include lethargy or fatigue, exercise intolerance, decreased appetite, weight loss, and behavioral abnormalities (loss of alertness, poor performance of tasks); however, most animals do not appear seriously ill, and many are asymptomatic. Occasionally, discospondylitis can cause stiffness, lameness, or back pain. Chronic uveitis, unilateral endophthalmitis, dermatitis, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and meningoencephalitis/low-grade meningitis have also been reported. Fever is rare. Dogs with brucellosis may recover spontaneously beginning a year after infection, but recovery is more common after 2-3 years, and some animals remain chronically infected for years. Deaths are rare except in the fetus or newborn. http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/brucellosis_canis.pdf

Attempts at immunization of the dog have not been successful. Control is based on elimination or isolation of infected dogs identified by positive cultural or serologic tests at monthly intervals. Incidence of infection is much lower in kennels where dogs are caged individually. Long-term therapy (e.g., with a combination regimen of streptomycin or gentamicin and tetracycline) has been successful in many cases. Neutering of infected dogs is sometimes an alternative to euthanasia.

Prevention of canine brucellosis is done by testing before entry and breeding. The disease is reportable in some states. _B canis_ is zoonotic, although cases of human infection are rare and less severe than those caused by the smooth species of the genus. The true incidence is unknown. Appropriate measures to prevent exposure should be taken. https://www.merckvetmanual.com/reproductive-system/brucellosis-in-dogs/overview-of-brucellosis-in-dogs

Infection in humans:

Humans usually become infected with members of the genus _Brucella_ by ingesting organisms or via the contamination of mucous membranes (including the conjunctiva and respiratory tract) and abraded skin. In case reports, _B. canis_ infections have occurred after close contact with dogs, especially animals that recently aborted or gave birth, or after exposure to large amounts of the organism in laboratories. However, there have also been clinical cases where the source of the organism could not be determined. [It is possible these cases may have come from infected dogs (either known or unknown infection status) where the owner cleaned up urine from the affected pet. - Mod.TG] There are no reports of person-to-person transmission of _B. canis_, although this is theoretically possible. For other species of _Brucella_, routes implicated in rare instances of human-to-human transmission include blood transfusion, bone marrow transplantation, exposure to contaminated material while assisting at a delivery, sexual intercourse, and nursing (infants). There is no indication that members of the genus _Brucella_ are transmitted between people by casual contact under ordinary conditions. http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/brucellosis_canis.pdf

While documented human cases of _B. canis_ are rare and may be underreported, immunocompromised people should be especially careful around animals known to be positive for _B. canis_.

_Brucella canis_ in dogs is not common, but nor is it rare. Gerald Hoff found that 4 percent of Florida pound dogs had positive titres of 1:200 or higher (see Brucella canis, dogs, retrospective - USA (Florida) 19980518.0954).

Human beings may be at risk of infection from dogs having the infection, and the owner may or may not realize the dog has the infection. While the article indicates there may be a bigger risk to human beings than has previously been acknowledged, then it must also acknowledge there are more infected canines than previously recognized. Perhaps with heightened awareness a snap test (rapid test for veterinary in-clinic use) will soon be on the market. - Mod.TG
