A 57-year-old German woman, resident of Venao beach in the Pedasi district, Los Santos province, died as a victim of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome yesterday, Wed 22 Apr 2015. This was confirmed by Los Santos Regional Health Director, Nahir Cedeno.

The official explained that this patient was admitted on Sun 19 Apr 2015 to the Cecilio Castillero Hospital in Chitre [Herrera province], but since this facility lacks intensive care capacity, she was taken on Tue 21 Apr 2015 to the Joaquin Pablo Franco Sayas Hospital in Las Tablas [capital of Los Santos province].

This patient is the 2nd victim of the disease in Los Santos province, where, so far this year [2015], 12 people have had illness due to [a] hantavirus [infection], she added.

[Los Santos province is endemic for Choclo hantavirus. No data on this or the previous cases include an indication of which hantavirus is responsible. Choclo is the only 1 of the 3 hantaviruses known to be endemic in Panama that causes hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. In the report above, no mention is made of the ecological setting in which the infection occurred, nor if epidemiological field studies were done or were planned at the site where the patient lived.

The preventive measures indicated in previous reports include elimination of sites attractive to rodents. The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents occur in and around agricultural areas and adjacent houses and buildings.
