With 585 outbreaks and almost 900 dead animals, the bluetongue epidemic runs fast in Sardinia. Vaccinations are late and today [8 Sep 2021], during the joint session of the Health and Productive Activities commissions of the Regional Council, we tried to understand the reasons. One, in particular, is linked to a short circuit in the communication between the Department of Health and ATS ["Azienda Tutela della Salute", Health protection agency] with the former, more than 4 months ago, urging the latter to provide for the administration, without receiving any feedback.

On 5 May 2021, the director of the regional veterinary service, Antonio Montisci, wrote a letter to the management of ATS Sardinia inviting it to employ the necessary staff in prophylaxis measures. "Taking into account that the vaccination activity to be carried out will have to be concentrated in the farms and territories identified based on risk" -- the letter reads -- "precisely to ensure the timely performance of prophylaxis activities in those at greatest risk, this direction is invited to wanting to adopt the appropriate measures necessary to optimize the use of the personnel in charge in these areas." However, from today's [8 Sep 2021] session of the commission, it emerges that the ATS has never replied to this note from Montisci. In the meantime, the outbreaks reached 585, most of them concentrated in the territories of the Asl di Nuoro (337), Oristano (98), and Lanusei (70). Followed by Sassari (38), Cagliari (35), Olbia (4), and Sanluri (3). In addition, there are 12 598 clinical cases of infected sheep and 898 deaths. Numbers presented today by the general directorate of the department during the joint meeting of the 2 commissions.

According to the information above, BTV4 has already spread throughout most of Sardinia's regions.

The significantly increased spreading rate of the epizootic in Sardinia is reflected in the number of officially reported outbreaks in 2021: 16 Aug -- 26 outbreaks; 25 Aug -- 104, 27 Aug -- 177, 8 Sep -- 585 (see 20210831.8634693).

The Sarda local breed of dairy sheep, which counted 2 317 000 lactating ewes as of 31 Dec 2019 (more than 30% of the sheep in the whole of Italy), is known to be highly susceptible to bluetongue.
