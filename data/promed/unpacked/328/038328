Follow-up: outbreak reported in Surrey
-----------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY: Latest news on the FMD outbreak reported in Surrey:
* Early today the European Commission released a
statement about the outbreak stating: "The
Commission will adopt on Monday an emergency
decision confirming the measures being applied in
accordance with EC legislation, concerning
restrictions on the movement of animals and the
dispatch of products from the UK."
* Speaking on Radio 4`s Today programme Peter
Kendall, the president of the National Farmers
Union, said the farming industry would not oppose
the use of vaccination of livestock if that was
the scientific advice. He said: "Certainly as an
industry we would not stand in any way to object
to vaccination if the scientists deem it the right way of moving forward."
* Cobra, the Government`s emergency committee,
was set to meet today [Sat, 4 Aug 2007] at 9am.
* Although the farm`s exact location has not been
disclosed, a map on Defra`s website shows the
centre of the protection zone between Farnborough
and Aldershot. [See page 3 of the pdf document
available at
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/fmd/pdf/declaration-pz-sz-rz-070803.pdf>.
- Mod. AS].
* Three major agricultural shows in Scotland are
going ahead this weekend without cows, sheep and
goats, due to foot-and-mouth restrictions.
* Scientists are carrying out tests to determine
whether the virus reached Britain through the
illegal movement of animals, on the wind or by
accidental contamination. ``The laboratory tests
are already under way and the earliest possible
information will probably come during the later
part of today,`` said the country`s chief veterinarian, Debby Reynolds.

Foot and Mouth Disease confirmed in cattle, in Surrey
----------------
Following an investigation of suspected vesicular
disease by Animal Health on a holding near
Guildford in Surrey, laboratory results on Friday
evening, [3 Aug 2007] indicated the presence of
the Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) virus in samples from cattle on the premises.
On the basis of the initial laboratory results
Debby Reynolds, UK Chief Veterinary Officer
confirmed Foot and Mouth Disease. In accordance
with the legislation and contingency planning
arrangements all the cattle on the premises would
be culled. A Protection Zone of 3 kilometres
radius and a Surveillance Zone of 10 kilometres
has been placed around the premises, and a GB
wide national movement ban of all ruminants and pigs has been imposed.
Nationally no animal movements are allowed except
under licence, controls are in place on movement
of animal carcasses, animal gatherings, shearing
and dipping are restricted, and all farms must
increase levels of biosecurity. In both the
Protection and Surveillance Zones, there will be
requirements for increased levels of biosecurity
on farms, movement controls, controls on
transportation of dung/manure and treatment of
animal products to ensure destruction of the FMD virus.
The farm itself has been under restrictions since
late on Thursday evening [2 Aug 2007] when
symptoms were reported to the local Animal Health
office. A 1km temporary restriction zone was
placed around the premises earlier today whilst
investigations and testing were completed, in
line with domestic and EU legislation.
The European Commission has been informed.
Further information
* Advice from the Health Protection Agency
(HPA) is that foot and mouth disease is not a
direct public health threat. The Food Standards
Agency considers that foot and mouth disease has
no implications for the human food chain.
* Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) is a disease
of cattle and very few human cases have ever been
recorded even though the disease is endemic in
animals in many parts of the world including
Asia, Africa, the Middle East and South America.
Foot and mouth disease only crosses the species
barrier from cattle to human with very great
difficulty. The last human case reported in
Britain occurred in 1966. The disease in humans,
in the very rare cases that have occurred, is
mild, short-lived and requires no medical treatment.
* The movement of animals, animal products,
feed and bedding in the zones will be
prohibited, except under license. Products from
animals in these zones will be subject to
treatment to ensure destruction of the FMD virus.
This is an animal health measure rather than a
public health measure. Such treatments include
the pasteurisation of milk (normal process for
most milk produced in the UK), heat treatment or
de-boning and maturation of meat in certain circumstances.
* The exact details on the measures that
apply in Protection and Surveillance Zones can be
found on the Defra website at:
* Export health certificates for animals and
animal products will be withdrawn. Exports from
GB of susceptible animals during the risk period
will be identified and notified to the importing countries.

[One of the main conditions for successful
containment and eradication of the outbreak is
timely and complete backward and forward tracing
of contact animals. The virus has been
circulating within the affected premises during a
certain period before being suspected and
subsequently confirmed; the duration of that
period (which is, in practical terms, never
shorter than 10 days but could be much longer),
should be determined and all possible contacts
traced. Determining the age of the FMD
lesions is a useful aid to determining the
approximate time of first infection and of the
period during which the virus could have spread
to other sites before the visible onset of disease.
We wish DEFRA success in this crucial
undertaking, and look forward to the pathogen's typing. - Mod.AS]
