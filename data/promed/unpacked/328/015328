Fate of Launceston's monkeys to be known soon
----------------------------------------------
The fate of Launceston's City Park monkeys should be known in 2 weeks. The
city council must decide whether the primates, which carry a disease
potentially fatal in humans, should be destroyed.
Routine testing has revealed the herpes-B virus, which has little effect on
the monkeys but can cause encephalitis, or swelling of the brain, in humans.
Veterinarian Tony English says the way the monkeys are handled by council
workers makes it unlikely the disease could be transferred. He says the
risk to visitors is even lower.
Dr English says the virus can only be transferred between animals and
humans if the monkeys are "shedding", or exhibiting symptoms of the
disease, and he says Launceston's monkeys appear healthy.

[The virus is only dangerous if the non-human primates are shedding the
virus. It would seem the occasional bite is the means of transmission and
as these monkeys appear healthy, there is little risk to the handlers.
Protective clothing minimizes the risk. - Mod.TG

[Shedding of the virus and "exhibiting symptoms of the disease" are two
different things. Viral shedding can occur in healthy monkeys.
Cercopithecine herpesvirus 1 (herpesvirus simiae or B-virus) must be
considered in people who have received bites, scratches, or mucosal contact
with saliva from Asiatic macaques, especially from the rhesus monkey, _M.
mulatta_. Although cercopithecine herpesvirus 1 is common in all macaque
species, in every documented human infection in which the exposure could be
traced to a macaque or to macaque tissues, patients had exposure to rhesus
monkeys, _M. mulatta_. An interesting published report suggests that there
are distinct genotypes of cercopithecine herpesvirus 1, and that the
isolates from different species vary in their pathogenicity for humans.

Are these rhesus monkeys? -Man. Ed. DS
