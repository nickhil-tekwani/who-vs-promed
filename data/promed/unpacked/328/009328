The Camden County (NJ) Department of Health and Human Services reported an eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) case in a resident of Pine Hill.

On [21 Sep 2021], laboratory test results positive for EEE were reported to the Camden County Department of Health and Human Services. The patient remains hospitalized.

"Eastern equine encephalitis is transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito. Only a few human cases are reported each year, and the disease can't be passed directly from person to person," said Commissioner Carmen Rodriguez, liaison to the Health Department. "The Camden County Department of Health is continuing to work with the Mosquito Commission to ensure that additional spraying and testing will be conducted in the area."

Symptoms of EEE include, but are not limited to, a sudden onset of high fever, stiff neck, lack of energy, general muscle pain, and a headache increasing in severity.

The best way to protect yourself from mosquitoes is to use insect repellent. Use Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellents with one of the active ingredients below. When used as directed, EPA-registered insect repellents are proven safe and effective, even for pregnant and breastfeeding women.

- DEET
- picaridin (known as KBR 3023 and icaridin outside the US)
- IR3535
- oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE)
- para-menthane-diol (PMD)
- 2-undecanone

[Human EEE cases occur sporadically in the eastern USA, including New Jersey. There were 3 equine EEE cases earlier this year (2021) in Atlantic County, New Jersey. The CDC summary of human New Jersey cases from 2010 to 2019 reports 1 case in 2016 and 4 cases in 2019 (https://www.cdc.gov/easternequineencephalitis/tech/epi.html). The case above is the 1st one since then.

EEE, although rare, can be a serious disease. The CDC notes, "Approximately 1/3 of all people with encephalitis due to EEEV infection die. Death usually occurs 2 to 10 days after onset of symptoms but can occur much later. Of those who recover, many are left with physical or mental sequelae, which can range from mild brain dysfunction to severe intellectual impairment, personality disorders, seizures, paralysis, and cranial nerve dysfunction. Many patients with severe sequelae require long-term care and die within a few years."

Although there is a commercial EEE vaccine available for equine animals, there is no vaccine for humans. The only preventive measure is avoidance of mosquito bites. - Mod.TY
