Severe dengue outbreak kills 12 in Thailand
-------------------------------------------
Thailand, where mosquitoes are a pest in every home, is facing a severe
outbreak of dengue fever, with 12 people dead so far this year [2005],
almost double the toll a year earlier, a health official said on Thursday
[12 May 2005].
Dengue has infected 7200 people as of 7 May 2005, of whom 12 have died, up
from 7 deaths in the same period last year, Department of Disease Control
chief Thawat Suntrajarn told Reuters.
"No province in Thailand is immune from dengue outbreaks, because we have
mosquitoes everywhere," Thawat said, adding the outbreak usually peaks
between late June and July when wet season rains are the heaviest.
The tropical disease made headlines this week [2nd week May 2005] when
thousands of people queued at hospitals in Bangkok to donate blood for a 13
year old sufferer. The boy died on Wednesday [11 May 2005] after suffering
internal bleeding for nearly a week.
The disease -- which killed 176 of 114 800 infected people in 2002 -- is
characterized by high fever, rash, headaches, and severe muscle and joint pain.

Thai doctors investigate death of young dengue fever victim
-----------------------------------------------------------
Doctors are carrying out a forensic investigation into the death of a
teenage boy who died of dengue fever in a Bangkok hospital this week [2nd
week May 2005]. His parents donated his body for research into the
mosquitoborne disease in the hope that the study will help lead to the
development of a vaccine to save millions of children.
The 13 year old sufferer was pronounced dead at Bangkok's Ramathibordhi
Hospital on Wednesday [11 May 2005] night after days of treatment. His
parents decided to donate his body to Mahidol University's Vaccine
Development Center for the study. "The center will analyze which strain of
the dengue virus killed the boy. We'll also be looking to see if it's a new
strain, even though we know mutations are extremely rare," center director
Dr Suthee Yoksan said. "We can't ignore any possibility, because dengue
fever is endemic in both Thailand and Indonesia," he said.
Dr Suthee said the study could take a year or more. He described it as the
world's most in-depth study on dengue fever in 25 years and as inspired
medical research. "We thank the boy's parents for allowing the doctors to
carry out a forensic study on his body. We'll be looking at the mechanism
of the virus once it infects a victim and to see which organs are major
targets," he said.
Dr Suthee said he hoped the study would eventually lead to the development
of an effective vaccine against the disease and help save the lives of
millions of children. He said the center would coordinate with other
international organizations that are trying to develop a vaccine and would
apply for research funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
Earlier this week [2nd week May 2005], the Public Health Ministry reported
some 6000 Thais had been infected with dengue fever so far this year
[2005], most of them young children.

[This is a very touching story in that the parents of the young dengue
hemorrhagic fever victim generously donated their child's body for
research, hoping to find the etiology of the disease and to produce an
effective vaccine. The season for dengue fever has just started. Among 7200
cases as of 7 May 2005, 12 deaths have been reported in Thailand. The
outbreaks usually peak between late June and July, when wet season rains
are heaviest. - Mod.RY]

Ministry sets up 24 hour dengue fever hotline
---------------------------------------------
The Department of Disease Control has set up a 24-hour telephone helpline
in the fight against the latest outbreak of dengue fever.
With dengue fever having claimed the lives of 14 people this year [2005],
with another 7000 ill with the mosquitoborne disease, the department has
established a helpline with information on symptoms of the illness and how
to control it.
The issue of dengue fever is close to the heart of prime minister Thaksin
Shinawatra, who today [Sat 14 May 2005] revealed that his younger brother
had died of the disease, aged 25. Although the disease is rarely fatal in
adults, the prime minister said that a misdiagnosis of his brother's
condition had contributed to his untimely death. In its early stages,
dengue fever is easy to confuse with ordinary influenza, but within a few
days, a patient may be experiencing internal hemorrhaging.

Concern over dengue fever outbreak in Nakhon Sri Thammarat
----------------------------------------------------------
The chief medical officer of the southern province of Nakhon Si Thammarat
today [Sat 14 May 2005] expressed concern over latest outbreak of dengue
fever there, which has already claimed the life of one patient and left
another 378 receiving treatment.
Dr Nopporn Chuenklin, who called for officials to help control the
mosquitoborne disease, said that most of the cases were in children aged
6-13 years.
The disease is said to be particularly prevalent in Thung Song and Na Bon
districts, where officials are working to spray insecticide around schools
and houses.

City suburb hit by dengue outbreak
----------------------------------
A dengue fever outbreak has struck Townsville. The potentially fatal virus,
carried by "the cockroach of all mosquitoes", has no vaccine and no cure.
After a Currajong man in his 40s was found ill with dengue yesterday [Fri
13 May 2005], all homes within 200 meters of his home were inspected by
authorities and homeowners alerted to the dangers.
Dengue does not naturally occur in North Queensland, but the dengue
mosquito is common, and outbreaks can occur when the virus is transmitted
to the local mosquito population by infected international travelers or
residents.
Health authorities yesterday [Fri 13 May 2005] said the man had been bitten
in Townsville. They warned residents to take precautions.
Queensland Health Tropical Public Health Unit Environmental Health Service
Acting director Damien Farrington urged residents to take immediate action
to eradicate dengue. "There is no medical cure for dengue fever and no
vaccine," he said. "The serious form of the disease, dengue hemorrhagic
fever, can be fatal, especially in young children."
There were 58 cases in Townsville in the 2003-04 outbreak. Experts are
working together to conduct house to house inspections and mosquito
eradication. "It's the cockroach of the mosquitoes, because it really only
lives around peoples' homes," Mr Farrington said. "In this case, we are
still waiting on more tests to find out what type it is."
There are 4 types of dengue viruses: 1, 2, 3 and 4. Anyone infected with
one type of dengue will only be immune to that type and will be at risk of
developing severe symptoms if they contract another type.
A far northern woman died from dengue last year [2004]. In 1992-93, there
was an epidemic in Townsville with 900 people infected. Infected residents
may have no symptoms or experience a mild fever.
Dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome can be fatal. All
patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever need to be taken to the hospital for
fluid therapy and monitoring. Townsville City Council staff are working
closely with mosquito control experts to conduct house inspections and
mosquito eradications.
