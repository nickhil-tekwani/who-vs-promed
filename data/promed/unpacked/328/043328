"Because of the stability of the virus in the environment and highly contagious nature, strict biosecurity measures and good hygiene are essential in protecting against disease outbreaks.

"Measures include:
- Keep poultry away from areas frequented by wild fowl
- Do not keep on the premises elements that may attract wild birds, including poultry feed products placed outside the building
- Maintain strict control over access to flocks by vehicles, people and equipment
- Ensure the sanitation of property, poultry houses and equipment
- Avoid the introduction of birds of unknown disease status into the flock
- Report any bird illnesses and deaths to the Veterinary Services
- Ensure appropriate disposal of manure, litter and dead poultry
- Vaccinate animals where appropriate"
