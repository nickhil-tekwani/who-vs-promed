A Comment on the Absence of Information on Seroprevalence
--------------------------------------------------
It would not be surprising if the clinical cases of human avian influenza
in Vietnam and Thailand represented just the tip of the iceberg of actual
infections leading to seroconversion. The Japanese findings would seem to
support this.
Consequent to the 1997 Hong Kong outbreaks of highly pathogenic influenza A
(H5N1) among poultry, in which there were 18 documented human cases, a
cohort study of 293 Hong Kong government workers who participated in a
poultry culling operation and of 1525 poultry workers found that among
government workers [was carried out]. 3 percent were seropositive and 1
seroconversion was documented. Among poultry workers, approximately 10
percent had anti-H5 antibody. (Bridges CB, Lim W, Hu-Primmer J, Sims L,
Fukuda K, Mak KH, Rowe T, Thompson WW, Conn L, Lu X, Cox NJ, Katz JM. Risk
of influenza A (H5N1) infection among poultry workers, Hong Kong,
1997-1998. J Infect Dis. 2002 Apr 15;185(8):1005-10.)
Although the information on the seropositivity of the Japanese workers who
were exposed in 2004 is scant, it would also support the contention that
when H5N1 infects humans, it does not always cause mortality or serious
morbidity. Mortality or serious morbidity may be in actuality constitute
the minority of outcomes. The mortality proportion of 73 percent in
Thailand and Vietnam appears to be in severe infections that have led to
hospitalisation. What is the mortality proportion of all infections?
It is really an unfortunate situation that as of yet, no indexed published
literature has emerged on any human seroprevalence studies for the highly
pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) in Vietnam or Thailand. Have any such
surveys actually been conducted?

[An answer to the question posed in the last paragraph of Dr. Taha's
comment is clearly relevant to interpretation of the epidemiology of human
cases of avian influenza virus infection in Japan in particular and in East
Asia in general. Clarification would be welcomed. - Mod.CP]
