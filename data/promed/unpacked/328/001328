--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data on new-onset type 1 diabetes during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) pandemic, particularly in children, is limited. A recent US multicenter study reported outcomes in 64 adults and children with type 1 diabetes, and confirmed or suspected COVID-19. However, only 6 patients presented with new-onset type 1 diabetes (1).

We report multicenter regional data from North West London (NWL) of new onset type 1 diabetes and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in children up to the age of 16 years during the peak of the COVID19 pandemic. We collected data from 5 inpatient units (4 National Health Service [NHS] Trusts) comprising the NWL Pediatric Diabetes Network between [23 Mar 2020] (coinciding with the commencement of the UK Government lockdown) and [4 Jun 2020].

Thirty children aged 23 months to 16.8 years presented with new-onset type 1 diabetes (Table 1). We observed an apparent increase in 2 units, with 10 cases each (versus typically 2 and 4 cases, respectively, for April/May combined in the previous 5 years). Rates in the other 3 units were similar to previous years. A high proportion of children (21/30, 70%) presented with DKA, with severe DKA (pH range 6.82-7.05) in over half (11/21, 52%). 12 children presented with clinical shock and 4 were managed in pediatric intensive care. 1 children presented with reduced conscious level, one received hyperosmolar therapy, and both recovered without complications. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) PCR was performed from nasopharyngeal swabs in 21 children meeting local testing criteria; 2 tested positive. SARS-CoV-2 serum IgG antibody was tested in a subgroup of children attending one of 2 units; 3 of 16 children (19%) tested positive. Of the 5 children with positive results, 3 presented with severe DKA and refractory hypokalemia, and one child with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR suffered a hypokalemia-related cardiac arrest but recovered fully following 1 day of ventilation. Only 3 children with known type 1 diabetes presented with DKA during the same time period.

In comparison with a typical year, we estimate this represents an additional 12-15 new type 1 diabetes cases (80% increase) during the COVID-19 pandemic, with apparent clusters of cases observed in 2 units. The angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor is the binding site for SARS-CoV-1 and -2 (2) and is strongly expressed in pancreatic endocrine cells (3). Previous evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-1 virus may have entered pancreatic islet cells via the ACE2 receptor leading to beta-cell damage and new-onset, mainly transient diabetes (3). While our data does not prove a link, we postulate that SARS-CoV-2 exposure contributed to the observed increase in cases by precipitating or accelerating type 1 diabetes onset.

Reports from China and Italy describe a number of children presenting with new onset type 1 diabetes or severe DKA during the COVID-19 pandemic, apparently unrelated to infection (4). This prompted concerns of delayed presentation, but we suggest that a number of these cases may be attributed to prior SARSCoV-2 exposure. In accordance with previous reports, we observed a high rate of severe DKA, but delayed presentation did not appear to be a significant factor with relatively short symptom duration in the majority of children.

SARS-CoV-2 also affects the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system through reduced ACE2 expression, leading to decreased degradation of angiotensin II and increased secretion of aldosterone and renal potassium loss (5). Although hypokalemia is not uncommon during treatment of DKA, particularly in cases of renal impairment, it is possible that reduction in ACE2 expression may have contributed in the reported cases.

Five children tested positive for SARSCoV-2 PCR or IgG, but testing was not universal across NWL, and 14 children did not have SARS-CoV-2 IgG testing. This limited our ability to identify possible cases, particularly in children with recent suspected symptoms or known COVID-19 contacts. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 serology was tested soon after diagnosis and did not report IgM, and as antibody responses may not develop until 14-21 days post infection, further cases may have been missed.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the 1st report to describe an apparent increase in new-onset type 1 diabetes in children during the COVID-19 pandemic, with evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection or exposure in a proportion of those tested. Our intention is to raise awareness of a possible link between SARS-CoV-2 and new-onset type 1 diabetes, especially as there are reports of incident type 1 diabetes occurring as apparently small localized outbreaks. Further studies are required to establish a definitive link and any possible impact on the severity of type 1 diabetes presentation, including severe hypokalemia.

[Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease where the target of the immune response are the beta islet cells of the pancreas. Viral etiologies for type 1 diabetes childhood presentation have been hypothesized to be associated with viral infections, in particular enteroviral infections in the child or in the mother during gestation, where infection with the viral agent leads to a hyperimmune response targeting the beta islet cells or perhaps leads to a direct cytolytic action of the beta islet cells. While coronaviruses have not been implicated as yet, given the hyperimmune responses in some individuals with infection with the SARS-CoV-2, a possible association of new onset of type 1 diabetes with infection seems worthy of further investigation.

[2] Shifting age distribution
Date: Tue 18 Aug 2020 1:21 AM GMT+2

https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/who-warns-young-people-are-emerging-as-main-spreaders-of-the-coronavirus/2020/08/18/1822ee92-e18f-11ea-b69b-64f7b0477ed4_story.html


The World Health Organization warned Tuesday [18 Aug 2020] that young people are becoming the primary drivers of the spread of the novel coronavirus in many countries -- a worrisome trend experts fear may grow in the United States as many colleges and schools begin to reopen. Many nations in Asia, which had previously pushed infections to enviably low rates, have experienced surges in recent weeks at the same time that the age of those infected skewed younger. "People in their 20s, 30s, and 40s are increasingly driving the spread," Takeshi Kasai, the WHO's Western Pacific regional director, said at a news briefing on Tuesday. "The epidemic is changing."

More than half of confirmed infections in Australia and the Philippines in recent weeks have been in people younger than 40, WHO officials said, a stark contrast to predominantly older patients from the previous months. In Japan, 65 percent of recent infections occurred in people below age 40. Because symptoms are often milder in the young, Kasai noted, many are unaware they are infected. "This increases the risk of spillovers to the most vulnerable: the elderly, the sick, people in long-term care, people who live in densely populated urban areas and underserved rural areas," Kasai said.

The global health agency's warnings come amid intense debate in the United States about whether to bring students back to classrooms. So far, at least 168 000 people in the United States have died of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, according to a Washington Post analysis. For colleges and universities, where students in their late teens and 20s live in tight quarters and mingle at off-campus gatherings, the problem has proved particularly vexing. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill confidently reopened campus last week [10 Aug 2020] with social distancing measures, including leaving dorms partially vacant and blocking off chairs in lecture halls so students had to sit farther apart. But abruptly, on Monday [17 Aug 2020], the school decided to close again when 177 students tested positive for the virus, as outbreaks sprang up in residence halls and a fraternity house.

Other colleges are reporting similarly concerning numbers. On Tuesday [18 Aug 2020], the University of Notre Dame announced that it will halt in-person teaching for at least 2 weeks after reporting that 147 people had tested positive since [3 Aug 2020]. Michigan State University also said Tuesday [18 Aug 2020] that it will shift to remote learning for the fall semester after 187 people in surrounding East Lansing were linked to an outbreak at a college bar in July [2020]. At least 189 people at the University of Kentucky have tested positive for the virus since [3 Aug 2020], according to the university's website, representing a little more than 1 percent of those tested.

But public universities in several states are forging ahead with plans to fully reopen campuses, including those in Georgia and Florida, which have among the highest infection rates in the nation. While unwilling to close those campuses, governors in Texas and Florida in recent weeks have instituted limits on bars and alcohol consumption, citing the skyrocketing number of young people who are contracting the virus. The actions came after videos of packed bars and crowded house parties with no partygoers wearing masks put several college towns on high alert.

An analysis by Davidson College in North Carolina that examined 2 public institutions in every state found that 23 planned some kind of in-person instruction. Experts say they are doing so in the face of stark warning signs of a potentially hazardous fall term ahead. California's public colleges and universities have decided to conduct most classes virtually. Several others, including Brown University and the University of Maryland, had planned to open but abruptly reversed course before the start of the school year.

Four major college athletic conferences -- the Big Ten, the Pacific-12, the Mid-American Conference, and the Mountain West -- have canceled fall seasons to protect players and other students who would normally crowd into stadiums and arenas for games.

Students at several US universities have staged "die-in" demonstrations -- socially distanced on the grass with mock tombstones -- to protest the reopening, amid concerns that in-person teaching may result in rapid spread of the coronavirus on campuses. In recent days, such protests have unfolded at Elon University in North Carolina, Georgia Tech, the University of Arizona, the University of Georgia and Virginia Commonwealth University.

Meanwhile, K-12 schools face similar issues. Schools in Georgia, Mississippi, and Tennessee that reopened this month [August 2020] had to shutter or change course when students or staff tested positive for the coronavirus, forcing thousands to quarantine. The closures have raised fears among educators who are set to return to school this month [August 2020], including in Florida, where the state has mandated nearly every school system to open its doors. There, the state's largest teachers union has sued Gov Ron DeSantis (R), an ally of President Trump who has been repeatedly criticized for sidelining scientists and public health officials.

Many students throughout the country returned to classrooms this month [August 2020] only to have plans for in-person instruction derailed when students or staff tested positive or had to quarantine. In Mississippi, at least 2035 students and 589 teachers have been ordered to quarantine because of possible coronavirus exposure, state officials said Monday [17 Aug 2020]. Those numbers came after some schools restarted in-person instruction Monday, while others had not yet resumed classes. In Arizona, one school district voted to reopen but had to cancel all classes Monday [17 Aug 2020] because many teachers refused to show up.

In a 2nd news conference Tuesday [18 Aug 2020] that took place in Geneva, WHO officials warned school systems to proceed cautiously but also pleaded with young people not to indulge in increasingly risky behavior as the pandemic persists. "We just need to make sure the message is getting out, particularly to young people, particularly to children and young adults, that you are not invulnerable to this and you can get infected," said Maria Van Kerkhove, head of the WHO's emerging disease and zoonosis unit. "We are seeing young people who are dying from this virus."

In the United States, the virus has exacted a disproportionate toll on children of color. Hispanic children are about 8 times more likely and Black children 5 times more likely to be hospitalized with COVID-19 than their White peers, according to a study released this month [August 2020] by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

[In European countries the shift in age distribution has similarly decreased. There seems to be a consistent pattern in many countries in Europe and Asia, as well as in Australia, the USA, and Canada, that the 20s-40s age groups have been associated with increased infections, not unrelated to parties and drinking in bars. Media reports consistently show photographs of large groups at beaches, bars (outdoors where indoor service is not permitted), in large crowds, no masks, and not observing social distancing. It is the age of perceived invincibility and the realization that they can be infected without symptoms and infect parents, grandparents, other relatives, and co-workers when they don't have symptoms just hasn't penetrated their consciousness. - Mod.MPP]

[These countries had been selected based on having had significant surges of SARS-CoV-2 infections but different responses. In some cases, transmission was almost interrupted, but resurgences have occurred, and countries have handled them differently. One observation is that lifting of restrictions has led to major resurgences in some areas; in others, early new threats seem to be importations, but community spread does recur. Good contact tracing has helped to shorten the time with new clusters, and temporary new restrictions have had an impact. Countries not implementing restrictions have done more poorly, with major resurgences and more widespread community-based transmission.

In South Korea, it looks like major transmission is beginning. Previously, when there were major events, time-limited increased restrictions were implemented. A key takeaway message is that the virus is still circulating globally, and relaxing of the guard (eliminating simple measures of social distancing, face masks, hand washing, and large gatherings) is an open invitation for the virus to re-enter with clusters of cases and ultimately community transmission. - Mod.MPP]

The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215. Data by country, area, or territory can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesAug18_1597791356.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 51.2% of daily case numbers and 51.3% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours. maintaining its dominance as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 11.6 million cases. The USA and Brazil continue to dominate followed by Colombia, Peru, Argentina, and Mexico.

- The European region reported 8.1% of daily case numbers and 12.3% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours and a total cumulative cases reported greater than 3.7 million. Russia continues its dominance followed by Ukraine, Turkey, Israel, Sweden, Romania, and the UK.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 5.7% of daily case numbers and 8.4% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of greater than 1.7 million cases. Iraq continues to dominate, followed by Iran, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Kuwait, and Pakistan.

- The African region reported 3.4% of daily case numbers and 4.8% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.9 million cases. South Africa continues to dominate followed by Ethiopia, Zambia, Algeria, and Nigeria.

- The Western Pacific region reported 2.5% of daily case numbers and 1.3% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.4 million cases. The Philippines continues to dominate followed by Japan, Australia, and South Korea. Viet Nam and New Zealand continue to report newly confirmed cases following the new outbreaks identified in the few weeks.

- The South East Asia region reported 29.2% of the daily newly reported cases and 21.8% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 3.1 million cases. India continues to be the driving force of the dominance of this region followed by Bangladesh and Indonesia.

Impression: The overall picture is basically the same. The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed on a daily basis followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, followed by the Africa region, and the Western Pacific region representing the lowest daily caseload of all the regions. While regional proportions may not reflect this, most of the regions have countries with resurgences associated with lifting of restrictions.

On the overview tab at the WHO source URL, the epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases by WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 18 Aug 2020, is the same epidemic curve included in the previous situation updates and is an excellent visual representation of the epidemic as described in the text above. - Mod.MPP]

[The USA, Brazil, and India are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations. In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (65 022), followed by Brazil (48 637), and the USA (43 947) -- account for over half of all confirmed cases globally (53.1%). There were 7199 deaths reported in the past 24 hours (16 Aug 2020).

In descending rank order, India is number one for the number of newly confirmed in the past 24 hours, followed by Brazil, USA, Peru, Colombia, Argentina, Mexico, Russia, Philippines, and Iraq. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed goes from 4576 to 65 022. Other hotspots are seen in the countries numbered 11-20 in this list: Bangladesh, Bolivia, Iran, South Africa, France, Spain, Venezuela, Indonesia, Israel, and Ukraine; their range of reported new cases is 1616 to 3200. A total of 31 countries have reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is virtually no change in average number of daily reported cases (a decrease of 1.3%), and looking at daily reported deaths, the change is decreased by 6.6%. The key question still remains as to whether transmission is in fact slowing down or whether these figures reflect reporting artefact seen surrounding weekends. Time will tell, but following the data reports showing major surges in countries that had been showing successes makes one wonder what is driving these reporting variances (We haven't changed our minds! -- We feel like a broken record here...).

Impression: The SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts and mortality, while the global 7-day averages seem to reflect a slowing down of reporting confirmed cases; however, I still wonder whether this is real or reflects a changing pattern with decreased testing or case reporting. For example, the USA reported data suggest a slowing down of transmission over the past 2 weeks as seen by the comparative 7-day averages in reported new cases (see section [3E] above), but if one looks at the percentage of positive PCR tests, in the past 2 weeks the positivity rate has been stable at 9%, consistent with significant ongoing transmission that is not abating (see https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html). The most severely affected region is the Americas, with increasing daily case counts, even though the comparative 7-day average suggests things may be slowing down (or reporting is slowing down). India also drives the next most affected region -- South East Asia -- with persistent high daily case reports. - Mods.UBA/MPP]
