European Influenza Surveillance Scheme database suggests west-east spread
of influenza across Europe
-----------------------------------------------
An analysis of data collected by the European Influenza Surveillance Scheme
(EISS, <http://www.eiss.org>) during the past 5 winters (1999 to 2004)
reveals a possible west-east spread of influenza across Europe (1). In 3 of
the 5 winters (2003/2004, 2002/2003, 2001/2002), the analysis suggests that
there was west-east spread and during one of these seasons (2001/2002)
there was also a south-north spread [figure, not shown here, shows the peak
week of clinical activity versus the longitude of each country: 2003/2004
season].
More detailed mapping analyses are needed to confirm these findings, and
EISS will initiate a European Mapping Project, based on a collaborative
mapping project between Germany and the Netherlands (2), to further explore
these questions and to improve the presentation of influenza activity each
winter. The current objective is to provide this new mapping data on the
EISS website during the 2005/2006 season.
The analysis also found that clinical activity (usually cases of
influenza-like illness, but occasionally cases of acute respiratory
infection) reported by sentinel physicians and collected by EISS is a valid
indicator of influenza activity and that, for Europe as a whole, increased
influenza activity lasts for 10 to 22 weeks (2 to 5 months) each season.
The long period of increased influenza activity and the possibility of a
west-east spread may have important consequences for influenza pandemic
planning in Europe. For example, these findings could help with the
planning and efficient allocation of resources (such as antivirals and
vaccines) in Europe before and during a pandemic.
