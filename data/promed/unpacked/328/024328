referred to the Unit for further investigation in the year in
question. CJD may be no more than suspected; about half the cases
referred in the past have turned out not to be CJD.

Britain confirms 16 human "mad cow" cases

LONDON (Reuter) - [MHJ - This report adds little to the information provided
above which Reuters obtained from the same source and then claimed
copyright. However, they also noted:]

One case of the new variant has been reported in France.

CJD normally strikes about one in a million. There were 57
cases in Britain last year.

[That makes one per million by my math - Mod.JW]
