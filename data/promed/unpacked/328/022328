Following more than 8 reports of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE)
recently, agriculture and forestry commissioner Bob Odom is reminding horse
owners to vaccinate their horses. Odom said EEE has been identified as the
cause of death in 8 horses and suspected in 2 others in Lafourche Parish
[Louisiana].
"Since there is no cure for eastern equine encephalitis, I am urging horse
owners to vaccinate their animals," Odom said. "This is a very preventable
disease, but often horse owners wait until it's too late.
"Only rarely do horses recover from eastern equine encephalitis," Odom
said. "Even when an animal doesn't die, it is almost always brain damaged
and is never usable again." Odom stressed the significance of reporting and
testing suspected horses. "This is a public health concern and we are
asking all horse owners to make sure their animals have up-to-date
vaccinations and to consult a veterinarian if their horses are displaying
any symptoms.
"It's crucial because that information is passed quickly on to other health
officials," he said. "With the public health concern over eastern equine
encephalitis and other mosquitoborne illnesses, our animal health officials
are an important link to the state and nationwide reporting systems."
Dr Henry Moreau, state veterinarian, said eastern equine encephalitis has a
mortality rate of 90 per cent. The disease causes encephalitis, or swelling
of the brain, in both horses and humans, but cannot be transmitted directly
from horses or humans to other horses and humans. The virus is transmitted
by mosquitoes in 2 ways, either from bird to bird or from bird to mammal.
Infected horses become depressed and uncoordinated, develop a sleepy
appearance, walk in circles, and eventually collapse to the ground.
Horses that have not been vaccinated should have 2 doses administered about
2 weeks apart. Once the initial vaccination has been given, an annual
booster is sufficient to maintain immunity. Owners with horses displaying
any of these symptoms should contact their local veterinarian. Any
suspected equine neuro encephalitis case should be reported even if blood
is not pulled. Eastern equine encephalitis, West Nile virus, western equine
encephalitis, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis are all reportable on
suspicion, not diagnosis, of disease symptoms.

[The vaccine for EEE is often combined with West Nile virus vaccine. It
makes it very easy to protect a horse from both diseases. These
vaccinations are required every year to keep an animal protected. - Mod.TG
