Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza In Viet Nam
-----------------------------------------------
(Date of previous outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in
Viet Nam reported to the OIE: August 2006).
Information received on 19 Dec 2006 from Dr. Bui Quang Anh, Director,
Department of Animal Health, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development, Hanoi:
Report date: 19 Dec 2006.
Reason for immediate notification: reoccurrence of a listed disease
or infection in a country or zone/compartment following a report
declaring the outbreak(s) ended.

susceptible ducks, 3550 cases and deaths in addition to 900 destroyed
and no slaughtered ducks. In Ca Mau province, there were 4500
susceptible birds, with 2523 cases and deaths in addition to 1500

[Obviously, the reoccurrence of new poultry cases in Viet Nam is a
cause of concern. This is a time where a "One Medicine" approach to
influenza disease control should be emphasized, since control in
poultry populations can help Viet Nam repeat the success of last year
(2005) in preventing human cases. Very close monitoring of the
occurrence and effective control efforts in birds will be important
for reducing the risk of spread to humans as we enter the high risk
season of the year.
The location of the outbreaks can be seen at
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/VM/73/Bac_Lieu.html> and
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/VM/77/Ca_Mau.html>.
One concern with this report is that not all the 4500 susceptible
birds at Ca Mau province identified in the report are accounted for
by the 2523 cases that died and the 1500 birds destroyed. Hopefully,
the remaining 477 birds will be explained in subsequent reports, as
it is important to ensure all possible birds are traced. In initial
outbreaks such as these, it is particularly important to confirm that
all potentially infected birds are subject to the most effective
control measures. Controlling outbreak foci before the epidemic
becomes widespread is the optimal course. In the case of Bac Lieu
province, it appears from this report that all birds either died or
were destroyed, and, therefore, this outbreak site poses a lower risk
of spread. Unfortunately, based on this report, the same cannot be
said for the outbreak in Ca Mau province, where the numbers for the
outbreak site don't add up properly. Good surveillance is critical at
this junction. - Mod.PC]
