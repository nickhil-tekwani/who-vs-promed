Rapid spread of soybean rust (_Phakopsora pachyrhizi_) in the Americas:
addition to the EPPO Alert List
-------------------------------
2 distinct pathogens are involved in soybean rust: _Phakopsora pachyrhizi_
(Pp) and _P. meibomiae_ (Pm) (see EPPO RS 2002/030). Pr is more aggressive
and is considered as one of the most destructive foliar diseases of soybean
(_Glycine max_). Pp originates from Asia (hence its common name: Asian
soybean rust [ASR]) but in recent years, it has spread to other continents.

The 1st confirmed report of ASR on the African continent was made in 1996
from Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda, and it then continued to spread to other
African countries. ASR was first reported in Hawaii in 1994, but until very
recently it was still absent from the continental part of USA.

In South America, ASR was first detected in Paraguay in 2001, in a limited
number of fields in the Parana River basin bordering Brazil. By 2002, ASR
was widespread throughout Paraguay and in limited areas of Brazil bordering
Paraguay, with reports of severe disease in some fields in both countries.
During the 2003 growing season, ASR was detected in most of the soybean-
growing regions of Brazil with significant yield losses (approximately 5
percent of the annual production).

In Argentina, ASR was found in 2002 in a limited area in the north of the
country. In 2004, it spread readily throughout most soybean-growing areas of
northwest and northeast Argentina. In USA, ASR was first found in November
2004 in Louisiana, and later in other southeastern states. It is considered
that the rust was transported from South America to North America by
Hurricane Ivan in September 2004. There are also recent reports of the
disease in Bolivia and Uruguay.

Although it is not entirely clear whether ASR would be able to survive in
Euro-Mediterranean conditions (cold winter temperatures, lack of humidity),
a CLIMEX study did not exclude the possibility that ASR could survive in
southern Mediterranean countries. As this damaging rust of soybean is still
absent from the Euro-Mediterranean region, the EPPO Secretariat decided to
add it to the EPPO Alert List.

_Phakopsora pachyrhizi_ (Asian soybean rust)

Why: The recent and rapid spread of ASR in the Americas attracted our
attention. Although data is lacking on potential establishment in the Euro-
Mediterranean region (tropical and sub-tropical pathogen), the EPPO
Secretariat decided to add it to the EPPO Alert List.

Where:
Asia: Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Nepal,
Philippines, Russia (Far East), Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam.

Africa: Ghana, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, South Africa,
Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe.

North America: USA (Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Louisiana,
Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Tennessee).

South America: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil (Goias, Maranhao, Mato Grosso,
Mato Grosso do Sul, Minas Gerais, Parana, Rio Grande do Sul, SÃ£o Paulo),
Paraguay, Uruguay.

Oceania: Australia, Papua New Guinea.

On which plants
---------------
Soybean (_Glycine max_) is the main cultivated host, but many other
_Fabaceae_ can host this rust, for example: _Lupinus hirsutus_, _Medicago
arborea_, _Melilotus officinalis_, _Phaseolus vulgaris_, _P. lunatus_,
_Vicia dasycarpa_, _Vigna unguiculata_, and the weed _Pueraria montana_ var.
_lobata_ (kudzu). More data is needed on the range and economic importance
of Pp.on legume hosts, other than soybean.

Damage
------
The most common symptoms of infection by ASR are tan-to-dark brown or
reddish brown lesions (2 to 5 mm square) which are usually clustered along
the veins. Lesions contain erumpent, globose uredinia. Urediniospores are
released through the circular ostiole. The disease begins with small, water-
soaked lesions, which gradually increase in size, turning from grey to tan
or brown. They assume a polygonal shape restricted by leaf veins and usually
coalesce to form larger lesions. As the plant matures and sets pods, the
symptoms spread rapidly to the middle and upper parts of the plant. Lesions
are found on petioles, pods, and stems but are most abundant on leaves. As
rust severity increases, premature defoliation and early maturation of
plants is common. In areas where the pathogen occurs commonly, yield losses
up to 80 percent have been reported. Successful infection is dependent on
the availability of moisture on plant surfaces. At least 6 h of free
moisture is needed for infection, with maximum infections occurring with 10
to 12 h of free moisture. Temperatures between 15 and 28 deg C are ideal for
infection.

Dissemination
-------------
Over long distances, ASR is mainly spread by wind-borne spores (e.g. in USA,
it is considered that Hurricane Ivan transported it from South America to
Southern USA; see Internet animation:
<https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/ariatti/www/SBR/Ivan.htm>).
Trade of host plants cannot be excluded as a pathway (e.g. leafy vegetables,
ornamentals, pods).

Pathway
-------
Plants for planting, ornamental cut foliage, vegetables of host plants may
ensure dissemination of the pathogen.

Possible risks
--------------
Soybean is an important crop in the EPPO region. ASR is considered as a
serious rust disease in countries where it occurs. Control methods are
available (chemical control, destruction of weed hosts) but more data is
needed on their efficacy. Preliminary CLIMEX studies have showed that low
winter temperatures and lack of humidity are limiting factors for the
establishment of the pathogen, and therefore in Europe, only Southern
Mediterranean countries may be at risk. However, more detailed studies on
its potential for establishment would be needed for the EPPO region.

[ASR was reported on late crops of soybean and on kudzu (_Pueraria lobata_)
in several southern states in 2004. In 2005, it has so far been reported
only from Florida and Georgia. -Mod.DH]
