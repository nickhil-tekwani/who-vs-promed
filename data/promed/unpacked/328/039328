Acute hepatitis E complicated by Guillain-Barre syndrome in Portugal, December 2012
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
[A case report by: L Santos, J R Mesquita, N Rocha Pereira, C Lima-Alves, R Serrao, P Figueiredo, J Reis, J Simoes, M S Nascimento, and A Sarmento]

Summary
-------
Autochthonous hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection has been increasingly reported in Europe and the United States, mostly arising from genotype 3 and less frequently genotype 4. We report here on a patient with HEV genotype 3a infection complicated by Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) in Portugal in December 2012. We draw attention to the diagnosis of autochthonous HEV infection and to its rare, but important, neurological complications.

Serological analysis to detect hepatitis viruses was negative for all except HEV, being positive for anti-HEV IgM and negative for anti-HEV IgG, suggesting an acute infection with HEV. Serological markers for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) -- EBV nuclear antigen and viral capsid antigen IgG -- were positive, but EBV IgM was negative. The diagnosis of HEV infection was confirmed by the presence of HEV RNA in the serum sample taken the day the patient was admitted to the referring hospital. CSF [cerebrospinal fluid] and stool samples were not available at that time for testing. HEV RNA in serum was detected using a nested broad-spectrum reverse transcription PCR with amplification within the open reading frame (ORF) 1 region of HEV genome.

The amplicon obtained (330 bp) was sequenced and compared with reference HEV strains, using a neighbor-joining method based on the Jukes-Cantor model for ORF 1 nucleotide sequences of selected HEV isolates representing genotypes 1-4. This phylogenetic analysis revealed that the amplicon clustered with HEV genotype 3, specifically subgenotype 3a.

In a routine visit to the hospital 2 months after being discharged, analysis of a blood sample collected at that time showed that HEV RNA was undetectable, anti-HEV IgM was negative and anti-HEV IgG was positive.

Background
----------
In recent years, an increasing number of autochthonous infections with HEV have been reported in Europe and in United States. Most of these autochthonous cases have been caused by HEV genotype 3 (HEV3) and less frequently by genotype 4. Seroprevalence studies also show that HEV infection in the population of industrialised countries is higher than previously thought. HEV3 infections have been associated with the consumption of raw or insufficiently cooked pork, deer and wild boar and to direct contact with infected swine.

Autochthonous HEV infection is usually subclinical or runs a mild course and is self-limiting, but chronic autochthonous infection has been identified among immunocompromised persons, including organ transplant recipients, patients receiving cancer chemotherapy and persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

A broad set of symptoms of autochthonous HEV disease has been seen as well as increasing recognition of its extra-hepatic manifestations. Both acute and chronic HEV infections have been reported to be associated with muscular weakness, neurological disorders including polyradiculopathy, GBS, bilateral brachial neuritis, encephalitis or proximal myopathy. Although neurological disorders associated with HEV3 are rare, some data are emerging in literature. In recent years, a number of GBS cases associated with HEV infections have been described. GBS is an acute, acquired, autoimmune disorder of peripheral nerves that develops in susceptible individuals after infection and, in rare cases, after vaccination. In about 60 percent of cases, GBS is preceded by an infection, most frequently by _Campylobacter jejuni_, but other pathogens, such as viruses from family _Herpesviridae_ (cytomegalovirus, varicella zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus) or bacterial agents (_Haemophilus influenzae_, _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_) can be responsible.

Discussion
----------
Exhaustive tests to detect the agents mostly frequently associated with GBS, other than _Campylobacter_, gave negative results in samples from our patient. _Campylobacter_ was not tested for because of the patient's symptoms. Given the serological results, EBV was not considered likely as the causative agent. Detection of both IgM anti-HEV and HEV RNA in the patient's serum confirmed acute hepatitis E.

The actual incidence of GBS associated with HEV infection is unknown because autochthonous hepatitis E is still underdiagnosed in many industrialised countries. This is in part due to the fact that frequently HEV infection is subclinical and because the neurological findings surpass the liver injuries and hepatitis is not suspected. Hence, HEV infection should be considered in neurological diseases associated with abnormal levels of liver enzymes.

Since the patient reported no travel history, it seems likely that the HEV infection was locally acquired. We consider it most probably resulted from consumption of pork or pork products, as there is a strong tradition of pork consumption among Portuguese people and HEV3 has been detected in domestic pigs from several farms in Portugal.

Interestingly, the patient was in his late 50s. It is known that middle-aged and elderly men are more vulnerable to severe HEV3 infection, which can ultimately lead to hospitalisation and possibly death.

To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of a neurological disorder associated with an autochthonous HEV3 infection in a Portuguese patient. Considering the GBS-HEV cases reported, we recommend that testing for HEV should be included routinely in the diagnostic algorithm of GBS when liver function is altered.
