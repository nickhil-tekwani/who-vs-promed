Regarding the recent recall of eggs in Australia, salmonellosis rates in
this country have been increasing since the 1970s: see
<http://exhibit.gideononline.com/salm.aust.jpg>.
For comparison, I have generated a graph of rates in Australia, New
Zealand, and the United States at
<http://exhibit=2Egideononline.com/Salm-AZU.jpg>.
The following background data on salmonellosis in Australia are abstracted
