The Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture announced on [Fri 20 May 2016] that an Order of Special Quarantine has been posted at an equine facility in Enon Valley, Lawrence County. The quarantine was instituted after a horse on the premises tested positive for equine infectious anemia (EIA) at the Pennsylvania Veterinary Laboratory on 11 May 2016, with confirmation from the National Veterinary Services Laboratory today [20 May 2016].

According to the USDA, equine infectious anemia is an infectious and potentially fatal viral disease of members of the horse family.

There are 34 other equine animals (horses, miniature horses, and miniature donkeys) on this premises that are under quarantine. A news release from the Department of Agriculture does not give the name of the facility.

The infected horse has been stabled at the farm for the past 3 years. The department is investigating the infected horse's movement history and any other potentially exposed equine animals. These animals will remain under quarantined for at least 60 days. The quarantine can be lifted after the remaining animals are determined not to be infected.

Clinical signs of the disease can range from a healthy looking horse to one with a fever, leg swelling, and loss of strength. The disease is most commonly transmitted between horses by biting flies or the re-use of medical supplies such as needles.

There is no threat to human health from equine infectious anemia, according to the Department of Agriculture.

Horse owners with concerns may contact the Department of Agriculture's Bureau of Animal Health and Diagnostic Services at 717-772-2852.
