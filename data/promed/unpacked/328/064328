The Health Department says Western Australia's [WA] north is on track
to record its worst year for Ross River virus. 613 West Australians
have contracted the disease since July [2010] with almost twice as
many people contracting the mosquito-borne disease compared to the
previous year when there were 339 cases. Infection rates sky-rocketed
in Perth, the South West, and the far north in recent months. Last
year [2010], in the South West 105 people contracted the virus while
199 cases have been recorded this year.

Infection rates have quadrupled in the Kimberley from 28 people to
116 this year [2011]. In the Kimberley, the increase is being blamed
on a heavier than usual wet season. Medical entomologist Sue
Harrington says the situation will worsen in coming weeks. "This is
really, at the end of the wet season, the time when you start to see
the cases coming in, and certainly the figures for January and
February are high," she said. "If we keep getting Ross River virus
[infection] cases coming in at the rate we're getting them now, it's
going to be a pretty extreme year for the Kimberley." Most of the
infections in the Kimberley have occurred in Broome, where the local
shire says it is undertaking a spraying program for mosquitoes.

Meanwhile, the Health Department has confirmed a Carnarvon resident
has recorded the 1st case in WA in 2 years of an unusual
mosquito-borne disease. The person has been diagnosed with Murray
Valley encephalitis [virus infection]. The department is investigating
several other possible cases of the virus in the Pilbara and
Kimberley. Murray Valley encephalitis can cause severe illness and can
be fatal if not treated correctly.

[Conditions have been unusually wet in many parts of Australia,
leading to increased areas suitable for mosquito breeding. Cases of
Ross River virus infection continue to mount. On 1 Mar 2011 nearly 408
cases were reported (see ProMED-mail archive number 20110302.0687),
and now the total is 613. The symptoms of Ross River virus infection
include painful or swollen joints, sore muscles, rashes, fever,
fatigue, and headaches. Human Murray Valley encephalitis virus
infections can be serious, even fatal.
