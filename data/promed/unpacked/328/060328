Nigeria: 1st human avian influenza death
-----------------------------------------------
A Nigerian woman who died suffering from flu symptoms has tested positive
to the deadly H5N1 strain of avian flu virus, says a government minister.
It is the 1st bird flu death reported in Africa's most populous country
since the virus 1st emerged a year ago.
The woman, from the country's densely populated commercial capital, Lagos,
was among 3 people who died from flu-like symptoms recently. Blood samples
were taken from the 3 and sent to London and Rome. Information Minister
Frank Nweke Jr. told a news conference in Lagos that this was where they
were tested for the H5N1 virus.
The World Health Organization says 158 [164 as of 31 Jan 2007] people have
died of H5N1 bird flu since it's outbreak in December 2003, most of them in
Southeast Asia.
The UN had expressed concerns about the Nigerian government response to the
disease, as poultry are still being moved around by local farmers despite
an official quarantine and promised compensation for infected birds.
Cross-infection to humans is relatively rare and usually occurs when people
have been in close contact with infected birds.

Nigeria: Bird flu claims 1st human life in West Africa
-----------------------------------------------
Nigeria confirmed the 1st human death from the H5N1 virus in sub-Saharan
Africa on Wed 31 Jan 2007, after tests on a dead woman showed she had
contracted bird flu. The 22-year-old died after feathering and
disemboweling an infected chicken. She was from Lagos, the commercial
capital of Africa's most populous country, Information Minister Frank Nweke
said. Tests on 3 other victims, one of them the woman's mother, were
inconclusive.
Nigeria was the 1st African nation to detect the H5N1 virus in poultry last
year [2006] and had conducted tests on 14 people suspected of having the
virus. In Africa, 11 people have died in Egypt from bird flu since 2003,
and there has been a single non-fatal human case in Djibouti, in the
eastern Horn.
The H5N1 virus has killed at least 164 people worldwide, most of them in
Asia, and Indonesia has the world's highest death toll, at 63. Six
Indonesians have died in 2007 from bird flu, which is endemic in poultry in
most of the country's provinces.
Nigeria is among countries regarded by experts as the weakest links in the
global attempt to stem infections of birds. The virus has spread to 17 of
Nigeria's 36 states over the past year despite measures such as culling,
quarantine and bans on transporting live poultry.
World Health Organization spokesman Gregory Hartl said a human case of bird
flu in Nigeria was to be expected because of the experience in other
countries, such as Indonesia, with huge poultry populations where chickens
and hens live in close proximity to humans. "It does not change anything
from a public health point of view," Hartl said. "It had to happen sooner
or later."

[On Mon 29 Jan 2007, the WHO reported that the 14 suspected human cases of
avian influenza virus infection in Nigeria, including the 22-year-old woman
described above and now confirmed positive, had tested negative. The report
from a government source in Lagos has reversed this verdict. Confirmation
of this diagnosis from WHO is awaited. - Mod.CP]
