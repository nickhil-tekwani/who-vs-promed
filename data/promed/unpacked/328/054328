[CCHF presents a perfect example of emerging and reemerging zoonoses that threaten local, regional, and global health. The key to prevention and control is establishment of a sensitive and robust surveillance system using the One Health approach, so that transmission events can be detected at the earliest. This needs to be backed by reliable public health laboratory diagnostic support so that timely response measures can be initiated. - Mod.UBA
