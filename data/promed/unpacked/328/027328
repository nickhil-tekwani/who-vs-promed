Scotland: Laboratory Tests Confirm Infection with European Bat Lyssavirus
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Laboratory results of tests on a case of suspected rabies in Tayside,
Scotland, have proved positive. The tests were carried out on an adult male
patient at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee. The results confirm that he is
suffering from infection with European Bat Lyssavirus (EBL), a [species] of
rabies [vvirus] known to exist in several north European countries. His
condition remains critical but stable. The patient had prolonged close
contact with bats over many years and had been bitten on at least one occasion.
NHS Tayside Director of Public Health Drew Walker said: "Very regrettably,
laboratory tests have now confirmed our initial clinical diagnosis. Our
thoughts at this time are very much with this man and his family. I would
again strongly urge the media to pay proper respect to their wish for privacy.
"From a public health perspective, confirmation of the diagnosis does not
change the very simple advice offered from the outset the only members of
the general public who might be at risk from EBL are those who handle bats
or who have been bitten or scratched by them. Clinical staff closely
involved in treatment of the patient will continue to be offered advice and
vaccination where appropriate."

[This confirmation follows the failure of initial laboratory tests to
confirm the diagnosis of European Bat lyssavirus infection in this patient.
The press release does not distinguish between EBL 1 and EBL 2; further
information is awaited. The result is significant for the following
reasons, copied from ProMED-mail post: Rabies (EBLV 2), human - UK
(Scotland): susp (04) 20021122.5872. "Only 2 EBL infections have been
confirmed in UK bats: one on the south coast of England in 1996 and
another in northwest England in 2002 . Both of these bat rabies infections
were in the same species -- the Daubenton's bat. [Rare in the UK, and not
close to buildings.] In the case in 1996 it was thought that the bat might
have migrated from continental Europe. The location of the 2002 Lancashire
case is, however, more consistent with EBLs being present in a bat species
in the UK. The Veterinary Laboratories Agency in the UK tests about 200
bats every year for EBL, but has not so far detected the virus other than
the 2 cases in 1996 and 2002. EBLs do not readily cross the species
barrier, and even in parts of Europe where bats are known to carry EBLs, it
is very rare for other animals to be infected . The risk of EBL infection
being passed to domestic pets such as dogs and cats, and to wild
terrestrial mammals, is very low, and the rabies-free status of the UK has
been unaffected by the previous isolation of EBL in 2 bats in the UK. - Mod.CP]
