In a country with the highest per capita rate of human deaths from
rabies -- one in every 30 000 people -- the government of Bangladesh
and NGOs [Non-governmental Organisations] have undertaken the
country's 1st national dog census to prepare a mass vaccination and
neutering campaign. According to the government, dogs bit nearly 100
000 people in 2009, and at least 2000 died of rabies, a 2 percent
mortality rate. 65 percent of those deaths were children under 15.
According to a 2005 report by the World Health Organization (WHO)
[<http://whqlibdoc.who.int/trs/WHO_TRS_931_eng.pdf>], 25 000 people
in South Asia die of the disease annually, with dog bites causing 65
percent of those deaths.

Chief veterinary officer for Dhaka City Corporation Azmat Ali said
stray dogs are the main carriers of rabies in Bangladesh. "After the
breeding season ends in late autumn, stray dogs contract the
infection and spread it to cattle and humans by biting them."

The 5-week census, launched on 20 Dec 2010, is being undertaken as
part of the Department of Livestock Services' (under the Ministry of
Fisheries and Livestock) public health programme, which includes a
rabies control programme. The pilot phase starts in Dhaka, with plans
to roll out the count nationwide. The survey is supported by the NGO
Obhoyaronno (Bangladesh Animal Welfare Society) and is receiving
technical support from Gujurat-based Humane Society International
(HSI) in India.

Most of South Asia's 25 000 annual deaths from rabies are in India,
where 19 000 die every year from the disease, according to WHO. But
with a much larger population, estimated at 1.1 billion in 2009 by
the World Bank, the disease is under better control there, said
Rubaiya Ahmed, Obhoyaronno's founder.

"India is a pioneer when it comes to animal birth control. Although
there are still many areas where dogs are culled, animal birth
control is [in the process of being] implemented nationwide, and it
has been very successful in reducing rabies both in humans and animals."

Conducting a similar dog census as in Bangladesh, followed by a
massive spraying [vaccinating/spaying?] and neutering campaign, which
targeted 70 percent of the canine population, HSI successfully
reduced the number of human deaths from rabies in the Indian city of
Jaipur from 500 in 2000 to zero in 2010.

"The same approach [culling] to controlling rabies has been used in
Bangladesh for decades. If culling worked, it should have solved the
problem of rabies by now," said the director of HSI, Rahul Sehgal.
Animal welfare is still a new concept to the country, and culling is
widely practised, said Ahmed. "Many people themselves live in
inhumane conditions, so it is difficult to "sell" the concept of
animal welfare. But if you tell a person that by sterilizing animals,
his or her chances of dying from rabies are reduced, there is a much
greater chance of successfully convincing them." Obhoyaronno is
working to establish Bangladesh as a "No-culling nation" by 2015.

Following the census in the capital, organizers expect to publish a
report in March 2011 which will enable a plan to vaccinate, spray
[spay?] and neuter dogs in Dhaka. Animal welfare organizers are
hoping to avoid mistakes from the country's 1st dog-neutering
programme carried out in Narshingdi, a district 100 km north of
Dhaka, in November 2010. The campaign met with criticism when the
chemical sterilizations resulted in painful swellings for stray male dogs.

[It is reassuring to learn that culling is recognised to be an
ineffectual approach for the control of rabies in the stray dog
population, and that a combination of vaccination and neutering of
stray canines is the way ahead for Bangladesh. In the short term, it
should be possible, as demonstrated in neighboring India, to reduce
or eliminate human exposure to rabies virus infection in some large
urban centres. Extension of the campaign to the whole country will be
a more challenging prospect, and dispersion of baited vaccine may be
an additional option.
