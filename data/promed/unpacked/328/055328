State of emergency-in Irkutsk Region over dairy cattle disease
--------------------------------------------------------------
A state of emergency was imposed on the village of Pivovarikha,
Irkutsk Region, over a flare-up of a respiratory viral disease of
unknown etiology, Itar-Tass learnt on Wednesday [2 Jan 2007] at the
regional branch of the Ministry for Emergencies. [For a map of
Pivovarikha, see

A total of 240 cows fell ill on the livestock farm (located in
Pivovarikha) of the Irkutsk Agricultural Research Institute over the
1st days of the new year and the last week of December 2007.
Although there was no epizootic death, 91 cattle were axed [meaning
slaughtered/culled? - Mod.AS].
The reason for the cattle infection is being investigated. Samples were
dispatched for testing to the Federal Animal Protection Centre in the
city of Vladimir. The livestock farm is being disinfected.

[According to unofficial Russian sources, the [herd contained] cattle that had
been imported from Canada and the facility involved belongs to the
Irkutsk Research and Development Antiplague Institute of Siberia
(Agriculture Research Complex). Confirmation or otherwise, and details
on the population involved (age!), clinico-pathological findings and
laboratory results, are anticipated. Is there a zoonotic aspect to the
issue?! - Mod.AS]
