Two [more] people have been referred to their health care providers for consultation after being exposed to rabies in the southeastern part of Anderson County by a stray cat that tested positive for the disease, according to the Department of Health and Environmental Control. The individuals were exposed to the disease on 11 Sep 2014, and the animal was confirmed rabid by lab testing on 12 Sep 2014.

"Rabies is a threat to humans, pets and wild animals," Sandra Craig of DHEC's Bureau of Environmental Health Services (BEHS) said. "All pet owners should have their dogs, cats and ferrets vaccinated regularly as required by state law. It is extremely important to the health of your pet, your family and you that pet vaccinations are kept up-to-date."

"Unvaccinated pets that are exposed to the rabies virus must be quarantined or euthanized," she added. "Rabies is fatal once the virus reaches the brain, yet the heartache of losing a pet to this disease can be avoided. DHEC-sponsored rabies clinics are offered across the state by local veterinarians each spring, and low-cost vaccines are available every day at local veterinary clinics."

"If you think you have been exposed to the rabies virus through a bite, scratch or the saliva of a possibly infected animal, immediately wash the affected area with plenty of soap and water," Craig said. "Then be sure to get medical attention, and report the incident to DHEC."

There were 124 confirmed cases of animal rabies during 2013 in South Carolina. There have been 100 confirmed cases in animals statewide [so far] this year [2014]. This animal is the 5th to test positive in 2014 from Anderson County. There were 12 animals that tested positive in that county in 2013.

[Anderson County is in the northwest corner of South Carolina on the border with Georgia; see: http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/south_carolina_90.jpg.

It is clear that Anderson County, SC is a hotbed of animal rabies in a state that sees more than its fair share of this disease. My advice to any and all in South Carolina is if you have not yet got your pet dog or cat vaccinated, get it done immediately. When rabies is as active as this, the control people tend to euthanise 1st any exposed unvaccinated animal and quarantine 2nd. Vaccination is also something to consider with valued horses. There are many accounts in the literature of the severe damage a rabid horse can do, starting with kicking down barns and biting and killing humans.

There is clearly a background reservoir of wildlife rabies. A cat would not survive exposure to a rabid skunk or raccoon, but they will happily play with a sick infected bat. One hopes that the SC people are typing these recovered rabies viruses. - Mod.MHJ
