The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries has confirmed that it found cases of bovine ephemeral fever and lumpy skin disease [LSD] in some cattle in Oman but have the situation under control. According to the ministry, after an initial outbreak in Salalah and Taqah, no new cases have been recorded except for a smaller outbreak in Mirbat.

A statement by the ministry read, "The Ministry confirms that some cases have been found where cattle were killed by 3-day sickness (bovine ephemeral fever) and lumpy skin disease. Specialists at the ministry have formed field teams and a committee. The ministry has controlled cases in Salalah and Taqah and has monitored no new cases after the fact. Smaller outbreaks in Mirbat are being dealt with at the moment, and the field teams continue to offer services as soon as a case is reported."

Individuals who witness cases where cattle die unusually or develop symptoms are being advised to immediately contact the nearest agricultural development office or veterinary clinic.

[Lumpy skin disease (LSD), caused by a capripox viral disease of cattle, is an OIE-notifiable disease that has spread from Africa to the Middle East and, in recent years, into southeast Europe and southwest Asia, continuing northeastwards as far as Kazakhstan and adjacent Russian territories (see OIE's global outbreaks map, since 2014, at https://tinyurl.com/yaemejby). LSD is not zoonotic.

According to Oman's periodic reports to the OIE, the disease is endemic. During 2017, 90 outbreaks were reported, including 325 cases and 9 deaths. No vaccination applied.

Bovine ephemeral fever (BEF, also known as "3-day sickness"), is an economically important arboviral disease that affects cattle and water buffalo and is widespread in tropical and semitropical areas of the eastern hemisphere. In most cases, the main impact is on productivity. While the illness is usually brief, it can result in decreased milk yield, loss of condition, and reproductive losses, and recovery can be prolonged in some animals. Mortality is typically low (1-2 percent); however, significantly higher case-fatality rates were reported in some recent outbreaks.

BEF is caused by bovine ephemeral fever virus (BEFV), a member of the genus _Ephemerovirus_ in the family Rhabdoviridae. It is not included in OIE's list, and its occurrence does not require notification. However, when diagnosed for the 1st time in non-endemic countries, such a new introduction may be followed by reporting to the OIE (e.g., Tajikistan, 2002; see archive no. 20020814.5055). The disease is not zoonotic.

BEF, which has a seasonal pattern, has recently been reported from another Middle-Eastern country, Israel, and has, most probably, been circulating in other countries in the region. - Mod.AS
