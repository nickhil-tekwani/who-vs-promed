An outbreak of [peste des petits ruminants, PPR] and anthrax in 2
communities in the Hohoe District have been reported. Mr. James Komla
Dogbe, Hohoe District Chief Executive, made the report at the second
ordinary meeting of the Hohoe District Assembly. He said 47 sheep and goats
had died of PPR at Gbledi, and 35 goats died of anthrax at Fodome Amle.
Mr. Dogbe advised livestock farmers in the 2 communities to bury dead
animals and refrain from eating the carcass, as the disease [anthrax] could
affect human beings.
Mr. Samuel Dzebu, Hohoe District Director of Ministry of Food and
Agriculture, confirmed the outbreak and said vaccination had been organised
in the affected areas to contain the disease.

[Hohoe is about 175 km NE of Accra and on the eastern border with Togo.
Checking my records, anthrax is enzootic in Northern Region and the
southern Volta Region, i.e. in and about the drainage of the Volta river
along its full length. Ghana is reliable in reporting outbreaks to OIE. The
general pattern is that 2/3 of all outbreaks are in the Northern Region and
approximately the same for human cases. In 2001 they had 36 human cases
with 3 deaths. In 1997 there was a severe outbreak in Bolgatanga (Upper
East Region) on the border with Burkina Faso with 185 cases, 19 reported
officially. Sheep and goat outbreaks are usually in single digits with some
20-60 cases; in 1994 there were 12 outbreaks with 194 affected; vaccination
is usually 10 000 - 25 000 animals. For cattle it is about the same, but
with 141 head affected in 1999 and 264 in 1995; latterly annual cattle
vaccination has been in the range of 33 000 to 47 000 animals, down from 67
000 to 86 000 in previous years. The incidence in Togo is not dissimilar,
allowing for differences in size, so this Volta Region outbreak may be also
occurring in nearby parts of Togo. PPR is enzootic in Ghana. - Mod.MHJ]
