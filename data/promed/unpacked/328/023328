Avian influenza of the H5N8 strain was confirmed at a farm near Frodsham in Cheshire on [2 Nov 2020].

Testing today [on 3 Nov 2020] has confirmed that this is a highly pathogenic strain related to the virus currently circulating in Europe.

All 13 500 birds at the farm will be humanely culled to limit the spread of the disease. A 3-km Protection Zone and a 10-km Surveillance Zone have been put in place around the infected site to limit the risk of the disease spreading.

This case is unrelated to the H5N2 strain which was confirmed at a small commercial premises near Deal in Kent on Mon 2 Nov 2020 [see OIE report above. - Mod.CRD].

Public Health England (PHE) advises that the risk to public health from the virus is very low, and the Food Standards Agency advises that avian influenza poses a very low food safety risk for UK consumers. Properly cooked poultry and poultry products, including eggs, are safe to eat.

[Netherlands has reported, since 17 Oct 2020, HPAI H5N8-infected mute swans (_Cygnus olor_) and a Eurasian Wigeon (_Mareca penelope_) found dead in 3 sites. This is the 1st outbreak of H5N8 HPAI officially reported in the Netherlands since the last detection of H5N8 HPAI in April 2017 in wild mallards; it is also the 1st HPAI outbreak in western Europe this season.

The H5N8 HPAI introduction in the country is most likely related to wild bird migration.

Germany reported a case in a wild bird on 30 Oct 2020 (20201103.7912764). The case involved a Eurasian Wigeon found ill in Hamburg, subsequently testing positive for HPAI and euthanized. Germany has been on high alert for HPAI since the beginning of October 2020 and increased surveillance efforts. There have been further outbreaks of HPAI H5N8 in Russia, including outbreaks in poultry in the west of the country on 27 Oct 2020 following previous outbreaks in poultry, and cases in wild water-birds in southern central Russia, along the border with Kazakhstan, and in northern Kazakhstan's poultry.

The said and additional information is available in DEFRA's updated assessment of 30 Oct 2020 (Ref: VITT/1200 HPAI in Europe, at https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/932205/hpai-netherlands-poa-201030.pdf). The assessment is a reminder that the Eurasian Wigeon is strongly migratory and is a common winter visitor to Great Britain.

On 30 Sep 2020, ECDC (the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control) published a warning on increased risk of HPAI introduction. The warning followed HPAI outbreaks among wild and domestic birds in western Russia and Kazakhstan over the past few months. This region is a known autumn migration route for wild water birds heading to Europe.

The warning indicated that northern and eastern Europe are very vulnerable to new outbreaks, given past experience. When HPAI was detected in the same area of Russia in the summers of 2005 and 2016, epidemics followed in northern and eastern Europe: "If the pattern is repeated this year [2020], HPAI is expected to arrive in the same areas of Europe in autumn or winter. Subsequent spread to countries in southern and western Europe is also possible." The warning, urging EU states to step up surveillance and biosecurity measures to guard against possible new outbreaks of avian influenza this year [2020], is available at https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/avian-influenza-eu-alert-new-outbreaks.

Subscribers are encouraged to visit the recent commentary by wildlife moderator PMB on the HPAI situation in Europe at https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=7912764.

The risk of transmission of avian influenza viruses to the general public in Europe remains very low. However, to minimize the risk of transmission to humans, people are advised not to not touch dead birds without wearing appropriate personal protective equipment. - Mod.AS]

[Further information on these cases in the UK, including the restrictions and movement controls, can be seen at Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs' (DEFRA) and the Animal and Plant Health Agency's (APHA) "Guidance on Avian Influenza (Bird Flu)" website at https://www.gov.uk/guidance/avian-influenza-bird-flu#latest-situation, (latest update 3 Nov 2020).

"Wild birds migrating from mainland Europe during the winter period can spread the disease to poultry and other captive birds. There are some simple measures that all poultry keepers, whether they are running a large commercial farm, keeping a few hens in their back garden, or rearing game birds, should take to protect their birds against the threat of avian flu:

"These include:
- Keeping the area where birds live clean and tidy, controlling rats and mice and regularly cleansing and disinfecting any hard surfaces
- Cleaning footwear before and after visits
- Placing birds' feed and water in fully enclosed areas that are protected from wild birds, and removing any spilled feed regularly
- Putting fencing around outdoor areas where birds are allowed and limiting their access to ponds or areas visited by wild waterfowl
- Where possible, avoid keeping ducks and geese with other poultry species." - Mod.CRD
