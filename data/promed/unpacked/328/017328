[According to information kindly received from the clinical services
providers of the affected farm ("Hachaklait",
<http://www.hachaklait.org.il/english.asp>) the disease affected
predominantly young lactating cows (1st and 2nd lactation). Such animals
are kept on a separate shed/barn of the dairy cattle plant. The duration of
the disease was up to one week. The most common clinical signs were abrupt
milk production drop, elevated temperature, apathy, salivation, respiratory
distress, hyperaemia of muzzle, fetlocks and teats, and slight lameness.
There were no mortalities. The milk drop was accompanied by a rise in the
somatic cell count (SCC), one of the indicators of the quality of milk
(somatic cells are leucocytes). Details of automatically, electronically
registered rumination in one affected cow showed that decreased rumination
preceded by one day the start of the milk production drop. These symptoms
were much milder than those seen in the single previous Israeli outbreak of
BTV-8, in Rosh Haniqra, north western Israel. That herd, similarly a
high-yield dairy cattle operation, included 250 susceptible bovines, with
80 of them severely clinically affected, including 12 deaths; see
ProMED-mail 20090530.2008.

The comment in the OIE notification above, indicating that the older cows,
which reportedly remained (clinically) unaffected, had undergone an
outbreak of EHDV in 2006, deserves clarification. It is suggestive of
possible cross-protection between EHD and bluetongue, a suggestion in need
of further investigation. Any comments from experienced readers on the
possibility of such cross protection will be welcomed. It will also be
interesting to note if these animals remained serologically negative.

According to the information provided in July 2009 by the BT reference
laboratory at Pirbright, the Israeli strain of BTV-8 (Rosh Haniqra,
November 2008) showed a 99.7 per cent similarity in its VP-2 sequence with
the strain of BTV-8 isolated from the Netherlands in 2006. It is therefore
likely that the Israeli BTV-8 strain is derived from the recent European
outbreak of BTV-8. It may be assumed that the recent outbreak, similarly in
northern Israel, is of the same genotype; confirmation will be helpful. The
BTV-8 strain may have been introduced into the region by imported European
cattle; Lebanon is known to be the main regional importer of cattle from
countries in Western Europe known to be infected.

Performance of surveillance for orbiviruses in as many Eastern
Mediterranean countries as possible, early reporting of suspected cases,
and incorporation of laboratories in the diagnosis, will help decision
making on vaccination. - Mod.AS
