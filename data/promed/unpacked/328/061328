Europe achieves historic milestone as region is declared polio free
--------------------------
Global polio eradication effort needs US $275 million to protect this
achievement
The historic decision to certify the European Region of the World Health
Organization (WHO) polio-free was announced today at a meeting of the
European Regional Commission for the Certification of Poliomyelitis
Eradication (RCC) in Copenhagen. For some 870 million people living in the
Regions 51 Member States (1), this decision is the most important public
health milestone of the new millennium.
"This is a tremendous achievement in the global effort to eradicate polio.
To get where we are today required the full commitment and cooperation of
each of our 51 Member States, the hard work of public health workers in the
field, and the firm support of international partners in coordination with
WHO," declared Dr Marc Danzon, WHO Regional Director for Europe.
The European Region has been free of indigenous poliomyelitis for over 3
years. Europes last case of indigenous wild poliomyelitis occurred in
eastern Turkey in 1998, when a 2-year-old unvaccinated boy was paralysed by
the virus. Poliovirus imported from polio-endemic countries remains a
threat. In 2001 alone, there were 3 polio cases among Roma children in
Bulgaria and one non-paralytic case in Georgia ­- all caused by poliovirus
originating on the Indian subcontinent. A decade ago, imported poliovirus
paralysed 71 people and caused 2 deaths in a community in the Netherlands
that refused vaccination.
Of the recent importations, Sir Joseph Smith, Chairman of the RCC noted,
"We are satisfied that all measures were taken to ensure that wild
poliovirus imported into the Region did not lead to ongoing circulation.
All evidence confirms that. However," he cautioned, "our work does not stop
here. Throughout the European Region, ongoing vaccination and surveillance
is vital. The risk of poliovirus being imported into Europe will continue
until we eradicate polio globally."
The path to a polio-free European Region began in 1988, following the call
of the World Health Assembly to eradicate polio. A partnership was set up,
spearheaded by WHO, Rotary International, the US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) and UNICEF, to free the world of the disease.
Success in Europe was achieved through an unprecedented series of
coordinated national immunization campaigns, known as Operation MECACAR,
which involved 18 polio-endemic countries and areas in the European and
Eastern Mediterranean Regions of WHO (2). Some 60 million children under 5
years of age received 2 extra doses of polio vaccine every year from 1995
to 1998. Since 1997, MECACAR has included special door-to-door mass
vaccination in the high-risk areas of these countries. Supplementary
vaccination campaigns have continued in the highest-risk countries through
to 2002. This synchronization of immunization among neighbouring countries
has become a model for eradicating the disease globally.
The independent panel of international public health experts that comprises
the RCC has been engaged in the formal polio-free certification process in
Europe since 1996. Before certification could be declared, the RCC had to
scrutinize surveillance data and the evidence of national certification
committees. In addition, it received firm commitments from all ministries
of health on maintaining immunization and surveillance. "Excellent
surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis is an essential tool in regional
certification, and in the global initiative to eradicate polio. It provides
the exact location and ages of every child stricken with polio, guiding
immediate immunization responses," said Dr David Fleming, Acting Director
of CDC. "Sustaining this surveillance will be vital in guarding against the
ongoing threat of importation."
In addition to maintaining immunization, surveillance, and the ability to
respond to imported cases, European countries are now cataloguing all
laboratory stocks of poliovirus as part of a global plan to ensure
effective containment in a polio-free world. In contrast to smallpox, where
absolute containment was the goal, this plan aims for effective containment
to minimize the risk of an accidental or intentional reintroduction of wild
poliovirus, by handling retained materials under appropriate conditions.
Since the Global Polio Eradication Initiative was launched in 1988, 2 WHO
regions have been certified polio-free: the Americas in 1994 and the
Western Pacific in 2000. Polio cases have dropped from an estimated 350 000
in 125 countries in 1988 to just 480 reported cases in only 10
polio-endemic countries in 2001.
"In Europe and elsewhere we have worked to reach children living in some of
the most difficult conditions imaginable, including conflict-affected
areas," said Philip D. OBrien, UNICEF Regional Director for Central and
Eastern Europe. "This unprecedented effort, which has been rewarded today
with European certification, must be continued until we reach all children,
everywhere, with polio vaccine."
The polio eradication coalition includes the governments of countries
affected by polio; private foundations (e.g., the United Nations Foundation
and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation); development banks such as the
World Bank; donor governments (e.g., Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada,
Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Norway, the United Kingdom, and the United States); the
European Commission; humanitarian and nongovernmental organizations (e.g.,
the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies) and
corporate partners (e.g., Aventis Pasteur and De Beers). Volunteers in
developing countries also play a key role: 10 million have participated in
mass immunization campaigns.

achievement of polio-free status of the European Region (EURO) merits
attention, recognition, and congratulations. - Mod.MPP]
