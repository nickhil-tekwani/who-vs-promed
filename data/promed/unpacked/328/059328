17 workers from the Big Boi [Big Bull] refrigerator company in Paicandu metropolitan region of Maringa, northwest Parana were infected with brucellosis, which causes the so-called "cow disease." The event was reported in December 2013 but was only released this week. Since then, the employees have been treated and released.

Earlier this week [10-12 Feb 2014], the president of the Syndicate of Food Industry Workers of Maringa (STIAM), Roberto Pino Jesus, reported the case to the Human Rights Commission of the Senate. According to the president of the union, the complaint was formalized to draw attention to the non-application of Norm 36, in force since April 2013, which dictates the rules that establish the minimum requirements for assessing, controlling, and monitoring risks existing in activities in the slaughtering and processing of meat and the meat industry.

According to [Roberto Pino Jesus], the individual safety equipment that protects body, mouth, and eyes, for example, was not being used in the Paicandu refrigerator. But the president emphasized that the problem does not begin there. According to him, there are many gaps in oversight by the government. "The supervision is ineffective. Often, the farmer can beat the system and get the GTA [the Animal Transportation Certificate] and present documentation stating that the animal has been vaccinated when it has not been, and when it was sick but nevertheless was sent for slaughter."

[Brucellosis (http://www.medicinenet.com/brucellosis/article.htm) is a disease that is thought to have existed since ancient times, as it was 1st described more than 2000 years ago by the Romans and Hippocrates. It was not until 1887 that a British physician, Dr David Bruce, isolated the organism that causes brucellosis from several deceased patients from the island of Malta. This disease has had several names throughout its history, including Mediterranean fever, Malta fever, Crimean fever, Bang's disease, and undulant fever (because of the relapsing nature of the fever associated with the disease).

The symptoms and signs of brucellosis may develop from days to months after the initial exposure to the organism. While some individuals may develop mild symptoms, others may go on to develop long-term chronic symptoms.

The signs and symptoms of brucellosis are extensive, and they can be similar to many other febrile illnesses, so recognition of potential exposure -- from ingestion of unpasteurized milk or cheese, working in a slaughter house or meat processing plant, or working in a microbiology lab -- is vital. In this outbreak, it is not clear what symptoms the workers had or whether they were just seropositive. - Mod.LL
