According to a reliable source, since mid-July [2011] cases of a
disease, initially suspected to be bluetongue, have been observed in
cattle in western Turkey.

Confirmation or otherwise, and -- in case affirmed -- complementary
epidemiological, diagnostic, and/or geographical data, would be much
appreciated.

[The last reported outbreak of bluetongue in Turkey dates back to May
2010, in a flock of 150 sheep in Antalya, where 2 clinical cases were
observed. The serotype involved was, reportedly, BTV-16. See, with
map, at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=9834.

BTV is known since decades to be circulating in Turkey; several
serotypes, including BTV-2, -4, -6, -9, -10, -13, and -16 have all
previously been reported from Anatolian Turkey. (refs 1, 2).

Clinical signs in cattle, resembling bluetongue, could, theoretically,
be attributed also to another orbivirus, EHDV (epizootic hemorrhagic
disease virus). Clinically, the 2 are indistinguishable.

In case of bluetongue, serotype 8 is a plausible candidate in view of
its reported pathogenicity for cattle as observed in Europe, where it
was spreading from north to south between 2006 and 2009. BTV-8 has not
been reported, so far, from Turkey but may have been circulating there
earlier, since it was identified in sheep in Lesbos, a Greek island
adjacent to the Turkish coast, in 2008 (see ProMED-mail 20090529.1997,
including commentary). Most likely, this virus, transmitted by
_Culicoides_ midges, was circulating in other west Mediterranean
countries: it has been identified in Israeli cattle, on the Lebanese
border, in 2009. The Israeli isolate showed a 99.7 per cent similarity
in its VP-2 sequence with the strain of BTV-8 isolated from the
Netherlands in 2006 (please refer to commentary in ProMED-mail 20090828.3025).

EHDV serotype 6W has been found to be the causative agent of an
epizootic in western Turkey, which started in July 2007. Serious
clinical cases were described in cattle farms in Mugla, Izmir,
Canakkale, and Istanbul through the end of August 2007 (see
ProMED-mail 20080606.1809, 20090131.0434 and ref 3 below).
