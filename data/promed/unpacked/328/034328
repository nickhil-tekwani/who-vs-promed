Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) or monkey fever has claimed one life in Wayanad [district in Kerala state], marking it the 1st KFD death in the state after 2015.

[S] aged (27), a resident of the Begur tribal hamlet, died at the Kozhikode Medical College Hospital Saturday night [23 Mar 2019]. He was admitted to the Mananthavady district hospital on [10 Mar 2019] with symptoms of the disease and was later referred to the medical college.

"The deceased had gone for work in a timber yard near Begur where monkey deaths were reported recently. It is not confirmed whether he contacted the disease from there. We had collected samples from the ticks collected from the area to find out the source of infection," said Wayanad district medical officer R Renuka.

Renuka said that there have been 5 confirmed cases of KFD in Wayanad so far this year [2019] including [S]. Two are currently under treatment at the hospital, while 2 others have been discharged after treatment. "We had stepped up disease surveillance and preventive measures after KFD resurfaced in Wayanad after a gap of 2 years in January 2019. People should take adequate precautions before venturing into forests," she added.

Also, people have been asked not to go near dead monkeys and immediately inform forest and health department authorities if they come across monkey deaths.

Wayanad had witnessed KFD cases for 4 years in a row from 2013 onwards till 2016.

[KFD virus was 1st identified in 1957 in a sick monkey from the Kyasanur Forest in Karnataka state of India. The disease is transmitted to humans following a tick bite or contact with an infected animal, especially a sick or recently dead monkey. There is no evidence of person-to-person transmission (https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/kyasanur/index.html).

KFD typically occurs during the dry season from November through May, which correlates with the increased activity of the nymphs of ticks. Exposure to adult ticks and nymphs in rural or outdoor settings increases the risk of infection; herders, forest workers, farmers, and hunters are particularly at increased risk of contracting the disease. Vaccination and personal protective measures against tick bites are keys to prevent KFD.

There is no specific treatment for KFD. Prompt symptomatic and supportive treatment can reduce morbidity and mortality. Surveillance (human, monkey and tick), personal protection against tick bites, and vaccination are the key measures for prevention and control of KFD (https://idsp.nic.in/WriteReadData/l892s/60398414361527247979.pdf).

As per the media report above, 5 confirmed cases including one fatal case due to KFD have been reported from Wayanad district of Kerala in 2019. - Mod.UBA
