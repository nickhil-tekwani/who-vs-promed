With news of drug-resistant plague, I am asking that you post this UPI
excerpt about plague vaccines from last Spring's American Society for
Microbiology meeting.
Excerpted from the UPI Science News:
Army medical researchers say they are developing the first vaccine to protect
people against pneumonic plague, one of the great scourges of history.
Current licensed vaccines are effective against bubonic plague spread by
infected flea bites, but the new vaccine would also protect people against
the airborne form of the disease suspected of killing 40% of the population
of Europe during the 14th Century.
Although outbreaks of bubonic and pneumonic plague are rare in the United
States, there are still a few cases that occur each year, says George
Anderson Jr., chief of the medical branch developing the vaccine for the U.S.
Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases.
"People at risk of getting pneumonic plague are veterinarians and people who
have cats in the Southwestern part of the country," said Anderson. The cats
attack mice, rats and ground squirrels [infected with infected fleas]. Fleas
jump from the rodent to the cat. The cat then develops plague in which the
bacterium _Yersinia pestis_ invades the feline lungs. When the cat sneezes,
_Y. pestis_ floats in the air where it can be inhaled by humans who become
infected with pneumonic plague.
In a presentation at the annual meeting of the American Society for
Microbiology, Anderson showed that his vaccine, a fusion of _Y. pestis_
proteins, protects laboratory mice from pneumonic plague.
He said that the new vaccine is also likely to cause fewer side effects than
whole-cell vaccine; and the new vaccine requires just one inoculation for a
year's protection. A booster shot after one year is likely to be needed, he
said. The current bubonic vaccine involves a series of three shots and a
six-month booster.
It is not effective against the airborne form of the disease, Anderson says.

would also protect people against the airborne form". -- Mod CHC]
Plague still pops up around the world, most frequently in Africa, Madagascar,
Vietnam, Russia and parts of South America, Anderson says.
Note: A four page description of the current vaccine (use, side effects,
etc.) is available on-line from US Pharmacopoeia, Volume 2: Advice for the
Patient, Date:1997, Document ID:SL19970808010007284 from the Internet search
engine, Northern Light <http://www.nlsearch.com>.

Kong, 1894: the role of James A Lowson in the controversial discovery of the
plague bacillus," 5 July 1997, 350:59-62. (http://www.thelancet.com).
