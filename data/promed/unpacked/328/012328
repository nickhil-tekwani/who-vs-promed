[1] Merck: molnupiravir, anti-viral pill

Merck & Co.'s experimental pill for COVID-19 should be accompanied by other treatments as soon as they're available to cut the risk of drug resistance that would limit its effectiveness, Wellcome foundation director Jeremy Farrar said.

While yet to be cleared by regulators, Merck's molnupiravir has been hailed as a potential breakthrough, as it could be relatively cheap and easy to make, doesn't require infusion and has shown it reduces the risk of hospitalization in a trial. Yet it may need to be combined with other drugs to head off resistance, Farrar said. Resistance occurs when viruses and bacteria evolve to blunt or defeat drugs' mechanism of attack. It's a constant concern for antivirals and antibiotics and has already been seen with COVID treatments such as Eli Lilly & Co.'s antibody therapy. Farrar suggested Merck's pill would be no exception, despite optimism that it may be a potent new weapon to fight the pandemic.

"The thought that you could have an oral drug readily available that you could take as soon as you have a suspicion of infection -- that's a huge step forward globally," Farrar said. But he emphasized the importance of combining it with other drugs as soon as possible to "delay the onset of resistance."

While this is always a concern for anti-infectives, the likelihood that it will become a severe problem for molnupiravir appears to be low, said Nick Kartsonis, senior vice-president of clinical research for infectious diseases and vaccines at Merck Research Labs. Earlier experiments with other viruses showed that the evolution of resistant mutations was rare, he said. The course of treatment is short, meaning that viruses get few chances to evolve into resistant forms. Another reason lies in the drug's mechanism of action.

Pioneered by researchers at Emory University and other academic centers and later licensed by Merck's partner Ridgeback Therapeutics LP, molnupiravir works by introducing errors into the coronavirus's genetic material. The errors are then replicated until the virus is defunct.

Merck's analysis has shown that the errors induced by the drug are spread more or less randomly throughout the viral genome. That means that the virus has fewer opportunities to develop mutant forms that will overcome those errors. "That in and of itself makes resistance a tough thing," Kartsonis said.

Still, although Merck isn't pursuing combinations right now, molnupiravir may be more effective if used with other drugs that prove successful, Kartsonis said. That may also lower the potential for resistance even further, he said.

Many drugs have been far more effective in combination than when used on their own. The first drugs developed for HIV, when used singly, quickly stopped working because resistant strains evolved that could defeat the drugs' attack. By attacking pathogens from several angles, drug cocktails make the evolution of such variants less likely. Now, HIV combination treatments stay effective in individual patients for years.

Numerous other companies are working on pills to treat COVID through a variety of approaches. Pfizer Inc. began late-stage trials of an oral treatment this summer and expects data before the end of the year [2021]. Israel-based Redhill Biopharma Ltd.'s experimental therapy, opaganib, cut deaths in a group of patients with moderately severe COVID, according to data released earlier this month [October 2021]. Wellcome itself has pledged 8 million pounds (USD 11 million) for a project, called COVID Moonshot, to find a drug that would block a key protein the coronavirus uses to replicate.

An early study published last week showed molnupiravir has the potential to cut the rate of hospitalization and death by around 50% in mild to moderate COVID patients. A widely available COVID pill could be "massively important" in developing countries where hospital access is limited and vaccinations aren't readily available, Farrar said.

Countries are already lining up to secure supplies of the Merck drug. The company has said it will file for U.S. authorization as soon as possible, and European Union drug authorities may begin a rolling review of the drug that could speed clearance there.

Still, preventing the disease through vaccines remains a better strategy than relying on treatment, U.S. presidential adviser Anthony Fauci said on [Wed 6 Oct 2021].

The Wellcome foundation has been fighting for more equitable access to vaccines, tests and treatments for COVID-19 and is funded by a 29 billion-pound (USD 39 billion) investment portfolio. Farrar spoke in an interview ahead of a conference of Gesda, the Geneva Science and Diplomacy Accelerator, a group that tries to bring scientists and politicians closer together.

And read Nature article from 9 Oct 2021 "How antiviral pill molnupiravir shot ahead in the COVID drug hunt. The Merck pill, which could become the first oral antiviral COVID treatment, forces the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus to mutate itself to death. https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02783-1

"A pill could make treating patients earlier on in their infection much easier -- and more effective. It could also keep hospitals from overflowing, especially in places where vaccination rates are still low, such as many low- and lower-middle-income countries. Molnupiravir was so effective in a phase 3 trial involving COVID-19-positive people at risk of severe illness that clinicians halted enrolment early.

"But whether this clinical-trial success story will translate into a global game-changer in the fight against the pandemic isn't yet clear. Even if lower-income countries can afford the medicine, they might not have the diagnostic capacity to treat patients with molnupiravir early in the course of their illness when treatment could make a difference.

"The other therapies on offer against COVID-19, Gilead Science's antiviral remdesivir and a monoclonal antibody cocktail from biotech firm Regeneron, must be administered intravenously or by injection. That makes it difficult for people to access the therapies before they are sick enough to land in the hospital. And remdesivir is approved only for those who are already hospitalized with COVID-19. ..."

For these reasons, this pill is very attractive as an anti-viral. It seems unlikely that resistance will develop rapidly since the course of treatment is short, thus the virus will go through fewer replication cycles to develop resistance. - Mod.LK]

[In the past 24 hours,10 countries including UK (34 320), Russia (28 647), Turkey (28 370), the USA (24 694), India (19 018), the Philippines (12 119), Ukraine (11 344), Iran (11 256), Thailand (10 817), and Romania (10 400), have reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. A global total of 5437 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 8 Oct 2021 to late 9 Oct 2021). A total of 48 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 24 of the 48 countries are from the European region, 7 are from the Americas region, 5 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 5 are from the South East Asia region, 5 are from the Western Pacific region, and 2 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 5.9%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 6.3%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show an 11.6% decrease in daily reported cases and a 2.4% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported approx.300 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 238.64 million cumulative reported cases and over 4.86 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
