Residents of Palmeira de Fora, a suburb of Palmeira dos Indios, are concerned about the wave of Zika fever, and dengue chikungunya [infections] that afflict the residents of the neighborhood. On this Sunday morning [8 Nov 2015], the Zika fever took another victim.

According to information, a retired man, 84, a resident of Av. Principal who was hospitalized for more than 8 days in the Regional Hospital in Santa Rita, died on Sunday [8 Nov 2015] morning as a result of a Zika [virus infection]. Health problems due to age were exacerbated after the retired man contracted Zika [virus infection], which led to his death.

Last Wednesday [4 Nov 2015], the 1st victim, who lived in the neighborhood, was a singer, 67. In the wake of the death of the retired man, friends demanded the return of "fogging vehicles," which should act more often in the streets of the neighborhood. "Yesterday's fogging is over but was very weak. It should spend more time," said Maria do Carmo, a neighborhood resident.

Zika fever is an infection caused by Zika virus, transmitted by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, which usually bites in the evening and at night and is the transmitter of dengue and chikungunya fever [viruses] [this mosquito bites during the day, not at night].

The major symptoms are fever, itching skin, and red patches [rash]. One must, however, be careful with the combined infection -- dengue, chikungunya fever and Zika viruses -- since the effects of these infections together are not yet known.

[It is important to know whether the Zika virus infection was laboratory confirmed in these 2 fatal cases, and whether infections by dengue or chikungunya viruses were ruled out. Fatalities from Zika virus infections have not been reported in the outbreak in Brazil or Colombia. If the Zika fever diagnosis was made on clinical basis alone, that diagnosis is complicated by the similarity of symptoms between Zika, dengue, and chikungunya virus infections.
