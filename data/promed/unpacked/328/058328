More foot-and-mouth cases confirmed
-----------------------------------
South Korea confirmed 3 more cases of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) on
Saturday [4 Dec 2010], raising the number of affected farms to 20. All
cases are within a southeastern city where the outbreak was 1st
reported earlier in the week.

The Ministry of Agriculture announced that one pig farm and 2 cow
farms in Andong, located some 270 kilometers [168 miles] southeast of
Seoul in North Gyeongsang Province, have been affected by the animal
disease.

Of 33 suspected FMD cases reported nationwide, 23 came from Andong,
the ministry said. "Of the 23 cases from Andong, 20 have tested
positive for FMD," an official with the ministry said. Test results on
9 other suspected cases are due later Saturday, according to the
ministry. "We could have more reports of suspected cases of the
disease after this weekend," the official said.

South Korea remained free of FMD since 2002 until an outbreak in
January 2010, and again in April. The country was declared clear of
the animal disease, which affects animals with cloven hooves such as
sheep, goats and deer, in late September by the World Organisation for
Animal Health (OIE).

The ministry has ratcheted up its preventive measures in areas close
to Andong. It destroyed about 20 191 pigs at a farm in Boryeong, South
Chungcheong Province, west of Andong.

The ministry said a veterinarian who had visited an Andong pig farm
last week didn't change his shoes before going to the Boryeong pig farm.

[The background to the rapid spread of FMD in the Andong area may be
sought in the fact that a pig farm was involved from the early stages
of the epizootic (or was the index case?). Pigs, readily FMD-infected
by the oral route, are regarded as FMD virus (FMDV) "amplifiers,"
since they have been shown to emit large quantities of the virus.
FMDV, and in particular certain strains thereof, can be windbourne to
considerable distances.

Cattle, on the other hand, are regarded as "FMDV indicators" -- shown
to be highly susceptible to respiratory infection, even if small
amounts of virus particles are involved. The density of cattle farms
in the region and their size(s), are other factors to be considered;
available information on the relevant situation in the affected region
will be helpful.

Last but not least, the level and quality of the biosecurity measures
undertaken prior and during an outbreak, are another factor of
significance.

Official confirmation of the new cases additional details are expected
to be included in the next weekly follow-up report. - Mod.AS]
