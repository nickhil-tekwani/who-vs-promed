A team of dermatologists and dermatopathologists at UT Southwestern
Medical Center has identified 9 North Texas cases of an infectious
skin disease common in South America, Mexico and in the Middle East,
where it is sometimes referred to as a "Baghdad boil."
Numerous cases of the disease, called leishmaniasis, have been
reported in troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. But for the
1st time, cases of this dangerous infection are appearing in North
Texas in patients who have not traveled to endemic areas.
The infection causes non-healing sores that can be the size of a
half-dollar or larger and that look like boils. These sores usually
last for 6 to 12 months, and, because they are often mistaken for a
staph infection, patients may have been given multiple courses of
standard antibiotics without success.
The disease is caused by single-celled parasites called _Leishmania_,
and special cultures must be done in order to confirm the diagnosis
of leishmaniasis.
The identified cases were from Waxahachie, Hillsboro and Glenn
Heights, all areas south of Dallas; Tom Bean, Anna, Savoy and Nevada,
all north of Dallas; and North Richland Hills.
North Texas doctors must have a high index of suspicion and
understand that this organism must now be considered endemic in this
area, said Dr. Kent Aftergut, a clinical instructor of dermatology at
UT Southwestern and in private practice at Methodist Charlton Medical Center.
"Luckily, all of the leishmaniasis cases in North Texas that have
been cultured have grown _Leishmania mexicana_, which is less
dangerous than other forms of the parasite," he said. "It makes skin
sores, but the infection doesn't spread and become a full body
disease like some of the others species of _Leishmania_. Usually, if
patients have a normal immune system, the sores will resolve in 6 to
12 months and won't make the patients ill."
In North Texas, doctors suspect that the process leading to human
infection begins when a sand fly bites a rodent called the burrowing
wood rat, which carries the parasite. When the sand fly later bites a
person, the sores may develop, said Dr. Aftergut, who began tracking
cases in North Texas after identifying the ailment in a patient who
had been simply working outside in his yard and had no travel history
to areas of infection.
"If a patient has been in Iraq or another known endemic area, we are
very used to looking for leishmaniasis. But in the past, you just
would not have suspected it in a patient living in North Texas with
no travel history. This is why I think it's important to get the word
out to other health-care professionals," Dr. Aftergut said.
For many years, sporadic cases have been seen in South Texas. But no
one has ever reported cases this far north, Dr. Aftergut said. He
said this may be due to a movement in either the burrowing wood rat
or the sand flies that transmit the infection to humans, although the
reason for this movement is unclear.
"There are 9 cases of leishmaniasis in North Texas residents who had
no travel history in the last 2 years," said Dr. Aftergut. "This is
very strong evidence that the areas we need to consider endemic are
moving north."
Dr. Aftergut said he believes that rural areas are more at risk due
to their proximity to wooded areas, where the burrowing wood rat and
sand flies are more likely to be found.
Dr. Aftergut said using insecticides, bug repellant and protective
clothing while working in areas where sand flies might be present
should help reduce exposure. Once bitten, there are 2 types of
medicines to treat the infection; however, one treatment can be toxic
to some patients.
Doctors who identify a possible case of leishmaniasis should contact
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which can assist with
the special tests needed to verify it. The federal agency also is
tracking cases, Dr. Aftergut said.

[That the area in which leishmaniasis cases are being observed is
further north compared to the previous reports from the 1980s is
significant. Since the infections have been genotyped as _L.
mexicana_, the possibility that they are due to local transmission of
other genotypes of _Leishmania_ introduced by military personnel
returning from the Middle East and Afghanistan can be excluded.
Diagnosis of cutaneous leishmaniasis can also be done by microscopy
of tissue samples taken from the lesions and by PCR (polymerase chain
reaction), which is easier to perform than culture. - Mod.EP]
