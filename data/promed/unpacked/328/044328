The Czech veterinary authorities have started destroying thousands of laying hens at a farm in Pohořelice, southern Moravia, following a salmonella outbreak.

As many as 35 000 of around 60 000 hens have so far been destroyed and the market chain Lidl has taken all egg deliveries from the farm off its shelves. People have been asked to return eggs already purchased at the market chain. This concerns eggs with an expiry date up to [11 Sep 2017].

The salmonella was detected due to health problems at a children's camp.

[The Czech Food Safety Information Center of the Ministry of Agriculture, Prague, has issued today [Thu 24 Aug 2017] a press release addressing the said issue: see, in Czech, at http://www.bezpecnostpotravin.cz/svs-vydala-mimoradna-veterinarni-opatreni-kvuli-vyskytu-salmonely-v-chovu-nosnic.aspx. The official press release, as well as the Radio report above, does not disclose the salmonella serotype involved. This significant piece of information is herewith requested.

Egg-sourced salmonellosis has recently been suspected also in Israel. The National TV station "Kan" transmitted on [20 Aug 2017] a news item citing the Center for Disease Control in the Ministry of Health, according to which the number of salmonella-infected humans had doubled in recent weeks, compared with the same period in 2016. The Ministry reportedly suspected marketed table eggs as the source of infection. In response to media inquiry, the Ministry said that, together with the Ministry of Agriculture, it regularly monitors egg-related infections. "The eggs are to be bought only at known retail chains, which have a storage stamp on the refrigerator and an expiration date," the spokesman said. No further targeted control measures, including recalls, have been reported as being applied, nor information on the current salmonella situation on the layers' farms. The media report (in Hebrew) is available at http://www.kan.org.il/Item/?itemId=21807.

Official confirmation -- or otherwise -- of the above, in particular addressing the serotyping and genotyping of the causative agent in humans, in laying hens and in contaminated eggs, is requested. - Mod.AS
