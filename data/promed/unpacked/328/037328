Parents, day-care centers and others are being asked to help stop an
outbreak of shigellosis, a highly contagious disease that causes diarrhea,
stomach aches and other problems. Up to 26 people, including four adults,
have been infected with the disease since 15 Jun 2000. It originated at a
Lincoln child care center, Scott Holmes, chief of the Lincoln-Lancaster
County Health Department, said.
Proper hygiene, especially washing hands after using the bathroom or before
preparing food, is the best way to prevent the spread of the disease.
Children with any sign of a gastrointestinal problem should not use public
swimming pools, Holmes said.
The disease is treatable with antibiotics, but people can remain contagious
for one week. If untreated, those infected can be contagious for three to
four weeks, Holmes said.
It is Lincoln's fifth shigellosis outbreak in recent years.
