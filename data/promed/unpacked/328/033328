In January and February 2017, symptoms of leaf rust were observed in a commercial blueberry (_Vaccinium corymbosum_) field, in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The disease started as small reddish-brown leaf spots with yellowish pustules. As the disease progressed, the leaf spots enlarged, becoming vein delimited with a reddish-purple halo. At later stages, lesions coalesced, spreading all over the plant, causing severe early defoliation of the plants (especially on cvs Jewel and Snowchaser).

Laboratory analysis (morphology, molecular tests, pathogenicity tests to verify Koch's postulates) confirmed that the causal agent was _Thekopsora minima_ (EPPO A2 List).

This is the 1st time that _T. minima_ is reported from Brazil. Further studies are needed to evaluate the risk that blueberry leaf rust may present to commercial fields in Brazil.

[Blueberry (leaf) rust can be caused by the fungus _Thekopsora minima_ and also another rust species (_Naohidemyces vaccinii_), depending on the region. The disease affects a range of plants in the _Ericaceae_ family, including _Vaccinium_ species with crops like blueberry, bilberry and cranberry, as well as ornamentals such as rhododendrons and heathers. Symptoms may include yellow leaf spots on the upper surfaces of young leaves, followed by orange pustules developing on leaf undersides that release the spores. In severe cases or on highly susceptible cultivars, leaves turn brown and drop prematurely, resulting in serious defoliation and potentially death of the plant.

Rust spores are spread by wind over long distances and by splashing rain and mechanical means locally. Infected plant material, including fruit and budwood, poses a high risk of spreading the disease. The rusts can overwinter on evergreen blueberry leaves or alternative hosts in milder climates. Highbush varieties, like the 2 cultivars mentioned above, are most susceptible. Disease management for rusts is extremely difficult and relies mainly on timely fungicide applications, choice of crop cultivars, phytosanitation and control of pathogen reservoirs. Crop monitoring for early discovery of infection is important so action can be taken to limit the spread of the pathogens as well as build-up of inoculum.
