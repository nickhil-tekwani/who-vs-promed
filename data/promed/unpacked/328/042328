Q fever, an acute febrile disease that is transmitted from domestic animals to humans, has been confirmed in 9 residents of the village of Mavrinci in Grobnišćina near Rijeka, Croatia. The outbreak was confirmed today [18 Mar 2022] by the Primorje-Gorski Kotar [Primorsko-Goranska] County Public Health Teaching Institute.

According to epidemiologist Danijela Lakošeljac, there are probably more patients, given that the incubation lasts 2 to 3 weeks.

Q fever is a disease caused by the bacterium _Coxiella burnetii_. This bacterium naturally infects some animals, such as goats, sheep, and cattle. Epidemiologists suspect 3 pens of 60 to 70 sheep and goats near the residents' homes may be the source and advised locals to avoid the pens when possible and practice good hygiene and biosafety.

[_Coxiella burnetii_, an obligate intracellular rickettsia-like bacterial pathogen, causes Q fever. Q fever is primarily an occupational hazard for farmers, veterinarians, and abattoir workers in contact with infected domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, and goats, which serve as the reservoir of infection for humans. Humans usually become infected by inhaling aerosolized organisms that are shed in urine, feces, milk, and especially birthing products of infected animals; intermittent high-level shedding occurs at the time of parturition, with millions of bacteria being released per gram of placenta. Ingestion of contaminated unpasteurized milk or milk products is a less common mode of transmission (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25692216/). In 2014, a Q fever outbreak occurred in Canadian and US travelers to Germany, where they received live sheep cell therapy (ProMED post 20170416.4974554).

Q fever spreads easily in agricultural regions via airborne particles containing the _C. burnetii_ dispersed for a considerable distance to involve people living downwind from infected livestock. Widespread transmission of Q fever was recently documented in the Netherlands downwind from the index farm, a single dairy-goat farm, even beyond a 5 km (3 mi) high-risk zone (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/55/12/1591.long#T2). _C. burnetii_ is highly resistant to drying, heat, and many common disinfectants, which is attributed to a small cell variant of the organism that is part of a biphasic developmental cycle. These features enable the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment.

Although often asymptomatic, the infection can present acutely 2-3 weeks after exposure as atypical pneumonia or hepatitis or as a chronic disease (mainly endocarditis/endarteritis) (http://cmr.asm.org/content/12/4/518.short). The patients at highest risk for chronic Q fever are those with valvular heart disease, a vascular graft, or an arterial aneurysm (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6203a1.htm). Unusual complications include glomerulonephritis and rhabdomyolysis (http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08860220701460178). Post-Q fever fatigue syndrome has been reported in up to 20% of patients with acute Q fever.

Diagnosis of Q fever can usually be confirmed by serology (https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/qfever/clinicians/diagnosis.asp). In acute Q fever, phase II antibodies are usually much higher than phase I antibodies and are detectable by indirect immunofluorescence 2 to 3 weeks after onset of illness. In chronic Q fever, phase I antibody titers are much greater than phase II titers. Phase I antibody titers of 1:800 or higher are considered diagnostic in endocarditis patients for chronic Q fever.

The tetracyclines are considered the antibiotics of choice for treatment of acute Q fever. Q fever endocarditis is treated with the combination of doxycycline plus hydroxychloroquine for at least 18 months (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/414865).

A human vaccine for Q fever is used in Australia, but it is not available in the United States. In Australia, Q fever vaccination is recommended for those working in "at-risk" occupations such as abattoir workers, farmers, stockyard workers, shearers, animal transporters, and others exposed to cattle, camels, sheep, goats, and kangaroos or their products (including products of conception), veterinarians, veterinary nurses, veterinary students, professional dog and cat breeders, agricultural college staff and students, wildlife and zoo workers (working with high-risk animals), and laboratory personnel handling veterinary specimens or working with the organism (https://immunisationhandbook.health.gov.au/vaccine-preventable-diseases/q-fever).

If the person has a positive history of previous infection with Q fever, vaccination is contraindicated; in others, serum antibody determination and skin tests must be done before vaccination to exclude those likely to have severe local or systemic hypersensitivity reactions to the vaccine resulting from previous unrecognized exposure to the organism (https://immunisationhandbook.health.gov.au/vaccine-preventable-diseases/q-fever). Q fever vaccine is not routinely recommended for children aged less than 15 years of age and pregnant or breastfeeding women because safety of the vaccine in these situations has not been established. Revaccination is not indicated due to the possibility of severe hypersensitivity reactions.

We are not told how the 9 residents of the village of Mavrinci, Croatia were exposed to _Coxiella burnetii_ or why more patients are suspected. Did their occupation put them at risk? More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

Croatia (pop., nearly 3.9 million residents) is a member of the European Union and borders Slovenia to the northwest, Hungary to the northeast, Serbia to the east, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro to the southeast, and shares a coastline along the Adriatic Sea. Croatia's capital and largest city is Zagreb, and agriculture accounts for 3.7% of the country's GDP. Primorje-Gorski Kotar (Primorsko-Goranska) County is in western Croatia on the Adriatic coastline. Mavrinci is a village with about 1020 residents (https://mapcarta.com/N2234995327).
