The number of measles cases in the country almost tripled in the 1st 5 weeks of the year [2018], compared to the same period last year [2017], according to the Department of Health.

According to the latest Measles Disease Surveillance Report, 877 measles cases were recorded from 1 Jan-3 Feb 2018, with 12 deaths.

In the same period last year [2016], 293 measles cases were recorded.

Measles outbreaks were recently been declared in Zamboanga, Davao, Taguig cities and in 7 towns of Negros Oriental.

The DOH said one of the factors in the measles outbreaks could be the refusal of parents to have their children immunized due to the scare brought about by the Dengvaxia scandal.

The latest measles reports showed the areas with the highest number of measles cases are the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao [ARRM] with 249, Zamboanga Peninsula with 210, and Davao Region with 151.

There were 12 deaths reported -- 6 in the Davao region, 5 in the ARMM, and 1 in the Soccsksargen region.

Children aged 1-4 years old are most affected, at 39.79 percent, followed by infants below 9 months old at 18.70 percent, and infants 9 --11 months old at 9.9 percent.

At least 3 in every 5 cases, or 62 percent, were children who have not been vaccinated against measles.

The DOH report said among the top reasons for non-immunization were the "mother was busy" (25 percent), child was "not eligible" for vaccination (24 percent), and child was sick (15 percent), and "fear of side effects" of the vaccine. Those whose parents refused immunization for various reasons make up only 1 percent, according to the report.

[2] Australia (Melbourne) ex Malaysia: alert

An Australian man has sparked a measles alert after becoming ill on a flight back to Melbourne [Victoria]. The middle-aged man flew with AirAsia from Kuala Lumpur [Malaysia] and potentially exposed hundreds of passengers with the illness.

A warning was issued by Victoria's health department for those on the AirAsia flight D7214 which landed in Melbourne on Wednesday morning [6 Mar 2018], SBS News reported. 'We are working with airline officials to identify and contact passengers who shared the international flight,' deputy chief health officer Brett Sutton said.

Other people in the airport at the same time could also be at risk of contracting the highly contagious illness.

The viral disease is serious for young children but it can be prevented through vaccination.

Symptoms of measles include a runny nose, red eyes and a cough followed by a rash and fever which can appear three to seven days after first symptoms. The disease can cause serious illness in young children including pneumonia.

This is the 2nd confirmed case of measles for Victoria this month [March 2018]. A measles warning was issued earlier in March after a backpacker contracted the illness and travelled to tourist destinations including Phillip Island, the Great Ocean Road, and St Kilda beach.

In late February [2018] another man in his late 40s visited areas in south Melbourne while he was highly infectious with measles.

Despite recent occurrences, measles are uncommon in Australia due to widespread vaccinations.

[3] Somalia: WHO, vaccination campaign

Huge measles campaign in drought-hit Somalia aims to protect children and save lives
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A nationwide campaign continues in Somalia to protect millions of children against the potentially deadly effects of measles. WHO, UNICEF, national and local health authorities aim to reach more than 4.7 million children aged from 6 months-10 years during the overall campaign.

This week, the campaign targets 2.7 million children in the southern and central states, along with 1.1 million children in Somaliland. The vaccinations will be available at health centres and temporary vaccination sites. Puntland implemented its campaign in January [2018] when over 933 000 children were vaccinated.

Over 2800 cases of suspected measles have been reported since the start of the year [2018], with the most affected regions including Bay, Banadir, and Mudug. In 2017, there were more than 23 000 suspected cases of measles -- 6 times as many as in 2016 -- with the vast majority (83 percent) affecting children under 10.

In early 2017, WHO, UNICEF and partners, together with national health authorities, vaccinated nearly 600 000 children aged 6 months-5 years for measles in hard-to-reach and hotspot areas across Somalia.

"The campaign will intensify efforts to improve immunity against measles and reach unvaccinated children. As we saw last year when partners responded to a major cholera outbreak, with the right interventions, WHO and health authorities are confident that similar success may be seen in controlling this measles outbreak," said Dr Ghulam Popal, WHO Representative in Somalia.

More than 2 years of severe drought has led to widespread child malnutrition, mass displacement, and a lack of access to clean water and sanitation, creating ideal conditions for infectious disease outbreaks.

"The situation is especially critical for millions of under-vaccinated, weak and vulnerable children who are susceptible to contracting infectious diseases. More than 1.2 million children are projected to be at risk of acute malnutrition in the next 12 months. These children are 9 times more likely to die of killer diseases such as measles and acute watery diarrhoea/cholera than healthy children," said Steven Lauwerier, UNICEF Somalia Representative.

Ahead of this latest campaign, in late 2017, WHO conducted a series of trainings for Somali health workers on early outbreak detection and response for measles. The training aimed to enhance measles case-based surveillance and laboratory confirmation, improve measles case management during outbreaks, and achieve high routine measles vaccination coverage.

UNICEF has procured and distributed over 4.7 million doses of measles vaccine and organized 1700 social mobilizers to encourage families to vaccinate children and adults who are not or think they might not be fully immunized. This will be accompanied by vitamin A supplementation which will help to boost immunity.

The response is supported through funding from Alwaleed Philanthropies (Saudi Arabia), the Measles and Rubella Initiative, WHO, and the Somalia Humanitarian Fund.

Health officials in Butebo and Mbale districts have announced an outbreak of measles. The acting Butebo District Health Officer, Dr Nathan Tibako, said on [Tue 13 Mar 2018] that the airborne disease had been confirmed in 44 people after laboratory tests were done in February this year [2018].

"We have embarked on massive community sensitization and immunization of mostly children from 5 months-5 years to avoid further spread," he said.

He said 4 new cases were registered at Galimagi community health centre, one of the centres handling patients with symptoms of measles.

The most affected villages in the district are Kashebai, Kanyum, Petete, Kachecha, and Kachulu [Butebo district]. "The district and the ministry of health are collaborating to carry out a mini-campaign against the disease and the program will be rolled out in the entire district because it is worsening," Dr Tibako said.

He added that patients are suffering from measles present symptoms such as high fever, whooping cough, red swelling eyelids, muscle and body aches, irritability, a running nose, water eyes, and rashes.

In Mbale, the District Health Officer (DHO), Dr Jonathan Maasa Wangisi told Daily Monitor that measles had already been confirmed in 12 people after laboratory tests were done.

He said the district is undertaking a number of measures to control the spread of the disease including sensitizing public about the signs, symptoms and dangers of the disease and undertaking immunization programme of children.

"We appeal to parents to take their unvaccinated children under 5 years of age for immunization to the nearest health facilities," Dr Wangisi said.

[5] Europe: vaccination laws
Date: Mon 12 Mar 2018

A recent 4-fold increase in measles cases in Europe has been linked to declining vaccination rates, prompting several European countries along with other nations to pass legislation making more vaccinations mandatory and penalizing parents who refuse to vaccinate their children.

Vaccine hesitancy is a fear of the risk side effects of vaccination and the safety of vaccine components, which can lead parents, pregnant women, and other groups to delay or entirely refuse vaccination. A 1998 paper linking the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine to autism was debunked and withdrawn, and the author's medical license revoked, but in the 20 years since its publication, the study has been blamed for declining vaccination rates. Despite the reductions in morbidity and mortality from vaccine-preventable diseases in recent decades, the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says vaccine hesitancy has led to significant outbreaks of diseases such as measles, rubella, and polio in under-vaccinated communities.

Of the 21 315 measles cases that occurred in Europe's 2017 measles outbreaks, 5006 cases were reported in Italy, and the ECDC says outbreaks of the virus are still occurring in a number of countries. Measles vaccination coverage for children in Italy was 85% in 2015, below the target goal of 95% needed to achieve herd immunity. In response, Italy's Parliament passed a law making vaccinations mandatory for children being registered for school. Under the law, which took effect in September 2017 at the start of the school year, children up to the age of 16 are required to have vaccinations for chickenpox, diphtheria, Haemophilus B (Hib), hepatitis B, meningitis B and C, measles, mumps, polio, rubella, tetanus, and whooping cough. In addition, parents in Italy who don't have their children vaccinated will face penalties, including being prohibited from enrolling their children in public or private schools and fines of Euro 500 to Euro 7500 (USD 559 to USD 8380).

"The international scientific community unanimously recognizes that vaccines are one of the safest and most effective public health tools of all time," a press release from Italy's Ministry of Health reads. "This practice of primary prevention of infectious diseases entails benefits not only for a direct effect on the vaccinated subjects, but also indirectly, inducing protection for those not vaccinated (so-called herd immunity)."

In Romania, which reported 5562 measles cases in 2017, health ministry officials said that there are more than 224 200 children between the ages of 9 months and 9 years who have not been vaccinated for measles. On 9 Aug 2017, Romanian lawmakers adopted a draft bill obligating parents and legal guardians to vaccinate their children, with the state funding and organizing vaccinations. Germany, which saw 927 measles cases last year, has also fought against declining vaccination rates by passing a law calling for kindergartens to report to authorities any parents who fail to provide documentation of vaccination. Parents who fail to follow health ministry requirements on vaccination face penalties of up to Euro 2500 (USD 2800).

In 2015, Australia's government announced that it was seeking to limit immunization requirement exemptions, and, as such, proposed a "No Jab, No Play" measure aimed at improving vaccination rates. The measure eliminated the conscientious objector exemption while maintaining certain medical and religious exemptions, and extended immunization requirements to children of all ages. The states of New South Wales and Victoria have gone further by passing legislation banning unvaccinated children from enrolling in schools and child care centers and imposing fines on centers that admit unvaccinated children. In 2017, the state of South Australia (SA) proposed a similar bill. "The new 'No Jab, No Play' laws will mean children must be appropriately immunized, on an immunization catch-up program, or be exempt for medical reasons, in order to attend early childhood care services," according to the Government of South Australia.

It is with the hope that these efforts to get more children vaccinated will work to quell the ongoing outbreaks running rampant throughout Europe.
