[FMD has not been recorded in Kazakhstan since 2007. According to
Kazakhstan annual reports to the OIE, routine FMD vaccinations have been
applied in 2008 (cattle 5 943 860, sheep/goats 13 534 000) and 2009 (cattle
1 928 000, s/g 5 616 130). The national population, (OIE, 2008 figures)
are: cattle 6 008 200; s/g 16 937 500).

An interactive map, showing the location of the outbreak, is included in
the notification at the above URL.

The current notification of FMD, causing clinical disease in cattle (and,
apparently, no clinical disease detected in sheep-goats and pigs) raises
several questions:
1. which serotype is involved;
2. which serotype has been included in the vaccine applied for the routine
vaccinations in Kazakhstan in 2008 and 2009;
3. which serotype has been included in the vaccine applied for the current
"Vaccination in response to the outbreak?"
4. whether the affected animals had been vaccinated prior to the outbreak?
If affirmative, when, how many times, at what age?
5. has FMD been included in tests carried out in the Saiga antelopes, in
which mass mortality has been reported in Kazakhstan since mid May 2010?
(For the possibility of FMD and/or other infectious diseases being
involved, see previous postings listed below).
6. if not, are serological tests in the antelopes being contemplated?
7. is the health problem in the Saiga antelopes resolved?
8. have samples of the suspected/infected material from the cattle involved
been forwarded to an FMD International Reference laboratory for further
serotyping and particularly for genotyping?

ProMED-mail's requests for information on the recent Saiga event have
remained, so far, unanswered. - Mod.AS

Let's keep the focus on Saiga antelope and not ring vaccination or the drop
off in vaccinations from 2008 to 2009. - Mod.PC]
