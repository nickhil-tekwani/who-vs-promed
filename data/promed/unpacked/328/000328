Avian Influenza Weekly Report, 24 - 31 Mar 2006
-----------------------------------------------
A total of 38 cases of avian influenza in wild birds have so far been
confirmed by the Friedrich Loffler Institute (FLI) for the year 2006. In
the week of 24 Mar 2006 (12 noon) until 31 Mar 2006 (12 noon), the
following new cases were confirmed:
No. / Municipality / Administrative or City District / Regional District /
Species / Date H5N1 confirmed
38 / Straubing / Town of Straubing / Lower Bavaria / Swan / 30 Mar 2006
37 / Straubing / Town of Straubing / Lower Bavaria / Swan / 27 Mar 2006
36 / Oberau (Town of Straubing) / Town of Staubing / Lower Bavaria /
Buzzard / 27 Mar 2006
35 / Sterpersdorf (Town of Hochstadt on the Aisch) / Erlangen-Hochstadt /
Middle Franconia / Swan / 24 Mar 2006
34 / Merkendorf / Ansbach / Middle Franconia / Swan / 24 Mar 2006
33 / Nurnberg-Grosreuth / City of Nurnberg / Middle Franconia / Falcon / 24
Mar 2006
32 / Teublitz / Schwandorf / Upper Palatinate / Buzzard / 24 Mar 2006
31 / Sterpersdorf / Erlangen-Hochstadt / Middle Franconia / Mute Swan / 24
Mar 2006
So far in 2006, 4655 wild birds have been handed over to the Bavarian
Agency for Health and Food Safety (Landesamt fur Gesundheit und
Lebensmittelsicherheit or LGL); 3992 of these have already been tested for
influenza A, and 63 samples have been sent to the FLI because they were
influenza A positive. The FLI has confirmed 38 as H5N1 positive, 14 as H5N1
negative, and 11 have yet to be determined.
188 carnivores (martens, foxes, cats) have been sent to the LGL; 181 have
been evaluated for influenza A virus. One influenza A positive sample has
been forwarded to the FLI, where it was [found] H5N1 negative.

[The impressive effort invested in the sampling and testing of wild birds,
in Germany and other European countries, seems to be paying off. In
Denmark, 225 wild birds were analyzed in the period 15 Feb 2006 to 15 Mar
2006 with negative test results. However, following the detection of the
1st positive bird, on 14 Mar 2006, 26 additional H5-positive wild birds
have been confirmed between 15 Mar 2006 and 31 Mar 2006. Details, including
the precise species of each tested bird, are available at
<http://www.uk.foedevarestyrelsen.dk/AnimalHealth/Avian_influenza/Latest_news/Results_in_2006/forside.htm>.
The very low infection rate among the tested birds in Germany might be
misleading; the results should preferably be analyzed per species. In this
context, subscribers are referred to the following passage. - Mod.AS]

[The following observations from Uriel Safriel are a response to
ProMED-mail's commentary in posting 20060327.0935, which addressed the
rather simultaneous outbreaks in Beqaot and Kufrenjy, Israeli and Jordanian
poultry farms on the opposite sides of the Jordan river. It was speculated
that a common, migratory-birds origin of infection might be involved. This
speculation was in view of the relative proximity of the 2 locations
separated by a border between which no contacts could have been
demonstrated, while both are located within the Jordan valley, a major
flyway. So far, no infection in wild birds has been reported from Israel,
Jordan or the Palestinian Authority territories. - Mod.AS]
Not finding many dead wild birds does not mean birds are not dying from the
disease. This is because, as a rule, it is very difficult to find dead wild
animals of any kind. When they are just starting to feel sick, their
behavior signals this to their predators, and they are predated. And if
they are not detected by predators but die of the disease, scavengers and
bacteria take care that, in a short while, nothing is left to find.
Only for large animals (say swans) is the story different, since they don't
have many predators, and it takes more time for the dead body to disappear.
I did not see, however, studies that compare spread of pathogens between
territorial and colonial birds. Also, territorial birds become
non-territorial in the non-breeding season and may then roost in big
aggregations. And, when on desert-crossing migration, many birds alight to
rest and refuel in small oases. There, individuals that otherwise always
keep a distance from each other come in nearly direct contact with each
other for a few days.
Again, I do not know of studies that compared the incidence of bird
pathogens in desert oases with the incidence in migratory birds off oases.
Eilat can be regarded as an oasis, and the US group that took blood samples
of migratory birds there decades ago did not have another research site
away from Eilat.
As to the Jordan valley cases: it is spring migration now, and the birds
come from Africa. It is likely that the area between the eastern
Mediterranean coast and the edge of the desert in Jordan is used by more
migrants coming from Africa than more northern areas, because by traveling
through this area, they can alight and feed/rest. This cannot be easily
done if they go through the Arabian Desert. But many small birds cross the
Mediterranean, and actually fly at night in a wide front, not necessarily
being funneled to a specific route, but rather take the shortest way to
where they breed in central and northern Europe and the fertile parts of
west Asia.
Soaring birds, on the other hand, avoid the Mediterranean and concentrate
along its eastern land mass (Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria), namely all
birds of prey, storks and pelicans. They come after a desert crossing, and
especially storks tend to stay for feeding in Israel before completing the
journey to central Europe. What the wildfowl are doing -- geese, ducks -- I
am not sure. Maybe they also circumvent the sea, and hence we (Israel) get
more of them. We also have birds that were not with us in the winter and
return now from Africa to breed.

Live Markets A Risk For Entry Of Bird Flu Into US
-----------------------------------------------
Live poultry markets can be a link between migratory birds, which may be
carrying the deadly H5N1 avian influenza virus, and domestic poultry
flocks, allowing the virus a portal to enter U.S. commercial poultry
flocks, said Charles Beard, an avian influenza expert. Speaking at a J.P.
Morgan-sponsored teleconference from New York on Thursday [30 Mar 2006],
Beard said there are about 85 live bird markets, where consumers can
purchase from a variety of birds offered for sale, within the New York City
metropolitan area. He expressed concerns that the bird flu virus could
enter such a market via migratory birds then be transmitted to other birds
and carried back to commercial flocks.
The highly pathogenic H5N1 Asian strain of avian influenza is deadly to
many avian species including domestic chickens, turkeys and other poultry.
The disease, commonly known as bird flu, is carried by migratory birds and
typically spreads along their flyways. Avian influenza comes in many forms,
most of which are low pathogenic variants that may not even result in
symptoms in infected birds. There are other ways the virus could find its
way into the U.S. as well, such as being carried in by migratory birds to
backyard flocks or via smuggled birds such as fighting cocks from countries
where bird flu cases have occurred, Beard said.
Beard said the most likely place for the virus to enter the country would
be in Alaska, which is on a flyway for migratory birds from southeast Asia
and Australia. Alaska is a key spot for the U.S., and the U.S. Department
of Agriculture has increased its surveillance there for avian influenza
6-fold, Beard said. As the Northern Hemisphere warms up, migration will
occur northward from Southeast Asia.
Concerning measures being taken by poultry producers in the U.S., Beard
said the industry is already utilizing biosecurity practices. However, if a
case of bird flu were to be discovered in Alaska, it would boost
biosecurity measures even more across the country.
Beard said there must be very strong efforts from government and industry
to keep the H5N1 bird flu virus out of the country. While he said he thinks
the virus could be eradicated from commercial flocks if it does arrive, it
would be more difficult to do now than when other forms of avian influenza
hit in the early 1900s, because there are so many more birds produced now.
The U.S. produces about 8 billion broilers a year.
He also said that as of Thursday [30 Mar 2006], there were 27 countries
with reported cases of the highly pathogenic H5N1 bird flu in commercial
poultry flocks. More have had isolated cases of the virus found in
migratory birds. Swans and some geese appear to be more susceptible to the
virus than other migratory birds.
Beard recommends that all commercial flocks be locked down for 3 days
before they are sent to slaughter, which would resolve the question about
the possibility that a flock could be mistakenly given a clean bill of
health a few days before slaughter then somehow become infected before
being shipped to a processor.
However, Beard sees no real risk for a mistaken identification of the
disease. He said the highly pathogenic avian influenza moves so rapidly
through poultry flocks that it would be obvious due to the death losses,
and no company would process sick or dying birds.
