Has there been an attempt to isolate _Clostridium perfringens_ from the
toad remains and the pond water? In Ontario, Canada, several of our urban
water bodies are off-limits for the swimming of dogs (and people, one
assumes) due to complications from _C. perfringens_, both as an enteric
pathogen and as an intertriginous [causing chafing] skin pathogen. Despite
its aversion to oxygen, _C. perfringens_ persists in pond water, especially
where fecal contamination is high. Due to the perverse toilet habits of
urban humanity, human and canine feces are washed into urban waterways by
rain run-off, producing a stagnant fecal bacterial culture.
Under the proper anaerobic condition, _C. perfringens_ will grow rapidly
and elaborate extravagant quantities of gas (hydrogen and carbon dioxide).
Trapped by mammalian skin and muscle it causes "gas gangrene". In the
abdomen of the toad, I can believe the gas could rapidly exceed the stretch
tolerance of skin.
I was able to find one paper about dipteran myiasis [infestation with fly
maggots] producing Clostridial infections in amphibians, although these
were frogs and I don't find any reference to explosions:
Souza Jr, F. L.; Hip"Lito, M.; Baldassi, L.; Martins, M. L. . Cases of
buccal myiasis in the bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana Shaw, 1802), with larvae
of Notochaeta sp.Aldrich, 1916 (Diptera: Sarcophagidae) in S"o Paulo,
Brasil. Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz Rio de Janeiro, v. 84, p. 517-8, 1989.

[Dr. Baker has provided some interesting information regarding clostridial
infections in amphibians. Although this event seems to be very newsworthy
and is of some concern from a disease or chemical standpoint, the testing
issue seems to have fallen through the proverbial cracks. If there are any
laboratory or investigative reports, we would appreciate the proper
authority sharing them with us. - Mod.TG]
