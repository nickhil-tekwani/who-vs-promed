Maine horse dies of eastern equine encephalitis
-----------------------------------------------
State health officials say a horse in Maine has died of eastern
equine encephalitis [EEE]. Dr Dora Anne Mills, director of the Maine
Center for Disease Control, says the horse died this week on a farm in Lebanon.

Mills said there are no reports of people getting the infection, but
she urged residents in southern Maine to take simple precautions
against mosquito bites such as wearing insect repellent and wearing
long sleeves.

Horse owners should also make sure their animals are vaccinated yearly.

Eastern equine encephalitis is an infection that can be transmitted
by mosquitoes and can be fatal or cause neurological problems.

[It is not often that we see a case of EEE this far north, although
this year (2008) we have seen cases in Canada as well.

It highlights the needs for horse owners to use multivalent vaccines
and continue to vaccinate yearly. Most vaccines come with West Nile
virus and eastern equine encephalitis in them.

Horses seem to be sentinel animals, acting as a hallmark of the
mosquito season. This should alert people to take precautions against
mosquitoes. - Mod.TG
