CDC is collaborating with public health officials in many states, the
Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service
(FSIS), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the State of
Rhode Island to investigate a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella
[enterica_] serotype Montevideo infections. Investigators are using
DNA analysis of _Salmonella_ bacteria obtained through diagnostic
testing to identify cases of illness that may be part of this outbreak.

As of 9:00 pm EST on 10 Feb 2010, a total of 225 individuals infected
with the outbreak strain of _S._ Montevideo, which displays either of
2 closely related PFGE patterns, have been reported from 44 states
and the District of Columbia since 1 Jul 2009. The number of ill
persons identified in each state with this strain is as follows: AK
(1), AL (2), AZ (6), CA (30), CO (4), CT (5), DC (1), DE (2), FL (3),
GA (3), IA (1), ID (2), IL (15), IN (3), KS (3), LA (1), MA (13), MD
(1), ME (1), MI (4), MN (5), MO (2), MS (1), NC (10), ND (1), NE (1),
NH (2), NJ (8), NM (2), NY (18), OH (9), OK (1), OR (9), PA (6), RI
(2), SC (1), SD (3), TN (5), TX (7), UT (9), VA (1), WA (17), WI (1),
WV (1), and WY (2). Because the main _S._ Montevideo outbreak PFGE
pattern is commonly occurring in the United States, public health
investigators may determine that some of the illnesses are not part
of this outbreak.

_Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Senftenberg, a different serotype of
_Salmonella_, has been found in food samples from retail and a
patient household during this outbreak investigation. PulseNet
identified 5 persons who had illness caused by _S._ Senftenberg with
matching PFGE patterns between 1 Jul 2009 and today [11 Feb 2010].
Public health officials have interviewed 4 of the 5 ill persons with
this strain of _S._ Senftenberg and determined that one consumed a
recalled salami product during the week before their illness began.
These 5 cases are not included in the overall case count reported above.

Among the persons with reported dates available, illnesses began
between 4 Jul 2009 and 24 Jan 2010. Infected individuals range in age
from less than one year old to 93 years old, and the median age is 39
years. 53 percent of patients are male. Among the 166 patients with
available information, 43 (26 percent) were hospitalized. No deaths
have been reported.

Investigation of the Outbreak
-----------------------------
During 16-21 Jan 2010, CDC and public health officials in multiple
states conducted an epidemiologic study by comparing foods eaten by
41 ill and 41 well persons. Preliminary analysis of this study has
suggested salami as a possible source of illness. Ill persons (58
percent) were significantly more likely than well persons (16
percent) to report eating salami. Additionally, 16 ill persons have
been identified who purchased the same type of sliced salami variety
pack at different grocery store locations before becoming ill; 2
additional ill persons have been identified who purchased a similar
type of sliced salami deli tray before becoming ill. These data
suggest this product is the source of some of these illnesses. This
sliced salami variety pack was recently recalled by Daniele
International Inc. CDC and public health officials in multiple states
continue to interview ill persons to ask them about the foods they
ate during the week before they became ill as well as to collect
shopper card information.

Recall Information
------------------
On 23 Jan 2010, FSIS issued a news release that Daniele International
Inc. is recalling approximately 1 240 000 pounds of ready-to-eat
varieties of Italian sausage products (including salame/salami) in
commerce and potentially available to customers in retail locations
because they may be contaminated with salmonella. On 4 Feb 2010, FSIS
updated its 23 Jan 2010 news release to include 2 additional
salame/salami products, adding approximately 23 754 pounds to the
initial recall. These products can have an extended shelf life of up
to one year. The manufacturer has voluntarily halted production of
salami products.

This initial recall followed isolation of _Salmonella_ in a private
laboratory from a retail sample of a salami product produced by
Daniele International; this product was different than the sliced
salami variety pack purchased at different grocery store locations by
the 16 ill persons. FSIS reviewed and affirmed these private
laboratory results. The strain initially found by the private
laboratory was different from the strains causing the outbreak.
However, the Washington State Department of Health subsequently
tested the bacterial culture provided by the private laboratory (the
salami was not provided) and identified 2 different Salmonella
serotypes, the strain found by the private lab and _S._ Montevideo
indistinguishable from the outbreak strain and _S._ Senftenberg. In
addition, the Iowa Department of Public Health and public health
officials in Plymouth County, Iowa investigated a patient with _S._
Montevideo infection indistinguishable from the outbreak strain and
discovered an open sliced salami variety pack frozen at the patient's
home. The patient had eaten this product before becoming ill. This
sliced salami variety pack was the same as that purchased by 16 other
ill persons. Using DNA analysis, the University of Iowa Hygienic
Laboratory (Iowa's public health laboratory) confirmed that the
salmonella isolated from this leftover salami was indistinguishable
from the outbreak strain of _S._ Montevideo.

On 31 Jan 2010, FSIS issued a 2nd news release that Daniele
International Inc. has expanded its recall to include more
ready-to-eat (RTE) varieties of Italian sausage products.

The recall was being expanded as a result of a confirmed finding of
strain in an unopened salami product reported by the Illinois
Department of Public Health. The product was sampled during the
course of an ongoing investigation of a multistate outbreak of
_Salmonella_ serotype Montevideo illnesses. The product tested was
not included in the previous recall (FSIS Recall 006-2010) issued on
23 Jan 2010 but is similar to products bought by customers who later
became sick and were identified as part of the Montevideo
investigation. The company believes that black pepper is a possible
source of salmonella contamination.

Further testing is ongoing at a state health partner laboratory and
might determine if the product tested in Illinois contained the _S._
Montevideo strain associated with the multistate outbreak.

Recent test results provided by the Rhode Island Department of Health
revealed that an opened container of black pepper used in the
manufacturing of at least some of the recalled products was positive
for _S._ Montevideo and that the DNA fingerprint matched the outbreak
strain: <http://www.ri.gov/press/view/10647>.

The FDA is investigating the supply chain of the black pepper used in
the manufacturing of the recalled meat products. The Agency has
collected and is currently analyzing black pepper samples. To date,
all the samples collected and analyzed by the FDA have tested
negative for salmonella; however, sample collection and analysis continue.

[How important the 2nd isolate will become is not yet clear. As
discussed further below, a significant number of the cases are not
clearly linked to the recalled products. It is possible that other
products containing the potentially contaminated pepper are playing a
major role here. - Mod.LL]

Tests have shown that the same strain of salmonella that sickened
more than 200 people in at least 42 states has been found in black
pepper, but it's not clear if it's the only source of the outbreak,
the state health department announced Wednesday [3 Feb 2010].

The tests traced the salmonella to closed containers of ground black
pepper that would have been used to coat salami at Daniele Inc., a
meat company in Burrillville, RI, health department spokeswoman
Annemarie Beardsworth said. [This is not clearly stated in the CDC
reports. - Mod.LL]

Beardsworth said about half the people sickened didn't eat any
salami. "That maybe tells you that we're not done looking for a
source of the outbreak yet," she said.

Daniele had 2 suppliers for the pepper, and the U.S. Department of
Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration are working to trace
its origin and determine if it was distributed anywhere else,
Beardsworth said. "It was imported, and any pepper that is now coming
into the country is going to be subject to additional testing," she said.

She said it was not yet known which country the pepper came from and
whether it was sold directly to consumers or used in prepared foods.
