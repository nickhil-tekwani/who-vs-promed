Parks Canada is vowing to step up its efforts to control bovine
tuberculosis (TB) in the wild elk herd at Riding Mountain National Park
after tests confirmed 2 elk had the disease and 8 more are probable.
A news release issued jointly last week by Parks Canada and the Canadian
Food Inspection Agency noted the overall incidence of TB in wildlife is
still believed low, but its presence remains a serious concern.
Greg Fenton, field unit superintendent at Riding Mountain, said the effort
will include targeting animals within the western half of the park for herd
reduction. That is the area where the disease continues to be found.
The extent of the elk kill is not known. The goal until now has been to
reduce the park's overall elk population to 2500 from 2700 animals. Fenton
said Parks Canada will also broaden its elk test and cull program to learn
the overall prevalence of TB in wildlife throughout the entire park. The
federal government estimates TB is present in 1 to 5 percent of the park's
elk herd.
Other measures will continue, including barrier fencing to help prevent elk
from feeding on stored hay and mingling with area cattle herds.
"This is a serious issue," said Fenton, "and we will continue to play a
leadership role."
The latest confirmation of infected elk arose out of the Manitoba Bovine
Tuberculosis Management Program. Under the program, 116 wild elk from the
west side of the park were captured and tested over the 2002-2003 winter.
For years, the wild elk were considered a potential source to spread the
disease to cattle. Larry Schweitzer, vice-president of the Manitoba Cattle
Producers Association, said the latest findings support that concern.
"This is going to force Parks Canada into doing something about it. We're
all in favor of that, that's for sure."
Earlier in 2003, the CFIA discovered 3 cattle herds around the park were
infected with bovine TB. A fourth herd was considered exposed. About 250
head of cattle were slaughtered as a result.
Maria Koller-Jones, senior staff veterinarian for the CFIA's animal Health
and production division, said the latest findings support the belief that
wild elk are the likely source of reinfection in cattle. She commended
Parks Canada for its commitment to the test and cull program, noting that
parks staff worked diligently to capture the elk for testing and to
recapture those where testing revealed suspicion of the disease.
Because of the discovery of the disease in cattle herds, all Manitoba
cattle that were being exported to the United States for breeding purposes
had to undergo a TB test, pending a review of the need for that requirement
by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). A date for that review will
not be set until the bovine spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) issue is
resolved and the border reopened. Then CFIA can ascess the new state of
cattle and beef exports to the U.S., Koller-Jones said.
The CFIA has established a disease eradication program around Riding
Mountain, partly in an effort to zone the area so export restrictions on
breeding cattle being sent to the U.S. from elsewhere in the province might
one day be removed.
Schweitzer said cattle producers are concerned the zoning effort could be
jeopardized by elk moving outside the disease eradication area, which the
USDA might figure means that bovine TB could move with them.

[TB can be spread by respiratory droplets where animals congregate to eat
hay. However, starvation of animals is not an option either. Generally
these outbreaks occur during the winter months when supplemental feeding is
necessary for animals. Preventing wild animals from feeding on hay in a
pasture situation is difficult, as is movement and control of wild animals.
In addition to the threat of transmission of tuberculosis to cattle, there
have been publications that reported the risk of transmission from elk
directly to humans.
