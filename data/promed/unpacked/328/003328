A new crisis has erupted in the northern war zone with a virtual
epidemic of dengue and chikungunya viral fever among troops due to
the heavy rains and resultant floods, officials said. Military
spokesperson Udaya Nanayakkara said urgent measures had been taken to
check the epidemic, while other officials disclosed that about 500
troops affected by the viral flu were being treated at hospitals in
the Anuradhapura district.

Provincial Health Director Dr. W. Atapattu said the health crisis had
arisen one month ago [end of February 2008] and the victims were
being treated at the Anuradhapura, Padaviya and Sampathnuwara
hospitals. Dr. Atapattu also said health education and viral flu
prevention activities were conducted in the affected areas and
mosquito nets being widely distributed. [Neither dengue nor
chikungunya virus infections are accurately termed "viral flu". That
term should be restricted to influenza virus infections. - Mod. TY]]

Other steps are also being taken to check and destroy mosquito
breeding sites. An official said the dengue or chikungunya mosquitoes
were breeding in various places including discarded cases of shells
used in the war.

Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital Director Dr. Sarath Weerabandara said
the outbreak began when unexpected heavy rains hit the area including
the war zones. He said blood samples sent to the Medical Research
Institute had confirmed that the virus was largely chikungunya.

[The virus causing this outbreak was termed "largely
chikungunya". That implies that there was also another virus,
perhaps dengue virus as suggested, involved as well. Since both
viruses are transmitted by the same _Aedes_ mosquito vectors, it is
certainly possible that both chikungunya and dengue viruses are being
transmitted at the same time in the same place. ProMED would
appreciate information concerning confirmation (or not) of dengue
virus(es) being involved in this outbreak. ProMED post 20080328.1154
reported the death of 4 individuals in the same area during the week
of 17 Mar 2008, with mention of a similar non-fatal disease outbreak
among the military troops in the area. Although the cause of death
was not determined, nor was the description of the clinical disease
detailed enough to speculate on the etiological agent involved,
previous repots of fatalities from dengue fever with cardiac
manifestations occurred during a dengue outbreak in the same area in 2005.
