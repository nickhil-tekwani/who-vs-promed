[With the addition of this newly confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection in Riyadh, this raises the Saudi total of laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV cases to 731 including 302 deaths. It is noteworthy that after a relatively quiet period of MERS-CoV activity beginning in mid-July 2014 when there were periods of 2-3 weeks between reported cases, there have been 4 newly confirmed cases in the past 7 days.

As mentioned in yesterday's post (archive no 20140915.2775327), the most recent global tally of laboratory MERS-CoV available comes from an ECDC risk assessment document with data from 20 Aug 2014, that gave a global tally of 855 cases including 333 deaths. Since then, there have been an additional 8 laboratory confirmed cases and 2 deaths reported by Saudi Arabia, bringing the global tally of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection to 863 including 335 deaths. (http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/Middle-East-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-Saudi%20Arabia-Qatar-Jordan-Germany-United-Kingdom.pdf).

According to the information provided on the Saudi Arabia MOH website site, this most recent case (the 39-year-old expat male in Riyadh), did not have a history of animal exposure, similar to the case reported in yesterday's update (see MERS-CoV (14): Saudi Arabia, new case 20140915.2775327). A colleague raised the question of whether "no animal contact" includes no contact with animal products such as unpasteurized camel milk, or raw camel meat. Given the apparent slight increase in sporadic cases of MERS-CoV now with less than a month until the major influx of persons from around the world comes for the Hajj period, the need for a timely identification of the transmission routes for these apparent sporadic cases seems crucial. Are there preliminary results of case control studies addressing this question that could be shared?
