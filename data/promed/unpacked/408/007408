Epidemiological comments: While conducting the serological testing of
all cloven-hoofed animals to lift the movement restrictions within the
FMD control zone established following the FMD outbreaks in
Cheongyang-gun, 9 serum samples collected from a wild boar farm were
tested positive for antibodies against FMD virus on 6 Jun 2010. After
re-collecting serum from the farm in question, 22 samples were
confirmed positive for antibodies against FMD virus by ELISA on 7 Jun
2010 by the National Veterinary Research and Quarantine Service.
However, FMD antigen was not detected by RT-PCR.

[In view of their sampling and re-sampling, it may be assumed that the
affected wild boars are housed; confirmation or otherwise will help.

This is the 5th outbreak in the centre-west of S. Korea
(Ch'ungch'ong-Budko and Cheongyang-gun provinces), where the 1st case
was confirmed on 22 Apr 2010. Another clustered epizootic, caused by
the same FMD serotype O virus, started earlier (8 Apr 2010) in the
northwest, namely in Inch'on-Jikhalsi, where a total of 8 outbreaks
have been confirmed so far. See, with map, at
