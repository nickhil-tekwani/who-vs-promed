A total of 81 cases of measles have now been confirmed in Nairobi
since the 1st case was reported in a refugee from the Somalian
community in the Eastleigh division of Nairobi in October [2005]. One
case of measles has also been confirmed in Turkana District.
Out of these 81 cases in Nairobi, 8 cases have been confirmed to be
nosocomial transmissions within health institutions treating measles
cases. Almost all the 81 cases had not been immunized.
In order to tackle the problem of nosocomial transmission, the
Director of Medical Services has directed all health institutions to
ensure that all children age 9 months to 5 years attending any health
facility for any other medical problem and who have not been
immunized with measles vaccine should be immunized.
The Ministry of Health has intensified the measles campaign in the
whole country with a media campaign to inform parents to bring their
unimmunized children for immunization. It is estimated that 1.2
million children in Kenya have not been immunized against measles.
Kenya's population is about 31 million.

[Measles is spread by airborne or droplet transmission. Individuals
are infectious from the beginning of the prodromal period (when the
1st symptom appears) to 4 days after the appearance of the rash. It
is one of the most highly communicable infectious diseases. The
incubation period is about 10 days (may range between 7 and 18 days)
with a further 2-4 days before the rash appears.
It was reported previously that the measles immunization coverage for
Eastleigh division of Nairabi is around 80 percent. The unimmunized
children were mostly migrants from Somalia and the refugee camps in
Northern Kenya. These communities did not use public health
facilities because they are suspicious of the authorities. The above
report records one of the unfortunate consequences of incomplete
vaccine coverage in a community. - Mod.CP]
