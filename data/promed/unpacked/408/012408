With 3 more children hailing from Kushinagar succumbing to encephalitis
today [4 Nov 2009], the toll due to the deadly brain fever has reached 481
since January [2009] in eastern districts of Uttar Pradesh.

Additional director of health LP Rawat said [in Gorakhpur] that 14 fresh
patients suffering from the fever were admitted to various hospitals in the
region. He said that a total of 2787 patients suffering from Japanese
encephalitis and acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) were admitted this year
[2009] to BRD Medical College Hospital [BRD MCH] and other hospitals of the
region. Of these, 481 died.

The additional director of health said that 174 patients suffering from
encephalitis are undergoing treatment at BRD MCH, while 9 patients are
admitted in government hospitals of adjoining districts.

[This report does not indicate the proportion of the 2787 cases that were
due to JE virus infection and that due to the unidentified etiologic agent
of acute encephalitis syndrome. A report from the USA Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention on a laboratory study of encephalitis patients from
this same area in Uttar Pradesh in 2006 reported that they identified an
etiologic agent in cerebrospinal fluid by using reverse transcription-PCR.
Their results showed positivity to enterovirus (EV) in 66 (22 per cent) of
306 patients. Sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of PCR products from 59
(89 per cent) of 66 specimens showed similarity with EV-89 and EV-76
sequences (see
<http://www.cdc.gov/eid/content/15/2/295.htm?s_cid=eid2957_e>). This may
account for the statement in the previous ProMED-mail post (archive no.
20091101.3773) that AES is related to contaminated water.

A ProMED-mail rapporteur raised the interesting possibility that Nipah
virus infection is another possible etiological agent causing encephalitis.
Apparently, Nipah virus has not been included in tests of recent cases. He
wrote, "I wonder if Nipah virus should be considered as a differential
diagnosis here. Mangos are a major crop in Uttar Pradesh (1), and the
_Pteropus_ spp fruit bats that have been associated with Nipah outbreaks in
Bangladesh and Malaysia feed on mangos (2). Fruit bats feeding and roosting
in mango trees and other fruit trees in and around piggeries are thought to
have been the source of the 1st reported Nipah outbreaks in Malaysia. The
index farm for the earliest known Nipah outbreak in Malaysia actually had a
large mango tree overhanging the piggery where the pigs became infected
(3). Pigs in the area could be tested for evidence of possible exposure to
Nipah virus. Pigs are both a principal amplifying host for JEV, and able to
acquire subclinical infections with Nipah virus (4). Interestingly,
although birds are considered the primary amplifying host for Japanese
encephalitis virus, research in Australia has indicated that at least one
species of _Pteropus_ bats can also become cryptically infected with JEV
and transmit the JEV virus to mosquitoes (5).
