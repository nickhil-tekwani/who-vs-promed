Out of the 38 635 people who contracted dengue fever throughout the
country [so far in 2005], 539 have died [a case fatality rate (CFR)
of 1395 per 100 000], Minister of Health Siti Fadilah Supari said on
Wednesday.
"The province with the highest number of dengue fever sufferers is
Jakarta with 10 847 and 57 deaths [a CFR of 526 per 100 000],
followed by East Java with 6007 sufferers and 84 deaths [a CFR of
1398]," Siti Fadilah said.
The minister explained that the highest incidence of dengue fever was
also registered in Jakarta with 96.4 cases per 100 000 people,
followed by East Kalimantan with 61.7, North Sumatra with 45.7,
Southeast Sulawesi with 35.2 and Bali with 34.8.
Compared to the number of dengue fever sufferers in the corresponding
period last year [2004], this year's incidence fell from 18.8 per 100
000 people to 16.6, she said.
The Ministry of Health in cooperation with other concerned
institutions has taken a number of measures to anticipate a possible
major outbreak of the disease by intensifying monitoring of new cases
and encouraging hospitals to accommodate an upsurge in the number of
patients, Siti Fadilah added.

Dengue kills another child as outbreak worsens
----------------------------------------------
One more child died of dengue fever on Wednesday as the outbreak
worsened in the capital.
Minister of Health Siti Fadhilah Supari said on Wednesday that
Jakarta had the highest number of dengue cases in Indonesia, with
East Java coming 2nd with 6007 cases.
She said that until 8 Aug 3005, the total number of dengue cases in
the country reached 36 499 in 31 provinces, with 498 dead from the
disease.
The City Health Agency said that as many as 61 dengue patients were
admitted into hospitals on Wednesday, but still declined to declare
the outbreak an emergency.
"According to our procedures the current condition is not yet
considered an emergency. However, we have anticipated every stage of
the outbreak," agency spokeswoman Zelfino told The Jakarta Post.
The city declares an emergency if 15 to 20 new cases are admitted
each day to a hospital.
Upon declaring an emergency, the administration would allocate special funds
and take extra measures, including a mass education campaign and special
medication efforts, to prevent the outbreak from spreading. [At that point, it
is already too late, due to all the cases in the incubation period infecting
mosquitoes. - Mod.JW]
The number of patients treated in hospitals in the capital increased
to 394 on Wednesday from 333 on Tuesday.
The highest number of cases occurred in East Jakarta with 119 people,
followed by South Jakarta with 109, West Jakarta 62, North Jakarta
60, and Central Jakarta with 54 people.
The total number of cases since January [2005] has reached 19 095 with 59
dead from the disease.
A 5-year-old boy from Kali Deres, West Jakarta was the latest victim
of dengue. He died on Tuesday evening after being treated at Budi
Asih Hospital in East Jakarta.
Zelfino refuted allegations that her office had done little to
prevent the disease from spreading as it did not quickly declare an
emergency.
"Just because we don't declare an emergency doesn't mean we do
nothing. We hold meetings with all community health centers every
Thursday to monitor the situation, and order them to accept every
dengue patient for free," she said.
Zelfino said her office had conducted a Friday program in which all
officials at every subdistrict in Jakarta urged people to drain their
open tanks, cover bathing tanks and bury used cans.
"We must acknowledge that many people have not joined the program yet.
Actually, if we do this consistently we can stop the spread of the disease,"
she said.
After Budi Asih in East Jakarta and Fatmawati Hospital in South
Jakarta, Pasar Rebo Hospital in East Jakarta and Koja Hospital in
North Jakarta have also run out of beds for dengue patients.
Pasar Rebo Hospital, which is handling 64 cases of dengue, has had to
place 22 patients along their terrace, while the Koja hospital, which
is treating dozens of patients, has to transfer several of their
patients to other hospitals.

16 new deaths from dengue
-------------------------
The Department of Health reports 16 new deaths from dengue and 1000
more new infections nationwide as cases continue to surge.
According to the latest Dept. of Health (DoH)-National Epidemiological Center
(NEC) dengue report, in a span of just 5 days, from 29 Jul to 3 Aug, the
number of deaths in 2005 has already risen to 159 from 143 and cases went up
from 10 977 to 12 308.
The total number of cases in 2005 is 15 percent higher compared to
the same period last year [2004] which saw 10 690 cases, DoH notes.
Epidemics and outbreaks where recorded by the DoH-NEC in 2 provinces:
Zamboanga City and Nueva Ecija. The outbreak in Zamboanga is now
under control, while cases in Gen. Tinio, Nueva Ecija continue to
increase and now stand at 99 cases with 2 deaths.
DoH-NEC recorded no current hot spots but noted clustering of cases (3 or more
cases in a span of 2 weeks) in barangays [districts] in Bukidnon (Poblacion,
Manolo Fortich; Kalunsugay, Malaybalay; Poblacion, Lantapan), Camiguin (Agoho
Mambajao; Bonbon, Catarman), and Misamis Oriental (Poblacion, Libertad;
Poblacion, El Salvador; Poblacion, Claveria).
Clustering of cases was observed in 13 barangays in Cagayan de Oro
city as well as in Quezon province. Other areas that have clustering
are Nueva Ecija, Bulacan, Malabon City and Manila (F. Varona Street
and Parola in Tondo; Anonas Street, Sta. Mesa; and Baseco Compound in
Port Area).
Barangay Pag-asa in Quezon City, which reported initially having 42
suspected dengue cases, has been confirmed to have only 2 cases from
24 to 30 Jul 2005.
Meanwhile, DoH advised parents to protect their kids who go to school
against dengue, as records show they are the ones prone to be bitten
by the day-biting _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito.
NEC records reveal that most of the victims of dengue are children (43
percent) and many of them go to school. [Most adults are already immune to the
dengue types circulating in the country. - Mod.JW].
"The dengue-carrying mosquito, called _Aedes aegypti_, only attacks
during daytime, the time when our kids are out of our homes and in
schools," said Dr. Vito Roque, head of the surveillance unit of the
DoH National Epidemiological Center.
Last month [July 2005], an elementary school in Pangasinan panicked
after 6 of its students were diagnosed to be suffering from dengue.
Roque said parents can protect their kids from being bitten by
mosquitoes by applying mosquito repellant to their skin.
DoH also reminded school officials to engage in clean-up activities
at least once a week and pay attention to the removal of possible
breeding grounds of mosquitoes such as cans, bottles, used tires, and
clogged gutters that can accumulate water.
Water in flower vases should be replaced every 7 days and all water
containers should be covered tightly.
_Aedes aegypti_ lays eggs in standing water. The adult mosquitoes
seek dark places.

Dengue cases in Negros Occidental now 574
-----------------------------------------
Negros Occidental has now had 574 dengue cases from January to July 2005.
Based on their records, Dr. Luisa Efren, provincial health officer,
said there has been a 40 percent increase in the number of cases
compared to the same period in 2004, which had total of only 373
cases.
There were also 2 deaths recorded in the latest PHO provincial health office)
monitoring. This is the reason why Efren had already raised the alert status
in the entire province on dengue. But she clarified that there is [not yet an]
epidemic and there is [no reason for public panic].
Efren, therefore, asked all Negrenses to be aware about the common
symptoms of dengue, which include high fever and flu, itchiness on
the stomach, nausea and vomiting.
She also enjoined all Negrenses to observe and be advocates of the 4
o'clock habit, a daily [regimen] that [includes] the burning of
garbage at 4 p.m. to produce smoke that will drive away
dengue-carrier mosquito -- "_Aedes aegypti_."
[Daily elimination] of breeding places -- especially flowerpots, mini
fishponds, among other bodies of stagnant water -- is also suggested.
Meanwhile, Dr. Jovy Vergara, assistant health officer of Bacolod, asked
Bacolenos not to kill or gather spiders for derby purposes. Vergara stressed
that spiders are predators that could deter the spread of dengue-carrying
mosquitoes. He said spiders usually trap mosquitoes in their webs for food.

Philippine public urged to help fight dengue, which has killed 143
------------------------------------------------------------------
The Philippine government on Sunday urged the public to work with
health authorities in efforts to prevent an outbreak of dengue, which
has already killed 143 people in the country since the start of 2005.
Presidential spokesman Ignacio Bunye said President Gloria Macapagal
Arroyo has directed the Department of Health (DOH) to coordinate with
local government in affected areas.
"The president is satisfied with the anti-dengue measures being
implemented by the DOH," he said. "We also urge the public to help
our health authorities. Let us keep our surroundings clean,
especially areas where mosquitoes can breed."
According to the DOH, a total of 10 977 cases of dengue have been
recorded throughout the country from January to July, up 9 per cent
from 10 117 cases in the same period last year [2004].
During the 7-month period, 143 people have died [a CFR of 1303 per
100 000], mostly children, the DOH added. But it did not release
comparative figures for the deaths during the same period of 2004.
Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease that is endemic to the
Philippines. Its symptoms are high fever that could last 2-10 days
and headache, accompanied by loss of appetite, vomiting, red skin
rashes and abdominal pain.

Dengue increases in 19 Brazilian states
---------------------------------------
The Secretary of Health Surveillance reports that after 2 years of decreasing
incidence, the number of dengue cases is increasing. From January through May
2005, 79 674 cases have been notified, 30 percent more than for the same
period last year (2004). There have been 72 cases of DHF and 5 deaths.
The greatest increase has been in the South, with an increase of 184 percent,
due mainly to Parana state, with 692 cases, followed by the North, with a 73
percent increase (26 934 cases). In the Northeast & West-Central regions the
increases were 51 percent, whereas the Southeast had a decrease of 27 percent,
with the states of Rio de Janeiro & Minas Gerais having the greatest decreases
of 35 percent � although they also had 10 cases of DHF (6 in Rio de Janeiro).
What is preoccupying about the increase is that this is occurring before the
traditional dengue season, which is during the rains in November, December &
January. Also, dengue type 4 has not been seen in Brazil since the 1980�s,
but is currently circulating in Venezuela, French Guiana, Colombia & Peru, all
neighboring countries to Brazil.
