Rice yellow mottle virus (RYMV), [a sobemovirus is the main virus
infecting rice (_Oryza sativa_) in Africa. First reported in Kenya,...RYMV
was later found in most countries of East and West Africa
[and...Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. In Central Africa however, the
disease had never been reported in rice fields.
98 field samples [expressing typical yellow mottle symptoms from
cultivated rice and 2 wild rice species (_O. longistaminata_ and _O.
barthii_) were collected in the Soudano-Sahelian zones, in...north[ern
Cameroon and...south[ern...Chad (Central Africa) in September 2000. RYMV
was detected by ELISA with polyclonal antisera (1) in all samples. All
virus isolates were also mechanically transmitted to rice cv. BG 90-2,
which is highly susceptible to RYMV. Tests with monoclonal antibodies
showed that most isolates from Central Africa were of the SI serotype,
which is widespread in the Soudano-Sahelian zones of West Africa (1).
The coat protein gene of 7 isolates was amplified by RT-PCR and the
expected 720 bp fragment was obtained. Resulting sequences (AJ306735,
AJ317949, AJ317950, AJ317951, AJ317952, AJ317953, AJ317954) shared over 95%
sequence identity. They were compared to a set of sequences of RYMV
isolates from cultivated rice of different geographical origins (2).
Phylogenetic analyses by maximum parsimony (PAUP 4) showed that isolates
from Central Africa belonged to a monophyletic group, a sister group of
West African isolates from the Soudano-Sahelian zones, further supporting
the geographic basis of RYMV diversity (2). RYMV incidence was generally
less than 10% but reached 20% in some irrigated plots in the 2 countries.

[RYMV was first reported in rice from Kisumu, Kenya in 1970. Diseased rice
plants express yellow or orange leaves, are stunted, and tillering and seed
production are reduced. The virus is transmitted by beetles (_Sessilia
pusilla_, _Trichispa serica_ and _Dicladispa viridicyanea_) (Coleoptera)
and by mechanical inoculation. It is not seed-transmitted. In addition to
its presence in Madagascar, RYMV is present in many African countries. On
the basis of sequencing the coat protein (CP) gene and the 3' untranslated
region, 5 major strains (3 in West Africa and 2 in East Africa) have been
differentiated. RYMV isolates originating in closely related
agro-ecological zones displayed variability in coat protein that should be
considered in the development of tolerant or resistant cultivars.
