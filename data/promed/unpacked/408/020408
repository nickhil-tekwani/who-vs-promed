Anthrax season starts early
--------------------------
New South Wales has had an early start to the anthrax season, with 2
properties already suffering stock losses. The state normally sees
about 4 cases of stock losses from anthrax each year.
Catherine Taragel says the large number of animals being turned onto
cereal crops is expected to create far more problems this year
[2006]. "We have had an early start to the summer period, and we have
started to see anthrax cases," she said.
"The vaccination is very good at preventing losses in stock, but you
really need to do that if you are in a high risk area, which [you]
would be if you have had deaths on your property previously or in the
region, say your neighbor's property, or there is historical
knowledge of anthrax being in that area."

[And that is all the news report said. Further information is being
requested from my Aussi colleagues. In the meanwhile, this same
source had 2 interesting stories:
(1) Patchy rainfall welcomed across NSW [3 Nov 2006]
<http://www.abc.net.au/rural/news/content/2006/s1780732.htm>,
(2) Dry forces cattle sell-off
<http://www.abc.net.au/rural/news/content/2006/s1780739.htm>,
both of which indicate a lot of climatic stress in the NSW cattle
rearing region. A quick check of the present weather in NSW has at
best scattered showers near the coast but high humidity inland. It is
Spring in NSW:
