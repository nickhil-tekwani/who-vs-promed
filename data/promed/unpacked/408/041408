Please tell me, if Cyclospora can not be washed off and is not rendered
non-infective by cooking, what methods of food preparation will prevent
Cyclospora infection?
[Although the definitive studies remain to be done, moderate cooking would
appear to protect against infection with cyclospora. The pesto sauce in
this outbreak probably contained fresh or inadequately cooked basil. Many
spices are irradiated but I suspect this basil was not. Mod. pc]
