Foresters in overdrive mode to save Gir lion from anthrax
---------------------------------------------------------
Last week's [16-22 Jun 2008] anthrax incident that took a toll of at
least 8 cattle in Bagdana village of Bhavnagar district has put the
forest officials on a high alert, forcing them to take preventive
measures to protect the Asiatic Gir lion from the dreaded cattle
disease.

In a related development, the state Animal Husbandry Department has
requisitioned 1500 doses of anti-anthrax vaccine that are being
dispatched to Bagdana village where veterinary doctors attached to
the epidemic cell of the department have launched a concerted drive
to quarantine the cattle. Last week, anthrax claimed the lives of 5
cows and 3 buffaloes in the village. "Following the outbreak of
anthrax in Bagdana, we have started taking several preventive
measures in the vicinity of the affected villages to protect the
Asiatic lion. Water holes are being disinfected, the grazing areas
are being burnt to drive away the Big Cats from the disease-hit
areas," PCCF (Wildlife) Pradeep Khanna told The Indian Express on
Thursday [19 Jun 2008].

Khanna said his department had also formed several teams comprising
foresters, beat guards, and officers that have fanned out in the
nearby Gebar forest areas to monitor the movement of Gir lions and
other wildlife. Local villagers are also assisting these teams to
take preventive measures initiated by the forest department. "We have
to ensure that lions do not occupy the peripheral region surrounding
the anthrax-hit village," he said, adding that wild animals were
often found occupying the grasslands in Palitana and Mahuva talukas
of Bhavnagar in search of prey.

Conservator of Forest (Junagadh Circle) MM Sharma said on phone that
the teams formed by the department have been constantly tracking the
Asiatic lions in the region to keep away the animals from the
vicinity of anthrax-hit villages. "At present, the lions occupy areas
12 km (7.5 mi) from Bagdana. We have to also ensure that the Big Cats
do not prey on local cattle or feed on carcass," said the forest
official.

As per the latest census, the total population of Asiatic lions is
pegged at 359. They are usually found occupying the forest area (Gir)
of Junagadh, Amreli, and Bhavnagar districts. Besides, there is large
population of other wild animals like leopards, jungle cats, blue
bulls, and jackals in these forest areas. "The Bagdana village is
about 200 km (124 mi) from the world famous Gir Wildlife Sanctuary,
and anthrax is localized. So, there is a remote possibility of the
fatal cattle disease hitting the lions in the sanctuary. However, we
are not taking any chances in the forest area of Bhavnagar district
where Bagdana is located," said the wildlife official.

[Anthrax is infrequently reported in Gujarat, but unfortunately not
unknown there with the result that control procedures are essentially
reactive instead of proactive, and thus less efficient and more
costly. If the Gujarat authorities can keep an eye on Bagdana and
make sure that their cattle are revaccinated for at least 3 more
years, it should not reappear.

Economic studies on anthrax control in Argentina and North Dakota --
unfortunately both have yet to be published -- both indicate a
positive benefit cost ratio in efficiently controlling this disease.
And here in southern Gujarat protecting the local lions has
additional significant benefits because of the tourist monies these
lions attract.

For information on the Asiatic Gir lion, go to

The Asiatic Lion is one of the 7 sub-species of lions on this planet.
Its scientific name is _Panthera leo persica_. Gir, popular name for
part of Gujarat in India is the only place where this magnificent
animal is found today. Asiatic lions feed on wild pigs, cattle,
antelope and deer in the wild. Present population of Asiatic Lion is
359 and is increasing every year because of conservation efforts of
local people and Government of Gujarat. The Gir Forests Reserve,
created in 1913 to protect the largest of the surviving groups of
Asiatic lion, was accorded sanctuary status in 1965. Several hundred
Asiatic lions have been bred in the sanctuary since it was
established.

In 1901, the King of Junagadh invited the then Viceroy Lord Curzon to
Gir for a hunt. Lord Curzon backed off at the last moment when as if
by providence a letter in a local newspaper criticised the damage a
Viceroy's visit would cause to a species on the verge of extinction.
Wisely, he requested the King to protect the last surviving animals
in his territory. The total lion population was around 20 when the
Nawab enforced a ban on hunting. This move resulted as the 1st
conservation effort for the continuous well being of the lions.

After India got its independence from British rule in 1947, the
government had come to realise the importance and fragile nature of
this last bastion of the Asiatic lion, and the Nawab's lion
conservation policy was upheld. Naturalists were assigned to study
and take a census of the Gir's lion population, which at that time
was around 200 lions.

The Indian government then created the Gir National Park and Lion
Sanctuary -- collectively known as the Gir Protected Area (PA),
covering over 1000 sq km (386 sq mi). The sanctuary area is made up
of dry scrubland with hills, rivers, and teak forest. In addition to
the lion population, the wildlife attractions of Gir PA includes
leopards, antelopes, deer, jackals, hyenas, and marsh crocodiles.
