African swine fever [ASF] has been detected on 3 farms in Viet Nam, authorities said on [Tue 19 Feb 2019], the 1st confirmed cases of the highly contagious disease in the Southeast Asia country.

All pigs on the farms located in Hung Yen and Thai Binh provinces, southeast of the capital Hanoi, were culled, the Animal Health Department said in a statement.

The disease, which is incurable in pigs but harmless for humans, has spread rapidly across neighboring China since August [2018], affecting 25 provinces and regions.

"The disease is not infectious for humans, so people and farmers shouldn't panic," Pham Van Dong, head of the department, told a press conference in Hanoi.

Pork accounts for 3/4 of total meat consumption in Viet Nam, a country of 95 million people where most of its 30 million farm-raised pigs are consumed domestically.

With pork such a popular meat in many Asian countries, UN experts said last September [2018] the spread of the virus to China's neighbors was a near certainty, and likely through movements of products containing infected pork.

Nguyen Van Long, the department's chief of epidemiology, said smuggling of animals across borders and tourism made it difficult to control the spread of the disease.

Taiwan's official Central News Agency reported on [Fri 15 Feb 2019] that the country's Council of Agriculture had found the virus in a sandwich carried from Viet Nam to Taiwan on 5 Feb 2019.

Authorities in Taiwan and Viet Nam are working to determine the origin of the pork found in the sandwich, Viet Nam's animal health department said.

[Viet Nam borders on its northern frontier 2 of China's 25 ASF-infected provinces, namely Guanxi and Yunnan.

The spread of the virus to is not surprising. Since the start of ASF in China, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has issued a warning that the outbreaks in mainland China will almost inevitably spread to other Asian countries. FAO chief veterinary officer Lubroth said: "Unfortunately, what we have seen so far is only the tip of the iceberg."

Viet Nam's domestic pig population is nearly 30 million strong. There is also a considerable local wild boar population. - Mod.AS
