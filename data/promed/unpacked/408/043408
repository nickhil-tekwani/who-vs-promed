----------------------------------------------------------------------
I am concerned about some of the wording in the [11 Jun 2014] posting. I realize that this report is from a newspaper and thought perhaps someone working in the program would comment. Since no one has, I will. By way of background, I have been active in leprosy control for decades and served as a WHO consultant in a number of countries. I made 4 visits to the Solomon Islands for WHO, the last in 1996.

The 1st line of the posting states, "there's an outbreak of leprosy". Primarily because of the long incubation period but also because of varying host immunity, leprosy does not occur in outbreaks. If indeed all of the 24 people have newly diagnosed leprosy, it is likely that they have been diagnosed at the same time because they came to the displaced people's centers and received medical attention, not because they all just developed leprosy.

The posting does not tell who made the diagnosis or how the diagnosis was made. There are few people skilled in the clinical diagnosis of leprosy in any country. In countries with scarce resources and integration of leprosy control services into the general health care or general public health system, in contrast to vertical programs, which were the standard when leprosy was more common, there may be little clinical expertise. Without knowing the clinical findings or other information on which the diagnosis of leprosy was made in the group of 24, I maintain some skepticism about the report.

Having said that, the geography and topography of the Solomon Islands do make it possible to having groups of people who are difficult to reach. I visited 2 provinces and even getting to some communities on Guadalcanal took significant car, boat, and foot travel. Thus it is conceivable that there are villages where leprosy has gone undetected. I doubt that this is the case and certainly did not think so when I was active in that country, but I am not familiar with the current leprosy control program in the Solomon Islands.

[Many thanks for Dr Frankel's comments that come from his personal experience with leprosy control in the Solomon Islands as a WHO consultant.

Solomon Islands is a constitutional monarchy with currently Queen Elizabeth II of the UK, as its head of state; it consists of a large number of islands in Melanesia, Oceania lying to the east of Papua New Guinea and northwest of Vanuatu and covering a land area of 28 400 sq km (11 000 sq mi) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Islands). The country's capital, Honiara, is located on the island of Guadalcanal. A map of Oceania, on which the Solomon Islands are found, can be accessed at http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/g(ocea.html. - Mod.ML
