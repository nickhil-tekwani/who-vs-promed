PARIS, Feb 9 - France on Monday reported a new case of BSE, the 33rd
incident in the country since 1990.
The affected cow, in a herd in the Savoie area near the French Alps, was
born in 1988 before a 1990 ban was imposed on cattle feed containing
ground-up animal parts, the Farm Ministry said in a statement. The 11 cows
in the herd were slaughtered over the weekend. An additional 67 cows were
also destroyed in the Haute-Savoie area because the diseased cow was born
and raised with that herd until December 1995.

[A not uncommon marketing pattern is for cows culled from good herds to be
bought by marginal small-herd owners for breeding purposes and whatever
productivity remains. If this is the case here, as it appears, it might
explain how this cow survived so long. - Mod.MHJ
