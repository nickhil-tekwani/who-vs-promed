A Comment on Hepatitis A in Russia
----------------------------------
With regard to the posts on hepatitis A in Russia [Hepatitis A - Russia:
update (01) 13 Feb 2001 20010214.0291 and the information from the GIDEON
database [Hepatitis A - Russia: background 20010214.0297, I make the
following comment.
While I haven't worked in hepatitis specifically, I have worked in
infectious disease in the former Soviet Union for a couple of years.
Information on hospitalizations can be misleading. Individuals who in the
West would be treated conservatively as an outpatient for acute hepatitis A
are routinely hospitalized in the former Soviet Union; a holdover from
original sanitary/hygienic/epidemiologic practice. Hospitalization is
generally required for reportable infectious diseases, which includes
hepatitis A. What at first blush sounds quite serious and unusual (40
hospitalizations for hepatitis A) may in fact be much less so. (Not that it
couldn't be serious; just that raw hospitalization data does not
demonstrate anything.)
