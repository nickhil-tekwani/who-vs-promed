[From reliable sources, we note that the satisfactory situation in the Gaza strip, namely absence of additional outbreaks, as reported in the above follow-up report, remains unchanged as of 22 May 2012. This is most fortunate, indicating that the measures applied by the Palestinian veterinary services were timely, effective and sufficient, preventing spread of the SAT2 virus after its introduction from Egypt. These steps included 2 components: quarantine/animal movement restrictions and vaccination of all cattle holdings within the Gaza strip.

It is interesting to note that in spite of the fact that the (estimated) 80 000 sheep and goats in the Gaza strip have not yet been vaccinated with an SAT 2 vaccine, no cases have been recorded among them so far. Although this may reflect effective isolation of the infected cattle, it may also reflect a characteristic of the virus strain involved. Is FMDV SAT 2 (topotype VII) infective/pathogenic for sheep/goats, as it is for cattle and buffaloes? Information from Egypt, where the same strain circulates, will help. Such data will be helpful for the assessment of the dynamics of this epizootic and for the planning of its regional control. Pre-vaccination serosurvey in sheep and goats in the Gaza strip could provide useful information.

Have experimental infection trials with the said virus strain in different animal species (particularly ovine, caprine, porcine) been considered? - Mod.AS
