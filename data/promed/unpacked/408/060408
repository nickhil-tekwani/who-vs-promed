-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A total of 575 commercial grapevine (_Vitis vinifera_) samples from Australia have been tested for a newly emerging virus, _Grapevine Pinot gris virus_ (_Trichovirus_, Betaflexiviridae) during 2015-2017. 9 samples from 2 states tested positive. 6 of these were from New South Wales and 3 from South Australia in a total of 8 varieties. All these varieties were imported from Europe within the last 4-19 years.

A fragment of 431 nucleotides on the coat protein gene of _Grapevine Pinot gris virus_ was targeted for virus identification by RT-PCR. Each positive sample showed an identity of up to 99.3 per cent to the virus sequences in the NCBI database. The phylogenetic tree as well as pairwise sequence [comparison] showed that, although the virus sequence in each variety was unique, they all grouped with the isolates from Europe and well away from the South Korean and several Chinese isolates. This is the 1st report of the occurrence of _Grapevine Pinot gris virus_ in Australia.

[_Grapevine Pinot gris virus_ (GPGV; genus _Trichovirus_) is a newly described virus of grapevine which was identified in Italy on cv. Pinot gris vines with symptoms of chlorotic mottling and leaf deformations. It was detected by new large scale sequencing methods ("deep sequencing") in co-infection with several other viruses and viroids. Therefore, it was initially not possible to clearly associate the virus with specific symptoms.

Amongst the grapevine viruses, GPGV appears to be most closely related to _Grapevine berry inner necrosis virus_ (GINV) of the same genus. Trichoviruses are mostly transmitted by grafting material and mechanical means, and GINV is also transmitted by a mite vector. Work is in progress to investigate symptomatology (alone and in co-infections), possible vectors, epidemiology and impact of GPGV.

Disease management of grapevine viruses and viroids may include phytosanitation, such as removal of infected plants and disinfection of vineyard tools. Use of certified clean planting material (including tissue cultures, rootstocks, and scions for grafting) is essential.

Previously, GPGV had been reported from Europe, North America, and Asia. The report above is its 1st report in Australasia and Oceania. Given the vegetative propagation methods used for grapevines, longevity of the host and historic international exchange of germplasm, it may be widely distributed in some or many commercial cultivars.
