A virus that causes blisters on swine that looks similar to FMD is popping up again in the northwestern corn belt. Minnesota Pork Executive Director Dave Preisler says Seneca Virus initially showed up in the United States in 2002 and has recently re-emerged in the region.

Preisler says Seneca virus is easy to identify, and [advises] producers to check their herds for symptoms.

He says if you see the virus, notify your veterinarian immediately.

Preisler says producers can go on line at <www.swinehealth.org> and get regular updates on Seneca virus as well as tips on what disinfectants to use.

[Seneca Valley Virus (SVV) is a single-stranded RNA virus in the family Picornaviridae. It is closely related to the genus Cardiovirus, and has been recently proposed to be classified in the genus Senecavirus, along with other closely related porcine picornaviruses [1]. Seneca Valley virus is a newly discovered virus that was originally isolated as a contaminant in cell culture medium; its complete genome sequence and structure has been recently published [1,2]. Furthermore, SVV has been reported to be associated with cases of idiopathic vesicular disease in pigs originating from several different locations in Manitoba [3].Several cases of non-debilitating erosions and vesicles on the snout, oral cavity, skin and coronary bands have been infrequently described in pigs over many years without an identifiable cause and thus, were grouped under Swine Idiopathic Vesicular Disease (SIVD) syndrome [4].

Outbreaks of SIVD are primarily observed between the spring and fall months [3]. SIVD grossly and histologically resembles vesicular foreign animal diseases, which are clinically and economically important. Cases of SIVD have been reported in New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Florida, Iowa and most recently Indiana [3,5-8]. In the most recent cases, vesicular foreign animal diseases were ruled out, and testing for other infectious diseases and microscopic evaluation of the lesions did not reveal a causative agent [3,5]. Similar vesicular lesions in pigs have been associated with the feeding of murine products in Australia and feeding of _Sclerotinia sclarotiorum_-infected celery, parsnips and carrots from New Zealand [7,8]. Other potential causes for vesicular lesions in pigs include porcine parvovirus, porcine enterovirus group III, calicivirus (San Miguel sea lion virus), mycotoxins and contact dermatitis [9-13]. The purpose of this report is to provide more descriptive pathology obtained from an isolated and sporadic case of idiopathic vesicular disease in a pig. In this pig, SVV was identified from the vesicular lesions by using Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR).
