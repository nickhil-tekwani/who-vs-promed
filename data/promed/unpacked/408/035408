Measures against avian influenza in Italy
-------------------------------------------
The European Commission has approved today a vaccination programme against
avian influenza in the Veneto and Lombardy regions of Northern Italy, and
imposed restrictions on the movements of live birds, hatching eggs, table
eggs and fresh poultry meat in the said regions.
Avian influenza is a highly contagious disease, caused by a virus,
affecting birds. There are 2 forms of the virus, a mildly pathogenic and a
highly pathogenic strains, both able to cause epidemics. A transformation
of one form into the other one may result from mutation of the virus.
During an epidemic of the disease in Italy in 1999-2000, 14 million birds
died or were killed, with consequent considerable losses to the poultry
industry.
In October 2002, the presence of a low pathogenic avian influenza [LPAI]
virus was confirmed, within the framework of surveillance activities, in
the Veneto and Lombardy regions. The Italian authorities have acted
energetically, including the elimination of affected flocks, in order to
stop the propagation of the virus and to prevent its possible mutation into
a highly pathogenic variant. The current vaccination is meant to protect
the enterprises at risk.
A scientific report on avian influenza is available on the internet at the
site <http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/fs/sc/scah/outcome_en.html>.

[The current outbreak of LPAI in northern Italy was, as reported by SIPA
(the Italian section of the World Veterinary Poultry Association),
initially serologically detected in mid-October, caused by LPAI type H7N3.
Since then, more than 100 foci were reported, of which at least 80
laboratory confirmed (see in the Italian web-site of SIPA,
<http://www.patologiaviare.org/ >).The cases have been recorded in 2
adjacent provinces - Brescia (Lombardy region) and Verona (Veneto region).
Among the measures adopted by the authorities in both affected regions, as
described in a 6 Nov 2002 official report of Italy to the EU, the following
may be of interest:
1. No restocking of turkey farms
2. Movement of hatching eggs, day-old-chicks, ready-to-lay-pullets, poultry
for slaughter within and outside both provinces must be authorised
3. Serological monitoring of all poultry farms
4. Virological monitoring (commercial ELISA test for antigen detection) of
turkey farms
5. Strict biosecurity measures have been enforced since July this year in
both regions.
To these measures, vaccination has now been added. It seems that the
decision to vaccinate has been taken in view of the continuing spread of
the disease. Most countries would not allow vaccinations against HPAI since
that might interfere with disease eradication measures, but would allow
vaccinations against LPAI.
The LPAI vaccines, used in the USA and Italy, are known to be prepared from
infective allantoic fluid inactivated by beta-propiolactone or formalin and
emulsified with mineral oil. The use of such vaccines in an EU
member-country needs the approval of the European Commission. The current
official regulation of the LPAI vaccination in Italy (Italian decree N.
0487 of 19 Dec 2002) and the programme of the emergency vaccination, can be
seen at
<http://www.oevr.org/news/influenza_aviare%202002/f_indice_influenza.htm>
Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) is an OIE list A disease; however,
LPAI is not reportable and is not included in the OIE lists A nor B
diseases. The diagnostic procedures for the determination of the
pathogenicity of isolated AI viruses, as well as the requirements from AI
vaccines, are specified in the OIE Manual of standards for diagnostic tests
and vaccines <http://www.oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/A_00035.htm>.
Whereas all virulent strains isolated so far have been either of the H5 or
H7 subtype, most H5 or H7 isolates have been of low virulence. Such was
also the LPAI outbreak in the USA (Virginia and North Carolina), earlier this
year, caused by "low pathogenic H7N2 virus".
The methods used for the determination of strain virulence for birds have
evolved over recent years with a greater understanding of the molecular
basis of pathogenicity, but still primarily involve the inoculation of a
minimum of 8 susceptible 4-8-week-old chickens with infectious virus;
strains are considered to be highly pathogenic if they cause more than 75
percent mortality within 10 days. However, in some cases the morbidity and
mortality, and subsequent economical losses, caused by LPAI strains in the
field, may be significant. -Mod. AS]
