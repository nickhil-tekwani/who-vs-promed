[The following chronological list, summarising the main events since the
beginning of the current H5N1 panzootic as well as relevant research, is
copied -- with some editorial modifications -- from the WHO influenza home
page. Only the animal-health related column is presented here; however,
research from the public-health column is included as well. - Mod.AS]
H5N1 influenza time-line: 28 Oct 2005
-------------------------------------
1.1996 Highly pathogenic H5N1 virus is isolated from a farmed goose in
Guangdong Province, China.
2. 1997 Outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 are reported in poultry at
farms and wet markets in Hong Kong.
3. Mid-2003: H5N1 virus begins to cause outbreaks in Asia, but these go
undetected and unreported.
4. Dec 2003: 2 tigers and 2 leopards, fed on fresh chicken carcasses, die
unexpectedly at a zoo in Thailand. Subsequent investigation identifies H5N1
in tissue samples. This is the 1st report of influenza causing disease and
death in big cats.
5. 19 Dec 2003: Republic of Korea confirms highly pathogenic H5N1 as cause
of poultry deaths at 3 farms.
6. 8 Jan 2004: Viet Nam reports H5N1 in poultry.
7. 12 Jan 2004: Japan reports H5N1 in poultry.
8. 23 Jan 2004: Thailand reports H5N1 in poultry.
9. 24 Jan 2004: Cambodia reports H5N1 in poultry.
10. 27 Jan 2004: Lao PDR reports H5N1 in poultry.
11. 2 Feb 2004: Indonesia reports H5N1 in poultry.
12. 4 Feb 2004: China reports H5N1 in poultry.
13. 20 Feb 2004: Anecdotal evidences suggests H5N1 infection in a single
household of domestic cats in Thailand.
14. 18 Mar 2004: Research (1) case studies of 10 patients in Viet Nam point
to close contact with infected poultry as the probable source of infection
in most cases, but conclude that, in 2 family clusters, limited
human-to-human transmission within the family cannot be ruled out.
15. Jun./Jul 2004: China, Indonesia, Thailand and Viet Nam report
recurrence of H5N1 in poultry.
16. 8 Jul 2004: Research (2) identifies the dominant Z genotype in poultry,
considers possible role of wild birds in spread, and concludes that H5N1
has found a new ecological niche in poultry, but is not yet fully adapted
to this host.
17. 13 Jul 2004: Research (3) shows that H5N1 has become progressively more
lethal for mammals and can kill wild waterfowl, long considered a
disease-free natural reservoir. Japan announces control of the H5N1 poultry
outbreak and is considered disease-free by OIE.
18. Jul 2004: Research (4).A case report is published indicating atypical
human H5N1 infection in Thailand (from Mar 04), with fever and diarrhoea
but no respiratory symptoms. The report suggests that the clinical spectrum
of disease may be broader than previously thought.
19. 7 Aug 2004: Malaysia reports H5N1 in poultry.
20. 20 Aug 2004: Research (5). Chinese researchers report preliminary
findings of H5N1 infection in pigs. No evidence suggests that pig
infections are widespread, and the finding appears to have limited
epidemiological significance.
21. 2 Sep 2004: Research (6) shows that domestic cats experimentally
infected with H5N1 develop severe disease and can spread infection to other
cats. Prior to this research, domestic cats were considered resistant to
disease from all influenza A viruses.
22. 21 Sep 2004: Republic of Korea announces control of the H5N1 poultry
outbreak and is considered disease-free by OIE.
23. 11 Oct 2004: Outbreak begins in zoo tigers in Thailand said to have
been fed chicken carcasses. Altogether, 147 tigers out of a population of
441 die or are euthanized.
24. 22 Oct 2004: Highly pathogenic H5N1 is confirmed in 2 eagles illegally
imported into Europe (Brussels) from Thailand.
25. 29 Oct 2004: Research (7) confirms that domestic ducks can act as
silent reservoirs,
excreting large quantities of highly pathogenic virus yet showing few if
any signs of illness.
26. December 2004: Poultry outbreaks ongoing in Indonesia, Thailand, and
Vietnam and possibly also in Cambodia and Lao PDR.
27. 3 Jan 2005: Malaysia (Peninsular) announces control of the H5N1 poultry
outbreak and is now considered disease-free by OIE.
28. 27 Jan 2005: Research (8) concludes that a girl in Thailand probably
passed the virus to at least her mother in September 2004, causing fatal
disease. This is the 1st published account of probable secondary human
transmission, resulting in severe disease, of any avian influenza virus.
29. 17 Feb 2005: Research (9) retrospectively identifies at least one fatal
atypical case in
Viet Nam (from February 2004), presenting with diarrhoea and encephalitis,
but normal chest X-rays.
30. 30 April 2005: Wild birds begin dying at Qinghai Lake in central China,
where hundreds of thousands of migratory birds congregate. Altogether, 6345
birds from different species die in the coming weeks.
31. 8 June 2005: China reports poultry outbreak in Xinjiang Autonomous Region.
32. 6 Jul 2005: Research (10) on viruses isolated from dead birds in
Qinghai Lake suggests the outbreak was caused by a new H5N1 variant that
may be more lethal to wild birds and experimentally infected mice.
33. 14 Jul 2005: Research (11) on viruses isolated from dead birds in
Qinghai Lake demonstrates transmission of the virus among migratory geese
and suggests that the virus may be carried along winter migratory routes.
34. 15 Jul 2005: Tests on 3 civets that died in late June in Viet Nam
detect H5N1, marking the 1st infection of this species with the virus. The
endangered Owston's palm civets were raised in captivity; source of
infection is unknown.
35. 23 Jul 2005: Russia reports outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian
influenza, subsequently confirmed as H5N1, in poultry in western Siberia.
The outbreak spreads to affect 6 administrative regions in Siberia. Dead
migratory birds are reported in the vicinity of outbreaks.
36. 2 Aug 2005: Kazakhstan reports an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian
influenza, subsequently confirmed as H5N1, in poultry in areas adjacent to
Siberia. Dead migratory birds are reported in the vicinity of outbreaks.
37. 10 Aug 2005: China reports outbreak in Tibet Autonomous Region.
38. 12 Aug 2005: Mongolia reports the death of 89 migratory birds at 2
lakes. H5N1 is subsequently identified in these birds.
39. 29 Sep 2005: Research (12) describes the clinical features of H5N1
infection in humans and reviews recommendations for the management of cases.
40. October 2005: Research (13) on the evolution of human and animal
viruses circulating in Asia in 2005 suggests that several amino acids
located near the receptor-binding site are undergoing change, some of which
may affect antigenicity or transmissibility.
41. 6 Oct 2005: Research (14, 15) describes reconstruction of the lethal
1918 pandemic virus, concludes that this virus was entirely avian, and
finds some similarities with H5N1.
42. 13 Oct 2005: Highly pathogenic H5N1 is confirmed in poultry in Turkey.
43. 15 Oct 2005: Highly pathogenic H5N1 is confirmed in poultry in Romania.
44. 20 Oct 05: Taiwan, China, reports the detection of highly pathogenic
H5N1 in a cargo of exotic songbirds smuggled from mainland China. Thailand
reports its 1st new case since 8 Oct 2004.
45. 23 Oct 2005: Highly pathogenic H5N1 is confirmed in an imported parrot,
held in quarantine in the UK, that died 3 days earlier.
46. 24 Oct 2005: China reports outbreak in Anhui Province. Thailand and
Indonesia report more cases.
47. 26 Oct 2005: China reports outbreak in Hunan, making this the 6th
province reporting outbreaks during 2005. Croatia confirms H5N1 in wild birds.
