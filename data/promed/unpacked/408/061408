Australian authorities seek information on unexplained neurologic
cases
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The State Government of Victoria's Department of Primary Industries
(DPI) wants veterinary practitioners to submit samples from horses
displaying unexplained clinical signs of nervous system disease.

Victoria's acting chief veterinary officer, Dr Andrew Cameron, said
DPI was investigating a number of cases of unexplained neurologic
disease in horses. "Samples from veterinary practitioners
investigating any cases of nervous system disease will help our
investigation," Cameron said.

In Victoria, cases have been observed along the Murray River and in
an area of about 50 km [31 mi] around Ballarat. Unexplained neurologic
cases have also been observed recently in South Australia and New
South Wales. The main clinical sign in horses is ataxia
(incoordination).

"The coincidence of these cases with a period of extraordinarily high
mosquito activity after a heavy rainy season, and the apparent
association with proximity to water bodies is highly suggestive of
arbovirus (insectborne) infection," Cameron said.

"Cases of neurological disease have been previously seen in horses
during periods of Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE, an Australian form
of encephalitis) activity, such as in 1974," Cameron explained. "While
recent evidence of Ross River virus infection (an Australian arbovirus
spread by mosquitoes that causes joint and nervous system disease in
horses, according to the Victoria Government Health Information
website) has been detected in some of the horses sampled to date, the
possibility of MVE or other arboviruses is also being investigated.

"The horse is usually a 'dead-end' host for mosquito-borne arbovirus
infections," he added. "There is no risk to humans from direct contact
with horses, and it is highly likely that the great majority of horses
infected with arbovirus will develop no clinical symptoms."

Horse owners are encouraged to consult with their veterinary
practitioner as to means of reducing horse exposure to mosquitoes.

"Stabling during the dawn and dusk periods of mosquito activity is a
valuable strategy, and topical treatments and repellents are
available," Cameron said.

"There is no association with bat populations, and the symptoms and
course of illness in affected horses are unlike Hendra virus
infection, which has also been ruled out by precautionary testing," he
concluded.

[Some of the videos showing the affected horses are quite dramatic
and sad for the animals and their owners. The videos are making their
way through many veterinary emails and websites and can be obtained
from the Biosecurity Australia website at

While indeed this may be Murray Valley encephalitis re-emerging, it
may well be Ross River virus. We look forward to an accurate
diagnosis. - Mod.TG
