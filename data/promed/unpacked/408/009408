[On 20 Jun 2014 Romania reported to the OIE its 1st BSE case, dating back to 6 May 2014 (archive no. 20140621.2556417). The causal agent of the case was reported as "Prion (atypical BSE L-type)"; the diagnosis was initially performed by Romania's Institute for Diagnostic and Animal Health (national laboratory), confirmed by the BSE reference laboratory at Weybridge (UK).

The current case seems to have been detected, within the routine BSE surveillance activities in slaughterhouses, in the brain of an apparently healthy cow. The causal agent in this case is reported as "Prion" and cohorts of the affected cow are reportedly being sought. This means that the case is regarded by the authorities a classical case of BSE in a locally born animal. Such a finding may bear significant epidemiological consequences.

According to Romania's GBR ("Geographic risk of BSE") report, as adopted in May 2001 by EU's Scientific Steering Committee (SSC), Romania's cattle "had to cope with a high (1980-1990); moderate (1991-1993), and (since 1994) again high external challenge of BSE challenge" (introduced, imported). There was also an internal "unstable BSE situation" (eg SRM-ban not applied until 1996).

The following quantities of imported MBM's (meat & bone meals) were given in the said GBR:

UK: 466 tons in 1995
Non UK: Around 10 600 tons in total:
1980-1985: 4500 tons from Germany, Italy, Ireland.
1986-1990: 3800 tons from Germany (1990).
1990-1993: 285 tons from Denmark, Belgium and Germany.
1994-1999: 1900 tons from Germany, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands and Denmark.

On top of MBM's, Romania imported, during the years 1980-1999, 22 300 live cattle from the following European BSE-countries: Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, France, Italy and Denmark.

The SSC was of the opinion that "BSE infectivity that most likely entered Romania in the 80s or the mid 90s at the latest, was probably recycled and amplified", and concluded that "it is likely, but not confirmed that one or several cattle that are (pre-clinically or clinically) infected with the BSE agent are currently (2001) present in the domestic herd of Romania (GBR-III)".

No cases of classic BSE have been reported from Romania prior to the current one. A confirmation of the diagnosis by the reference laboratory may be advisable. Epidemiological investigation into the possible source of infection (feed?) is anticipated. The age of the affected animal is requested. - Mod.AS
