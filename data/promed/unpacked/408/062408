Bird flu discovered in dead goose
---------------------------------
A dead goose has tested positive for the highly virulent H5N1 strain
of bird flu, government scientists have said.

The remains of the bird were discovered around 1km (0.6m) from
Abbotsbury Swannery in Dorset, where a number of swans have been
found with the disease. The Department for the Environment, Food and
Rural Affairs said the Canada goose [Picture at
<http://identify.whatbird.com/img/4/354/image.aspx>] was the 11th
wild bird in the area to test positive for H5N1. Restrictions on the
movement of poultry have now been introduced in the area. Defra said
the decision was based on veterinary advice. Poultry keepers will not
be able to move birds from their premises except under licence.

A spokeswoman said that the latest case of bird flu was "not
unexpected." She said H5N1 was active at a very low level among wild
birds in the area, and there was no evidence of the virus in domestic
poultry locally. Regular surveillance was continuing, she added, with
patrols looking for dead birds.

A Wild Bird Monitoring Area is in place around the affected area,
with keepers required to keep domestic poultry away from wild birds.
Owners have been urged to stay vigilant and report any signs of the
disease. Since 10 Jan 2008, H5N1 has been identified in 10 mute swans
in the area -- with the last case confirmed on 4 Feb 2008.

Abbotsbury Swannery, near Chesil Beach, is part of an area of wetland
recognised to be of international importance.

[An epidemiology report "HIGHLY PATHOGENIC AVIAN INFLUENZA H5N1 IN
WILD SWANS IN DORSET," prepared by the National Emergency
Epidemiology Group and published on 12 Feb 2008, included in its
Executive Summary -- among others -- the following statements:

- "Analysis of the virus indicates that it is related to
contemporary viruses from continental Europe and is most closely
related to a cluster of isolates recovered in mid to late 2007 from
wild and domestic birds in the Czech Republic, Romania and Poland.

- The source of infection for swans has not been identified, however
the most plausible hypothesis is that it was introduced by one of the
migratory wild birds that make up part of the population on the Fleet
during the winter."
