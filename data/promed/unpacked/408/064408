[The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/hanta/hps/index.htm> identifies
hantaviruses in the New World as follows. North America: Hantaviruses in
the New World are associated with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS).
Sigmodontine rodents carry the hantaviruses that cause HPS and are found
throughout the Americas. Sin Nombre virus, carried by _Peromyscus
maniculatus_, is the predominant cause of HPS in the United States and
Canada. Mononghela, New York, Bayou, and Black Creek Canal viruses also
cause HPS and are found in eastern Canada and the eastern and southeastern
US. In South and Central America, hantaviruses that have been identified as
causing HPS are Andes virus in Argentina and Chile; Andes-like viruses
including Oran, Lechiguanas, and Hu39694 in Argentina; Laguna Negra virus
in Bolivia and Paraguay; Bermejo virus in Argentina; Juquitiba virus in
Brazil; and Choclo virus in Panama. Numerous other hantaviruses have been
identified but have not been linked to human disease. - Mod.CP]

Washington State: Death of Farm worker Attributed to Hantavirus Infection
-----------------------------------------------
The death of a farm worker in Grant County last month [September 2005] has
been traced to hantavirus [infection], health officials said. The worker's
name and home town were not disclosed in a county Health Department
announcement on Thu [13 Oct 2005], but the agency's personal health
services director, Peggy Grigg, said the local authorities were providing
hantavirus prevention information to businesses and residents in the area
where the worker lived. Laboratory tests this month showed the worker died
of [hantavirus pulmonary syndrome], which is spread by exposure to the
dried feces and urine of rodents, mostly deer mice. The disease was
virtually unknown in the United States before an outbreak in 1993 in the
Four Corners area of Utah, Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona. Since then,
Washington state has had 27 reported cases, 9 of them fatal. One of the
last deaths from hantavirus [pulmonary syndrome] in the state was in Skagit
County in 2003. [This new fatal case presumably raises the number of cases
to 28 and the number of deaths to 10. - Mod.CP]
About 14 percent of the 1000 deer mice that have been tested for hantavirus
infection in Washington state since 1993 have been carriers, according to
Dr. John Grendon, public health veterinarian at the state Health
Department. "Although it is rare, hantavirus continues to be a threat,"
Grendon was quoted as saying in the county agency's statement. "It's
important for people, especially those living in or visiting rural areas
where deer mice are most common, to know how they can prevent this
potentially deadly disease."

Cumulative Number of Cases of Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome in the USA by
state of exposure, updated to 6 Jul 2005
-----------------------------------------------
Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a deadly disease transmitted by
infected rodents through urine, droppings, or saliva. Humans can contract
the disease when they breathe in aerosolized virus. HPS was 1st recognized
in 1993 and has since been identified throughout the United States.
Although rare, HPS is potentially deadly. Rodent control in and around the
home remains the primary strategy for preventing hantavirus infection.
4 hantaviruses are known to cause HPS in the United States: Sin Nombre
virus, Bayou virus, New York virus, and Black Creek Canal virus. Sin Nombre
virus has been the etiologic agent in all cases with the exception of 3
cases in Texas and one in Louisiana due to Bayou virus; one case in New
York and one in Rhode Island due to New York virus, and one case in Florida
due to Black Creek Canal virus.
