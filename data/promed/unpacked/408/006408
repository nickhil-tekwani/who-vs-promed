The foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] among cattle in the State [Karnataka] is proving to be a headache for scientists of the central team as well as specialist veterinarians.

It is suspected that the cattle may have been afflicted with the anthrax disease, spread by _Bacillus anthracis_ bacterium, and hence, it is becoming difficult to control its spread.

After a visit to the disease-affected districts, the experts held discussions in this regard with medical officers of the department of animal husbandry and veterinary science.

Autopsies of the bodies of the dead animals as well as testing of the soil in the cattle sheds is being conducted to ascertain the disease that the cattle are suffering from. Soil samples have been taken to the Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) at Mukteshwar in Uttarakhand.

Dr B Patnaik, project director of FMD at IVRI, and specialist veterinarian from the State Dr Ananth have visited several parts of the State, and the rising deaths have only surprised them, prompting them to opt for soil test, an official of the State department of animal husbandry and veterinary science, told Deccan Herald.

Usually, casualties are rare in case of the FMD, says Ananth.

The fact that cattle are recovering after they are given injection, but dying 7 days later has foxed experts. They are not able to identify whether fodder is the cause or the soil.

Officials said FMD was difficult to control and it takes 3 months for the disease to subside. Another cause for concern is that most of the casualties are calves.

The soil samples are subjected to a number of tests. Grass is then grown on the soil and it is fed to the cattle. Any change in the health condition of the cattle is monitored.

Results of all the tests will help in ascertaining the cause of the disease and whether it is FMD or anthrax.

[The suspected "anthrax" is very much in doubt. Karnataka State has been, reportedly, extensively infected by FMD for some time, with reported considerable mortality. Recently, an (unconfirmed) report mentioned FMD serotype O as the causative agent. FMD virus may cause high mortality (up to 50 percent and beyond) in young ruminants, mainly due to cardiac degeneration and necrosis; the lesions are sometimes called "tiger heart" lesions.

Such phenomena are not as common in older animals, but some FMD virus strains, particularly of serotype O, have been shown in the past to be highly pathogenic even in adult animals. In any event, it is advisable to fully investigate FMD, particularly lab tests, before referring to other, less likely diagnoses. - Mods.MHJ/AS
