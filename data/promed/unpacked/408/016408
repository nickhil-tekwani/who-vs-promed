The Vice-Premier and Minister of Farming and Agriculture of
Nagorno-Karabakh, Armo Catryan, announced that new cases of African
swine fever [ASF] have been registered in the Hadrut region of
Karabakh.

47 million AMD [Armenian Drams; USD 151 000] have been allocated from
the state budget for compensation to the owners of infected swine.
Infected animals have been culled earlier this year [2008] by
bloodless methods [By injection?! Clarification will be helpful. -
Mod.AS]. The Minister said that an accurate analysis of the
outbreak's dimensions is difficult to perform, since animal owners
present inflated losses. This also makes the process of compensation
more complicated.

Generally, 8500 swine are believed to have died of ASF, which means
about a quarter of the local pig population. This is equal to the
loss of 350 tons of pork, valued at 200 million AMD [USD 642 226].

"We will not try to regenerate the previous population of swine
unless we are sure that ASF is gone," the Minister said. The epidemic
caused huge losses for local economies of the republic, particularly
for the regions of Martakert and Askeran.

The epidemic of ASF caused major losses in Georgia at the end of the
last year [2007] [For timetable, see commentary. - Mod.AS]. Then, it
spread to Armenia, killing large numbers of swine. ASF was registered
in the village of Nij-Gabalinski in Azerbaijan on 28 Jan 2008, where
the entire pig population was culled, and quarantine was imposed
[Azerbaijan officially reported to the OIE on this outbreak on 29 Jan
2008, indicating that out of 4832 susceptible pigs, 98 died, and 4734
were destroyed. - Mod.AS].

[The 1st information about the outbreak in Karabakh came in November
2007. Later, it acquired considerable size and caused huge losses to
the local economy. The epidemic process slowed in January 2008, and
the veterinary control activities were decreased. Possibly,
inadequate veterinary control favored the emergence of new outbreaks
this spring 2008. AFS was registered in Georgia, Abkhazia, Armenia,
South Osetia and Azerbaijan. Single cases of ASF have been registered
in wild boar in Russia, in Chechnya territories. - Mod.NP]

[Nagorno-Karabakh (map at
<http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Location_Nagorno-Karabakh2.png>)
is a de facto independent republic, officially part of the Republic
of Azerbaijan. Its population is predominantly Christian, pigs being
a significant part of agriculture, which is similar to its neighbor
Armenia, but different from predominantly Moslem Azerbaijan and
Iran.

ASF seems to have got its initial foothold in the (politically
unstable) Caucasus region in April 2007 (or earlier?), most probably
by the introduction of contaminated waste from ships in the port of
Poti, Abkhazia. From Abkhazia -- an autonomous republic of northwest
Georgia bordering Russia and the Black Sea -- the disease has been
spreading since then throughout the region. In areas where pigs are
reared, ASF is seriously affecting commercial farms of domestic pigs.
In Moslem areas, it is mainly spreading throughout the wild boar
populations. The 1st official ASF notification to the OIE from the
region was made by Georgia in June 2007.

Based upon the results of genotyping, performed by the ASFV OIE
Reference Laboratory at the Institute for Animal Health Pirbright
Laboratory, UK, it was concluded that the source of infection was
from the eastern side of southern Africa rather than west or central
Africa or Sardinia. The current world distribution of ASF can be seen
in OIE's map at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?selected_start_day=1&selected_start_month=1&selected_start_year=2007&selected_end_day=31&selected_end_month=12&selected_end_year=2008&page=disease_outbreak_map&date_submit=OK>).
To view the situation in the Caucasus, zoom in; according to this
map's data, the outbreak is continuing in Abkhazia and Dagestan,
while it is resolved in Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. However, the
complete eradication of ASF in the affected countries has been
(unofficially) questioned; its current reporting from
Nagorno-Karabakh may be indicative of its continued activity -- and
spread -- within the entire region.

Obviously, similar scenarios could prevail anywhere globally if waste
from ships arriving from ASF-infected regions is indiscriminately
unloaded while veterinary controls are deficient or non-existent;
this, combined with unstable political situations, can lead to a
disastrous outcome. - Mod.AS]
