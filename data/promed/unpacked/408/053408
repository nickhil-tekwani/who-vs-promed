[The update of the OIE disease list above, suggested by a Working
Group and endorsed by the Code Commission, was adopted without
modifications in Resolution No XXX of the International Committee
(composed of the representatives of the 172 Member Countries) during
its 76th General Session last week (Paris, 25-30 May 2008]. The
resolution said, "The Committee resolves to adopt the updates to the
Terrestrial Code proposed in Annex ... XXIX of Document 76 SG/12/CS1
B in English, French, and Spanish, each text being authentic".

Two of the changes above are technical: the translocation of eastern
equine encephalomyelitis and Surra from the category of "equine
diseases" to the category of "multiple species".

The 3rd change, namely the addition of a new disease entity, epizootic
haemorrhagic disease (EHD), to OIE's disease list, is of considerable
significance. The disease, caused by an orbivirus and known to be
transmitted by culicoids, has been added since it complies with the
definition of an emerging disease, since multiple outbreaks, affecting
cattle, have been notified by 4 Mediterranean member countries
(Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Israel; see references) during the 2nd
half of 2006 as "disease never reported before". According to the data
of the Institute of Animal Health at Pirbright, the disease in the
Maghreb countries [Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia] was caused by EHDV-9,
while the Israeli outbreak was caused by EHDV-7. Information from
other countries in the region has been requested in ProMED-mail
posting 20080522.1693.

When the Member countries submit their next, prescribed semi-annual
reports to the OIE, covering the period January-June 2008, they will
have to include EHD and indicate if the disease or the virus are
present within their respective territories. - Mod.AS
