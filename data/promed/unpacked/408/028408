Re: Welcome Saudi Arabia!
You forgot about me, I am from Jordan, currently I am studying in Purdue
University, West Lafayette, Indiana [USA]. I am doing my PhD in infectious
diseases, I will be a professor in the Veterinary School in Jordan
University of Science and Technology (JUST) as soon as I finish. I feel
that I am in touch with the world whenever I read my email.
