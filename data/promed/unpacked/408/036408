I have to disagree with Dr. Schmidt. [The latter had stated "In fact, the
most common differential in the U.S. for vesicular-type lesions in horses
are plant awns acquired from forage such as fescue." MHJ
As a veterinarian and a toxicologist, fescue (_Fescuta_ spp.) does NOT have
awns and cannot and has not been known to cause oral ulcers/vesicules.
However, the multitude of foxtails (_Seretia_ spp.) do have awns and may
cause some mechanical damage.

question which is the probable cause of this equine condition in New
