Ukraine: 3 members of same family in Vinnitsa contract rabies
-----------------------------------------------
According to the Veterinary Department of Vinnitsa Oblast, 3 people have
contracted laboratory confirmed rabies. Last week [2nd week April 2005], an
entire family in the village of Lukashovka in the Litinsk Region was
hospitalized on the suspicion of rabies infection. According to the Public
Relations Department of the Emergency Situations Ministry in Vinnitsa, a
dog had bitten the 29-year-old father, 28-year-old mother and their
9-year-old child.
A fox had bitten their dog at the beginning of March 2005, but the owners
did not take this event seriously. On 10 Apr 2005, the dog bit the son
while he was feeding her. Later, the parents also suffered bites. On 15 Apr
2005, the dog died, and tests confirmed that it was rabid. The same day,
the family was admitted to the Vinnitsa Hospital, because there was no
anti-rabies vaccine in their local hospital.
At the present time, all [susceptible] animals in the village are being
vaccinated, and the population is being made aware of the rabies risk.
Alexey Golovizkiy, the chief of the Medical Supply Department of the
Emergency Situations Ministry is warning the population about the main
symptoms of rabies: numbness of extremities, cramps, irritability, vision
and auditory impairments. In the absence of prompt vaccination, victims can
develop serious impairment of nervous system functions and eventually die.

[Already this year (2005), rabies virus infection has been observed in wild
carnivores (foxes and wolves) and domestic animals in the Ukraine, and a
human case of rabies was reported following a fox bite. Post-exposure
vaccination was necessary also in children and adults following contact
with a rabid fox. Vaccination of domestic animals and enhanced risk
awareness in the rural population of the Ukraine are urgent priorities to
prevent further such incidents. - Mod.CP]
