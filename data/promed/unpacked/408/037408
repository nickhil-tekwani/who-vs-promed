_Borrelia miyamotoi_ is the latest tick-borne disease to hit Cape Cod. As an emergency room nurse, [this nurse] has grown used to seeing patients with symptoms of Lyme disease and a few other tick-borne illnesses. But it wasn't until [he] was hospitalized this month [August 2017] for 4 days that [he], 37 years old, became acquainted with a tick-borne sickness only recently known to infect humans.

_Borrelia miyamotoi_ was 1st associated with fever in a 2011 report from Russia; a 2013 article by Yale researchers identified the 1st infections in Americans, including at least one person from Nantucket. Caused by a spiral-shaped bacterium distantly related to the pathogen that causes Lyme disease, miyamotoi disease, like Lyme, is treated with doxycycline. [The nurse] says the antibiotic saved his life, or at least his health.

[Since _Borrelia miyamotoi_ is transmitted by the same hard-bodied _Ixodes_ tick species that transmits the organisms that cause Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, babesiosis, and Powassan virus encephalitis, it is possible that co-infections with one or more of these tick-borne pathogens may occur.
