"Bluetongue is out of control, so much so that we are witnessing an exponential growth of the disease, which yesterday [7 Oct 2021] recorded 684 000 animals involved with 1913 outbreaks and 9388 deaths, in continuous and rapid growth". This was underlined by the president of Copagri Sardegna, Ignazio Cirronis, in whose opinion "the responsibilities of the Department of Health, which decided to derogate from the obligations established by its own decree of 25 Feb 2016 relating to the vaccine prophylaxis plan, are serious. it is deemed not to be fully applied within the established time frames."

"We consider it very serious" -- continues Cirronis -- "that a dangerous state of malfunctioning of the chain of command in the field of animal health remains; to date, in fact, no decision has been taken to purchase the necessary vaccines, already quantified, and there is no coordination between the departments of Agriculture and Health, which should proceed by mutual agreement and involve agricultural organizations together".

[The spread of BTV-4 in Sardinia is alarming indeed. According to the most recent update of ICZ (Experimental Zooprophylactic Institute of Sardinia), the number of new, active outbreaks have risen from 1431 (28 Sep 2021) to 1948 (8 Oct 2021). During the same time span, the number of dead sheep has risen from 5041 to 10 033. On top of the active foci, there were, on 8 Oct 2021, 63 suspected outbreaks, yet to be confirmed; 61 outbreaks have been declared as resolved since the start of the epizootic.

The total number of (susceptible) sheep on the premises of affected holdings, is 698 039, of which, since the start of the event, in early Aug 2021, 64 435 presented clinical signs and 10 033 died. ICZ's data are available at https://www.izs-sardegna.it/oev/SCHEMA_SARDEGNA.pdf (these data are updated daily).

Details of the vaccinations have not become available. This is a critical component of the control effort.

It will be interesting to note if the BTV-4 identified in Sardinia is genetically related/similar to the strain recently reported from the Balearic Islands, a Spanish territory in the Western Mediterranean. In Jul 2020, BTV serotype 4 was reported by Algeria to the OIE as the cause of disease in sheep. This strain is long known as being highly pathogenic in sheep.

The indigenous Sarda dairy sheep breed is known to be extremely susceptible to the BT virus. Sheep breeding is a main source of income in Sardinia. Vaccination is the only practical way to diminish losses.

The EC has introduced severe preventive measures in relation to the movement of cattle from BT-affected regions, since cattle, readily infected (mostly subclinically), are regarded as potential spreaders of the virus. These measures affect trade, with economic consequences.

BT virus, a culicoides-borne orbivirus, has broadened its distribution significantly since 2006, when detected for the first time beyond the southern Europe/Mediterranean basin, affecting cattle, on top of the traditional victim -- sheep, in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany and France. The causative serotype, BTV-8, spread later to other European countries, appearing during the vector's activity season (mainly, Jul-Nov). Cattle breeders throughout Europe deserve to currently exercise alertness to the seasonal occurrence of bluetongue, particularly in unvaccinated cattle.
