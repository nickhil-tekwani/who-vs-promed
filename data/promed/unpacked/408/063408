The number of confirmed and suspected viral meningitis cases [that has] affected University of Maryland students has grown to 31, with 19 requiring hospitalization for their illness. This is up from 19 cases about 2 weeks ago.

Two School of Public Health professors offered some advice concerning prevention and symptoms to look for: "[M]y emphasis would be to be alert about the symptoms, and to not hesitate to go to your primary care physician immediately with concerns," said Dr Muhiuddin Haider, a research associate professor in the Maryland Institute of Applied Environmental Health. He also noted that the meningitis vaccine is only available for bacterial meningitis, not the viral kind that is affecting the campus. [There are vaccines available to prevent some types of viral meningitis, such as mumps. - Mod.ML]

While symptoms of viral meningitis often mimic the flu, Dr Gretchen De Silva, lecturer in the Public Health Science program at College Park, said that more severe cases may [have] sensitivity to light, stiffness of neck, and nausea. She said that washing hands, not sharing items, and boosting one's immune through sufficient sleep helps prevent catching meningitis.

The debilitating, but rarely fatal viral meningitis (also known as aseptic meningitis) is a very common type of meningitis affecting newborns, children, and adults alike. The symptoms of viral meningitis typically last a week or so; however, in some patients they can last for months. Symptoms include headache, fever, irritability, stiff neck, nausea, and sensitivity to light.

The Meningitis Foundation of America says viral meningitis is spread through the exchange of respiratory and throat secretions (kissing, coughing, sneezing, and sharing a cup, utensil, lip gloss, or cigarette). [Some of the organisms that cause] viral meningitis are also found in one's stool, which is how infants and neonates who aren't toilet trained and adults changing diapers develop it.

There is no specific treatment for viral meningitis at this time. Treating the symptoms of viral meningitis include getting plenty of rest, relaxation, fluids, and medicine to relieve a fever or headache.

[The term "meningitis" means an inflammation of the meninges, which are the tissues that surround the brain and spinal cord. The term implies lack of parenchymal brain and spinal cord involvement (otherwise called encephalitis and myelitis, respectively). Normally, there are 0 to 5 white cells (all mononuclear cells) per cmm [per cubic millimeter] in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF becomes cloudy when there are more than 500 white cells per cmm. When the CSF is visibly clear, but on laboratory examination the CSF white cell count is 6 to 500 cells per cmm, usually with lymphocytes predominating, the term aseptic meningitis is used.

The most common cause of aseptic meningitis is a viral infection and enteroviruses are the most common causes of viral meningitis, especially in children during the summer and early fall months. A prior ProMED-mail post (Human enterovirus D68 - North America (16): meningitis-associated? 20141031.2919892) reported that viral meningitis in 5 of the more than 20 cases at that time in University of Maryland students was confirmed as having been caused by an enterovirus, although the specific type was not specified.

Enteroviruses are most often spread via the fecal-oral route from person to person through fecal contamination of water or food or contact with contaminated inanimate objects. Enteroviruses can also be spread through respiratory secretions (saliva, sputum, or nasal mucus) of an infected person. - Mod.ML
