Just thought I'd drop a line from Addis Ababa, where I have spent the
past several days visiting animal welfare projects by day and
canvassing the city dog and cat population by night, hiking up and
down shantytown alleys where it is allegedly too dangerous to go.

Much of what I'm seeing is no surprise -- it's the developing world
everywhere -- but I was surprised yesterday [3 Sep 2010] at the
volume and ubiquitousness of anthrax among the workloads of the
Brooke Hospital for Animals and the Donkey Sanctuary, each of which
operates several programs in different parts of the country.

Right here in Addis Ababa, anthrax is almost as commonly seen as the
routine injuries to donkeys from traffic, overloading, and beating.
The Donkey Sanctuary vets showed me slides of all of their most
interesting cases from the past 2 years, including anthrax, tetanus,
hyena bites (astonishingly common), and anthrax, anthrax, and more anthrax.

The Brooke is really pushing vaccination at their outposts in the
boonies. The Donkey Sanctuary in Addis Ababa is mainly treating
donkeys who come in from the boonies, but is pushing vaccination at
their outlying clinics. As yet, though, the volume of cases suggests
that a negligible percentage of the donkey population has been vaccinated.

Probably the cattle, goats, and sheep are all a lot more vulnerable
than the donkeys. Overall, Ethiopia appears to have a hell of a
problem, though I was told that as bad as it is now, it used to be worse.

I can't statistically quantify anthrax in Ethiopia now vs. any point
in the past, but I can testify firsthand to the present level of
concern among the Brooke Hospital and Donkey Sanctuary veterinarians.
The Brooke head vet in Ethiopia has been in her position for about 2
years, and the Donkey Sanctuary clinic I visited has been operating
for about 2 years.

[Anthrax is hyper-enzootic in Ethiopia. During just 2006 through
2008, there were 2254, 775, and 430 outbreaks involving all livestock
species. In 2008 alone, this involved 3879 cattle, 3 camels, 8253
sheep and goats, and 723 horses, and an unstated number of human
cases. Vaccination numbers are uncertain. It is a ghastly situation.
If any of our Ethiopian members or others with relevant experience in
that country would care to comment, it would be welcomed.
