report & has only just come to our attention - Mod.JW]

Mohamed Dayow, one of the prominent elders of Tieglow of
Bakol region, told journalists on the VHF radio here in Mogadishu
that an unknown disease similar to measles and flu killed many
people in less than a week since its breakout. The local authorities
said that there is no diagnosis so far to cure this disease, which
has spread to more than 16 villages around Tieglow and is killing
four to five people everyday in the Horn of Africa country.
Mohamed Hajji Mohamed, the only medical worker in Dinsor district,
said water shortage is forcing the nomads and their livestock to move
to nearby towns and villages, which further aggravated the spread of
the disease.
Local elders said more than 40 people are infected with the unknown
disease everyday in five villages surrounding Dinsor district, including
the populous Korombod and Raholeh.
Cholera and malnutrition are killing dozens of people in southern
Somalia every week. Dayow said more than 90 people have died
of such diseases in his town in the past three weeks.

aggravated sanitary situation. If anyone has seen any followup
to this report of an unknown disease, we would very much
like to receive it - Mod.JW]
