MAF says 25 pig farms may have serious disease
---------------------------------------------------
Biosecurity officials say 25 piggeries between Whangarei and Taranaki
have been confirmed or provisionally confirmed as having a serious
pig disease.
More than half of the farms with post-weaning multisystemic wasting
syndrome (PMWS) -- which kills young pigs -- are in the wider
Waikato, where 20 percent of the country's pig farms are based.
Hundreds more farms around the country are being investigated.
The disease was diagnosed at Ted and Irene Graham's piggery at Orini,
24 km east of Huntly, in September 2003.
Their farm was one of 3 initially offered compensation deals by the
Pork Industry Board, but the offer was withdrawn when the scale of
the problem was realised.
The board is now drawing up a national pest management strategy,
although its chief executive, Angus Davidson, said the Ministry of
Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) had advised it to do nothing.
"Their initial suggestions were to investigate and do nothing. They
were adamant eradication wasn't a possibility, but, as we have said
all along, we disagree," he said.
MAF said this week in its latest biosecurity newsletter that it did
not consider that eradicating the disease was technically feasible.
"MAF's view is that with the current state of knowledge, and existing
test technologies, eradication is not technically feasible".
This was because the 2 main hypotheses were that it might be caused
by a porcine circovirus type 2, (PCV2) which was widespread in New
Zealand pigs, or it might be caused by an unidentified infectious
agent, or a virulent strain of PCV2 recently introduced to New
Zealand.
The Pork Industry board has backed an alternative view: that an
unidentified infectious agent was fed to pigs in uncooked pork, after
MAF allowed controls on waste-feeding to lapse, and before new
controls were introduced on cooking imported meat.
The industry board's strategy -- which will be finalised at producer
meetings around the country in the next 2 weeks -- will mean that
affected farmers like the Grahams will have to cull all their
animals, disinfect their farm and start from scratch.
Pig farmers will decide whether the board should pay compensation
through levies. If not, according to Mr Davidson, "the affected
farmers will be left to their own devices".
The pig disease attacks young pigs causing emaciation, diarrhoea and
breathing problems. It can kill up to 40 percent of a piggery's
weaners in its early stages.
It was first diagnosed in Canadian farms in 1991 and had progressed
to the UK and Europe by 1996. It has no human or food safety issues,
and grown pigs can continue to be sent to the works for processing.
MAF is maintaining restrictions on movement of pigs and pig products
from affected farms in Auckland, Waikato and Taranaki, and over
movement of pigs and pig semen to the South Island.
It is also surveying South Island piggeries to check for the disease
and is planning a survey of more North Island piggeries.
