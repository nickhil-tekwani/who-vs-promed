Fears that the deadly Asian bird flu may have spread to Europe were heightened
yesterday when the Romanian government confirmed that 3 ducks have died of a
strain of the disease in the east of the country. Scientists in Britain are to
conduct tests on samples to find out whether the domestic ducks were infected
by the dangerous H5N1 strain, which has so far been confined to Asia.
The Romanian government warned that it feared that the ducks were infected
with the strain, and strong security measures were put in place in the village
of Ceamurlia, in eastern Romania, where the birds died [in late September
2005]. Restrictions were placed on the movement of people and animals into and
out of the village near the Black Sea, and there were plans to vaccinate
people. Nearly all the domestic fowl in the village have been slaughtered.
Gabriel Pedoi, a senior Romanian health official, told the Associated
Press: "We are in the phase of suspicion. We are trying to isolate the virus
and we are taking all measures to isolate the disease."
If it is confirmed that the ducks died of the H5N1 strain of bird flu, Europe
will be placed on high alert. The strain has killed 60 people in Asia and
there are fears that the virus could soon develop into a form that passes more
easily to humans. In the worst-case scenario, that could trigger a human flu
pandemic.
European Union officials were last night counselling caution after a scare in
August 2005, when the virus spread to the Asian part of Russia. Sources said
Romania had not yet notified the European commission and they pointed out that
a seagull died of a mild version of bird flu in Finland recently.
But the World Health Organisation said it was taking the development
seriously, though it would only become fully involved in the outbreak if it
were transmitted to humans.
"If it were to spread to other geographical areas then we would be concerned
because H5N1 is quite strong and it can persist," said spokeswoman Maria Cheng.
The [UK] Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the
current assessment of the risk of the strain spreading from Russia to Britain
was low, but that any new, confirmed cases in countries that had not
experienced them before would trigger a further risk assessment. Asked if the
Romania cases could have resulted from migrating birds landing -- the most
obvious way the disease would spread -- a spokesman said: "It is too early to
say, if it is indeed confirmed, how the disease has been transmitted."
The dead birds were first noted in Ceamurlia [in late September 2005],
Romanian officials told AP. Samples were sent to a laboratory in Bucharest,
where scientists found antibodies to bird flu. Unable to find out the exact
strain of the virus, the scientists sent samples to Britain for testing at the
Veterinary Laboratories Agency, based in Weybridge, Surrey. The results are
expected in the next few days.
The findings in Romania follow warnings from the British Veterinary
Association (BVA) that some strain of avian flu is bound to arrive in Britain.
The best-case scenario has always been that infected birds would swiftly die
from the virus before they could get far. Each step towards the UK will raise
concern, however, that this scenario is too optimistic.
Different species of birds are affected differently by the virus, and some
will survive longer than others. The BVA pointed out that highly pathogenic
strains of avian flu have been spread by wild birds.
If avian flu gets into the domestic poultry flock, the risk of it passing to
humans clearly rises sharply. So far, the strain of avian flu that has spread
to humans in Asia has not shown an ability to transfer easily from one human
being to another. When that happens, experts believe we will have to deal with
a pandemic.

The Danube Delta is characterised by the plentiful population in an expanse of
wetlands and a flyway for migrating birds. Such birds were suspected as
vectors of West Nile virus into the region during the 1990's. See: Costin
