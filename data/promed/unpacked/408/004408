Update: Fusarium keratitis -- United States, 2005-6
---------------------------------------------------
In April 2006, CDC reported on an ongoing multistate investigation of
Fusarium keratitis occurring predominantly among contact lens wearers (1).
This update summarizes epidemiologic developments in this investigation,
which indicate an association with Bausch & Lomb's ReNu with MoistureLoc�
contact lens solution.
Fusarium keratitis is a fungal infection of the cornea, preceded usually by
trauma to the eye. Although not a notifiable disease, the infection is
thought to be rare among contact lens wearers in temperate climates (2).
Fusarium keratitis is treated with antifungal medication but can be severe
and sometimes result in vision loss and the need for corneal
transplantation (3).
As of [18 May 2006], CDC had received reports of 130 confirmed cases of
Fusarium keratitis infection, defined as clinically consistent fungal
keratitis with symptom onset after [1 Jun 2005], no history of recent
ocular trauma, and a corneal culture yielding a Fusarium species.
Cases have been reported from 26 states and one territory.* Patients had a
median age of 41 years (range: 12-83 years), and 85 of 127 (67 per cent)
were female. As a result of this infection, corneal transplantation was
required in 37 of 120 (31 per cent) cases.
Among the 130 patients with confirmed cases, 125 reported wearing contact
lenses, and 118 were able to identify which contact lens solution(s) they
had used during the month before onset of infection. Seventy-five (64 per
cent) reported using Bausch & Lomb's ReNu with MoistureLoc alone, 14 (12
per cent) reported using MoistureLoc in combination with another product, 8
(7 per cent) reported using an unspecified Bausch & Lomb solution, and 21
(18 per cent) reported using only products other than MoistureLoc, from
various manufacturers. Ongoing surveillance continues to identify persons
who used MoistureLoc and had disease onset after [13 Apr 2006], when Bausch
& Lomb withdrew this product from the market in the United States.
In April [2006], a subset of confirmed case-patients who were soft contact
lens wearers and aged greater than 18 years was enrolled in a matched
case-control investigation to evaluate risk factors for infection. To avoid
potential bias from media coverage on case-patient responses, this subset
was limited to those patients reported to CDC before online publication of
the initial MMWR Dispatch on [10 Apr 2006]. Neighborhood-matched controls
were adults reporting soft contact lens use during March 2006 with no
history of fungal keratitis.
Information regarding contact lens types, solutions used, and contact lens
hygiene practices was obtained via telephone interviews conducted by
trained personnel who used standardized questionnaires. Exact conditional
logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios.
A total of 50 case-patients and 79 controls were enrolled in the matched
case-control investigation. For the most stringent test of product
association, analysis was limited to the matched sets of 25 case-patients
and 37 controls who were soft contact lens wearers, reported using only a
single solution type, and provided all the information requested. In a
multivariable model, use of Bausch & Lomb's ReNu with MoistureLoc during
the month before symptom onset was independently associated with being a
case-patient (adjusted odds ratio: 19.0, 95 per cent confidence interval =
2.4--944.9, p less than 0.001), when compared with contact lens solutions
other than ReNu with MoistureLoc or ReNu Multiplus�; 19 case-patients and 7
controls reported this exposure. This association was statistically
significant even after controlling for poor contact lens care (i.e.,
reported reuse or topping off of contact lens solution). Use of ReNu
Multiplus solution was not significantly associated with infection
(adjusted odds ratio: 3.6, 95 per cent confidence interval = 0.3--189.0, p
= 0.5); 5 case-patients and 10 controls reported this exposure.
The results of this case-control investigation indicate an increased risk
for Fusarium keratitis associated with use of Bausch & Lomb's ReNu with
MoistureLoc. The cause of this association is not clear; however, further
studies, including environmental and molecular testing, are ongoing.
Although certain patients have reported use of other contact lens
solutions, the analysis does not indicate that these products are
associated with significantly increased risk for disease. Patients who
reported using only products other than MoistureLoc might not have recalled
all the contact lens solutions they had used, especially if the period
between exposure and interview was lengthy. In addition, extensive
surveillance for this infection might have identified patients whose
disease was unrelated to the outbreak.
Given the association between Fusarium keratitis and MoistureLoc, Bausch &
Lomb (Rochester, New York) announced its decision to voluntarily recall and
permanently remove this contact lens solution from the worldwide market on
15 May 2006]. Contact lens wearers should immediately discontinue use of
this solution and consult an eye-care professional regarding use of an
appropriate alternative product for cleaning or disinfecting lenses.
Contact lens wearers also should practice good hygiene, including hand
washing and drying before handling lenses, avoiding reuse of contact lens
solutions, and following the specific instructions of manufacturers of
contact lenses and contact lens solutions. Clinicians evaluating contact
lens wearers with signs or symptoms of keratitis (such as unusual redness
of the eyes, eye pain, tearing, discharge, or light sensitivity) should
consider fungal keratitis and refer the patient to an ophthalmologist if
appropriate. Eye-care professionals should continue to be vigilant in the
diagnosis and treatment of Fusarium keratitis, and should report possible
cases to state health departments or to CDC at telephone, 800-893-0485.
Reports should also be submitted to the FDA via MedWatch at telephone,
800-FDA-1088; fax, 800-FDA-0178; or mail, MedWatch, Food and Drug
Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857-9787; or online at

Fusarium (Fungal) Keratitis 15 May 2006
Breaking News: ReNu with MoistureLoc recalled & identified as likely cause
of increased infection risk
-------------------
What you need to know
Bausch & Lomb and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) both stated
today that the formula of ReNu with MoistureLoc, combined with how it is
used, can increase the risk of Fusarium infection.
Bausch & Lomb announced a permanent global recall of the product, a
decision the FDA says it supports. Bausch & Lomb's other ReNu products,
including MultiPlus and Multi-Purpose, are not included in the recall. To
date, data available do not indicate a problem with these products or
generic brands of this contact lens cleaning solution. Both MultiPlus and
Multi-Purpose are also different in formulation from MoistureLoc.
In a letter to the Academy, Bausch & Lomb specifically mentions alexidine,
a disinfecting agent added to MoistureLoc. MultiPlus and Multi-Purpose do
not include alexidine.
The letter states that alexidine is safe and effective, but under certain
extreme conditions -- such as [when] the solution is allowed to evaporate,
the solution is not regularly replaced in the lens case, when the bottle is
kept open in between uses or when the case is not cleaned properly or
changed regularly -- "the concentration of polymers included in the formula
to enhance comfort may make the solution more likely to be contaminated
with Fusarium in the environment."
Given that how people used MoistureLoc is apparently a factor in the
infections, consider reminding your contact lens patients about the
importance of following safe cleaning and handling practices.
According to news reports, the FDA will soon issue a report about
manufacturing violations at Bausch & Lomb's Greenville, SC, plant, where
MoistureLoc has been produced. But these violations, uncovered in a plant
inspection sparked by the fungal keratitis outbreak, are reportedly not
linked to the infections.
Based on the latest developments, the Academy's scheduled May 18
teleconference on fungal keratitis has been canceled.
Latest case numbers
From the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as of [12
May 2006]:
- 122 reported confirmed cases of Fusarium keratitis
- 15 "possible" cases and 60 still under investigation
- Confirmed cases or cases under investigation reported in 33 states or
territories (see list below).
What products were used in Fusarium keratitis cases (from the CDC, as of 9
May 2006):
- Complete data are available on 98 confirmed. Of those 98, 93 (95 per
cent) were listed as a contact lens user.
The products reported used in those 93:
- 59 (66 per cent) - Bausch & Lomb ReNu with MoistureLoc
- 19 (21 per cent) - Bausch & Lomb ReNu MultiPlus
- 9 (10 per cent) - Bausch & Lomb ReNu (unspecified)
- 3 (3 per cent) - any Advanced Medical Optics (AMO) product
- 4 (4 per cent) - any Alcon product
Note: The numbers add up to more than 93 because some people may have used
more than one product.
A spike in fungal infections last fall in Asia prompted Bausch & Lomb to
suspend sales of ReNu products in February 2006 in Singapore and Hong Kong.
The onset of Fusarium infections in the United States appears to stretch
back to June 2005, according to the CDC. On [10 Apr 2006], the CDC first
released information about 30 confirmed cases.

[The above official recall is not surprising, given the data supporting the
association of the product with an increased risk of fusarium keratitis.
The American College of Ophthalmology website release mentions they are
looking into the possibility of an association with alexidine. Bausch and
Lomb are not the only producers of a newer generation of contact lens
solution that offers increased moisture retention.
It is curious that the association seems limited to one product, and might
very well be a function of the specific chemical used.
Alexidine is an antiseptic in the biguanide family that has bactericidal
properties (see McDonnell G, Russell AD Antiseptics and Disinfectants:
Activity, Action, and Resistance. Clin Microbiol Rev 1999; 12(1): 147-79
(<http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=88911&blobtype=pdf>).
