An article just available reports that virologists at the Hamburg Institute
of Tropical Medicine could not determine the cause of death of the Ghanaian
suspected of having Lassa fever. This was announced by the health authority
in Mainz, Germany after tests ruled out Lassa as a cause.
[If anyone has information regarding a diagnosis for the illness of this
person please send it to ProMED-mail, otherwise, this string is now cut. --
