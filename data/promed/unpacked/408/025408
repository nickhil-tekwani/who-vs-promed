Queensland Health says the dengue fever outbreak in the state's north has
become the largest outbreak in at least 50 years. Already 901 cases of
type-3 dengue [virus infections] have been confirmed across the region.
During an outbreak in 1992/93, 900 cases were recorded in Townsville and
Charters Towers.

Queensland Health's Brian Montgomery says the total number of dengue cases
in the north is expected to pass 1000 this week [5 May 2009]. "We won't be
stepping down our resources until the outbreak is officially declared over,
which is 3 months after any active confirmed transmission," he said. "Our
commitment is to make sure this outbreak ends, now whether that's going to
be during winter, or a little bit later, is yet to be determined."

Dengue fever ravages southern Viet Nam
--------------------------------------
More than 13 000 people in southern Viet Nam have contracted dengue fever
already this year [2009], and 11 of them had died as of [3 May 2009], the
director of the Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi Minh City said on Friday [8 May
2009].

The south, where the disease is far more prevalent, accounts for 84.4 per
cent of the current number of dengue fever cases nationwide, Dr Tran Ngoc
Huu told a press conference. Dengue is no longer restricted to the rainy
season and could strike at any time of the year, he said.

Unsurprisingly, it is among the top 5 infectious diseases with the highest
numbers of cases and deaths in Viet Nam. The poor drainage in slum areas, a
result of the country's urbanization and industrialization, along with the
warm climate create the ideal conditions for dengue fever to break out.

There is no commercial vaccine to protect against dengue yet, but several
vaccines are at the experimental stage, Huu said. The Pasteur Institute is
working with Sanofi-Pasteur, the vaccines division of Sanofi-Aventis Group,
to carry out clinical studies of Sanofi's tetravalent dengue vaccine, which
is also being trialed in Thailand, the Philippines, and Singapore.

If the trials yield good results, a novel vaccine against dengue will be
available in 2015 or 2016, said Wartel Nguyen NT Anh, Sanofi-Pasteur's
regional medical director of clinical development.

The mosquitoborne disease, which is caused by any of 4 viruses, infects an
estimated 230 million people annually and is a potential threat to almost
half the world's population, according to Sanofi-Aventis.

[The hospitals from Ho Chi Minh City reported increased admissions for
dengue infection during April 2009 felt to be associated with the
unseasonal rains in the city (see prior PRO/MBDS posting Dengue - Viet Nam
(04): Ho Chi Minh City 20090416.1443).

According to the dengue annual data from WHO's Regional Office for the
Western Pacific (WHO/WPRO), available at
<http://www.wpro.who.int/sites/mvp/data/dengue/>, there were 104 393 cases
and 88 fatalities of dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DF/DHF) in
Viet Nam in 2007, 96 451 cases and 97 fatalities in 2008, and 14 107 cases
and 8 fatalities in the 1st 4 weeks of 2009.

Cambodia had also reported 871 cases and 2 deaths of dengue infection
during 2009 (see prior PRO/MBDS posting Dengue - Cambodia 20090504.1672).

Cambodian [government] alerts public over upcoming peak of dengue fever
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Cambodian government has reminded the public, cautioning against the
upcoming peak of dengue fever, which has killed 2 people nationwide so far
this year [2009], national media said on Sunday [3 May 2009].

The rainy season started earlier this year [2009], which fueled the spread
of the epidemic and brought the number of infected cases to 871 during the
1st 4 months, almost 2 times the number in the same period of last year
[2008], according to the Chinese-language newspaper the Jian Hua Daily on
Sunday [3 May 2009].

Usually, children aged from 1-9 years were the most fragile group for the
illness, minister of health Mam Bun Heng was quoted as saying in the
report. He added that some 71 per cent of the infected cases were children.
"People should frequently clean their water-storage tanks, kill mosquito
eggs in their tanks with pesticide, and sleep under anti-mosquito nets,"
said the minister.

According to official figures, in 2007, a rampant year for the disease in
the kingdom, 407 children died of it, out of a total of 39 851 infected
cases in minors.

[According to the dengue annual data from WHO's Regional Office for the

<http://www.wpro.who.int/sites/mvp/data/dengue/>, there were 39 851 cases
and 407 deaths of dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DF/DHF) in
Cambodia in 2007, 9542 cases and 65 deaths in 2008, and 151 cases with no
deaths in the 1st 4 weeks of 2009.

During 2008, a steep decline in the number of infections and deaths from
dengue fever countrywide was noted in Cambodia, which was remarked to be
due to better education and treatment for the infection (see prior PRO/MBDS
posting Dengue - Cambodia (03) 20081230.4108).

With yesterday's [7 May 2009] death of a dengue patient in Tangalle, the
total number of deaths due to the mosquitoborne disease [virus infection]
during the past 5 months of this year [2009] has risen to 55.

Dr Prabha Palihawadana, director of the Epidemiology Unit of the Ministry
of Health said a small child has died due to dengue fever yesterday [7 May
2009] at the Tangalle hospital.

The most number of deaths has been reported from Tangalle and Kegalle
areas, but dengue has spread throughout the country, Dr Palihawadana added.
According to the Health Ministry statistics nearly 4000 dengue cases have
been reported from the country in the same 5-month period.

The health officials ask the public to seek medical advice if a fever
persists for more than 3 days.

[The report from Sri Lanka of 28 Apr 2009 (ProMED-mail archive no.
20090505.1677) indicated that there had been just 6 deaths due to dengue
virus infection, but the current report (above) a week later indicates that
there have been 55 deaths, suggesting that either the dengue outbreak is
accelerating significantly or that the previous report was too low.

Dengue claims 110 victims in 5 states
-------------------------------------
Just in Bahia there were 49 deaths. In Ceara, 2 deaths are attributed to
the epidemic. There is no systematic monitoring.

While attention in the country turns to the dangers of swine flu, or
influenza A [H1N1], and although until now just 4 cases [of H1N1] have been
confirmed in the country, an old and known disease continues to claim
victims in Brazil, with dozens of deaths: dengue.

This year alone [2009], in Bahia, the deaths of 49 people with the disease,
were confirmed and there are 56 others who remain under laboratory
investigation. In relation to the same period last year [2008], the state
has had an increase of 196 per cent in the number of notified cases of the
disease, reaching 59 360 up to 25 Apr [2009], according to the report of
the Secretariat of Health of the state. In just one week, there were more
than 5000 reports [of dengue cases] in the state. Just in relation to DHF,
1145 suspected cases have been reported in the state. Of these, 416 were
confirmed. Among the 49 who died of the disease, 27 were less than 15 years
of age.

In Ceara, this year [2009] the incidence of disease has been considerably
less than in the past year [2008], but now there have been 2 confirmed
[dengue] deaths, according to the bulletin published by the state
Secretariat of Health. There are 2559 cases of the disease, with 5 DHF
[cases]. In 2008, the epidemic has infected 44 508 people in the state,
causing 18 deaths.

Another state that has had a high rate of [dengue virus] transmission and
deaths this year [2009] is Mato Grosso do Sul. There were 22 deaths from
the disease, 9 of them in Cuiaba. According to a bulletin released by the
Secretariat of Health of the state, more than 12 000 cases of classical
dengue fever were recorded this year, with another 650 [cases] of DHF.

Minas Gerais and Espirito Santo also present high numbers of the disease,
totaling 65 000 cases of the disease and 37 deaths so far [in 2009].
Totaling the cases in Bahia, Ceara, and Mato Grosso do Sul, there were 110
deaths on the 1st 5 months of the year [2009].

The Ministry of Health indicates that a decline in the number of cases in
the country in relation to the same period last year [2008] does not
represent a comfortable situation; just in the 1st 12 weeks of this year
[2009], there were 161 000 cases of the disease throughout the country
([although] 29 per cent less than the 228 000 cases confirmed in the same
period in 2008).

These data, however, are outdated, referring to the period from
January-March [2009]. With dengue, there is no one monitoring [situation]
case by case as has been done with the swine flu. The control of dengue is
done by fighting against the mosquito vector, especially with educational
action.
