The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has confirmed bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in a cow in the province of British
Columbia. This case poses no risk to human or animal health since
Canada's stringent BSE safeguards prevented any part of the animal's
carcass from entering the human food chain or any potentially
infective parts of the animal's carcass from entering the animal feed chain.

The animal was detected through Canada's national BSE surveillance
program. The CFIA has launched a comprehensive investigation in an
effort to determine the birth farm of the animal.

Canada's enhanced feed ban introduced last summer [2007] virtually
eliminates the potential spread of BSE through the animal feed chain
and places Canada on an accelerated path to eliminate BSE. As the
level of BSE continues to decline, the periodic detection of a small
number of cases is fully expected in line with the experience of
other countries. Concurrently, Canada's food safety system maintains
the highest levels of human health protection.

The national surveillance program, which targets the highest risk
animals, has tested more than 220 000 cattle since 2003. The program
continues to benefit from very strong producer participation.

The detection of this animal does not affect Canada's status as a BSE
controlled risk country as recognized by the World Organization for
Animal Health (OIE).

As has been done with previous cases, the CFIA will update
information as it becomes available through the ongoing investigation.

[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy, also known as BSE or "Mad Cow
Disease," is a progressive, fatal disease of the nervous system of
cattle. It is what is known as a transmissible spongiform
encephalopathy (TSE). Other TSEs include scrapie in sheep, chronic
wasting disease in deer and elk, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in
humans. Although the exact cause of BSE is unknown, it is associated
with the presence of an abnormal protein called a prion. There is no
treatment or vaccine currently available for the disease.

In 1993, BSE was found in a beef cow that had been imported from
Britain in 1987. The animal was destroyed, and additional measures
were taken immediately by the federal government to deal with any
risk that Canadian cattle might have been affected.

Canada's 1st case of BSE in a domestic animal was found in May 2003.
BSE has been a reportable disease in Canada since 1990.
