[1] Pakistan - EpiCore Surveillance Project follow-up to RFI
Date: Fri 19 Oct 2018
From: EpiCore Surveillance Project [edited]


An EpiCore Surveillance project member provided the following information on the "atypical" clinical presentation and vaccination history of the newly confirmed wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1)-associated disease in the Gadap area of Karachi, in Sindh province. The case involved a 42-month-old female with date of onset of disease on 22 Sep 2018. The child had a verbal history of 3 doses of oral polio vaccine (OPV) and no doses of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) as part of routine immunization activities, although this was not verified by review of a vaccination card. The child also received more than 7 doses of OPV during supplementary immunization activities.

Clinically, the child was well until falling down, after which she began to have pain in her right hip and weakness of bilateral lower extremities. An X-ray revealed a dislocation of the right hip joint.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank the EpiCore Surveillance Project members for assisting in clarifying the information (or lack of information) on this event occurring in Sindh province.

When reading the details of the clinical presentation, I am reminded of doing active surveillance for polio cases in northeastern states of Brazil, back in the early days of launching the polio-eradication effort in the Americas. We found one case that, after sustaining a fall, had been admitted and discharged from the hospital without any fractures and was discharged with a diagnosis of trauma. The lesson learned was this: during known or suspected poliovirus transmission in a geographic area (defined widely), and with a history of trauma with noticeable post-trauma acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), think polio and obtain specimens. The fall may have been a result of the AFP, rather than the cause of the AFP. Fortunately, in this instance in Pakistan, an astute healthcare worker in the "stop polio program" did obtain specimens, and poliovirus infection was confirmed. As for the history of multiple doses of OPV, unfortunately, there are instances of vaccine failures: sometimes it is failure to get the vaccine, while at other times, other competing events interfere with the vaccine viruses attaching to their receptor sites in the individual, with the verdict on the multifactoral etiologies still pending.

In Newell E et al (see ref. below), researchers postulated that tropical enteropathy and resultant inflammation from endotoxin exposure might be one etiology for the reduced immune response to multiple doses of OPV. They found that children with vaccine failure demonstrated a reduced cellular responsiveness to cytokine stimulations and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. They concluded that OPV failure (and other orally administered vaccines) was related to malnutrition, gut barrier dysfunction, and a shorter length of breastfeeding in early childhood and is associated with a chronic inflammatory immune phenotype (Newell E, Sigal N, Haque R, Kidd B, Tse T, Petri W, Davis M: Oral polio vaccination failure in urban slum children is associated with malnutrition and evidence of chronic inflammation. J Immunol. May 1, 2012; 188(1 Supplement): 166.2. http://www.jimmunol.org/content/188/1_Supplement/166.2).

So the final pending question on this case is whether there is residual paralysis at the end of the recommended 60-day observation period, or whether the identification of transient paralytic disease associated with isolation of the WPV would remain classified as a case of polio this year, as this "case" is very relevant to activities related to polio eradication efforts and outcomes.

Note we are still waiting for additional information on the other case confirmed in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. - Mod.MPP

[2] Nigeria - Bauchi, positive environmental samples cVDPV2

Type 2 polio virus found in Bauchi - WHO
-------------------
The World Health Organisation (WHO) says circulating vaccine-derived polio virus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been discovered in Bauchi State. Dr. Adamu Ningi, the WHO Bauchi state coordinator, disclosed this at a meeting with the emir of Bauchi, Alhaji Rilwanu Adamu, and the chairman, social mobilisation on immunisation and emir of Dass, Alhaji Usman Othman, in Bauchi on Friday [19 Oct 2018].

Ningi said samples were collected from various locations on a monthly basis, and it has been discovered that the polio virus type 2 was found at the Gwallaga mosque area linking 3 wards of Makama B, Hardo, and Dankade.

Represented by Dr. Khalid Abubakar, the state coordinator attributed the new strain to non-compliance to immunisation schedules. "In Bauchi LGA [local government authority], only 52 percent of children are fully immunised, 29 percent didn't complete, and 19 percent have never been immunised."

"The latest strain of the virus are from isolated environmental samples collected from Gwallaga mosque area, Obonna Royal Hotel refuse site, Shafa bridge, and FGGC [Federal Government Girls College] drainage," he added. The circulating vaccine-derived polio virus is linked to the one earlier discovered in Hadejia, Jigawa State."

Also speaking, the state chairman, social mobilisation on immunisation, said the state has been without any reported case of polio for over 5 years. Othman said he regretted to have to record a new case despite efforts to prevent [the disease's] resurgence from reported cases in Yobe and Jigawa states.

He noted that immunisation teams failed to report non-compliance cases in the past while supervision was poor. The 1st-class traditional ruler said the meeting was designed to engage the traditional institution and seek ways to contain the virus. According to Othman, since the detection, WHO, UNICEF, the state government, and traditional leaders have intensified efforts to check its spread.

In his remarks, the emir of Bauchi emphasised the need for ward heads to always accompany house-to-house teams during immunisation, plus days to avoid non-compliance. Although promising to support to eradicate the virus in his domain, Adamu, charged governments and the general public to intensify environmental sanitation and close supervision.

Speaking earlier, Dr. Shakhawar Hossain, the UNICEF state lead communication officer, said intense campaigns must be mounted, and traditional leaders should be on ground to answer key questions on polio immunisation.

[The above represents evidence that the cVDPV2 virus from Jigawa state is circulating significantly in Bauchi LGA, as seen through the identification of the virus in environmental samples taken from 4 different sites. The information that only 52 percent of children are fully immunized, 29 percent are partially immunized, and 19 percent have never been immunized in Jigawa is the perfect background "storm waiting to happen" for circulation of a cVDPV or WPV in the area. It appears as though the storm is starting. It should be noted that falling vaccination coverages are not uncommon when the disease hasn't been seen in an area for a while.

A map of Nigeria showing states can be found at: http://www.waado.org/nigerdelta/Maps/Nigeria_States.html. Bauchi is in the north-central part of Nigeria, with a sizable border to its north with Jigawa and its northeast with Yobe, both states with extensive transmission of cVDPV2. - Mod.MPP
