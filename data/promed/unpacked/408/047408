The cholera death toll in Luapula Province has risen to 3, Health Minister Joseph Kasonde has confirmed. Dr Kasonde and Nchelenge District Commissioner Joseph Chisakula said in separate interviews yesterday [3 Jan 2013] that 2 more people died of cholera in Nchelenge. On Tue 1 Jan 2013, one person died in Mwense District. Separately, Mr Chisakula said the district was putting in place measures to prevent a further spread of the disease.

Mwense District Commissioner, Victor Kasuba, said 35 patients were moved from the mission hospital to Mulundu Basic School where a cholera centre had been established. 2 other patients were admitted to Chibondo Health Centre. The 1st cases were reported on Sunday [30 Dec 2012] and samples were taken to Mansa General Hospital, where results proved positive for the waterborne disease.

District health officials had since appealed to residents in Mwense and surrounding areas to limit their movements, particularly avoiding the border areas with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The DRC's Kasenga District also had confirmed cholera cases.

The Ministry of Health had already put in place various medical interventions, including a steady supply of drugs.

According to the local health director, Eleuterio Hivilikwa, 69 cases of cholera were diagnosed in Cahama Municipal Hospital, Cunene province, between 20 and 27 Dec 2012.

During a contingency plan meeting to address the epidemic, held today [28 Dec 2012] in Ondjiva, the official also reported 3 deaths [from cholera].

He said the emergence of new cases of the disease is a result of lack of hygiene, improper water consumption, and non-compliance by some members of the community with preventive measures indicated by health authorities. Development of new cases is expected due to rains recorded in the region.

Hivilikwa said there are enough drugs to treat any cholera cases over a period of at least 3 weeks.

[3] Diarrhea - Uganda: (Kibuku)

Diarrhea outbreak in Kibuku district
------------------------------------
An outbreak of diarrhea and other waterborne [and water-]related diseases have been reported in Kabusule village Kirika sub-county Kibuku district. Kibuku district health officer, Steven Wilson Namungha, revealed this while handing over 190 water jerrycans donated by Kadama Widows Association to residents of Kabusule village on Sunday [23 Dec 2012].

Namungha said that Kibuku Health Centre IV and other health centres on average receive over 300 patients on a daily basis with waterborne-related diseases.

"Only OPD in Kibuku Health Centre IV receives about 300 patients with waterborne [and water-]related diseases on a daily basis. These cases include, diarrhea, vomiting, skin rash, bilharzia and malaria," Namungha said.

Namungha attributed the outbreak of the waterborne [and water-]related diseases to scarcity of safe clean drinking water, poor hygiene and sanitation in the households. He said that residents of Kabusule and other villages still share the few water sources with animals and that water coverage in the district stands at 42 percent below the national figure.

"With the dry season in January [2013], more people are most likely to be exposed to skin diseases because water will be scarce forcing them to use water from the ponds. The village depends on unprotected water sources with no borehole," Namungha said.

Namungha said that pit latrine coverage in the district stands at 72 percent in 32 villages and that diarrhea is 3rd to malaria to be treated in Kibuku district. Namungha warned the residents against using cassava plantation and plastic bags as pit latrine, adding that when it rains the dirt contaminates unprotected water streams.

Deputy executive officer of the Kadama Widow Association, Gorreti Nabukenya, said that the association will continue working closely with the district authorities to see that the hygiene and sanitation is improved.

"We are having talks with district leaders to see how Kadama Widow Association can come in to improve sanitation and provide more safe clean water sources to the suffering residents. We have started by providing clean water tap jerrycans. We have taught families on how to keep hygiene," Nabukenya said.

She appealed to the district authorities to establish strict bylaws that will see the families without pit latrine and dirty compounds are disciplined.
