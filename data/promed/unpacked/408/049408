Officials from Riding Mountain National Park say just 3 of more than
a thousand elk and deer tested have bovine tuberculosis.
During the winter and spring of 2007, 128 elk were captured and blood
tested as part of the park's surveillance and monitoring program. Of
these, 3 animals tested positive for bovine TB on culture. The
animals were captured from a helicopter using a net fired from a
netgun, a blood sample was taken, and then were released wearing
collars for research and tracking purposes.
Manitoba Conservation, in co-operation with Parks Canada and Manitoba
Agriculture, Food, and Rural Initiatives, also continued its
surveillance of hunter-killed elk and deer continued during the
2006-07 hunting seasons. Approximately 950 elk and deer samples were
collected from hunters and then examined at the Riding Mountain
National Park lab.
None of these animals tested positive for bovine TB.

[In 2006, the Riding Mountain National Park was declared free of
tuberculosis in livestock. The surveillance in wildlife has
continued. This low number is an indication that this disease is
hopefully being brought under control and that livestock operators
will not need to worry.
