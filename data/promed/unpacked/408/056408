The Gaston County Department of Health and Human Services has confirmed 7 cases of salmonellosis, with more people reporting symptoms. The department says many lab tests are pending, so there's a chance more cases could be confirmed soon.

The salmonellosis cases are all related to a church conference at Living Word Tabernacle Church in Bessemer City, NC. The conference went on from 1-5 Oct 2014. At least 50 people who went to the conference are reporting symptoms such as fever, stomach pains and diarrhea.

Salmonella is a bacterial infection that's usually passed on through food, water, or a surface contaminated with fecal matter from an animal or person. The bacterium is often found in meat, milk or eggs that aren't fully cooked.
