At least 8 people have died of plague in Endoji Village, Mbulu
District, in Manyara Region. The deadly disease is spread by rodents,
which have multiplied in large numbers in the area. The Mbulu
District Medical Officer, Dr John Gulisha, confirmed that 8 people
had died of the disease since 28 Feb 2007, when the 1st case was reported.
Despite the fact that medical reports indicate that only 8 people,
mainly children, had died of the disease, impeccable sources in the
village maintained that the death toll stood at 15 people.
Dr. Gulisha said symptoms of the ailment include swellings under the
armpits, high fever, and body fatigue.
Since the beginning of January 2007, rodents have invaded some
villages in Mbulu District. The situation deteriorated when villagers
started killing the rats. As more rats got killed and were discarded
at random, the bacterium [_Yersinia pestis_] that causes the disease
spread out quickly [through its flea vector - Mod.LL], causing more
infection to people, especially among children.
Dr. Gulisha said efforts had been made to control the spread of the
disease, including communicating with the Sokoine University of
Agriculture in Morogoro and the Ministry of Health and Social
Welfare. He called on villagers to cooperate with medical experts by
keeping their surroundings clean and avoiding arbitrary killing of
rats, because the practice [produced] a breeding ground of the epidemic.

[The description of symptoms suggests that the illness is bubonic
plague spread from rodent fleas. It may appear paradoxical that
killing of the rodents would cause more human cases, but the death of
rodents (either an epizooic or man-related extermination) will
produce infected and hungry fleas looking for a blood meal. If no
rodents are available, humans will do. The number of deaths is
reported (either 8 or 15) but no denominator of the total number of
cases of plague is given. Untreated bubonic plague has a case
fatality rate of 50-60 percent.
Most of the _Yersinia pestis_ reports that ProMED-mail has posted
from Africa have been from Congo DR and Uganda, although Tanzania
had one of the world's highest incidence rates in the 1980s. The
Manyara region of northeastern Tanzania can be found on a map at:
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manyara_Region>. It is bordered on the
east by Tanga region, which includes Lushoto district where 64
suspected cases were reported in 1999 up to 22 Sep, with 2 deaths --
