The original 13 Aug 2015 recall of pork products from Kapowin Meats of Graham, WA, was for approximately 116 262 pounds of whole hogs that may be contaminated with _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:-. Now, in a 27 Aug 2015 expansion of that earlier recall, approximately 523 380 pounds of pork are being recalled in varying weights of boxed and bagged whole hogs for barbecue, and varying weights of boxed and bagged fabricated pork products, including various pork offal products, pork blood and pork trim.

In addition, the 1st recall covered production between 19 Apr 2015 and 27 Jul 2015. The expanded recall extends the recall period to 26 Aug 2015, or an additional 4 weeks, USDA stated. Behind the expanded recall is a finding by USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service that recent sanitary improvements made by Kapowsin Meats were insufficient and therefore required expanding the scope of the recall.

In both recall notices, the public is advised to look for "Est. 1628" inside the USDA mark of inspection. The recalled products were distributed in Alaska, Oregon, and Washington state to individuals, retail locations, institutions and various distributors.

Meanwhile, Washington state health officials are investigating a _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:-. outbreak with 152 confirmed cases, according to USDA. 36 of those cases have been traced back to consuming whole hogs for barbecue, the agency stated.

[Like most bacterial foodborne illnesses, a combination of adequate cooking with appropriate food hygiene can minimize the risk of _Salmonella_ infection.

The outbreak strain is _Salmonella_ I, 4, 5, 12:i: -, a designation discussed by Ana Paccagnella (supervisor of the Enteric Bacteriology Section at the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control) at http://www.bcfpa.net/Attachments/Presentations/Conference2005/Naming%20Salmonella%20(A%20Paccagnella)%2008%20Nov%2005.pdf.

_Salmonella_ as a genus has 2 species, _enterica_ and _bongori_. _S. enterica_ is divided into 6 subspecies: _enterica_, _salamae_, _arizonae_, _diarizonae_, _houtenae_, and _indica_. _S. enterica_ subspecies _enterica_ (or subspecies I) strains are those usually isolated from humans or warm-blooded animals and represent a majority of the salmonellas that are clinically important.

The designation _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- means:
- the "I" reflects subspecies _enterica_;
- the "4, 12" are the O (or somatic) antigens associated with the organism. It should be noted that serotype Typhimurium carries somatic antigens 4, 5 and 12 (the Group B antigens). Paccagnella pointed out to me in an email that an O antigen underscored or placed in [ ] can refer to whether the antigen is related to phage conversion or not.
- the nomenclature after the colon, in this case i: 1,2, reflects the flagellar or H antigens. It is these H antigens that define the serotype identity within an individual group of salmonellae.

Almost all of these organisms are biphasic in regard to the H antigens, that is, they can switch from one flagellar antigen to another; as an example, _S._ Typhimurium is I 4, 5, 12:i:1,2. - Mod.LL]
