[Mali is bordered by Algeria to the north, Niger to the east, Burkina Faso and Cote d'Ivoire to the south, Guinea to the south-west, and Senegal and Mauritania to the west (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mali).

Information available from OIE's WAHID database (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statuslist) regarding countries which border Mali, indicates ASF as "demonstrated clinical disease" in Burkina Faso (January-June 2015) and Cote d'Ivoire (July-December 2015). Niger (January-June 2015), Senegal (January-June 2015), and Mauritania (July-December 2014) report ASF as absent during the reporting period. Algeria reports the disease as having never occurred in the country (July-December 2015). No information is available for Guinea. (Note: The time-periods shown in parentheses refer to the last information reported by the OIE.)

In endemic areas of Africa, the most important factors to help control the spread of the disease are to control the natural tick vectors and wild pig reservoirs and to limit their contact with domestic pigs.

During disease outbreaks, the rapid and efficient slaughter of all pigs and the proper disposal of carcasses and all waste material are critical. In addition, cleaning and disinfecting affected farms, designating infected areas, conducting surveillance, and increasing the control of animal movements will help control spread of the disease. In the presence of any suspicious hemorrhagic pig disease, a differential laboratory diagnosis should be undertaken, as low virulent ASF strains do not produce significant lesions (http://www.au-ibar.org/african-swine-fever).

ASF is not a zoonotic disease and does not affect [human] public health.
