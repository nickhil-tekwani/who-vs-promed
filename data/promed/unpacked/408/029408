[summarized by Mod. - CHC
Clues to the human pathogenicity of the H5N1 strain of influenzavirus A
(Hong Kong) have been discovered in studies by Hong Kong, CDC, and USDA
workers. In a paper (Science 279:393-396, 1998) by workers at CDC
(Subbarao, Klimov, Katz, Regnery, Lim, Hall, Perdue, Swayne, Bender, Huang,
Hemphill, Rowe, Shaw, Xu, Fukuda, and Cox [only in America!), it was
reported that the avian influenzavirus A [Hong Kong/156/97 (H5N1) is
comprised of 8 RNA segments derived from avian influenzavirus A. The
hemagglutinin contains multiple basic amino acids adjacent to the cleavage
site, a feature characteristic of highly pathogenic avian influenza A
viruses. Experimentally, the virus is highly pathogenic for chickens.
The article reported that the hemagglutinin gene contains an extra piece of
RNA, a feature common in avian flu viruses but never before isolated from a
human flu virus. It codes for extra amino acids at exactly the point at
which the protein is cleaved by enzymes in the body. That is the key step
by which the virus gains entry into avian or human cells.
In most flu viruses the enzymes needed to cleave the hemagglutinin are
found only in the lungs or digestive tract and most viruses can infect only
cells in those organs. But the extra amino acids may make the protein
capable of being cleaved by enzymes found in many organs, which then are
able to support replication of the virus. Robert Webster, a flu expert at
St Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, said that
allowed the virus to spread through the blood.
The pathogenicity studies demonstrate that the virus remains lethal to
chickens even after it has passed through a human and raises the
possibility that a few infected people travelling beyond Hong Kong could
spread it to millions of chickens worldwide.
The remaining question is how a bird virus manages to infect human. The US
team found one clue by comparing the virus isolated from Hong Kong chickens
in March with the isolate from the first case-patient. They found a
difference: the loss of a carbohydrate molecule near the point at which the
virus binds to cell surfaces. That molecule is present in the avian
samples but absent from the virus that infected the case-patient. Dr.
Webster speculates that the change "may have great influence" on the
virus's ability to bind to human cells.
Fortunately the evidence still is that the virus cannot pass easily between
human beings, limiting the chances of a pandemic. Dr. Webster told Science
he was satisfied that Hong Kong's millions of chickens in open markets had
been slaughtered. "The slaughter was absolutely essential," he said. "The
big question is whether it was done in time."
