Asturias [province of Cebu] Mayor Jose Antonio Pintor said that ricefields have been infected by Rice Tungro Disease (RTD) [in the area] . "We have to declare it under state of calamity so we could pull out their harvest."

Municipal Agriculturist Jade Mesias said there is already an outbreak of the disease. "The virus really kills the plant." He said 78 per cent of the total rice producing area in Barangay [municipality] Lunas, or 33 of the total 43 hectares are severely damaged. While 100 per cent of the rice fields in Barangay Bago covering 21 hectares are infected by RTD.

There are at least 66 farmers affected by the loss of their crops. They are now in need of food as their crops have been destroyed. [Authorities] released calamity funds to assist the farmers and to treat the rice fields. Pintor said he was assured that the provincial government would also extend assistance if the town's calamity funds will not be enough.

[Tungro is one of the most damaging rice diseases in South East Asia. Yield losses of up to 100 per cent have been reported, and the disease is spreading in the region. It is a co-infection involving _Rice tungro bacilliform virus_ (RTBV; type species and currently only member of genus _Tungrovirus_, family Caulimoviridae) and _Rice tungro spherical virus_ (RTSV; type species of genus _Waikavirus_, family Secoviridae). More than one genotype of each virus may exist in the same plant.

Symptoms include leaf discolouration, stunting, reduced tillering and reduced grain production. Losses are highest for infections early in the growth cycle. Tungro is transmitted by several leafhoppers, but the most efficient vector is the green leafhopper _Nephotettix virescens_. RTBV cannot be transmitted unless RTSV is present. Infectious vector insects can spread the viruses over long distances. The disease is not seed transmitted.

Disease management includes vector control (on both crops and adjacent vegetation), cultural practices, as well as use of rice varieties resistant to the vectors and/or the viruses. However, vector adaptation on leafhopper resistant varieties has been a problem. The presence of multiple viral genotypes in a single location suggests an unstable virus population posing a challenge to achieving durable crop resistance.
