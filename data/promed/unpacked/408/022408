In July 2011, a _Vibrio alginolyticus_ infection was diagnosed in a
woman from Guernsey in the Channel Islands, British Isles after sea
bathing and application of a natural seaweed dressing to a
pre-existing leg wound. Microbiological investigation confirmed vibrio
in the wound and the species of seaweed used for the dressing. The
washing of open wounds in seawater and use of unsterilised seaweed
dressings should be discouraged, particularly in individuals with
underlying risk conditions.

Background
----------
_V. alginolyticus_ is a halophilic (salt-tolerant) Gram negative
bacterium found naturally in temperate marine and estuarine
environments. This species is recognised as a human pathogen, and the
incidence of infection significantly increases during summer months
(1). _V. alginolyticus_ is ubiquitous in seawater and tends to cause
superficial wound and ear infections (otitis media and otitis externa)
(2). Most reports of _V. alginolyticus_ wound infections result from
exposure of cuts or abrasions to contaminated seawater. _V.
alginolyticus_-associated infections may be resolved using appropriate
antibiotics, however, very rarely these infections can progress to
bacteremia and necrotising fasciitis, particularly in the
immunocompromised.

Case report
-----------
In July 2011, a woman in her 70s presented to the dermatology clinic
in Guernsey in the Channel Isles, British Isles, with a non-healing
infected wound on her lower leg. The patient was not receiving any
medication, was otherwise healthy and had no past history of diabetes
or other chronic conditions. Two weeks previously, the patient had
injured her leg on a plant pot in the garden. The patient continued
her habit of swimming regularly in the sea off Guernsey and also
cleaned the wound with a salt water solution made up at home and
applied a seaweed dressing. The patient used a gel dressing which she
had extracted from the receptacles of spiral wrack (_Fucus spiralis_),
a seaweed collected locally from the beach at low tide, which was used
to cover the wound under cling film.

After 2 or 3 days the wound scabbed over and was left to heal. 10 days
later, the scab fell off while swimming in the sea. The wound reopened
and she reapplied the dressing as before using seaweed gel under cling
film for a further 3 days. As the wound was failing to heal, the
patient presented to the clinic.

On examination, crusting erythema surrounding the wound was noted,
indicative of an infection (Figure
http://www.eurosurveillance.org/images/dynamic/EE/V16N42/BAKER_Fig.jpg).

Laboratory analysis
-------------------
A charcoal swab was taken for bacteriological culture, and this
resulted in a pure growth of a Gram negative bacterium. Based on
colony morphology, tolerance to NaCl and case history, a pathogenic
marine vibrio was suspected, and a preliminary identification of _V.
alginolyticus_ was made after biochemical analysis using API 20E
(Biomerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). The patient was treated with
doxycycline (100 mg twice daily) for 2 weeks. At a subsequent follow
up 3 weeks later, the wound was completely healed.

Microbiological analysis was subsequently performed on the isolated
bacterial strain encompassing culture-based, molecular, and
biochemical testing for unambiguous identification and
characterisation. The bacterial cultures were subcultured on marine
agar, thiosulfate citrate bile sucrose (TCBS) agar and chromID vibrio
agar (Biomerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) overnight at 30 C and 37 C.
The distinctive morphology and color of isolated colonies
(yellow/orange on TCBS and chromID agar and cream coloration on marine
agar), coupled to biochemical analysis (97.8 per cent species-level
confirmation), were indicative of _V. alginolyticus_. Ten single
colonies of presumptive _V. alginolyticus_ strains from each set of
agar plates were subsequently analysed by PCR, using primers
recognizing 2 separate _V. alginolyticus_ species-specific targets,
collegenase and the DNA replication gene gyrB, essentially as
previously described (2-4). In both cases, positive results were
obtained confirming that the bacterium isolated was a _V.
alginolyticus_ strain.

Analysis of the seaweed and seawater samples obtained from the beach
where the patient had bathed was also performed. Seaweed samples (25 g
mechanically disrupted in a laboratory blender with 25 ml of alkaline
saline peptone water) were found positive for _V. alginolyticus_ by
PCR; however, no -_V. alginolyticus_ strains were identified in
analysed water.

Discussion and conclusions
--------------------------
_V. alginolyticus_ wound infections are rare in Europe, with sporadic
cases previously reported in the UK (5), the Netherlands (6), and
Denmark (7). Strikingly, as with other pathogenic _Vibrio_ species,
cases appear to be correlated with warm surface seawater temperatures,
and it has been suggested that the number of infections may increase
with warming of coastal regions attributed to climate change (8).
Although the summer of 2011 was not anomalously warm by recent
standards, the infection corresponded with peak surface seawater
temperatures (circa 18 C) experienced at the end of June/beginning of
July 2011. It is striking that these infections are now beginning to
be reported in temperate and "non-endemic" regions, such as in
European waters. To our knowledge, this is the 1st vibrio wound
infection reported in the UK in over 20 years.

Recent reports have suggested that the number of bathing
water-associated vibrio cases in northern Europe are increasing (8),
and other studies in Europe have reported vibrio wound infections
acquired through the intentional washing of wounds in seawater (9).
Previous work has suggested that alginate gels derived from seaweed
are highly absorbent and biodegradable dressings that can be
successfully applied to cleanse a wide variety of secreting lesions,
facilitating healing (10). To date, little reliable data is available
to demonstrate the safety of home-prepared alginate dressings used in
this context. Here, the dressing used probably represented an
effective route of exposure of an open wound to pathogenic _Vibrio_
species, initiating infection. Although the patient described here did
not have underlying medical conditions, this report highlights the
potential health risks associated with the practice of using of
non-sterile seawater and seaweed for wound cleansing purposes.

Given the recent increase in reports of more serious vibrio wound
infections in northern Europe (8), including cases associated with _V.
vulnificus_ and non-O1 _V. cholerae_, this practice should be
discouraged, particularly in vulnerable groups such as the elderly and
individuals with underlying risk conditions. Medical practitioners
should be aware and consider marine _Vibrio_ species as a possible
cause of non-healing wound infections in this group of patients.

[_V. alginolyticus_ is a halophilic Gram negative bacterium that is
part of normal marine flora. The bacterium is able to multiply in
salty waters at elevated water temperatures (1). _V. alginolyticus_ is
one of 12 recognized marine _Vibrio_ species that have been identified
as being pathogenic for humans (2). It has been associated with wound
infections (3), ear infections (4), but also with gastroenteritis (5)
and bacteremia in immunocompromised patients after consumption of raw
shellfish (6).

bailiwicks (areas of jurisdiction of a bailiff, a governor or
custodian), the Bailiwick of Guernsey and the Bailiwick of Jersey.
They are considered the remnants of the Duchy of Normandy, and are not
