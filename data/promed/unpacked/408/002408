The son of an elderly woman who died after an outbreak of strep A [group A streptococcus, also called _Streptococcus pyogenes_] in a Christchurch [New Zealand] rest home does not blame anyone for his mother's death. [The woman], 97 [years old], was 1 of 5 Bishop Selwyn Lifecare residents, aged between 86 to 97 years, who died after being admitted to Christchurch Hospital since 30 May 2014. [She] died on 5 Jun 2014. A 6th resident remains in hospital in a stable condition.

[The son of the 97 year old woman] could not believe his ''strong'' and "bubbly" mother died after catching strep A. She had only been in care since September last year [2013]. He questioned whether if she had still been in her own home she would still be alive, but accepted it was just an unfortunate event. ''We are not in a position to blame anybody for it,'' he said. "She was well cared for when she was in there." [The son] only learned about the outbreak after his mother's death, but was supportive of how the rest home handled the situation.

The remaining residents at the rest home, which is owned by Ultimate Care Group, have been swabbed and given antibiotics as a precaution despite no one else testing positive.

Ultimate Care Group general manager operations Ron Spraggon said it was difficult to trace how the infection had started as it could have been by someone who visited the home. "We are extremely disappointed that this has happened and very sympathetic to the families of the people that have passed away and also to the other [residents]," he said. Ultimate [Care Group] was working closely with the Canterbury District Health Board (CDHB) to ensure resident and staff safety, Spraggon said.

CDHB acting chief executive Mary Gordon said the response had been focused on halting transmission -- by testing and treating anyone with symptoms or who had been in close contact with the patients, including relatives and hospital staff -- using antibiotics as a preventative measure. "The response to this outbreak has been a real team effort," Gordon said.

There were no new cases but results from throat swabs showed three hospital staff members had tested positive for strep A. 2 of the 3 staff had skin swabs that showed the outbreak strain.

Canterbury medical officer of health Ramon Pink said the long-term care facility had done everything right and it had responded exceptionally quickly.

Strep A is more commonly associated with sore throats, rheumatic fever, and skin infections. It is spread by droplet or by direct contact with an infected wound. Most infections are relatively mild illnesses such as strep throat or impetigo but on rare occasions, such as when the infection is in a frail, elderly person, an infant, or someone with a weak immune system, these bacteria can cause severe and even life-threatening complications.

[The following is mostly extracted from moderator ML's comments in ProMED-mail post Streptococcus, group A, nosocomial - China: (HK) 20081231.4135:

Group A streptococci (GAS, also known as _Streptococcus pyogenes_) are an uncommon but important cause of nosocomial infections. GAS can be highly contagious and prior ProMED-mail posts (20080206.0484 and 20050308.0692) have reported spread of group A streptococcal disease in health care settings among susceptible patients and healthcare workers.

The news release above does not state whether the cases had any underlying diseases, such as open wounds, recent surgery, diabetes, or immune deficiency, which would make patients particularly vulnerable to GAS infection, though the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions are at greatest risk for invasive GAS infections, which tend to be more severe and may be complicated by shock, multisystem organ failure, and death.

Some strains of GAS are more virulent than others. Tissue invasiveness of GAS has been attributed to several virulence factors, especially the cell wall M protein, encoded by the _emm_ gene. Strains have been typed based on the antigenic specificity of its M protein. More recently GAS are typed on the basis of sequence analysis of the portion of the _emm_ gene that encodes M serospecificity (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/biotech/strep/M-ProteinGene_typing.htm). Epidemiologic studies in the US suggest that a significant percentage of the serious sequelae of group A streptococcal infections are associated with a relatively small number of specific _emm_/M protein types.

Other molecular techniques to further characterize outbreak strains include pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of chromosomal DNA fragments, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and detection of exotoxin-encoding genes (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670197901948, http://www.jstor.org/pss/30128192, http://iai.asm.org/cgi/content/short/69/4/2416, and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20687911). Molecular analysis of the isolates will aid documenting a common source outbreak. The source of a nosocomial outbreak may be an asymptomatic patient or even a healthcare worker who carries GAS either in the anus, vagina, skin, or pharynx and can shed the organism into the immediate environment despite proper gowning and gloving (see http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00056612.htm).

CDC recommends that when a nosocomial GAS infection is identified, limited screening should be undertaken among healthcare workers (HCWs) who had direct contact with the infected patient (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00056612.htm): "Screening of HCWs should include culture of the nares, throat, vagina, rectum, and skin. HCWs may return to work pending culture results. Any HCW culture-positive for GAS should refrain from patient care for the first 24 hours of antimicrobial treatment. The regimen should be tailored to the carriage site; previous reports have indicated anal carriage may be difficult to eradicate. For example, appropriate treatment for a positive rectal culture may be vancomycin 250 mg orally 4 times a day and rifampin 600 mg orally twice a day for 10 days. For a positive throat, vaginal, or skin culture, appropriate treatment may be penicillin 500 mg 4 times a day for 10 days with rifampin 600 mg orally twice a day for the last 4 days of the 10-day course.

"If surveillance identifies additional patients or HCWs with positive cultures for GAS, the isolates should be typed by _emm_, serologic, or other molecular methods to identify the strain. When the isolates are the same and a carrier has not been identified, screening should be expanded to include HCWs who had less direct patient care. CDC also recommends obtaining cultures from household contacts of implicated carriers to identify and treat potential reservoirs for reinfection. Because carriage may recur, implicated carriers should be monitored with periodic surveillance cultures for 1 year after treatment."

Bishop Selwyn Lifecare in Christchurch is "a well established complex with a commitment to providing the best possible healthcare for [its] residents" (http://www.ultimatecare.co.nz/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=95&Itemid=490). Christchurch is the largest city in the South Island, Canterbury Region of New Zealand, and the country's 3rd most populous urban area with a population of 366 000 in 2013 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christchurch). - Mod.ML
