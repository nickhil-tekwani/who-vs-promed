[1] China: bat virus ancestor to the COVID-19
Date: Sun 5 Jul 2020 8:15 AM EDT,
Source: Daily Mail [abridged, edited]
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8491491/Coronaviruss-closest-ancestor-SEVEN-YEARS-ago-bat-infested-China.html


A virus 96% identical to the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 was found in an abandoned mine in China 7 years ago, according to an investigation. The bat-infested copper mine in Mojiang, western China, was home to a coronavirus that left six adult men sick with pneumonia and 3 of them died.

Scientists took samples from the bats' faeces, found on the cave floor, and stored them in a laboratory 1000 mi [approx. 1600 km] away in Wuhan for years while studying them.

And last December [2019], Wuhan became the source of a global coronavirus pandemic which has now infected more than 11 million people and killed 525 000. That virus, named RaBtCoV/4991 at the time, now appears to be the closest relative to SARS-Cov-2, which is causing Covid-19, a Sunday Times investigation has found. The virus has reportedly featured in only one widely-available scientific paper that didn't mention the fact it had caused fatal pneumonia in humans.

The discovery that something very similar to Covid-19 was circulating in bats in Mojiang - half of bats tested in the mine were carrying at least one type of coronavirus - has raised doubts about the true source of SARS-CoV-2.

The official story has been that the Covid-19 virus jumped from an animal - thought to be a pangolin - to humans at Hunan Seafood Market in Wuhan city. From there it spread throughout the population in the densely-populated city, which is a transport hub, and then onto trains and planes and around the world within weeks.

But it could have been spreading elsewhere first, and even Chinese authorities have since admitted that the market was a 'victim' of the epidemic rather than its source. Dr Peter Daszak, a British animal disease expert, told The Sunday Times: 'It didn't emerge in the market, it emerged somewhere else.' He suggested it was already spreading somewhere around the mine in rural Mojiang and then broke out in Wuhan, which has a population of 11 million people. 'Fair assumption is that it spilt into animals in southern China and was then shipped in, via infected people, or animals associated with trade, to Wuhan.'

The RaBtCoV/4991 virus appears to have caused an illness which sounds extremely similar to Covid-19, and has a genetic code 96.2% matching with it.

The 6 men who fell ill with the virus in 2012 did so after being assigned to the mine to clear out the bat faeces - it is not clear exactly how it infected them. But the men, who ranged in age from 30 and 63, all required intensive care treatment in hospital. All had high fevers, body aches and coughs, and 5 of them were struggling to breathe.

All are symptoms that match those of Covid-19, and they tested negative for all the tropical diseases the doctors could think of, but 2 of them later tested positive in blood samples for having been infected with SARS or a SARS-like coronavirus.

The theory is the latest in a long line suggesting the possible origin of the Covid-19 virus, many of which lead back to wild bats in China.

[2] Circulating COVID-19 strain versus the Wuhan variant
[a]
Date: Sat 4 Jul 2020
Source: News Landed [edited]
https://newslanded.com/2020/07/04/the-new-strain-of-coronavirus-is-mutated-and-more-virulent/


The current SARS-CoV-2 is said to differ from the originally evolved strain from the Wuhan where disease initially developed. The study published in the journal Cell states that the virus is able to readily infect people when compared to the original strain in China. This is because the virus with the mutation is more transmissible between humans in the real world, says the study, but needs further evidence.

Dr. Anthony Fauci also stated that there is a single mutation that makes the virus replicate better and may lead to higher viral loads. He further added that we are not sure whether this worsens the disease in an individual or not. It helps the virus to replicate better and makes it more transmissible but still needs confirmation.

Researchers from various leading universities also analyzed the genome sequences of the virus in GISAID, a database where sequences are shared. They found that current variant D614G has already undergone mutation at the spike protein level. Although their findings were significant, they did not give answers as to whether the mutation was leading to the domination of the strain.

Therefore, the team went on to perform additional experiments. This led them to see that 999 British patients had a larger viral load and a more severe infection. Moreover, laboratory experiments also show us that these variants are 3 to 6 times more potent of infecting human cells. But we cannot extrapolate in vitro results to a pandemic as the situation can vary.

Currently, what we know is that there is a strain that is mutated and existing in the population. This mutated strain tells us the need for immediate focus on medication and vaccine development based on the changes in the virus. We also need a large scale study to study in detail the mutated strain so that we have more evidence on how it works.

Highlights:
- A SARS-CoV-2 variant with Spike G614 has replaced D614 as the dominant pandemic form
- The consistent increase of G614 at regional levels may indicate a fitness advantage
- G614 is associated with lower RT PCR Ct's, suggestive of higher viral loads in patients
- The G614 variant grows to higher titers as pseudotyped virions

Abstract
Korber et al. (2020) found that a SARS-CoV-2 variant in the spike protein, D614G, rapidly became dominant around the world. While clinical and in vitro data suggest that D614G changes the virus phenotype, the impact of the mutation on transmission, disease, and vaccine and therapeutic development are largely unknown.

Introduction
Following the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in China in late 2019, and the rapid expansion of the COVID19 pandemic in 2020, questions about viral evolution have come tumbling after. Did SARS-CoV-2 evolve to become better adapted to humans? More infectious or transmissible? More deadly? Virus mutations can rise in frequency due to natural selection, random genetic drift, or features of recent epidemiology.

As these forces can work in tandem, it's often hard to differentiate when a virus mutation becomes common through fitness or by chance. It is even harder to determine if a single mutation will change the outcome of an infection, or a pandemic.
The new study by Korber et al. (2020) sits at the heart of this debate. They present compelling data that an amino acid change in the virus' spike protein, D614G, emerged early during the pandemic, and viruses containing G614 are now dominant in many places around the world. The crucial questions are whether this is the result of natural selection, and what it means for the COVID-19 pandemic. For viruses like SARS-CoV-2 transmission really is everything - if they don't get into another host their lineage ends.

Korber et al. (2020) hypothesized that the rapid spread of G614 was because it is more infectious than D614. In support of their hypothesis, the authors provided evidence that clinical samples from G614 infections have a higher level of viral RNA, and produced higher titers in pseudoviruses from in vitro experiments; results that now seem to be corroborated by others [e.g. (Hu et al., 2020; LorenzoRedondo et al., 2020; Ozono et al., 2020; Wagner et al., 2020)].

Still, these data do not prove that G614 is more infectious or transmissible than viruses containing D614. And because of that, many questions remain on the potential impacts, if any, that D614G has on the COVID-19 pandemic.

Will D614G make outbreaks harder to control?

Will D614G make infections more severe?

Will D614G impact therapeutic and vaccine designs?

Conclusions
While there has already been much breathless commentary on what this mutation means for the COVID19 pandemic, the global expansion of G614 whether through natural selection or chance means that this variant now "is" the pandemic. As a result its properties matter. It is clear from the in vitro and clinical data that G614 has a distinct phenotype, but whether this is the result of bonafide adaptation to human ACE2,whether it increases transmissibility, or will have a notable effect, is not clear. The work by Korber et al. (2020) provides an early base for more extensive epidemiological, in vivo experimental, and diverse clinical investigations to fill in the many critical gaps in how D614G impacts the pandemic.

More than 500 North Wales meat plant workers have tested positive for coronavirus. Public Health Wales today said 218 employees at 2 Sisters on Anglesey and 289 at Rowan Foods in Wrexham contracted Covid-19 - bringing the total number to 507 between the sites. ...

Dr. Robin Howe, Incident Director for the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak response at Public Health Wales, said: "The multi-agency team managing the outbreak of Coronavirus associated with Rowan Foods Ltd in Wrexham has recorded a small increase of 6 cases since [Wed 1 Jul 2020], bringing the total to 289 cases.

"This is in line with what we would expect to see from focused testing. "The advice to the public has not changed and this outbreak reinforces that everyone has a vital role in preventing the spread of coronavirus by always observing social distancing guidelines - staying 2 metres away from others, and washing hands regularly...... He added: "The Food Standards Agency advises that it is very unlikely that you can catch coronavirus from food."

[4] Scientific evidence for aerosol transmission of COVID-19
Date: Sun 5 Jul 2020

https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/6819310/who-ignores-aerosol-risk-aussie-scientist/#gsc.tab=0


Six months into a pandemic that has killed more than half a million people, more than 200 scientists from around the world are challenging the official view of how the coronavirus spreads.

The World Health Organisation and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention maintain that you have to worry about only two types of transmission: inhaling respiratory droplets from an infected person in your immediate vicinity or - less common - touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth.

But other experts contend that the guidance ignores growing evidence that a third pathway also plays a significant role in contagion. They say multiple studies demonstrate that particles known as aerosols - microscopic versions of standard respiratory droplets - can hang in the air for long periods and float for several metres, making poorly ventilated rooms, buses and other confined spaces dangerous even when people stay 1.8 metres from one another.

"We are 100% sure about this," said Lidia Morawska, a professor of atmospheric sciences and environmental engineering at Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane.

She makes the case in an open letter to the WHO accusing the United Nations agency of failing to issue appropriate warnings about the risk. A total of 239 researchers from 32 countries signed the letter, which is set to be published next week in a scientific journal.

In interviews, experts said that aerosol transmission appears to be the only way to explain several "super-spreading" events, including the infection of diners at a restaurant in China who sat at separate tables and of choir members in the US state of Washington who took precautions during a rehearsal.

WHO officials have acknowledged that the virus can be transmitted through aerosols but say that occurs only during medical procedures such as intubation that can spew large quantities of the microscopic particles.

Dr. Benedetta Allegranzi, a top WHO expert on infection prevention and control, said in responses to questions from the Los Angeles Times that Morawska and her group presented theories based on laboratory experiments rather than evidence from the field. "We value and respect their opinions and contributions to this debate," Allegranzi wrote in an email.

But in weekly teleconferences, a large majority of a group of more than 30 international experts advising the WHO has "not judged the existing evidence sufficiently convincing to consider airborne transmission as having an important role in COVID-19 spread". She added that such transmission "would have resulted in many more cases and even more rapid spread of the virus".

The proponents of aerosol transmission said masks worn correctly would help prevent the escape of exhaled aerosols as well as inhalation of the microscopic particles.

But they said the spread could also be reduced by improving ventilation and zapping indoor air with ultraviolet light in ceiling units.

Jose Jimenez, a University of Colorado chemist who signed the letter, said the idea of aerosol transmission should not frighten people. "It's not like the virus has changed," he said. "We think the virus has been transmitted this way all along, and knowing about it helps protect us."

[If airborne transmission is a significant factor in the pandemic, especially in crowded spaces with poor ventilation, the consequences for containment will be significant. Masks may be needed indoors, even in socially distant settings. Health care workers may need N95 masks that filter out even the smallest respiratory droplets as they care for coronavirus patients. The International agencies such as the WHO and CDC recommendations are issued with a global perspective, including countries with limited resources which will require consideration of availability, feasibility, implementation efficiency, compliance, and ultimately resource implications. The answers will be eventually be clear-Mod.UBA]

Drug Trials
-----------
WHO said that it was discontinuing its trials of the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine and combination HIV drug lopinavir/ritonavir in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 after the medications failed to reduce mortality.

African Region
--------------
Madagascar
Madagascar has placed its capital Antananarivo under a fresh lockdown following a new surge in coronavirus infections, 2 months after the restrictions were eased, the presidency announced. No traffic will be allowed in or out of the region starting Monday until [20 Jul 2020]. The country had a cumulative 2728 cases to date, including 29 deaths since the virus was first detected on the Indian ocean island on [20 Mar 2020].

South Africa
South Africa is reporting more than 10 000 new confirmed coronavirus cases for the 1st time in a single day. That brings the country's total confirmed cases to more than 187 977, by far the most of any country in Africa. South Africa also has surpassed the deaths of 3000 people in the outbreak.

Eastern Mediterranean Regions: Saudi Arabia, UAE , Morocco
----------------------------------------------------------
Saudi Arabia's coronavirus infections have surpassed 200 000 and neighbouring United Arab Emirates 50 000, with the number of new cases climbing after the Arab world's 2 largest economies fully lifted curfews last month. Restrictions had been in place in both countries since mid-March [2020] and their gradual lifting has allowed commercial businesses and public venues to reopen.

Other Gulf countries have also moved to ease restrictions, although Kuwait has maintained a partial curfew and Qatar, Bahrain and Oman did not impose one at all.

Morocco
Morocco reported [Sun 5 Jul 2020] 698 additional novel coronavirus infections, the highest one-day increase since the outbreak began in early March [2020], with numerous cases discovered in a port city factory. The new figures bring the official total in the North African kingdom to 14 132 infections and 234 deaths, according to the health ministry.

The majority of the new infections were detected in a fish canning factory in the southern port city of Safi. Morocco, with a population of around 35 million, eased virus-related restrictions on [25 Jun 2020], reopening cafes, restaurants, hotels and sports halls. It also allowed domestic tourism and inter-city travel. [Fadel Senna/AFP]

Resumption of Air Travel
------------------------
Turkish Airlines
Turkey's flag carrier resumed flights to Indonesia after being suspended on [20 Mar 2020] amid the coronavirus pandemic. Turkish Airlines will resume routes to Indonesia with 2 flights per week. Turkish Airlines Boeing 737-800 plane TC-JVV taxies to take-off in Riga International Airport. The airlines conducted its first scheduled flight between Jakarta and Istanbul at 10.05 am local time. It did not announce when flights to the holiday island of Bali would begin. [Ints Kalnins/Reuters]

Ireland: Easing Restrictions
----------------------------
Ireland is to ease quarantine restrictions on people travelling from abroad on 20 Jul 2020], with people from a "green list" of countries with low COVID-19 rates to be exempt from isolating themselves for 14 days, transport minister Eamon Ryan said.

Former prime minister Leo Varadkar in June [2020] said that the restrictions would be eased from [9 Jul 2020]. "A so-called green list... will be published on [20 Jul 2020]," Ryan said in an interview with Newstalk radio station.

Australia: Lockdowns
--------------------
The hard-hit Australian state of Victoria has recorded 74 new coronavirus cases on [Sun 5 Jul 2020] after announcing a record 108 new infections a day earlier. The latest increase resulted in state Premier Daniel Andrews announcing a lockdown of 9 inner-city public housing blocks containing 3000 people, where 27 cases have been detected.

Police are guarding every entrance of the housing estates and residents are not allowed to leave their homes for any reason. Australia had more than 8400 cases and 104 deaths as of [Sun 5 Jul 2020].

South America: Mexico, Brazil
-----------------------------
Mexico
Mexico's health ministry has reported 523 more deaths from the novel coronavirus, bringing the total to 30 366, and 6014 new infections, bringing the total to 252 165. The government has previously said the actual number of infected people is likely significantly higher than the number of confirmed cases.

Citing unpublished figures from the country's civil registry, broadcaster Milenio reported that as of [19 Jun 2020], nearly twice as many people had died from the coronavirus than were reported by Deputy Health Minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell. Reuters news agency was unable to verify the information.

Brazil
Brazil has recorded 37 923 new confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus in the past 24 hours as well as 1091 deaths, Reuters news agency reported, quoting the country's health ministry. Brazil has registered more than 1.5 million cases since the pandemic began, while cumulative deaths total 64 265, according to the ministry.

[In the past 24 hours, according to the report at the source URL, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 48 cases with one new death, compared with 61 cases and no new death in the previous day (4 Jul 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 83 consecutive days. There were 24 locally transmitted cases: Gwangju (7), Incheon (5), Gyeonggi (5), Seoul (2), Daejeon (2), Jeollanam(2), and Gangwon(1), and 24 imported cases -- airport quarantine (15), Deagu(2), Seoul(1), Busan(1), Incheon(1), Gyeonggi (1), Gyeongbuk (1), Gyeongnam (1), and Gangwon(1). There were 5 provinces reporting no newly confirmed cases.

According to data from the "ncov" website of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the cumulative confirmation rate has been steady at 1.0% (http://ncov.mohw.go.kr/).

The overall impression hasn't changed: Lifting of measures has been accompanied by increases in locally acquired infections through increasing clusters related to gatherings of people at employment (bringing it outside employment to contacts) and in houses of worship, and bars and clubs. But, that being said, importations are also playing a major role in the country. It would be nice to know the asymptomatic rate being detected, and the proportion of asymptomatic infections detected that go on to clinical disease.

Tabular and graphic analyses of the situation in South Korea with the addition of the 63 newly confirmed cases from 5 Jul 2020 are available at the English language page (https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=a30402000000&bid=0030), notices 417 and 418. There are analyses of the country-wide situation including the newly confirmed cases including listings of current ongoing clusters. A total of 3 of the clusters mentioned are related to religious gatherings, 1 related to an elementary school, 1 related to an office building, 1 related to a nursing home and 1 related to an apartment complex.

Importations (24) came from Americas (3) and Asia excluding China (21) (Kazakhstan 8, Russia 4, Pakistan 3, India 3, Bangladesh 1, Qatar=1; Philippines=1).

[As of 5 Jul 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran is 240 438, including 11 571 deaths, an increase of 2560 cases and 163 deaths since 4 Jul 2020. The numbers of daily reported cases and deaths are slowing increasing.

Takeaway message: Premature lifting of restrictions is taking its toll in Iran as is elsewhere in the world. Unfortunately, many people think that lifting of restrictions means the virus has gone away and measures like mask wearing and social distancing are no longer necessary leading to resurgences of increased transmission and the resultant increase in severe cases and deaths. And the need to re-implement some forms of lockdown to flatten the curves again so the health systems aren't overwhelmed.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA as per Worldometer data for the top 20 reporting entities. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 2 982 928, including 132 569 deaths, an increase from 2 935 770 cases and 132 318 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York City had a cumulative total of 213 852 cases as of 13:30 EDT (GMT-4) on 4 Jul 2020 (+291 from 2 Jul 2020), including 18 583 confirmed deaths (+28 since 4 Jul 2020) and an additional 4607 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

The top 10 states in terms of daily reported cases in descending order are Florida, Texas, California, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee and Alabama. This list includes states that are showing major increases in daily cases reported beginning with the lifting of restrictions around the end of May 2020. All states reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, with the range being 1091 to 10 059.

In terms of cumulative case reports, 41 states and entities have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.

In the past 24 hours, the proportion of newly confirmed cases was 2.0%. The 7-day average of newly confirmed cases for the past 7 days is 38.0% higher than the 7-day average for the preceding 7 days, consistent with the ongoing pandemic in the country picking up momentum.

The CDC website https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html has data on cases, hospitalization, testing, and epidemiologic variables such as age, race, ILI (influenza-like illness), surveillance, and emergency room visits, which are definitely worth reviewing, as a welcome series of analyses. According to the CDC data, the percentages of laboratory specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 with a molecular assay is 9% positive tests out of 36 255 888 tests performed, consistent with the ongoing, as yet not under control pandemic in the country (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html).

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update (please note that there has been consistent weekend reporting artifact since the presentation of these data began):

The Americas region reported 60.1% of the global newly reported cases and 66.2% of newly reported deaths for this 24-hour period. The USA reported 42.4% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, and Brazil reported 34.5%, Mexico 5.5%, Chile 3.1%, Peru 2.9%, Colombia 2.7%, and Argentina 2.3%. The same 5 countries remained at the top; the USA and Brazil are usually numbers 1 and 2; while they vary for which of the 2 positions they hold, this week the USA has dominated with the proportion represented by Brazil decreasing. Other countries are continuing to increase their proportional representation within the region such as Mexico, Colombia, Peru and periodically Chile and Argentina.

The European region reported 8.2% of the global newly reported cases and 7.1% of the newly confirmed deaths in the region. Russia reported 40.4% of the regional newly confirmed cases, followed by Kazakhstan 8.7%, Turkey 6.9%, Israel 5.6%, Armenia 4.2%, UK 3.7%, Azerbaijan 3.2% and Romania 2.5%. The case numbers for France, Spain, Sweden and Ukraine are not available in today's update. The proportion of cases represented by Russia continues to decrease. Armenia, Azerbaijan, Israel, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Ukraine are prominent in countries noted to have resurgence in Europe.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 9.1% of the global newly reported cases and 10.6% of global newly reported fatalities. Saudi Arabia reported 22.3% of the regional newly reported cases followed Pakistan by 17.3%, Iran 13.3%, Iraq 12.6%, Egypt 7.1%, Oman 6.4%, UAE 3.8 %, and Kuwait 3.3%. Multiple countries are very active in the region -- same countries with some changes in the order since yesterday (4 Jul 2020) -- Egypt moved to number 5 in the daily case numbers.

The African region reported 7.0% of the global newly reported cases and 2.3% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 76.2% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Nigeria 4.2%, Ghana 3.5%, Algeria 3.0%, Kenya 2.7%, Cote d'Ivoire 1.7%, and Madagascar 1.5% .South Africa and Nigeria are usually numbers 1 and 2, and other countries have less consistent reporting patterns and vary considerably from day to day. Of note is that South Africa is now reporting over 10 000 cases in a day.

The Western Pacific region reported 1.0% of the global newly reported cases and 0.19% of global deaths. The Philippines reported 70.4% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Japan 11.3%, Singapore 8.7%, Australia 5.0%, South Korea 2.8%, and China 0.89%. The Philippines is consistently reporting the highest number of cases with at number 2...

The South East Asia region reported 14.6% of the global newly reported cases and 13.5% of global deaths. India reported 83.2% of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 11.1%, Indonesia 4.8%, and Nepal .77%. India continues to be the driving force in the regional growth in cases.

Impression: The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed cases on a daily basis, followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean alternating on a daily basis of their order, followed by the Africa region and the Western Pacific representing the lowest daily case load of all of the regions. The Africa region is slowing increasing their representation in terms of increased case reporting.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 5 Jul 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent visual representation of the epidemic as described in the above text. The Americas region continues to increase, as does South-East Asia, in terms of daily newly confirmed cases; the African region is noticeably increasing as well. The Americas region continues to greatly outnumber all other regions for daily reporting. - Mod.UBA]

[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of reported cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 11 550 542, with reports of cases by 217 countries and territories worldwide. The global case count rose by 1.5% in the past 24 hours. The USA, with more than 2.98 million confirmed cases, now represents 25.6% of the global cases of COVID-19, and Brazil with more than 1.6 million cases represents 13.7% of the global cases of COVID-19. Other countries such as Chile, Peru, Mexico, India, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Pakistan are reporting increased numbers of new and cumulative cases as well. If one tallies the total cumulative case counts for the top 5 countries (USA, Brazil, Russia, India, and Spain), they represent over half of the total cases reported globally (53.9%). A global total of 533 388 deaths have been reported, an increase of 3057 deaths in the past 24 hours.

A reminder that in the absence of well-developed contact-tracing activities with testing of asymptomatic and mildly ill contacts, numbers of SARS-CoV-2 virus infections are significantly underreported: actual numbers may be 10-20 times larger. There are also individuals who stay at home throughout their illness, sometimes, unfortunately, dying at home, who are never officially confirmed as infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These data are presented to provide relative indicators of the situations in each of the countries and comparisons between countries and regions of the world.

In descending rank order, the USA is number 1 for cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19, followed by Brazil, India [India surpassed Russia in the last 24 hours], Russia, Peru [surpassed Spain in the last 24 hours], Spain, Chile, the UK, Mexico and Italy at number 10. China remains at number 22. In descending rank order, the USA is number 1 for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by Brazil, India, South Africa, Mexico, Russia, Chile, Peru, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed cases went from 3191 to 44 530.

The top 20 countries in terms of cumulative cases include 7 from the European region, 7 from the Americas region, 3 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 from the South-East Asia region, and 1 from the African region unchanged for the past 4 days. There are no countries from the Western Pacific region. The top 20 countries in terms of numbers of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours include 8 from the Americas region, 6 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 6 from the South East Asia region, 2 from the European region, 1 each from the African and Western Pacific region.
