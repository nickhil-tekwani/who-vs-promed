Re: BSE - Japan: 37th case, atypical, RFI
-----------------------------------------
The details in the above, just published posting 20111129.3480 are
very similar to those of the "real" 8th case in 2003, as included in
posting 20031008.2526.

Are you certain this is a new case or is it a recirculation of an
older article?

[Dr Detweiler's comment is right; we are grateful for her alertness
and regret the recycling of this old piece of information.

A similar response has been received from Terry S. Singeltary Sr, who
is kindly acknowledged.

Japan's most recent case of BSE remains, thus, the one of January 2009
as described in the review of Japan's BSE history, included in the
commentary to posting 20111129.3480. - Mod.AS
