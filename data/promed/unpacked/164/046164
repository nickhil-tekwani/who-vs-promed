The 2nd meeting of the Emergency Committee convened by the WHO director-general under the International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005) regarding the outbreak of novel coronavirus 2019 in the People's Republic of China, with exportations to other countries, took place on Thu 30 Jan 2020, from 13:30 to 18:35 Geneva time (CEST). The Committee's role is to give advice to the director-general, who makes the final decision on the determination of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The Committee also provides public health advice or suggests formal Temporary Recommendations as appropriate.

Proceedings of the meeting
--------------------------
Members and advisors of the Emergency Committee were convened by teleconference. The director-general welcomed the Committee and thanked them for their support. He turned the meeting over to the chair, Professor Didier Houssin. Professor Houssin also welcomed the Committee and gave the floor to the secretariat.

A representative of the department of compliance, risk management, and ethics briefed the Committee members on their roles and responsibilities. Committee members were reminded of their duty of confidentiality and their responsibility to disclose personal, financial, or professional connections that might be seen to constitute a conflict of interest. Each member who was present was surveyed, and no conflicts of interest were judged to be relevant to the meeting. There were no changes since the previous meeting. The chair then reviewed the agenda for the meeting and introduced the presenters.

Representatives of the Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China reported on the current situation and the public health measures being taken. There are now 7711 confirmed and 12 167 suspected cases throughout the country. Of the confirmed cases, 1370 are severe and 170 people have died; 124 people have recovered and been discharged from hospital.

The WHO secretariat provided an overview of the situation in other countries. There are now 83 cases in 18 countries. Of these, only 7 had no history of travel in China. There has been human-to-human transmission in 3 countries outside China. One of these cases is severe, and there have been no deaths.

At its 1st meeting, the Committee expressed divergent views on whether this event constitutes a PHEIC or not. At that time, the advice was that the event did not constitute a PHEIC, but the Committee members agreed on the urgency of the situation and suggested that the Committee should continue its meeting on the next day, when it reached the same conclusion.

This 2nd meeting takes place in view of significant increases in numbers of cases and additional countries reporting confirmed cases.

Conclusions and advice
--------------------------
The Committee welcomed the leadership and political commitment of the very highest levels of Chinese government, their commitment to transparency, and the efforts made to investigate and contain the current outbreak. China quickly identified the virus and shared its sequence so that other countries could diagnose it quickly and protect themselves, which has resulted in the rapid development of diagnostic tools.

The very strong measures the country has taken include daily contact with WHO and comprehensive multi-sectoral approaches to prevent further spread. It has also taken public health measures in other cities and provinces and is conducting studies on the severity and transmissibility of the virus as well as sharing data and biological material. The country has also agreed to work with other countries who need their support. The measures China has taken are good not only for that country but also for the rest of the world.

The Committee acknowledged the leading role of WHO and its partners. The Committee also acknowledged that there are still many unknowns; cases have now been reported in 5 WHO regions in one month, and human-to-human transmission has occurred outside Wuhan and outside China.

The Committee believes that it is still possible to interrupt virus spread, provided that countries put in place strong measures to detect disease early, isolate and treat cases, trace contacts, and promote social distancing measures commensurate with the risk. It is important to note that as the situation continues to evolve, so will the strategic goals and measures to prevent and reduce spread of the infection. The Committee agreed that the outbreak now meets the criteria for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and proposed the following advice to be issued as Temporary Recommendations.

The Committee emphasized that the declaration of a PHEIC should be seen in the spirit of support and appreciation for China, its people, and the actions China has taken on the frontlines of this outbreak, with transparency, and, it is to be hoped, with success. In line with the need for global solidarity, the Committee felt that a global coordinated effort is needed to enhance preparedness in other regions of the world that may need additional support for that.

Advice to WHO
-----------------
The Committee welcomed a forthcoming WHO multidisciplinary technical mission to China, including national and local experts. The mission should review and support efforts to investigate the animal source of the outbreak, the clinical spectrum of the disease and its severity, the extent of human-to-human transmission in the community and in healthcare facilities, and efforts to control the outbreak. This mission will provide information to the international community to aid in understanding the situation and its impact and enable sharing of experience and successful measures.

The Committee wished to re-emphasize the importance of studying the possible source, to rule out hidden transmission, and to inform risk management measures. The Committee also emphasized the need for enhanced surveillance in regions outside Hubei, including pathogen genomic sequencing, to understand whether local cycles of transmission are occurring.

WHO should continue to use its networks of technical experts to assess how best this outbreak can be contained globally.

WHO should provide intensified support for preparation and response, especially in vulnerable countries and regions.

Measures to ensure rapid development and access to potential vaccines, diagnostics, antiviral medicines, and other therapeutics for low- and middle-income countries should be developed.

WHO should continue to provide all necessary technical and operational support to respond to this outbreak, including with its extensive networks of partners and collaborating institutions, to implement a comprehensive risk communication strategy, and to allow for the advancement of research and scientific developments in relation to this novel coronavirus.

WHO should continue to explore the advisability of creating an intermediate level of alert between the binary possibilities of PHEIC or no PHEIC, in a way that does not require reopening negotiations on the text of the IHR (2005).

WHO should timely review the situation with transparency and update its evidence-based recommendations.

The Committee does not recommend any travel or trade restriction based on the current information available.

The director-general declared that the outbreak of 2019-nCoV constitutes a PHEIC and accepted the Committee's advice and issued this advice as Temporary Recommendations under the IHR.

To the People's Republic of China:
--------------------------------------
Continue to
- implement a comprehensive risk communication strategy to regularly inform the population on the evolution of the outbreak, the prevention and protection measures for the population, and the response measures taken for its containment;
- enhance public health measures for containment of the current outbreak;
- ensure the resilience of the health system and protect the health workforce;
- enhance surveillance and active case finding across China;
- collaborate with WHO and partners to conduct investigations to understand the epidemiology and the evolution of this outbreak and measures to contain it;
- share relevant data on human cases;
- continue to identify the zoonotic source of the outbreak, and particularly the potential for circulation with WHO as soon as it becomes available;
- conduct exit screening at international airports and ports, with the aim of early detection of symptomatic travelers for further evaluation and treatment, while minimizing interference with international traffic.

To all countries:
----------------
It is expected that further international exportation of cases may appear in any country. Thus, all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, contact tracing, and prevention of onward spread of 2019-nCoVinfection, and to share full data with WHO. Technical advice is available on the WHO website.

Countries are reminded that they are legally required to share information with WHO under the IHR.

Any detection of 2019-nCoV in an animal (including information about the species, diagnostic tests, and relevant epidemiological information) should be reported to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) as an emerging disease.

Countries should place particular emphasis on reducing human infection, prevention of secondary transmission and international spread, and contributing to the international response though multi-sectoral communication and collaboration and active participation in increasing knowledge on the virus and the disease, as well as advancing research.

The Committee does not recommend any travel or trade restriction based on the current information available.

Countries must inform WHO about any travel measures taken, as required by the IHR. Countries are cautioned against actions that promote stigma or discrimination, in line with the principles of Article 3 of the IHR.

The Committee asked the director-general to provide further advice on these matters and, if necessary, to make new case-by-case recommendations, in view of this rapidly evolving situation.

To the global community:
---------------------------
As this is a new coronavirus, and it has been previously shown that similar coronaviruses required substantial efforts to enable regular information sharing and research, the global community should continue to demonstrate solidarity and cooperation, in compliance with Article 44 of the IHR (2005), in supporting each other on the identification of the source of this new virus, its full potential for human-to-human transmission, preparedness for potential importation of cases, and research for developing necessary treatment.

Provide support to low- and middle-income countries to enable their response to this event, as well as to facilitate access to diagnostics, potential vaccines, and therapeutics.

Under Article 43 of the IHR, States Parties implementing additional health measures that significantly interfere with international traffic (refusal of entry or departure of international travellers, baggage, cargo, containers, conveyances, goods, and the like, or their delay, for more than 24 hours) are obliged to send to WHO the public health rationale and justification within 48 hours of their implementation. WHO will review the justification and may request countries to reconsider their measures. WHO is required to share with other States Parties the information about measures and the justification received.

The Emergency Committee will be reconvened within 3 months or earlier, at the discretion of the director-general.

The director-general thanked the Committee for its work.

Europe's 1st case of human-to-human transmitted coronavirus was confirmed in Germany on Tuesday [28 Jan 2020]. The infected 33-year-old man from the Starnberg area of Bavaria caught the virus from a company colleague visiting from China. Both work at automotive supplier Webasto, headquartered near Munich.

The Robert Koch Institute said that the case in Germany is the 1st recorded instance of the virus being transmitted outside Asia. The Bavarian health ministry said that there appears to be no more cases in Germany, and that the risk of the infection spreading is low.

The Chinese employee from Shanghai had come to Webasto's German headquarters for a seminar on 21 Jan 2020, but "started to feel sick on the flight home on 23 Jan [2020]," head of the Bavarian state office for health and food safety, Andreas Zapf, said on Tuesday [28 Jan 2020].

She tested positive for the coronavirus on her return to China. The woman's parents, whom she had met in the days before she travelled to Germany, were from the Wuhan region of China, where the virus originated.

The only 2 Indian carriers that fly to China -- IndiGo and Air India -- on Wednesday [29 Jan 2020] announced suspension of most of their flights to the country that is battling a coronavirus outbreak, joining other airlines based in Asia, North America, and Europe that have restricted operations to the region, as the deadly virus spread to at least 17 countries.

India has requested China for permission to operate 2 flights to bring back its nationals from Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak, the Ministry of External Affairs said. The Indian Embassy in Beijing on Wednesday [29 Jan 2020] circulated registration forms and consent notes for the Indians in Wuhan and Hubei province to be filled out by them. A fresh travel advisory asking people to refrain from travelling to China has been issued by the Centre, which has ramped up screening across airports, ports and borders.

British Airways halted all flights to China, and American Airlines suspended Los Angeles flights to and from Shanghai and Beijing as efforts to contain a new virus intensifies.

The coronavirus has now infected more people in China than were sickened in the country by the SARS outbreak in 2002-2003. The number of confirmed cases jumped to 5974, surpassing the 5327 in mainland China from SARS. The virus has killed more than 130 people.

The British and US carriers on Wednesday [29 Jan 2020] joined several Asian carriers that are either suspending or significantly cutting back service there as fears spread about the coronavirus.

Air India and South Korean budget-carrier Seoul Air are also halting all flights to the country, and Indonesia's Lion Air plans to do the same. Other carriers, including Finnair, Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific, and Singapore-based Jetstar Asia, are slashing service.

Beyond disrupting travel, the move is heightening concerns about the broader economic impact of the virus outbreak. Hotels, airlines, casinos, and cruise operators are among the industries suffering the most immediate repercussions, especially in countries close to China. The crisis has also begun to ripple through US companies with operations in China.

Starbucks shares tumbled 2.5% Wednesday [29 Jan 2020] after the company said it will take a financial hit from store closures in China. The Seattle-based coffee giant said more than half of its 4292 stores in China are now closed. China represented 10% of Starbucks revenue during its most recent quarter.

By contrast, McDonald's shares were up 2% Wednesday [29 Jan 2020] after the company said the financial impact so far has been minimal. McDonald's President and CEO Chris Kempczinski said the Chicago-based company has closed several hundred restaurants, including all of its properties in Hubei province. But 3000 remain open elsewhere in the country. China accounts for 4-5% of McDonalds' revenue, he said.

British Airways said it was immediately suspending all flights to and from mainland China after the UK government warned against unnecessary travel to the country amid a virus outbreak.

The airline operates daily flights from London's Heathrow Airport to Shanghai and Beijing. It took the measure a day after Britain's Foreign Office updated its travel advice on China, warning against all but essential travel to the mainland, not including Hong Kong and Macao.

The US has not put into place travel restrictions, though Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said it's important to not take anything off the table, when he was asked about that potential.

American Airlines said Wednesday [29 Jan 2020] it will suspend flights between Los Angeles and both Shanghai and Beijing 9 Feb-27 Mar [2020]. The airline cited the significant decline in demand for travel to and from China. Flights from Dallas-Fort Worth will continue, the airline said.

China has cut off access to the central city of Wuhan, epicenter of the outbreak, and 16 other cities to prevent people from leaving and spreading the virus further. That has trapped more than 50 million people in the most far-reaching disease control measures ever imposed. The outbreak has infected more than 6000 on the mainland and abroad.

Online flight notice boards for the Beijing and Shanghai airports showed numerous cancellations for both domestic and foreign airlines on Wednesday [29 Jan 2020]:

- Air Seoul, a budget airline, became the 1st South Korean airline to suspend its flights to mainland Chinese destinations apart from Wuhan, stopping its flights to the cities of Zhangjiajie and Linyi.

- Indonesia's Lion Air said it has canceled more than 50 flights to China well into February [2020]. The flights are from 5 international airports in Manado, Surabaya, Jakarta, Batam, and Denpasar, in Bali, to 15 airports in China. The suspension will be phased in gradually and continue until further notice.

- Hong Kong airlines are cutting the number of their flights to the mainland by about half through the end of March [2020] in response to government virus-control efforts.

- Cathay Pacific Group said flights to 24 mainland destinations would be reduced to 240 weekly. The company owns Cathay Pacific Airways, cargo carrier Air Hong Kong, Cathay Dragon, and Hong Kong Express.

- Air India is suspending Delhi-Shanghai flights, which operate 6 times a week, from Friday [31 Jan 2020] until 14 Feb [2020].

- Finland's Finnair, which has actively promoted its position linking Asian and Western destinations, said it was canceling 3 weekly flights to Beijing Daxing International Airport through late March [2020], as well as its twice-weekly flights to Nanjing.

- Jetstar Asia will temporarily suspend flights to the Chinese cities of Hefei, Guiyang, and Xuzhou starting Thursday [30 Jan. 2020] through the end of March [2020] due to a drop in demand.

- South Korea's 2nd-largest carrier, Asiana Airlines, will temporarily suspend flights to the Chinese cities of Guilin, Changsha, and Haikou starting next month [February 2020].

- Korean Air, South Korea's biggest airline, said it is also considering grounding some of its flights to mainland China as passenger demand drops. Korean Air had operated 4 flights a week to the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, before suspending them on 23 Jan 2020.

- Taiwan's Eva Air announced a partial cancellation of flights to and from mainland China for 2 weeks starting 2 Feb 2020. In addition, the airline also has stopped providing towels, magazines, and tablecloths and is limiting use of blankets and pillows on its flights.

- Kazakhstan, which shares a long border with far western China, announced Wednesday [29 Jan 2020] that it plans to suspend all flights, train, and bus traffic and to halt issuing visas to Chinese nationals. Before the Wednesday [29 Jan 2020] suspension, there were 24 flights a week from Kazakhstan to China, including a daily flight to the capital of Xinjiang.

- Japan's JAL said it had not changed its flight plans, while German carrier Lufthansa said it was monitoring the situation "very closely" and would, if necessary, make changes in consultation with the authorities.

- Dutch carrier KLM is cutting a number of flights to Chinese cities for a month because of a drop in bookings. As of Thursday [30 Jan 2020], it is suspending direct flights to Chengdu and Hangzhou. Flights to Xiamen will be suspended from Friday [31 Jan 2020]. The carrier also is reducing the number of flights to Shanghai from 11 to 7 per week.

- Air Canada, the country's largest carrier, is temporarily suspending all direct flights to Beijing and Shanghai. Flights will be suspended until 29 Feb 2020. Air Canada operates direct flights to Beijing and Shanghai from Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver.

[11] Economic costs

https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-insurance/many-global-firms-excluded-from-epidemic-insurance-face-heavy-coronavirus-costs-idUKKBN1ZS1CU


Many global companies from hotels and airlines to industrial houses are expected to have to foot the bill for disruptions caused by a new coronavirus in China, with epidemics usually excluded from insurance cover, experts said.

With 132 deaths in China and new cases being reported around the world, companies are set to face billions of dollars in losses linked to events and travel cancellations and closure of businesses, they said.

The virus originated in the city of Wuhan, forcing airlines to cancel flights and companies including Facebook and HSBC to suspend travel to China.

"For insurers, the bulk of the claims from this outbreak will come from businesses, mainly travel, hospitality, and event firms, followed by mortality and healthcare costs," said a Hong Kong-based insurance sector lawyer with a global law firm.

Risk modeling firm RMS said it was too early to estimate insured losses.

While some large global firms buy coverage for communicable diseases, most "standard insurance policies" exclude such outbreaks to keep costs low, said the lawyer, declining to be identified as he was not authorized to speak to the media.

Global insurers typically cover risks such as earthquakes and plane crashes, but have been paring back exposure to certain risks, such as shipping, to avoid huge losses.

Previous viruses, such as SARS, Ebola, and Zika, have also led insurers to be more cautious about exposure, with specific virus exclusions added to most basic coverage policies, industry insiders said.

The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome [SARS] pandemic, which spread to 37 countries in 2003, caused $4 billion worth of economic losses in Hong Kong, $3-$6 billion in Canada, and $5 billion in Singapore, according to insurance broker Marsh.

Insurance experts also told Reuters that most event cancellation policies would not cover the new virus.

"A lot of these airlines and hotels are offering refunds to their customers," said Richard Coyle, London-based head of risk financing and non-standard solutions at Miller Insurance. "Without adequate insurance in place, the airlines and hotels are absorbing the financial losses themselves."

A standard event cancellation policy issued by firms in the 99-member Lloyd's of London insurance market and elsewhere has a "communicable disease" exclusion, 2 underwriters said.

Companies buy business-interruption policies with their property insurance to cover loss of revenue if they are forced to close temporarily, but those policies are also likely to exclude communicable diseases, an underwriter in London and insurance executives said.

"The Asian hospitality industry is an obvious example of an industry already affected. For many lines of business ... it is common market practice to have epidemic outbreak risk excluded," a Munich Re spokesman said.

While some firms including Munich Re have developed specific insurance products and policies for infectious diseases, not many firms have bought them, insurers said.

The impact on tourism and transport is also likely to hit supply chains in Asia, Narges Dorratoltaj, senior scientist at catastrophe risk modeling firm AIR, said.

Starbucks Corp on Tuesday [28 Jan 2020] became the 1st major US company to warn of a financial hit from the virus.

The Shanghai government announcement that all companies in the city would not be allowed to start work before 9 Feb [2020] will affect companies including Tesla Inc, General Motors, and Volkswagen.

While most travel insurers are likely to reimburse costs associated with trip cancellations and medical expenses for policies bought before the spread of the virus, some are excluding the coverage for select destinations now, industry officials said.

Insurers Aviva, Allianz, and AXA said individual policyholders would be covered if they are impacted by the virus, provided they follow travel advisories from governments.

Abstract
--------
Currently, a novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV causes an outbreak of viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China. Little is known about its epidemiological characteristics. Using the travel history and symptom onset of 34 confirmed cases that were detected outside Wuhan, we estimate the mean incubation period to be 5.8 (4.6-7.9, 95% CI) days, ranging from 1.3-11.3 days (2.5th to 97.5th percentile). These values help to inform case definitions for 2019-nCoV and appropriate durations for quarantine.

Our lab has been collecting data (freely available at https://github.com/HopkinsIDD/ncov_incubation/blob/master/data/nCoV-IDD-traveler-data.csv) on the exposure and symptom onset for Wuhan novel coronavirus (nCoV-2019) cases that have been confirmed outside of the Hubei province. These cases have been confirmed either in other countries or in regions of China with no known local transmission. We search for news articles and reports in both English and Chinese and abstract the data necessary to estimate the incubation period of nCoV-2019. Two team members independently review the full text of each case report to ensure that data is correctly input. Discrepancies are resolved by discussion and consensus.

Data summary
---------------
There are 101 cases from 38 countries and provinces outside of Hubei, China, that have been double-checked by our team. Of those, 34 are known to be female (34%) and 63 are male (62%). The median age is about 52 years (IQR: 36.5-59). 29 cases are from Mainland China (29%), while 72 are from the rest of the world (71%). 61 cases presented with a fever (60%).

The median incubation period lasts 5.174 days (CI: 4.46-6.037). The 2.5% of incubation periods pass in less than 2.542 days (CI: 1.829-3.564), while 97.5% of the population would experience symptoms by 10.531 days (CI: 7.381-15.051) since their exposure. The 'meanlog' and 'sdlog' estimates are the median and dispersion parameters for a LogNormal distribution; i.e., we recommend using a LogNormal (1.644, 0.363) distribution to appropriately represent the incubation time distribution.

[b] Neutralizing antibodies
Date: Wed 29 Jan 2020

https://tass.com/science/1114179


Scientists discover antibody that can neutralize 2019-nCoV coronavirus.

These viruses are closely related, and their RBD proteins are similar, which, the scientists presumed, allowed for a slight chance that these old molecules would also neutralize the new pathogen. On the one hand, those hopes were fulfilled with the CR3022, but the 4 other antibodies, including the synthetic cure m336, created several years ago in the Wuhan Institute of Virology, failed to react to the viral protein.

This discovery has greatly surprised the scientists, since computer models did not indicate that slight RBD differences would make the 2019-nCoV invulnerable to those protein molecules. The scientists now study the infected blood samples in hopes of finding other antibodies that would bind with the coronavirus more effectively than the CR3022 does.

[c] Vaccine

https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/y3mw37/scientists-have-already-developed-a-coronavirus-vaccine


As the number of patients infected with the new coronavirus in China passes the total number infected with SARS in 2003, scientists in Hong Kong revealed that they have already developed a vaccine. But the breakthrough is not going to help the thousands of people currently infected with the virus.

"We have already produced the vaccine, but it will take a long time to test," Yuen Kwok Yung, chair of infectious diseases at the University of Hong Kong, told the South China Morning Post, revealing that his team had isolated the previously unknown virus from the city's 1st imported case.

Yeun was unavailable to comment on the exact timeline for the vaccine on Wednesday [29 Jan 2020], but he said it would take months to test the vaccine on animals, and at least another year to conduct clinical trials on humans, before it was fit for use.

The race to produce a vaccine has intensified in recent days as the number of people infected has exploded. There are now over 6000 confirmed cases in China, a total surpassing the SARS infection rate in 2003 that killed 349 in the country. On Wednesday [29 Jan 2020], the last remaining uninfected region in China, Tibet, reported its 1st suspected case.

To date, the virus has killed 132 people in China. Globally the infection also continues to spread, with Turkey and the United Arab Emirates reporting their 1st cases on Wednesday [29 Jan 2020].

The researchers in Hong Kong are just one of more than half a dozen laboratories outside of China racing to develop vaccines for the deadly virus.

There are at least 4 labs in the US working on developing a vaccine. The National Institutes of Health in Maryland has been working on the issue for weeks, while scientists working for 3 private companies -- Johnson & Johnson, Moderna Therapeutics, and Inovio Pharmaceuticals -- are also seeking to develop vaccines.

In Australia, researchers have become the 1st to grow the virus in a lab outside of China, a breakthrough that the scientists said would be "a game-changer for diagnosis," as it will allow for the development of a test to confirm infections even in patients who are showing no symptoms.

"The virus will be used as positive control material for the Australian network of public health laboratories, and also shipped to expert laboratories working closely with the World Health Organization (WHO) in Europe," Julian Druce, from Melbourne's Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, said in a statement.

As scientists race to develop protections for the virus, governments around the world are taking steps to keep their citizens safe.
