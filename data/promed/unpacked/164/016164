Because this investigation is part of an ongoing damage assessment, I am
not at liberty to discuss specifics on individual animals being evaluated.
However, I may share that the animals had complete veterinary evaluations
including: physical exam(s), neurological evaluation, CBC(s), serum
chemistry(ies), fecal exam(s), gross and histopathological evaluation of
tissues, some bacteriologic cultures, and even cerebrospinal fluid
evaluation. In general, diseases of viral etiology were not considered to
be the likely cause of symptoms. However, these animals died a considerable
amount of time prior to our current concerned climate regarding
morbillivirus. Therefore, specific virus isolation was not done.
I believe that at least one veterinarian involved in the direct care of some
of these cases is a subscriber to this list, and she may be more free to
comment on the clinical presentation and evaluation of these cases than I am
at this point in time.
