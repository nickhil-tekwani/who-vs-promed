Outbreak of Bird Influenza Reported in North Korea: Source
----------------------------------------------------------
Thousands of chickens perished in North Korea about a month ago after
a suspected case of bird influenza hit the communist country for the
1st time, a source in Beijing said Tuesday [15 Mar 2005].

The informed source said the outbreak occurred at Hadang, the North's
main chicken factory in Pyongyang, prompting authorities there to
come up with emergency measures to stem the spread of the disease.

Bird flu hits North Korea plant
-------------------------------
Thousands of chickens in North Korea died from bird flu at a
processing plant last month, according to a report.

North Korea is believed to be preparing emergency measures following
the outbreak of avian influenza at the chicken plant in the North's
capital city of Pyongyang, an unnamed source familiar with North
Korea told South Korea's Yonhap news agency.

The facility is believed to be one of the biggest chicken factories
in North Korea, according to the source who spoke with North Korean
officials travelling in China. He added that it wasn't clear if that
was the only affected site.

The report did not say what test was performed to verify the presence
of bird flu or if the virus was the H5N1 strain, which has proven to
be deadly to humans.

South Korean officials weren't immediately available for comment.

North Korea's state media announced in 2004 that the country was
strengthening quarantine measures against bird flu following the
outbreak of the virus in Southeast Asian countries, but there haven't
been any previous reports of the virus in North Korea.

South Korean officials said yesterday that a South Korean trading
company had delayed plans to import 40 tons of poultry from North
Korea, but did not give a reason.

[Confirmation or otherwise will be appreciated. Korea (Dem. People's
Rep.) is a member-country of the World Organisation of Animal Health
(OIE), obliged to report suspected outbreaks of infectious animal
diseases such as avian influenza even prior to their final
confirmation.

South Korea was hit by a highly pathogenic H5N1 virus between
December 2003 and March 2004; the outbreak was successfully
eradicated by stamping out. On 21 Sep 2004, South Korea notified the
OIE that it considered itself free from HPAI in accordance with
article 2.7.12.2. of OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code, 6 months
after the eradication of the disease and following confirmatory
surveillance. (see <http://oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_26.HTM#Sec4>).

On 23 Dec 2004, a low pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5N2
was identified. In spite of the low pathogenicity, stamping out was
applied, leading to immediate eradication. The outbreak was duly
reported to the OIE. This, according to the new requirements of OIE's
Terrestrial Animal Health Code, which refers to a new definition,
namely NAI which stands for "Notifiable avian influenza" --
infection of poultry caused by any influenza A virus of the H5 or H7
subtypes or by any AI virus with an intravenous pathogenicity index
(IVPI) greater than 1.2. For more details pertaining to LPNAI and
HPNAI, see the commentary to posting 20041225.3414. - Mod.AS]
