Pistachio crop hit by fungus
----------------------------
Pistachio growers have recorded a fungus in their crops this season
[2011] that they've never seen in pistachios anywhere in the world.

Anthracnose is a disease commonly found in mangoes. But after a wet
and humid season in the major pistachio growing areas of South
Australia and Victoria, it has made its way into the nut crop.

Malcolm Otto, Nut Producers Australia, says growers have not known
how to defend their crops from the fungus and, as a result, have had a
horror season. "We were supposed to get a record intake this year
[2011] of roughly 2200 tonnes and we only got 1100 tonnes coming into
the factory," he said. "And out of that, 50 per cent was heavily
stained."

[The fungus _Glomerella cingulata_ and related species have been
reported to cause anthracnose-like symptoms on many crops.

On mango, anthracnose is considered the most important disease and is
also present in Australia (ProMED-mail post 20071110.3650). Symptoms
may include flower blight, pre- and post-harvest fruit rot, twig
dieback, and leaf spots. Ripe fruit can develop prominent black spots
resulting in extensive rotting. The fungi have a long saprophytic
survival ability on dead twigs and leaves. Spread occurs mainly with
infected plant material, by mechanical means (including insect
activities) and water splash. The disease is favoured by humid
conditions during the period from the onset of flowering until fruit
are about half size. Control of anthracnose in mango usually centers
on a diligent fungicide programme, but may also include
phytosanitation to reduce inoculum and cultural measures to reduce
moisture in the orchard.

The report above suggests that this may be the 1st time anthracnose
has been observed in pistachio and that if may have originated from
mangoes. While pistachio and mango both belong to the family
Anacardiaceae, mango is a tropical crop of northern Australia and does
not grow in the pistachio cultivating regions mentioned above. It is
therefore more likely that the disease in pistachio has originated
from another plant source closer to the pistachio groves. Different
anthracnose strains have been reported to vary in their levels of host
specificity (see links below on cross infection potential of strains),
and further work appears to be required to determine a likely source
for the new disease in pistachio. The emergence of a new strain
adapted to pistachio can also not be excluded.
