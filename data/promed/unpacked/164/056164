A comment on tickborne encephalitis vaccines
--------------------------------------------
[Dr Gerald Eder has provided the following information in response to the
moderator's query about the efficacy of current vaccines (derived from
European strains) with respect to the other subtypes/strains of tickborne
encephalitis virus: see "Tick-borne encephalitis - Russia (Krasnoyarsk)
(02) 20040516.1318 ". - Mod.CP]

Concerning the efficacy of the "European" vaccine against tickborne
encephalitis virus (TBEV), an excellent review was published in 2001 -- in
English, by Takashima and co-workers (Jpn J Infect Dis 2001; 54: 1-11). In
this review, they clearly demonstrated that the strain of TBEV found in
Japan (Hokkaido) emerged from the Far Eastern Russian strain a few hundred
years ago. This finding explained why the virulence of these strains was
similar to that of the TBEV strain isolated in Russia. The Japanese strain
was sequenced, and vaccination trials in Japanese volunteers showed no
difference in the neutralization test using different antigens.

In my lecture titled "TBE: Virology and Active Immunization" (given during
the 7th Conference of the International Society of Travel Medicine's
Congress in Innsbruck, Austria (May 27-31, 2001)), I showed a slide
demonstrating the correlation of neutralizing antibodies between different
strains. The Spearman rank correlation was between 0.6 and 0.76, comparing
the neutralizing antibodies against 3 different strains, namely, NDF #
04/94, which is the strain used for one of the European vaccines (FSME
Immun produced by Baxter), 12 Loop.ill and N 132 2BMP.

The other vaccine available in Europe against TBEV infection -- Encepur,
produced by Chiron -- should have the same efficacy against the Russian and
Far Eastern strain as the above-mentioned vaccine. Encepur is used in
Germany, in former Eastern countries (now new members of the EU), and in
Austria. Patients can be immunized, or boostered, with one or the other
vaccine. The difference of the products is found in the frequency of
adverse side effects only.
