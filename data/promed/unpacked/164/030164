[The summary above includes a map showing all outbreaks reported since the initial diagnosis of this unusual event. The 1st samples had been collected about a year earlier. Fortunately, so far this epizootic seems rather restricted to wildlife (Chinese ferret-badgers), with minimal human exposure, while mass vaccinations of susceptible domestic animals are meant to prevent spill-over.

Follow-up report 37 addressed a total of 18 new outbreaks (19 cases), all in ferret-badgers. For details and an interactive map, see http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=14289.
