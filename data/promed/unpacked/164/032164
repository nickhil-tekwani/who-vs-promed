The Florida Department of Health, Bureau of Epidemiology is investigating a
cluster of multi-drug resistant _Salmonella senftenberg_ cases. Especially
remarkable is the resistance of these isolates to fluoroquinolones.
Isolates have been identified from three hospitalized patients and a
non-hospitalized patient from sputum, stool and urine. We would be
interested in hearing from persons who have encountered similar
cases.
