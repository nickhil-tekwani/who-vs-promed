The HSE [Ireland's national health service] says it "had not seen diseases like measles in Donegal, Sligo or Leitrim for a number of years, because 95% of children were vaccinated against them. Last year [2018], the uptake of childhood vaccinations dropped slightly in Donegal, and this resulted in an outbreak of measles in January this year [2019]."

The HSE says "There is also an ongoing mumps outbreak across Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim. The HSE has been notified of 116 cases so far.

"As soon as vaccination rates fall, diseases like measles and mumps return. Fortunately, the majority of people in Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim are protecting their children with vaccination. The most recent figures for 2018 show that 90% of children in Donegal received the MMR and 93% of children in Sligo and Leitrim received it.

"However, over 95% of children need to be vaccinated with the MMR in order to prevent the spread of measles in our community. This is the goal for 2019, as it is really important for 'herd immunity'. In this way, we can protect newborns and vulnerable children, including those with cancer or immune problems who can't get vaccinated, from coming in contact with measles and other diseases like meningitis."

This year [2019] European Immunisation Week runs 24-30 Apr. The goal is to raise awareness of the benefits of vaccination and to celebrate the vaccine heroes who contribute to protecting lives through vaccination. Vaccine heroes include health workers who administer vaccines, parents who choose vaccination for their children, and everyone who promotes vaccination.

"Every parent wants to protect their child and do what's right for them. Sometimes it can be difficult to know what to do, now that there is so much false and misleading information on the internet and social media when it comes to vaccination," says Dr. Laura Heavey, Specialist Registrar in Public Health Medicine in HSE North West, "I would really encourage parents to look for information in the right places. Two good sources of reliable, evidence-based information are <www.immunisation.ie> and the Vaccine Knowledge Project at http://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/. Essentially all of the vaccines on the infant, child and adolescent schedule in Ireland are backed up with years of data on their safety."

Another goal for the HSE in 2019 is to continue to increase the uptake of the HPV vaccine in teenagers. In 2018, 70% of teenage girls in Ireland got the vaccine. In Scotland, where HPV vaccination started over 10 years ago and 90% of teenage girls get the HPV vaccine, researchers have found that the vaccine has nearly wiped out cases of cervical pre-cancer in young women. We want to see as many Irish teenagers as possible getting vaccinated in 2019, so that we can see those same results here. This year [2019], the vaccine will also be offered to teenage boys. If all our young people receive the vaccine, cervical cancer could be eliminated in Ireland in the future.

Indiana University officials say the number of students diagnosed with mumps has more than doubled since last week to 16. University spokesman Chuck Carney said Wednesday [17 Apr 2019] that 9 of the cases are linked to a single fraternity he declined to identify.

Carney says university officials have been in contact with the Indiana State Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The new total compares with 7 cases announced last week. The first 2 cases were confirmed in February [2019], and a campus outbreak of the illness was declared last month [March 2019] after a 3rd case was confirmed.

Free vaccines are available for anyone who has had close contact with infected students. Mumps is a viral illness that affects glands that produce saliva.

[2b] Indiana University outbreak confirmation
Date: Thu 18 Apr 2019
Source: People.com [edited]
https://people.com/health/17-cases-mumps-indiana-university-fraternity/


More than a dozen cases of mumps have been reported at Indiana University [IU] this year [2019], and the majority have been linked to one of the school's fraternities. IU spokesman Chuck Carney says there have been 17 confirmed mumps cases on campus since 12 Feb 2019, of which 9 have been linked to a single fraternity house.

While the school is not identifying the students or the fraternity, CNN reported that those affected by the outbreak were either members of the fraternity or had visited the house.

Carney went on to say that every student enrolled at IU is required to have 2 doses of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine -- the amount recommended by the CDC -- with an exemption available for religious reasons.

On 4 Apr 2019, the Monroe County Health Department held a free MMR vaccination clinic at the fraternity house, which allowed members to get a 3rd shot "which provides about a month of boosted immunity." Of the 149 members of the fraternity, 58% got a vaccine.

The school is also taking steps to promote healthy practices in general. "We're making the campus aware and advising students to say home if they feel sick and otherwise practice good hygiene habits -- wash their hands with soap and water, don't drink or eat after someone, cover a sneeze with a tissue, for example," Carney said. "We want all of our 41 000-plus students to remain healthy, so they should go to the IU Health Center on the IU Bloomington campus and get checked out if they feel unwell or see their own doctor."

According to the Mayo Clinic, mumps is "a viral infection that primarily affects saliva-producing (salivary) glands that are located near your ears." Signs and symptoms of the virus typically develop between 2 to 3 weeks after exposure.

In addition to painful gland swelling, mumps can also cause fever, headache, muscle aches, fatigue and loss of appetite. However, in rare cases, the contagious disease has been known to cause brain and spinal cord damage as well as death, according to the CDC. The virus is transmitted through saliva or mucus, and can be spread by sharing cups and utensils, or participating in close-contact activities, like sports or kissing, the CDC says.

Both mumps and measles can be prevented with the MMR vaccine, but measles cases are on the rise worldwide. The World Health Organization said in a report released on Monday [15 Apr 2019] that based on preliminary data, measles cases are up by 300% worldwide in the first 3 months of 2019, compared with the same period last year [2018], adding that the new data "indicate a clear trend" of rising rates of infection.

Earlier this year [2019], the organization named "vaccine hesitancy" -- the "reluctance or refusal to vaccinate despite the availability" -- as one of the biggest threats to global health in 2019. Thanks to the measles vaccine, 2 to 3 million deaths are prevented each year, WHO said, but that number could be much higher. "A further 1.5 million could be avoided if global coverage of vaccinations improved," the group said.

Cases of the measles in the USA are now at a 5-year high. As of 11 Apr, there have been a reported 555 measles cases in 2019, according to the CDC, the most since 2014.

The CDC says that there are currently outbreaks of the measles in several parts of the USA, including the Pacific Northwest, Michigan and New York City. They believe the outbreaks are due to people traveling to other countries with significant outbreaks, including Israel, the Philippines and Ukraine, and then coming back to the USA and infecting people in areas with low vaccination rates.

Although the measles was considered eradicated in the USA as of 2000 thanks to the vaccine, some people are choosing to not vaccinate, partially due to the spread of misinformation about the vaccine, which has led parents to opt out of giving children the life-saving protections.

[3] Penn State University outbreak
Date: Wed 17 Apr 2019

Another case of the mumps has been confirmed at Penn State. This comes just a week after the university announced the 1st cases, during the spring semester. The university says this latest case is now the 3rd confirmed case of the mumps at the University Park campus, and the state's Department of Health considers this a mumps outbreak.

"We're encouraging people that may have children or may not be immune to mumps to really be careful if they're coming to campus," infectious disease manager and campus health liaison Shelley Haffner said. Haffner is giving a warning to those who might visit the University Park campus as it faces another mumps outbreak.

Health officials say mumps is a highly contagious disease that can be passed through saliva. Penn State also dealt with mumps outbreaks in spring 2017 and spring 2018.

The first 2 cases were confirmed last week. That led the university to put out a warning for folks before Blue-White Weekend activities begin, bringing big crowds. The university says it has 3 more suspected cases. "We want to stress the importance of understanding possible is: They could end up being something other than mumps," Haffner said.

In order to protect students, the university says one student has left campus and the others have been isolated until further notice.

If any students have come in contact with those infected, the university advises them to get a 3rd dose of the measles, mumps and rubella -- MMR -- vaccine. Students are required to be vaccinated. Those who don't have proof of the MMR vaccine may be excluded from campus. "That means they cannot come to classes on campus, or live on campus," Haffner said.

Health center officials say they're working closely with the Department of Health to monitor the situation. "As I said, we only have 3 confirmed cases at this point so we're just going to have to wait and see if more cases develop," Haffner said.

University officials say there is a concern when it comes to big crowds. Graduation is approaching but, if the number of cases doesn't increase, the situation will calm down.

Students and faculty who haven't received the MMR vaccine (for measles, mumps and rubella) will be "excluded" from school and school activities while health officials investigate a possible mumps outbreak. At least 2 Sanpete County residents have contracted mumps, the Central Utah Public Health Department announced in a press release Monday [15 Apr 2019]. The health department stated it was investigating "other probable cases with close contact to the identified cases."

Unvaccinated individuals will be allowed to return to school 26 days from the onset of the last identified case, the department stated. Currently, that date would be 5 May 2019. Those individuals will have to provide documentation of their receipt of the MMR vaccine before they can return. No further information about the mumps-infected individuals would be released, the health department stated.

Mumps is contagious and caused by a virus, the department stated. Signs and symptoms of mumps include fever, headache, muscle aches, and swelling of the salivary glands, causing a tender and swollen jaw. Complications of mumps can include swelling of the brain, meningitis, and deafness.

The department provided some guidelines to reduce the risk of getting mumps, including:
- Stay current on recommended vaccines; the MMR vaccine is the best way to reduce the likeliness of getting mumps. Know the vaccination status of yourself and any family members. A person is considered susceptible unless they have received 2 doses of the mumps vaccine or were born prior to 1957.
- Contact your healthcare provider if you see signs of mumps in yourself or a family member. Do not go directly to a clinic or hospital without calling before. This will help to ensure that others are not exposed.

[Mumps is a viral illness caused by a paramyxovirus. Transmission is by direct contact with saliva or droplets from the saliva of an infected person.

Early symptoms include a headache and fever characterised by swelling of the parotid glands that may be 1- or 2-sided. Other symptoms include pancreatitis, neuritis, arthritis, mastitis, nephritis, thyroiditis and pericarditis. Mumps is rarely fatal, but complications include swelling of the ovaries (oophoritis), swelling of the testes (orchitis), aseptic meningitis and deafness (https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/mumps-guidance-data-and-analysis).

Mumps is a notifiable disease in England and Wales, Ireland, and the USA.

Mumps is vaccine-preventable. In the UK, children receive 2 doses of the combined measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine as part of the routine childhood immunisation schedule. - Mod.UBA]
