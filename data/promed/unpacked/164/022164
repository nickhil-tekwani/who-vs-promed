Investigations into the source of a hepatitis A outbreak in
Christchurch have revealed that a child-care centre is the common
link. Medical Officer of Health, Mel Brieseman, says there have now
been 21 notifications of the disease -- 8 of which have a direct
association with the ABC Centre in Ferrymead.
Dr Brieseman says the disease was probably introduced from outside
the Centre, by someone returning from overseas. He says the danger at
the Childcare Centre is likely to be past -- but the disease has a
long incubation period. Dr Brieseman says health staff will meet the
Child-care Centre workers and parents to offer advice and
immunisation -- and there is no need for the Centre to be closed.
Centre manager Cindy Paul says no children have been withdrawn from
the Centre at this stage.

A Ferrymead Child-care Centre is the source of the hepatitis A
outbreak that has infected 21 people in Christchurch since [December
2005]. Public health officials said yesterday that all notified cases
of the viral liver disease involved families with children at the ABC
Learning Centre in Ferrymead or people who had been to parties with
the Centre's children.
Canterbury medical officer of health Mel Brieseman said the Centre
would not be closed. "Most of the exposure has already occurred, so
closure would not achieve anything."
He said it was likely the disease was introduced from outside,
probably from a child returning from overseas during the incubation
period. It was then spread by contact with faeces to other children
at the Centre and to others at birthday and Christmas parties. A
child's birthday party was yesterday cancelled on the advice of
health officials.
4 new cases were confirmed yesterday, and another 3 previously
notified cases dating from December 2005 were linked to the outbreak,
taking the total to 21. Most sufferers were adults, including 2 who
had been admitted to hospital and since discharged. Brieseman said
several people remained "quite unwell" with the disease, a moderate
to severe illness that in rare cases could kill. Unlike other forms
of hepatitis, sufferers usually made a full recovery without
long-term symptoms.
ABC manager Cindy Paul said she was disappointed by the outbreak, as
staff had strict hygiene training. She was reassured the spread of
the disease was not entirely due to a breakdown in its systems. "We
have really strict health and hygiene policies, so for us it has been
very disappointing."
Brieseman said public health officials would meet parents and staff
next week. Immunisation would be offered, although its value was
uncertain at this late stage. "It is nonetheless worth considering
because of the possibility of others incubating the disease," he
said. He warned that further cases were likely because the disease
was "extremely contagious", particularly in the 2 weeks before
jaundice developed. Brieseman said hepatitis A was spread through
faeces, so washing hands thoroughly after using the toilet was crucial.
A 42-year-old Christchurch mother, whose son is at the Ferrymead
centre, spent 7 days in hospital with jaundice. She had felt unwell
for much of December 2005, finally being admitted to hospital on Mon
2 Jan 2006 while on holiday. She was discharged on Monday, but
remained too unwell to drive or return to work. Her son had been
confirmed as hepatitis-positive but had not suffered any serious illness.
Notices at the Centre on Thu 12 Jan 2006 announced there had been a
case of hepatitis A, and she was phoned yesterday to be told about
the case and that more information would arrive in the post next
week. However, Centre staff did not explain the extent of the
outbreak, she said. "It would have been nice to be given more
information. They didn't tell us to get immunised or get a blood test
or anything like that."
Brieseman said the previous hepatitis A outbreak in Canterbury was in
2000 and associated with a men's club in Christchurch. "It was quite
a different issue." A 2002 North Island outbreak was linked to
contaminated blueberries.

[Hepatitis A is an enterically transmitted viral disease of the
liver. Following exposure, an incubation period of 15 to 45 days
precedes the development of clinical symptoms. Symptoms include
general malaise, fever, nausea and jaundice. It is usually
transmitted through contact with the faeces of infected people, or by
environmental contamination. Unlike hepatitis B and C, it does not
cause chronic liver disease. Most patients recover completely within
6-10 weeks. Close contacts of sufferers may be offered an injection
of antibodies for temporary protection. Immunisation may also be
offered for long-term protection. - Mod.CP]
[Day care centers have been identified as significant "players" in
the epidemiology of hepatitis A outbreaks. The pre-school age
children often have non-icteric (no jaundice) non-specific viral
syndrome symptoms so that hepatitis A is not considered as an
etiology until their parents and/or caretakers present with jaundice
and other more typical symptoms associated with hepatitis A.
