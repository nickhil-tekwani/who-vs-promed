Sainsbury's is recalling all of its own-brand watercress due to an _E. coli_ outbreak that has made 18 people ill. 13 of those affected are from England, with 4 in Wales and 1 in Scotland. Some of the victims are being treated in hospital. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) said the supermarket giant was also recalling salads containing watercress. It said the move was a precautionary measure due to a possible association with an outbreak of _E. coli_ O157. No other Sainsbury's supermarket products are known to be affected.

The FSA said: "(Sainsbury's) is advising people not to consume any of these products and to return them to the store they were purchased from for a full refund.

"Investigations by the Food Standards Agency, Public Health England and local authorities are continuing, and further information will be provided once it becomes available. Sainsbury's has informed the FSA that it is carrying out testing on all of its affected lines, but that no trace of _E. coli_ O157 has been detected to date."

Public Health England said the outbreak was mainly affecting people over the age of 50 and interviews with those affected "revealed a strong link to the consumption of watercress", with most saying they had bought it at Sainsbury's.

[Whether grown in water or on land, produce eaten without cooking transmit enteric pathogens which contaminate them during growing or after harvest.

Watercress (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watercress), _Nasturtium officinale_, is a fast-growing, aquatic or semi-aquatic, perennial plant native to Europe and Asia, and one of the oldest known leaf vegetables consumed by humans. It is a member of the family _Brassicaceae_, botanically related to garden cress, mustard and radish -- all noteworthy for a peppery, tangy flavor.

The common liver fluke, _Fasciola hepatica_, is transmitted to man when metacercariae, encysted on aquatic vegetation such as watercress is eaten or when water containing metacercariae is drunk. Human infections occur in parts of Europe, northern Africa, Cuba, South America, and other locales. - Mod.LL
