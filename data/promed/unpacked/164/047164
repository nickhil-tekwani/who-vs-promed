Health and Development Ministry Epidemiology Director Jose Rafael Mendoza
said there has been an increase in the number of cases since June, but that
"we have been entering a nationwide epidemic phase of dengue fever and
malaria" for 3 weeks, the Caracas media reported Tuesday.
The official said the nationwide alert declared by health authorities on 27
Dec 1999 will remain in place for several months given the situation.
Mendoza said that dengue fever, a disease transmitted by the mosquito
species _Aedes aegypti_ that may lead to death in hemorrhagic cases, is
mainly found in the western states of Zulia and Falcon.
A total of 545 dengue fever cases have been reported in Zulia over the last
three weeks and 292 cases in Falcon.
