Rabies death in Northern Ireland sparks Health Protection Agency investigation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Health Protection Agency [HPA] has launched an investigation following
the death of a young woman from rabies in Northern Ireland last week [5-9
Jan 2009]. Officials from the agency are attempting to trace volunteers who
have worked at the Riverside Wildlife Rehabilitation and Environmental
Education Centre in Limpopo, South Africa.

The woman, who died last week, is thought to have acquired rabies following
a bite from a dog while working at the animal sanctuary in December 2006.
The centre has written to all those who volunteered there since July 2006
as a precaution and it is estimated that around 230 UK citizens have worked
there since that date. Volunteers are being advised that if they have been
bitten or scratched by a dog or mongoose within the centre or surrounding
area, they should seek medical advice.

Rabies vaccine is extremely effective at preventing the disease even if it
is given some time after an exposure. Dr David Brown, HPA rabies expert,
said: 'This is a tragic event and is a very real example of the need to get
health advice before you travel to countries where rabies is common or if
you know you will be working with animals. "Talk to your doctor or nurse
about whether or not a rabies vaccine is appropriate."

Follow-up related to the human rabies case in Northern Ireland
--------------------------------------------------------------
The Health Protection Agency is working with colleagues in South Africa and
Northern Ireland to trace volunteers who have worked at the Riverside
Wildlife Rehabilitation and Environmental Education Centre in Limpopo
province, South Africa. This follows the recent death from imported rabies
of a young woman in Northern Ireland who had worked at the Centre in
December 2006 [1].

The woman is thought to have acquired rabies following a bite from a dog
whilst working at the animal sanctuary. As a precautionary measure, a
letter has been sent by the Centre to all those who have volunteered there
since July 2006. This includes approximately 220 UK citizens, some of whom
made multiple visits.

Volunteers are being advised that if they have been bitten, scratched or
licked on the face or on an open wound, by a dog or mongoose, within the
Centre or in the surrounding area, they should seek medical advice from a
health professional to determine whether they require preventive treatment
with rabies vaccine.

Pre-exposure prophylaxis is highly effective at preventing rabies
infection. Travellers to rabies endemic countries should seek travel health
advice well in advance of their departure (ideally 4-6 weeks before)
regarding their need for pre-exposure immunisation against rabies,
particularly if they are planning on working with animals.

Following a bite, scratch or lick by a warm blooded animal in a rabies
endemic country, the wound or site of exposure (eg mucous membrane) should
be washed with plenty of soap and water and medical advice sought without
delay, even for those who have been vaccinated. If medical advice is not
received whilst abroad, this should still be sought on return to the UK,
even if this is some time after the event. Following exposure, an
individual risk assessment should be undertaken to determine the need for
post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with rabies vaccine and/or immunoglobulin.
PEP is highly effective in preventing rabies and most effective when given
promptly. There have been no cases of rabies in the UK in people who have
received PEP for rabies.
