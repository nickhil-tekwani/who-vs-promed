A new pneumonic plague case has been confirmed in Ulanqab, northern China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, after a herdsman was diagnosed on Wed 27 Nov 2019. The city is over 500 km [about 311 mi] away from Xilingol League in the region, where the other 3 pneumonic plague cases were previously found.

The patient, who had visited a region where plague sources were identified, was being treated in isolation and was in a stable condition at the Siziwang Banner People's Hospital in Ulanqab, according to the hospital on Thu 28 Nov 2019. Four people who had close contact with the patient have been isolated for medical observation as required. None of them have shown symptoms such as fever at present.

Siziwang Banner has completed comprehensive disinfection and sterilization of the patient's house and the surrounding pastoralists' dwellings. Local authorities are implementing rodent and flea control and publicity work. After the plague cases, the health department in Inner Mongolia has carried out investigations and rodent extermination.

[Previous posts reported that only 2 of the recent cases were pneumonic. This post appears to report the 3rd Inner Mongolia case of pneumonic plague. The epidemiology of this case is not stated.

The bacterium that causes plague is _Yersinia pestis_. Most cases of plague are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a "bubo". Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being bitten. At this point in the illness, there is no risk of person-to-person spread, so if this was indeed a case of bubonic plague, no isolation or quarantine is necessary.

When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antimicrobial therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. At this stage, as appears to have happened in this case, person-to-person spread can occur, causing other cases of "primary" plague pneumonia. - Mod.LL
