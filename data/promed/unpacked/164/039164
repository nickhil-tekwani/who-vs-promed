PINE TREE FUNGUS - GERMANY, SWITZERLAND
=======================================
Source: EPPO Reporting Service 1995, No.11, reports 95/238-240
--------------------------------------------------------------
Mycosphaerella dearnessii is a fungus that appears to be of American origin.
In the southern USA it causes severe growth reduction or death of seedlings
of Pinus palustris, and can reduce pulpwood yields up to 60%. In the
nothern USA it defoliates P.sylvestris, ruining them for the
Christmas tree market.
The first confirmed report from Europe was in 1978 (although it has been
claimed it arrived earlier). It has now been found in Switzerland in June
1995 on Pinus mugo & P.uncinata in a cemetery near Zurich, but not on
adjacent P.sylvestris. Control measures were taken. It was also found on
P.mugo in southern Germany, and could be widespread in Europe now, but
remain latent under certain conditions.
