[Osh province is in the south west part of Kyrgyzstan; see http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/commonwealth/kyrgyzstan_physio-2005.jpg. To find Uchar, go to http://www.fallingrain.com/world/KG/08/Uchar.html. It is south of Osh and close to the Uzbekistan border and the Ferganna valley.

This report mentions other animals being bitten but provides no other information. While the 4 humans exposed have been properly treated for their exposure, one can only hope that the exposed animals were also vaccinated. Otherwise, they will succumb and thereby expose more humans. - Mod.MHJ
