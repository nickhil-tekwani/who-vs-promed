A new outbreak of _Salmonella_ infections has been registered in central
Lithuania.
Twenty-four pupils at a Radviliskis orphanage and six staff members were
hospitalized at the Radviliskis Central Hospital with digestive tract
disorders. A diagnosis of _Salmonella_ infection has been made for seven
patients, the Infectious Disease Prophylactics and Control Center reports.
It is suspected that the infections resulted from food prepared in the
cafeteria of the orphanage. The cafeteria has been closed down.
This is the second outbreak of salmonella in Lithuania recently. Last week,
at least 80 residents of Western Lithuania fell ill with _Salmonella_ after
eating glazed rolls with filling.
_Salmonella_ usually affects patients who have eaten spoiled eggs or egg
products, freshly butchered meat or, most frequently, chicken.
