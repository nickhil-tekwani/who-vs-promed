*********************************************

This obviously does not have a significant public health relevance, but,
however sad, it is interesting and curious.
In the last edition of the Revista da Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina
Tropical (Jaime-Andrade G., J et al, 1997 - Acute Chagas' cardiopathy in
a polar bear (Ursus maritimus) in Guadalajara, Mexico. Rev. Soc. Bras.
Med. Trop. 30(4):337-340) a case-report (in English) describes a fatal
case of acute Chagas' cardiopathy in a captive 24 year old female polar
bear in the Guadalajara (Jalisco, Mexico) zoo.
There is histological and parasitological demonstration, and infected
Triatoma longipennis were collected within 5 meters of the zoo den where
the bear lived.
