An increase in the incidence of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome
(HFRS) has been observed in Tatarstan.

The regional Rospotrebnadzor [Federal Agency for Human Health and
Welfare] has reported that 11 cases of HFRS were recorded between 29
Jul and 6 Aug 2010, which represents 30 percent of all cases this
year [2010]. Of these 11 cases, 6 people contracted HFRS infection in
woodlands, one in the vicinity of a lake, one in a village, and one
in a cultivated area outside a settlement.

Zoologists from a regional institution conducting surveillance
activities in woodland areas are forecasting an increase in the
rodent population throughout Tatarstan.

[Although not specifically stated, it is likely that Pummala virus is
the specific hantavirus responsible for this outbreak of HFRS in
Tatarstan, and the rodent reservoir is the bank vole (_Myodes glareolus_).

The Republic of Tatarstan is located in the east-central part of
European Russia. The Republic lies in the middle Volga River basin
around the confluence of the Volga and Kama rivers. The landscape is
that of a low, rolling plain. Kazan is the capital.
