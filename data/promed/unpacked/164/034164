Tomato golden mosaic begomovirus came to our attention as causing an
emerging disease of tomato in the Americas. The disease was first reported
in Brazil in 1975, and more recently in Costa Rica (Rosset et al., 1990).
Where: Brazil, Costa Rica.
On which plants: Tomato (_Lycopersicon esculentum_).
Damage: Stunting and severely deformed young leaves and shoots, bright
yellow mosaic. The disease was first reported in Brazil in 1975, but did
not cause significant losses. However, since 1994, a sharp increase of
symptoms has been observed on tomato in several areas occurring
simultaneously with the appearance of the B biotype of _Bemisia tabaci_.
Several begomoviruses were found including bean golden mosaic, tomato
golden mosaic and tomato yellow vein streak begomoviruses. Damage caused by
begomoviruses of tomato are reported to be severe in Brazil (Ribeiro et
al., 1998; SBV Web site).
Transmission: Transmitted by _Bemisia tabaci_.
Note: It is not clear whether tomato yellow mosaic in Venezuela and tomato
golden mosaic in Brazil are caused by distinct begomoviruses.
Pathway: Infected tomato plants, fruits?, viruliferous _B. tabaci_ from
countries where tomato golden mosaic begomovirus occurs.
Possible risks: Tomato is an important crop in the EPPO region, both indoor
and outdoor, and insect vector is present in many parts of the EPPO region.
Data is also lacking on the relationships of this virus with other
begomoviruses of tomato present in Brazil, such as tomato golden mosaic, as
well data on severity and extent of the disease in Brazil.
