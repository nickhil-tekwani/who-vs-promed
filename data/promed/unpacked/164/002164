[A total of 40 deaths have been reported among the 127 infected healthcare workers. That is a 31.5% case fatality rate (CFR) -- half the community CFR -- possibly because more healthcare workers who get infected are vaccinated, which provides protection, or they receive care earlier in the infectious process. It is not stated why this most recent healthcare worker was not vaccinated, whether it was unavailable to him/her or refused when offered. - Mod.LK]

3. The story in this note from this week's #Ebola situation report from @WHOAFRO is a good illustration of how this outbreak keeps spreading into new territory. A case from Beni went 460 km (nearly 300 miles) to an area where Ebola wasn't spreading -- & near South Sudan.]

Highlights of the week
-----------------------
- A suspected Ebola virus disease (EVD) alert was reported in Yei on 25 Jun 2019. The alert was verified and discarded by the rapid response team given that it did not meet the EVD case definition.
- 75 349 screenings were conducted for EVD in 31 points of entry. Since August [2018], the cumulative number of screenings conducted for EVD is 2 391 408.
- The glove box for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) machine has been installed and tested. An expert is in the country to mentor the National Public Health Laboratory (NPHL) personnel on procedure of sample testing and quality control for the period of 2 weeks.

Ebola situation update from North Kivu of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
----------------------------------
- As of 27 Jun 2019, a total of 2297confirmed cases and 1553 deaths (case fatality ratio of 67.6%) has been reported.
- Some 116 new cases and 94 deaths were reported over the period of 18 to 27 Jun 2019, indicating that the outbreak is not under control.
- Figure 1 [at the source URL] shows the Epi-curve of new EVD cases in DRC. Although the recent trend in the number of new cases each week is decreasing, this should be interpreted with caution given the high number of unknown contacts within the community.
- An Ebola case is confirmed in Ariwara town of Aru territory, Ituri province; about 70 km (43.5 mi) from the South border.

Ebola situation update from Uganda
-----------------------------
- As of 30 Jun 2019, a total of 3 confirmed cases with 100% fatality rate.
- As of 30 Jun 2019, there are 93 contacts under follow up with none developing signs and symptoms suggestive of EVD.
- Cumulatively, 1437 individuals have been vaccinated: 78 contacts, 747 contacts of contacts and 612 frontline health workers.
- Active case search and death surveillance ongoing in health facilities and communities as the district response team investigates all alerts.

http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/07/ebola-case-identified-near-south-sudan-border
[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

An Ebola case-patient has been identified just 70 km (43 mi) from the Democratic Republic of the Congo's (DRC) border with South Sudan, the Associate Press (AP) reported today [2 Jul 2019]. [See MoH report above.]

Last month [June 2019], a 5-year-old boy found in Uganda became the 1st international case of Ebola in this 11-month-long outbreak that has otherwise stayed confined to the DRC's North Kivu and Ituri provinces. Uganda had in place for months an extensive surveillance and response protocol for Ebola border crossings, but officials in South Sudan told the AP they were not as prepared for the virus.

Today [2 Jul 2019] the DRC health ministry confirmed another 16 new cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD), raising outbreak totals to 2354. Officials also confirmed 15 new case deaths, raising the fatality total to 1586. A total of 402 suspected cases are under investigation.

Yesterday [1 Jul 2019] marked the 1st time a case has been confirmed in Ariwara health zone, which is located in Ituri province. The Ariwara patient is a mother of 5 sickened children who traveled to Ariwara from Beni to hide from surveillance teams. Today [2 Jul 2019] the DRC confirmed she had died from the virus.

"To date, 177 family contacts have been listed in Ariwara and 40 contacts have already been vaccinated," the DRC said yesterday [1 Jul 2019]. Today [2 Jul 2019] the DRC said an unvaccinated health worker in Beni is among the newly confirmed cases. This lifts the total number of healthcare workers infected to 127, including 40 deaths. Health workers represent 5% of cases in this outbreak.

"New EVD cases continue to occur in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, with continued fluctuating transmission intensity, reducing in previous hotspots, but increasing in areas with previously relatively low transmission rates," the World Health Organization's (WHO's) African regional office said yesterday [1 Jul 2019] in a weekly bulletin on the outbreak.

In the past 21 days, Mabalako, Beni and Mandima have been the main hotspots, with 33%, 24%, and 9% of newly confirmed cases. Transmission in these towns outpaces transmission in Katwa and Butembo, the main hotspots for the 1st half of 2019.

The WHO's regional office also highlighted the number of investigations currently undertaken in the DRC, including more than 16 000 case contacts followed up daily, and more than 1500 alerts assessed in the past week, resulting in 309 suspected cases.

- Mon 1 Jul 2019. Virus spread, increased violence
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/07/ebola-outbreak-reaches-2338-cases-among-violence-ituri
[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

Over the weekend and through today [1 Jul 2019], the Democratic Republic of the Congo's (DRC) ministry of health recorded 41 more cases of the deadly disease, including another case detected in a vaccinated health worker.

The continued spread of the outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces has been marked in recent days by increased cases in Beni, Mabalako, and Masereka. These are the towns and villages where the outbreak began 11 months ago. The health worker who was infected is the outbreak's 126th and was also from Mabalako.

Late last week, the United Nations (UN) voiced concerns about ongoing massacres and ethnic violence in the DRC's Ituri province, according to UN News.

At least 94 people were killed in Djugu territory and 23 in Mahagi territory, including an as-yet undetermined number of women and children, officials said. The violence could influence the Ebola outbreak, as it may prompt more migration into neighboring countries such as Uganda, which a few weeks ago confirmed its 1st cases linked to the outbreak, in a family traveling from the DRC.

The UN also said the disease was moving into small, forest-based villages such as Alima, where access is "more challenging."

According to the latest updates to the World Health Organization's (WHO's) Ebola dashboard, the DRC will likely confirm 13 more cases of the viral disease today [1 Jul 2019], raising outbreak totals to 2338 cases. As of yesterday [30 Jun 2019], 1563 people had died in the outbreak, and 309 suspected cases are under investigation.

Late last week, Oly Ilunga Kalenga, MD, the minister of health in the DRC, held a meeting in Kinshasa to review experimental Ebola vaccine candidates.

Situation update
--------------
The outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo continues this past week, with a steady and sustained transmission intensity.

Indicators over the past few weeks demonstrated early signs of transmission easing in intensity in some major hotspots such as Butembo and Katwa. However, concerns remain over the current hotspots in the health zones of Beni, Mabalako, and Mandima; the concurrent increase in the number of new cases occurring in areas that previously had lower rates of transmission, such as the Komanda, Lubero, and Rwampara/Bunia health zones; and cases exported from hotspot areas into unaffected health zones. On 30 Jun 2019, a case who had travelled from Beni was confirmed in Ariwara Health Zone, more than 460 km (286 mi) north of Beni, towards the borders with Uganda and South Sudan.

Overall, EVD case incidence rates remained largely unchanged in the past week (Figure 1 at source URL). In the 21 days between 10 and 30 Jun 2019, 67 health areas within 20 health zones reported new cases, representing 10% of the 664 health areas within North Kivu and Ituri provinces (see Table 1 and Figure 2 at source URL). During this period, a total of 276 confirmed cases were reported, the majority of which were from the health zones of Mabalako, Beni and Mandima -- the main active areas in the outbreak, with 32% (n = 89), 24% (n = 66) and 9% (n = 22), respectively. As of 30 Jun 2019, a total of 2338 EVD cases, including 2244 confirmed and 94 probable cases, were reported.

A total of 1571 deaths were reported (overall case fatality ratio, 67%), including 1477 deaths among confirmed cases. Of the 2338 confirmed and probable cases with known age and sex, 56% (1316) were female, and 29% (681) were children aged less than 18 years. Cases continue to rise among health workers, with the cumulative number infected increasing to 130 (6% of total cases).

5. There've been [about] 700 children infected with #Ebola in this awful outbreak. I don't know how many or what percentage have survived; those who do often find their families decimated. @WHOAFRO is reporting 130 health worker infections; @MinSanteRDC says 127. Either way, too many.]

- Tue 2 Jul 2019. Outbreak rages on
[Los Angeles Times, abridged, edited]
https://www.latimes.com/science/la-sci-ebola-outbreak-congo-20190618-story.html
[Byline: Emily Baumgaertner]

The outbreak is centered in North Kivu and Ituri, heavily populated provinces marked by decades of political instability and violent conflict. As many as 134 separate armed rebel groups have sparred for control of the mineral-rich region in recent years, and an explosion of ethnically motivated kidnappings, maimings and sexual violence displaced at least 300 000 people in June [2019] alone, according to the United Nations.

"The complexity of the environment in North Kivu is unparalleled," said Juliet Bedford, an Oxford University anthropologist who studied the community dynamics of both outbreaks.

In the hot zone, Ebola response teams are caught in the crossfire. Insurgents have launched more than 150 attacks on health workers so far this year [2019], killing 5 and injuring about 50 others. Doctors Without Borders, usually a primary player in disease outbreaks, shut down its treatment centers after multiple attacks in February [2019].

Each violent uprising is followed by a surge of new infections as aid workers lose vital ground.

In the West African outbreak, local health workers meticulously tracked down and isolated each patient's potential contacts, essentially snipping each strand of the outbreak's expanding web.

That's not happening this time. It simply doesn't work in a humanitarian crisis, particularly one marked by a deep-rooted suspicion of authority and huge numbers of people on the move. At least 4.5 million Congolese have been displaced from their homes and neglected by the central government -- breeding distrust in the very figures who are now leading the Ebola response.

[Fewer] than one-third of all confirmed cases have been linked back to known contacts, and more than 80% of new cases have not been followed, according to Doctors Without Borders. On a map, the outbreak pattern is made up of erratic clusters throughout the region rather than a cohesive web of cases.

It also means the total case count is likely much higher than the official figures reported by the WHO, the medical aid group says.

The lack of trust also undermines the value of an experimental Ebola vaccine developed by Merck. The vaccine is more than 95% effective, but health workers can't identify the people most at risk of contracting the virus since families are hiding infected loved ones behind closed doors for fear that they will be hauled away.

With a vaccine shortage looming, experts have debated whether to dilute the remaining doses so they can be spread among more people as the outbreak grows. But the drug is so new that scientists aren't sure it would remain effective.

In 2014, the WHO's decision to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern -- or PHEIC -- came less than 5 months after the virus was detected. At that point, there had been fewer than 1000 deaths.

In the current outbreak, the WHO's emergency committee debated the issue 3 times -- in October [2018], April [2019] and just last month [June 2019] -- as the outbreak enters its 2nd year.

Preben Aavitsland, the emergency committee's acting chair, said that the group spent a great deal of time debating the "possible unintended consequences of such a declaration," such as more targeted attacks on aid workers. They concluded that "the ongoing response would not be enhanced by formal temporary recommendations from WHO."

For example, a declaration could inadvertently provoke travel bans, visa cancellations and trade freezes, which would further devastate the fragile region's economy while making health workers' jobs more difficult. International health regulations forbid such actions, but they happen anyway. A total of 58 countries restricted travel from West Africa during the 2014-2016 epidemic, and several airlines ceased flights to and from the region.

As cases rise, the UN and leading aid groups have triggered a "system-wide scale-up" -- the highest level of emergency response -- putting the Ebola crisis on par with Yemen, Syria, and the cyclone response in Mozambique. The declaration is designed to increase international attention, release extra funding, and improve humanitarian coordination. - Mod.LK]

[3] Educational materials
- Tue 2 Jul 2019. Ebola[e]Education
[Health[e]Foundation, edited]
https://www.healthefoundation.eu/portal/coursedetails.vm?course=38

Health[e]Foundation is pleased to announce that the Ebola module, originally written in 2014 as an informative response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, is updated according to the latest developments.

The direct motive for the current update is the ongoing epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) since August 2018. The 1st version of the module was written by Dr. Jerald Sadoff (JnJ) and is updated by Dr. Galit Alter. Dr. Alter is Professor of Medicine at the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard. Her research is focused on immunity against infectious diseases that ravage the globe and therefore the perfect person to introduce us in the new developments in the fight against Ebola.

The module is written to understand more about the Ebola virus: how it spreads, how it can be controlled, the clinical symptoms and current and potential treatment. Since a vaccine will be the answer to prevent outbreaks, new experimental vaccines are also discussed.

At the moment in the DRC, the Ebola vaccine campaign is intensified as cases mount rapidly. The campaign will promote and expand the use of the experimental Ebola vaccine that more than 110 000 have already received in an attempt to try to stop the unusually stubborn outbreak of the disease. New vaccination strategies will attempt to reduce the safety risks faced by health care workers in the outbreak region.

In the neighbouring country, Uganda, one continues its prevention strategies in the fight against Ebola; more than 4500 frontline and healthcare workers have been vaccinated in 165 health facilities. On 9 Jun [2019] a 5-year-old Congolese child travelled across the border with his family and sought medical care in Uganda. The boy was diagnosed with Ebola and died overnight. His 50-year-old grandmother was also diagnosed with the virus, and died a day later. Now the boy's 3-year-old brother is being treated for the virus near the border. Currently no new cases are reported in Uganda.

Our motto: Knowledge is key to prevention. To start the new informative module, [please see URL above]!

[Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, abridged, edited]
https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011621.pub3/full

Citation: Verbeek JH, Rajamaki B, Ijaz S, et al. Personal protective equipment for preventing highly infectious diseases due to exposure to contaminated body fluids in healthcare staff. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2019, Issue 7. Article no.: CD011621. https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011621.pub3

Conclusions
------------
We found very low quality evidence that more breathable types of personal protective equipment (PPE) may not lead to more contamination, but may have greater user satisfaction. Alterations to PPE, such as tabs to grab may decrease contamination. Double gloving, following CDC doffing guidance, and spoken instructions during doffing may reduce contamination and increase compliance. Face‐to‐face training in PPE use may reduce errors more than video or folder based training. Because data come from single small studies with high risk of bias, we are uncertain about the estimates of effects.

We still need randomised controlled trials to find out which training works best in the long term. We need better simulation studies conducted with several dozen participants to find out which PPE protects best, and what is the safest way to remove PPE. Consensus on the best way to conduct simulation of exposure and assessment of outcome is urgently needed. [Healthcare workers] exposed to highly infectious diseases should have their use of PPE registered and should be prospectively followed for their risk of infection in the field.
