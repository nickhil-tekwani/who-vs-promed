At least 6 bulls [see comment] in Vietnam's central highlands Kon Tum
province suddenly died of an unidentified disease, which damaged
their livers, local newspaper Labor reported Friday [11 Aug 2006].
Most of the cattle in Doan Ket commune, Kon Tum town died after
showing no abnormal symptoms, the paper quoted Nguyen Van Vu,
chairman of the communal People's Committee, as saying.
The bulls have not died of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD], he said,
noting that local veterinary agencies are probing into their death.

[Plausibly, "bulls" might stand, in the above newswire, for cattle,
probably mistranslated; clarification will be helpful. Results of the
investigations, reportedly underway, are anticipated.
It will be interesting to note on what grounds FMD has been excluded:
epidemiological (FMD cases in the vicinity?), clinical, gross
pathology, histology, virology? Indeed, liver damage (hepatitis?) is
not symptomatic of FMD. It will be interesting to note if cardiac
involvement was ruled out in these 6 cases, since pancarditis,
causing sudden asymptomatic death, is one of the possible
manifestations of FMD. Speculatively, one might ask if the hepatic
lesions (with various potential etiologies, infectious as well as
non-infectious) may have merely been a red herring.
Note: pancreatic lesions related to FMD were seen in the past in
Italian cattle (Ref 1) and Israeli mountain gazelles (Ref 2).
