Public health officials in Nova Scotia say they have confirmed 13 cases of measles that are believed to be related.

The deputy chief medical officer of health says all of the cases involve people who have been in the same location as someone infected with measles.

Dr Gaynor Watson-Creed adds that the spread is not surprising given the contagious nature of the illness, but she says it is likely approaching its peak.

She says that some of those infected include health-care workers, and that measures have been put in place to prevent the spread of measles at their workplaces.

Officials say the risk to the public is low because most people have been vaccinated.

Watson-Creed says this cluster of cases is not linked to an outbreak that affected 7 people in the province last month [March 2017].

Director of Communicable Diseases at NSW [New South Wales] Health Dr Vicky Sheppeard said 6 new cases are following another 4 cases that were confirmed last week [week of 26March 2017], many of whom were infectious in the area.

"Ten cases have now been confirmed in the past week, signalling an outbreak of measles in western Sydney particularly in the Auburn and Bankstown local government areas.

"This brings the total number of cases in NSW, with onset this year, to 19," Dr Sheppeard said. She said this latest outbreak reaffirms the importance of getting immunized. "A highly effective measles vaccine has been freely available for many years and it is vital for everyone, including adults and children, to have 2 doses of the measles vaccine during their lifetime."

See the URL above to view the locations visited by the recent cases. Public health units are attempting to contact people who are known to have been in those locations to offer preventative injections.

Symptoms of measles include sore eyes, fever, and a cough followed 3 or 4 days later by a red, blotchy rash spreading from the head and neck all over the body.

NSW health is urging people in western Sydney to take advantage of the free measles vaccine, and to watch for symptoms carefully.

Dr Sheppeard said anybody experiencing measles symptoms should seek medical advice as soon as possible, and stay away from work/school and anywhere with a lot of people.

"Please call ahead to your doctor or emergency department so that arrangements can be made to keep you away from others to minimize the rise of spreading the infection," she said.

"Unless you are certain you have had 2 doses of measles vaccine, you should visit your GP as soon as possible for free measles vaccination, as it is safe to have it again."

The 1st major outbreak of measles in Sydney in 5 years was sparked by a traveller who contracted it in Indonesia, then introduced it to others in western Sydney, NSW [New South Wales] health authorities say.

In the past week 10 cases have been confirmed in the Auburn and Bankstown Local Government areas. "Some were household members of previous cases," she said. "None of the cases were known to be vaccinated."

This is the 1st outbreak in Sydney since 2012 when an overseas visitor spread it to 169 people over a period of months, Ms Sheppeard said.

"[This time] a person has come back from Indonesia, not knowing that they weren't vaccinated, but then attended medical centers in the Auburn area where other people were exposed. Then those people have gone on to spread it to others."

Dr Sheppeard said measles is the most contagious infection out there. "It can spread without even coming into direct contact with the person," she said.

"So it is likely they were in the same shopping center or pharmacy or medical center, not even exactly at the same time as the person who is sick."

The latest cases visited the following known locations while infectious: see URL above

Dr Sheppeard said people with 2 doses of measles vaccinations are 99 percent protected against infection. "Anyone born from the mid-90s on, their vaccination records are available from the immunization register," she said.

"Measles starts with a fever, cough, runny nose and sore red eyes and 3 -- 4 days later a blotchy rash starts on the face and neck. Then it starts to spread to the rest of the face and body.

"Unless you are certain you have had 2 doses of measles vaccine, you should visit your GP as soon as possible for free measles vaccination, as it is safe to have it again."

Dr Daniel Iya, the Nasarawa State Commissioner for Health, says the state has recorded 5 cases of measles.

"We have high coverage of immunization based on data collected and now getting information about measles outbreak not being documented shows there is a problem," he said.

He said the ministry had begun investigation to ascertain what could be responsible, saying breakage in the 'cold chain' facility for the vaccine reduces its potency, given the challenges of power supply for its management.

Iya stressed the need to strengthen routine immunization rather than back immunization, cross check the cold chain and to raise the index of suspicion against disease outbreaks.

He emphasized the need for stakeholders to adhere strictly to routine immunization so as to check outbreak of communicable diseases.

The international humanitarian organisation Médecins Sans Frontières/Doctors without Borders (MSF) is launching today a large scale measles vaccination campaign in Conakry [capital of Guinea], together with the Guinean Ministry of Health. Since the beginning of the year [2017] there have been 3468 confirmed cases and 14 deaths due to measles in Guinea. Conakry and Nzérékoré are the most affected districts.

Routine vaccination in Guinea was drastically reduced during the 2014-2015 Ebola epidemic, both because most resources and attention were geared towards the management of Ebola and, mainly, due to fear. People stayed away from health facilities and vaccination activities were suspended because of infection risks, and this left thousands of young children unprotected against easily preventable diseases. A nation-wide vaccination campaign was organized by authorities one year ago to vaccinate the children who had not received their shots (MSF did not participate to this campaign). Despite this catch up effort, a measles epidemic was declared on [Wed 8 Feb 2017].

"The fact that a new epidemic occurs barely a year after a massive vaccination campaign is a worrying sign of the weakness of health care in Guinea", says Ibrahim Diallo, MSF's representative in Guinea. "Major problems remain in the health system, undermining its capacity to prevent and respond to outbreaks effectively and in a timely manner."

After the devastating Ebola epidemic that killed over 11 000 people and severely affected the health systems of the 3 most affected countries (Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia), the WHO and leading public health experts insisted on the importance of rebuilding responsive health systems in the 3 countries, equipping and supporting them to better manage similar or new health crises.

According to the UN body in charge of Ebola response, only 18 percent of the funds disbursed to support countries during Ebola were meant for recovery. International donor commitments to health systems strengthening have focused on improving disease surveillance to ensure early detection and response to outbreaks, such as Ebola. However, in the face of a large outbreak of measles, MSF (in Conakry) and Alima (in Nzérokoré district) are currently the only NGOs providing support to the Ministry of Health for the vaccination campaign in the worst affected districts. WHO and UNICEF have pledged support to other affected districts across the country, which is still under discussion.

"If Ebola was a wakeup call, since then the world seems to have fallen back asleep. As shown by this measles outbreak, the concrete impact of the promises of funding, support and training made during and after the Ebola crisis still remains to be felt by ordinary Guineans", says Dr Mit Philips, MSF's Health Policy Analyst. "Access to good healthcare was clearly lacking before Ebola struck, and the country is still facing today the same problems that it was facing then, largely alone, in spite of the international public commitments to build better and more responsive health systems".

To contain the measles epidemic, MSF, with the Ministry of Health in Conakry, is mobilizing 126 teams of 13 people, spread out across 164 vaccination sites in a city of 3 million people. All children from 6 months up to 10 years old will be vaccinated. MSF also supports 30 health centers in Conakry to care for children suffering from mild cases of measles, as well as the referral center where severe cases are hospitalized.

Notes to editors

MSF and Ebola response: From the very beginning of the recent Ebola epidemic, MSF responded in the worst affected countries - Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone - by setting up Ebola treatment centers and providing services such as treatment and care, psychological support, health promotion, surveillance and contact tracing. At its peak, MSF employed nearly 4000 national staff and over 325 international staff to combat the epidemic across the 3 countries. MSF admitted a total of 10 376 patients to its Ebola management centers, of which 5226 were confirmed Ebola cases.

MSF in Guinea: MSF has been working in Guinea since 1984 and has previously assisted in outbreaks concerning cholera and measles. It is currently providing HIV and TB services in collaboration with the Ministry of Health, supporting treatment to around 9000 HIV patients. The organization closed its Ebola-related activities supporting survivors last September [2016] in Guinea.

On measles: Measles is one of the most contagious viral diseases today, where one infected person can contaminate up to 18 non - immunized people. Worldwide an estimated 367 people, mostly children, die of measles every day, half of them in sub-Saharan Africa. Measles vaccination coverage of 95 percent of a population prevents the occurrence of outbreaks and epidemics within this population.

[With the end of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, attention needs to focus on rebuilding the health infrastructure so other public health problems such as TB, HIV, malaria, and vaccine-preventable diseases can be addressed. This, of course, takes financial support, expertise, and health care workers.

Health officials in Portugal reported 2 confirmed cases of measles and are telling the public not to be alarmed, according to a Publico news report (computer translated).

The cases involve a person who has recently come from Venezuela and an 11-month-old baby who is not yet old enough to be vaccinated.

Health officials say they are 2 isolated situations with no temporal relation between them.

Deputy Director-General for Health, Graça Freitas stresses that this is not an outbreak, at least for now in Portugal, contrary to what is happening in several European countries.

The report notes that measles was declared eliminated in Portugal last year [2016].

Nevertheless, health officials are asking people who do not have the measles vaccine to be immunized.

"Eliminated does not mean that Portugal cannot have cases from other countries. It is normal for Portugal to have isolated cases, "emphasizes Graça Freitas.

The vaccination coverage rate in Portugal is high, ranging from 95 to 97 percent.

An unvaccinated Laguna Beach High School student has been quarantined by county health officials after contracting measles.

Jessica Good, spokeswoman for the Orange County Health Care Agency, said [Thu 6 Apr 2017], that the teen may have exposed other students to the highly contagious virus.

Infectious disease specialists did an assessment at the high school and identified 6 other unvaccinated students who may have been exposed to the virus when the infected student was on campus [Wed 29 Mar 2017]. All of them have been barred from attending school and will have to stay home until [Tue 18 Apr 2017], the end of the incubation period, Good said.

The case is the 2nd in the county in 2017. The 1st case was reported to the Health Care Agency earlier this year [January 2017]. The adult, who was vaccinated, was exposed on an international flight. Because the person chose to self-quarantine and there was no risk of exposure, the county agency is not required to disclose the person's identity or location, Good said.

In 2016, there were 35 reported cases in the county.

On [Wed 5 Apr 2017], the Laguna Beach Unified School District sent notices to all parents of students in its 4 schools. The notification included symptoms associated with the infectious disease, including fever; rash; cough; and red, watery eyes. Measles spreads easily by air and by direct contact with an infected person. It is contagious even before a rash appears.

The district advised parents who notice any of these symptoms to notify the Health Care Agency immediately.

Children must be immunized against the following 9 diseases: diphtheria, hepatitis B., measles, mumps, whooping cough, polio, rubella, tetanus and chicken pox.

A state law, Senate Bill 277, that went into effect in 2016, says parents of children who attend public or private schools can no longer refuse to vaccinate their children based on personal belief. They can still receive medical exemptions. If parents submitted personal-belief exemptions prior to 1 January 2016, the exemptions will remain in place until the student is in 7th grade.
