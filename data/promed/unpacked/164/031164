Fear of Epidemic of Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever in Panama
------------------------------------------------------
PANAMA: The Panamanian health authorities fear that there will be an
epidemic of fatal dengue hemorrhagic fever and are beginning an intense
prevention campaign. The campaign includes fumigations and heavy fines of
between 10 and 5000 dollars [Panamanian for persons in whose households
they encounter standing water which can serve as breeding sites for the
_Aedes aegypti_ mosquito.
Since the beginning of this year, the authorities have detected 517 cases
of classic dengue fever and 3 of dengue hemorrhagic fever. In contrast,
during the year 2000, 300 cases of classic dengue fever and 3 of dengue
hemorrhagic fever were reported. The authorities are concerned by the
increase in cases of classical dengue fever in comparison with last year,
because this increase carries the possibility that there will be reports of
more cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever. [The risk of contracting dengue
hemorrhagic fever is increased when patients who have recovered from an
initial attack of dengue fever are exposed to infection by dengue virus of
a heterologous serotype. - Mod.CP
The health authorities and those of civil defense are undertaking intensive
operations of fumigation and campaigns on raising public awareness on the
need for elimination of standing water where the mosquito can reproduce.
The operations have been intensified in rural areas of the capital, where
the highest incidence of dengue fever has been reported.

A Comment Related to the Current Dengue Fever Outbreak in Hawaii
----------------------------------------------------------------
The current unfortunate situation in Hawaii reminds me of a very good
synopsis of Peter Whelan's detailed account on how the Northern Territory
of Australia manages to be free of dengue fever, when neighboring tropical
Queensland gets occasional outbreaks (see: _Aedes_ mosquitoes imported -
Australia (NT) (03) 20000320.0390.)
When larvae of 2 species of mosquito were discovered by quarantine officers
in Darwin's shipping yard, in the water of cargo of mining equipment just
arrived from East Timor, a very aggressive spraying procedure ensued. All
artificial containers and premises in the vicinity were sprayed, and the
general area was "misted" and "fogged" by a residual insecticide ("ultra
low volume bioresmethrin insecticide") with agreement of all concerned.
This was followed up by strict quarantine procedures and increased egg trap
surveillance and larvae inspection of all artificial containers in the area
over a period of several months.
Other measures are adopted in other parts of the world! For example one of
the measures used by the government of El Salvador in the fight against
dengue-carrying mosquitoes, was to fine those who did not cooperate in the
destruction of breeding sites. A state emergency was declared, but in spite
of these, and other measures, there were almost 2000 cases of dengue
between Jan and Feb 2000, including 300 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever.

I find [the statement "All Hawaii residents... are being urged to keep
their properties free of sites where mosquitoes can breed" laughable.
My family lives in the Puna area of the Big Island and, as with the vast
majority of residents out there, obtains its household water by water
catchment. Most household water catchment supplies are kept covered, but
every household I have ever visited out there has at least a half a dozen
other uncovered catchment [containers used for watering plants, providing
drinking water for animals, etc. Given that Hilo is the wettest city (most
rainfall) in the United States, I wonder how feasible [that "pipe dream' is.
That said, I have informed my family of this emerging threat and am hoping
they take it seriously enough to further protect themselves against mosquitos.
