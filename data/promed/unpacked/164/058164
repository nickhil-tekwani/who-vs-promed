The Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services' (VDACS)
Office of Veterinary Services has received confirmation from the
National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa that
samples from cattle in Orange County are positive for epizootic
hemorrhagic disease (EHD).

VDACS had gotten reports from veterinarians and cattle producers of
ulcers, sore mouths, reluctance to eat and lameness in cattle, all of
which indicate the possibility of EHD [These clinical signs also rule
out foot and mouth disease. - Mod.TG].

While NVSL performed blood tests confirming the cattle had been
exposed to the virus, that does not mean they actually have
contracted the disease. Many people believe that cattle can get a
disease similar to EHD in deer, but science has yet to prove that.
VDACS is taking precautions, however, by advising cattle owners to
report signs that may appear to be EHD to their local veterinarian
just to reduce the possibility of overlooking other more serious
diseases and to be on the safe side of animal health.

Cattle infected with EHD may experience weight loss or decreased milk
production while signs are present. The disease is rarely fatal in
cattle and poses no known threat to human health. Epizootic
hemorrhagic disease, a disease common to white-tailed deer, comes
from a virus carried by biting gnats, and it typically occurs in
warm, dry conditions. The 1st hard frost will usually kill the
disease-carrying gnats. In the meantime, to prevent EHD in cattle,
VDACS recommends keeping them away from deer and using external
parasite control.

For more information on EHD in cattle, check with your veterinarian,
or contact VDACS' Division of Animal and Food Industry Services at
804 692-0601. For information about EHD in deer, contact the Virginia
Department of Game and Inland Fisheries at 804 367-1000.

[EHD is an orbivirus that is closely related to the virus causing
bluetongue disease. Knowledge of orbiviruses indicate more research
is needed, but there is evidence that EHD can affect cattle. - Mod.TG]
