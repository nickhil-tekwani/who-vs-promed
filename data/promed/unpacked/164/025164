Ebola Situation Report - 15 Apr 2015
------------------------------------
Summary
-------
A total of 37 confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) was reported in the week to 12 Apr 2015, compared with 30 the previous week. Case incidence in Guinea increased to 28, compared with 21 confirmed cases the previous week. Sierra Leone reported 9 confirmed cases, the same total as in the previous week. Liberia reported no confirmed cases.

A total of 5 Guinean prefectures reported at least 1 confirmed case in the week to 12 Apr 2015, compared with 6 the previous week. Transmission remains confined to the western area, and is primarily focused on the prefecture of Forecariah, which borders Sierra Leone. In total, 8 prefectures/districts in Guinea and Sierra Leone reported a confirmed case in the week to 12 Apr 2015, compared with 10 the previous week. This is the lowest number of districts to report a confirmed case since the end of May 2014. Of 55 districts in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone that have reported at least one confirmed case of EVD since the start of the outbreak, 39 have not reported a case for over 6 weeks.

In the context of falling case incidence and a receding zone of transmission, treatment capacity exceeds demand in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Accordingly, and with technical guidance from WHO, national authorities in both countries have begun to implement plans for the phased safe decommissioning of surplus facilities. Each country will retain a core capacity of high-quality Ebola treatment centres, strategically located to ensure complete geographic coverage, with additional rapid-response capacity held in reserve.

In Sierra Leone, cases were reported from 3 western districts: Kambia (4 cases), Port Loko (1 case), and Western Area Urban (4 cases), which includes the capital, Freetown.

Response indicators from Sierra Leone continue to be encouraging. The number of EVD-positive deaths that were identified in the community after post-mortem testing was 3 in the week to 12 Apr 2015. The low proportion of laboratory samples that tested EVD-positive (9 of 1338: less than 1 percent) and the increasing proportion of cases that arise among registered contacts (67 percent for the most recent reporting period) strengthen confidence that the downward trend in case incidence over the past 5 weeks will continue.

By contrast, response indicators for Guinea continue to present a mixed picture. A total of 8 confirmed deaths from EVD in the week to 12 Apr 2015 were identified post-mortem in the community. In addition, the proportion of confirmed cases that arose among registered contacts remained below 50 percent for the 2nd consecutive week, at 44 percent. More positively, the number of laboratory samples tested increased for a 4th consecutive week to 518 in the week to 12 Apr 2015: but 10 percent of samples tested positive for EVD.

A case-finding and community sensitization operation took place in the Guinean prefecture of Forecariah from 12 to 15 Apr 2105. In the 1st 3 days over 29 000 households were visited, with 23 suspected cases identified and tested. Similar operations will take place in the prefectures of Boffa, Conakry, Coyah, Dubreka, and Kindia.

The last confirmed case in Liberia died on 27 Mar 2105. Investigations are ongoing to establish the origin of infection. A total of 2 contacts associated with the case were being monitored as at 11 Apr 2105. Heightened vigilance is being maintained throughout the country. In the 6 days to 11 Apr 2015, 332 laboratory samples were tested for EVD, with no confirmed cases. 42 days will have elapsed since the last confirmed case on 8 May 2015.

There was one new health worker infection in the week to 12 Apr 2015, with the cumulative total increasing to 864 since the start of the outbreak.

Countries with widespread and intense transmission
--------------------------------------------------
There have been a total of 25 791 reported confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of EVD in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone (figure 1, table 1), with over 10 600 reported deaths (outcomes for many cases are unknown). A total of 28 new confirmed cases were reported in Guinea, 0 in Liberia, and 9 in Sierra Leone in the 7 days to 12 Apr 2015.

The total number of confirmed and probable cases is similar in males and females (table 2). Compared with children (people aged 14 years and under), people aged 15 to 44 are approximately 3 times more likely to be affected. People aged 45 and over are 3-5 times more likely to be affected than are children.

A total of 864 confirmed health worker infections have been reported in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone; there have been 503 reported deaths (table 5). ... more

[4] WHO warning on safe sex
Date: Wed 15 Apr 2015
Source: BBC News [edited]
http://www.bbc.com/news/health-32284629


Ebola survivors 'safe sex warning' issued by WHO
------------------------------------------------
The WHO has urged Ebola survivors to be even more cautious during sexual contact to ensure the virus is not passed on to their partners.

The warning comes after a survivor was found to have traces of Ebola in his semen almost 6 months after recovery.

This is some 90 days later than previously documented.

It is unclear whether Ebola can still be spread at this point. But officials have launched further investigations to evaluate the risks.

New evidence
------------
There have been no proven cases of Ebola being transmitted through sexual contact with survivors during this or previous outbreaks.

But according to Dr Nathalie Broutet, a medical officer at the World Health Organization, the recent case prompted experts to strengthen their advice.

Dr Broutet told the BBC: "The patient is the 1st we have seen where there is a trace of virus present in semen beyond 3 months. "This made us change our recommendations to go beyond 3 months."

The new advice says: "For greater security and prevention of other sexually transmitted infections, Ebola survivors should consider correct and consistent use of condoms for all sexual acts beyond 3 months until more information is available."

It builds on previous guidance suggesting abstinence or safe sex up to 90 days after symptoms 1st develop. But Dr Broutet cautioned further analysis must be done. "Even though the sample was positive for fragments of the virus this does not prove it was passed on sexually. We need to be very careful and need more clarity about this," she said.

Scientists are planning to send the sample to the Centres for Disease Control in the United States to see if the traces of Ebola they found are active and capable of being spread. And Dr Broutet is helping to set up studies in Sierra Leone and Guinea to offer male survivors further checks.

According to the WHO, there is no current evidence to suggest that active Ebola virus is present in vaginal fluids once someone has recovered. Ebola is known to spread through close contact with the bodily fluids of a person who has the active virus and shows symptoms of the disease -- such as a high fever.

Experts emphasise that people who have recovered from Ebola do not pose any risks to the general public and should not be isolated.

[See http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/rtis/ebola-virus-semen/en/ for a summary of the results of studies on sexual transmission of Ebola virus published 1999-2007. WHO states in this report: "There is evidence that live Ebola virus can be isolated in seminal fluids of convalescent men for 82 days after onset of symptoms, evidence is not available yet beyond 82 days*. Ebola RNA has been detected by RT-PCR in semen of one patient up to day 101 after symptom onset." It is important to make the distinction between live infectious virus and viral RNA. The risk posed by RNA alone, with no evidence of infectious virus, is most likely negligible, but until laboratory experiments are conducted or hard evidence exists, the WHO is erring on the side of caution. There are enough male survivors of Ebola that the question should be able to be answered with longitudinal checks of the semen viral and RNA load. But experiments may be required to confirm transmissibility or lack thereof of infectious virus.
