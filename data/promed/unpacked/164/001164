A new case of mad cow disease has been found in Belgium, bringing the total
found in the country to nine, RTBF television reported on Tuesday.
A farm near Chimay in southern Belgium was diagnosed with mad cow disease,
or Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), after the farmer reported
symptoms and had it slaughtered.
It is the second case to be discovered in Belgium in 1999. A cow in
Lontzen, also in southern Belgium, was diagnosed in April.
Roland Hanot, veterinarian for the Chimay farm said laboratory tests had
confirmed the diagnosis, and a comprehensive inquiry had been launched to
identify the source of the infection.
All the other cows on the farm were being taken away to be destroyed.
