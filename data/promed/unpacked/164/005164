[While travel to the affected area is less likely, it is interesting to see
the alerts for RSA, especially in light of the imported case with secondary
transmission related to the Ebola outbreak in Kikwit in 1996. Also, the
reminder that this is occurring in an area of
conflict, with the risk of transmission amongst the "troops" in the area,
along with the presence of "foreign" troops. There is the theoretical risk
of imported cases to countries of origin of the foreign troops - MPP

Travellers to Central Africa have been reminded to take their
own sterile medical equipment kit after reports of an outbreak of what is
suspected to be Ebola fever in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
South African port health officials have also been warned to be vigilant
regarding travellers arriving here from Central Africa.
In 1996, a Gauteng [South Africa nursing sister died after being infected
with Ebola by a Gabonese patient. British Airways Travel Clinic doctor
Andrew Jamieson said Ebola was a dangerous and extremely virulent viral
infection.
He warned travellers to all high-risk areas in Africa to carry their own
sterile medical equipment kit.
The specific area affected in the Democratic Republic of Congo is the Watsa
locality, an isolated area where fighting has made investigation extremely
difficult.
Dr Jamieson said the World Health Organisation and Medicins sans Frontieres
were investigating the outbreak. The last outbreak of Ebola in the country
was in the town of Kikwit when 350 people died.

DRC soldiers on Ebola alert
---------------------------------------
Government will send medical supplies to Namibian soldiers in the Congo
following an outbreak of an Ebola-like fever.
Vincent Mwange, representative of the Ministry of Defence, said in an
interview yesterday although Namibian soldiers in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC) were secure from the unidentified viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF)
[Marburg virus has been identified - MPP, Government was leaving nothing to
chance.
"Preventive measures have been put in place," said Mwange. "But there is no
cause for concern. Our troops are operating far from the area where the
outbreak is said to have struck." Mwange said there was no reason for
Namibians to worry that the fever might wreak havoc among the troops. Even
the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry
of Health, Dr Kalumbi Shangula, said no special alert would be put out
because there were no people entering Namibia from the areas that had been
affected.
The Home Affairs Ministry reacted in a similar fashion saying it would not
take any special measures but would monitor the situation closely together
with other Southern African Development Communities (SADC) countries.

The ministry of health has set up a National task force to monitor the
spread of the Haemorrahgic fever which has killed 63 people in the
neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo writes Nathan Etengu.
The Director General of Health Services, Prof. Francis Omaswa said in a
press release yesterday the task force was to prepare a response to prevent
the spread of the disease to Uganda.
"The Ministry of Health has reviewed the situation and an alert has been
sent to all districts neighbouring the DRC and southern Sudan," Omaswa said.
He said that the District directors of Health services in Arua,Nebbi, Fort
Portal, Rukungiri, Kabale and Kisoro had been alerted to watch out for any
person with an illness similar to that of the fever.
He said that the ministry had also alerted all cross-border posts and
airports(Entebbe and Arua) to monitor passengers crossing from the
Democratic Republic of Congo. He said that the ministry was also seconding
an Epidemiologist to work with the WHO sub-station in Kisangani to monitor
the situation and coordinate the surveillance.
Prof. Omaswa disclosed that the country experienced a similar type of
disease in 1978 when 19 members of one family in Bugiri district and some
staff from Bugiri hospital died. He said the disease was identified that
time as a Marburg virus which he said is closely related to Ebola.
He said the disease is a reservoir in wild animals but occasionally cross
into human beings. He said the ministry had developed health education
guidelines in which persons are advised not to get into contact with any
patients without protection. He also said that no one should eat meat from
dead animals.
