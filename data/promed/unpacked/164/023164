Bac Lieu Province has discovered 4 new H5N1 pandemic sources in the
province, and had to cull 1600 ducks yesterday.

The total number of communes and wards in the province discovered as having
poultry dead from diseases has reached 16. Bac Lieu has decided to cull all
unvaccinated poultry under 14 days old in order to prevent the bird flu
epidemic from spreading.

Vinh Binh commune in Hoa Binh district has decided to cull a herd of 300
ducks. Long Thanh and Vinh Loi communes have killed 750 ducks and 2
communes in Gia Lai district have killed 450 [avians].

Head of the Bac Lieu Veterinary Agency Lam Tri Thong said that the diseased
fowls and ducks had just been inoculated, and the time from the vaccination
until infection was not long enough to ensure the immunity. In order to
prevent the bird flu epidemic from spreading, the provincial authority has
decided to take drastic measures to control the pandemic.

"All the fowls and ducks that have not been vaccinated will be culled," Mr
Thong said.

Yesterday the southern province of Hau Giang [see commentary] discovered
another pandemic hotspot area, where 22 fowls were dead. However, it is not
sure if the fowls died from H5N1. Specimens of the dead fowls have been
sent for testing. There has been no new pandemic source discovered in Ca
Mau province.

Meanwhile, Soc Trang province has discovered dead fowls and ducks in
several districts. However, according to Nguyen Huu Minh, Deputy Head of
Soc Trang Veterinary Agency, the dead poultry did not show signs of H5N1
infection.

According to the Ca Mau Health Department, 5 persons in the province ate
dead fowls and were hospitalised; however, not one of them was found
infected with H5N1 virus.

On 2 Jan 2007, the Government Office released a notice about Prime Minister
Nguyen Tan Dung's conclusion on the prevention and fight against the bird
flu in southern provinces. The pandemic sources in Ca Mau, Bac Lieu and Hau
Giang have been put under strict control; however, there remain high risks
of the virus spreading to other localities. He has urged local authorities
to take drastic measures to prevent the spreading of the pandemic, while
ensuring normal poultry farming.

[The current outbreak in Vietnam affects 3 provinces in the Mekong basin in
southern Vietnam. The province Hau Giang (not to be confused with the
northern province Ha Giang, as erroneously spelled in the title of posting
20070102.0015) is situated north of the provinces Soc Trang and Bac Lieu;
see map at

The map referred to in item [2] of the posting 20061231.3662 was of Ha
Giang and not of Hau Giang. We are grateful to subscriber Dung Do
