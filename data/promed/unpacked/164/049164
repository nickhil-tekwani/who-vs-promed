TSUNAMI-RELATED DISEASE POTENTIAL - ASIA (02)

As I am watching the news about the catastrophe in the Indian Ocean
area, I am amazed how often it is mentioned that because of the fear
of epidemics, dead bodies have to be buried as quickly as possible.
Looks like we are still in the 19th century, with all the theories
about miasma (meaning bad air, hence "malaria") and dead bodies.
As far as I remember, several scientific studies have shown that
after natural disasters, the dead bodies of victims do not cause any
increase in the spread of communicable diseases. It is the
accompanying situation (lack of safe water, lack of proper sanitation
for "still alive" human beings -- well, lack of everything....) that
constitutes a threat. Those who fell victim to the disaster and
their bodies do no harm, apart from looking ugly and smelling while
decomposing.
Whatever infectious agents the deceased victims of the tsunami
harbored while still alive will pose less threat to the public health
than when they were alive, and no new organisms will develop while
the dead bodies are rotting. The real threat to public health is
posed by those still living, some of whom may spread infectious
agents, and the worsened conditions that help spread whatever they
may carry.
Therefore, the utmost priority from a public health point of view is
not to bury all the dead immediately (which is what people on TV seem
to be telling us), but to restore the safety of the water supply. In
fact, for many of the affected countries, it is not a matter of
"restoring" but establishing a safe source of water!!! It will also
be important to pay attention to environmental issues like vector
control, waste disposal, and hygiene education.

[The ISID publication "A Guide to Infection Control in the Hospital"
(http://www.isid.org) has a chapter entitled "Infection Hazards of
Human Cadavers" written by T.D. Healing, MSc, PhD, P. Hoffman, BSc,
and S.E.J. Young, FRCP.
Some excerpts:
"Sometimes, natural or man-made disasters may mean that the normal
disposal procedures cannot be followed. Under these circumstances,
care must be taken to ensure that the disposal of human remains does
not face an already stressed population with further risks. Ideally
bodies should be cremated but if this is not possible burial with at
least 1 metre of earth over the cadavers (to prevent access by
scavengers and pests) is a satisfactory alternative. Religious and
social practices should be followed as far as possible. Burial sites
must be chosen so as to avoid the risks that water sources may be
contaminated."
and
"-The major hazard facing emergency service personnel is spilt blood
and any risk can be greatly reduced by preventing contact with blood
(use of gloves, face and eye protection, and protective clothing
where necessary).
-Bodies that have been decaying for some time present little risk.
The organisms likely to be present are their own body flora and water
or environmental organisms. The use of proper protective clothing
will protect personnel handling such material.
-Bodies should always be transported to mortuary facilities in
waterproof body bags or cleanable, fluid retentive (e.g. fiberglass)
temporary coffins."
