China confirms new human death from bird flu
----------------------------------------------------------
A 22-year-old Chinese man from the central province of Hunan has died
of the H5N1 strain of bird flu, the 2nd death from the disease since
late last year [2007], the Health Ministry said on Monday [18 Feb
2008]. The man 1st noticed symptoms of fever and headache on [16 Jan
2008]. He went to hospital several days later and died on [24 Jan
2008], the ministry said on its Web site. The provincial disease
control and prevention centre subsequently collected a specimen from
the victim on [15 Feb 2008], and the initial tests for the bird flu
virus were positive. A specimen was then sent to the Center for
Disease Control and Prevention in Beijing, which confirmed it as
testing positive for the H5N1 virus on Sunday [17 Feb 2008], the ministry said.

The ministry did not explain the reason for the delay in testing the
victim for bird flu, but Hunan was one of the provinces most badly
hit by freak snowstorms that killed over 100 people and cut off roads
and power in many parts of central and southern China in late January
and early February [2008]. The ministry said the local government had
taken appropriate action. "All people in close contact with the
victim have been given strict medical examinations, and up until now
no abnormal conditions have been discovered," it said in its
statement. It added that it had informed the World Health
Organization and other foreign government authorities of the case.
With the world's biggest poultry population and millions of backyard
birds roaming free, China is at the centre of the fight against bird
flu. The country has now had 28 human cases, including 18 deaths.
