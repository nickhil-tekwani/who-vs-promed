--------------------------------------------------------------
It may be of some relevance to clarify which biotype or biotypes of the 'benign' _Theileria orientalis_ group are involved in this reported event.

The 3 biotypes of relevance in eastern Australia are the buffeli, chitose, and ikeda biotypes. In eastern Australia, most, if not all, clinical illness in cattle appears to have been associated with presence of the ikeda biotype either alone or in combination with others, but it is also apparent that mere presence of the ikeda biotype does not always appear to be associated with clinical or observable anaemia or illness in cattle in eastern Australia.

There appear to be 2 primary syndromes associated with infection in eastern Australia:

1. An anaemia, abortion/stillbirth syndrome (usually with no observable lymphadenopathy -- a highly significant clinical issue), as described in the original post, in adult cattle originating from a parasite (and often also tick vector) free region when moved to an infected region, or conversely, in adult cattle within a hitherto unaffected tick vector-infested region apparently after movement of carrier livestock from an endemically affected region; and

2. A severe, highly non-responsive, acute anaemia syndrome in calves (usually 2-6+ months of age) in tick vector and parasite endemic areas, particularly when seasonal calving and calf-hood coincide with the highest risk period for tick vectors (late winter through to mid summer).

Obviously many things are yet to be learned about the complexities of the host (cattle)-vector (tick)-parasite relationships in Australia. Of recent years, perhaps more emphasis and effort have been directed towards elucidating some of the complexities of the host-parasite relationship than have been focused on the vector tick-parasite relationship, including potential for variability in 'competence' within the putative tick vector population to account for significant aspects of the clinical outcomes in the exposed host population (as is the observed reality in other areas of the world afflicted by non-benign, highly pathogenic _Theileria_ spp).
