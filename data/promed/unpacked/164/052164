[The CIDRAP report reproduced below is a summary of a WHO review
document, which updates a 2005 report published in the New England
Journal of Medicine in October 2005 (available at
<http://content.nejm.org/cgi/reprint/353/13/1374.pdf> and
see also: Avian influenza, human - East Asia (138): WHO review
20051003.2892), and which incorporates information recently
published or presented at the "Second World Health Organization (WHO)
Consultation on Clinical Aspects of Human Infection with Avian
Influenza A (H5N1) Virus."

This 2008 update is published in the 17 Jan 2008 issue of the New
England Journal of Medicine (Volume 358(3): 261-273,
(<http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/358/3/261>)
and is entitled "Update on Avian Influenza A (H5N1) Virus Infection
in Humans," by the Writing Committee of the "Second World Health
Organization Consultation on Clinical Aspects of Human Infection with
Avian Influenza A (H5N1) Virus." The members of the Writing Committee
are Abdel-Nasser Abdel-Ghafar, MD, Tawee Chotpitayasunondh, MD,

Exposure source unclear in 25 percent of human H5N1 cases
---------------------------------------------------------
In at least 25 percent of human infections with the H5N1 avian
influenza virus, just how the person was exposed to the virus remains
a mystery, according to a report by an expert panel set up by the
World Health Organization (WHO). "In one quarter or more of patients
with influenza A (H5N1) infection virus infection, the source of
exposure is unclear, and environment-to-human transmission remains
possible," says the report, which appears today [16 Jan 2008] in the
New England Journal of Medicine [see: Virus. Update on avian
influenza A (H5N1) virus infection in humans. By the Writing
Committee of the "Second World Health Organization Consultation on
Clinical Aspects of Human Infection with Avian Influenza A (H5N1)
Virus. N Engl J Med 2008 Jan 17; 358(3),
<http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/358/3/261>].

The predominant source of exposure in H5N1 cases is contact with
infected poultry in the week before onset of illness, the article
notes. But in cases involving no such contact, patients might have
touched contaminated objects (fomites) or fertilizer containing
poultry feces, or have inhaled aerosolized infectious material. The
only known risk factor for some patients was visiting a live-poultry
market, the article says. The discussion of exposure sources is part
of a review of all aspects of human H5N1 cases, including
epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, and
prevention. The report is based on the WHO's "Second Consultation on
Clinical Aspects of Human Infection with Avian Influenza A (H5N1)
Virus," a meeting held in Antalya, Turkey, in March 2007.

About a quarter of all human cases have occurred in clusters of 2 or
more that were epidemiologically linked, the report says. More than
90 percent of the clusters have involved blood relatives, suggesting
a possible genetic susceptibility to the infection. Most people in
the clusters probably were infected through common exposure to
poultry, "but limited, nonsustained human-to-human transmission has
probably occurred during very close, unprotected contact with a
severely ill patient," the article states.

Regarding the virus's evolution, the report has a chart that shows a
total of 10 different clades (including the original 1997 strain from
Hong Kong), or lineages, plus 5 subclades in clade 2. "Changes in
multiple viral genes" -- not just the surface protein known as
hemagglutinin -- "are probably required to generate a potentially
pandemic influenza A (H5N1) virus," the article says. So far, the
virus is not transmissible among ferrets or swine, and reassortment
(hybridization) between an H5N1 virus and an H3N2 (human-adapted)
virus did not produce a virus transmissible among ferrets.

Concerning host responses, the report does not fully endorse the
"cytokine storm" theory: the proposition that the severe disease in
H5N1 cases is a result of an overly intense immune response. The
tissue damage "probably results from the combined effects of
unrestrained viral infection and inflammatory responses" induced by
the infection, it says. Further, the current understanding of the
immune response to the infection is not adequate to guide efforts to
treat the disease by modifying the immune response, the panel says.

In line with that, the report repeats previous WHO advice against the
routine use of corticosteroids in H5N1 patients. Corticosteroid
therapy has not been effective, and prolonged or high-dose
corticosteroids can lead to serious adverse events. As for antiviral
drugs, the panel says that clade 1 viruses and most clade 2 viruses
from Indonesia are fully resistant to M2 inhibitors (amantadine and
rimantadine), but the other clade 2 viruses from other parts of
Eurasia and Africa are usually susceptible to these older drugs. The
article repeats the standard recommendation for early treatment with
oseltamivir, a neuraminidase inhibitor. The panel also reiterates
previous WHO statements that doubling the standard oseltamivir dose
and duration of treatment may be reasonable. Resistance to the drug
has been seen in a few patients, and clade 1 viruses seem to be more
susceptible than some clade 2 viruses, though the clinical relevance
of this difference is unclear.

Concerning H5N1 vaccines, the panel writes that certain proprietary
adjuvants seem to be highly effective in antigen sparing (reducing
the amount of antigen needed to generate an immune response) and
inducing cross-reactive antibody responses. However, the antibody
levels needed for protection against the virus are unknown. The
report stops short of endorsing prepandemic vaccination -- giving an
existing H5N1 vaccine before a pandemic in the hope that it will
yield some protection against a later H5N1-based pandemic strain or
will at least prime the immune system so that just one dose of a
specific pandemic vaccine would be necessary.

Decisions about prepandemic vaccination require complex risk-benefit
and cost-benefit analyses because of likely effects on seasonal
vaccine production and the chance that mass vaccinations would
trigger adverse events, the article says.

Some other observations in the report:
- The median age of H5N1 case-patients is about 18, and 90 percent of
patients have been 40 years or younger.
- While the disease typically leads to severe pneumonia, febrile
upper respiratory illnesses without pneumonia have been seen in
children, particularly since 2005.
- About 15 percent to 20 percent of older adults have some antibodies
to H5N1 and might respond to a single dose of vaccine.
