MEASLES - NEW ZEALAND (06): ALERT
*********************************
A ProMED-mail post

[The following comprehensive update has been received in response to
the request for more information in the ProMED-mail post: Measles -
New Zealand (05) 20090712.2498. - Mod.CP]

As at 1100 hours on Tue 14 Jul 2009 there are now 26 reported cases in
the Christchurch outbreak, with 16 confirmed serologically and
confirmation awaited for a further 8 (2 cases have refused blood
tests). 14 of the cases are related to one high school for boys (this
includes 2 pairs of siblings) and 3 of these were in the same class.
The remainder of the cases are spread over the city with no obvious
geographical connections. A few have social connections to the boys
high school pupils.

It is currently the 2nd week of school winter vacation here in New
Zealand and many families will have travelled out of town, so other
public health units elsewhere in New Zealand have been advised of the
outbreak and an alert notice was placed on PacNet as the Pacific
Islands (particularly Fiji) are popular destinations for New Zealand
holidaymakers in the winter.

Onset dates range from 4 Jun 2009 to 12 Jul 2009. Cases are
predominantly male (21/26) with an age range from 9 months to 22
years, though most are aged between 11-16.

A total of 14 cases have never been immunised against measles, 2 were
partially immunised, and 7 are reported to be fully immunised. No
vaccination history is yet available for a further 2 cases and we are
unable to confirm the immunisation status of a 20-year-old confirmed
case who was born outside New Zealand.

Of the 7 cases reported to have been fully immunised, 2 have been
serologically confirmed to date and we are awaiting results on 4. One
immunised case has refused to be tested. Further investigation of the
vaccination details of all these cases are being sought. To date,
there is no commonality around the dates of vaccination of these cases
and 4 separate MMR batches have been identified. 3 of the cases were
vaccinated from the same batch, but 2 of these are siblings.

Measles virus isolates from early cases in this outbreak have been
sent to the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory (VIDRL)
in Melbourne for typing.

In New Zealand, MMR vaccine is given as part of the national childhood
immunisation schedule at 15 months and 4 years. It is licensed for use
in infants down to 6 months of age but is not funded except as part of
the national immunisation schedule [above].

[Dr. Brunton has indicated that the previous brief report was a
combination of a Public Health Service press release and some creative
sub-editing by a journalist. ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Brunton for
providing this clarification and we take the opportunity to pass on
the Alert Notice to travellers in the area to ensure that they are
adequately protected against measles virus infection.
