Potomac horse fever was confirmed in 2 horses in Lewis County, Washington, according to the attending veterinarian.

Two horses were confirmed at a private facility. One was a 17-year-old quarter horse gelding having onset of clinical signs on 28 Oct 2020, including diarrhea, inappetence, and weight loss. The horse was confirmed with Potomac horse fever on 7 Nov 2020 and is recovering.

[Potomac horse fever has several names. Other names for the disease include equine monocytic ehrlichiosis, equine ehrlichial colitis, acute equine diarrhea syndrome, and _Neorickettsia risticii_. Perhaps the most common name is Potomac horse fever.

"Potomac horse fever (PHF) is a non-contagious, infectious equine disease caused by the rickettsial organism _N. risticii_ (previously known as _Ehrlichia risticii_). The disease can affect any age, breed, or sex of horse. PHF cases usually occur in summer and fall, but may occur in any season depending on weather conditions.

"Clinical signs
--------------
They are highly variable and include:
- High fever to 107 deg F (41.6 deg C) reported. Fevers may occur 7-14 days before signs of colitis develop
- Diarrhea: variable, ranging from absent to severe
- Depression
- Anorexia
- Lethargy
- Laminitis (with or without diarrhea) may progress from mild to severe
- Mild to moderate colic
- Decreased gastrointestinal sounds
- Edema of limbs and ventral body, and the prepuce of males
- Abortion (by transplacental transmission)
Note: concurrent infections with _Salmonella_ have been documented.

"Incubation period
------------------
Approximately 1-3 weeks.

"Risk factors
-------------
- Housing near (within approximately 5 miles [8 km]) a freshwater stream, or river, or on irrigated pasture in endemic areas
- Nighttime use of barn lights which attract parasitized insects

"Transmission
-------------
- Oral ingestion of trematodes present in aquatic insects (caddisflies, mayflies, damselflies, and dragonflies)
- Whole blood transfusion from an infected donor
- Transplacental (across the placenta to the foal)
- Exposure to freshwater or operculate snails (Note: Affected horses are not considered to be contagious by natural contact with other horses.)

Confirmed PHF cases are not considered to be contagious. The organism is not known to be free in the environment but is instead harbored by certain aquatic insects and snails.

Diagnosis
---------
May be made by PCR [polymerase chain reaction] or IFA [immunofluorescent assay], depending on what type of sample is submitted to the testing laboratory.

"Post-mortem
-----------
Gross necropsy findings in the acute stage of PHF disease include:
- Distended large colon and cecum filled with watery contents
- Mucosal hyperemia and ulceration (may be widespread)
- Hyperplasia of lymphoid follicles and lymph nodes
Aborted fetus lesions include:
- Increased content within the small and large intestine
- Hepatic discoloration

"Submission of tissues for microscopic examination is indicated to facilitate a definitive diagnosis.

"Specific control measures
-------------------------
Routine isolation and disinfection guidelines should be followed, including appropriate disposal of manure.

"In situations where insect attraction has occurred fouling horse feed and water, keep barn lights off where practical to discourage insect travel from water habitats.

Release of animals from isolation
---------------------------------
- Any diarrheic horse should be isolated until the cause can be established
- Co-infection with additional contagious agents is possible in _N. risticii_-infected horses, therefore a comprehensive fecal diagnostic investigation should be undertaken.
- If PHF is proven to be the only cause of the observed illness, isolation protocols can be relaxed as it is not considered a contagious disease.

Biosecurity issues for receiving animals:
-----------------------------------------
Diarrheic horses should be isolated as a matter of routine until contagious causes can be ruled out and normal feces are produced."
