Bacterial Spot of Tomato and Pepper Caused by _Xanthomonas
axonopodis_ pv. _vesicatoria_ in the Western Mediterranean Region of
Turkey.

and E. R. Dickstein, University of Florida, Department of Plant
Pathology, Gainesville 32611. Plant Dis. 88:85, 2004; published
on-line as D-2003-1112-01N, 2004. Accepted for publication 22 Oct
2003.
_Xanthomonas axonopodis_ pv. _vesicatoria_, causal agent of bacterial
spot of tomato (_Lycopersicon esculentum_ L.) and sweet pepper
(_Capsicum annuum_ L.), was isolated from tomato and pepper plants in
greenhouse production in the Province of Antalya, in southwestern
Turkey.
Disease incidence was less than 4 percent of plants observed in 2001
and ranged from 1 to 20 percent in 2002. 11 seedling-producing
companies and 26 greenhouses that produce tomato and pepper were
surveyed during the rainy seasons of 2001 and 2002. The increase in
disease incidence in 2002 is an indication that this disease is
becoming more prevalent on tomato and pepper plants grown in
greenhouses in southwestern Turkey.
A gram-negative bacterium producing yellow-pigmented colonies on
nutrient agar was consistently isolated from brown, circular spots on
leaflets of tomato and sweet pepper seedlings.
5 isolates were pathogenic on commercial cultivars of tomato and
pepper when bacterial suspensions (100 million CFU/ml) were
infiltrated into the intercellular spaces of leaves to determine race
by using procedures described by Bouzar et al. (1). All the isolates
produced hypersensitive reaction responses on tomato genotype cv.
Hawaii 7998 and pepper genotype cvs. 20 R and 30 R and were
designated tomato race 1 pepper race 1 (T1P1) (1).
Fatty acid analysis of the strains identified them as _X. axonopodis
vesicatoria_ with similarity index values of 0.872 to 0.933. In
addition, the strains were tested with _X. axonopodis
vesicatoria_-specific polymerase chain reaction primers (RST 2/3 and
RST 9/10) (2). The isolates were determined to be _X. axonopodis
vesicatoria_.
Although bacterial spot of tomato has been suspected in Turkey for a
number of years, to our knowledge, this is the first report of the
bacterium on tomato.

[_Xanthomonas axonopodis_ pv. _vesicatoria_ [Xav] has been in Turkey
for some time. Long-distance spread of the pathogen in the country is
likely, mainly by movement of infected or infested tomato seed. The
fact that Xav has infected tomato may be the consequence of
environmental conditions. Xav is comprised of strains (races) that
infect only pepper or tomato, or both crops. - Mod.DH]
