2001 Cereal Rust Bulletin #6 June 20, 2001 [extract
Wheat stripe rust is widespread from South Dakota to Indiana.

[The major development in this report is that wheat stripe rust is
extensive from east central South Dakota to northeastern Indiana and
severities ranged from traces to 80 [percent on flag leaves. The past 2
years have seen the most widely dispersed stripe rust development
observed throughout the northern winter wheat area in at least 40 years.
In many of the northern locations rust severities ranged from trace to
10 [percent and the pustules were large and producing spores.
If conditions stay cool and moist the rust should continue to increase.
Obviously, temperature and moisture conditions will affect stripe rust
development. In contrast to last year, stripe rust and leaf rust have not
been found together on the same leaves, which probably indicates they
did not develop from the same spore shower. Much of this stripe rust
development originated from spores produced farther south in Texas,
Oklahoma, Kansas or adjacent states.
