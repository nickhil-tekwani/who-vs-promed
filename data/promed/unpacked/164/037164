Summary information about the anthrax case in Sweden
----------------------------------------------------
The herd is a small beef herd with some 45 animals. The animals are kept in
doors on deep straw bedding and fed only hay of very high quality. It is an
organic farm and no feed ingredients are imported. The animals were brought
in from pasture in the beginning of November 2008 and about some 3 weeks
later the 1st animal died. During the following week another 4 animals died
and on 5 Dec 2008 the field veterinarian contacted the National Veterinary
Institute (SVA) for consultation. There had been logistic problems getting
the carcasses to the local laboratory for post mortem examination and the
veterinarian had opened one carcass on the farm without detecting any
specific signs.

Anthrax was considered as a differential diagnosis already at this point,
but other causes were regarded as more likely after detailed discussions
and it was recommended to ensure that fresh carcasses and/or samples were
brought for laboratory examination as soon as possible. The following week
samples were examined at the SVA with no detection of bacterial growth or
any specific histological lesions. One carcass arrived at the regional
laboratory on Monday but had been transported since the previous week and
was too decomposed for any macroscopic examination. Bacterial culture from
a spleen swab was overgrown with contaminating flora and did not reveal any
specific growth.

On 10 Dec 2008, 3 carcasses from animals that had died during the night
were transported directly to the regional laboratory. The macroscopic
examination of the 1st animal gave rise to a suspicion of anthrax and
samples (blood) from all 3 animals were sent by courier to the SVA. The
herd was immediately put under restrictions. The samples arrived at the SVA
on the following morning and direct smears supported the suspicion but were
not conclusive. Further analysis by culture and PCR was initiated and on 12
Dec 2008 the diagnosis was confirmed. Future activities include
incineration of contaminated carcasses, penicillin treatment of all
remaining animals and investigations to find the possible source of the
infection. All people that may have been exposed to the infection have been
put on antibiotics.

Every year about 5-10 of suspected anthrax cases are examined in Sweden.
The unfortunate delay of one week in the diagnosis of this case is perhaps
not surprising as it has now been 27 years since our last case and numerous
investigations with negative results have been added to our experience.
This case (many peracute cases in cattle indoors fed only local hay) is not
what we expected most in our contingency planning.

[Our thanks to Dr Lewerin for this quick and informed update on this
outbreak. We look forward to hearing the outcome of their further
investigations as to the origin. A puzzler. - Mod.MHJ}
