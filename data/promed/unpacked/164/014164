Veterinary Scientists Shore Up Defenses Against Bird Flu
--------------------------------------------------
It took just a few years for avian influenza to move from a
veterinary backwater into the global spotlight. Now researchers are
trying hard to catch up. At a meeting here [Paris] last week, more
than 200 bird flu scientists called for more aggressive research and
control efforts -- from improved surveillance to finding more humane
ways of killing birds. They also launched a new international lab
network to coordinate research and share virus strains.
Asia's lethal H5N1 is grabbing most of the headlines, but it is not
the only strain of so-called highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)
on the march worldwide. There have been 15 known outbreaks of HPAI
between 2000 and 2004, which killed or led to the culling of some 200
million birds, Ilaria Capua of the Istituto Zooprofilattico
Sperimentale della Venezie in Italy said at the meeting. In the 40
years before, she said, there were just 18 outbreaks, affecting 23
million birds: "We've gone from a few snowflakes to an avalanche."
Several strains other than H5N1 -- including H9N2 in China and Hong
Kong, H7N2 in the United States, H7N3 in Canada, and H7N7 in the
Netherlands -- have also caused human infection, disease, or even
death.
Researchers aren't exactly sure what triggered the change or how big
a threat it poses to humans. That's why meeting participants called
for more funding to study the panoply of strains. Most also welcomed
a new network, proposed by the meeting organizers, the World
Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and the Food and Agricultural
Organization [FAO] of the United Nations. Mirroring a similar network
for human influenza, the new structure, dubbed OFFLU, would pool
veterinary expertise, stimulate closer collaboration with human flu
researchers, and facilitate the exchange of samples -- often a thorny
issue because of intellectual property concerns, says Capua, whose
lab will host the network's secretariat for the first 3 years.
"It's a great idea, if they can get it to work," says Nancy Cox,
chief flu scientist at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia.
Other changes are afoot to limit the spread of avian influenza as
well. OIE has proposed that countries be required to search for and
report outbreaks of low-pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) as well
as its higher-pathogenicity kin. LPAI outbreaks cause little
mortality and are easy to miss, says OIE's Alejandro Thiermann -- but
they can evolve to become HPAI.
At the same time, OIE plans to introduce a new strategy called
"compartmentalization" that could help protect international trade
during an outbreak. Currently, entire regions or countries are shut
off from the international market when they have bird flu. In the
future, parts of the poultry industry could keep their disease-free
status if they can show that their entire operation -- including, for
instance, feed supply, farm workers, and vets -- operate within a
biosafe "compartment" out of reach from the virus. Thiermann hopes
the measure, which will be formally discussed by OIE's 167 member
countries next month, will spur investment in flu-proof poultry
facilities.

[The 73rd General (annual) Session of the OIE is due in Paris 22-27
May 2005. The 167 member countries will be represented in the
assembly, defined as "The International Committee", by their
permanent delegates, in most cases being the countries' Chief
Veterinary Officers.
This year the assembly will discuss significant modifications in
OIE's International Terrestrial Animal Health Code; as indicated in
the above article, they include proposed, important changes in
chapter 2.7.12, addressing Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza. The
basic change relates to the definition of the disease; notifiable
avian influenza (NAI) will be defined as an infection of poultry
caused by any influenza A virus of the H5 or H7 subtypes or by any AI
virus with an intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) greater than 1.2
(or as an alternative at least 75 percent mortality in 4-to
8-week-old chickens infected intravenously).
NAI viruses can be divided into highly pathogenic notifiable avian
influenza (HPNAI) and low-pathogenicity notifiable avian influenza
(LPNAI). Both will be notifiable to the OIE, whereas until now only
Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), caused by any AI subtype,
was notifiable. The new, proposed code articles 2.7.12.5 to
2.7.12.29, which also address the new definition of "compartment" and
all relevant requirements for international trade in avians and their
products, have been included last year in the Code as "under study";
they can be seen at

HPNAI and LPNAI are discussed in the references. - Mod.AS]
