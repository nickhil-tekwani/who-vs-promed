[This brings the total cases in Glasgow & Clyde to 9, of whom 5 have
died. As these 2 cases have only just been reported, it would seem
that one may have been found when moribund. - Mod.MHJ]

International alert in Scottish anthrax probe
---------------------------------------------
An alert has gone out across Europe after a German heroin addict died
from an anthrax infection similar to the one that has killed 7 Scots.
Scottish police and health officials are assisting the German
authorities with their investigation into the man's death and are
also working with European agencies to share intelligence they've
gathered during the recent outbreak.

Detective superintendent Derek Robertson of Strathclyde Police is
leading the investigation in Scotland and has been liaising with his
European counterparts. He said: "An anthrax outbreak is a rare
occurrence, so when we heard of a case in Germany, we immediately
contacted the police." Since then, Strathclyde Police have shared
information ranging from risk-assessment advice to post-mortem
guidance aimed at making sure anthrax cases do not go undetected.

The German man died on [13 Dec 2009], which corresponds with the 1st
anthrax death in Scotland. Since then, Scottish police have
identified several "pulses" of deaths among drug users.

Scientists at Porton Down, a government-run testing facility, are
analysing the anthrax that killed the German man to determine whether
there is a link between the Scottish and central European strains of
the bacterium.

The rising death toll has prompted an intense investigation by
Strathclyde Police and other forces around Scotland. They are seeking
information from those familiar with the drugs market and urged
anyone with any information about contaminated heroin to get in touch
with police. Mr Robertson insisted: "It's not about locking them up,
it's about getting the key piece of evidence that will unlock where
the contaminant is."

Dr Colin Ramsay, consultant epidemiologist at Health Protection
Scotland, has led conferences with the European Centre for Disease
Control to make sure that countries know about the threat that could
be facing them. He said: "It has to be noted that this is the most
significant outbreak there has been for quite some time. In fact,
there has never been an anthrax infection of this scale among
intravenous drug users. "There is major interest in the Scottish
outbreak in both Europe and America, because of the unique nature of
this case."

[The key bits of news here are that there is now collaborative
surveillance across Europe for new cases and what that might aid in
the investigation. And secondly that the German government has
provided DSTL (Defence Science and Technology Laboratory) Porton with
a culture of their isolate for genomic analysis and comparison. This
is not to say that the Germans could not do it as they routinely use
the now standard 25 primer analysis.

The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), which
monitors health in the European Union, said investigations so far
"strongly" suggested that all the cases had been infected by a common
source, but said the heroin was unlikely to have been deliberately
contaminated. "Accidental contamination seems the most plausible
explanation to these incidents," it said. See
