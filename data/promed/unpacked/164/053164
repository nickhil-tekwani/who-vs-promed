Officials from the California Department of Food and Agriculture were cited
as saying today that extensive testing has determined that botulism is
responsible for the deaths of 430 cows at a Modesto dairy this month, after
being traced to a cat carcass that had decomposed on and into a 1,500-pound
hay bale that was mixed with other feed materials and given to cows at the
Genasci Brothers Dairy.
Investigators haven't determined what killed the cat, but parts of the
carcass recovered from feeding bunks tested positive for the botulinum toxin.
Officials say 430 of the 440 cows exposed to the feed died in the past 2-1/2
weeks after showing symptoms, including paralysis of the tongue. The
remaining 10 cows appear healthy but are under close observation. Milk from
the affected cows was destroyed as a precaution, and state investigators say
there's no risk to the public.
The California Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory System confirmed the
presence of botulism Type C and eliminated other likely causes of death.
