The Indiana State Board of Animal Health (BOAH) has been notified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary Services Laboratory that poultry from a commercial turkey farm in Dubois County has tested positive for highly pathogenic H7N8 avian influenza.

Avian influenza does not present a food safety risk; poultry and eggs are safe to eat. The Centers for Disease Control considers the risk of illness to humans to be very low.

A company veterinarian delivered samples from the flock to the laboratory for testing, after several hundred birds died.

"This finding of highly pathogenic H7N8 is unique to Indiana and the nation," said Indiana State Veterinarian Bret D. Marsh, DVM. "This strain is unrelated to those identified in the Upper Midwest in 2015, nor is it related to the HPAI case identified in a Northeastern Indiana backyard poultry flock that was affected last May [2015]."

Indiana Governor Mike Pence stated: "Indiana is one of the largest poultry states in America, and I have directed all relevant agencies to bring the full resources of the state of Indiana to bear on containing and resolving the issue as quickly as possible. Multiple state agencies have been heavily focused for nearly a year on the necessary steps in this type of event, including the State Board of Animal Health, Indiana State Department of Agriculture, Indiana Department of Homeland Security, Indiana Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, Indiana Department of Environmental Management, Indiana State Poultry Association, and several private sector partners. Hoosiers can be assured that we are taking all precautions to contain the situation and minimize the effects to Indiana's robust poultry industry."

Indiana's poultry industry ranks 4th nationally in turkey production, 1st in duck production, 3rd in eggs, and is a significant producer of broiler chickens. The poultry industry employs more than 14 000 people and is valued at USD 2.5 billion.

Backyard poultry owners are encouraged to be aware of the signs of avian influenza and report illness and/or death to the USDA Healthy Birds Hotline: 866-536-7593. Callers will be routed to a state or federal veterinarian in Indiana for a case assessment. Dead birds should be double-bagged and refrigerated for possible testing.

Signs include: sudden death without clinical signs; lack of energy or appetite; decreased egg production; soft-shelled or misshapen eggs; swelling or purple discoloration of head, eyelids, comb, hocks; nasal discharge; coughing; sneezing; incoordination; and diarrhea. A great resource for backyard bird health information is online at: http://www.healthybirds.aphis.usda.gov.

Situation updates and status reports about ongoing avian influenza activities, along with critical disease-related information, will be posted online at: http://www.in.gov/boah/2390.htm. Users may subscribe to email updates on a link at that page.

This marks the 1st case of HPAI in Indiana in 2016. While the disease was found on 219 sites in 16 states in the United States last year [2015], Indiana had only one backyard flock of 76 birds affected in 2015. This event marks the 1st case in a commercial flock in Indiana.

The United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has confirmed the presence of highly pathogenic H7N8 avian influenza (HPAI) in a commercial turkey flock in Dubois County, Indiana. This is a different strain of HPAI than the strains that caused the 2015 outbreak. There are no known cases of H7N8 infections in humans. As a reminder, the proper handling and cooking of poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 F [74 C] kills bacteria and viruses, including HPAI.

Samples from the turkey flock, which experienced increased mortality, were tested at the Indiana Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory at Purdue University, which is a part of USDA's National Animal Health Laboratory Network, and confirmed by USDA this morning [16 Jan 2016]. APHIS is working closely with the Indiana State Board of Animal Health on a joint incident response. State officials quarantined the affected premises, and depopulation of birds on the premises has already begun. Depopulation prevents the spread of the disease. Birds from the flock will not enter the food system.

As part of existing avian influenza response plans, Federal and State partners are working jointly on additional surveillance and testing in the nearby area. The rapid testing and response in this incident is the result of months of planning with local, state, federal and industry partners to ensure the most efficient and effective coordination. Since the previous HPAI detections in 2015, APHIS and its state and industry partners have learned valuable lessons to help implement stronger preparedness and response capabilities. In September 2015, APHIS published a HPAI Fall Preparedness and Response Plan that captures the results of this planning effort, organizing information on preparatory activities, policy decisions and updated strategy documents.

The United States has the strongest AI surveillance program in the world, and USDA is working with its partners to actively look for the disease in commercial poultry operations, live bird markets and in migratory wild bird populations.

Anyone involved with poultry production, from the small backyard to the large commercial producer, should review their biosecurity activities to assure the health of their birds. To facilitate such a review, a biosecurity self-assessment and educational materials can be found at http://www.uspoultry.org/animal_husbandry/intro.cfm.

In addition to practicing good biosecurity, all bird owners should prevent contact between their birds and wild birds and report sick birds or unusual bird deaths to State/Federal officials, either through their state veterinarian or through USDA's toll-free number at 1-866-536-7593. Additional information on biosecurity for backyard flocks can be found at http://healthybirds.aphis.usda.gov.

Avian influenza (AI) is caused by an influenza type A virus, which can infect poultry (such as chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quail, domestic ducks, geese and guinea fowl) and is carried by free flying waterfowl such as ducks, geese and shorebirds. AI viruses are classified by a combination of 2 groups of proteins:

- hemagglutinin or "H" proteins, of which there are 16 (H1-H16), and
- neuraminidase or "N" proteins, of which there are 9 (N1-N9).

Many different combinations of "H" and "N" proteins are possible. Each combination is considered a different subtype and can be further broken down into different strains. AI viruses are further classified by their pathogenicity (low or high) the ability of a particular virus strain to produce disease in domestic chickens.

[While this is sad news for the producer, for the state, and for the nation, it is not totally unexpected; it marks the 1st of what could be a long season for avian influenza.

The USDA had put out several warnings that this was possible and for producers and veterinarians to be alert for early signs of the disease. Sadly, we now have the disease back with us. Hopefully, it will be fully contained and not spread as it did last year (2015). - Mod.TG
