For more information, go to the Michigan Department of Natural Resources,
Wildlife Division, Rose Lake Wildlife Disease Laboratory's "Bovine
Tuberculosis in Michigan" home page:
<http://www.dnr.state.mi.us/wildlife/division/roselake/bovinetb>
It was last updated on 7/3/98 and contains: wildlife and livestock
summaries, articles, links to new releases and MDNR and MDA commission
minutes, many photos of bovine tuberculosis. Soon to be added is a section
devoted to bovine TB in cattle and captive deer. All carnivores are
examined at Michigan State University's Animal Health Diagnostic Lab for
gross lesions and all lymph nodes in the entire carcass of every specimen
are collected and submitted to the National Veterinary Services Lab (NVSL)
at Ames, Iowa where they are cultured for _M. bovis_. If there is growth on
culture, they go on to do genetic testing and identify the bacteria to
species. "Test Positive" means positive to species. The wild deer and
carnivores are submitted dead and do not undergo skin testing.
All results are not yet in for the carnivores. Keep checking our web site
for information expected soon on the DNA fingerprinting of the deer,
coyotes, raccoons and cow.
Again, there is much more information on our web site, and I encourage you
to look at our wildlife disease manual and other wildlife disease
information on the Rose Lake homepage at:

[I looked at their websites and they are very nice. I abstracted the
following two paragraphs from their www report on _M. bovis_ in coyotes &
raccoons:
"Wildlife species selected for inclusion in the study (which is ongoing)
were those carnivorous or omnivorous mammalian species present in the
5-county area where deer were found with bovine TB and whose population
density was sufficient to allow collection. Species included in this survey
were the opossum, raccoon, coyote, red fox, bobcat and badger. To date, 122
animals have been tested with five coyotes and two raccoons infected with
the bovine TB organism (_Mycobacterium bovis_).

The first three TB-positive Michigan coyotes and the first raccoon showed
no gross or microscopic lesions in their organs or lymph nodes. The fourth
coyote had dozens of 2 to 3mm diameter nodules in the lungs and an
enlarged, mottled mesenteric lymph node. The pathologist who performed the
necropsy felt that these lesions were not consistent with tuberculosis. His
feeling was that the lung lesions were due to a reaction from parasites
(roundworm migration through lungs). The fifth coyote had enlarged
mesenteric lymph nodes. The second raccoon had microscopic lesions in the
cranial lymph nodes that were consistent with bovine TB. The raccoon had
been eviscerated so the abdominal organs and lymph nodes were unavailable
for examination."
There is no description of how these "122 animals" were collected. I
suspect that they might have been a mixture of random hunter and trapper
kills ... see the comment about the eviscerated second raccoon. Also the
three coyotes and one raccoon that were lesion-negative AND
histology-negative, were they positive on culture? Presumably. And is this
adequate proof of "infection"? Is merely proving the presence of _M. bovis_
proof of infection? Maybe. Might we have some informed guidance on this
point. - Mod.MHJ
