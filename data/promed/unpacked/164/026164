Coronavirus infections
Update on Robert Koch Institute (RKI) risk assessment on disease from the novel coronavirus (HCoV-EMC)
---------------
2nd case imported to Germany:
A patient hospitalized in Munich since [19 Mar 2013] was confirmed as having an infection with the novel coronavirus [nCoV] on [23 Mar 2013]. The man had been in a hospital in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, and was [transferred] to Germany. The patient is being treated in intensive care. The contact investigation is being conducted by the health department in Munich, and all contacts have been informed. This is the 2nd case of disease [caused by the nCoV] imported to Germany. The 1st patient was transferred to Germany on [24 Oct 2012] for treatment and has recovered (see further information of the City of Munich for the 2nd imported case into Germany).

Information on all confirmed cases are summarized in a table (see below)

On the background of a possible human-to-human transmission:
The 1st possible cluster of cases was reported in a family in Saudi Arabia in 2012. In this family, 2 males were infected, there was a short period of unprotected contact involved in the care of the 1st patient which may be considered as a possible source of transmission.

In February 2013 the last 3 reported cases from the UK had been confirmed. This affected a patient ["the index case"] who prior to his illness had visited Saudi Arabia, and 2 family members of the index patient. One of the family members died, the other was diagnosed with milder respiratory symptoms and recovered quickly.

Risk assessment:
There is still no evidence of continuous human-to-human transmission. In Germany, there have been only 2 imported cases of [nCoV associated illness]. There is no increased risk of disease in the general population.

The care of probable cases in the hospital shall continue to include strict measures according to recommendations for diseases caused by the SARS CoV, because of the severe course of these diseases. This recommendation also is for individuals to avoid contact with sick persons with a history of travel to the Arabian Peninsula.

The Robert Koch Institute has differential diagnostic laboratory tests (see case definition of the RKI of [12 Dec 2012]). The specific diagnosis of novel coronavirus has been established at the Robert Koch Institute and the Institute of Virology at the University of Bonn (see also notes the RKI for laboratory diagnostics).

[2] Germany ex UAE, Saudi Arabia - CIDRAP

Germany, Saudi Arabia report new novel coronavirus cases
-----------------
The German media and Saudi Arabia's health ministry have reported 2 new novel coronavirus (NCoV) cases, one in a patient hospitalized in Munich and the other a mild illness in a Saudi Arabian resident.

According to an early report today [25 Mar 2013] in German from Abendzeitung, a news source based in Munich, the German patient arrived in Germany from the Middle East by medical transport. It says the patient is in isolation in the intensive care unit (ICU) at Munich Municipal Hospital.

The patient is a 73-year-old man from the United Arab Emirates who was 1st treated in an Abu Dhabi hospital on [19 Mar 2013], another German news source, TZ Online, reported today [25 Mar 2013]. It said medical authorities are monitoring about 50 people who had contact with the patient.

The case appears to be Germany's 2nd NCoV case. In October [2012] a Qatari man was hospitalized and treated in Germany but has since recovered. The man's NCoV infection wasn't detected until almost a month after he was hospitalized, and so far no evidence of infection has been found in any of that case-patient's German contacts.

Saudi Arabia's health ministry said its new case is a contact of a 39-year-old man who died in early March [2013] from the disease in that country, according to a [23 Mar 2013] World Health Organization (WHO) statement [see prior ProMED-mail report on this case Novel coronavirus - Eastern Mediterranean (12): KSA, UK fatality, RFI 20130323.1600113]. The patient had a mild illness, recovered, and has been discharged from the hospital. It said there isn't enough information to allow a conclusive assessment of the mode and source of transmission.

The WHO provided no other details about the patient's NCoV infection. However, Ziad Al-Memish, undersecretary with the health ministry, said the patient is from Riyadh, Arab News, an English-language newspaper based in Jeddah, reported yesterday [24 Mar 2013]. He added that the ministry has taken prevention measures and is monitoring the disease.

The latest infection in Saudi Arabia appears to represent yet another instance of a mild illness in a person who had contact with another infected patient. Though the disease has been fatal for many patients infected with NCoV, the emergence of mild cases has raised questions about surveillance for the disease and whether people with asymptomatic or mild disease could be playing a role in the spread of the virus.

In a related development, the index patient in a recent 3-case British family cluster has died, according to a [23 Mar 2013] Birmingham Mail report. The man died at Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester on [19 Mar 2013], and his body has been taken to Pakistan for burial. The 60-year-old man got sick at the end of January [2012] after traveling to Pakistan and Saudi Arabia and has remained hospitalized.

The Saudi Arabian case pushes the number of WHO-confirmed NCoV cases to 16, and the UK death raises the fatality count to 10. That count does not include Germany's new case.

The 2nd patient sickened in the UK family cluster was a 38-year-old male household contact who died on [17 Feb 2013]. The Birmingham Mail report said he was the older man's son. The 3rd patient is a 30-year-old woman from a different household who got sick with a mild NCoV infection after visiting the older man 3 times in the hospital.

Two other clusters have been reported among the NCoV cases, but few details are known. One involved 3 members of one Saudi family and the other included 2 Jordanian deaths that were part of a cluster linked to a hospital ICU.

In other coronavirus developments, though NCoV doesn't appear to spread easily from person-to-person so far, some infectious disease experts aren't ruling out the possibility that "superspreaders" could contract the virus and contribute to a more global outbreak, much the way SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) spread 10 years ago, the Canadian Press (CP) reported today. [for the full article discussing the possibility of "superspreaders", see the article by Helen Branswell, available at http://ca.news.yahoo.com/superspreaders-could-turn-coronavirus-sars-event-experts-154819467.html. - Mod.MPP]

Ron Fouchier, PhD, told the CP that the current transmission patter could change quickly if an NCoV superspreader were hospitalized in a facility that didn't recognize the disease and take precautions. The CP story noted that during the SARS epidemic only a few people infected a fair number more, which uncovered the disease and sparked global panic.

Donald Low, MD, a microbiologist from Toronto who played a key role in Canada's response to SARS, told the CP that it's impossible to predict the spread of NCoV, because coronaviruses are RNA viruses, which are known for mutating rapidly.

In the Schwabing [Hospital] isolation ward, doctors fight for the life of an Arab, who is seriously ill with the dangerous coronavirus. 50 people [in Munich], who had contact with him are now being observed.

The virus appears not to be extremely contagious - but is extremely deadly: Worldwide only 16 infections with the new coronavirus are known, [of which] 9 patients died [there was a 10th death that occurred last week. - Mod.MPP]. Now a man in Munich is in danger. The health authorities are monitoring around 50 people in the city, who had contact with the patient. For the population no risk of infection had passed.

The patient lies in the Schwabing Hospital in an isolation room in the ICU. "The condition is clinically critical," said the chief of infectious diseases Clemens Wendtner. The patient is on a ventilator [assisted breathing].

Not much information is available on the patient due to privacy concerns. The 73-year-old comes from the United Arab Emirates, so far all of the cases of nCoV have occurred on the [Arabian] Peninsula. [Of the 16 confirmed cases, there were 2 in Jordan and 2 cases in the UK. These latter 2 cases were contacts of a 3rd case in the UK who had traveled to Pakistan and Saudi Arabia during the incubation period for the infection. - Mod.MPP] This current case was admitted to a hospital in Abu Dhabi on [10 Mar 2013]. Last Tuesday [19 Mar 2013], he arrived in Germany by private jet for treatment. At the time of arrival, the etiology of his illness was not known and he was on mechanical ventilation. He was taken by an intensive care ambulance to Schwabing. The doctors quickly classified this as a serious infection and placed him in isolation. On Saturday [24 Mar 2013] the laboratory sent an alarm: the novel human coronavirus Beta 2c EMC/2012 was identified.

At present, while little is known of this pathogen, the World Health Organization has warned over the past 6 months that the virus belongs to the same family as the SARS virus. "The risk of infection is not the same but," says Prof. Wendtner, patients are therefore not in the highest category as for Ebola and SARS isolation, but in the 2nd highest. "But the mortality rate is very high among those affected."

According to recent studies, the disease could transmitted in the Middle East from animals to humans -- possibly via contact with dust particles contaminated with dried bat excrement, or through direct contact with it.

Whether and how the virus is transmitted from person to person is not clear: In the 1st case in Germany in the fall of 2012 there was no further infection [among contacts]. A 45-year-old from Qatar had been treated from Qatar [in Germany] and recovered. Recently, however, a Briton was infected in Pakistan or Saudi Arabia. After returning 2 younger family members were infected [through presumed contact with this patient] and his 38-year-old son died.

Therefore, the Munich city health department has approximately 50 people in Munich under observation - especially relatives [of the patient] and hospital staff. To date, these contacts have not been isolated and are not considered to be a great risk. they can move around freely and clinical staff are on duty. They all have to give a blood sample and report daily to the authorities announcing if they experience symptoms. [This is being done as] "A precautionary measure", reassured Prof. Wendtner. The circle [of observation] has been drawn very large on purpose. "So far, no one is showing symptoms."

[The latest case represents the 17th confirmed case of respiratory illness associated with infection with the nCoV. As with previous cases, there is a linkage to presence in the Middle East (or contact with an individual who had been in the Middle East) prior to onset of illness. In this case, the patient was hospitalized in Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) prior to transfer to Germany. Information on travel history of this patient prior to onset of illness is not available at present.

The table available on the RKI website (see section [4] above) is a good summary of the state of knowledge to date on the epidemiology of this disease -- there are many "holes" in the information available on the cases. Of the 17 cases, 14 were in males, 2 in females and one presently not known. 10 cases have died.

The nCoV is most closely related to a previously identified bat coronavirus. The mechanism for the species jump from bat to human has not been defined as yet. Some speculation is that there has been intermediate infection of domestic farm animals in the Middle East, which then in turn infected the humans. Results of studies conducted on bats and animals in the Middle East are still pending.

More information on the epidemiology of these cases to date would be greatly appreciated.
