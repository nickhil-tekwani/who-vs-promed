Several cases of pneumonia have occurred in the Ticino Maggia Valley in recent weeks. Those affected have been infected with Q fever. The situation is, however, under the control of the health authorities.

Q fever is transmitted by a bacterium found in goats. The Ticino health authorities have therefore ordered the vaccination of exposed animals. In addition, the transport of the animals from one farm to another was prohibited.

Infection with goat milk is considered very unlikely. Even from person to person, the disease is not transmitted. Q fever manifests itself with flu-like illnesses, but without a cold or sore throat. In 1-2 percent of cases there are complications.

Q fever is a notifiable disease in Switzerland. Since the beginning of the year [2019] around 50 cases have been reported, 20 of them from Ticino, said Daniel Koch of the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH).

Therefore, there will be an increase this year [2019] compared to the approximately 40 cases that have occurred on average per year since 2012. In 2012, the disease was again declared as notifiable after 17 cases of illness occurred in the canton of Vaud.

According to Koch, the situation is under control, despite the increased occurrence of illnesses in Ticino. The established monitoring system proved its effectiveness. The last time a major epidemic of Q fever occurred in 1983. At that time, more than 400 people fell ill in Valais.

The Italian-speaking canton of Ticino, with a population of 353 709 residents in 2017, is the southernmost canton of Switzerland, which borders Italy's regions of Piedmont and Lombardy to the south; its largest city is Lugano (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canton_of_Ticino). A map showing the location of Ticino can be found at https://goo.gl/maps/BPDnWTfqa2bi1Wxg9.

Q fever is due to _Coxiella burnetii_, an obligate intracellular rickettsia-like bacterial pathogen. It is highly resistant to drying and heat, which enables the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment. Its survival is attributed to a small cell variant of the organism that is part of its biphasic developmental cycle. Q fever is a zoonosis. Although it has a wide and diverse host range, in animals this organism is primarily known as a cause of reproductive losses in domesticated ruminants. Clinical cases seem to be most significant in sheep and goats, with sporadic losses and occasional outbreaks that may affect up to 50-90% of the herd. Infected animals can be difficult to recognize: nonpregnant animals do not seem to have any obvious clinical signs, and seropositivity is not always correlated with shedding of the bacteria. The organism is shed in urine, feces, milk, and especially birthing products; intermittent high-level shedding occurs at the time of parturition, with millions of bacteria being released per gram of placenta.

Humans usually become infected by inhaling aerosolized organisms, often when they are exposed to an animal that had aborted but also if birth was at term and seemed normal. Acute symptoms of a flu-like illness usually develop within 2-3 weeks of exposure, although as many as half of humans infected with _C. burnetii_ do not show symptoms (http://www.cdc.gov/qfever/symptoms/index.html). Although most persons with acute Q fever infection recover, others may experience serious illness with complications that may include pneumonia, granulomatous hepatitis, endocarditis (especially in patients with previous cardiac valvulopathy), myocarditis, and central nervous system involvement. Pregnant women who are infected may be at risk for pre-term delivery or miscarriage.

Q fever is frequently an occupationally acquired illness; people most at risk include workers from the meat and livestock industries, shearers, veterinarians, laboratory personnel performing _C. burnetii_ cultures, as well as the general population in close proximity to infected animals in stockyards, feedlots, processing plants, or farms.

The media report above mentions milk as an unlikely source of human infection, probably relating to pasteurised milk. In fact, _Coxiella_ organisms may be acquired by humans orally from unpasteurized milk or other contaminated material. The importance of tick-borne infections in humans is unclear, although intradermal inoculation was reported to be an efficient route of transmission in human volunteers. See the above and additional information at http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/q_fever.pdf (Updated Nov 2017).

In Australia, immunization is recommended for high-risk occupational groups. However, there is a risk of severe local reactions to the vaccine in those people previously exposed to Q fever or Q fever vaccine. To assess prior exposure, prevaccination serologic screening is necessary. Any positive result on screening precludes Q fever vaccination (https://www2.health.vic.gov.au/public-health/infectious-diseases/disease-information-advice/q-fever).

In the EU, Q fever is a reportable disease: for 2016, 29 countries reported 1102 cases, 1058 (96%) of which were classified as confirmed, and Spain, Germany and France accounted for most of the confirmed cases reported in the 5 years, 2012-2016, with 1130, 873, and 638 confirmed cases, respectively (https://ecdc.europa.eu/sites/portal/files/documents/q-fever-annual-epidemiological-report-2016.pdf).

Switzerland
-----------
The low incidence of Q fever is about 0.15 cases per 100 000 inhabitants, corresponding to around 10-12 infections per year (http://www.bag.admin.ch/dokumentation/publikationen), prompted public health authorities to stop mandatory reporting in 1999, but mandatory reporting of Q fever was resumed in 2012 after a cluster of human cases was detected (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4184577/).

The Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office (https://www.blv.admin.ch/blv/de/home/tiere/tierseuchen/uebersicht-seuchen/alle-tierseuchen/coxiellose-beim-tier-und-q-fieber-beim-mensch.html) mandates:
- Livestock keepers must report any abortion of cattle, sheep, or goats to their vet. When an animal holding experiences more than one abortion within 4 months, abortion-related tissues should also be examined for _C. burnetii_.
- If coxiellosis occurs in a herd of cattle, sheep, or goats, the aborting and the animals in high pregnancy should be separated from the rest of the herd into separate boxes as a precautionary measure. All aborted foeti and afterbirths should be examined, and stables cleaned and disinfected.
- The Swiss veterinary legislation further prescribes the elimination of infected and contaminated animals as conditional to the rehabilitation of the herd. Sheep should be sheared and the wool disposed of. Ruminants in petting zoos are to be regularly tested for _C. burnetii_ and if necessary, removed.
- Exposed occupational groups, which often have close contact with ruminants and their products, should pay attention to the general hygiene measures.

Vaccination of ruminants against coxiellosis is not authorized in Switzerland. However, as reported above, in certain conditions this ban may undergo temporary alleviations. The Swiss may have referred to the lessons learned during the major Dutch Q fever event (2006-2009; see 20100930.3546). - Mods.ML/AS]
