"Lapiwa" Meal Kills 6 Children
------------------------------
Hours after a meal of 'kokonte' (also known aa Lapiwa or Face-the-wall), a
man, his wife and 6 of their children have all died at Tebeso Number 1,
throwing the village in the Amansie East District of Ashanti into a state
of shock. Family members suspect food poisoning.
The 70-year-old man and his family were said to have complained of severe
abdominal pains moments after eating the meal, which was prepared in their
home on Republic Day, 1 Jul 2005. They were rushed to the Bekwai Government
Hospital, where they all died later.
Chief Superintendent Paul Frimpong Siaw, the Ashanti Regional Police Crime
Officer, confirming the story, told the Graphic that it was too early to
suspect any foul play. He indicated that police investigations were being
carried into the matter.

[Lapiwa is a food made from cassava. For unknown reasons, it is said that
people who eat it outside hide from passerbys by facing the
wall. Improperly prepared cassava may cause acute or chronic cyanide
poisoning, although the recently posted cassava poisoning episode in the
Philippines was linked to contaminating pesticide.
Cassava (_Manihot esculenta_, Crantz) is a root crop widely consumed in
Africa and South America. Although it originated in Brazil (where it is
called manioc), it was brought to Africa by Portuguese colonists, and it is
now an important crop there and in Indonesia and Southeast Asia. It is the
principal source of nutrition for about 500 million people. Its leaves are
edible, but the prize is its starchy root, rich in protein, minerals, and
vitamins A, B, and C.
Cassava is used in a vast variety of cakes, snacks, and desserts and grows
wild in many places, being tough and drought-resistant. In a country where
hunger is now a reality for many poor households, cassava is among those
food crops that can make the crucial difference between starvation and
survival. The cassava plant is the world's 3rd most important crop. Cassava
enters the North American diet also -- as it is made into tapioca.
Surprising for an important edible plant, cassava is quite poisonous
without proper preparation. The toxin in cassava is called linamarin. When
eaten raw or inadequately prepared, the human digestive system will convert
this to cyanide. Even 2 cassava roots contain a fatal dose of poison.
While the bitter variety (white cassava) of the plant has larger
concentrations of cyanide than the sweet variety (yellow cassava), the
sweet cassava is not without risk.
To prepare cassava, it is peeled and grated and soaked in warm water for
several days. This allows the cassava's own natural enzyme (linamarase) to
convert the cyanogen linamarin to sugar and cyanide gas, and the volatile
gas disperses usually harmlessly. However, women -- who are usually charged
with processing the plant -- can be sickened by inhaling cyanide gas. What
remains after processing can be boiled and eaten, or more usually, dried
and ground.
The shelf life of a cassava root is quite short once it is removed from the
stem, so there's an urgency to get the food to market. Roots can turn to
mush in less than a week. The rush to get cassava to the market may keep
some batches of cassava from being processed properly.
Chronic, low-level cyanide exposure is associated with the development of
goiter and with tropical ataxic neuropathy, a nerve-damaging disorder that
renders a person unsteady and uncoordinated. Severe cyanide poisoning,
particularly during famines, when there is obviously pressure to process
the cassava more rapidly, is associated with outbreaks of a debilitating,
irreversible paralytic disorder called konzo and, in some cases, death. The
incidence of konzo and tropical ataxic neuropathy can be as high as 3
percent in some areas of Africa.
In an effort to avoid this toxicity, it has been reported by Siritunga and
Sayre (1) that transgenic cassava free of cyanogens can be produced. The
investigators generated transgenic plants in which cytochrome oxidase
enzymes that catalyze the 1st step in linamarin synthesis are inhibited.
The plants showed a 94-percent reduction in leaf linamarin content and a
99-percent decrease in root linamarin levels. Additionally, the same group
(2) has reported that transgenic cassava plants can be produced that
overexpress the gene for hydroxynitrile lyase, facilitating cyanogenesis
during processing and producing a final product with less risk. The tubers
of cassava do not have this enzyme, and processing relies on spontaneous
conversion. Combining these methods could further decrease the risk of
cyanide poisoning from cassava.
The mechanism of rapid deterioration relates to the inevitable traumatic
consequences of harvest. The trauma initiates a chain of events leading to
spoiling, which often precedes invasion by any microorganism. The
phenylpropanoid pathway seems integrally involved in this. Genetic
manipulation of the system may be useful in slowing deterioration.
