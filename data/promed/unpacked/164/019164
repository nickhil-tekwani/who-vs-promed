The Kerala administration has decided to launch 'fever clinics' in
medical institutions, as well as district hospitals, and, if
achievable, in private hospitals, with the aim to fight the spread of
rat fever (leptospirosis) in the Malabar area.

This declaration has been made by Mr Adoor Prakash, minister for
health. After a conference with senior medical functionaries, the
minister stated that medical camps, wherever needed, would be held for
cure as also to create attentiveness regarding the illness amongst the
community. The Indian Medical Association will offer up all necessary
backing for arranging the camps. While explicating the actions being
pioneered to deal with the situation, Mr Adoor stated that that a
drive to clean up the premises and public places would be introduced
with the assistance of charitable groups in addition to educational
institutions. In this connection, a 7 day-long program will take place
from 25 Sep to 2 Oct 2011.

The Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA) workers will also be
deployed in the field to assist the attempts to put control over the
outbreak. A Central group would visit Kerala to review the whole
situation. The Minister added that around 256 suspected cases of rat
fever were found in Kozhikode region, out of which 33 cases were
confirmed. In the same way, 43 fatalities thus far were suspected to
have been caused by the illness, out of which 2 had been confirmed.

[Bacteria of the genus _Leptospira_ cause leptospirosis. More than 200
pathogenic leptospiral serovars, distinguished on the basis of
bacterial surface antigens, have been identified. Different
leptospiral serovars are prevalent in particular geographical regions.
The disease is transmitted to humans from wildlife species, such as
rats, sometimes domestic animals, such as dogs, and livestock, such as
cattle and pigs. When these animals are infected, they may have no or
minimal symptoms of the disease, but develop a renal carrier state
associated with long term urinary shedding. The infection is
transmitted to humans by contact with water, soil, or food
contaminated with the urine of these chronically infected animals.

Outbreaks of leptospirosis are usually associated with exposure to
contaminated floodwater. _Leptospira_ survive for weeks to months in
warm, fresh water or soil flooded with fresh water. The bacteria can
enter the body through skin or mucous membranes, especially if the
skin is broken from a cut or scratch. Drinking contaminated water or
food can also cause infection. Person to person transmission is rare.

The symptoms in humans appear after a 3-14 day incubation period.
Because of the relatively nonspecific nature of the clinical
presentation of leptospirosis, its diagnosis cannot be made
confidently without laboratory confirmation. For further discussion of
leptospirosis, see ProMED-mail post Leptospirosis - India: (KA,KL) 20110709.2079.

Leptospirosis occurs worldwide and frequently follows flooding after
heavy rain. The rainy summer monsoon season begins in Kerala in June
and lasts until the end of September, with flooding every year
(http://www.mapsofindia.com/surat/flood.html).

In a flood-affected area, leptospirosis chemoprophylaxis is
doxycycline 200 mg, once a week for those exposed to contaminated
floodwater or soil. Each 200 mg dose provides a benefit for up to 7
days, so the dose may be repeated if high-risk conditions persist
longer than this.

People exposed in flooded fields should be cautioned against direct
contact with contaminated water or mud and should be advised to use
rubber shoes or boots and gloves. Broken skin should be protected with
a waterproof dressing. All food and drinking water should be protected
against contamination. All drinking water should be boiled unless it
is known to be absolutely safe. Fresh vegetables and fruit should be
washed in clean water and then cooked or peeled. Because rodents are
the major reservoir of _Leptospira interrogans_, rodent control
measures should be undertaken.
