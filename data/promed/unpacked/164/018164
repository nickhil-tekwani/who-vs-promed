Pig farmer Bobby Waugh, aged 55, of Burnside Farm, Birks Road, East
Heddon, Heddon-on-the-Wall, is refusing to talk to the press. He says he
saw nothing wrong with his pigs and a complaint in December that they
were in poor condition had proved groundless.
"There are currently 500 pigs on the farm which I run with my brother
Ronnie who is currently in the hospital recovering from the flu. We have
300 sows and 200 young pigs which are being reared on the farm. All the
pigs we sell go to Cheale Meats in Brentwood, Essex."
"On January 25 this year, we had our routine annual check-up from a
Ministry of Agriculture inspector and a trading standards officer who
gave us a clean bill of health. They checked the pigs for any health
problems and the trading standards officer checked our pig movement
records to ensure everything was in order."
"I feed our pigs twice a day. When they are fed they all get up to eat. I
know when there is a problem with one of them because they don't get up
to feed which I would check out immediately. I always keep a careful eye
on all my pigs because naturally, I want healthy pigs. It is not in my
interest to have unhealthy pigs."
"I honestly hadn't seen anything wrong with any of my pigs in the last
few weeks. How could I report something I didn't see?"
"The first I knew about this outbreak was when the Ministry came to my
farm yesterday. Today they told me there was a confirmed case of Foot and
Mouth Disease (FMD) here and my whole herd will be slaughtered. This is
devastating news, not just for me, but for the whole industry, especially
after the recent crisis we have had to endure in the pig market. I have
no idea where the disease has come from."
"On a different matter, there was a complaint made in December by someone
who said my pigs were in a poor condition. A trading standards officer
and a Ministry vet visited my farm but they found nothing wrong."

[Neighbors had been so disturbed by the state of the farm that spawned
Britain's current Foot & Mouth Disease epidemic in Heddon-on-the Wall,
Northumberland, that they had reported [the conditions to an animal
welfare charity.
The farm was visited on 19 Dec 2000 by trading standards officers and the
Ministry of Agriculture.
Local officials had wanted to prosecute [the owner of the farm but the
Ministry
overruled them and he was told to "get his act together", That warning
did not appear to lead to any action being taken. The consequences of
that neglect were being felt across Britain yesterday as healthy
livestock and careful farmers were penned in by a draconian regime.
Within the last year the farm had been visited 4 times by council
environmental health officers, but they had been unable to find
sufficient evidence to support action being taken.
Yesterday, however, yellow Ministry of Agriculture tape fluttered across
the farm entrance warning visitors off, and posters were nailed on nearby
fence posts telling walkers to keep away.
If ever a stable door had been shut after the horse had bolted it was at
Heddon-on-the-Wall yesterday.

Precautionary slaughtering of 2 in-contact farms in Northumberland and N.
Kent is underway. Kent is an area where wild pigs are present.
Currently 8 farms are now having animals destroyed or are scheduled for
destruction: 6 are confirmed outbreaks and 2 are "dangerous contacts"
(1 in Northumberland and 1 in N. Kent).

French are worried (12pm, Feb 24)
-----------------------
French are worried by the direction of the prevailing wind over Essex
today, which could carry infection to their north-west coastline.
Swill feeding (12pm, Feb 24)
---------------------------
The Waugh brothers farm [suspected Heddon-on-the-Wall index farm is
licensed to swill feed. MAFF officers are visiting Newcastle airport to
investigate the source of waste airline food.
There are less than 140 licensed swill feeders in Britain and they
account for only c.1.6 percent of pig production.

Bad weather and other problems have delayed the on-site incineration of
hundreds of carcasses in Northumberland. Currently, there are no new
cases.

Northeast braced for verdict
------------------------------
A 7-day freeze on livestock movements throughout Britain was imposed last
night in a bid to halt the spread of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD), while
Scottish farmers waited anxiously to learn if the outbreak had spread to
the northeast.
A 5-mile exclusion zone was set up around a farm at Fyvie where animals
showed signs of the disease. The zone will stay in place until the
results of tests are known.
A Scottish Executive spokesman said the results would not be known until
today at the earliest.
Grampian Country Food Group's Banks Farm was cordoned off after pigs on
the farm displayed signs of lameness. [Lameness is one of the signs of
FMD. The blisters and erosions on the feet make walking painful for the
animal. - Mod.TG
It is one of 29 farms across Scotland identified as having a link with
the Essex abattoir at the center of the outbreak. All will be tested.
The National Farmers' Union of Scotland called for all imports of meat to
be banned until the original source of the infection could be determined.
Politicians and industry leaders backed the freeze on animal movements,
and supermarkets denied it would have any short-term impact on meat
supplies. Some retailers warned they might source meat from abroad, while
Safeway said it would increase its fish and poultry stocks in case
consumers lost confidence in meat.
The ban will affect around 200 UK hauliers specializing in live animal
transport.
It was announced as evidence emerged the potent virus was spreading
across Britain. The ban came into force at 5.45pm but will allow journeys
in transit to be completed.
The Government's chief veterinary officer, Jim Scudamore, said the source
of the outbreak was believed to be a farm at Heddon-on-the-Wall,
Northumberland, which regularly delivers live pigs to the Essex
slaughterhouse.
The Government revealed the first pigs to be infected may have been
suffering from FMD for more than 2 weeks before the disease was
discovered.
The North-east scare saw Banks Farm at Fyvie being issued with a Section
A restriction notice by the Scottish Executive Rural Affairs Department.
It also applied to 3 neighboring smaller farms, all part of the Grampian
Country Food Group (GCFG). Disinfected straw was placed at the farm
entrances while police closed minor roads and controlled agricultural
traffic.
GCFG's Alasdair Cox said staff had discovered a number of animals
suffering from lameness and had called in the state veterinary service.
The exclusion zone banning animal movements was set-up around the farm
while tests were carried out. A farmer and an empty livestock lorry were
turned away from Thainstone Market because they had traveled through the
area.
If the tests prove positive, all the animals at Banks Farm will have to
be slaughtered.
But Mr Cox stressed: "At this time the cause of the lameness is being
attributed to the recent weather conditions."
Sows from GCFG, one of Scotland's biggest pig producers, were transported
to the Cheale Meats slaughterhouse.
Pigs are regularly transported from Thainstone by Sauchen-firm Henry
Thomson and Sons to Garstang in Lancashire, where another firm takes them
on to the abattoir. Last night, Mr Thomson confirmed he makes the
deliveries twice weekly.
A spokesman for the Executive said checks were being carried out at all
29 Scottish farms linked to the abattoir.
"The others haven't given us any cause for alarm. This one (Banks Farm)
has given us cause for alarm. The animals have been displaying similar
signs."
Announcing the ban on livestock movements north of the border, Scottish
Rural Development Minister Ross Finnie said it was being imposed
following advice from the chief veterinary officer.
"Freezing movements will enable the state veterinary service to undertake
all the necessary checks and tracings and to prevent any further spread
of the disease," he explained.
Mr Finnie said the Scottish order would stop all movement of susceptible
animals Â– mainly pigs, cattle, sheep and goats. It will not affect the
movement of poultry, milk, or animal feed.
The order reserves to Scottish ministers the power to grant a licence
permitting movements.
He said the state veterinary service was tracing hundreds of lorry
movements to and from the Essex abattoir and a farm in Tyne and Wear. Mr
Finnie added: "At this moment there are no confirmed cases in Scotland
and it is of course my very strong hope this will remain the position."
NFUS president Jim Walker said it was vital imports of meat were
stopped.
Gordon McKen, managing director of Grampian Pig Producers, which
represents 154 pig farmers across the North of Scotland, said he was not
opposed to the 7-day ban. It would not have major financial or animal
welfare implications.
Quality Meat Scotland, which represents producers and retailers,
described the movement ban as a "sensible precaution".
"The Northumberland case is worrying because it means that it is not
confined to Essex.
UK Agriculture Minister Nick Brown, announcing the ban, reiterated
farmers would be compensated for any animals slaughtered to stop the
spread of the disease at 100 percent of their market value. But the Government
would not pay for any consequential losses.

Supermarkets were preparing for the panic buying of meat as the
Government imposed an emergency 7-day ban on the movement of farm
livestock in an attempt to prevent an epidemic of FMD.
British bacon and ham are expected to be first off the shelves. Retailers
fear by the middle of next week shortages will also affect the sandwich
market and many ready-made meals.
Supplies of home-reared beef and lamb are also likely to be affected by
panic-buying, although leading retailers believe they have enough fresh
pork for about a week.
Supermarkets were last night making arrangements to import fresh meat,
particularly from Ireland, and arranging extra bacon and ham supplies
from Denmark and Holland. Martin Paterson, spokesman for the Food and
Drink Federation, which represents the leading food companies said: "No
movement, no slaughter will mean a rapid run-down of industry's meat
supplies."
Nick Brown, the Agriculture Minister, called for calm among consumers.
"There is no need for panic buying in the supermarkets, we are not going
to run out of food," he said. "If everyone just carries on normally then
we will get through this all right."
The emergency ban could be lifted under licence in certain parts of the
country if the food chain was seriously threatened, he said. The decision
would be made by Jim Scudamore, the Government's chief veterinary
officer, and will depend on the incidence of the disease over the next
few days.
There were 6 confirmed cases last night, and Mr Scudamore said a large
number of farmers were reporting possible new cases to be investigated.
Officials are particularly concerned that pigs from the Heddon-in-the-Wall
farm that has been identified as the likely source of the infection could
have been suffering the disease for up to a month. If so, that would
increase the risk of the disease spreading through many parts of rural
Britain.
There is also concern that a spell of severe weather with snow could
prolong the life of the virus in the environment.
A mass slaughter of livestock has been ruled out but Mr Scudamore said
yesterday he would order the culling of livestock on farms likely to be
infected by the disease. Ministers believe draconian action now will
prevent a countrywide crisis and the policy is being backed by farmers
and the agriculture industry.
The Home Office instructed all police forces to keep watch for the
illegal movement of livestock. The ban applies to cattle, pigs, sheep and
goats, but not to horses, poultry, milk, cereal, vegetables or animal
feed. Anyone breaking the ban will face criminal charges and faces a
penalty of up to 5000 BPS plus 1000 BPS for each animal.
Mr Brown last night reiterated his plea for people to stay away from
farms and for any large farm gatherings to be postponed. He has also told
MPs to stop campaigning on farms.

[Type O FMD virus infection has an approximate 36 hour incubation period.
Consequently, by looking at the pathological lesions of the animals first
believed to have been discovered with the disease, the virus may have been
disseminating for 16 days prior.
There were reports of bad weather delaying the incineration of the animals
at the Heddon-on-the Wall index case farm today. Police are standing by to
stop traffic on the nearby A69 road in case of smoke problems.
Incineration of infected carcasses was a significant source of virus
dissemination during the early days of the 1967/68 epidemic, but
presumably more care will be taken this time!
It would be worrisome should the case in Scotland prove to be positive.
This disease can spread easily and rapidly, even being borne many miles on
the wind. France has good reason to be worried and is surely taking
precautions and instituting movement restrictions even now, I hope. - Mod.TG
