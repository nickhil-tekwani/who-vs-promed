Australia: Undiagnosed Cancer Killing Off Tasmanian Devils
----------------------------------------------------------
A mysterious cancer is killing Australasia's Tasmanian devils -- whose
spine-chilling screeches, dark colour, and reputed bad temper prompted
early settlers to give them their chilling name. The world's largest
carnivorous marsupial is the size of a stocky small dog but has jaws as
strong as a crocodile that allow it to eat up to half its body weight in 30
minutes. An adult can weigh up to 12 kg.
Australia's southern island state of Tasmania is [now] the only place where
the animals are found, but they are being affected by a virus-mediated
disease that has cut some population groups by 85 percent. The population
of _Sarcophilus harrisii_ peaked at around 175 000 in 1996 before the
cancer appeared. Now wildlife officials fear the disease could kill 2/3 of
the population by 2006. The affliction has spread widely in eastern and
central Tasmania in 2 years. It causes huge tumours that block the animal's
eyesight, hearing, or mouth, and they starve to death.
"We suspect it is spread by biting when the animals quarrel or mate," said
Nick Mooney, a wildlife biologist with the nature conservation branch of the
state's wildlife department. However, it is unlikely that the cancer will
wipe out the Tasmanian devil, as such diseases often spare a few isolated
animals, which then reproduce to revive the population. "We may find there is
nothing more we can do than isolate parts of the population," Mooney said.

[The evidence for a viral etiology is unclear from this report, but the
description of the disease resembles that of a poxvirus-associated
hyperplasia, such as myxomatosis in rabbits. Further information on the
nature of the disease and its relationship to myxomatosis, if any, would be
welcomed.
Tasmanian devils are restricted to Tasmania, and it is believed they became
extinct on mainland Australia some 600 years ago -- before European
settlement of the continent. The dingo, which was brought into Australia by
Aboriginal people, is believed to have ousted the devil from the mainland.
Tasmanian devils are still common in some north, east, and central districts
of Tasmania, where some farming practices (e.g., rangeland sheep grazing)
provide an abundant source of food. - Mod.CP]
