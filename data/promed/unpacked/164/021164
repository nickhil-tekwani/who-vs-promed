The death toll from an outbreak of [listeriosis] in South Africa has jumped beyond 60 in the past month [December 2017], health authorities said on Monday [8 Jan 2018], adding they had closed a poultry abattoir where the bug that causes the disease had been detected.

Since monitoring of the outbreak began last January [2017], 720 laboratory-confirmed cases of food poisoning due to the disease, also known as listeriosis, have been reported, the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) said.

That was up from 557 in December [2017], since when recorded deaths had risen to 61 from 36 [case fatality rate of 8.5%].

A food microbiologist said the "alarming" outbreak appeared to be the biggest ever recorded and could spread further if it was not tackled urgently. "Of the documented outbreaks globally that we know of ... our numbers are way above any of those other cases," said Dr Lucia Anelich, who runs her own food safety consultancy.

The Department of Health said it had closed a poultry abattoir operated by Sovereign Foods in the capital Pretoria after detecting _Listeria_ there, and had banned it from preparing food. The department said it did not yet know whether this abattoir was the source of the outbreak, which the NICD said was still unknown.

No one at Sovereign Foods, which delisted from the Johannesburg stock exchange in November [2017], was immediately available for comment.

_Listeria_ food poisoning is a bacterial infection that can be treated with antibiotics if diagnosed in time. The bacteria can be found in animal products including cold cut meats, poultry and unpasteurised milk, as well as fresh fruits and vegetables. The disease can cause flu-like symptoms and diarrhoea, and in more severe cases spread from the intestine to the blood, causing bloodstream infections, or to the central nervous system, causing meningitis.

Anelich said a listeriosis strain known as ST6 had been identified in 9 out of 10 of the South African cases. That should make tracing the source easier, "because now we know that it probably originates from one processing facility".

A health department official said the strain was not drug-resistant and that the deaths were due to delays in diagnosis, meaning cases were not treated in time.

In the past month‚ another 167 people have contracted deadly listeriosis‚ bringing the total number of confirmed cases in South Africa to 717.

Food scientists are now calling it the worst documented listeriosis outbreak in global history. In its latest listeriosis update‚ dated 3 Jan 2018‚ the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) -- which has been tracking the listeriosis outbreak for an entire year -- said 61 deaths had been reported.

Listeriosis has a relatively high mortality rate [actually the case fatality rate, not mortality rate], 20-25% compared to illnesses caused by most other food-borne pathogens. Less than 1% of people who get _Salmonella_ or _E. coli_ O157 die as a result. Neonates -- babies less than 28 days old -- remain the most affected by listeriosis.

A prohibition notice has been issued to an abattoir in the Tshwane area halting it from distributing meat after samples taken from it tested positive. The outbreak is across all 9 provinces, and clinical tests have revealed that the _Listeria_ originates from a single source, "most likely a food product on the market or a series of food products produced in the same manufacturing environment‚" says Dr Lucia Anelich‚ a prominent South African food microbiologist and food safety expert.

The City of Tshwane's environmental health practitioners recently traced the source of a hospitalised Tshwane man's listeriosis to chicken supplied to a store by a certain abattoir. Samples they took from the abattoir tested positive for _Listeria monocytogenes_, and the abattoir was closed pending further investigations.

"Although _Listeria monocytogenes_ has been found in a specific abattoir‚ precise confirmation of the strain is still required‚" Anelich says. "Much work needs to be done to match the outbreak strain with food products originating from the same manufacturing environment‚ including clear evidence that the apparently contaminated food was ingested by the majority of people across 9 provinces. As things stand‚ the source of this outbreak is still not known." The significance of isolating _L. monocytogenes_ from raw poultry‚ which is cooked before consumption‚ thus killing the bacterium‚ is questionable‚ Anelich says.

Situation Report on Listeriosis Outbreak South Africa, 2017-2018
-----------------------
Case data and outbreak response activity summary is the best available at time of publication and are updated on an ongoing basis.

Due to recent challenges with NHLS laboratory information system data (since epidemiological week 47) and a possible lag in reporting as a result of the public holidays, case numbers for weeks 47-52 of 2017 are likely to change on a daily basis, and trends must be interpreted with caution until it has been confirmed that all cases have been captured.

Descriptive epidemiology
----------------
As of 3 Jan 2018, a total of 717 laboratory-confirmed listeriosis cases have been reported to NICD since 1 Jan 2017 (Figure 1). Most cases have been reported from Gauteng Province (61%, 436/717) followed by Western Cape (13%, 92/717) and KwaZulu-Natal (7%, 50/717) provinces. Cases have been diagnosed in both public (66%, 470/717) and private (34%, 247/717) healthcare sectors. Diagnosis was based most commonly on the isolation of _Listeria monocytogenes_ in blood culture (70%, 502/717), followed by CSF (24%, 175/717). Where age was reported (n=683), ages range from birth to 93 years (median 26 years) and 39% (268/683) are neonates aged 28 days and under (Figure 2). Of neonatal cases, 96% (258/268) had early-onset disease (birth to 6 days and under). Females account for 55% (382/692) of cases where gender is reported.

As of 2 Jan 2018, case investigation forms (CIFs) of variable completeness have been received for 264/712 (37%) cases. Apart from neonates (28 days and under) and the elderly (over 65 years), additional risk factors for listeriosis reported include pregnancy (15/61 females aged 15-49 years where pregnancy status known) and HIV infection status (44/120 cases with known HIV infection status are HIV-positive). Final outcome data is available for only 19% (134/712) of cases, of which 45% (61/134) died.

Recent developments
--------------------
Environmental Health Practitioners from the City of Tshwane recently investigated a Tshwane patient hospitalised with listeriosis. A chicken sample collected from the fridge at the patient's home tested positive for _L. monocytogenes_. This chicken was traced back to the store, and from there traced back to the abattoir it was sourced from. The Environmental Health Practitioners visited the abattoir and collected food and environmental samples, several of which tested positive for _L. monocytogenes_. As a precaution, the abattoir was closed pending further investigations. The abattoir-related _L. monocytogenes_ are undergoing WGS to assess whether they are related to the ST6 outbreak strain or not; these results will be available during the week.

At present, the source of the outbreak is not known, so it is uncertain which food/s may be implicated. Cases of listeriosis will continue to be investigated, with trace back and further investigation of any positive food/environmental samples.

Update on whole genome sequencing analysis
---------------------------------------
Whole genome sequencing of currently available clinical and food-related (food and food production facility environmental sample) isolates received since 1 Jan 2017 is ongoing. As of 3 Jan 2018, of the 337 isolates sequenced to date, 73% (247/337) are clinical isolates, 22% (74/337) are food isolates, and 5% (16/337) are food production environment isolates.

The clinical isolates are represented by 9 sequence types (ST1, ST101, ST2, ST219, ST5, ST54, ST6, ST8 and ST876); however, 91% (225/247) are sequence type 6 (ST6) and are very closely related, representing a single strain of _L. monocytogenes_ - i.e. the outbreak strain. This ST6 strain has been identified in isolates from all 9 provinces, and this finding supports the current working hypothesis of a single source of food contamination causing the outbreak, i.e. a single widely consumed food product, or multiple food products produced at a single facility.

The food and environmental samples are represented by 18 sequence types, 4 of which (ST1, ST101, ST2 and ST5) are STs also represented in the clinical isolates. However, no ST6 food/environmental isolates have been identified to date.

[When last reported by ProMED-mail (Listeriosis - South Africa (04): fatal, increasing incidence 20171217.5508986), there were a total of 602 laboratory-confirmed listeriosis cases, including 40 deaths. Now there are 720 nationally, including 61 deaths.

A previous ProMED-mail post said that molecular typing, performed on 189 _Listeria monocytogenes_ clinical isolates, found that 71% (134/189) belong to a single sequence type (ST6) and identified a clonal cluster within sequence type (ST) 6. The 1st and 3rd items above say that now ST6 has been identified for over 90% of clinical isolates. This ST6 strain has been identified in isolates from all 9 provinces, which supports the current working hypothesis of a single source of food contamination causing the outbreak, i.e. a single widely consumed food product, or multiple food products produced at a single facility.

The 2nd and 3rd items above say that, although samples taken from a chicken sample in one patient's home and an abattoir from which the chicken had been obtained were positive for _Listeria monocytogenes_, molecular testing of these isolates has not been done as yet to see whether their genotypes match the genotype of the clinical isolate. No ST6 food/environmental isolates have been identified to date, and the source of this outbreak is still not known.

The City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality is the metropolitan municipality that forms the local government of northern Gauteng Province, South Africa; the Metropolitan area is centered on the city of Pretoria with surrounding towns and localities included into the local government area (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Tshwane_Metropolitan_Municipality). Gauteng Province, with a population of about 14 million residents in 2017, contains the country's largest city, Johannesburg, as well as Pretoria (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauteng).
