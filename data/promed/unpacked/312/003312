Last September 2013, an outbreak of enterohemorrhagic _Escherichia coli_ (EHEC) was linked to watercress, although the underlying cause was uncertain. By looking at a 2nd outbreak, researchers have found that EHEC was transferred from a neighboring cattle field near to the watercress farm, either through wildlife entering the watercress or run-off water. Between 30 Aug 2013 and 19 Sep 2013, 19 cases across England, Wales, and Scotland were reported. Despite trace-back investigations, microbiological testing of watercress, and environmental sampling at farms, the source of contamination of the watercress remains unclear.

Another 2 cases were retrospectively identified in February 2013. One had consumed watercress and one pre-packaged salad, both from retailers representing a different supply chain, suggesting that the contamination is unlikely to have occurred at the farms.

Following restocking of watercress at the supermarket chain, an additional case was reported with an onset date of 21 Oct 2013. The case reported consuming bagged mixed salad containing watercress from that supermarket. No further cases of the outbreak profile have been reported.

The watercress supplier is working with the Food Standards Agency to review their policies and procedures in light of the outbreaks, while the Gastrointestinal, Emerging and Zoonotic Infections department are remaining vigilant for any new cases of the 2 outbreak strains or clusters of EHEC cases reporting watercress consumption.

[Whether grown in water or on land, produce eaten without cooking transmit enteric pathogens, which contaminate them during growing or after harvest.

Watercress (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watercress), _Nasturtium officinale_, is a fast-growing, aquatic or semi-aquatic, perennial plant native to Europe and Asia, and one of the oldest known leaf vegetables consumed by humans. It is a member of the family _Brassicaceae_, botanically related to garden cress, mustard and radish -- all noteworthy for a peppery, tangy flavor.

The common liver fluke, _Fasciola hepatica_, can also be transmitted to man when metacercariae [the encysted resting or maturing stage of a trematode parasite in the tissues of an intermediate host or on vegetation] encysted on aquatic vegetation such as watercress is eaten, or when water containing metacercariae is drunk. Human infections occur in parts of Europe, northern Africa, Cuba, South America, and other locales. - Mod.LL
