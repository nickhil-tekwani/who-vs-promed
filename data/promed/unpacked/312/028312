A a man in his 30s originally from Ravno, Bosnia and Herzegovina traveled with his wife and children to his home town for a family event. The man had no significant past medical history. While there, the family visited a local zoo, hiked, and visited ta cheese factory (which employs 4 people) outside Ravno. The factory uses cow and goat milk for producing cheese, and all cheese preparation is manual.

Two days after this visit, the patient started having a low grade [fever]. Five days later, upon returning to the USA to Connecticut, he presented to an emergency room with a fever of 101 F [38.3 C], significant headache, and some watery diarrhea. Because of sensitivity to light and some neck rigidity, a spinal tap was performed. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture grew _Listeria monocytogenes_. The following day, his wife was admitted with a similar clinical picture but with a less severe headache, and her CSF culture also grew _L. monocytogenes_.

The factory also reported 3 more cases of a similar disease locally over 2 weeks. Both milk sources, goat and cow, were cultured, and the goat culture was positive for _L. monocytogenes_.

Cheese production was temporarily halted for "terminal cleaning."

[The following is excerpted from ProMED report: Listeriosis - USA: (NC, MA), alert, archive Number: 20071230.4186 by my colleague Mod.ML:

"_Listeria monocytogenes_, the cause of listeriosis, is widely distributed in nature. The organism can be found in soil, water, silage, raw vegetables, raw meat and poultry, raw and pasteurized milk, soft cheeses, kitchen premises, and in the intestinal tract of many animals, including cattle, sheep, and humans, and in crustaceans, fish, shellfish, ticks, and insects. Most human infections are foodborne, although vertical transmission can occur from mother to fetus transplacentally or during delivery through an infected birth canal, and localized skin infections can occur in veterinarians and farmers by direct contact with infected animals. Contamination of food can occur in nature, e.g., raw vegetables contaminated by soil and manure, and raw milk by infected cows, or following subsequent cooking or other processing.

Because the organisms can multiply at refrigerator temperatures, it is not surprising that listeriosis is usually associated with ingestion of contaminated milk, meat or vegetable products that have been held at refrigeration temperatures. Listeria can also survive in frozen food. Consumption of raw milk, raw-milk soft cheeses (e.g., brie, camembert, and Mexican soft cheeses), coleslaw, pate, deli meats, and hotdogs have been sources of human listeriosis. The sources of human infection can be pinpointed by DNA identification techniques matching _Listeria_ spp. isolated from a possible source with a species recovered from a patient.

Listeriosis is a world-wide zoonosis caused by _Listeria moncytogenes_, which is transmitted from the intestinal tract of farm animals to humans by ingestion of contaminated food. Infection results in diarrhea and in some patients invasive disease that includes bacteremia without an evident focus, meningitis, abscesses in the brain and spinal cord, endocarditis, and intrauterine infection. Infection during pregnancy can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn, or stillbirth. Invasive listeriosis is rare (about 2500 cases occur annually in the US), but the disease has an overall mortality rate of 20 to 30 percent. Newborns, pregnant women, people 60 years of age or older, and those with compromised immune defenses (e.g., HIV-infected patients) are most susceptible to invasive disease.

The organism can be killed by pasteurization, but heavy contamination can reduce pasteurization's effectiveness. Although cooking can kill the organism, contaminated surfaces in food preparation areas can contaminate previously cooked food that requires no further cooking prior to eating. The organism can then continue to grow in the refrigerated, packaged ready-to-eat product, since _L. monocytogenes_ grows at refrigerator temperatures. Its presence in food does not alter the taste or smell of the food."

It is not clear whether the implicated goat cheese was made from pasteurized milk or not. The most important take-away point here is that _Listeria_ meningitis can occur in seemingly immunocompetent individuals. This is important because some antimicrobials used for treatment of presumptive bacterial meningitis (such as ceftriaxone, because of lack of activity, and vancomycin, because of poor CSF penetration) are not ideal for _Listeria_ meningitis. - Mod.LL
