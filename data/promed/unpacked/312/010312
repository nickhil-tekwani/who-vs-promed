[Ref: WS Sserubombwe et al: Diversity of begomoviruses associated
with mosaic disease of cultivated cassava (_Manihot esculenta_
Crantz) and its wild relative (_Manihot glaziovii_ Muell. Arg.) in
Uganda. J Gen Virol 2008; 89(7): 1759-1769; DOI:10.1099/vir.0.83637-0]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
To date, 7 begomovirus species have been identified in association
with CMD [cassava mosaic disease], namely _African cassava mosaic
virus_, _East African cassava mosaic virus_, _East African cassava
mosaic Cameroon virus_, _East African cassava mosaic Malawi virus_,
_East African cassava mosaic Zanzibar virus_, East African cassava
mosaic Kenya virus, and _South African cassava mosaic virus_.

Cassava (_Manihot esculenta_) growing in Uganda during 2001-2002 has
been screened for the presence of begomoviruses using several
molecular methods. In contrast with a recent survey in neighbouring
Kenya, which identified 3 distinct strains of East African cassava
mosaic virus (EACMV, EACMV-UG, and EACMV-KE2) as well as _East
African cassava mosaic Zanzibar virus_ and the new species East
African cassava mosaic Kenya virus, only EACMV-UG and, to a lesser
extent, _African cassava mosaic virus_ (ACMV) were found associated
with cassava in Uganda.

Both EACMV-UG and ACMV were also associated with _Manihot glaziovii_.
Infectivity studies using cloned components confirmed that viruses
from one host could infect the other, suggesting that this wild
relative of cassava might be a reservoir host for the disease.

The relatively low level of diversity of begomoviruses associated
with cassava mosaic disease in Uganda is consistent with reports that
EACMV-UG has displaced other begomovirus species and strains during
the recent epidemic that swept through the country.

[Cassava is a major factor in food security across sub-Saharan
Africa. In the past, production has been severely affected by cassava
mosaic disease (CMD) caused by several viruses in the genus
_Begomovirus_ (family _Geminiviridae_). CMD symptoms include leaf
mosaic, distortion, and stunting of plants. A number of different
species and strains have been identified in different areas of Africa
associated with CMD. Co-infections as well as genetic recombination
between strains have also been reported. Such an event has led to the
emergence of a particularly virulent recombinant strain in Uganda in
the late 1980s, which subsequently wiped out crops in east and
central Africa resulting in widespread food shortages and localised
famine. According to the report above, the new strain has by now
become predominant in Uganda.

Traditional cassava varieties succumb to CMD. While disease
management of begomoviruses usually relies on control of their
whitefly vectors and pathogen and/or vector reservoir plants, vector
control has proven unsatisfactory under conditions in developing
countries. Thus, the use of resistant crop cultivars appears to be
the best way to control CMD.

To co-ordinate management efforts in the region and to assess the
risk of recombination events leading to a more virulent pathogen, it
is important to identify and monitor viral strains and species in
particular areas. Specific resistance requirements can then be
incorporated in programmes to develop CMD- resistant cultivars for local use.
