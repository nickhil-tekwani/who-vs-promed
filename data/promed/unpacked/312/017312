Guangzhou doctors say unknown virus caused pneumonia, not chlamydia
--------------------------------------------------
Doctors in Guangzhou who examined specimens from persons who died from
atypical pneumonia in the city said the disease was caused by a yet unknown
virus and not by "chlamydia," as was concluded by official institutions in
Beijing.
A doctor with Guangzhou-based First Medical Military University Nanfang
Hospital who participated in the examinations told XFN that it is still too
early to exclude the possibility that the virus is a variation of the
bird-flu virus.
"We believe the disease was caused by a virus, but further analysis and
tests are needed to identify the actual virus," the doctor, who declined to
be identified, told XFN.
A 9-year-old Hong Kong boy has been infected with the H5N1 bird flu virus
in Fujian province, which borders Guangdong province, and his father and
sister have died from pneumonia, foreign media reported.
Officials in Guangdong and Fujian have rejected claims of any bird-flu
cases, the foreign media added.
Xinhua news agency reported earlier in the week that the illness in
Guangdong province that killed 5 and affected 305 people was caused by
chlamydia, citing a research report jointly prepared by the Chinese Center
for Disease Control and Prevention and Guangdong Provincial Disease Control
and Prevention Center.
The news agency said chlamydia was found in the lungs of 2 patients who
died from atypical pneumonia.
Xinhua said chlamydia could be spread through exposure to patients or
infected birds through secretions from the respiratory tract, but it added
chlamydia is "completely preventable".
Guangdong residents earlier this month responded to reports of an unknown
disease with increased buying of Chinese herbal drinks, vinegar, rice, and
salt.

[As a reminder, this moderator added a provocative comment with a
speculation that there might be a connection between the H5N1 human case(s)
reported from Hong Kong with history of travel to Fujian (see ProMED-mail
posting Influenza, H5N1 human case - China (Hong
Kong) 20030219.0428). Hence, this newswire seems to add more fuel to the
speculative fire. Readers should be cautioned before interpreting this as
proof, as both this moderator's comment and the above newswire's comments
are based on speculation of an observation that there was an unusual,
apparently limited outbreak of pneumonia in a province of mainland China
that is geographically located between Hong Kong and Fujian Province, where
there have now been 2 documented cases of human infection with H5N1
influenza virus. Clearly, we await further information from official
sources with results of official testing addressing the question of whether
H5N1 influenza virus was responsible for additional human cases. - Mod.MPP]
