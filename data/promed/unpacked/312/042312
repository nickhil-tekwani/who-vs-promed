A KLM flight Amsterdam to Sana'a, Yemen, had a Jedda, Saudi Arabia, passenger stop for general
cleanup. "Something" was exhausted from the ceiling vent and it wasn't Chanel No. 5. As a former
fruitgrower, it smelled [to me very familiar, although others seemed not to notice.

Could anyone give me any information on the 2% permethrin that AQIS [Australian Quarantine and
Inspection Service requires for aircraft disinsecting? I've also experienced spraying in the cabin
just prior to arrival in American Samoa. Any ideas as to what was being sprayed there?

Re: West Nile-like virus, aircraft spraying (02) above:
The comment about spraying not affecting mosquitos in clothing [when carried between research
labs in containers inside pockets seems to open to question the effectiveness of any spraying,
regardless of who developed the protocol.
What evidence can be cited in terms of percentage of mosquitos killed? How likely is it that
mosquitos and other vermin are not in spaces equivalent to "exposed screened containers"? The
usage of sprays in confined spaces should be curtailed drastically based on the lack of human
inhalation toxicology data, and in fact should be terminated unless the appropriate inhalation
toxicology data are known in detail and show no human risk to any given spray.

There have been quite a number of field trials on all different manners of aircraft disinsection.
Yes -- if done as it should be, it will work.
The number of cases of "airport malaria," plus cases of airport thing we do not know about,
demonstrate that aircraft disinsection is often very necessary indeed. Overall, the insistence of the
French Government that all aircraft coming in from malaria endemic areas of Africa [be sprayed
has largely stopped airport malaria.
I can provide references on imported vector-borne diseases if wanted from my database.
I can understand the concern with possible toxicological hazards from malathion, but only
pyrethroids are applied aboard aircraft as space sprays and residual sprays in the cabin; their [use
aboard aircraft has been considered.by the International Program for Chemical Safety and found
safe to use. I know that other materials are used for pest control aboard aircraft against
cockroaches and other pest insects, but mosquito control is based on pyrethroids as described in
the comments from Australia.
