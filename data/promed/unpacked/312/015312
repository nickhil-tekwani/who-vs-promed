The United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service confirmed 4 additional cases of virulent Newcastle disease in backyard birds in San Bernardino County, California.

A complete list of confirmed cases is available on our website at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animalhealth/vnd.

Virulent Newcastle disease has not been found in commercial poultry in the United States since 2003.

No human cases of Newcastle disease have ever occurred from eating poultry products. Properly cooked poultry products are safe to eat. In very rare instances, people working directly with sick birds can become infected. Symptoms are usually very mild and limited to conjunctivitis. Infection is easily prevented by using standard personal protective equipment.

Samples from the flocks were tested at the California Animal Health & Food Safety Laboratory System (CAHFS). The APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa confirms all findings. APHIS is working closely with the California Department of Food and Agriculture to respond to these findings and to conduct an epidemiological investigation. Federal and State partners are also conducting additional surveillance and testing in the area.

In addition to practicing good biosecurity, all bird owners should report sick birds or unusual bird deaths to State/Federal officials, either through their state veterinarian or USDA's toll-free number at 1-866-536-7593. Additional information on biosecurity for backyard flocks can be found at Biosecurity for Birds.

[The background link http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animalhealth/vnd is very informative. The 1st in this series was reported on 17 May 2018 in Los Angeles County in "Backyard exhibition chickens;" then on 24 May 2018 in San Bernadino county in "Backyard mixed species birds," and now on 28 May 2018 again in San Bernadino county in just backyard chickens.

While Newcastle virus is very contagious and can travel distances in aerosols [Hugh-Jones, M.E.; Allan, W.H.; Dark, F.A.; Harper, G.J. 1973. The Evidence for the Airborne Spread of Newcastle Disease. J. Hyg., Camb. 71: 325-39. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2130488/pdf/jhyg00080-0111.pdf], the commonest form of spread is contaminated containers and transports and of virus shedding birds.

The 1st 2 outbreaks were not in your usual egg-laying domestic birds. Way back in the early '70s when Bill Allan and I were researching this disease, we found that infected vaccinated birds were healthy but significant virus shedders. Remember this.
