Hog dumping is occurring in southern markets due to disease. "High
Fever Disease" is showing signs of resurgence in southern areas and
has reached very high levels in some places, including Zhangzhou, in
the Fujian province. As a result, there is a certain level of dumping
in some affected areas.

[The above excerpt is indicative of the fact that the syndrome,
initially named "high fever disease" and later recognized as PRRS and
which has been causing significant losses in China since mid 2006, is
still circulating, particularly during the warmer months.

Fujian province, to which the above information refers, is in
southeast China and can be seen on the map at

The following abstract of an FAO review may serve as a reminder of
some key facts regarding the disease. - Mod.AS]

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), 1st recognized
in the United States in 1987, although its description had appeared
in some countries years earlier, is now found in almost all swine
producing countries.

A number of PRRS outbreaks have occurred recently in South Africa,
Russia, China and Viet Nam. The disease, which represents a worldwide
threat, is characterized by reproductive failure of sows and
respiratory distress of piglets and fattening pigs, which, combined
with a potential for rapid spread, can cause significant production
and economic losses.

Two major antigenic types of the virus exist, the European and the
American type. Some of the reports from Asia, where the PRRS virus
has been isolated, describe a disease of swine with high mortality in
different age groups.

The key elements for prevention, control and eradication of PRRS are
early detection and rapid laboratory confirmation, quick
identification of infected farms, and rapid response through a
variety of stamping out strategies and the use of vaccines with
proven efficacy.

This "Focus on PRRS" recommends that veterinary services reinforce
their capacity in PRRS surveillance and diagnosis by training
veterinarians in disease recognition and by initiating or reviewing
contingency plans in the event of disease introduction. It is also
important to update risk assessments for PRRS and other transboundary
swine diseases, giving adequate attention to the trade in live pigs
for breeding, pork products and routes of infection, such as semen or
swill feeding with contaminated products from affected areas.
