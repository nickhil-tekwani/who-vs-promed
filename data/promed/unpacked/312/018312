[The 17th meeting of the GF-TAD's [Global Framework for the Progressive Control of Transboundary Animal Diseases] Standing Group of Experts on ASF in Europe (SGE ASF17) took place as a teleconference on 4 Jun 2021. In the updated presentations from the member countries of the SGE ASF, Russian Federation mentioned that: "Regionalization is currently applied inside the Russian Federation, with different administrative divisions considered. Since the beginning of 2021, there were 24 outbreaks detected in wild boar carcasses, especially in the Far East (conservation area for Amur Tigers). The other regions with outbreaks were essentially in the central-south regions of the Russian Federation. There, surveillance gave 100 [percent] PCR positivity in wild boar found dead, as well as in hunted wild boar. The largest outbreak to date was detected in domestic animals in the same period, with 462 000 pigs culled in a commercial farm in Tverskaya oblast. The source of the virus in backyard outbreaks is essentially due to swill feeding. This year (2021), there were no issues with COVID-19; restrictions were limited, but some owners did not want to let inspectors in for the inventory because they were afraid of getting infected by the virus."
