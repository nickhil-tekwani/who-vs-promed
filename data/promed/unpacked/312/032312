One year ago, the Department of Justice closed its case against Fort
Detrick researcher Bruce Ivins, releasing a 92-page investigative
summary declaring he was the sole culprit in the 2001 anthrax attacks
that killed 5 and sickened 17. The report touted "both direct evidence
that anthrax spores under his sole and exclusive control were the
parent material to the anthrax spores used in the attack and
compelling circumstantial evidence."

Last week, a National Research Council committee released a 170-page
report casting doubt on the science the FBI used in its investigation,
leaving the Justice Department with circumstantial evidence that many
say wouldn't hold up in court.

"I think my feelings of mistrust of the FBI's conclusions in this
case have only been strengthened over the last year," Jeffrey
Adamovicz, a former chief of bacteriology who supervised Ivins' work
at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases,
wrote in an e-mail. "First, the (NRC) report itself was delayed for
release, and now that the report is out, I feel somewhat vindicated in
my assessment that the FBI was overselling the science and its ability
to prove that Bruce Ivins and only Bruce Ivins could have committed
this crime."

The Justice Department report last year [2010] said its repository of
anthrax samples "represents a sample from every Ames culture at every
laboratory identified by the FBI as having Ames strain," and that the
FBI provided a "clear and thorough protocol for the preparation of the
repository submissions."

The NRC dismissed those notions, saying the repository was not ideal
or complete. The instructions "were not precise enough to ensure that
the laboratories would follow a consistent procedure." Such problems
with the repository required additional investigation and limit the
strength of the conclusions that can be drawn from comparisons of
these samples and the letter material."

More importantly, though, Justice wrote last year [2010] that "the
only complete genetic match to the evidence comes from RMR-1029 and
its offspring," and the FBI, as a result, focused much of its
attention on Ivins and other researchers with whom he had shared
anthrax samples. Last week's NRC report, however, said that Justice
misrepresented its findings.

"The scientific data generated by and on behalf of the FBI provided
leads as to a possible source of the anthrax spores found in the
attack letters, but these data alone did not rule out other sources,"
the report says. The NRC committee wrote that the mutations found in
both the RMR-1029 samples and the attack anthrax could have arisen by
parallel evolution instead of one being derived from the other, and
the fact that the FBI did not explore this possible explanation
weakens the Justice Department's interpretation of the genetic
similarities between Ivins' anthrax and the attack anthrax, the report
says.

"This is huge, because coupled with the lack of any other physical
(forensic) evidence in this case linked to Bruce, this shows that the
FBI's central tenet -- that the anthrax could have come from only
Bruce Ivins -- is without factual merit and is, therefore, just a
possibility," Adamovicz wrote in an e-mail. "They over-represented
this possibility as if there were no other explanations."

Gerry Andrews, another former chief of bacteriology at USAMRIID, said
that after reading the NRC report: "I'm even more convinced now that
Dr. Ivins had nothing to do with this crime." Andrews wrote in an
e-mail that he believed the case needed to be reopened or that
Congress should investigate further. Andrews pointed out several items
in the NRC report that he disagreed with and would like to see
investigated further.

First, he said the presence of a unique strain of a 2nd bacteria, _B.
subtilis_, should have been considered key forensic evidence instead
of the FBI and NRC committee glossing over it. "If a cloth fiber was
found in one (or more) of the anthrax envelopes, you can be darn sure
that the FBI would consider this finding as 'key forensic evidence,'"
Andrews wrote. "The presence of any usual/unexpected substance or
material, in this case, _B. subtilis_, is VERY relevant to the case;
it just doesn't support the FBI's conclusion that Dr. Ivins was the
perpetrator. I believe that the FBI didn't investigate this finding
thoroughly enough or was deceived."

He also said the FBI and NRC committee were too quick to gloss over
the issue of the silicon content of some of the anthrax spores in the
attack letters. Bacteriologists working on the investigation should
have looked into several possibilities for how the silicon got onto
and into the spores instead of dismissing it as an irrelevant forensic
marker. "I don't believe the high silicon signature was an accident,
nor do I think that the (committee's) conclusion on the silica is
strong," he wrote.

The Government Accountability Office is still looking into the
federal government's response to the anthrax attacks, and some
lawmakers are still pushing for a congressional investigation, much
like the one into the September 11th terrorist attacks [see below -

After the deadly shooting rampage in Tucson, Sen. Patrick J. Leahy
(D-Vt.) was asked to reflect on his own experience as the would-be
target of an assassin. That's when he let slip something that he
rarely talks about publicly: He has never accepted the FBI's decision
to close the case in the series of anthrax-laced letters mailed to
public officials in fall 2001. "I still wonder who sent it and why
they sent it," the Judiciary Committee chairman told a crowd gathered
last month [January 2011] at the Newseum in Northwest Washington to
hear his 2011 legislative agenda.

On Tuesday [15 Feb 2011], the National Research Council questioned
the efficacy of the genetic testing used by the FBI to allege that a
Fort Detrick scientist had acted alone in mailing the deadly letters
to Capitol Hill and media outlets. Leahy has generally declined to
comment on the anthrax investigation, telling The Washington Post that
he has tried not to discuss it much "because it affects me so..." his
voice trailing off without finishing the thought. But in a brief
interview Tuesday [15 Feb 2011], he said he has "extreme doubts" about
the case. "I've expressed those concerns to the FBI, and this report
adds to those concerns," Leahy said.

The handling of the almost 9-year investigation, dubbed "Amerithrax"
by the FBI, has never sat well with Congress. On Tuesday [15 Feb
2011], Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), a longtime FBI critic,
called for an independent review, and Rep. Rush D. Holt (D-N.J.), from
whose district the letters to Leahy and others were mailed, called for
Congress to create an independent commission to examine the entire
case. For years, the targets of the Capitol Hill-bound letters felt
shut out of the anthrax investigation, which included an official
blackout of any congressional briefings ordered by the Bush
administration in 2004. Now, however, there are key figures throughout
the Obama administration, and Leahy and Grassley are the top senators
on the Judiciary panel with FBI oversight.

A huge collection of former Daschle staff members now occupy the
highest echelon of posts in the Obama administration. Pete Rouse, then
the chief of staff to the majority leader, is President Obama's deputy
chief of staff. Laura Petrou, the top aide in Daschle's suites in the
Hart Senate Office Building, where an anthrax letter was opened 16 Oct
2001, is now chief of staff at the Department of Health and Human
Services. Mark Patterson, then Daschle's top policy adviser, is chief
of staff at the Treasury Department.

To Leahy and others on Capitol Hill, a key issue is whether other
scientists helped Ivins or handled the anthrax itself. The council's
report, commissioned by the FBI, "did not definitively" demonstrate a
link between the anthrax used in the deadly letters and that in a
flask in Ivins's lab at the Army base in Maryland. It also questioned
whether Ivins, as the FBI has alleged, was the only scientist at the
base with the expertise to handle those anthrax spores. That left a
sense of bewilderment among current and former officials on Capitol
Hill.

"It is mystifying. Given the limited number of people who have
experience with anthrax, you just wouldn't think it would be this
hard," said another official who had been briefed on the Amerithrax
investigation. The official requested anonymity to discuss a sensitive
probe.

Last month [January 2011], Leahy said there was no question that
others were involved in the anthrax attack, at least in helping Ivins
hide his work from authorities. "Were there people who at the very
least were accessories after the fact? I think there were," he said.
Leahy also finds it strange that one person would target such an odd
collection of media and political figures in the anthrax letters, a
motive that has never been fully explained by the FBI or Justice
Department.

"Why would he send one to Tom Brokaw, to Tom Daschle, to me, to the
man at the National Enquirer in Florida?" Leahy asked. "They have to
make their decisions; I have to make mine. In my mind, it's not
closed," he said. "Call it an old prosecutor's instinct."

"NAS Report Makes Clear There Are Still Questions to be Answered and
Still Lessons to be Learned"

Rep. Rush Holt (NJ-12) today [15 Feb 2011] is reintroducing the
Anthrax Attacks Investigation Act, legislation that would establish a
Congressional commission to investigate the 2001 anthrax attacks and
the federal government's response to and investigation of the attacks.
Holt is introducing the bill on the same day that the National Academy
of Sciences issued its report raising questions about the Federal
Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) scientific conclusions in the
"Amerithrax" case. He 1st introduced the legislation in September
2008.

"The NAS report makes clear there are still questions to be answered
and still lessons to be learned about the FBI's investigation into the
attacks," Holt said. "It would take a credulous person to believe the
circumstantial evidence that the FBI used to draw its conclusions with
such certainty. The FBI has not proven to me that this is an open and
shut case. We still badly need a 9/11-style commission to determine
how the attacks happened and whether we learned the lessons to prepare
for another attack."

The 11-member bipartisan commission would investigate the attacks,
assess the federal government's response to and investigation of the
attacks, and make recommendations to the President and Congress on how
the country can best prevent or respond to a future bioterror attack.
Just as the 9/11 Commission looked not only at the attacks of that
morning but also at recommended changes in the structure of government
agencies, screening methods, and Congressional oversight, an anthrax
commission would look not only at the attacks, but also measures for
prevention, detection, and investigation of any future bio-terrorism.

The commission would consider scientific, technical evidence as well
as classified evidence the NAS did not examine.

The 2001 attacks evidently originated from a postal box in Holt's
Central New Jersey congressional district, disrupting the lives and
livelihoods of many of his constituents. Holt has consistently raised
questions about the federal investigation into the attacks.

"Too many questions remain about the anthrax attacks and the
government's bungled response to the attacks," Holt said. "A high
level commission, like the 9/11 Commission, would be a start-to-finish
examination of the many outstanding questions, and it would help
American families know that the government is prepared to protect them
and their children from future bioterrorism attacks."

[US Senator Grassley has issued a similar statement; see:
<http://www.iowapolitics.com/index.iml?Article=226986>.

It isn't over 'til it's over. The informed points made by Jeffrey
Adamovicz and Gerry Andrews are of singular scientific and
investigative importance. They are not alone in asking such questions.
Members are encouraged to read the original articles in full. -
