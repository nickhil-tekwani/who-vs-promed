A Quarter Horse in Keremeos County, British Columbia was confirmed with pigeon fever, and other horses on the property were suspected of having the disease.

According to a report from the Equine Disease Communication Center, an attending veterinarian at a Keremeos County, British Columbia farm confirmed that one horse tested positive for pigeon fever. Three other horses are suspected of having pigeon fever on that property.

The Quarter Horse testing positive had onset of clinical signs on 30 Nov 2020 and was confirmed on 30 Nov 2020. The horse is recovering.

[Pigeon fever [PF] is a _Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis_ infection.

"_C. pseudotuberculosis_ is a Gram-positive bacterium with worldwide distribution. _C. pseudotuberculosis_ is considered an emerging disease in North America; cases have been reported throughout the United States. Outbreaks in areas in which the bacteria had previously not been or had only rarely been reported have occurred during times of drought. Infection has been reported in equids, sheep, goats, cattle, buffalo, camelids, and on rare occasions, humans. Biotypes isolated from small ruminants and camelids are nitrate negative, while those from horses are nitrate positive. Natural cross-species transmission does not occur between sheep and horses; however, cattle can have infection from either biotype.

Clinical signs
----------
Three forms of PF have been described in horses: external abscesses, internal infection, and ulcerative lymphangitis or limb infection. Ulcerative lymphangitis and internal infection must be treated more aggressively with antimicrobial therapy, while use of antimicrobials for external abscesses is generally unnecessary. _C. pseudotuberculosis_ produces various extracellular exotoxins which play a role in virulence and explain the presence of pain and edema at the site of infection.

External abscesses
- Are the most common manifestation, with single or multiple abscesses.
- May occur anywhere on the body, but most frequently in the pectoral region (swelling resembles a pigeon's breast) and along the ventral midline [hence the name, pigeon fever. - Mod.TG].
- Additional sites for abscess formation are the prepuce, mammary gland, triceps, axilla, limbs, and head.
- Septic joints and osteomyelitis have been reported
- Abscesses contain tan, odor-free purulent exudate and are usually well encapsulated. Horses with external abscesses do not usually develop signs of systemic illness, however, one-quarter will develop fever. If signs of systemic illness are present, further diagnostics to rule out internal infection are warranted, and antimicrobial therapy should be considered. While there is considerable variation in severity among horses, most straight-forward cases can be treated with lancing and draining the abscesses when mature.
- The case fatality for horses with external abscesses is very low (0.8%)

Internal infection occurs in approximately 8% of affected horses and is associated with a high case fatality rate (30 to 40%). Diagnosis can be challenging, and long-term antimicrobial therapy is imperative for a successful outcome. In a retrospective study, the organs most commonly involved were liver, kidney, spleen, and lungs. Abortion due to placentitis or fetal infection has been reported. Horses with internal infection are more frequently seen one to 2 months following the peak number of cases with external abscesses.

Ulcerative lymphangitis is the least common form seen in North America, although this form of disease has been reported worldwide. Ulcerative lymphangitis manifests as a severe limb swelling and cellulitis, with multiple draining tracts following lymphatics. Most commonly, one or both hind limbs are affected. Horses often develop a severe lameness, fever, lethargy, and anorexia. Aggressive medical therapy (antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory) is necessary, or the disease often becomes chronic, resulting in limb edema, prolonged or recurrent infection, lameness, weakness, and weight loss.

Incubation period
---------------
Approximately 3-4 weeks.

Risk factors
-------------
The incidence of disease fluctuates considerably from year to year presumably due to herd immunity and environmental factors such as rainfall and temperature. Disease incidence is seasonal, with the highest number of cases occurring during the dry months of the year, which is summer and fall in the Southwestern US, although cases may be seen all year.

Transmission
-------------
The portal of entry is soil contamination of abrasions or wounds in the skin or mucous membranes. Many insects have been incriminated as vectors for the transmission of the disease to horses; studies have shown that _Haematobia irritans_ (horn fly, sometimes referred to as the small horned fly), _Musca domestica_, (house fly), and _Stomoxys calcitrans_ (stable fly) can act as mechanical vectors of this disease. The regional location of abscesses suggests ventral midline dermatitis is a predisposing cause of infection. Within a geographic area, the disease appeared to be transmitted between 7 and 56 days throughout a 4.3 to 6.5 km distance, strongly suggesting the disease could be transmitted through horse-to-horse contact or from infected to susceptible horses via insects, other vectors, or contaminated soil.

Diagnostic sampling, testing, and handling
---------------------------
The most common clinical signs are concurrent external abscesses, decreased appetite, fever, lethargy, weight loss, and signs of respiratory disease or abdominal pain. A diagnosis of internal infection is, based on clinical signs, clinicopathologic data, serology, diagnostic imaging, and bacterial culture. Other signs observed in horses with internal abscesses include ventral edema, ventral dermatitis, ataxia, hematuria (due to renal abscesses), and uncommonly, abortion. Bacterial culture of aspirates or exudate is used to confirm diagnosis.

Clinical pathologic abnormalities that may be observed include:
- anemia of chronic disease
- leukocytosis with neutrophilia
- hyperfibrinogenemia
- hyperproteinemia.

These hematological parameters can occur with either internal or external abscesses but are more consistently observed with internal abscesses.

Serologic testing using the synergistic hemolysis inhibition (SHI) test can be useful in aiding the diagnosis of internal abscesses and is available through the California Animal Health and Food Safety Laboratory System, the Washington Animal Disease Diagnostic Lab, the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory, and the Colorado State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratories. The SHI test is used to detect IgG antibody to _C. pseudotuberculosis_ in horses with active infections and is useful in identifying internal infections in horses without external abscesses. Serology is generally not helpful for diagnosis of external abscesses and may be negative early in the course of disease and even the time of abscess drainage. Positive SHI titers must be interpreted carefully and combined with clinical signs to distinguish active infection from exposure or convalescence.

University of California data:
- reciprocal titer of 256 or higher is indicative of active infection
- internal abscesses generally have SHI titers 512 or higher
- titers 16 or lower are considered negative
- titers between 16 and 128 are considered suspicious or indicative of exposure. There is considerable overlap in results from horses with active disease, exposure, and recovery from infection.

The SHI test is most accurate for diagnosis of internal infection in the absence of external abscesses. The SHI test should not be used alone to diagnose internal infection without other supportive diagnostics.

Abdominal ultrasonography is the most useful tool for identifying affected internal organs and for revealing the nature and extent of involvement. Abdominal ultrasonography also facilitates transcutaneous liver and kidney biopsy procedures and aspiration of abscess fluid for definitive diagnosis. Ultrasonography should be used in conjunction with hematologic and serum biochemical analyses to monitor response to treatment and may be the only available modality to monitor horses in which there is no clinicopathologic evidence of organ disease.

Environmental persistence
--------------------------
The organism has been shown to survive for up to 2 months in hay and shavings, and more than 8 months in soil samples at environmental temperatures. In experimental studies, the presence of manure favored survival and replication of bacteria in soil.

Specific control measures
--------------------------
Biosecurity measures
Implementation of biosecurity practices to limit the spread of _C. pseudotuberculosis_ are aimed at reducing environmental contamination and spread via insects or fomites. The bacterium is endemic in many regions of the world and survives for months in soil, particularly when contaminated with manure.

Suggested biosecurity measures
- Wear disposable examination gloves followed by hand washing
- Isolate affected horses from naive herd mates
- Protect horses from insect exposure by regular application of insect repellant, particularly to the ventral midline (prevention of ventral midline dermatitis)
- Practice meticulous wound care (topical fly repellants, antimicrobial ointments, and bandages) to prevent infection from a contaminated environment.

Vaccination
There is currently no licensed, commercially available vaccine in the United States for control of _C. pseudotuberculosis_ in horses. Use of autogenous bacterin-toxoids designed for horses has demonstrated increased SHI titers following 2 injections, however, the protection remains to be established.

Treatment
The treatment regimen for external abscesses must be individualized for each horse depending on the severity of disease, the presence of systemic illness such as fever or anorexia, the extent of soft tissue inflammation, the maturity of the abscess, and the ability to successfully establish drainage of purulent exudate.

Establishing drainage is the most important treatment and ultimately leads to faster resolution and return to athletic performance. The proximity of the fibrous abscess capsule to the skin varies, often being less than 1 cm deep for ventral midline abscesses, to greater than 10 cm deep underlying muscle for some pectoral, axillary, triceps, or inguinal abscesses. The use of diagnostic ultrasound is helpful for localization of deeper abscesses and to judge maturity of the abscess and proximity to the skin.

The abscess contents and lavage solutions such as saline with or without antiseptic should be retrieved and disposed of to prevent further contamination of the immediate environment.

Antimicrobial therapy
Antimicrobials are indicated for horses with ulcerative lymphangitis and for horses with internal abscesses. Horses with deep intramuscular abscesses that are lanced and draining through healthy tissue may also benefit from antimicrobial therapy.
- The use of antimicrobials for external abscesses is not necessary in many horses and may prolong the time to resolution
- Antimicrobial therapy may be justified when signs of systemic illness are present, such as fever, depression, and anorexia, or when extensive cellulitis or lameness is present

Considerations: the intracellular location of the organism, the presence of exudates and a thick abscess capsule, and the duration of therapy are important, as are the cost of the drug and the convenience of administration.

_C. pseudotuberculosisis_ susceptible in vitro to many antimicrobials commonly used in horses, including penicillin G, macrolides, tetracyclines, cephalosporins, chloramphenicol, fluoroquinolones, and rifampin.

Despite in vitro susceptibility, the nature of the bacteria and the copious exudate render certain antimicrobials ineffective for some cases.

External abscesses especially on the ventral midline:
- trimethoprim-sulfa (30mg/kg twice daily orally) or procaine penicillin (20 000 U/kg twice daily intramuscularly) are effective for internal abscesses
- rifampin (2.5-5 mg/kg twice daily orally) in combination with ceftiofur (2.5-5 mg/kg twice daily intravenously or intramuscularly) appears highly effective for treatment of internal abscesses. Also, enrofloxacin (7.5 mg/kg once daily orally).

The average duration of antimicrobial therapy for internal infection is 4-6 weeks and is best determined by serial ultrasound and clinicopathologic results.

Ulcerative lymphangitis or cellulitis
- Horses should be treated early and aggressively with antimicrobials to minimize the possibility of residual lameness or limb swelling
- Intravenous antimicrobials (ceftiofur or penicillin G) alone or in combination with rifampin (orally) are used until lameness and swelling improves, and then therapy with orally administered antimicrobials such as trimethoprim sulfa or rifampin are continued to prevent relapse. The time to resolution reported in one study was approximately 35 days
- Physical therapy, including hydrotherapy, hand walking, and leg wraps, as well as NSAIDs are recommended.

Biosecurity issues for receiving animals
--------------------------------
Once horses are recovered and there is no drainage from abscesses no precautions should be needed to reduce the risk these horses pose for spread of infection. There is no practical way to eliminating the bacteria from soil.

Zoonotic potential
--------------
There exist a few reports of human illness through working with infected sheep, mostly in Australian sheep shearers who had open wounds on their hands and developed axillary lymphadenitis. One veterinary student from California developed pneumonia following exposure to an infected horse, presumably from inhalation of the bacteria from a contaminated environment."
