Uncertain Outcome of a Delayed Inquest into the Death of Young CJD Victim
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Relatives expressed disappointment after a coroner ruled that a young girl
diagnosed with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), was likely to have died of
a form of CJD [i.e., sporadic CJD unrelated to that associated with bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle [i.e., variant CJD; indexed in
ProMED-mail as CJD (new var.) - Mod.CP.
The girl died at the age of 20, after lying in a coma for 4 and one half
years. Coroner John Hughes said that the evidence was unclear, but
suggested that she died from sporadic CJD. Sporadic CJD has not been linked
to BSE-infected cattle and normally affects people in their sixties. The
girl's grandmother, who had looked after her since she was a small child,
had been pressing for a verdict of death due to infection by variant CJD.
She told the North East Wales Coroner's Court in Flint how she first
noticed symptoms in her granddaughter at the age of 16 (she is believed to
be the youngest person in Wales to have died of the disease). From that
point on, she said the young girl turned from the "perfect teenage
daughter" into a moody and depressed wreck. Her health had been excellent
until March 1993. She was always tall and slim but ate everything in sight.
Then she started losing weight and began to look anorexic. "She started
falling, like you see cows with BSE staggering on television." She kept
asking "What's happening to me, mum?"
According to Professor James Ironside of the National CJD Surveillance
Unit, this case was "unique," and tests showed signs of both [sporadic CJD
and variant CJD. "Our understanding of the case is not complete. It is one
of the most unusual and difficult cases I have ever come across," he
explained. "The characteristics of the disease suffered by the young girl
do not fall neatly into any category. The investigations that we have
performed so far would indicate that this case, unique as it is, has more
similarities to sporadic CJD than to variant CJD."
The young girl was initially admitted to Wrexham Maelor Hospital in Aug
1993. Shortly after being moved to the Walton Neurological Centre in
Liverpool, she fell into a coma. Never regaining consciousness, she died in
Nov 1997. The inquest was told that at the time of her death the girl's
brain was so damaged as to look like that "of a 90-year-old person who had
undergone severe neurological damage." The [grandmother told the coroner
that a doctor had told her that her granddaughter had spongiform
encephalopathy.
Coroner John Hughes explained that the reason for the 4-year delay in
convening the inquest was because [the grandmother wanted both the results
of [the national inquiry into the BSE [outbreak and medical tests into
CJD to be made public first before any hearing. Mr Hughes returned a
verdict of death by natural causes and concluded that the victim had died
of bronchial pneumonia caused by CJD. "I ask you to recognize that I take
this step simply on the weight of evidence before the court," he said. He
went on to say that "new knowledge can confound us all" and said if new
evidence came to light he would petition the Home Secretary to have the
inquest reopened.
