[1] South Korea, 13th case confirmed - media report

South Korea reported 1 more confirmed case of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome on Saturday, raising the total number of people infected with the disease to 13.

The latest infected person is the husband of the 12th confirmed patient, according to the Health Ministry. He was in the same hospital where the country's 1st MERS case was reported to take care of his ill wife.

The ministry explained that the new patient does not seem to have contracted the disease from his wife but from Patient No. 1 since she was not showing suspected symptoms at the time. He was later admitted to the same hospital after coming down with a high fever and other symptoms. He has been placed in isolation after testing positive for the virus, the ministry said.

Of the total 13 patients, 10 were reported in the hospital where the country's 1st MERS case was confirmed on [20 May 2015]. It has temporarily closed its doors as many medical staff members have been placed in quarantine and are being closely monitored as they came in contact with infected patients.

MERS is a viral respiratory illness that is fairly new to humans, with only 1154 reported cases in 24 countries since the 1st case was confirmed in Saudi Arabia in 2012. There is no vaccine or treatment for the disease, which has a very high fatality rate of about 40 percent.

Anxiety is mounting here as the number of MERS patients seems to be increasing fast in recent days. On Friday [29 May 2015], 5 people were diagnosed with MERS, including a South Korean traveler in China.

Rumors and fearful comments about MERS and how it is transmitted are circulating through social network services, apparently reflecting growing worries about the virus.

The ministry said it will take "stern" action, including launching police investigations, against those who intentionally spread groundless rumors about the disease.

South Korea reported its 1st MERS case on [20 May 2015].

[With most of the early reports of newly confirmed cases in South Korea coming from media reports, it has been a bit challenging to keep a clean tally of the cases. The below WHO report in section [5] is very helpful in clarifying the earlier reported cases.

Additionally, Sharon Saunders of FluTrackers (https://flutrackers.com) has shared a link to the FluTrackers line-listing of cases involved in the current Korean outbreak:
https://flutrackers.com/forum/forum/novel-coronavirus-ncov-mers-2012-2014/novel-coronavirus-who-chp-wpro-ecdc-oie-fao-moa-reports-and-updates/south-korea-coronavirus/732065-south-korea-coronavirus-mers-case-list-including-imported-and-exported-cases. This listing contains links to the media and WHO reports providing information on each of the cases and is very helpful.

According to the above media report, in the past 24 hours there has been 1 newly confirmed case of MERS-CoV in South Korea, bringing the total number of cases reported by South Korea to 13, with all 13 cases currently representing 2 generations of cases -- generation 1 being the index case who had traveled in the Middle East prior to onset of illness upon return to South Korea (see section [5] below for reminder details of his travels), and generation 2 all being contacts of the index case in either his family or in the hospital environments where he was treated primarily before he was diagnosed as having been infected with the MERS-CoV. Counting the case that was imported into China from South Korea, the index case in South Korea is now directly responsible for 13 secondary cases... circumstantial evidence of a superspreader. There are still 4 more days until the accepted incubation period has ended (14 days) since the diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection was made, hence it would not be surprising if there were some additional cases identified. Hopefully appropriate respiratory precautions were taken with the remaining cases so that 3rd-generation transmission will have been prevented.

[2] China (Hong Kong), challenges in contact tracing - media report
Date: 30 May 2015
Source: Global Post / Xinhua [edited]
http://www.globalpost.com/article/6565569/2015/05/30/two-people-refuse-go-mers-quarantine


2 Korean nationals having close contact with a Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) patient who passed through Hong Kong are refusing to go into quarantine, said Health Secretary Ko Wing-man.

The 2 Korean nationals are among 18 plane passengers who sat close to the MERS patient, probably against medical advice, Ko said.

Hong Kong's health authorities have made plans for the 18 plane passengers to go into quarantine for 2 weeks at the Lady MacLehose Holiday Village in Sai Kung. But 2 of them are refusing to be tested and isolated, Ko said, adding that authorities can only contact them by phone.

Ko said the Immigration Department is tracking them down, and the government could force them to be quarantined using Hong Kong laws.

As the incubation period of the disease could be more than 10 days, the 2 could spread the deadly virus, he added.

The 44-year-old South Korean MERS patient flew from Seoul to Hong Kong on Tuesday [26 May 2015] before heading to the Chinese mainland by bus. He is thought to have contracted the disease from his father, and traveled against the advice of doctors. He is now at a mainland hospital in Huizhou of Guangdong Province, south China.

MERS was 1st identified in humans in 2012. The virus is similar to that which causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS.
The World Health Organization has reported more than 1000 cases of MERS globally and more than 400 deaths.

[The above media report highlights the challenges inherent in contact tracing when the contacts are in denial about possible disease exposure, risk, and do not wish to be found and placed under quarantine. A reflection of human nature that has accompanied many of the more serious disease outbreaks such as SARS, Ebola and MERS-CoV. That being said, as a reminder, Hong Kong dealt with a large-scale outbreak of SARS in 2003 and has had experience with quarantines and the challenges of implementing them. - Mod.MPP]

As of 12 noon today, 30 May 2015 there have been a total of:
1014 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection including
445 deaths
561 recoveries and
8 cases currently active including 1 case on home isolation.

In the past 24 hours there have been
4 newly confirmed cases and
3 newly reported fatalities

Information on newly confirmed cases (4 cases):
1- Hufoof: 57-year-old Saudi female, non-healthcare worker, currently in stable condition, history of contact with other case(s) in either healthcare environment or in the community.

2- Hufoof: 48-year-old Saudi male, non-healthcare worker, currently in stable condition, history of contact with other case(s) in either healthcare environment or in the community.

3- Hufoof: 50-year-old Saudi female, non-healthcare worker, reported as a fatality at time of initial confirmation report, history of contact with other case(s) in either the healthcare environment or in the community.

4- Hufoof: 43-year-old Saudi male, non-healthcare worker, currently in critical condition, history of contact with other case(s) in either the healthcare environment or in the community.

Information on newly reported deaths (3 fatalities):

1- Hufoof: 70-year-old Saudi male non-healthcare worker, history of pre-existing co-morbidities [reported as a newly confirmed case on 29 May 2015 at which time was noted to be in critical condition. At time of initial report was noted to have had contact with other case(s) in either the healthcare environment or in the community. - Mod.MPP]

2- Taif: 65-year-old Saudi male, non-healthcare worker, history of pre-existing co-morbidities [reported as a newly confirmed case on 26 May 2015 at which time was noted to be in critical condition in the ICU.

[Cases are continuing to occur in Saudi Arabia, and during the past 3 days there have been 8 newly confirmed cases reported, with 7 of the 8 reported from Hufoof. According to social media reports, it appears as though the current outbreak ongoing in Hufoof is a hospital-based outbreak, as well as having involved a large extended family household in the early stages. Since the 1st case in this current outbreak was reported on 20 Apr 2015, there have been a total of 18 cases reported from Hufoof, of which 12 gave a history of contact with other case(s) in either the healthcare environment or in the community. It will be interesting to see results of epidemiologic studies identifying the chains of transmission that have led to the 18 cases. It would also be of interest to know how many of the cases were household contacts vs in-hospital contacts. Might one of our readers have detailed information on this that can be shared?

Of note is that the 1st "large" healthcare-associated outbreak in Saudi Arabia occurred in Al Hasa province, of which Hufoof is the capital city. (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Ahsa_Governorate#Main_cities for details). Is there yet another hospital-based outbreak in the same province? If so, what is different about this current outbreak from the earlier outbreak that has led to hospital-based transmission?

A map showing the location of Hufoof in Saudi Arabia can be found at today's source URL. - Mod.MPP]

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - China 30 May 2015
-------------------
On 29 May 2015, the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) of China notified WHO of one confirmed case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

Details of the case are as follows:

The case is a 44-year-old male from the Republic of Korea. The patient is the son of the 3rd MERS-CoV case and the younger brother of the 4th MERS-CoV case that were reported in a previous DON on 30 May [2015] [see section [5] below]. He developed symptoms on 21 May [2015]. The patient flew to China, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on 26 May [2015] and subsequently travelled to Huizhou through point of entry in Shenzhen City, Guangdong Province. The local health authority found him on 27 May [2015] and immediately transferred him to a designated hospital for isolation. He tested positive for MERS-CoV on 29 May [2015].

The Chinese Government has taken the following surveillance and control measures:

- Actively treating the patient and strengthening hospital infection control measures;
- Testing of the patient samples and sequencing the virus and ensuring laboratory biosafety;
- Strengthening of the emergency surveillance, in particular fever screening in outpatient settings;
- Strengthening tracing, management and health monitoring of close contacts;
- Ensuring risk communication to the public.

Globally, WHO has been notified of 1148 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 431 related deaths.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - Republic of Korea 30 May 2015
----------------------
Between 26 and 29 May 2015, the National IHR Focal Point of the Republic of Korea notified WHO of additional confirmed cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). This DON describes the 8 additional cases and provides an update on the 3 cases of MERS-CoV infection reported in a previous DON on 24 May [2015].

[The 2 WHO reports above are helpful in detailing the confirmed cases through official data. It clarifies the current situation of the South Korea-related outbreak as presently representing 2 generations of infection as mentioned in my comment following section [1] above. It will be of interest to learn the postulated (or possibly documented) route of transmission in the hospital ward where much of the exposure/transmission appears to have occurred. Was the index case treated with nebulizers for respiratory compromise felt to be bronchospasm related? The use of nebulizers might have facilitated the aerosolization of infected/infective material and led to further spread in the ward environment. It will be of interest to see the physical layout of the ward, showing the location of the index case and of the secondary cases. - Mod.MPP]
