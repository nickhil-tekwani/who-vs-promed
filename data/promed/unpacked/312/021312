Three children died of smallpox in [Thari Mirwah taluka (sub-district)] in Khairpur district. 3 children [names withheld - Mod.CP] died at village Ajeeb Dasti near Thari Mirwah. According to villagers, a total of 7 children died during the last 48 hours in different villages, but the health department or district administration are still unaware in this regard. They said due to poor services of the health department, medicines are stolen from health centres while the district administration is also not paying attention in this regard.

They have demanded dispatch of doctor teams to their areas as several people including children are suffering from smallpox disease and the people are scared of the rising death toll.

Some cases of measles have reportedly claimed lives of 8 children in the town of Thari Mirwah in Khairpur during the past one week. 2 of those who died were 5 and the rest under 5 years of age. [2 of the 5 had the same names as 2 of the children identified in part [1] above, who likewise resided in a village near the town of Thari Mirwah. - Mod.CP]

The people of the area have appealed to the provincial Health Department to take notice of the outbreak of measles, which has already claimed 8 lives in a week. Meanwhile, a team of the Health Department visited the area and collected blood samples of some of those suffering from the disease. The people of the area have not heard from the team since then.

[Khairpur is a district in Sindh province of Pakistan. It can be located in the map of Sindh province at http://pakistan360degrees.com/category/general-information-about-pakistan/descriptive-maps-of-pakistan/.

Undoubtedly these contradictory reports refer to the same incident. In the absence of a description of the illness a precise diagnosis cannot be proposed with confidence. The suggested diagnosis of smallpox in the 1st report cannot be sustained since this disease has been eradicated and the last confirmed case was identified in Somalia in 1977 (http://www.who.int/csr/disease/smallpox/en/).

There is precedent for misdiagnosing measles as smallpox in Sindh province, Pakistan (see ProMED-mail post: Unexplained deaths, measles? - Pakistan (Sindh): RFI 20020401.3854). Currently measles is widespread throughout Pakistan with significant mortality. Chickenpox is another childhood disease, which by name and symptoms might be confused with smallpox (see http://www.cdc.gov/chickenpox/about/complications.html). Further information is awaited. - Mod.CP
