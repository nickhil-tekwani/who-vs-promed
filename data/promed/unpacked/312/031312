[Re the previous post on this subject -- see 1st ProMED ref. at end]
I find this outbreak unsettling and these statements not only lacking
in the reassurance which they appear to seek to impart, but downright
scary. Several obvious holes can be found in them, as reported. Among
them may be the following:
1. Perhaps least gaping of these [holes] is the fact that, had any
inapparently infected] person shedding _E. coli_ O157 caused
contamination of any packaging and/or ingredient by, let's say, the
unhygienic donning of gloves following a less-than-adequate
handwashing following a toilet visit at work, his/her carriage and
excretion of the bacterium may well have been so transient as to avoid
detection by the time any post-outbreak tests, however sensitive, were
carried out on him/her. From the above, it would seem that this
possibility was not examined. Therefore, a recurrence seems perfectly
possible.
2. Had some low-level contamination been introduced from the chicken,
such may have been its dilution that very few consumers managed to
ingest an infecting dose. Poultry (layer hens in particular) are
almost certainly potential transmission vectors of VTEC on farms.
(Dipineto L, Santaniello A, Fontanella, M, et al: Presence of shiga
toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ 0157:H7 in living layer hens. Lett
Appl Microbiol 43:293-295.
If that were the case, then the apparent complacence of the
statements suggests that it might very easily happen again, perhaps,
as no investigation into this possibility has been suggested to have
occurred.
3. That last quoted statement from the FSA spokesperson, "All
necessary action was taken to protect consumers. There is no evidence
of a continuing threat to public safety and there have been no new
cases", suggests that there is no evidence (before the FSA) of any
continuing threat to public safety because there have been no new cases.
4. Why some people may fall ill with VTEC infection whilst others
remain healthy having ingested a similar or larger dose remains very
unclear, I believe, as do the reasons why some folk may develop HUS
[hemolytic uremic syndrome] following ingestion of a dose that has not
been large enough to even sicken somebody else.
5. In the recent Danish non-O157 VTEC outbreak [see 2nd ProMED ref.
below], the median age of the victims was given as 2 years. It seems
possible that none of the infecting/infectious wraps was eaten by
anyone so young. Had they been, then the statement that "I can confirm
that it is likely that a small number of packs of a product we made
over 3 weeks ago was the cause of a small outbreak of food poisoning
in which a number of people were taken ill, but none seriously" might
well not have been the case -- as I suspect it was not.
6. Adequate, appropriate handwashing following toilet visits
continues to be under-emphasized worldwide, in my opinion. And, while
one may have justifiable doubts about the culinary skills and hygiene
employed by occasional, male barbecue cooks at state fairs, summer
camps, on picnics and, perhaps, in some prisons, there is every
reason to fear that hand hygiene, especially following any toileting,
may be less than ideal in those settings and contribute to the
outbreaks of salmonellosis, norovirus and VTEC that we read about in
ProMED-mail during our northern summer.
Much of the public remains ignorant of fecal-oral infections, what
they are, and how they occur. I'd bet a large sum of money that the
majority of the public in your jurisdiction does not realize how
norovirus is more commonly transmitted, for instance. This is tragic.
The cost in human life and suffering, in healthcare, in lost work
days, in taxes and in painful embarrassment is incalculable. The
remedies are obvious, if not always polite.

[ProMED thanks Tom Kelly for his comments. The source of the
contamination may also have been from lettuce or some other vegetable.
