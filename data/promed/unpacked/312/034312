University of Florida [UF] veterinarians have reported a recent spike in leptospirosis cases in dogs treated at UF's Small Animal Hospital. This emerging bacterial disease affects multiple animal species as well as humans. "In a typical year, we see almost no cases of leptospirosis in dogs at UF," says Carsten Bandt, DVM, an assistant professor of emergency medicine and critical care at the UF College of Veterinary Medicine, in a university release. Bandt serves as chief of the hospital's emergency and critical care service. "We have now seen 12 cases, just within the past 6 months."

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention doesn't collect data on dogs, although the information may be reportable in animals in some states, says Christopher Cox, a health communications specialist with the CDC, in the UF release.

Cox says between 100 and 200 human cases of leptospirosis are identified annually in the US, with around half of those occurring in Hawaii.

"Although incidence in the US is relatively low, leptospirosis is considered to be the most widespread zoonotic disease in the world," he says.

Although the severity of the disease varies widely in people and in pets, leptospirosis can cause serious liver and kidney damage and can be fatal if it is left untreated, says Bandt.

"Although frequently seen in many animal species and in humans around the world, including the United States, there have been very few cases of pets diagnosed with this disease in the last decade in Florida," says Bandt. The bacterium that causes leptospirosis is transmitted through the urine of infected animals, including rodents, mice, and other pests, according to the CDC. These bacteria live in soil and water for weeks to months. Several strains of the bacterium cause disease in dogs, although prevalence varies by region. Animals that spend lots of time outside, particularly in areas frequented by wildlife, are most at risk. Signs of leptospirosis in dogs and humans vary and can be nonspecific, but dogs have demonstrated a more consistent range of clinical signs, Cox says.

Those typically include lethargy, depression, lack of interest in eating, vomiting, fever, abdominal pain, and changes in urination frequency. A dog showing these signs may or may not have leptospirosis, but pet owners should still contact their veterinarian immediately, Bandt adds.

"All canine patients with acute kidney injury should be tested for leptospirosis," he says. "If caught early, leptospirosis responds well to antibiotics, but if not, serious and sometimes fatal disease can quickly follow."

Several vaccines protect against multiple strains of leptospirosis, but historically these vaccines have not been widely used in Florida because of the low frequency of the disease in dogs.

Because leptospirosis is zoonotic, families with infected pets should be careful handling the urine of these animals, Bandt added.

For more information on this increase in leptospirosis, veterinarians can contact the UF Small Animal Hospital at (352) 392-2235.

[Leptospirosis vaccine used to be combined into a core vaccine that was recommended for dogs. Then perhaps 10 years or more ago, because of the possibility of a reaction in some animals, a decision was made to remove leptospirosis from the combination vaccine. As a result, we have an entirely naive population of dogs so we should expect to see more cases. About 3 years ago a new vaccine was released for leptospirosis.

With an increase in cases, an increase in reporting, and a new vaccine, why are veterinarians not using it, or why are clients declining the vaccine for their animals?

Leptospirosis (lepto for short) is a serious bacterial disease of dogs, multiple animal species and humans that occurs in countries around the world. In the United States, it has become an increasing concern in recent years, especially in cities and suburbs. The main reason is growing populations of wildlife, like raccoons and skunks, which carry disease and infect dogs indirectly. Dogs can get sick even if they never come into direct contact with infected animals.

Lepto has been diagnosed in all types of dogs and all breeds and sizes are at risk. Lepto can be a very serious disease and can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated early. It generally attacks a dog's liver and kidneys, and can lead to organ damage or failure. But if caught early, it responds well to antibiotics, and fortunately, vaccination can help prevent the disease.

Leptospirosis is caused by the bacterium _Leptospira interrogans_, part of a group of corkscrew-shaped bacteria called spirochetes. Leptospira spirochetes are further divided into multiple "subfamilies" called serovars or strains. Around the world, there are more than 200 serovars of leptospira. Although there are many serovars, only a few are known to cause disease in dogs. Newer vaccines contain 4 serovars for protection against today's most common serovars. Those 4 serovars and the most common hosts are listed below.

Lepto serovars are maintained in nature by "reservoir hosts" that have subclinical infections and shed the organisms for long periods of time. Dogs can be reservoir hosts for the serovar Canicola. Many academics consider Canicola the least frequently isolated serovar in dogs. Dogs are "incidental hosts" and generally develop more severe clinical disease for serovars Grippotyphosa, Pomona, and Icterohaemorrhagiae.

_L. interrogans_ Grippotyphosa hosts: raccoon, skunk, opossum, small rodents, and squirrels. Currently most common and increasing; leading infectious cause of acute renal failure in dogs.
_L. interrogans_ Pomona hosts: skunk, raccoon, opossum, cow, pig, and deer. Currently common and increasing; leading infectious cause of acute renal failure in dogs.
_L. interrogans_ Icterohaemorrhagiae hosts: rat and pig. Traditionally common and decreasing, possibly due to widespread vaccination containing this serovar; can cause severe liver disease and jaundice.
_L. interrogans_ Canicola host: dog. Traditionally common and decreasing, possibly due to widespread vaccination containing this serovar; can cause severe liver disease and jaundice.
