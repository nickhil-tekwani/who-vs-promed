PASTEURELLA PNEUMONIA, BIG HORN SHEEP - USA (4)
===============================================

Subject: Pasteurella pneumonia, Big Horn Sheep - USA (3)

It seems to me that the idea of "stress of capture" causing/
predisposing the animals to illness cannot be epidemiologically
discriminated from "grouping of susceptibles". For humans, we
know that child day care predisposes children to higher rates
of respiratory and intestinal illness. We know the children have
good immune systems, so the belief is that the increased risk is
due to the crowding of children. Putting a group of children -- or
animals -- together promotes spread of a pathogen even/especially
when only one is carrying it.
