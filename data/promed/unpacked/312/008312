The flu is hitting the state [of Washington] hard, and already 13 people have died from the flu. Nearly half of them were in King and Snohomish counties. So far this fall, influenza has killed 4 people in King County, including 2 young children.

On Monday [5 Dec 2022], Snohomish County announced that 2 people had died from the flu there. Infectious disease experts are expecting the worst as the holidays approach.

The flu is hitting especially early this year [2022]. And that is what is setting off alarm bells in the medical community and keeping pharmacies busy.

"My sister has a friend who's in the hospital right now," said [LR], standing outside of Katterman's Pharmacy on Sand Point Way.

She says her sister's friend and news reports about the flu have scared her. "My sister got upset with [me] this morning for not having my vaccine," admitted [LR]. "And so, I am here."

Dr. Eric Chow is chief of Public Health, Seattle & King County's Communicable Disease Epidemiology Division.

"What I'm seeing right now is alarming," he said. Chow says this is the worst influenza outbreak in at least 4 years. "Since the beginning of September [2022], we've seen surges in respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, infections," said Chow. "On the heels of that, we've seen early increased activity and influenza. And we're always concerned about the return of COVID-19 and increased activity, especially how it will impact communities as well as put additional stress on our healthcare facilities."

Just 3 weeks ago, King County laboratories were reporting that 13.2% of samples were coming back positive for influenza. It was up again the next week. The last time the numbers were reported, nearly 1/3 of the tests were positive for the flu.

"That's why we have to do our due diligence," said Chow. "Get our vaccines, reduce the chance of infection as much as we can."

"It doesn't sound good," said [LR]. "I think I'll just wear my mask and try to stay home a lot."

According to Chow, [LR] has the right idea. Chow says he knows no one wants to hear that, but you need to mask up, wash your hands, and isolate whenever you feel sick.

This wave of the flu could go on for some time. The flu usually doesn't peak until February.

This flu season's ferocious start has given way to record-shattering levels of transmission and massive strains on the American health system.

In the week ending 26 Nov [2022], more than 34 000 positive flu tests were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from labs around the US, as shown in the orange line on the chart below [see chart at source URL]. That's more positive flu tests than have been reported in any single week during any flu season on record, going back as far as 1997.

The trajectory dwarfs the past 6 flu seasons, including the relatively bad 2019-2020 one that immediately preceded the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Some portion of this steep rise in cases is related to the fact that more people are being tested for the flu than in previous years. Over the month of November [2022], about twice as many flu tests were done at clinical labs nationwide as during the same period last year (about 540 000 versus 265 000). More testing means more cases will get picked up.

However, there are corroborating warning signs that this is truly a bad season. Flu hospitalizations have been off the charts and are rising quickly. In a press conference Monday [5 Dec 2022], CDC director Rochelle Walensky said there have already been 78 000 flu hospitalizations this season, or nearly 17 out of every 100 000 Americans. That's "the highest we've seen at this time of year in a decade," she said. In keeping with past trends, the
highest hospitalization rates are among adults 65 and older. Chart showing 2022 flu hospitalizations are much higher than they normally are at this time of year.

What's making these high hospitalization rates particularly concerning is their overlap with surges in other viruses causing many people to get sick enough to require admission. One of those is RSV, which has been packing pediatric hospitals for more than 6 weeks. And while Walensky noted there were signals RSV transmission was slowing in parts of the country, COVID-19 hospitalizations recently began to tick upward.

An important reason for the convergence of these viral waves: low population-wide levels of antibodies against many common colds and the flu. Pandemic-era preventive measures delayed 1st-time infections among many children, which, while good for individual children's health, meant a higher number than usual were susceptible to severe infection when those preventive measures were lifted.

Americans are also not doing everything they can to protect themselves from respiratory viruses: only a quarter of adults and 40% of children have received a flu shot this season, and 15% of adults eligible for an updated COVID-19 booster dose have received one.

That represents important lost opportunities for prevention: This year's [2022] flu shot is expected to be a particularly effective one, noted Walensky, as it is a good match to the circulating strains of the flu, which vary year to year. However, it only works if people get it.

Additionally, many of the preventive measures proven effective during the COVID-19 pandemic are going broadly unused, even though they would also be helpful in preventing the spread of other respiratory illnesses. There has been no great push to implement a high standard of ventilation and filtration inside US buildings. Only one-quarter of Americans have changed their behavior to reduce viral exposure. And a minority of Americans frequently wear masks outside their homes.

Amid the flu surge, medication shortages are complicating efforts to prevent severe disease and treat bacterial infections that can follow in the wake of some flu infections. Additionally, staffing shortages that intensified as a consequence of the pandemic have put pediatric hospitals in the position of caring for a massive wave of sick children with even fewer resources than they had before. Although pediatric healthcare organizations called for a national emergency declaration to support their response to this surge, none has been forthcoming.

In the US, flu infections normally peak between December and February. It remains to be seen whether the current early flu surge will translate to an early flu peak, or instead foretells a protracted period of extraordinarily high viral transmission, with increasingly crushing burdens on healthcare workers as more people get severely ill.

After a punishing few years, it's not clear how much more strain the American healthcare system can absorb.

Hospital cases of influenza in England are up almost 50% in a week as the illness circulates more widely among the population, figures show.

Estimates suggest the age range between 15 and 44 is the most severely affected, with 24.3% of laboratory samples from this group testing positive, according to the UK Health Security Agency.

Samples from all age groups testing positive are at 14.3% in the week to 4 Dec [2022], up from 12.5% the previous week. Hospital admission rates are highest for those aged between 75 and 84, at 9.3 for every 100 000 people, followed by children under 5 (6.6) and over-85s (6.5).

The overall level of flu is still estimated to be below the same point 3 years ago, in the pre-COVID winter of 2019-2020.

But vaccination among pregnant women is at 30.5%, down 3 percentage points on this stage last year [2021-2022] and about 4 points lower than in 2020-2021.

Inoculation among those aged between 2 and 3 is 8 percentage points lower than last year [2021-2022] and just over 14 points below the equivalent level in 2020-2021.

Just over 1/3 (35.4%) of 2-year-olds have received a flu vaccine, along with a slightly higher proportion (37.6%) of 3-year-olds.

All children aged 2 and 3 are eligible for a flu nasal spray vaccine, which is being offered by local GPs.

In total, about 33 million people in England can have free flu vaccination this year [2022], including everyone aged 50 and over, all primary school-aged children, and some secondary school-aged children.

The vaccine is also being offered to pregnant women, people in care homes, frontline health and social care staff, carers, those aged 6-49 with a specified health condition, and household contacts of people with weakened immune systems.

"With winter now upon us, we are seeing flu circulating more widely," said Dr Conall Watson, the health agency's consultant epidemiologist. "The NHS [National Health Service] frontline has already delivered millions of vaccines to those most at risk from what can be a deadly virus.

"With Christmas fast approaching, if you are eligible and have not yet been vaccinated, it can take a fortnight or so for the flu vaccine to provide protection.

"Nobody wants to see their loved ones sick or in hospital with flu over Christmas, so to ensure your family are ready to enjoy the festive season together, don't hesitate and book your vaccine today."

Doctors in the UAE have noticed a sharp rise in coughs and colds in the last month, after a year of hardly any patients suffering from common viruses such as flu.

Figures from NHS England show there were an average of 712 flu cases a day in hospitals last week, up 48% from 482 the previous week.

The figure for the 1st week of December last year was 31.

A British Columbia pediatric cardiac surgeon is calling for more transparency and urgency from public officials after the flu-related deaths of at least 6 children and youth in the province this season.

"Parents need more knowledge (because) knowledge is essential in an emergency. What we have is ignorance, and ignorance is deadly in this situation," Dr. Sanjiv Gandhi said in an interview Friday [9 Dec 2022].

The British Columbia Centre for Disease Control said in a statement Friday [9 Dec 2022] that the deadly spike in acute respiratory illness is showing signs of stabilizing.

The centre reported influenza A was the most detected virus in BC last week, while wastewater tests indicate a slow increase in COVID-19 infections.

It said that while test positivity remains high for both influenza and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, the numbers have levelled off in the past week.

Gandhi said the 24% positivity rate that the centre is reporting for influenza A is still "incredibly high."

"Even if that positivity rate is the same week to week, which meets the definition of stability, it's stable in a very bad place," he said. "I don't think one can take any solace in those numbers."

On Thursday [8 Dec 2022], British Columbia's Health Ministry announced a "blitz" of walk-in flu clinics that will open across the province Friday through Sunday. Flu vaccines are free to all kids aged 6 months and older in BC.

While the province is on track for a record number of people getting their flu shot this year [2022], Dr. Penny Ballem with BC Vaccine Operations said Monday [5 Dec 2022] that only 20% of children under 11 and about 15% of teens have been vaccinated.

The government has said it will be using its provincial health registry to contact parents in an attempt to increase that number.

Gandhi said that vaccinations are an important part of the solution, but the province should also be implementing more stringent measures, like mask mandates in schools and other public places.

"I think the vaccination push is fine, but I think it's a little bit late, and I think it doesn't come with the urgency that it needs to come with," he said.

"This is the March 2020 for kids, and it's worse than March 2020 was for the senior citizens," he said, referring to the dramatic COVID-19 death toll for seniors at the start of the pandemic.

"Dead kids are dead kids (and) there's just nothing more horrific than a dead child."

Friday's [9 Feb 2022] update from the CDC comes a day after provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said pediatric flu deaths would be included in the centre's weekly updates.

"Early findings indicate some of the children experienced secondary bacterial infections contributing to severe illness, which can be a complication of influenza," Henry said in a statement. "It is important to know that death associated with influenza in previously healthy children continues to be rare."

The recent flu deaths among children mark a departure from the average 2-3 recorded annually among children in the province between 2015 and 2019, data from the BC Coroners Service shows.

The 6 young people who died with influenza include one child under 5, 3 aged 5-9, and 2 youths aged 15-19 years.

[The reports above highlight an early surge in influenza cases this year [2022], with higher number of cases and deaths being reported. Influenza season generally peaks during January or February, while there has been an unusual increase reported in many countries. Use of masks, social distancing, and hand hygiene practices along with annual influenza vaccination should be promoted, especially among the high-risk population groups. - Mod.UBA
