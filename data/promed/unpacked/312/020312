FOOD POISONING, STAPHYLOCOCCAL - USA (TEXAS)

In November, there was a large _Staphylococcus aureus_ food borne outbreak
in Beaumont, Texas, among conference attendees. Some ProMED-mail
subscribers have asked for more information, and although this material
will be presented in professional meetings later I can share the following.

On 11/12/97 a large foodborne illness outbreak occurred in Beaumont. More
than 200 people of approximately 600 who ate a particular lunch buffet
experienced violent onset with nausea, chills, vomiting, diarrhea,
disorientation, and muscle aches. More than 100 persons were seen by EMS
personnel on site at the convention center or transported to local
emergency departments in 3 different hospitals.
Left over food samples were obtained by local sanitarians and sent to the
Texas Department of Health (TDH) Food Laboratory. Clinical specimens were
provided by hospital labs from ill patients and hotel kitchen staff and
sent to TDH lab for comparison studies. Staphylococcal enterotoxin was
found in 3 of 5 samples of a pasta dish tested at TDH lab, and
_Staphylococcus aureus_ grew from all 5 samples. All other food items
tested negative. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis comparisons between food
items, kitchen staff, and ill patients showed that one food handler had
positive cultures for a strain of _S. aureus_ indistinguishable from
positive cultures from ill patients and food items. Epidemiological
analysis of food histories from ill patients and well controls also
implicated the pasta dish.
Hazard Analysis of Critical Control Points analysis by local sanitarians
identified problems with the temperature gauges on hot holding units in the
kitchen. Kitchen staff have been retrained in safe food handling
procedures and the malfunctioning gauges have since been repaired.
Details of the outbreak and the various methodologies used to conduct this
investigation will be shared elsewhere.
