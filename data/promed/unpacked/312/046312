"The increase in congenital syphilis is particularly concerning," said Dr Karen Smith, the state Health Officer and director of the state Department of Public Health. [See ProMED-mail post Syphilis - USA (09): (CA) pregnant women, congenital, rising incidence 20150715.3512635.]

The North Coast has skipped that upward trend, according to the Humboldt County Department of Health and Human Services. Of more concern locally is the marked increase in cases of chlamydia and gonorrhea, both sexually transmitted diseases. "We definitely have a large increase in the number of cases of chlamydia and gonorrhea," Gordon said, "locally, regionally, and across California."

In April [2015], the Humboldt County Department of Health and Human Services reported that the number of gonorrhea cases in 2015 -- up to that point -- was twice as many as reported in 2014. Both can also be spread from a mother to her newborn during childbirth. The increase in cases has become particularly noticeable in the past 2 years, Gordon said. There's also been a marked increase in both since January [2015] on the North Coast.

Researchers haven't been able to scientifically pinpoint the uptick in chlamydia and gonorrhea cases. One theory behind the increase is the use of apps that facilitate anonymous sexual hook-ups, Gordon said.

Both chlamydia and gonorrhea are readily treatable with antibiotics, Gordon said. They share symptoms as well: urethra discharge, abdominal pain, and a burning sensation or pain while urinating. Roughly one-half of those who have contracted chlamydia and gonorrhea won't know they have the disease because they don't develop symptoms. If untreated, gonorrhea can cause pelvic inflammatory disease in women and pain in the testicles for men. In rare cases, untreated gonorrhea can lead to infertility for both men and women, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Untreated chlamydia can also cause pelvic inflammatory disease in women and testicle pain for men. In rare cases, men can become sterile from untreated chlamydia, according to the CDC.

[The news report above says that there has been an increase in cases of chlamydia infection and gonorrhea in Humboldt County, as well as other counties that constitute the "North Coast" in the US state of California. The report says that the increase may have been facilitated by use of apps that allow anonymous sexual hook-ups [through the internet], but does characterize the cases further. ProMED-mail would appreciate more information on this outbreak from knowledgeable sources.

Humboldt County, with a population was 134 623 in 2010, is located in the US state of California along the Pacific coast, 200 miles (322 km) north of the city of San Francisco (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humboldt_County,_California). The North Coast of California is the region in Northern California that lies on the Pacific coast between San Francisco Bay and the US state of Oregon border. It commonly includes Humboldt, Mendocino, and Del Norte counties and sometimes includes 2 counties from the San Francisco Bay area, Marin and Sonoma (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Coast_(California)). A map of California counties is available at http://www.socalequest.com/map.htm.
