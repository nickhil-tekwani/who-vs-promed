Refrigerator workers in Barbosa (71 km from Aracatuba) who have felt ill for almost 2 months are suffering from Q fever. The disease is considered rare, and these would be among the 1st cases in Brazil.

The diagnosis was reported to Municipal Health of Barbosa yesterday morning [15 Mar 2015] during a visit to the municipality of the director of the Center for Strategic Information for Health Surveillance of Sao Paulo, Gizelda Katz. She was accompanied by representatives of Cerest (The Workers' Health Reference Center), the Epidemiological Surveillance group, and defense counsels Agricultural Aracatuba.

The Health Secretary of Barbosa explained that Q fever is caused by the bacterium _Coxiella burnetii_, transmitted to humans by inhalation and contact with animals. "In view of the facts, health professionals in the city were instructed to carry out the monitoring of these patients, since these Barbosa cases are among the 1st cases of an outbreak of this bacterium in Brazil," he says.

Tests found that the staff, 16 in total, had been infected with the bacterium, however, Katz said that you cannot tell when there was transmission. "The symptoms appeared in the acute phase, and the patients were treated with antimicrobials that fortunately kill this type of bacteria. Therefore, the disease will hardly [ever] develop [to be] chronic."

To report on such care, employees and representatives of the refrigerator group participated in a meeting at City Hall in the early afternoon yesterday [15 Mar 2015]. "They were told about the disease, the need for personal protective equipment, which is essential in control, and questions were answered on the subject to all present."

[A previous ProMED post (Q fever - Brazil: (MG) 20130617.1777459) stated that the 1st description of Q fever in Brazilian territory was in 1953, identified by serology in Sao Paulo. Bahia, Rio de Janeiro, and Tocantins have diagnosed cases in the past.

Q fever, often acquired by close exposure to animals, is infectious with a very low inoculum and may be aerosolized over a significant distance. _Coxiella burnetii_, the causative agent, was discovered in 1937. This organism is an agent that can be resistant to heat and desiccation and is highly infectious by the aerosol route. A single inhaled organism may produce clinical illness. Indeed, in [non-human] primates, the dose to kill 50 percent of primates was found to be 1.7 organisms (1).

Cattle, sheep, and goats are the primary reservoirs of _C. burnetii_. Infection has been noted in a wide variety of other animals, including other species of livestock and in domesticated pets. _C. burnetii_ does not usually cause clinical disease in these animals, although abortion in goats and sheep has been linked to _C. burnetii_ infection. Organisms are excreted in milk, urine, and feces of infected animals. Most importantly, during birthing, the organisms are shed in high numbers within the amniotic fluids and the placenta. Contact with contaminated wool is known to be a mode of transmission (2).

The organisms can be resistant to heat, drying, and many common disinfectants. These features enable the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment. This very stable form of _C. burnetii_ is associated with compact small cell variants of the organism that are produced during standard replication along with the less resistant large cell form, metabolically dormant and spore-like (3).

Infection of humans usually occurs by inhalation of these organisms from air that contains airborne barnyard dust contaminated by dried placental material, birth fluids, and excreta of infected herd animals. Humans are often very susceptible to the disease, and very few organisms may be required to cause infection.

Ingestion of contaminated milk, followed by regurgitation and inspiration of the contaminated food, is a less common mode of transmission. Other modes of transmission to humans, including tick bites and human-to-human transmission, are rare.
