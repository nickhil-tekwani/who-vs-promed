Foot-and-mouth in Europe
---------------------------------
Countries all over Europe are acting urgently to try to halt the spread of
foot-and-mouth disease from its source in the UK. The European Union has
suspended livestock markets and extended a ban on the export of meat,
livestock and milk products from the UK. The tires of all vehicles entering
other EU countries from the UK must be disinfected.
Ireland
----------
First case of the disease confirmed in a flock of sheep near Jenkinstown in
County Louth on 22 Mar 2001. There is a compulsory cull of healthy animals
near the site of the disease -- by 31 Mar 2001, 23 727 sheep and 600 cattle
had been slaughtered. Irish army special forces have also been shooting
wild goats and deer which can carry the disease. There are strict border
controls on traffic entering from Northern Ireland. The movement of all
farm animals has been banned and abattoirs closed. The use of pig swill is
to be banned. Hunting has been banned, and the Six Nations Rugby matches
with Wales, England and Scotland have been postponed until next season. A
full lifting of the restrictions is not planned until 30 days after the
last confirmed foot-and-mouth case in the UK is detected.
United Kingdom
-----------------------
By 5 Apr 2001, there were 1058 confirmed cases of the disease in the UK.
Already 441 640 animals have been slaughtered, and 277 360 animals are
awaiting slaughter. Pig swill is to be banned. The European Union has
approved a request for authorization to vaccinate up to 180 000 dairy
cattle in Cumbria and Devon. By 1 Apr 2001 , no decision had been taken on
whether to go ahead. The EU Commission has lifted a ban on meat and dairy
products from Northern Ireland -- treating it separately from the rest of
the UK.
Spain
--------
Spain has slaughtered more than 500 pigs imported from the UK, and banned
the movement of goats and sheep. When France confirmed its first case of
foot-and-mouth on 13 Mar 2001, Spain immediately banned the movement of
French livestock. It is testing 66 000 animals imported from France,
including some 131 cattle imported from the affected area in France.
France
----------
France's second case of the disease was confirmed at a farm in Mitry-Mory,
east of Paris, on 23 Mar 2001, 10 days after the first, in the western
department of Mayenne. But with no new cases reported by 3 Apr 2001, the EU
relaxed export bans on French meat and dairy produce, restricting them to
the areas of the country where the disease has been found. The ban will now
apply only to the Seine-et-Marne region east of Paris, where the most
recent case was found, and to the neighboring areas of Seine Saint-Denis
and Val-D'Oise. Since the UK outbreak there has been a ban on export of all
animals at risk, and on the movement, except to abattoirs, of cattle, sheep
and pigs. There is also a ban on imports from the UK, Ireland, Belgium. The
French authorities have destroyed 20 000 sheep imported from the UK and 30
000 sheep that came into contact with UK animals. The ban on the export of
all French livestock will remain in place until 12 Apr 2001.
Belgium
------------
A pig farm at Diksmuide, western Flanders, tested negative for the disease,
after 300 animals were slaughtered as a precaution. Belgium has destroyed
1000 sheep imported from UK since 1 Feb 2001 and has halted the transport
of live goats and sheep. When the first outbreak of the disease in France
was confirmed on 13 Mar 2001, Belgium imposed an immediate ban on French
livestock imports.
The Netherlands
------------------------
[Present total is 15 or 13 -- reports in English vary. Ministry report at:
<http://www.minlnv.nl/mkz/>
This reports, inter alia, that regional intranational controls have been
set up.
A new case of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed on 30 Mar 2001, taking
the total to 11 and sparking fears that efforts to contain the disease may
have failed. Thousands of sheep, cattle, pigs and deer at farms known to do
business with the UK have been slaughtered. Another 8 ,000 animals are to
be killed in an attempt to contain the spread of the disease. The Dutch
were the first to seek -- and gain -- permission to vaccinate animals
around infected farms, to create a firebreak against the infection
spreading. The program is under way, but the discovery of new cases could
mean the policy has come too late to stop the virus leapfrogging the
firebreak and spreading from farm to farm, as it has in the UK.
Germany
-------------
Germany is investigating a possible outbreak at a pig farm in North
Rhine-Westphalia, near the Dutch border. Previous scares have proved to be
false alarms, but vets say the latest report is serious. Several German
states are preparing to vaccinate farm animals if any cases are discovered.
There is a ban on the transport of all animals at risk from foot-and-mouth
disease. Sheep, goats, cows, and pigs can only be transported in
"exceptional" cases to slaughterhouses or other farms, and police have
stepped up controls. All sheep and goats imported from the UK have been
slaughtered, and there are quarantine orders on farms thought to have been
supplied with animals from infected areas of the UK. On 13 Mar 2001,
following the first confirmed outbreak in France, North Rhine-Westphalia
announced that all sheep imported from France in the previous 3 weeks would
be destroyed. And Germany immediately banned all French livestock imports.
Airport arrivals are being monitored to ensure no meat or milk is brought
into the country.
Italy
-------
Despite several suspected cases, and the discovery of anti-bodies in some
animals imported from France, Italy has not had any cases of the disease.
Meanwhile there is a ban on the import of all animals at risk, including
non-European livestock. Sheep and pigs imported from the UK have been
impounded for tests for the disease.There are severe restrictions on animal
transport and gatherings like fairs, and circuses.
Czech Republic
---------------------
On 28 Mar 2001 the Czech Republic said it was dropping restrictions at the
border with Poland but foot-and-mouth precautions would continue along the
borders with Germany and Austria, at least until 5 Apr 2001. Airline
passengers arriving from the UK have been subject to disinfection
procedures since 2 Mar 2001.
Poland
----------
Imports of livestock from the European Union and 12 other European
countries has been banned, as has some meat and dairy imports. There are
disinfectant measures in place at borders.
Denmark
------------
Tests on a cow suspected with the disease in the north-west of the country
proved negative but several farms have been put under quarantine as a
precaution. On 28 Mar 2001, 3 suspected cases in the west of the country
also proved negative. Private food imports into Denmark have been banned
and visits to cattle farms restricted.
Norway
-----------
A British Royal Air Force squadron which had been due to join a military
exercise in Norway stayed away on the advice of veterinary authorities.
Meanwhile there is a temporary ban on traditional reindeer races, and a ban
on all events that involve bringing together hoofed animals. On 14 Mar
2001, Norway extended a ban on French livestock imports to all meat and
animal products from the European Economic Area -- the 15 European Union
countries plus Liechtenstein and Iceland.
Sweden
-----------
There is a temporary ban on traditional reindeer races, and a ban on all
events that involve bringing together hoofed animals. On 14 Mar 2001, at
the European Union-backed Food Chain 2001 Convention, in Uppsala, more than
500 animals were being locked away in winter quarters for fear they could
catch foot-and-mouth carried on the clothes of delegates.
Finland
-----------
A suspected case of the disease at a dairy farm in southern Finland turned
out to be a false alarm. Meanwhile there is a temporary ban on traditional
reindeer races, and a ban on all events that involve bringing together
hoofed animals.
Russia
----------
On 26 Mar 2001, Russia extended its ban on UK and some French meat, to the
whole of the European Union.
Addendum:
United States officials said they expected to lift the ban on raw meat
imports from the EU in stages as the risk of spreading the disease to the
USA was assessed.

Disease shadow over German
-------------------------------------
Suspected outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease in Germany have been given
the all-clear as the country manages to stave off the spread of infection
from the Netherlands. German Agriculture Minister Renate Kuenast warned
against hysteria among those convinced the infection will cross the border.
"I don't believe in saying it's getting closer and closer and thereby
contributing to panic," she said.
On Wednesday, initial tests taken at 3 suspected outbreaks in the regions
of Hesse and North Rhine-Westphalia were found to be negative. [Check site
for map.
There have been small-scale precautionary slaughters at the suspected farms
and 3km exclusion zones have been set up around any farm where animals have
shown symptoms of the disease. But the German Farmers' Union and regional
government are calling for preventative vaccinations along the Dutch border
to stave off what they see as the unavoidable spread of the infection. The
Hesse regional government has already prepared for a vaccination programme.
The regional health ministry says it already has 650 000 doses of vaccine
ready and has put in an order for 1.5 million more.
One amateur farmer has apparently already taken matters into his own hands.
Munich city councilor Bernhard Fricke reportedly faces a DM50 000 ($23 000)
for having vaccinated 3 of his sheep on an organic farm in contravention of
EU regulations.

Dutch to bring in mobile burners
----------------------------------------
A spokesman for the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture announced that 115 000
animals would have to be destroyed. The infected animals are all located in
the center of the Netherlands, around the cities of Apeldoorn, Deventer and
Zwolle. The area has been sealed off from the rest of the country. The
reason for the delay in destroying the animals is that the Dutch
authorities, under pressure from farmers, are not going to burn the animals
in fields, but are organizing mobile incinerators to visit infected farms.
Lawrence Brinkhirst, the Minister for Agriculture, says that farmers will
receive compensation for destroyed animals within a month. Meanwhile,
almost a month after the first case of foot and mouth in France, most
politicians and farmers believe that the country will be spared an epidemic.
