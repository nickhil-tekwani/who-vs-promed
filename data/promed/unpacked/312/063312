An anthrax scare at eight abortion clinics in four Midwestern states was
pronounced a hoax Monday. Tests found no evidence that any of the eight
threatening letters received on Friday and Saturday contained the deadly
bacteria or any other bacterial agent, FBI spokesman Bill Carter said.
However, tests still were being performed to identify a brownish powder
found inside at least four of the envelopes.
Even without anthrax, it is still a crime to threaten to use a weapon of
mass destruction.
The FBI said it has no suspects.
The letters were received at clinics in Indianapolis; New Albany, Ind.;
Scottsburg, Ind.; Knoxville, Tenn.; Wichita, Kan.; and Louisville, Ky. All
eight of the 3-by-5-inch white envelopes had Cincinnati postmarks.
Most of the eight clinics reopened Monday. However, the Indianapolis clinic
remained closed until Tuesday while workers received counseling and the
agency contacted frightened patients to apologize and comfort them, Planned
Parenthood spokeswoman Chrystal Struben said.
Meanwhile, a ninth clinic, also in Knoxville, received a suspicious
envelope in the mail Monday. It was not opened, but it also had a
Cincinnati postmark and appeared to be identical to the envelopes
containing the anthrax threats, said FBI Agent Scott Nowinski in Knoxville.
He said it would be sent to Washington for tests.
