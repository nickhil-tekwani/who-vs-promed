On 27 Nov 2019 California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) officials confirmed that another exposed horse on the San Bernardino County index premises first identified on [6 Nov 2019], a 12-year-old Quarter Horse mare, became febrile (displayed an elevated fever) and subsequently tested positive for equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1).

The outbreak on the index premises now involves 4 horses that have developed neurologic signs. 3 of these were euthanized due to the severity of their signs. 6 horses have become febrile and confirmed positive for EHV-1, and an additional 10 horses remain in exposed status following quarantine and implementation of enhanced biosecurity measures, including twice-daily temperature monitoring.

EHV background
--------------
Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and EHM [equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy].

In many horses, the 1st or only sign of EHV-1 infection is fever, which can go undetected. In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months) but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with the neurologic form (EHM) usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore- and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

Herpesvirus spreads easily via nose-to-nose or close contact with an infectious horse; sharing contaminated equipment including bits, buckets, and towels; or by way of clothing, hands, or equipment of people who have recently had contact with an infectious horse. Establish and maintain routine biosecurity measures, including hygiene and basic cleaning and disinfection practices to help prevent disease spread.

Current EHV-1 vaccines might reduce viral shedding but are not protective against the neurologic form of the disease. Implementing routine biosecurity practices is the best way to minimize viral spread, and the best method of disease control is disease prevention.

The California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA), in Sacramento, issued an update on 25 Nov 2019 when one additional horse on the index premise in San Bernardino County developed a fever and was confirmed positive for equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) infection.

The 11-year-old Paint stallion is the 4th horse to develop the neurologic form of EHV-1, and an additional 5 horses have developed fevers exceeding 101.5 deg F [38.6 deg C]. 3 of the neurologic horses were euthanized due to the severity of their clinical signs, and all other horses on the premises are reported as recovering. CDFA continues to monitor the outbreak.

["Equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) is ubiquitous in the environment and found in most horses all over the world. All equids are susceptible to EHV-1. The virus is not transmissible to humans.

EHV-1 infection in horses can cause respiratory disease, abortion in mares, neonatal foal death, and neurological disease. Horses are typically exposed to the virus at a young age with no serious side effects.

It is unknown what causes some horses to develop the serious neurological form of the disease. The neurological form of the disease is known as equine herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHM). In this syndrome, the EHV-1 virus damages blood vessels in the brain and spinal cord causing the various neurological clinical presentations of the disease.

In recent years, there has been a marked increase in the number of EHV-1 cases and several outbreaks of EHM at large horse events and facilities. The recent and increasing frequencies of EHM outbreaks support the designation of EHM as an "emerging disease".

Currently, there is not a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) licensed EHV-1 vaccine with a label claim for protection against the neurological strain of the EHV-1. However, there are numerous vaccines available for the protection against the respiratory component of EHV-1. Vaccination against EHV-1 may limit the amount of virus shed in nasal secretions and the dissemination of infection.

Prevention
----------
Implementation and enforcement of biosecurity measures on equine premises can help prevent the spread of EHV-1. Biosecurity measures that should be implemented and enforced include:
- Isolate any suspect, exposed or confirmed positive EHV-1/EHM horses.
- Restrict access of personnel to isolation area.
- Wear protective clothing including coveralls, rubber boots or plastic boot covers when entering the stall or when coming in contact with an EHV-1/EHM suspect, exposed or confirmed positive horse. All protective clothing should be disposed of or washed with hot water before contacting any other horses.
- Use disinfectant saturated foot mats or foot baths at entry or exit doors to barns and stalls. Be certain to change foot bath solutions frequently since the presence of organic matter may deactivate the disinfectant.
- Wear disposable gloves while handling infected animals. Thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water between contacts with horses.
- Always handle healthy animals first and sick animals last.
- Use separate grooming, feeding and handling equipment for each horse.

Disinfection
------------
Herpes viruses are susceptible to many disinfectants. A 1:10 dilution of bleach in water is effective against EHV-1. Both alcohol and bleach disinfectants are inactivated by organic matter, such as manure and soil. Therefore, all areas must be thoroughly cleaned of organic matter prior to the use of these products. Use soaps or detergents to decrease the organic matter present before applying a disinfectant.

In barn environments, where organic material cannot be completely eliminated, it is advisable to use a disinfectant retaining activity in the presence of organic matter. Phenolics, such as 1 Stroke Environ (R) or SynPhenol-3 (R), and accelerated hydrogen peroxide products, such as Intervention (R), have this property. Be sure to follow the manufacturers' recommendations and the label instructions for all disinfectants."

California believes the neurological form of EHV should be designated as an emerging disease. Their website (above) provides a table showing the numbers by year in California. While I have not looked up the ProMED-mail statistics it certainly feels like these cases are increasing. It seems time we had a vaccine for this disease. - Mod.TG
