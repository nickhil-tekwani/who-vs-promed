Beijing on [Mon 9 Aug 2021] reported an anthrax pneumonia patient, who comes from Chengde in North China's Hebei Province and had contact history with cattle and sheep, and products that come from those animals. The patient was transported to Beijing via an ambulance 4 days after showing symptoms, and was later quarantined and put under treatment, the Beijing Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Beijing CDC) announced on [Mon 9 Aug 2021].

Anthrax is highly deadly if not treated properly. _Bacillus anthracis_, the pathogen that causes anthrax, was developed into a biochemical weapon and had been used in 20th century. According to an article published in Science Focus, a journal from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Japan used it as a biochemical weapon in World War II.

Anthrax is prevalent among cattle and sheep. Human beings usually get infected after coming in contact with sick animals or contaminated products. The commonest route of infection, accounting for 95% of reported cases, is skin contact, which can cause blisters and skin necrosis, Beijing CDC said. The most dangerous type is anthrax pneumonia, when a patient inhales dust containing _B. anthracis_ and gets infected. People can get intestinal anthrax after eating contaminated food, usually meat, and will develop symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.

Anthrax can be transmitted directly between human beings but it's not [contagious, nor] as infectious as flu or COVID-19. _B. anthracis_ is a bacterium and multiple antibiotics are effective treatments.

[Historically pneumonic anthrax is seen as a result of exposure to spores shed from contaminated wool or hair, and in an occupational setting such as a mill. It is not seen in a rural setting, where the exposure follows from butchering a sick and dead animal, usually a bovine, sometimes sheep and goats, when it results in a cutaneous lesion. Wet spore clumps are too big to be inhaled. If this patient worked in a laboratory that initiates a very different possible source and possible circumstances, for example, a culture vial breaking in a centrifuge. And frankly, anthrax is not a contagious disease, just infectious.

Hebei Province is in north east China. For a description and map of the province, go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebei. In past decades livestock anthrax was common in this region, but lately, it is largely unobserved and maybe just very sporadic, like the previous outbreak in 2020: see below, 2020 Anthrax - China (02): (HB) human, source uncertain, susp 20201003.7831748. A bovine outbreak was reported to OIE in 2008 involving 3 cases, and ovine and caprine outbreaks were reported in 2005 (1 outbreak, 1 case) and in 2008 (1 outbreak, 3 cases). - Mod.MHJ
