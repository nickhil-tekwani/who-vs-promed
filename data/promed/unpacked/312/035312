Last week, 2 animals died in the Goiania zoological park. The body of
a 3-year-old deer was taken to the veterinary hospital of the
Universidade Federal de Goias for examination to discover the cause of
death. This past Thursday (22 [Jul 2010]), another large mammal, a
5-year-old mouflon [link to photo below] was found dead from a
pneumonia infection. Since 2009, 120 deaths have been recorded in the
park. The veterinarians of the zoo discarded the possibility of a
epidemic.

The Goias Public Ministry presented a request for the removal of the
Director of the park, which is closed for renovations.

[Other than the dead mouflon with pneumonia, there is essentially no
information on details of the occurrence of deaths in the zoo. Neither
the species with age and sex of the dead animals, total numbers of
animals by species in the zoo, dates of the deaths, signs, symptoms,
and pathologies observed nor results of laboratory tests are given,
making impossible diagnoses or even reasonable speculation about the
etiologies of the deaths. ProMED-mail would be interested in receiving
additional information about the deaths.

Goiania in Goias state can be accessed at
