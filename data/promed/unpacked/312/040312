1st bird flu case in season confirmed in Shimane Pref.
------------------------------------------------------
Avian influenza infection has been confirmed in a dead tundra swan
collected in Matsue, Shimane Prefecture, the 1st such confirmation in
the country this season, the Shimane prefectural government said
Thursday [10 Nov 2011].

The local government is examining whether the virus is a highly
virulent type. Results of the examination are expected in a week.

The infection was confirmed in a genetic test conducted at the
National Institute for Environmental Studies on the carcass found last
Monday [7 Nov 2011] in the Mihonoseki district of the western city,
located on the Sea of Japan, according to the local government.

[H5N1 epizootic was reported from Japan last year (2010), affecting
wildlife and domestic poultry. According to Japan's reports to the
OIE, the disease started in domestic fowl on 27 Nov 2010, spreading
and caused 25 outbreaks until declared resolved on 21 Mar 2011. A map
showing all outbreaks is available on-line at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=9999.

The epizootic in wild birds reportedly started on 16 Dec 2010, when a
wild mute swan (_Cygnus olor_) was found infected in Toyama
prefecture. The National Institute of Animal Health discovered that
the infection was caused by the same virus strain which had been
detected in faeces of migratory wild ducks in Hokkaido in October
2010, and in commercial layers in Shimane prefecture in November 2010.
A total of 46 outbreaks were reported, the extensive and widely spread
wildlife epizootic declared as resolved on 25 Mar 2011. A map showing
all outbreaks is available on-line at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=10072.


Notably, a rather similar event was reported from South Korea, where
an epizootic of HPAI H5N1, affecting both wild and domestic birds,
started on 29 Nov 2010 and was declared as resolved in May 2011. A map
showing all outbreaks in domestic and wild birds is available on-line
at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=10029.
It was suggested that wild birds could have played a noteworthy role
in both countries and may have been the link between them, a subject
which deserves further study -- including the data which may be
collected during the current season.

Final results of the laboratory tests regarding the currently
suspected tundra swan are anticipated with interest. The location of
Matsue can be seen at http://healthmap.org/r/1qDF. - Mod.AS]
