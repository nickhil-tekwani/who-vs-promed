In Viet Nam, a Gateway for Bird Flu; Ignoring Chicken Import Ban,
Smugglers Bring Virus Over Border From China
-----------------------------------------------
The smugglers 1st appeared on the distant ridgeline and then, like
ants, streamed down a dirt track carved from the lush, sculpted
mountains that separate Viet Nam from China. As the figures grew
closer, their stooped posture became visible, backs heaving under
bamboo cages crammed with live chickens. On the road below, 2 young
men identified by local officials as lookouts buzzed past on red dirt
bikes, slowing down to check out a reporter and his government
escorts who had stopped to watch. One man produced a 2-way radio and
started speaking urgently. Though his words were inaudible to the
visitors, within moments the figures on the hillside melted into the brush.
These traffickers haul more than 1000 contraband chickens a day into
Lang Son, one of 6 Vietnamese provinces along the Chinese border,
flouting a chicken import ban. In doing so, heath experts say, they
have also repeatedly smuggled the highly lethal bird flu virus from
its source in southern China into Viet Nam, where the disease has
taken a devastating toll on farm birds and killed at least 42 people
since 2003.
As bird flu continues to spread across the Eastern Hemisphere,
international health experts warn that illegal trade in poultry,
poultry products and other birds is often the primary cause. "Both
between and within countries, commerce is an incredibly important
factor," said Juan Lubroth, chief of infectious animal disease for
the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization. "We try to press with
governments that it has to be controlled or managed better. But like
trafficking in humans, weapons and drugs, with poultry it's not any easier."
Vietnamese veterinary officials disclosed in April [2006?] that they
had found bird flu in a sample taken from smuggled chickens
confiscated in Lang Son during a bust on the border. Days later,
officials in the remote, neighboring province of Cao Bang reported
the virus in poultry samples taken from 3 farms on the Chinese
border, after dozens of chickens had started dying, and smuggling was
suspected. These 2 episodes were the 1st official cases of bird flu
in Viet Nam since December 2005.
In May 2005, researchers had already found evidence that smuggling
was bringing in the bug: They isolated a strain of the H5N1 virus
that was new to Viet Nam but similar to one common in Guangxi, just
over the mountains from Lang Son. Lang Son's jagged border with China
runs for about 150 miles through angular, misty mountains with craggy
cliffs that seem drawn from a stylized painting. The highest peak,
which lends its name, Mau Son, to the local rice wine, rises nearly
4500 feet. For centuries, the extended families straddling this
border have navigated treacherous footpaths to run goods from one
side to the other, in recent years including electronics, DVDs,
exotic wildlife and all nature of clothes and shoes.
The bootleg poultry business turned lucrative 2 years ago, after Viet
Nam started slaughtering about 50 million chickens to contain its
bird flu epidemic. The resulting shortage of chicken meat, a prime
source of protein for the Vietnamese, sent prices soaring on their
side of the border.
Do Van Duoc, director of animal health in Lang Son, explained that
the huge difference in prices on opposite sides of the border makes
for a flourishing business, despite the ban on poultry imports from
China. Prices fluctuate, but on average, chicken that sells for 30
cents per pound or less in China can fetch a dollar or more in Viet
Nam. Duoc said the high cost of poultry in Viet Nam also reflects the
expense of importing vaccines and other medicine to combat bird flu.
Chinese farmers are able to keep costs down because of the vast scale
of their poultry industry and the inexpensive supply of feed and
domestically produced vaccines, he said.
China's Agriculture Ministry confirmed that poultry was being
illegally transported from Guangxi into Viet Nam. In response to
written questions, ministry officials said that an investigation by
Guangxi animal health investigators had discovered smuggling from 3
areas close to Lang Son province but that there were no reports of
this poultry being infected with bird flu. Chinese agriculture
officials said government veterinarians were working with customs and
border defense officers to stop the illicit trade. Chinese police
have confiscated more than 23 000 chickens and 3500 ducks this year
[2006], officials said.
An average of up to 1500 birds are slipped over the mountains into
Lang Son each day, Nguyen Thang Loi, director of market inspections
in Lang Son reported. Along the entire Viet Nam-China border, the
total could be thousands more, according to Vietnamese and
international livestock experts.
Worldwide, the trade in illegal poultry and other birds is extensive,
said Lubroth of the U.N. agriculture agency, though the specific
scope is unknown. This business includes large-scale commercial
shipments of un-inspected meat, often from China, to destinations as
diverse as Europe, Africa and the United States. Last month [June
2006], U.S. inspectors discovered 2000 pounds of frozen chicken, duck
and geese smuggled from China in a Detroit-area warehouse that
supplies Chinese restaurants and Asian groceries in southeastern Michigan.
Last year [2005], Taiwanese officials reported their 1st case of the
deadly bird flu virus among more than 1000 birds that were being
smuggled by ship from China. A pair of eagles confiscated 2 years ago
at Brussels International Airport from the hand luggage of a Thai
passenger were found to be carrying the disease.
