[For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods, please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2016, Chapter 2.9.2 "Camelpox" at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.09.02_CAMELPOX.pdf, from which the following commentary is quoted:

"Camelpox is a wide-spread infectious viral disease of Old World camelids. New World camelids are also susceptible. It occurs throughout the camel-breeding areas of Africa, north of the equator, the Middle East and Asia, and has an important economic impact through loss of production and sometimes death. Camelpox does not occur in the feral camel population of Australia. The camelpox virus belongs to the family Poxviridae, subfamily Chordopoxvirinae, genus Orthopoxvirus. The disease is characterised by fever, local or generalised pox lesions on the skin and in the mucous membranes of the mouth and respiratory tract. The clinical manifestations range from inapparent infection to mild, moderate and, less commonly, severe systemic infection and death. The disease occurs more frequently and more severely in young animals and pregnant females. Transmission is by either direct contact between infected and susceptible animals or indirect infection via a contaminated environment. The role of insects in transmission has been suspected because the disease is often observed after rainfall. Camelpox virus is very host specific and does not infect other animals. Zoonotic camelpox virus infection in humans associated with outbreaks in dromedary camels (_Camelus dromedarius_) was described in the north-eastern region of India during 2009. This was a single incident illustrating that camelpox is of limited public health importance." - Mod.CRD

Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, one single outbreak of camelpox has been reported, in southern Israel (Negev). According to Bali (ref 1), the outbreak started in January 1957, involving all age groups, severely affecting young stock (10-15 percent mortality). The mean duration of clinical disease was 3 weeks; surviving animals suffered a prolonged general loss of condition. The outbreak was resolved after 3 months.

The clinical signs observed during the said event included pox skin lesions on the head, progressing to the rest of the body, mainly visible on less haired areas such as the abdomen and armpits. In some cases, the entire head became swollen; eyes were affected in several animals, leading to blindness. Typical scars remained after recovery.

On 20 Jul 2016, Israel's Veterinary Services distributed circulars, in Hebrew and Arabic, to camel breeders and others engaged with camels (petting zoos, etc.). The circulars included Q&A addressing "Camel Contagious Ecthyma." It may be assumed that in the early stages of the current camel event, contagious ecthyma (orf) was suspected. Subscribers may note that while orf is characterized by the proliferative nature of the lesions, pox lesions are ulcerative. - Mod.AS
