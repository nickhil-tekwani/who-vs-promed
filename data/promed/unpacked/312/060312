The Venezuelan Medical Science Societies have reported 294 cases of
equine encephalitis, of which only 13 are in humans, of these cases 7
are Venezuelan equine encephalitis [VEE] and 6 are eastern equine
encephalitis [EEE].

They officially reported the upsurge of diseases, that were eradicated
years ago but recognizing that it is not a problem that has recently
appeared, and they say there are more cases of Venezuelan equine
encephalitis located in the state of Portuguesa, in the municipality
of Espino.

Former Minister Jose Felix Oletta stresses that equine encephalitis
and eastern equine encephalitis have been on the rebound in Venezuela,
using man as a host.

Oletta explains that there is an increase in diseases due to
circumstances such as climate change, rainfall, changes or mutations
of the virus, the rising waters, the low rate of vaccination of horses
and other circumstances. "In Venezuela we have found areas of very
high risk in some states, others intermediate [risk] and others a low
[risk]." In Zulia, Lara, Trujillo and Miranda there are disease foci.

He explained that in [epidemiological] week 14 an editorial brought
the equine encephalitis [cases]to his attention. "There was an
outbreak in horses in Bolivar state, this was indicated on 7 May
[2010] [but] we did not have confirmation [then], and we had
confirmation this Saturday [26 Jun 2010], with Alert 24, which reports
the existence of animal cases in the States of Bolivar, Aragua,
Guarico, Zulia and Portuguesa."

[Presumably, all the non-human cases are in equine animals (horses,
mules and donkeys). It is inaccurate to say that that EEE and VEE
viruses were eradicated in Venezuela. They are doubtless endemic there
but without causing disease in humans or equine animals, they go
undetected without monitoring mosquitoes and birds (for EEE virus) or
rodents (for VEE virus). If these equine cases are confirmed as VEE
virus infections, they are probably caused by VEE virus subtype IAB or
IC.

There is published evidence that 2 base pair mutations can change
enzootic VEE virus subtype ID into the epidemic IC subtype. It is
unfortunate that the equine animals were not vaccinated against this
virus. When outbreaks are infrequent, owners tend to neglect
vaccination [necessary to] maintain herd immunity. Over the past 80
years, there have been occasional massive equine outbreaks of VEE
virus in Venezuela. Case fatality can approach 80 percent in these
animals and survivors may have significant neurological sequelae.
There have been many human cases associated with these outbreaks.

ProMED awaits confirmation of the virus and subtype of the equine
cases and reports of any additional human cases with interest.
