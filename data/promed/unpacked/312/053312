A 6-year-old Indonesian girl tested positive for bird flu on Tuesday [22
Aug 2006], a government official said, as the World Health Organisation
ruled out human transmission in a village with a series of confirmed and
suspected bird flu cases [see: ProMED-mail post entitled "Avian influenza,
human (126): Indonesia 20060821.2351"].
The girl from Bekasi, an eastern suburb of Jakarta, is the 60th case of
avian influenza in Indonesia, 46 of which have been fatal. "The girl is
still alive and receiving treatment in hospital. She is getting better," I
Nyoman Kandun, Director General of Communicable Disease Control, told
reporters.
Indonesia has seen a steady rise in human bird flu deaths this year and the
virus is endemic in poultry in nearly all of the provinces of the sprawling
archipelago. Fears of a possible new cluster arose after a 35-year-old
woman from the West Javan village of Cikelet who died was confirmed to have
been infected by bird flu [virus]. Her 9-year-old daughter died a week
before after showing signs of bird flu, although no samples were taken for
testing. They are among 18 people in the area being investigated for
suspected bird flu.
"Though some of these undiagnosed deaths occurred in family members of
confirmed cases, the investigation has found no evidence of human-to-human
transmission and no evidence that the virus is spreading more easily from
birds to humans," the WHO said in a statement [see:
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2006_08_21/en/index.html>
or ProMED-mail post entitled "Avian influenza, human (126): Indonesia
20060821.2351"].
Kandun said the Health Ministry had distributed more than 13 000 tablets of
the anti-viral Tamiflu in the area. Indonesia, which has been criticised
for not doing enough to stamp out H5N1, has so far refused to [undertake]
mass culling of poultry, citing the expense and the logistical difficulties
because of millions of backyard fowl.
Bayu Krisnamurthi, head of the National Committee for Avian Influenza
Control and Pandemic Preparedness, said the government would launch a
national multimedia campaign starting on 1 Sep 2006 to spread awareness in
areas where the virus has been spreading. "Every village, district or
region that has had bird flu cases in poultry is at risk of becoming an
endemic area like Cikelet," he said, adding that 25 million fowl had been
culled since 2004.
