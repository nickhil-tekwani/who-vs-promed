I was the physician who sent the RFI on the item listed as:
RFI 970702215556 on pneumococcal meningitis
I sent the request based on a patient that had presented obtunded to the
emergency department at Misawa AF Hospital in Misawa Japan (in Aomori
prefecture, northern Honshu island). Culture of CSF determined the
presence of pneumococcus.
A CT and MRI of the patient later showed that she had a meningocele in one
of her sinuses and several foci of chronic sinusitis. It is still unclear
as to whether the patient had erosive sinusitis leading to a meningocele,
or whether the meningocele was present. The patient had been complaining
of a headache for several weeks, with several presentations to the clinic,
before she became febrile and obtunded in her dormitory room.
After a course of IV antibiotics she recovered completely and, last I
heard, she had no apparent sequelae. ENT was considering repairing her
sinus with a plate, but I'm not sure if surgery was performed.
