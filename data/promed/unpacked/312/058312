More dead birds in Germany, suspected bird flu
----------------------------------------------
Authorities in Bavaria have confirmed that more wild birds have been found
dead in Germany due to the H5N1 bird flu virus. According to police in the
southern state, movement restrictions have been put in place around the
Speichersee lake where 2 out of 3 ducks found dead were confirmed to have
been carrying the deadly virus.
Press reports have stated that about 14 other birds have also been found
dead in the area, however, it is not known if they are infected with the virus.
It was the first time in 2007 that the H5N1 strain of bird flu has been
found among domestic birds in Germany. Scientists suggest that it could
have jumped the border from the neighbouring Czech Republic where there
were infected poultry.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall
[The last sentence is odd because the reporter had started by describing
findings in wild ducks. Plus there had been an earlier recovery from birds
near Rheims Island on the Baltic coast of Germany; see 20070716.2279. - Mod.MHJ
Also odd is that the title says "suspected", but the word "confirmed" is
used twice in the first paragraph. - Mod.SH]
