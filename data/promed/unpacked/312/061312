At least 3 residents struck down with gastroenteritis at a Melbourne
nursing home were infected with salmonellosis, despite denials of a
food poisoning outbreak. Tests confirmed traces of the potentially
lethal bug in 2 elderly residents at Broughton Hall nursing home and
hostel as the death toll rose to 5.
The Camberwell nursing home yesterday, 16 Apr 2007, claimed the
illness, which affected 21 residents, was not food poisoning, citing
only 1 confirmed case of salmonella in a patient detected on Fri 13
Apr 2007. But tests of fecal samples by the Department of Human
Service (DHS) today, 17 Apr 2007, confirmed another 2 cases of
salmonellosis, which is usually a food-borne bacterial infection. A
total of 5 residents have died since the outbreak began in early Apr
2007 and 3 remain in hospital.
DHS spokesman Bram Alexander confirmed the salmonella cases but said
the bacteria had not been identified in tests of food samples taken
from the home's kitchen. "Salmonella bacteria has been identified in
an additional 2 samples taken from residents who fell ill at
Broughton Hall," he told AAP. "But tests are still under way on a 2nd
batch of food and obviously our investigation into the source of the
salmonella is continuing.''
Mr. Alexander could not say if food poisoning was the likely cause of
the salmonella outbreak. But Melbourne University Professor of
Microbiology Richard Strugnell said it was highly unlikely to have
been spread from human contact. "Salmonella gastroenteritis is, not
exclusively, but in the very high proportion of cases, the result of
eating contaminated food," he said. "If there's 2, 3 or 4 people that
were in the same institution and they all came down with the
infection over a short period my first reaction would be: Well have
they eaten the same food?"
The kitchen at Broughton Hall remains closed while the source of the
outbreak is investigated.

[Salmonellosis is generally a non-fatal enteric infection but the
very young, very old and those who are immunocompromised are at
substantial risk for a lethal outcome.
The statement that the salmonellosis was related to gastroenteritis
and not food-borne is apples and oranges. Gastroenteritis is, of
course, a symptom complex that does not imply food-borne or not. The
serotype of salmonellosis is not stated.
