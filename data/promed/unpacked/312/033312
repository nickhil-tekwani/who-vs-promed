New Zealand ordered a 3-day nationwide lockdown after detecting its 1st local COVID-19 case since February [2021], amid fears of the more transmissible delta (B1617.2) variant.

New Zealand's local case involves a 58-year-old Auckland man who hadn't yet been vaccinated and had no known links to the country's borders, according to the New Zealand Herald (https://bit.ly/3geiue0). His symptoms began yesterday [16 Aug 2021], and he tested positive today [17 Aug 2021].

Officials have identified 23 possible events where he could have passed the virus to others. Today [17 Aug 2021] officials confirmed 4 more cases, all linked to the man. One involves a hospital staff member, and tests confirmed that the virus is the delta variant.

New Zealand has won praise keeping its COVID-19 levels low with tough containment measures. Other countries that have kept cases low, including Viet Nam and Australia, have also struggled to contain the more transmissible delta variant.

More global headlines
---------------------
- Speaking at a United Nations briefing today [17 Aug 2021], WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic said the agency is worried about the spread of the virus in Afghanistan, given that upheaval related to the US military pullout and Taliban takeover has slowed vaccination, according to Reuters. Jasarevic said WHO mobile teams are waiting in Kabul because of the deteriorating situation and that chaos at the airport as people clamor to leave is slowing medical supply deliveries and exacerbating shortages (https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/who-concerned-about-covid-19-afghanistan-jabs-slow-2021-08-17/).
- In Thailand, police clashed with protestors who marched on the prime minister's office to register their anger about the country's handling of its COVID-19 surge, according to Reuters. The country has been reporting record high cases and a rocky vaccine rollout. Opposition politicians also filed a no-confidence motion, which will trigger a debate over the prime minister's pandemic actions (https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/clashes-thailand-pressure-builds-pm-over-coronavirus-crisis-2021-08-16/).
- The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) today [17 Aug 2021] announced a funding agreement with California-based Gritstone Bio to further the development of its next-generation COVID-19 vaccine, which will target variants. CEPI said the company's vaccine is based on a self-amplifying mRNA platform and that it will provide Gritstone up to USD 20.6 million to get the product through a phase 1 clinical trial. The award is CEPI's 5th to support next-generation COVID-19 vaccines (https://cepi.net/news_cepi/cepi-enters-into-funding-agreement-with-gritstone-bio-to-develop-covid-19-variant-vaccine/).
- The global total today [17 Aug 2021] topped 208 million, reaching 208 233 834 cases, along with 4 337 926 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins online dashboard (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html).

[2] Israel: booster vaccination
Date: Mon 16 Aug 2021 18:55 EDT
Source: Science [abridged, edited]
https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/08/grim-warning-israel-vaccination-blunts-does-not-defeat-delta


"Now is a critical time," Israeli Minister of Health Nitzan Horowitz said as the 56-year-old got a COVID-19 booster shot on 13 Aug 2021, the day his country became the 1st nation to offer a 3rd dose of vaccine to people as young as age 50. "We're in a race against the pandemic."

His message was meant for his fellow Israelis, but it is a warning to the world. Israel has among the world's highest levels of vaccination for COVID-19, with 78% of those 12 and older fully vaccinated, the vast majority with the Pfizer vaccine. Yet the country is now logging one of the world's highest infection rates, with nearly 650 new cases daily per million people. More than half are in fully vaccinated people, underscoring the extraordinary transmissibility of the delta variant and stoking concerns that the benefits of vaccination ebb over time.

The sheer number of vaccinated Israelis means some breakthrough infections were inevitable, and the unvaccinated are still far more likely to end up in the hospital or die. But Israel's experience is forcing the booster issue onto the radar for other nations, suggesting as it does that even the best vaccinated countries will face a delta surge.

"This is a very clear warning sign for the rest of world," says Ran Balicer, chief innovation officer at Clalit Health Services (CHS), Israel's largest health maintenance organization (HMO). "If it can happen here, it can probably happen everywhere."

Israel is being closely watched now because it was one of the 1st countries out of the gate with vaccinations in December 2020 and quickly achieved a degree of population coverage that was the envy of other nations -- for a time. The nation of 9.3 million also has a robust public health infrastructure and a population wholly enrolled in HMOs that track them closely, allowing it to produce high-quality, real-world data on how well vaccines are working.

Now, the effects of waning immunity may be beginning to show in Israelis vaccinated in early winter; a preprint published last month [July 2021] by physician Tal Patalon and colleagues at KSM, the research arm of Maccabi Healthcare Services (MHS), found that protection from COVID-19 infection during June and July dropped in proportion to the length of time since an individual was vaccinated (1). People vaccinated in January [2021] had a 2.26 times greater risk for a breakthrough infection than those vaccinated in April. (Potential confounders include the fact that the very oldest Israelis, with the weakest immune systems, were vaccinated first.)

At the same time, cases in the country, which were scarcely registering at the start of summer [2021], have been doubling every week to 10 days since then, with the delta variant responsible for most of them. They have now soared to their highest level since mid-February [2021], with hospitalizations and intensive care unit admissions beginning to follow. How much of the current surge is due to waning immunity versus the power of the delta variant to spread like wildfire is uncertain.

What is clear is that "breakthrough" cases are not the rare events the term implies. As of 15 Aug 2021, 514 Israelis were hospitalized with severe or critical COVID-19, a 31% increase from just 4 days earlier. Of the 514, 59% were fully vaccinated. Of the vaccinated, 87% were 60 or older. "There are so many breakthrough infections that they dominate and most of the hospitalized patients are actually vaccinated," says Uri Shalit, a bioinformatician at the Israel Institute of Technology (Technion) who has consulted on COVID-19 for the government. "One of the big stories from Israel [is]: 'Vaccines work, but not well enough.'"

To try to tame the surge, Israel has turned to booster shots, starting on 30 Jul 2021 with people 60 and older and, last Friday [13 Aug 2021], expanding to people 50 and older. As of Monday [16 Aug 2021], nearly one million Israelis had received a 3rd dose, according to the Ministry of Health. Global health leaders including Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, have pleaded with developed countries not to administer boosters given that most of the world's population hasn't received even a single dose. The wealthy nations pondering or already administering booster vaccines so far mostly reserve them for special populations such as the immune compromised and healthcare workers.

Still, studies suggest boosters might have broader value. Researchers have shown that boosting induces a prompt surge in antibodies, which are needed in the nose and throat as a crucial 1st line of defense against infection. The Israeli government's decision to start boosting those 50 and older was driven by preliminary Ministry of Health data indicating people over age 60 who have received a 3rd dose were half as likely as their twice-vaccinated peers to be hospitalized in recent days, Mevorach says. CHS also reported that out of a sample of more than 4500 patients who received boosters, 88% said any side effects from the 3rd shot were no worse, and sometimes milder, than from the 2nd.

Yet boosters are unlikely to tame a delta surge on their own, says Dvir Aran, a biomedical data scientist at Technion. In Israel, the current surge is so steep that "even if you get two-thirds of those 60-plus [boosted], it's just gonna give us another week, maybe 2 weeks until our hospitals are flooded." He says it's also critical to vaccinate those who still haven't received their 1st or 2nd doses, and to return to the masking and social distancing Israel thought it had left behind -- but has begun to reinstate.

Aran's message for the United States and other wealthier nations considering boosters is stark: "Do not think that the boosters are the solution."

[This is a dire warning from Israel and should be taken very seriously with movement forward by the USA to start booster inoculations. Also recommended reading, "NIH director says new Israeli COVID data is building case for booster shots in the US" (https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/17/covid-vaccine-booster-shots-nih-director-says-new-israel-data-is-building-case-in-the-us.html): "The [Israeli] data reportedly showed that for people vaccinated in January [2021] who are age 65 and older, the Pfizer vaccine was less than 55% effective against severe disease and hospitalization. Collins said Tuesday [17 Aug 2021] that federal officials are starting to see the same thing in US data." - Mod.LK]

[3] USA: hospitalizations
Date: Sun 15 Aug 2021

A lagging vaccination campaign and the spread of the highly contagious delta variant are driving a surge in COVID-19 hospitalizations in the United States. Among Americans under age 50, average daily hospital admissions have hit a pandemic high, according to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

"We're seeing a lot of people get seriously ill," Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the Biden administration's lead adviser on the pandemic, said on the CBS program "Face the Nation" on Sunday [15 Aug 2021]. "The hospitalizations are on the brink of actually overrunning the hospitals, particularly intensive care units."

The trend is particularly notable among children and younger adults. From 5-11 Aug 2021, 263 children were admitted to hospitals every day, on average, compared with 217 in early January [2021], the last peak. Average daily admissions also rose to a record among 18- to 49-year-olds, according to the CDC. Gov. Kate Brown of Oregon has called in at least 500 National Guard troops to help hospitals cope with a flood of coronavirus patients as the state faces its largest wave of infections in the pandemic.

The delta variant now accounts for more than 83% of new infections in the United States. Roughly 129 000 new cases are reported each day, a 65% increase from 2 weeks ago, according to a database maintained by The New York Times.

"This is going very steeply upward with no signs of having peaked out," Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said on "Fox News Sunday." "So I will be surprised if we don't cross 200 000 cases a day in the next couple of weeks."

Hospitalizations are increasing in every age group. From 5-11 Aug 2021, the average number of daily hospital admissions was roughly 20% to 30% higher, for all age groups, than during the previous week.

But among adults ages 50 and older, who are at highest risk for severe disease but the most likely to be vaccinated, new hospital admissions remain below previous pandemic peaks. Among Americans who are 70 or older, hospital admissions are 65% lower than they were in early January [2021], according to the CDC.

The vaccines remain effective against the delta variant and provide powerful protection against severe disease and death. Half of Americans have been fully vaccinated, but rates vary significantly by location and age.

Just 47% of 12-17-year-olds have gotten at least one shot, compared with 67% of 18-64-year-olds and 91% of people who are 65 or older. Children under 12 are not yet eligible for the vaccines.

Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the 2nd-highest-ranking Republican in the House, said on Sunday that "hospitals having overloaded capacity are the biggest concern" in his state. Louisiana has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country, with less than half of all adults fully vaccinated.

"I have high confidence in this vaccination," Mr. Scalise said. "It's safe and effective, and I think we ought to be encouraging more people to do it, but again, not shaming people who haven't." Mr. Scalise received his 1st dose of the Pfizer vaccine less than a month ago and had previously blamed President Biden for vaccine hesitancy among Americans.

It is not yet clear whether delta causes more severe disease than other variants. Several studies -- in Canada, Scotland and Singapore -- have suggested that it might, though the research is preliminary. Some doctors on the front lines have reported that the variant seems to be making young adults "sicker, quicker."

But the variant is driving a surge in new infections, especially in areas and among populations in which vaccination rates are low. More than 95% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients are unvaccinated, health officials have said.

"All of this is entirely predictable and yet, on the other hand, entirely preventable," Dr. Fauci said. "We've got to get people vaccinated. We have about 90 million people who are eligible to be vaccinated who are not vaccinated, and that's very highly concentrated in the Southern states."

Increasing vaccination rates among those who are eligible can help protect young children who do not yet qualify for the shots, Dr. Collins said. Both Dr. Fauci and Dr. Collins also said that while face masks had become controversial, they were a key public health tool that could help slow the spread of the virus.

"This mask that I'm holding has somehow become a symbol that it never should have been," Dr. Collins said. "This is basically just a lifesaving medical device, and somehow it's now being seen as an invasion of your personal liberty."

[Further from The New York Times: "Making matters worse, many hospitals are also reporting a highly unusual spike in children with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a contagious flulike illness that typically strikes in the fall and winter. RSV cases were abnormally low last winter, likely because of lockdowns and pandemic precautions, but cases have been rising as officials lift restrictions and children begin to mingle.

"Children's Mercy Kansas City had nearly 3 times as many RSV patients as COVID patients late last week, while Texas Children's had nearly 1500 positive RSV tests in the last 90 days, hospital officials said.

"'That has created a dual surge,' Dr. Versalovic said. 'Because both viruses are widely circulating, we're seeing a much greater impact.'

"The combination of RSV and COVID has pushed Children's Hospital New Orleans to capacity. 'We haven't had an empty bed in any of our intensive care units in 6 weeks,' Dr. Kline said" (https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/09/health/coronavirus-children-delta.html). - Mod.LK]
