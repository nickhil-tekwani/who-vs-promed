[During the week of 4 Feb 2007], 2 cows died of anthrax: one in the
Prince Albert area and the other in the Rose Valley-Archerwill District.
Last summer [2006], about 800 head of livestock died in northeast and
north-central Saskatchewan. It was the province's worst recorded
anthrax outbreak in history. Those deaths occurred after anthrax
spores in the soil were ingested during grazing.
The new cases occurred when the 2 cattle ate feed containing spores.
Dr. Sandra Stephens is a veterinarian with the Canadian Food
Inspection Agency. (CFIA). She says the spores could have gotten into
the feed in a number of ways. Mud could have stuck to the bales in
the field, the soil could have been incorporated in the feed during
baling, or standing water could have transferred the spores from the
infected soil. Anthrax spores can remain in the soil for years and
more cases are expected this summer. Winter anthrax cases are
unusual, but Stephens says there was a single case in 2004.
Both herds were vaccinated for anthrax last summer [2006]. However,
Dr. Stephens says some cows may not produce enough antibodies. It is
also possible that the vaccination for the affected animals may have
been missed or not properly given. The vaccine manufacturer says
their product is effective for a period of 6-12 months.
Dr. Stephens says producers should watch their animals and report any
sudden deaths.

[It is not unusual for hay to get contaminated especially if it rains
during haymaking and the contaminated soil gets up into the drying
hay. About 10 years ago there was a similar winter outbreak in
Oklahoma [USA] and the disease broke out in the herd buying the hay,
which frankly was rather grubby. Why these cows were not protected if
vaccinated in 2006 is hard to say but cold weather will reduce the
innate resistance of an animal and the ability to mobilise immunity.
Although winter cases can occur in grazing animals -- there was a
recent case involving a North Dakota [USA] horse -- feed should come
under immediate suspicion when investigating winter cases of anthrax.
Further details have been requested of Dr. Stephens. - Mod.MHJ]

The hay is not from a common source, i.e. not the same field of hay.
However, this entire area of the province was extremely wet -- so
many hay fields had similar flooded conditions. The farm south of
Prince Albert (RM 461) was a positive premises from last summer
[2006]. The farm south and east of Melfort (RM 397) did not report
any cases last summer. Both herds had been vaccinated once last summer.
One herd had some new additions to the herd -- vaccination status
unknown. One herd owner acknowledged that a few animals were known to
have been missed during vaccination. The owner thought the animal
that died had been vaccinated.
Both these herds have been vaccinated again.
