Tasmanian devil may become endangered species because of cancer. The
population falls sharply as scientists search for a cure.
-----------------------------------------------
It could be the end of an icon. Over the past decade, a form of
cancer has killed almost 3 out of 4 Tasmanian devils, the world's
largest marsupial carnivore and inspiration for the cartoon character Taz.
Animals with the disease develop tumors on their heads and in their
mouths, making it difficult for them to eat. Most animals die within
months of the lesions appearing, often from starvation.
The condition, Devil Facial Tumor Disease, was 1st noticed by a
photographer in 1996. Since then, the estimated population of the
animals, which are found in the wild only in the Australian island
state of Tasmania, has dropped from 200 000 to between 50 000 and 60
000, according to researchers say. 2/3rds of the remaining Tasmanian
devils are thought to be affected, and scientists wonder whether they
will be able to find a cure in time to save the rest. The process is
now in the works to have it listed as an endangered species," said
Hamish McCallum, chief scientist of the Devil Facial Tumor Program,
which is financed by the government.
McCallum's researchers say they suspect that the disease is spread
when cancer cells are passed between animals, usually by biting. "The
best hypothesis is that it is transmitted as part of biting, and most
of the biting happens at the time of mating," he said. But beyond
this, little is known about the cancer. No other species has shown
signs of it. "It might have been pure chance or bad luck, or a devil
might have come across a powerful carcinogen or mutagen in a dump,
but no one knows," McCallum said. And there is no test to detect the
disease in pre-tumorous animals. Tasmanian devils have a reputation
for bad temper. But Rodrigo Hamede, a specialist on the cancer who
traps and monitors the animals, says it is not deserved.
They are reputed to have gotten their name from their black color and
the diabolical noise they make. In Hamede's hands, the devils are
placid. To check their mouths for tumors, he gently blows on their
snouts, triggering their threat response, which is to open their
mouths and bare their fangs. As he tenderly handled a female devil
with a huge tumor covering most of her head, he said, "I'd hoped I
wouldn't see her again." Hamede caught her 3 months earlier as part
his monitoring effort, and she had been badly diseased then. He said
he had hoped that nature would have put her out of her suffering by
now. He releases the animals back into the wild with a microchip,
regardless of how ill they are. "If the devils are ever going to
develop immunity -- and to my mind that is the best bet -- by
removing creatures you are making it less likely," Hamede said. The
trapping program has taught McCallum's team how quickly the disease
can work. "The chance of any animal caught as an adult surviving to
the next year is close to zero," he said.
Those running the Devil Facial Tumor Program say they are hoping that
unaffected populations will remain in remote and isolated pockets of
the island, but they are taking no chances. They are running a pilot
program on an isolated peninsula where all the diseased devils they
capture are killed. There is some evidence that this approach is
working to protect the overall population because, over time, the
average age of the animals they capture has become older, suggesting
that more animals are avoiding the cancer and surviving longer. But
the program is expensive, and McCallum said his team was not yet sure
about its effectiveness in stopping the disease.
They are also considering establishing a new colony of wild animals
on an island off the Tasmanian coast but say the potential for
destabilizing that island's ecology by introducing a large predator
needs further study. As an interim emergency measure, they have sent
47 disease-free devils to wildlife parks on the Australian mainland,
creating what they call an insurance population to guarantee that the
species does not die out completely. McCallum calls it an imperfect
solution. "If all you end up with is a bunch of captive populations,
you've failed," he said. More animals are going to be sent out of
Tasmania, but as the disease spreads it is harder to find healthy animals.
Because there is no way to identify animals carrying the disease
before the tumors appear, devils intended for transfer have to be
taken from areas that researchers are certain are outside the cancer
zone. "This is our last sure year to take specimens out of the wild,"
says Nick Mooney, a conservationist with the Department of Primary
Industry and Water, an arm of the Tasmanian government that oversees
the devil program. Mooney does not underestimate the size of the
challenge facing the devils. "Islands have a miserable history of
extinctions, especially if you are a large predator," he said.
In its recent history, Australia has seen more mammal extinctions
than any other land mass, mostly because indigenous species were
squeezed out by nonnative animals introduced by settlers. Mooney says
that even if the devil can ultimately be saved, Tasmania's ecology
has already been severely disrupted. The decline of the island's most
important predator could lead to a population explosion among prey
species like rats and small kangaroos, or it could leave a vacancy
for an immigrant species. He is particularly worried that without the
devils, foxes -- which are present in small numbers -- could become
more established in Tasmania, and feral cats, which are already
killing rare indigenous wildlife, could multiply. That, in turn,
would make recovery of the devil population far less likely.

If indeed this cancer is being passed between animals, then perhaps
it is a cancer caused by a virus, like human cervical cancer, or
other cancers that have been identified as associated or caused by a
virus. Hopefully, they will find a cure for this disease before the
world looses this fascinating creature. - Mod.TG]
