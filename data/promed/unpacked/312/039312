A one-year-old boy has been treated for 3 days on suspicion of bird
flu infection at Zainoel Abidin General Hospital (RSUZA), Banda Aceh.

Chairman of the doctors in RSUZA bird flu Dr. Maimunah said the child
was admitted to hospital on Sunday [17 Jul 2011], after referral from
the RSU Sigli. The child's initial symptom was high fever. "His fever
had reached 39 C," said Dr. Maimunah, answering reporters yesterday
[19 Jul 2011].

Dr. Maimunah said to determine whether the child had been exposed to
bird flu [avian influenza A/H5N1 virus infection] or not, samples
(nasal and throat swabs) had been sent for laboratory diagnosis in
Jakarta, but the result was not yet available (as of 19 Jul 2011).

Dr. Maimunah said the child was a bird flu suspect, because in
addition to suffering from high fever, according to both the victim's
parents, before their son's fever, a number of their chickens and
other chickens in Ulim tetanganya had died suddenly. On the basis of
test results [carried out] by the Department of Animal Health, the
cause of death of the chickens was bird flu virus [avian A/H5N1 virus
infection].

Dr. Maimunah urged other communities, if they have the same thing
like chickens dying suddenly and then there is someone with a fever,
to immediately [consult a doctor]. "Chickens that die suddenly should
also be examined by the Department of Animal Health," pleaded Dr.
Maimunah.

Dr. Fachrurrazi, a microbiology expert at the College of Veterinary
Medicine, Unsyiah, explained that the process of transmission of avian
influenza virus from poultry to humans may not necessarily happen
directly; it [could] be through the intermediary of swine. "The H5N1
virus from infected chickens [might be transmitted] to pigs and then
passed back to chickens. This is where mutation could occur prior to
subsequent transmission from chicken to human. Without pigs as
intermediaries, there would be no problem with humans," he explained.
This is also a reason why a virus attack is often [reported] in Medan,
North Sumatra, which is culturally very different from Aceh, which
forbids [consumption of] pork. "Therefore, if there is ever a positive
patient in Aceh, [it would be well worth exploring the possibility of
whether the bird flu virus had ever been transmitted to pigs], because
that's where the possibility of human attacks may exist."

The evidence for avian A/H5N1 virus infection of the child is high
fever of the patient and the deaths of chickens in the patient's home
and surroundings. As yet, the there is no laboratory confirmation that
the patient's illness is bird flu.

The suggestion that the virulence of the avian virus for humans may
have been a consequence of an increase in virulence of the virus for
humans as a result of transmission of the virus from bird to pig and
back to bird is an interesting proposal, but based apparently on
religious conviction rather than experimental evidence.

Aceh is a province of Indonesia located on the northern tip of the
island of Sumatra. Aceh province has the highest proportion of Muslims
in the country. It is a religiously conservative area. Banda Aceh is
the provincial capital and largest city in the province of Aceh. A map
