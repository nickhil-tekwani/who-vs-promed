An outbreak of cholera has spread from a rural valley in central
Haiti to the nation's capital, intensifying worries the disease will
spread in squalid tarp camps that house hundreds of thousands of
earthquake survivors. The death toll from the epidemic topped 200
Saturday [23 Oct 2010], and fears of it propagating in the crowded,
earthquake-ravaged Port-au-Prince increased after 5 cases were
detected in the city.

UN officials stressed that the 5 cases, the 1st confirmed in the
capital since the epidemic started, were people who had become
infected in the main outbreak zone of Artibonite, north of
Port-au-Prince, and had subsequently traveled to the city, where they
fell sick.

"They were very quickly diagnosed and isolated," UN humanitarian
spokeswoman Imogen Wall told Reuters, citing information from Haitian
health authorities. "This is not a new location of infection." But
prevention measures and surveillance were being increased in
Port-au-Prince, with its squalid sprawling slums and about 1.3
million survivors of the 12 Jan 2010 earthquake packed into tent and
tarpaulin camps. All are highly vulnerable to a virulent diarrhea
disease like cholera.

Health officials are fearful about the outbreak spreading into the
capital, where thousands upon thousands of people are living in
unsanitary conditions in refugee camps.

"It will be very, very dangerous," said Claude Surena, president of
the Haitian Medical Association. "Port-au-Prince already has more
than 2.4 million people, and the way they are living is dangerous
enough already."

With more than 2600 cholera cases reported and experts predicting the
numbers will rise, Haitian and international medical teams are
working desperately to isolate and contain the epidemic in the
Artibonite and Central Plateau regions, north of the rubble-strewn
capital.

Haitian health officials told a news conference Sat 23 Oct 2010 that
194 people had died from cholera in the Artibonite region, the main
outbreak zone, with 14 other deaths in neighboring Central Plateau,
where a prison was among the places affected. The total number of
cases had reached 2674.

Cholera was confirmed on Fri 22 Oct 2010 during the morning by the
Haitian health minister, Alex Larsen, who said that this is cholera
type O1, which is the most dangerous and the source of most outbreaks
of cholera in the world, according to the World Health Organization
(WHO).

[No transmission has been documented in Port-au-Prince, based on the
observation that the 5 cases had traveled to the capital, not
acquired the infection there. Spread to the capital is likely to be
inevitable, and, given the conditions there, may be a devastating
blow to the earthquake-ravaged city. The organism is reported to be
O1. O1 and O139 are the only strains able to cause epidemic spread of
cholera. The other markers of identification, the strains' biotype
and phenotype, are pending. - Mod.LL]
