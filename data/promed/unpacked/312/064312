The tomato season has had a very difficult start because of the exorbitant amount of pests and viruses that producers are dealing with. Many tomato plantings are being uprooted because of the brown rugose virus.

Some capsicum and zucchini plantings are affected by aphids and also by bacteria, specifically by clavibacter. Growers are worried because of problems with plant hygiene in plantings.

[ToBRFV
------
_Tomato brown rugose fruit virus_ (ToBRFV) was recently identified as a new member of the genus _Tobamovirus_ (type member _Tobacco mosaic virus_, TMV) in Jordan and soon after in Israel (see links below). Since then, it has also been reported from a number of other countries in Europe and the Mediterranean region, as well as from North America and China. It was shown to affect also capsicum and has been detected in both plants and seeds of both crops. ToBRFV symptoms on tomato vary depending on host cultivar but may include chlorosis, mottling, mosaic, crinkling (rugosis) on leaves; necrotic spots on petioles and calyces; yellowish mottling, brown spots, rugosis on fruit to make them unmarketable. On capsicum, leaf symptoms are similar; fruits may be deformed with yellow mottling or green stripes. Almost 100% incidence was reported for some outbreaks in tomato, but not every fruit on an infected plant may show symptoms. The virus has been included in the A2 quarantine list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO).

ToBRFV (like many tobamoviruses) is seed transmitted and can also be spread by mechanical means, contaminated equipment, as well as with plant matter or other materials. It is very stable and can remain infectious for months outside a host. Recently, bumblebees, which are used widely as commercial pollinators in glasshouse tomato production, have been shown to be effective vectors of ToBRFV (see link below). Volunteer crop plants and solanaceous weed species are likely pathogen reservoirs. The Tm-22 resistance gene used in some tomato cultivars to protect from other tobamoviruses (such as _Tomato mosaic virus_) does not appear to be effective against ToBRFV. Disease management relies mainly on exclusion but may include phytosanitation (disinfecting tools, removing crop debris) and control of virus reservoirs. Use of certified clean seeds or crop transplants is crucial. Research on possible seed treatments to eliminate the virus is being carried out (see link below). Tomato seeds are traded widely and are known to pose a risk of spreading viruses and other pathogens internationally (for example, ProMED post 20140122.2222560).

Coinfection of ToBRFV with _Pepino mosaic virus_ (genus _Potexvirus_) and _Tomato spotted wilt virus_ (genus _Orthotospovirus_) have been found in tomato (ProMED posts 20191029.6751082, 20200507.7307615). It is thought that the respective symptoms may have been due to either virus or synergism. Further research is needed to clarify a potential role of ToBRFV in coinfections and to determine whether its presence in coinfections may have led to earlier cases of misdiagnosis and delayed identification of this new virus.

Bacterial canker
----------------
Species and subspecies in the genus _Clavibacter_ are known to affect a range of crops. Members cause, for example, bacterial canker of tomato (and capsicum) or potato ring rot, which can both lead to serious losses in the respective crops. (For more information see previous ProMED posts in the archives.) The bacteria are mostly spread by water and mechanical means; they can survive for a long time in plant debris and on equipment. Disease management relies mainly on the use of clean seed and plant hygiene measures (elimination of pathogen sources). Resistant germplasm is available for some of the crops.
