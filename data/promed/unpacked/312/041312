High disease levels in Ireland
------------------------------
[This is] to warn all to watch out for very worrying levels of
disease in Irish cereal crops.

In trials in Cork, even with a very robust spray programme, levels of
septoria are very high in winter wheat. [In barley, there are] also
quite noticeable amounts of net blotch and a spattering of
rhyncho[sporium] in Quench, which is recognised as a clean variety.

This may be the result of a very warm April [2011] followed by more
than 10 cm [4 in] of rain in the 1st week of May. A lot of showers
since then will also have been splashing the disease spores up through
the crop canopy. It looks like a year where disease control shortcuts
could cost dearly.

Other parts of the country did not receive this much rain so the
above may not be as much of an issue.

[Septoria
---------
Cereal diseases of the septoria complex are caused by the fungi
_Mycosphaerella graminicola_ and _Phaeosphaeria nodorum_. They affect
mainly wheat, but also barley, oat, occasionally rye, and some grass
species. Symptoms on wheat and barley are very similar and include
blotches on both leaves and glumes, which reduce the photosynthetic
ability of the host. Up to 50 percent yield losses have been reported
on susceptible varieties.

Spores can be spread by infected plant material, wind, water (rain
splash), and mechanical means. The pathogens can overwinter on crop
debris and on autumn sown crops or volunteer crop plants. Disease
management includes fungicide treatments aimed at preventing the
disease becoming established on the upper 3 leaves of the crop canopy,
removal of inoculum sources, and use of resistant varieties.

Net blotch
----------
Net blotch of barley is caused by the fungus _Pyrenophora teres_ and
affects only domestic and wild barleys (_Hordeum_ spp.). The disease
causes necrotic areas on leaves leading to yield losses of up to 20
percent. There are 2 types of the fungus, the net type caused by _P.
t._ f. _teres_, and the spot type caused by _P. t._ f. _maculata_. The
fungus survives between seasons on barley residue, volunteer barley
plants, some grasses, and seed. Disease management includes cultural
practices to remove pathogen reservoirs, fungicide applications, use
of clean seed, and use of resistant cultivars. Highly aggressive new
strains of the net form are emerging worldwide.

Scald
-----
Scald (or leaf blotch) caused by _Rhynchosporium secalis_ is one of
the most destructive diseases of barley, particularly in wet
conditions. It can decrease yield by up to 40 percent and reduces
grain quality. Symptoms include lesions on leaves and leaf sheaths
which later merge into large areas of dead tissue and may destroy the
whole green leaf area of the plant. The pathogen can also cause
symptomless seed infection which leads to a high risk of spread.

Scald is a polycyclic disease, with the primary inoculum produced on
crop debris and infected seeds. Secondary disease spread occurs
primarily by splashing rain. The fungus is highly variable and a
sexual stage is likely to exist. Management strategies include
cultural practices to reduce inoculum, fungicides, and use of clean
seed. No durable single major resistance genes for scald are known.
Field resistance appears to be substantially polygenic which makes
resistance breeding difficult, as illustrated above by the variety
Quench.
