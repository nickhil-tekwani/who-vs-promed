Anthrax infection among humans in the Saratov region: details
-------------------------
The Veterinary Department of the government of the Saratov region has established that an unauthorized slaughter of a bovine took place in the Balashovsky district of the Saratov region. On the 4 Jun 2015, 2 persons who participated in this slaughter were referred for medical aid to the health care facility with suspicion of anthrax.

At this time all necessary veterinary-sanitary measures are being carried out at the suspected focus of infection. Laboratory investigation of biological samples is under way. Meat was taken from owners and burned, and the ash was buried following all required veterinary and sanitary rules. All livestock that was in contact with the slaughtered animal were clinically checked and their temperatures taken. [Presumably no further bovine cases were found. - Mod.MHJ]

The next day [5 Jun 2015], 3 inhabitants of the village of Repnoye of the Balashevsky district of the Saratov region were hospitalized in the infectious diseases department of the hospital with suspicion of anthrax. A preliminary diagnosis of anthrax was established in 2 of them. The 3rd person was hospitalized with implementation of preventive measures including treatment. All necessary preventive measures are now carried out. [Complete? - Mod.MHJ]

A single case of ovine anthrax has been registered in the village of Okuny of the Chernyansky district of the Belgorod region. The animal died on 1 of the private agriculture farms in the village on 28 May 2015. After several days it was established that the sheep had died from anthrax.

It is possible that this animal contracted anthrax in the pasture. Perhaps an unauthorized unknown burial place contaminated with anthrax is located in this pasture. Samples of earth [from the pasture] have been taken and are now under investigation for the presence of anthrax spores.

Triple disinfection in the focus of infection [i.e., where the sheep was found dead. - Mod.MHJ] has been carried out in the village and adjacent territory. The carcass of the dead sheep was burned. All susceptible animals -- sheep, cattle and even pigs in the village -- have been vaccinated.

[Our heartfelt thanks to our ProMED-RUS colleague, Natalia, in Rostov-on-Don for bringing these reports to our notice and translating them.

Anthrax is sporadically reported in Russia and persists in spite of significant levels of reported annual vaccination. Probably because there is a disconnect between reported oblast actions and realities at the village level. - Mod.MHJ]
