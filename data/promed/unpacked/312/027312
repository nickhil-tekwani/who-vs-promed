Cholera Outbreak Hits Marshall Islands
-------------------------------------------
MAJURO: A cholera outbreak in the Marshall Islands has killed 4 people and
hospitalized at least 40 others, Health Secretary Donald Capelle said.
The government was preparing to implement emergency health regulations
banning all non-essential travel to and from Ebeye Island, the site of the
outbreak, in an effort to prevent the spread to nearby islands, Capelle
said Sunday night.
"We want to contain it on Ebeye," Capelle said. "If it gets into the outer
islands where there are no doctors and IVs (intravenous fluids), it would
be a real disaster."
Christmas celebrations in this staunchly Christian nation, a series of tiny
islands scattered across the Pacific Ocean east of the Philippines, will be
muted on Ebeye. Local churches have cooperated with health authorities by
calling off the customary food sharing in the hope this will slow the
spread of the disease.
Laboratory tests in Honolulu Saturday confirmed the fears of local
physicians that the numerous islanders who descended on Ebeye's hospital
with profuse vomiting and diarrhea had cholera. Capelle said there had as
yet been no confirmed spread of the contagious illness outside of Ebeye.
About 11 000 islanders live crowded on the crowded 32 hectare (80-acre)
island. While recent infrastructure developments have improved health
conditions, availability of fresh water is minimal and sanitation remains
problematic.
Ebeye is also home to about 1200 Marshall Islanders who work at the
Kwajalein missile testing range, where the US is field-testing components
of its proposed national missile defense program.
A cholera epidemic swept the island of Pohnpei in the Federated States of
Micronesia, about 1000 kilometres (600 miles) to the west of the Marshall
Islands, from last April. It was largely brought under control more than 2
months ago, and Pohnpei is now assisting the Marshall Islands by sending
4000 doses of cholera vaccine.
The Marshall Islands government's cabinet was expected to endorse an
emergency health decree on Christmas Day that would only allow travel out
of Ebeye by those carrying proof of vaccination against cholera.

[The Republic of the Marshall Islands has a population of approximately 61
000 living on 29 coral atolls and 5 small low-lying islands in the central
Pacific, mid-way between Hawaii and Australia. This is the first report of
cholera in the Marshall Islands carried by ProMED-mail. Readers are
referred to the PACNET outbreak and control information for cholera
(<http://www.spc.int/phs/>) for detailed information on the regional
guidelines for cholera outbreak control. If our friends at PACNET have
more information on this reported outbreak it would be very much
appreciated. - Mod.MPP
