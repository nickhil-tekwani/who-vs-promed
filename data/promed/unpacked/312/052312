According to a report in Voice of China's "News Criss-Cross," Ming Yang Battery Factory in Wuxi City of Jiangsu Province is a nickel cadmium battery producer. Recently, listeners told media that 70 employees of Ming Yang Battery Factory were found to have urine cadmium levels significantly above standards. Some workers had nearly 10 times over the standard.

But, upon applying to related agencies for appraisal of occupational disease, they were told that this does not constitute an occupational illness. [So where else would such levels of cadmium come from in these workers? Food, only if the source is contaminated and we have no reports of such an event. - Mod.TG]

This created difficulties for the protection of the workers' legal rights.

Everyone probably recalls from the "cadmium rice" event in Hunan that excessive cadmium causes harm to bones and kidneys, leading to painful illness and osteocarcinoma. So how can the 70 workers with excessive cadmium in urine protect their rights in this case?

[Discovered in the early 1800s, the use of cadmium and various cadmium salts started to become industrially important near the close of the 19th century, rapidly thereafter began to flourish, yet has diminished more recently.

Cadmium is an established human and animal carcinogen.

Most evidence is available for elevated risk for lung cancer after occupational exposure; however, associations between cadmium exposure and tumors at other locations including kidney, breast, and prostate may be relevant as well. Furthermore, enhanced cancer risk may not be restricted to comparatively high occupational exposure, but may also occur via environmental exposure, for example in areas in close proximity to zinc smelters.

In reference to the "cadmium rice" further study of that incidence involved zinc, lead, and arsenic, with some cadmium. Cadmium concentrations in agricultural soil and wheat have increased continuously during the last century. At present, soil cadmium concentrations increase by about 0.2 percent per year. Cadmium accumulates in the kidneys. Human kidney concentrations of cadmium have increased several fold during the last century.

A 2006 study involving cadmium and urine found that urine levels were an indicator of overall health and exposure. The study did not document bone cancer but rather bone weakening and osteoporosis (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1480481/). High cadmium exposure is known to cause bone damage, but the association between low-level cadmium exposure and osteoporosis remains to be clarified. Using a population-based women's health survey in southern Sweden [Women's Health in the Lund Area (WHILA)] with no known historical cadmium contamination, we investigated cadmium-related effects on bone in 820 women (53-64 years of age). We measured cadmium in blood and urine and lead in blood, an array of markers of bone metabolism, and forearm bone mineral density (BMD). Associations were evaluated in multiple linear regression analysis including information on the possible confounders or effect modifiers: weight, menopausal status, use of hormone replacement therapy, age at menarche, alcohol consumption, smoking history, and physical activity. Median urinary cadmium was 0.52 microgram/L adjusted to density (0.67 microgram/g creatinine). After multivariate adjustment, BMD, parathyroid hormone, and urinary deoxypyridinoline (U-DPD) were adversely associated with concentrations of urinary cadmium (p less than 0.05) in all subjects. These associations persisted in the group of never-smokers, which had the lowest cadmium exposure (mainly dietary). For U-DPD, there was a significant interaction between cadmium and menopause (p = 0.022). These results suggest negative effects of low-level cadmium exposure on bone, possibly exerted via increased bone resorption, which seemed to be intensified after menopause. Based on the prevalence of osteoporosis and the low level of exposure, the observed effects, although slight, should be considered as early signals of potentially more adverse health effects.

The underlying mechanisms of cadmium are still a matter of manifold research activities. While direct interactions with DNA appear to be of minor importance, elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been detected in diverse experimental systems, presumably due to an inactivation of detoxifying enzymes. Also, the interference with proteins involved in the cellular response to DNA damage, the deregulation of cell growth as well as resistance to apoptosis appears to be involved in cadmium-induced carcinogenicity. Within this context, cadmium has been shown to disturb nucleotide excision repair, base excision repair, and mismatch repair. Particularly sensitive targets appear to be proteins with zinc-binding structures, present in DNA repair proteins such as XPA, PARP-1 as well as in the tumor suppressor protein p53. Whether or not these interactions are due to displacement of zinc or due to reactions with thiol groups involved in zinc complexation or in other critical positions under realistic exposure conditions remains to be elucidated. Further potential mechanisms relate to the interference with cellular redox regulation, either by enhanced generation of ROS or by reaction with thiol groups involved in the regulation of signaling pathways. Particularly the combination of these multiple mechanisms may give rise to a high degree of genomic instability evident in cadmium-adapted cells, relevant not only for tumor initiation, but also for later steps in tumor development.

So, it is more likely that cancers would occur in parts of the body other than the bone, and bone may be leaching other minerals and thus developing osteoporosis.

The increased levels of cadmium in the urine of these workers clearly indicates some exposure, which needs further evaluation to determine the source of exposure and likely some remediation in the working environment. The urine level may indicate risks for other cancers and bone issues including resorption and osteoporosis.
