Disease has killed more than 100 colonies of coral in Kaneohe Bay
since the end of February [2010].

Scientists say this outbreak was not unexpected, but they just didn't
believe it would happen for another decade. And Hawaii's coral reefs
face extinction unless they are protected. The disease is called
Acute Montipora White Syndrome.

"Acute just refers to the rapid pace it kills these coral. Montipora
is the type of coral it kills, the rice coral. This particular
disease causes complete mortality or tissue loss," said Dr. Greta
Aeby of the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology.

It has already killed more than 100 colonies of smooth and rice
corals in Kaneohe Bay. And that's the conservative estimate. The
larger ones average about one square yard in size, and take about 15
years to grow.

To get an idea of the magnitude of the problem, in a picture
scientists took of a coral colony in an initial survey, half of the
coral was dead. The other half was alive and healthy. Within a week
the entire mass died.

Corals are living creatures that build reefs providing shelter for
fish and other marine life, so it's important to protect them. Aeby
said: "If those corals break down, our whole ecosystem will crumble,
so we don't want to lose our fish."

She also said the disease can spread rapidly when a coral's immune
system is stressed. Some things that cause stress include man-made
chemicals washing into the bay as runoff from densely populated
areas. "Just be aware what goes on the ground, goes into the water,
that includes rubbish. Don't put excessive fertilizer. If you need to
put pesticides, which we do, minimize it as much as possible. And we
do have a problem with over-fishing, so it's going to make it a
little harder to recover."

Aeby said the reef depends on humans for protection. "What corals
need to grow are clean, clear waters. They need fish that will eat
back the algae. That is the physical environment our reefs flourish
on and will be able to repair under."

In the meantime, researchers are looking for ways to control the
outbreak. A volunteer-based program called "Eyes of the Reef" offers
free training for anyone who wants to understand what a healthy reef
looks like and how to spot anything out of the norm.

The man who drives the boat to and from Coconut Island took the
training class, and that's how he was able to identify the outbreak
in Kaneohe Bay. Aeby said the training takes 2 hours and is open to
anyone.

"If you're a snorkeler, a fisherman, a surfer, anybody that's out, we
can train you on what to look for and then how to report it to us so
we can act upon it like we did in this case. We were able to get into
the water immediately and document it so we can learn from this,"
said Aeby.

[Acute Montipora white syndrome causes rapid tissue loss stripping
corals of live tissue leaving the dead white skeleton underneath.

White Syndrome (WS), a general term for scleractinian coral diseases
with acute signs of advancing tissue lesions often resulting in total
colony mortality, has been reported from numerous locations
throughout the Indo-Pacific, constituting a growing threat to coral
reef ecosystems.

Bacterial isolates were obtained from corals displaying disease signs
at 3 WS outbreak sites: Nikko Bay in the Republic of Palau, Nelly Bay
in the central Great Barrier Reef (GBR) and Majuro Atoll in the
Republic of the Marshall Islands, and used in laboratory-based
infection trials to satisfy Henle-Koch's postulates, Evan's rules and
Hill's criteria for establishing causality. Infected colonies
produced similar signs to those observed in the field following
exposure to bacterial concentrations of ca. 10^6 cells ml-1.
Phylogenetic 16S rRNA gene analysis demonstrated that all 6 pathogens
identified in this study were members of the _Proteobacteria_ family
_Vibrionacae_, each with greater than 98 percent sequence identity
with the previously characterized coral bleaching pathogen _Vibrio
coralliilyticus_. Screening for proteolytic activity of more than 150
coral-derived bacterial isolates by a biochemical assay and specific
primers for a _Vibrio_ family zinc-metalloprotease demonstrated a
significant association between the presence of isolates capable of
proteolytic activity and observed disease signs.

This White Syndrome (WS) has been occurring for several years, with
cases documented in Australia, Hawaii and other areas. The dying
coral is not a good sign regarding health of the oceans or the world,
as corals, bees, and bats are all experiencing some unusual diseases
that have thus far defied control or treatment. While researchers are
working diligently, the diseases march on.
