A 1st case of pneumonic plague was recorded Thu 2 Jun [2022] in the health zone of Rethy, in the territory of Djugu (Ituri). The victim is a man in his 40s living in Belendju village in the Lokpa health area. Following a few symptoms presented, such as fever and headaches, he was taken to the general reference hospital in Rethy, where he was placed in isolation and under treatment. The rapid test carried out revealed the case of pneumonic plague, said doctor Jean de Dieu Dheda.

This situation worries the local health authorities, because this case comes on top of the bubonic plague, which is not yet under control. Indeed, this entity is already facing the epidemic of bubonic plague triggered since March 2022 with 5 deaths out of the 217 positive cases notified. For the moment, the health zone is faced with problems of stock shortages of drugs for the treatment of patients. Apart from this need, explains this doctor, the medical profession lacks protective equipment as well as other items.

The head doctor of the Rethy health zone pleads for assistance in medicines and protective equipment, in order to cut the chain of spread of these diseases.

[This post claims that this is the 1st 2022 case of _Yersinian pestis_ infection in Congo DR related to pneumonic plague.

Most cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea, causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a bubo. Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being bitten.

When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. Bacteremia can also occur as an initial event. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antimicrobial therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. The pneumonic form of infection can spread by the airborne route. - Mod.LL
