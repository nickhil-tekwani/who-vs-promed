While some private doctors in Dabhoi taluka have confirmed the
occurrence of suspected chikungunya cases in village pockets such as
Vadaj, Vadodara district health authorities denied this. Private
doctors said that around 6 months back, some chikungunya cases
occurred in these village pockets, and recently there were reports of
about 15-20 cases of suspected chikungunya from the same area.
On Wednesday [25 Apr 2007], a patient with suspected chikungunya from
Vadaj village, Dabhoi taluka, was treated at the Dabhoi-based Ashish Hospital.
A doctor from the hospital confirmed that clinical symptoms of
chikungunya had been found in most of the cases, as the patients
complained of fever and joint pain. "There are other village pockets
near Sankheda taluka from where people with suspected chikungunya
came to Ashish Hospital to be treated as outdoor patients," said the doctors.
Meanwhile, a team of district health authorities reached the spot to
survey the area. Dr Bhagwat Itare, Chief District Health Officer
(CDHO), said that a pipeline leakage near Dabhoi has been cleared.
"We found 12 people with viral fever, and the chikungunya tests were
negative," he said

[The fact that 12 laboratory tests were negative for chikungunya
virus infection raises questions about the etiology of the other
cases mentioned in this article. ProMED would appreciate any
additional information about these or other suspected chikungunya
cases in this area as it becomes available.
