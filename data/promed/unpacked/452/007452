A large dairy herd in Alpena County and a large beef herd in Montmorency County have become the latest found by the state to be infected with a disease that could potentially harm humans and wipe out farms: bovine tuberculosis.

The potentially devastating disease -- which also is a potential public health issue and has cost Michigan and the federal government more than USD 100 million to fight since the late 1990s -- is persisting in the wild deer herd in northeast Lower Michigan and crossing over into cattle. And that can cause major disruptions and financial hardships to dairy and other cattle farmers because a bovine TB discovery can mean months of quarantine, testing, and often euthanization of part or all of a herd.

["Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious disease of both animals and humans. It is caused by 3 specific types of bacteria that are part of the _Mycobacterium [tuberculosis]_ group: _M. bovis_, _M. avium_, and _M. tuberculosis_. Bovine TB, caused by _M. bovis_, can be transmitted from livestock to humans and other animals."

TB can be passed to a herd by infected cattle, cervids, swine, and humans. It is spread through the inhalation of TB bacteria aerosols, through feed or watering sites contaminated with saliva and other discharges, or by drinking raw, unpasteurized milk from infected animals. The risk of exposure is greatest in enclosed areas, such as barns with poor ventilation.

"Bovine TB is difficult to diagnose with clinical signs alone. In the early stages of TB, clinical signs are not visible. In later stages, clinical signs may include: emaciation, lethargy, weakness, anorexia, low-grade fever, and pneumonia with a chronic, moist cough. Lymph node enlargement may also be present."

There is also a nationwide surveillance program in slaughter plants. If lesions consistent with TB appear on a carcass, a sample is sent to APHIS [Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service] National Veterinary Services Laboratories [NVSL] for confirmation. The state officials will likely be tracing the movements of animals into and out of this herd in an effort to find the originating herd or herds.
