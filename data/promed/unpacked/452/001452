A dengue epidemic in Laos has infected 48 000 people, killing 92, according to a report released today [18 Sep 2013] by the Ministry of Public Health.

Department of Epidemiology chief Dr Chantalay Xayavong said that the number of infected people was stable due to a daily evolution of the situation in the 9 district hospitals in the country and more effective combat against the mosquito that carries the virus. He added that all possible sectors have been mobilized to take part in a broad campaign that also includes fumigation of potential sources, emptying containers of liquids in workplaces, and house-by-house efforts. The population was advised to go to a hospital at the 1st signs of the disease.

Laos is one of the countries hardest hit by the disease in Southeast Asia, followed by Cambodia with 40 deaths and Malaysia with 35. Outbreaks have also been detected in Singapore and the Chinese province of Yunnan, without any deaths reported. However, the situation was worse in the Philippines, where there were 96 000 cases and 372 deaths reported.

[The newswire above reports that dengue fever has killed 92 people in Laos this year (2013) and infected more than 48 000 as the rainy season finally nears its end.

Last year (2012), almost 10 000 people were infected with dengue in Laos, causing 22 fatalities, according to the Vientiane Times news.

Figures recorded from 1 Jan 2013 to 15 Sep 2013 show that in Vientiane alone, more than 16 000 people contracted dengue fever resulting in 25 deaths. Laos has been one of the worst-hit countries in the region this year [2013].

Cambodia has seen nearly 13 000 reported cases of dengue and 40 deaths, while 35 people have died in Malaysia out of more than 18 000 infected. In Singapore, nearly 15 000 people have been infected, while a minor outbreak was also reported in Yunnan province, China, last month (August 2013). The Philippines has been worst hit by the virus, with more than 96 000 cases reportedly leading to 372 deaths (http://www.asianewsnet.net/Dengue-death-toll-in-Laos-reaches-92-51732.html).

According to WHO projections, without immediate and effective action, Lao PDR could have anywhere between 61 000 and 120 000 dengue cases this year (2013), with between 100 and 500 deaths (http://www.unocha.org/top-stories/all-stories/lao-pdr-lethal-dengue-fever-outbreak-kills-92).

There is currently no approved vaccine or specific drug treatment for dengue fever, which globally kills some 20 000 people every year out of between half a million and one million people who become infected with dengue fever.

The higher prevalence of dengue may be related to fluctuating weather patterns and the hot weather and heavy rainfall. Heavy rainfall is a cause for increased numbers of mosquito breeding sites and, subsequently, increased numbers of mosquitoes.
