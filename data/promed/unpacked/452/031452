MALARIA, QUININE RESISTANCE - KENYA: REQUEST FOR INFO

Checking the CDC and WHO websites, and running a Medline search on quinine
resistance and malaria, one comes away with the conclusion this phenomenon
(_Plasmodium falciparum_ quinine resistance) is mentioned as "one liners"
stating that it has been observed in increasing amounts.
Personal communications with a CDC source revealed that the reports of
quinine "resistance" have been primarily reports of probable quinine
non-compliance, where malaria patients have been given a seven day, three
times a day, oral regimen to take as an outpatient with tetracycline at a
seven day, four times a day oral regimen. These are felt to be highly
non-compliant treatment schemes for outpatient medicine.
Reviewing the article below, there is the suggestion that there may be
in-patient treatment failure to quinine. If this is the case, this is
cause for concern as this has not been well documented in the past.
The recommended treatment of _Plasmodium falciparum_ when diagnosed here in
the USA is quinine sulfate and doxycycline combined for one week if the
patient can take oral medications or quinidine gluconate intravenous in
severe cases (cerebral malaria, renal failure or ARDS - acute respiratory
distress syndrome). This report on the emergence of quinine resistance is
of concern, speaking as a physician working in a NYC ER, as we see patients
with malaria (_plasmodium falciparum_) and routinely prescribe the quinine
sulfate and doxycycline one week treatment course (many of our patients are
foreign nationals with histories of chloroquine, fansidar, mefloquine use
in the past, and others are returning tourists from areas with known
multiple drug resistant patterns). It will not be fun to lose that as a
treatment option.
If there is any ProMED-mail subscriber from KEMRI or from the clinical
community in Mombasa who has more information on this issue it would be
very helpful. - MPP

Malaria alert as cases rise
Story Filed: Friday, May 20, 1999 11:45 PM EST

Nairobi (The Nation, May 19, 1999) - A malaria alert has been issued by the
four major hospitals in Coast Province following a steady rise in cases
reported in Mombasa.
All the major health institutions in the town - Coast Provincial General
Hospital, Pandya Memorial Hospital, the Aga Khan Hospital and Mombasa
Hospital - have reported severe malaria cases. But there are fears that the
alert may trigger a further drop in tourism figures since the disease has
been cited as one of the factors influencing tourists to shun the country.
The alert was issued in a letter sent to the Nation and signed by the
administrators of the four major hospitals in the town. The chairman of the
Kenya Medical Association (KMA), Dr Alfred Odhiambo, said that the
association was worried about the rise in malaria cases in the town.
"For the past two weeks, we have had an upsurge of malaria cases, with some
patients being admitted in several hospitals," he said.
Several strains of malaria have proved resistant to quinine. Although he
did not have statistics on the number of patients seen at the institutions
in the past two weeks, he said, the number was alarming.
Dr Odhiambo attributed the crisis to the rainy season, which provides
mosquitoes with very many breeding grounds.
"During this season, the situation usually worsens," he said. "But what is
happening now is terrible."
Dr Odhiambo warned residents against seeking over-the-counter medication.
All residents suffering malaria symptoms must seek treatment from
recognised medical institutions to avoid complications. Dr Odhiambo said
his association was concerned about the mushrooming of medical institutions
that do not meet specifications.
Such medical centres offered drugs to malaria patients who ended up
developing serious complications later, he warned. In the past two weeks,
Dr Odhiambo said, several patients had been admitted to the Intensive Care
Unit suffering from malaria due to use of drugs without professional
doctor's advice.
The KMA boss said the growing resistance to malaria drugs arose from
failure to get correct diagnosis.
