Police in southern Russia hunt anthrax-infected meat
----------------------------------------------------
Local police and agriculture inspectors in southern Russia are
searching for itinerant gypsies [Roma] who may have contracted
anthrax when they bought contaminated meat from a local farm,
authorities said Tuesday [22 May 2007].
Investigators, who followed medical workers cleaning the farm of
Apatovo in Stavropol Territory of an anthrax case that killed a local
resident 12 May [2007], learned that the man who had killed an
infected ox 6 days earlier sold part of its meat to gypsies [Roma].
"Any anthrax case is an emergency," Alexei Alexeienko of
Rosselkhoznadzor, the inspectorate overseeing compliance with
standards and official requirements in the agricultural sector, said.
Outbreaks of anthrax, a potentially fatal disease affecting animals
and humans periodically occur on the rural steppes, part of which
includes the Stavropol Territory neighboring Chechnya.

[The original report had the affected animal being a vaccinated calf.
That it is now an 'ox', age unstated but presumably adult, is much
more likely. Gypsies (Roma) are a significant presence in Eastern
Europe and Russia, and are perceived to move around independently of
the majority population. As they are suspicious of others, sometimes
with cause, it will take very experienced and skilled investigators
to track down the group that bought this meat. - Mod.MHJ]
