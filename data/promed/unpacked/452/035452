KC hospital's inquiry leads to nasal spray recall
---------------------------------------------------
These were unusual bacteria, and they certainly shouldn't have been growing
in the throats of patients at the Kansas City VA Medical Center. The
hospital's ongoing investigation to find the source of these unwanted
microbes already has triggered 2 recent national alerts about an
over-the-counter nasal decongestant spray contaminated with the potentially
dangerous bacteria. The VA's National Center for Patient Safety last week
ordered VA health facilities nationwide to get rid of the spray and on Thu
25 Mar 2004, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a health
alert notice to doctors and public health officials to report any cases
involving the bacteria to health departments and the CDC.
The distributor of Twice-A-Day 12 Hour Nasal Spray on Fri, 26 Mar 2004
broadened its voluntary recall to cover 10 lots of the product, amounting
to 215 000 spray bottles. The initial recall, announced 18 Mar, covered
just one of those lots. Drug stores are being asked to pull the spray from
their shelves, and customers to return it.
"This is just a precautionary measure. We want to make sure the public out
there is safe," said Samir Shah, director of regulatory affairs for Major
Pharmaceuticals in Livonia, Mich.
The bacteria found in the small spray bottles are called _Burkholderia
cepacia_. To healthy people, they don't pose a risk. But to those with
cystic fibrosis, immune deficiencies, or certain blood cancers, the
bacteria can cause pneumonia that could become deadly. "This is a very
unusual organism," said Anita Dixon, the chief of the VA hospital's medical
staff. "It's still concerning us how did we get this." _B. cepacia_ is
found in soil and water, but rarely takes hold in people.
So doctors and nurses at the hospital became concerned in June 2003 when
the bacteria infected the bloodstream of a patient in the intensive care
unit. He was successfully treated with antibiotics, and for months no other
cases were discovered. But in Oct 2003, the bacteria started showing up
occasionally during routine infection-control tests on ICU patients. The
bacteria had simply colonized the patients' throats, meaning the organisms
were living there, but not causing infections.
Concern grew among the hospital's infection control staff in Dec 2003 when
they found a cluster of 6 such cases. The staff hit the Internet, sending
out e-mail to colleagues around the nation. They learned about a hospital
in Colorado that had found a similar cluster of cases among patients who
had undergone sinus surgery. The Colorado hospital had traced the bacteria
to the contaminated nasal spray.
Infection control nurses at the Kansas City VA hospital scoured the
hospital's pharmacy and found 5 bottles of the spray with the same lot
number. They tested them and on 17 Mar 2004 found the bacteria and notified
the Food and Drug Administration.
By this time, the manufacturer, Propharma Inc. of Miami, had already issued
a voluntary recall of one lot of the spray to wholesalers and retailers
based on the findings at the Colorado hospital, said Shah at Major
Pharmaceuticals. The Kansas City hospital notified the VA's National
Center for Patient Safety on 18 Mar 2004. The center confirmed the problem
with Shah and immediately sent out a high-level warning to all VA medical
facilities.
"This one was high enough in acuity we call it an alert," said Bryanne
Patail, a biomedical engineer with the safety center. "It requires them to
pull things from the shelves." That same day, the manufacturer's recall
notice was expanded to notify consumers.
The Kansas City VA hospital also asked the CDC for help tracing the
bacteria. The federal agency now has 3 investigators working at the
hospital. The Kansas City Health Department and Missouri Department of
Health and Senior Services also have been involved in the investigation.

[The above posting delineates the observations and investigations that led
to the recall of the contaminated nasal spray.
It is not clear whether the bacteremic patient (isolated in time to prevent
infection of other patients) had the same strain of _B. cepacia_ found in
the nasal spray bottles. Specific DNA fingerprinting or other differential
testing will be needed to link that case and indeed the current cluster of
patients, who apparently had only upper airway colonization by the organism
contained in the spray. - Mod.LL]
