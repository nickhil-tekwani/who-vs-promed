In a startling revelation, a number of Kanpur zoo employees have been found to be affected by _Leptospira_ and _Brucella_ bacteria. This has been reportedly claimed in a report submitted by a leading diagnostic centre of the city to the Kanpur zoo authorities, giving complete description of the health status of the entire zoo staff.

The diagnostic centre had conducted medical check-up of the zoo employees and confirmed the presence of these bacteria in zoo employees. In September and October [2013], the zoo authorities had gotten their employees to undertake medical tests at a leading private diagnostic centre. The tests performed by this centre revealed that the staffers are suffering from various zoonotic diseases and need proper treatment. The decision to conduct the medical check-up for zoonotic diseases of the entire zoo staff was taken by the zoo veterinarians Dr RK Singh and Dr UC Srivastava.

According to reliable sources, as many as 30 zoo employees are affected with leptospirosis disease (caused by bacteria _Leptospira_) alone. Some 10 zoo staffers are affected with brucellosis, including the zoo director, Kuruvilla Thomas, and zoo veterinarian RK Singh.

Dr Ashish Srivastava, a doctor (member) of a medical panel constituted by the Chief Medical Officer, Kanpur Nagar, on his visit to Kanpur zoo for conducting the health check-up of the zoo staff, told TOI [Times of India] that "the zoo director and zoo veterinarian are affected with _Brucella_ bacteria but there is nothing to worry and neither is there any threat of spread of any epidemic".

"Those who stay in contact with the animals, especially at places like zoos, often suffer from zoonotic diseases. This could be termed as an occupational disease. But there is nothing to worry about. We have already examined 60 zoo employees and the remaining will be examined on Friday [15 Nov 2013]. Also, the required medicines which form the part of the treatment will be given to the zoo authorities in a day or 2," said Dr Srivastava while talking to TOI.

A panel of doctors comprising Dr Ashish Srivastava, deputy District Tuberculosis Officer Dr AP Mishra and 5 other medical staff visited Kanpur zoo on Thursday [14 Nov 2013] to conduct the health check-up of the zoo staff.

The panel of doctors had been constituted by CMO Kanpur Nagar Dr RP Yadav on the request of the Kanpur zoo administration to re-check them against zoonotic diseases and to give them proper treatment for the same.

Contacted, CMO Dr Yadav said, "Those staying around wild animals, especially in places like zoos, are often exposed to these bacteria. Such risk runs in the employees of the Kanpur zoo as well. On the request of the Kanpur zoo authorities, I had constituted a team of doctors who visited zoo on Thursday [14 Nov 2013] and conducted some tests for confirmation of the diseases."

TOI also spoke to zoo director Kuruvilla Thomas. He said, "It was a routine check up of the health of the zoo staff. The team of doctors was the part of the panel constituted by the CMO. The doctors medically examined the zoo staff for zoonotic diseases, including tuberculosis. We will treat the affected persons accordingly."

However, when the zoo director was asked whether he was suffering from any zoonotic disease, he refused to comment.

Zoo veterinarian Dr RK Singh said that the prescribed tests were performed on the zoo staff according to the All-India Service Rules. The zoo authorities also followed the guidelines of the Central Zoo Authority while conducting the health check-up of the staff, he added. However, he too declined any comment about his health.

[Zoos and wildlife reserves often house many species of wild mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles. Because many zoo employees work in close contact with these wild animals, there is risk of transmission of zoonotic diseases from wild animals to humans. Zoonotic diseases that could be transmitted from wild animals in zoos include tuberculosis, rabies, anthrax, leptospirosis, listeriosis, brucellosis, tularemia, campylobacteriosis, salmonellosis, enteric _E. coli_ infections, hepatitis E, Q fever, psittacosis, influenza A, Newcastle disease, hendra virus, nipah virus, herpes B encephalitis, toxoplasmosis, cat scratch disease, SARS, malaria of nonhuman primates, hantavirus infections, ebolavirus and Marburg virus infections, and bacterial and fungal skin infections, to mention only a selection (http://www.absa.org/pdf/ZoonoticFactSheet.pdf). Some are transmitted by direct contact (including animal bites and needle stick injuries), contaminated food, water, aerosol, or bites of arthropod vectors. Some have multiple modes of transmission. A zoo employee with a contagious zoonosis may then become a source for further spread of the infection into the community.

An excellent review on this topic is: Chethan Kumar HB, Lokesha KM, Madhavaprasad CB, Shilpa VT, Karabasanavar NS and Kumar A (2013) Occupational zoonoses in zoo and wildlife veterinarians in India, Vet World 6(9): 605-613. This article reports that there are in India 198 zoos (including circuses), 102 national parks, 515 wildlife sanctuaries, 47 conservation reserves and 4 community reserves for the purpose of wildlife conservation.

It appears from the news report above that so far 60 employees at the zoo in Kanpur, India were examined for the presence of some of these zoonoses. We are not told which zoonotic diseases were surveyed and exactly how the examinations were done, perhaps by history and physical exams, serologies, skin tests (e.g., tuberculin skin test), microbiologic tests (e.g., stool cultures), or chest X-rays. Of the 60 employees examined so far, 30 have evidence, perhaps serological, of leptospirosis, and 10 have evidence, also perhaps serological, of brucellosis.

We are also not told if any of these employees were currently ill as a result of a zoonosis, nor the degree of contact the employees had with the zoo animals. For example, some of the zoo employees with evidence of leptospirosis or brucellosis may have administrative roles with very limited animal contact.

To understand the significance of this prevalence survey, however, we would also need to know if the prevalence of these diseases in zoo employees reflects their prevalence in the general community. (See: Forsyth MB, Morris AJ, Sinclair DA, Pritchard CP. Investigation of zoonotic infections among Auckland Zoo staff: 1991-2010. Zoonoses Public Health. 2012;59(8):561-7. Abstract available at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?orig_db=PubMed&cmd=search&cmd_current=&term=Forsyth%20MB%20%E2%80%8E2012%20.) What percent of the general population in Kanpur has evidence of leptospirosis or brucellosis? Further information on the situation at the Kanpur zoo by knowledgeable individuals would be greatly appreciated.

Kanpur is a city of almost 2.8 million residents in Uttar Pradesh, India (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanpur#Geography.)
