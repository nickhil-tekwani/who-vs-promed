Dengue Fever continues to circulate in Fiji, with more than 1,300
suspected cases reported in the last two weeks. Nearly 200 people have
been hospitalised since March 10, mostly in the Northern Division, and
in the outer islands of Kadavu and Lakeba. Fortunately, there were no
deaths reported to the Ministry of Health during March, and the death
toll remains at 11.
In the Northern Division, Labasa Hospital reported a rise in cases in
the past week, with at least 12 admissions, and 40 suspected cases. A
special Dengue clinic has been set up in anticipation of a rise in
cases. No reports have been received from the rest of the Northern
Division in the last two weeks.
Case reports in Kadavu have nearly doubled in the last two weeks, with
more than 7.5% of the population affected to date, up from 3.9% two
weeks ago. More than 200 persons have been hospitalised in the outer
islands of the Eastern Division since the epidemic began, and nearly 3%
of the population has been affected.
Cases continue to be reported from most areas of the country,
particularly Suva, Tailevu, Naitasiri, and Rewa. While case reports
appear to have declined in the Western Division in recent weeks, there
were still at least 40 admissions and more than 200 suspected cases
reported in the last two weeks.
The public was reminded to continue to protect itself from mosquito
bites, to destroy places where mosquitos may breed (including standing
water around human dwellings), and to seek medical treatment for fevers
lasting longer than three days. The public was also advised that there
have been at least two reported deaths due to leptospirosis, which can
often be confused with Dengue Fever, but unlike Dengue, requires
treatment with antibiotics.
