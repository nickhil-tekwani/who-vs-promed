Waning MMR immunity, vaccine hesitancy, could mean more measles outbreaks.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of 62 studies has found that immunity conferred by the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine fades each subsequent year, suggesting that vaccination strategies should be revisited.

The study, published yesterday [1 Sep 2020] in The Lancet Infectious Diseases, showed that 96.0% of patients inoculated with the 2-dose trivalent MMR vaccine initially developed antibodies against measles, while 93.3% had antibodies against mumps when excluding the Rubini strain (91.1% when including it), and 98.3% produced protective antibodies against rubella. But that immunity lessened each year.

The decreases in immunity could help explain continued measles outbreaks even in countries with high vaccine coverage, the authors said. "Our meta-analysis provides estimates of primary and secondary vaccine failure, which are essential to improve the accuracy of mathematical and statistical modelling to understand and predict the occurrence of future measles, mumps, and rubella outbreaks in countries with high vaccine uptake," they wrote.

In a commentary in the same journal [see below], Sara Boccalini, PhD, and Angela Bechini, PhD, of the University of Florence in Italy, said that continuing to administer the MMR vaccine is crucial, but it's important to remember that primary and secondary vaccine failure can still occur.

The study authors' models will help public health experts identify the groups most vulnerable to infection, who may already have lower antibody responses, and inform future vaccination strategies to eliminate measles, Boccalini and Bechini said. They added that wild-type viruses and natural vaccine boosters stop circulating when universal vaccination is implemented, which could exacerbate waning immunity.

In addition, vaccine hesitancy has led to lower MMR vaccine uptake in the past 10 years, and a further drop is anticipated owing to COVID-19, meaning that vaccine-preventable diseases could well rise.

"Because of the aforementioned issues, effective organisation of public health initiatives becomes much more important in each country, to protect susceptible individuals and difficult-to-reach populations," Boccalini and Bechini said. "In particular, health-care workers should ensure that they correctly communicate the effectiveness of the MMR vaccine to the general population."

Summary

Background

Despite the universal use of the 2-dose trivalent measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine in the past 2 decades, outbreaks of these diseases still occur in countries with high vaccine uptake, giving rise to concerns about primary and secondary failure of MMR vaccine components. We aimed to provide seroconversion and waning rate estimates for the measles, mumps, and rubella components of MMR vaccines.

Methods

In this systematic review and meta-analysis we searched PubMed (including MEDLINE), Web of Science, and Embase for randomised controlled trials, cohort studies, or longitudinal studies reporting the immunogenicity and persistence of MMR vaccines, published in English from database inception to 31 Dec 2019. Studies were included if they investigated vaccine-induced immunity in healthy individuals who received a trivalent MMR vaccine, including different dosages and timepoints of vaccine administration. Studies featuring coadministration of MMR with other vaccines, maternal immunity to the MMR vaccine, or non-trivalent formulations of the vaccine were excluded. Pooled seroconversion and waning rates were estimated by random-effects meta-analyses. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42019116705.

Findings

We identified 3615 unique studies, 62 (1·7%) of which were eligible for analysis. Estimated overall seroconversion rates were 96·0% (95% CI 94·5-97·4; I2=91·1%) for measles, 93·3% (91·1-95·2; I2=94·9%) for mumps when excluding the Rubini strain, 91·1% (87·4-94·1; I2=96·6%) for mumps when including the Rubini strain, and 98·3% (97·3-99·2; I2=93·0%) for rubella. Estimated overall annual waning rates were 0·009 (95% CI 0·005-0·016; I2=85·2%) for measles, 0·024 (0·016-0·039; I2=94·7%) for mumps, and 0·012 (0·010-0·014; I2=93·3%) for rubella.

Interpretation

Our meta-analysis provides estimates of primary and secondary vaccine failure, which are essential to improve the accuracy of mathematical and statistical modelling to understand and predict the occurrence of future measles, mumps, and rubella outbreaks in countries with high vaccine uptake.

Comment. Boccalini S and Bechini A. Is it time to reconsider measles, mumps, and rubella immunisation strategies? Lancet Infectious diseases. Published: 01 Sep 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30519-3

Since the late 1990s, measles has continued to be a public health problem, and so WHO launched a global plan for measles and congenital rubella elimination in 1997. Despite the relevant efforts, the goals of elimination have not yet been achieved, and the deadline to reach them has been postponed many times. Moreover, even in areas where high immunisation coverage has been registered, epidemics of measles have occurred in the past 10 years worldwide.

What can be done to eliminate this disease?

Increased immunisation coverage in children and susceptible individuals continues to be the most important way to reach the elimination objectives. However, it is now evident that vaccination uptake should be encouraged in any suitable way. For example, some countries have adopted effective mandatory vaccination, in order to increase coverage.

In addition, it is also necessary to better understand potential problems of immunogenicity (primary vaccine failure) and the waning protection over time (secondary vaccine failure) of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine.

In _The Lancet Infectious Diseases_, Julie Schenk and colleagues did an accurate meta-analysis, which is, to our knowledge, the 1st of its kind on the overall data related to the immunogenicity and antibody persistence after immunisation with trivalent MMR vaccines. Their results show that antibody levels are high (over 91%) soon after immunisation, but they decline over time. These data could be very useful for the future assessment of MMR immunisation strategies and their effectiveness. Thus, continuing to vaccinate is imperative, but we must keep in mind that primary and secondary vaccine failure can sometimes occur.

As reported by the authors, their results are also valuable to build more truthful mathematical models representing transmission of infectious diseases. These models will allow us to identify the most relevant susceptible groups in society and, consequently, the most suitable vaccination strategies to achieve the elimination of measles. However, it will also be crucial to recognise that the circulation of wild-type viruses decreases and natural boosters disappear when universal immunisation is implemented. The reduction of natural boosters could have a further relevant impact on the rate of waning of immunity. This issue in particular must be included in any future consideration of strategies for the prevention of measles.

The authors analysed humoral immunity only, which is a proxy in the estimation of protection, and could therefore underestimate the real level of protection, as cellular immunity was not included. In this sense, low antibody concentrations do not necessarily correspond to a lack of protection. However, these are the best data available so far and, if correctly used, could be very useful in the assessment of future public health decisions. Meanwhile, we are waiting for new scientific evidence on the degree of protection via cellular immunity, in people without detectable antibodies.

Data retrieved in this systematic review are from healthy individuals. Thus, it is reasonable to suppose a lower response (such as lower immunogenicity and shorter duration of protection) in individuals with underlying health conditions. Therefore, attention should be paid to identify and protect these target groups.

Standardisation of serological tests for immunity is also desirable. The definition of a gold-standard cutoff level of seropositivity for protection against measles, mumps, and rubella will allow results that are comparable between laboratories and countries to be obtained, and reliable sero-epidemiological profiles of the population to be established, to identify susceptible individuals to whom prevention activities should be addressed.

In the past 10 years, vaccine hesitancy has led to a decrease in the uptake of the MMR vaccine. At present, a further issue to consider is the impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic on vaccination. During this emergency, a general reduction of immunisation coverage is expected worldwide, as shown by preliminary data registered in the USA.

In the near future, if these negative trends are confirmed, we can foresee an increase in vaccine-preventable infectious diseases. This concern should be kept in mind when planning future catch-up campaigns to immunise individuals who missed vaccinations during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Because of the aforementioned issues, effective organisation of public health initiatives becomes much more important in each country, to protect susceptible individuals and difficult-to-reach populations. In particular, health-care workers should ensure that they correctly communicate the effectiveness of the MMR vaccine to the general population.

Therefore, in the future, we must reconsider the current MMR immunisation strategies, on the basis of the relevant data on primary and secondary vaccine failure, as reported by Schenk and colleagues.

It is helpful to see this metanalysis leading to overall figures for the proportion of the immunized population with waning immunity annually, estimated to be 0·009 (95% CI 0·005-0·016; I2=85·2%) for measles, 0·024 (0·016-0·039; I2=94·7%) for mumps, and 0·012 (0·010-0·014; I2=93·3%) for rubella. These estimates can guide immunization programs, especially for universities and the military where individuals are going to be living in close proximity to each other, and, therefore, boosters may be a good approach to control. The other important point raised is defining a standard cutoff for protection. A low positive serologic result may indicate waning immunity, but at what point is the individual susceptible to re-infection? Cellular immunity also is protective, but generally is not measured. - Mod.LK]

[2] Ethiopia: vaccination campaign

Nearly 15 million children have been vaccinated against measles in Ethiopia in an effort by the health authorities to maintain essential health services, even as they battle to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, according to World Health Organization.

The nationwide campaign which wrapped up this weekend was conducted under the leadership of the Ethiopian Ministry of Health with support from World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The vaccination campaign was initially scheduled for April 2020 but was suspended due to the pandemic and resumed in July 2020.

The campaign ran for 10 days, which is longer than similar past campaigns to limit crowding and risks of COVID-19 infections. Health workers wearing face masks delivered the measles vaccine in open and well-ventilated areas. Other measures such as physical distancing, handwashing and temperature checks were also implemented in compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines.

Ahead of the immunization drive targeting children aged 9-59 months, vaccinators were trained on COVID-19 prevention measures, communities were informed of the campaign and encouraged to turn up, and vaccination supplies as well as personal protective equipment and sanitizers were shipped.

The campaign's target was 15 million children, and it attained 96 percent coverage numbered 14.4 million, showing that even with an ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, countries can continue to carry out life-saving mass vaccinations.

"By taking the appropriate measures, we can continue to provide essential services while striving to end this pandemic. Millions of children are at risk of vaccine-preventable diseases. Hence, waiting for the end of COVID-19 to restart immunization campaigns is a gamble we cannot afford," said Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, World Health Organization regional Director for Africa.

Fewer than 10 of the 47 countries in the WHO African Region are on track to achieve the 2020 measles elimination target of cutting new infections to less than one per one million population. The COVID-19 pandemic threatens to set the region back even further. Initial data from the 1st quarter of 2020 indicates that 1.5 million more African children missed the 1st dose of measles vaccine compared with the same period last year [2019]. Unless vaccination services manage to reach these children in the coming months, the decline adds a significant number of susceptible infants and young children to the existing pool of unvaccinated children across the region, posing huge risks for measles outbreaks.

Measles is a highly contagious disease and one of the leading causes of death among young children globally despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine.

Measles outbreaks remain a risk in all African countries where the routine immunization coverage remains below 95 percent and where periodic supplemental immunization campaigns have been delayed or do not achieve 95 percent coverage in all districts.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, at least 9 scheduled measles vaccination campaigns in Africa were or continue to be at risk of being cancelled, which could result in further outbreaks in 2020 and beyond.

WHO has issued guidance on the importance of maintaining safe immunization services. The guidance provides advice on the criticality of urgent catch-up vaccination when COVID-19 movement restrictions are lifted. It also recommends conducting careful risk assessments before implementing preventive mass vaccination, with attention to appropriate protective measures to avoid COVID-19 transmission.

[Ethiopia is to be congratulated on accomplishing this important childhood immunization campaign against measles in the presence of COVID-19 at the same time, as at least 9 scheduled measles vaccination campaigns in Africa were or continue to be at risk of being cancelled.

Ethiopia followed the guidelines to protect the health workers as well as the children from transmission of SARS-CoV-2. It is important that even during this pandemic that children stay up to date with their vaccinations. Measles may be more of a danger to them than COVID-19.

Worldwide more than 140 000 people died from measles in 2018, according to estimates from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United States Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC). Most deaths were among children under 5 years of age. Babies and very young children are at greatest risk from measles infections, with potential complications including pneumonia and encephalitis (a swelling of the brain), as well as lifelong disability, permanent brain damage, blindness, or hearing loss. - Mod.LK
