WEST NILE VIRUS UPDATE 2002 - USA (09)
**************************************
A ProMED-mail post

ProMED-mail is a program of the
International Society for Infectious Diseases

[Note: Now that West Nile virus infection is endemic throughout much of the
Eastern seaboard of the United States (see: West Nile virus - USA 2001:
final report 20020613.4491), most reports on West Nile virus infection in
year 2002 will be combined and presented as an "update" at regular
intervals. Reports of human infection, infection of new hosts, extension of
geographical range and events of special significance will be posted
immediately on receipt.
The USGS/CINDI West Nile Virus National and State Maps
<http://cindi.usgs.gov/hazard/event/west_nile/west_nile.html> , updated
through Mon 24 Jun 2002, listed the following cumulative West Nile
virus-positive results.
Veterinary (all horses): 10 (Florida 7, Louisiana 3). Kentucky, North
Carolina, Oklahoma & Pennsylvania submitted negative reports.
Birds: 109 in 14 states & DC (Alabama 1, Connecticut 5, DC 1, Florida 4,
Illinois 10, Indiana 4, Louisiana 21, Michigan 2, Massachusetts 4, New
Jersey 6, North Carolina 1, Ohio 22, Pennsylvania 1, Tennessee 5, Virginia
7). [New York was missing, but reports 15 positive birds -- see [7] below].
7 other states submitted negative reports (California, Kentucky, Maryland,
Minnesota, Mississippi, South Dakota & West Virginia).
Note:
Compiling cumulative numbers of West Nile virus-positive birds will become
progressively less meaningful as already 3 states have decided to cease
diagnosis of dead birds after initial confirmation of the presence of West
Nile virus in a county.
Sentinel birds: 3 (Florida 3). North Carolina, Pennsylvania & Texs also
have sentinel birds on duty, all negative so far.
Humans: nil.
These figures represent an increase of 53 West Nile virus-positive birds
and 3 sentinels over the previous totals displayed on 7 Jun 2002. - Mod.CP
******A notable omission from these lists are the first positive birds found
in Texas -- see first ProMED archive report at end of this post. -

Louisiana: 24 More West Nile Virus-infected Birds Reported
-------------------------------------------------------------------
State health officials said 24 more dead birds found in 5 southeastern
Louisiana parishes tested positive for West Nile virus. The virus was found
in blue jays and crows found in East Baton Rouge, St. Tammany, Ascension,
Livingston and Jefferson parishes, the Office of Public Health said in a
news release.
The office added that testing of birds will be suspended in East Baton Rouge
and St. Tammany, as well as on the east bank of Asension Parish -- following
suspension last week in Tangipahoa Parish and Port Allen. "In each of these
areas, health officials know the virus is present and well-established, and
there is no new information to learn by testing more birds in these areas,"
the news release said.

Alabama: First West Nile Virus-positive Crow Confirmed
------------------------------------------------------
The Alabama Department of Public Health announced that West Nile virus (WNV)
has been confirmed in the first bird in the state for 2002 -- a crow found
ill on 29 May 2002 in Coffee County (South Alabama, about 50 miles north of
the Florida border)
The discovery of WNV in Alabama is 3 months earlier than the first case
detected last year, according to state public health veterinarian, Dr. Bill
Johnston. "Considering that southeast Alabama has suffered a drought this
year, finding WNV activity this early should serve as a red flag that
mosquito prevention and avoidance should be stepped up for the remainder of
the mosquito season."

test positive for the virus since 2000. The crow was found on 17 Jun 2002 on
Seneca Avenue near 32nd Street.
No infected birds were found in Niagara County last year. Five dead birds

In New York state 13 dead birds have tested positive for West Nile virus so
far this year. The other 12 birds came from Albany, Monroe, Nassau and
Rockland counties.
