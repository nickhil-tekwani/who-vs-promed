[Israel is on the migration route of wild birds coming from Europe to Africa; avian influenza outbreaks are mostly synchronized with the migration season. Maale Hgilboah, the site of the current outbreak, is close to an aquaculture area with multiple fish ponds, attracting migrating birds. The country's previous HPAI H5N8 event, which involved poultry as well as wild birds throughout the country, started 9 Nov 2016 and was declared resolved 14 Feb 2017. A summarizing map showing the locations of the 33 reported outbreaks is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=21531.

Currently, HPAI H5N8 is known to be circulating in several other Middle Eastern countries, including Iran, Iraq, and Kuwait. - Mod.AS
