First report of _Pantoea stewartii_ in Slovenia
-----------------------------------------------

The NPPO of Slovenia recently informed EPPO of the 1st report of _Pantoea stewartii_ (EPPO A2 List) on its territory. During a specific and official survey, the presence of the bacterium was confirmed in 2 maize (_Zea mays_) [in Goriska region]. Samples had been taken from plants showing decline and long chlorotic streaks on the leaves. In the affected fields, only a few plants showed symptoms.

In the infested area (5 ha) [12.3 acres], maize was cultivated for animal feed (grain and silage) and will be used only for this purpose. The NPPO stressed that in this Western part of Slovenia, maize is not grown for seed production. The origin of this outbreak is unknown, but it is suspected that the import of infected seeds was the pathway of introduction. Official phytosanitary measures have been taken to eradicate the disease.

[Stewart's wilt of maize is caused by the bacterium _Pantoea stewartii_ subsp. _stewartii_. (Pss; previously _Erwinia stewartii_). Symptoms vary on different host varieties but may include leaf stripes, wilting, necrosis of tassels and spots on husks of cobs. Plants may be killed at the seedling stage, infection later in the growth cycle can lead to serious yield losses. Many grassy hosts are susceptible and may serve as pathogen reservoirs.

Primarily, the bacterium is transmitted by and overwinters in insect vectors, but it can also be seed transmitted at a low rate and occasionally overwinters in soil, manure or maize stalks. Insect vectors are mostly responsible for local spread, while infected seed is considered the main route of long distance spread and therefore a quarantine risk. Disease management may include insecticides to reduce vector populations, use of certified disease-free seed and use of resistant maize cultivars.

The pathogen is indigenous to the Americas but has been introduced to some other parts of the world with maize seed. In Europe, Pss had previously only been reported from Italy (ProMED-mail post 20180316.5690019) and Ukraine.

Pss also causes a leaf blight of rice and is considered an emerging pathogen of that crop (as is _P. ananatis_, ProMED-mail post 20170504.5012251). Pss fruit bronzing is considered an emerging disease of jackfruit in southern Asia (ProMED-mail posts 20170905.5294905 and 20171123.5460703).

The genus _Pantoea_ belongs to the family of _Enterobacteriaceae_, which also comprises genera pathogenic to animals or humans. However, the majority of its members are plant-associated. Other species in the genus can cause diseases on a number of crops, such as leaf blights of cereals (_P. agglomerans_), pink disease of pineapple (_P. citrea_), brown stalk rot of maize (_P. ananatis_ and a novel _Pantoea_ species), or center rot of onion (_P. ananatis_). The effects of different bacterial strains on hosts can vary dramatically. The bacteria are generally transmitted by insect vectors, plant material and infected seed, making them a quarantine risk.
