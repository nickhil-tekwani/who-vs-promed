Late blight has been found on tomato and potato plants in several
locations around Fort Pierce, and this week Leon Lucas of Glades Crop
Care has reported that late blight has been found near Immokalee on
tomato plants. This report was confirmed microscopically by the
UF/IFAS [University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural
Sciences] Plant Disease Clinic in Immokalee. At present, barring
further reports from Southwest Florida, the find in Immokalee appears
to be isolated to one location and limited in area.

Given the fact that late blight is present in South Florida and the
weather forecast for the next few days calls for increased chance of
showers and conditions conducive to the spread of the disease,
growers are advised to increase scouting efforts and apply protectant
fungicides, says Gene McAvoy of the Hendry [county] Agricultural
Extension Office in LaBelle.

Late blight is caused by the fungus _Phytophthora infestans_, which
is a pathogen of potato and tomato. Very few vegetable diseases cause
more concern to growers. The disease can spread quickly and devastate
a tomato or potato field within a few weeks if not properly
controlled said McAvoy. Since the disease can spread so rapidly,
McAvoy says growers should scout their fields thoroughly each day,
especially when cool and wet conditions conducive to disease
development prevail.

[Late blight caused by the fungus _Phytophthora infestans_ causes a
devastating disease of potato and tomato with up to 100 percent crop
losses. To a lesser extent, it can also affect other solanaceous
crops such as eggplant and capsicum. The pathogen can affect leaves,
stems, and fruit of tomato causing spots, lesions, and rotting. The
disease can spread rapidly within a crop and destroy it within a few
days. It is highly infectious, and once it is found in a region, all
susceptible crops nearby are threatened. The disease is favoured by
cool, moist conditions, and under favourable conditions epidemics in
tomatoes seem to be even more rapid than in potatoes. Spread often
occurs on infected tomato transplants or other plant material, by
wind, water, or mechanical means. Late blight is not considered a
true seed-borne disease. Solanaceous weeds can serve as pathogen reservoirs.

Disease management requires an integrated approach and includes
phytosanitary measures, removal of weeds, and volunteer crop plants
as pathogen reservoirs, limiting free moisture in the crop,
preventative fungicide treatments of planting material, and fungicide
sprays of crops. Crop rotation with non-hosts may reduce available
inoculum. Commercial tomato cultivars vary in their degree of
susceptibility to late blight, but few are resistant. Sources of
genetic resistance have been identified in wild relatives of tomato,
and breeding programmes are under way.

Late blight is a concern in many countries because new and even more
virulent strains are emerging. Two mating types of the fungus exist,
and where both are present the chances for fitter strains to evolve
are increased further. Since 1990, there have been severe outbreaks
of late blight in commercial and garden plantings of potato and
tomato in both the US and Canada, which were mostly attributed to new
strains, introduced from Mexico.
