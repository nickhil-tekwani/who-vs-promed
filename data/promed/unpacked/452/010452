The Ministry for Primary Industries has killed 10 calves on a North Canterbury farm infected with the_Mycoplasma bovis_ disease. The calves were from a lifestyle property near Rangiora, and were the 6th case of the disease and the only one outside of South Canterbury and North Otago. The ministry bought all 10 calves from the property, so it could kill and autopsy the animals to find out more about the disease.

Victoria Barrell, the ministry's vet in Oamaru, said it was the farmer's decision to sell the infected calves to the Ministry.

"We offered to purchase the 10 calves for research purposes. This presented a unique opportunity for us to better understand and profile the disease process in a group of animals that have been traced from birth.

"Coincidentally, by acquiring and euthanizing these animals, we were able to remove the risk of disease spread in that area of the country."

MPI veterinarians have collected a number of samples from the calves and were expecting results soon.

Ms Barrell said the ministry and farmer worked out what the calves were worth.
"There was no formal compensation, MPI offered to purchase the calves for research purposes." She said the farmer could make a compensation claim under the Biosecurity Act and the ministry has given them advice on this.

The Rangiora property is still in lock down and MPI said it will be a minimum of 60 days before the farm can be grazed again.

MPI 'hopeful' risk gone from North Canterbury

The ministry was hopeful the risk is now over in that region, Ms Barrell said.

"This property was a lifestyle block with just one immediate boundary neighbour and cattle from that property have now been tested.

"The trail effectively ends here."

[This particular pathogen causes a variety of clinical signs from respiratory, to arthritis and mastitis, and can be difficult to diagnose. Hopefully they will learn a lot from these calves and advance our understanding and treatment of this disease. We hope the producer recovers some of his donated cost of animals. - Mod.TG
