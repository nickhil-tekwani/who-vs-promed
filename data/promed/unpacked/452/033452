The Food Safety Directorate in Targovishte [district], northeast Bulgaria, took the carcass of an anthrax-infected cow to an incinerator, where it was destroyed, the press centre of the Bulgarian Food Safety Agency announced.

A farmer slaughtered a cow that had been feeling unwell in a field. He then notified the official vet of the District Food Safety Directorate in Targovishte, who took samples to be tested for anthrax. The initial lab results confirmed the disease.

The place the animal was slaughtered in will be disinfected. No meat from the cow was consumed.

[Targovishte is in northeast Bulgaria in what was Ruse Oblast. It's spelling varies, being Turgovishte in the University of Texas Library map (http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/europe/bulgaria.jpg and in Fallingrain Global Gazetteer (http://www.fallingrain.com/world/BU/60/Turgovishte.html).

Anthrax is sporadic in Bulgaria and the last outbreak in Ruse was in some goats in 2010 with two associated human cases. As the disease is sporadic the farmer and his veterinarian are to be congratulated at suspecting the unexpected with this cow. Presumably there is more to this story than the official account.

A parallel report in Russia [http://tinyurl.com/o36qolh] states that more than 250 animals are due to be vaccinated, and that the last outbreak in this affected village, Ostrets, was 34 years ago. So far there are no human cases. - Mod.MHJ
