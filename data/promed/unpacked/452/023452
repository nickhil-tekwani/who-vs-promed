The city's dog population is under siege from the deadly parvovirus
that has killed at least 9 dogs in a week.
The Australian Veterinary Association, fearing a full-blown outbreak,
has warned dog owners in the inner city to ensure their dogs are
immunized against the gastrointestinal disease that eats away at the
lower intestine.
Cases of the disease are centered in Woolloomooloo, but sick dogs
have been reported in Alexandria, Surry Hills and Redfern. The
association's Sydney branch president, Dr Tony Mosman, said a
significant number of dogs had fallen ill in the past week. If owners
noticed vomiting, loss of appetite or depression, they should contact
their vet immediately, he said.
A Woolloomooloo dog owner, Chris Otavski, 23, said all of the dead
dogs came from the suburb and had died in one week. In total 14 dogs
from the suburb had been infected, he said.
"A lot of people who live here don't speak English so they don't
realize the virus can be spread," he said. "For a long time no one
knew about it at all."
Mr Otavski's dog, an 11-year-old dachshund called Klara, became sick
on Sunday night, but has since recovered. [Recovery may involve much
veterinary care, but is possible. - Mod.TG]
Mr Otavski said he had heard of dogs falling ill with the virus in
Elizabeth Bay, Alexandria, Surry Hills and Redfern.
A City of Sydney spokesman, Jeff Lewis, said several residents of
Woolloomooloo had reported that large numbers of dogs in the area
were suffering from a disease believed to be parvovirus, but only a
few of the reports had been confirmed.
"This particular disease attacks the lining of the digestive system
and is highly contagious among unvaccinated dogs," he said. "City of
Sydney Rangers have been encouraging dog owners to ensure their pets
are vaccinated."
Angela Phillips, a vet at Sydney Animal Hospital in Stanmore, said
dogs could contract the virus, which can survive bleach, by coming
into contact with an infected dog's stool.
She said she usually saw between 1 and 2 deaths each week from the
disease in the summer months.
It costs about A$100 [USD 74] to vaccinate a dog against parvovirus. [This
sounds expensive for a vaccination, but compared with the cost af treatment it
is very reasonable. - Mods.TG/JW].
Parvovirus: How to protect your dog
-----------------------------------
- Puppies should be vaccinated at 6 to 8 weeks old and again at 12 to
14 weeks old.
- All dogs should visit the vet once a year for a booster and check-up.

[Parvovirus can be difficult and unrewarding to treat. It is very
hard on the animal. The lining of the gastrointestinal tract is
denuded and absorption of nutrients is impossible. Consequently the
dogs must be nutritionally supported as well as receiving copious
intravenous fluids to keep them hydrated. Antibiotics are often used
to keep down secondary bacterial invaders, although they do not
affect the virus.
The virus is very hardy and can be easily transmitted. Virkon-S does
kill the virus in kennels and on solid objects. - Mod.TG]
