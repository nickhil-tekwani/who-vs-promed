Foot-and-mouth disease cases still registered in Chitinskaya village
-----------------------------------------------
Single cases of foot-and mouth disease [FMD] are still registered in
the settlement of Srednaya Borzya in the Chita region bordering on
China, where an outbreak of the disease was reported on 13 Jan 2006,
the press service of the Russian Ministry for Emergency Situation's
regional department told Tass on Monday [6 Feb 2006].
A cow and a calf have died over the past few days. The calf died of
an injury, but as it had been ill with FMD before that, its carcass
will be burned also.
According to the press service, 618 cows have recovered from FMD. 74
cows still have symptoms of the disease. There are no ill swine in
the settlement currently, and 41 swine ill with FMD have recovered.
Revaccination of cattle continues in the Kalgansky region. Almost 10
000 cows, over 11 000 sheep and about 5000 pigs have been vaccinated.
1st reports on the disease in the settlement, which is 500 meters
from the river Argunh on the Russian-Chinese border, came on 13 Jan
2006. 2 quarantine posts were set up at the entry into the village.
Private households and vehicles were disinfected.
Specialists believe that the outbreak may have happened because the
vaccination of the cattle against the disease in autumn was
inefficient. Weak immunity failed to protect the cattle from the
virus but made it possible to avoid the loss of cattle.

[Russia notified the OIE about this outbreak on 25 Jan 2006; see 20060130.0289.
No firsthand information on the FMD situation in China's adjacent
Inner Mongolia is available. Envisaged joint investigation by Russian
and Chinese veterinaries into the reasons for the continued incidence
of FMD in boundary areas was announced by Russian officials in
December 2005 (see 20051220.3646). Has this investigation been
carried out? - Mod.AS]
