EV-D68 cases increase to over 150, 7 new states see the infection
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The number of confirmed enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) cases in US children has risen from 130 to 153 and the number of states affected from 12 to 18 in just the past 2 days, according to an update today [18 Sep 2014] from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In addition, California has just announced its 1st confirmed cases, which are not included in the CDC update. States previously affected were Alabama, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, New York, Oklahoma, and Pennsylvania. Now Connecticut, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, Virginia, and California join the list. Canada has seen cases as well, in Alberta and Ontario.

Virginia has reported at least 7 confirmed cases (cases are considered confirmed after testing at CDC or state public health labs). Well over 300 children visited the emergency department at just one hospital, St. Mary's, with 46 admitted, says an ABC News item updated today. "We've never been to this capacity. There [are] a lot more patients and a lot more severely ill than we saw with H1N1," said a pediatrician at the hospital.

According to the CDC (http://www.cdc.gov/non-polio-enterovirus/about/EV-D68-states.html), Connecticut reported its 1st confirmed case yesterday [17 Sep 2014]. It involved a child who was treated at and discharged from a hospital last week, says a notice from the state's department of public health (DPH). Other hospitals in the state have reported suspected cases that await confirmation. Minnesota's department of health confirmed that state's 1st case of EV-D68 as well, according to a story yesterday in the Minneapolis Star Tribune. The story says that "hospitals in the Twin Cities have been flooded with children experiencing severe breathing problems over the past week" and that "the University of Minnesota Children's Hospital is seeing respiratory illnesses at a rate usually only seen during influenza season." The latter facility has confirmed 11 cases in its laboratories. Finally, the California Department of Health (CDPH) announced confirmation of 4 cases there today [18 Sep 2014]. The notice says 3 are in San Diego County and 1 in Ventura County. Other specimens from throughout the state are undergoing testing, the CDPH says.

The EV-D68 illness that is circulating began in mid-August [2014] and has been severe, sending many children to emergency departments or hospitals with wheezing and difficulty breathing. Children with asthma seem to be particularly at risk. More will be reporting cases in coming weeks owing to the fact that several are investigating clusters of respiratory illness and awaiting test results.

[According to the CDC (http://www.cdc.gov/non-polio-enterovirus/about/EV-D68-states.html), in the upcoming weeks, more states will have confirmed cases of EV-D68 infection. The primary reason for increases in cases is that several states are investigating clusters of people with severe respiratory illness, and specimens are still being tested for EV-D68. It can take a while to test specimens and obtain lab results. That's because the testing is complex and slower, and can only be done by CDC and a small number of state public health laboratories. As the backlog of specimens is processed, the number of states and confirmed cases will likely increase. These increases will not necessarily reflect changes in real time, or mean that the situation is getting worse.

Some of the increase will be from new EV-D68 infections since people are more likely to get infected with enteroviruses in the summer and fall. We are currently in the middle of the enterovirus season; as investigations progress, we will have a better understanding of the trends for EV-D68 infections. - Mod.CP
