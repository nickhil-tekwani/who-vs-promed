Cholera and E.coli (HK)
Hong Kong has rules on food preparation but health officials must ensure
offending factories and butcher shops follow the regulations, Dr Lee
Kin-hung, president of the Hong Kong Medical Association told Reuters. "I'm
sure the Urban Services department have their eyes wide open now and it
depends on what follow-up actions they are going to take," Lee said. "The
rules are there but it's how frequently you inspect the place and how
diligently you proceed with prosecution."

[As the Hong Kong press is having a field day revealing yet more food
handling problems, including E. coli O157/H7, we will cut the thread at this
point unless there are any significant new epidemiological reports. MHJ MOD]
