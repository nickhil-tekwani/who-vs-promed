Since the last update on 14 Oct 2015, 71 more ill people have been reported from 23 states. As of 18 Nov 2015, 838 people infected with the outbreak strains of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Poona have been reported from 38 states. The number of ill people reported from each state is as follows: Alabama (1), Alaska (17), Arizona (129), Arkansas (13), California (232), Colorado (19), Connecticut (1), Florida (1), Hawaii (1), Idaho (24), Illinois (9), Indiana (5), Iowa (7), Kansas (2), Kentucky (1), Louisiana (5), Maryland (1), Minnesota (40), Missouri (14), Montana (16), Nebraska (8), Nevada (16), New Hampshire (1), New Mexico (32), New York (6), North Dakota (8), Ohio (3), Oklahoma (13), Oregon (22), Pennsylvania (2), South Carolina (10), South Dakota (3), Texas (42), Utah (58), Virginia (1), Washington (25), Wisconsin (43), and Wyoming (7).

Among people for whom information is available, illnesses started on dates ranging from 3 Jul 2015 to 1 Nov 2015. Ill people range in age from less than 1 year to 99, with a median age of 18. 50 percent of ill people are children younger than 18 years. 57 percent of ill people are female. Among 601 people with available information, 165 (27 percent) report being hospitalized. Four deaths have been reported from Arizona (1), California (1), Oklahoma (1), and Texas (1).

The number of reported illnesses has declined substantially since the peak of illnesses in August and September 2015; however, it has not returned to the number of reported illnesses that we would expect to see (about 5 every month). The investigation into the source of these recent illnesses is ongoing.
