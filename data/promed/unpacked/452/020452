MENINGOCOCCAL MENINGITIS, REPORTING (03)
========================================

[see
Meningococcal meningitis: RFI 970304174525]
Meningococcal disease is quite common in both closed (i.e., college and
military) and open (the community at large) settings, but always seems to
take the press and public by storm. For example, here in Connecticut there
are, on average, 20 cases a year, year in year out. [Not a significant
community threat] from a public health point of view, certainly a big deal to
the affected patient. Yet, each case is the subject of its own "headline"
news piece. The usual routine with isolated cases is to administer rifampin
"prophylaxis" to all those living/sleeping in close quarters with the
identified case. This does not apply to co-workers, other students or other
"friends".
What is news, however, are clusters of cases. So, a few years ago when we
had three cases in 24 hours at the University of Connecticut, and all three
lived in different dorms and had no personal or other association with the
others, we became quite alarmed that we might be sitting on the tip of an
outbreak-iceberg. This had happened the year before at the University of
Illinois with a few deaths. Given the facts (3 cases, no known contact) we
mounted a massive vaccination program and vaccinated about 12,000 students in
a three-day period (in the middle of exams and Mother's Day!). The outbreak
ended and we have had only an occasional isolated case since then.
Hope this helps.
