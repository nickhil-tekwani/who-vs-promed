Viruses, distributed worldwide on cucurbits, cause severe damage to
crops. Virus surveys in 2003 and 2004 were made in all the major
cucurbit-growing areas in Tunisia. Large populations of aphids
(_Aphis gossypii_ Glover) and severe yellowing symptoms of older
leaves of cucurbits were observed in outdoor and under plastic-tunnel
cultivation, suggesting the presence of Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows
virus (CABYV, genus _Polerovirus_, family _Luteoviridae_).

Leaf samples collected from symptomatic and asymptomatic plants of
melon (_Cucumis melo_ L.), cucumber (_C. sativus_ L.), squash
(_Cucurbita pepo_ L.), watermelon (_Citrullus lanatus_ L.), and ware
cucurbit (_Ecballium elaterium_ L. T. Richard) were screened for the
presence of CABYV using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Reference
isolate, CABYV-N (GenBank Accession No. X76931) was provided by H.
Lecoq (INRA-Monfavet Cedex, France).

Sample extracts from fresh leaf tissues were tested using ELISA with
an antiserum prepared against this isolate. In addition, total RNA
was extracted from fresh leaf tissues according to the technique of
Celix et al. (2) using the Titan RT-PCR kit from Roche Diagnostics
(Penzberg, Germany). Forward primer (5'-GAGGCGAAGGCGAAGAAATC-3') and
reverse primer (5'-TCTGGACCTGGCACTTGATG-3') were designed with the
available sequence of the reference isolate.

ELISA tests demonstrated that 91 plants were positive among 160
plants tested with severe yellowing symptoms. All asymptomatic plants
were negative. RT-PCR results yielded an expected 550-bp product that
was amplified from the reference isolate. Of the 160 plants tested
using ELISA, 106 plants were screened with RT-PCR, including the 91
plants that were positive in ELISA. These 91 plants also were
positive after RT-PCR amplification, as were 12 more plants.

This result demonstrated that the RT-PCR test is more sensitive. No
amplicons were produced from extracts of asymptomatic plants, RNA
preparations of Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus (CYSDV), or
Beet pseudo yellows virus (BPYV) positive controls provided by B.
Falk (University of California, Davis). CYSDV and BPYV can induce
similar yellowing symptoms in cucurbits.

The results of the ELISA and RT-PCR tests showed that CABYV is widely
distributed on 5 cucurbit species in the major growing areas of
Tunisia, including the northern, Sahel, central, and southern regions
where it was detected, respectively, in 10 of 25, 11 of 21, 24 of 37,
and 58 of 77 samples tested. CABYV was detected at the rates of 63 of
72 on melon, 10 of 21 on cucumber, 17 of 24 on squash, 10 of 25 on
watermelon, and 3 of 18 on ware cucurbit.

CABYV also seems to be widespread throughout the Mediterranean Basin
(1,3,4), but to our knowledge, this is the 1st report of the
occurrence of CABYV in Tunisia on different species of cucurbit and
ware cucurbit.

[Cucumber aphid-borne yellows virus (CABYV) is a luteovirus with
isometric particles of 25 nm in diameter. The genome of CABYV
consists of a single molecule of positive sense ssRNA. It was 1st
reported in France (Lecoq et al. 1992). So far, it has been recorded
in a few African countries that include Morocco, Sudan, and Zambia
(Lecoq, personal communication). Typical symptoms of CABYV on
cucurbits include yellowing and thickening of old leaves. Yield
reduction in infected cucumber crops can reach about 50 percent
(Lecoq et al. 1992). Major vegetable species susceptible to CABYV
include watermelon (_Citrullus lanatus_), muskmelon (_Cucumis melo_),
cucumber (_C.sativus_), zucchini squash (_Cucurbita pepo_), and
lettuce (_Lactuca sativa_). CABYV can be transmitted persistently by
_Aphis gossypii_ and _Myzus persicae_ (Lecoq et al. 1992). CABYV is
not transmitted mechanically.

According to Abou-Jawdah and colleagues at American University,
Beirut and INRA, France, viral diseases are the major cause of
economic losses in commercial cucurbit production in Lebanon. A
survey revealed that Zucchini yellow mosaic potyvirus (ZYMV) and
Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows polerovirus (CABYV) are the most common
viruses of field-grown cucurbits in Lebanon. Other viruses involved
were Watermelon mosaic potyvirus (WMV), Papaya ringspot
potyvirus-watermelon strain (PRSV-W) and Cucumber mosaic cucumovirus
(CMV).

Inoculation of squash with a mild strain of ZYMV (strain WK) gave
significant protection against severe virus symptoms and resulted in
significant yield increase as compared to the control, as did silver
plastic mulch. The best protection and highest total yield were
obtained with floating row covers (flexible nets or other types of
screens). Integration of cross-protection with silver mulch or
floating row covers improved the protection obtained with either
approach. Cross-protection is still a useful disease management
option for reducing yield loss and maintaining reasonable quality of
product. Resistant curcubit cultivars are not available, but sources
of resistance to CABYV have been identified in melon accessions.

Resistance towards CABYV in Sudanese melons was only detected in the
wild agrestis melons. Among different melon genetic resources
collected from different parts of the world and evaluated for
resistance against CABYV, the Sudanese Humaid accession T-EK 92-2 was
found segregating for resistance (Dogimont et al. 1996). Further, the
wild melon (Humaid) line HSD 2445-005 was found to be homogenously
resistant, while the Humaid accession HSD 2441 was also found
segregating for CABYV resistance
