A dangerous strain of _E. coli_ is feared to have contaminated camembert
cheese sold by more than 100 British retailers, including supermarket chain
Waitrose, said the country's food watchdog late Mon, 19 Dec 2005.
The UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) said the cheeses, which come from
France, may contain the pathogen _E. coli_ O26 and were being withdrawn. It
said the strain can cause severe food poisoning if eaten.
An FSA spokesperson said the recall was a "precautionary measure" after
tests in France identified the unpasteurised camembert as a problem. It is
thought the cheese may have given 6 children in northern France food
poisoning at the start of Dec 2005.
The FSA said no contaminated camemberts had yet been found in the UK. All
batches of the following cheeses were affected: Reaux's Gaslonde Camembert
(250 g packs); Camembert de Normandie Th. Reaux (250 g packs); Reaux's
Gaslonde Camembert 1 kg (normally sold over the cheese counter).
All are made in France by Laiterie Fromagerie du Val d'Ay-Etablissement
REAUX and are distributed in the UK by Anthony Rowcliffe & Son. The FSA
said Rowcliffe had contacted all retailers involved and was arranging
warning notices in shops and newspaper adverts.
The problem was flagged in France on Fri, 18 Dec 2005 by government health
agency Institut de Veille Sanitaire (INVS), after tests on the ill children
confirmed the presence of 2 _E. coli_ O26 strains. INVS said it suspected a
common source and the only one it had found was the unpasteurised camembert.
The producer involved has issued a general recall across France, including
the Reo, Reaux, Laiterie du Val D'ay and le Gaslonde brands. Le Gaslonde
unpasteurized butter was also recalled. All the cheeses involved were
unpasteurized, and this may re-ignite the on-going debate about the safety
of such products. Australia only recently lifted its ban on France's
unpasteurized Roquefort cheese after claiming for years it was unsafe.
The FSA said it was still too early to comment on this, though the watchdog
warns on its website that "young children, elderly people, pregnant women
and people who are ill should avoid unpasteurized milk".
No one at Rowcliffe was available for comment Tue morning, 20 Dec 2005.

The _E. coli_ food alert on some French camembert brands has been extended
to more products in the UK, as the country's food watchdog says batches may
have found their way on to food fairs and farmers' markets.
The Food Standards Agency said it had extended its food alert to Coulommier
cheese, as well as camembert, under the brand names Reo, Reaux, Laiterie du
Val d'Ay & Le Gaslonde.
The unpasteurised cheeses, which come from France and are sold in many UK
retailers including Waitrose, may contain the pathogen _E. coli_ O26. This
can cause severe food poisoning if ingested.
The FSA said it now feared the suspect cheese was being sold on food fairs
and farmers' markets, after local authority investigations revealed some of
the cheese had been imported directly from the French producer, Val
D'Ay-Etablissement REAUX. This may make some batches harder to trace from
the UK.
Anthony Rowcliffe & Son, which distributes some of Val D'Ay's camembert
brands to more than 80 retailers, instigated a full product recall on
Sunday after being informed of the problem by the FSA.
French health agency Institut de Veille Sanitaire announced Friday that it
suspected camembert from Val D'Ay had given at least 4 infants, aged
between 10 months and 2 years, food poisoning at the start of Dec 2005.
Val D'Ay is recalling the affected cheeses and Le Gaslonde butter, which
are sold across France in some of the country's biggest supermarkets,
including Carrefour and Auchan. The firm also exports to other European
countries, such as Germany, Belgium and Italy.

[Although much attention has been paid to O157:H7 strains of _E. coli_ that
(by virtue of toxin production) cause enterohemorrhagic disease with or
without hemolytic-uremic syndrome, other serotypes of _E. coli_ have been
associated with this illness as well.
_E. coli_ strains can be grouped by the presence of their O (somatic) and H
(flagellar) antigens, hence O157:H7. The toxins produced are generally one
or 2 Shiga toxins (stx1 and stx 2) as well as eae, the protein intimin
responsible for attachment of the organism and mucosal effacing lesions,
and other virulence factors including E-hly, espA, etp, and katP.
Other _E. coli_ serogroups that have been associated with VTEC disease
include motile ones such as O26:H11 and O104:H21 and nonmotile ones such as
O111:NM (or H-). Such non-O157 isolates can be obtained from sheep and
cattle and, although causing as much as 30 percent of outbreaks of VTEC
(1), appear to be somewhat less virulent -- or at least more variable in
virulence -- in a variety of in vivo and in vitro assays (2-4). In
analyzing the genetic and phenotypic profiles of non-O157 groups, it has
been found that they belong to their own lineages and have unique profiles
of virulence traits different from O157 (5). The serogroups appearing to be
most prominent are O26 (the agent here), O111, O128, and O103 (6).
If a laboratory is using sorbitol-MacConkey (sMAC) plates to identify VTEC
by virtue of O157's ability to ferment sorbitol, the non-O157 strains will
be missed. In a 3-year pediatric study from the University of Washington,
USA (7), 1851 stool samples were processed for sorbitol fermentation as
well as toxin production by EIA, and 28 strains of O157 were found along
with O103 (4 strains), O118 (2 strains), O111 (2 strains), and 3 other strains.
Clinically, the O157 infections had a higher frequency of bloody stools,
fecal leukocytes, and abdominal pain with shorter symptom duration. 5 (18
percent) of O157 infections developed hemolytic-uremic syndrome; none of
the non-O157 strains did. Since toxin assay did not identify all O157
strains found on sMAC plates, the investigators did not advocate performing
the toxin assay alone.
Non-O157 can produce hemolytic-uremic syndrome, as demonstrated by a
cluster of O121 cases associated with a lake in Connecticut, USA (8).
Since toxin assays are not uniformly performed in many areas, and most
cases do not produce hemolytic-uremic syndrome, it is likely that cases due
to non-O157 strains are being missed. How frequent this phenomenon will
become over time is unclear.
