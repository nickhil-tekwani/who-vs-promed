FDA finds traces of melamine in US infant formula
-------------------------------------------------
Traces of the industrial chemical melamine have been detected in
samples of top-selling US infant formula, but federal regulators
insist the products are safe.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said last month [October 2008]
it was unable to identify any melamine exposure level as safe for
infants, but a top official said it would be a "dangerous
overreaction" for parents to stop feeding infant formula to babies
who depend on it.

"The levels that we are detecting are extremely low," said Dr Stephen
Sundlof, director of the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied
Nutrition. "They should not be changing the diet. If they've been
feeding a particular product, they should continue to feed that
product. That's in the best interest of the baby."

Consumers Union said Wednesday [26 Nov 2008] that the FDA advice is
of small comfort to parents and caregivers. "It is very disturbing to
us that no recall has been requested," said Jean Halloran, the
group's director of Food Policy Initiatives. "The FDA originally said
there was no safe level for these contaminants in infant formula. So
this formula is contaminated."

Halloran said she urged the FDA "to immediately make public all of
the results of its tests for melamine contamination in food," even
those with levels below what would trigger agency action.

Melamine is the chemical found in Chinese infant formula -- in far
larger concentrations -- that has been blamed for killing at least 3
babies and making at least 50 000 others ill.

Previously undisclosed tests, obtained by The Associated Press under
the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), show that the FDA has detected
melamine in a sample of one popular formula and the presence of
cyanuric acid, a chemical relative of melamine, in the formula of a
2nd manufacturer.

Separately, a 3rd major formula maker told AP that in-house tests had
detected trace levels of melamine in its infant formula.

The 3 firms -- Abbott Laboratories, Nestle, and Mead Johnson --
manufacture more than 90 percent of all infant formula produced in
the United States.

The FDA and other experts said the melamine contamination in US-made
formula had occurred during the manufacturing process, rather than
intentionally.

The US government quietly began testing domestically produced infant
formula in September [2008], soon after problems with melamine-spiked
formula surfaced in China.

Sundlof said there have been no reports of human illness in the
United States from melamine, which can bind with other chemicals in
urine, potentially causing damaging stones in the kidney or bladder
and, in extreme cases, kidney failure.

Melamine is used in some US plastic food packaging and can rub off
onto what we eat; it's also contained in a cleaning solution used on
some food processing equipment and can leach into the products being
prepared. Sundlof told the AP the positive test results "so far are
in the trace range, and from a public health or infant health
perspective, we consider those to be perfectly fine."

That's different from the impression of zero tolerance the agency
left on [3 Oct 2008], when it stated: "FDA is currently unable to
establish any level of melamine and melamine-related compounds in
infant formula that does not raise public health concerns."

FDA scientists said then that they couldn't set an acceptable level
of melamine exposure in infant formula because science hadn't had
enough time to understand the chemical's effects on infants'
underdeveloped kidneys.

The agency added, however, that its position did not mean that any
exposure to a detectable level of melamine and melamine-related
compounds in infant formula would result in harm to infants.

Still, the announcement was widely interpreted by manufacturers, the
news media, and Congress to mean that infant formula that tested
positive at any level could not be sold in the United States.

It was not until the AP inquired about tests on domestic formula that
the FDA articulated that while it couldn't set a safe exposure for
infants, it would accept some melamine in formula -- raising the
question of whether the decision to accept very low concentrations
was made only after traces were detected.

On Sunday [23 Nov 2008], Sundlof said the agency had never said, nor
implied, that domestic infant formula was going to be entirely free
of melamine.

In China, melamine was intentionally dumped into watered-down milk to
trick food quality tests into showing higher protein levels than
actually existed.

The concentrations of melamine there were extraordinarily high, as
much as 2500 parts per million. The concentrations detected in the
FDA samples were 10 000 times smaller -- the equivalent of a drop in
a 64-gallon trash bin.

According to the FDA, data for tests of 77 infant formula samples
showed a trace concentration of melamine in one product -- Nestle's
Good Start Supreme Infant Formula with Iron. The FDA had 2 positive
tests on one sample, with readings of 0.137 and 0.14 parts per
million, FDA spokeswoman Judy Leon said Wednesday [26 Nov 2008].

An FDA spreadsheet the AP received Monday [24 Nov 2008] under its
FOIA request attributed those results to Mead Johnson's Infant
Formula Powder, Enfamil LIPIL with Iron. On Wednesday [26 Nov 2008],
Leon said the FDA's spreadsheet contained an error -- that the
information provided to the AP had incorrectly switched the names of
the Mead Johnson product with the Nestle product.

Leon said Wednesday [26 Nov 2008] that a corrected spreadsheet shows
that it was Mead Johnson's Infant Formula Powder, Enfamil LIPIL with
Iron in which FDA detected an average of 0.247 parts per million of
cyanuric acid, a melamine byproduct.

Mead Johnson spokesman Pete Paradossi said the FDA had not informed
his company of any of its test results until an emergency conference
call Wednesday [26 Nov 2008].

The FDA said last month [October 2008] that the toxicity of cyanuric
acid is under study, but that in the meantime, it is "prudent" to
assume that its potency is equal to that of melamine.

And while the FDA said tests of 18 samples of formula made by Abbott
Laboratories, including its Similac brand, did not detect melamine,
spokesman Colin McBean said some company tests did find the chemical.
He did not identify the specific product or the number of positive
tests.

McBean did say the Abbott detections were at levels far below the
health limits set by all countries in the world, including Taiwan,
where the limit is 0.05 parts per million.

The FDA tests also detected melamine in 2 samples of nutritional
supplements for very sick children who have trouble digesting regular
food. Nestle's Peptamen Junior medical food showed 0.201 and 0.206
parts per million of melamine while Nestle's Nutren Junior-Fiber
showed 0.16 and 0.184 parts per million.

The agency said that while there are no established exposure levels
for infant formula, pediatric medical food -- often used in feeding
tubes for very sick, young children -- can have 2.5 parts per million
of melamine, just like food products other than infant formula.

The head of manufacturing for Nestle Nutrition in North America,
Walter Huber, said in an interview that the company took samples
alongside FDA officials who visited a manufacturing plant, and that
those samples showed similar results to what FDA found for the 2
pediatric medical foods. Huber added that Nestle didn't find cyanuric
acid in any of the samples.

Representative Rosa DeLauro, who heads a panel that oversees the FDA
budget, said the agency was taking a "marketplace first, science last"
approach. "The FDA should be insisting on a zero-tolerance policy for
melamine in domestic infant formula until it is able to determine
conclusively based on sound independent science that the trace levels
would not pose a health risk to infants," DeLauro said.

Several medical experts said trace concentrations would be diluted
even in an infant, and are highly unlikely to be harmful.

"It's just a tiny amount, it's very unlikely to cause stones," said
Stanford University Medical School pediatrics professor Dr Paul Grimm.

Dr Jerome Paulson, an associate professor of pediatrics at Children's
National Medical Center in Washington, DC, said he didn't think the
FDA's decision was unreasonable. He added, however, that the agency
should research the impacts of long-term, low-dose exposure, "and not
just assume it's safe, and then 15 years from now find out that it's
not."

[Following the pet food incident in 2007 (see [5] in ProMED-mail
archive no. 20080919.2951), several authorities have performed
preliminary risk assessments.

The US FDA has published an interim safety/risk assessment on
melamine and structural analogues and has established for melamine a
tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 0.63 mg per kg of body weight per day
<http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/%7Edms/melamra.html>.

The European Food Safety Authority has published a provisional
statement and recommends a TDI of 0.5 mg per kg of body weight per
day as the tolerable intake value for melamine.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has published "Melamine and
Cyanuric acid: Toxicity, Preliminary Risk Assessment and Guidance on
Levels in Food"
<http://www.who.int/foodsafety/fs_management/Melamine.pdf>.
This preliminary guidance was developed to assist national authorities
in the decision-making process on possible health concerns of melamine
levels in food. It is proposed by WHO as a 1st pragmatic approach
until more data become available, which would allow a more detailed
assessment.

[Re: "there have been no reports of human illness in the United States
from melamine", this is not surprising since I doubt that any kidney
stones removed from patients in the USA have been analyzed for
melamine content.

The human experiment has already been done unintentionally. As
mentioned in the above report, melamine-containing packaging and
cleaning solutions have been used in food processing for many years,
so there has been human exposure of the population to trace amounts of
melamine for years. Perhaps somebody should start testing autopsy
specimens from selected deaths in the older age groups for melamine
content? - Mod.JW]
