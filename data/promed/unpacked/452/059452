The viral disease mumps has taken hold among a generation of people who weren't vaccinated after the MMR autism scare in the 1990s. Until the end of November 2012, the island had seen 196 cases so far this year [2012]. More have been reported since the beginning of this month [December 2012]. Usually, the figures would be measured in dozens.

Dr Paul Emerson, consultant in public health medicine, said: "It is down to a combination of things. In the 1990s, uptake of the MMR vaccine [among children] fell because of the Wakefield fiasco, which linked MMR to autism and which was proven to be unfounded." That generation, now adolescents and in their 20s, have been hit in the latest outbreak. Those born before 1970, before vaccination, were more likely to have natural lifelong immunity. The MMR vaccine drops off in effectiveness 10 to 15 years after it's given. So anyone who had the jab when they were younger should see their GP again to get a booster.

"Mumps is more serious in men," said Dr Emerson. "It can lead to sterility. It can lead to a nasty fever and pain in the groin area." Women are also more likely to miscarry if they get mumps in the 1st trimester of a pregnancy. Dr Emerson stressed there was no evidence it could lead to foetal abnormalities.

The virus is not as infectious as measles or chicken pox. However, it is spread the same way as flu, though direct contact with saliva, coughing, sneezing, and kissing. Encounters under the mistletoe during the festive season might be best avoided. Dr Emerson advised anyone with mumps to treat the symptoms. Earlier this year [2012], St. George's football team was hit, as 5 players contracted the virus.

Anecdotal reports received at Isle of Man newspapers suggest a number of school classes and workplaces have been affected. Mumps is a serious infection which can cause deafness, among other problems. The MMR vaccine is the best way to prevent mumps. It should be routinely given when children are 12 months old, and a 2nd dose should be given when they are 3 years 4 months old.

[The Isle of Man is a self-governing British Crown Dependency; it is neither part of the United Kingdom nor the European Union, although its foreign relations and defense are the responsibility of the United Kingdom government. The island is 33 miles (52 km) long and 13 miles (22 km) wide and is located in the middle of the northern Irish Sea, between Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland. A map of the Isle of Man can be accessed at: http://www.gov.im/infocentre/townstreetMaps/StreetMap.aspx.

The population of the Isle of Man in 2011 was 83 327, so the more than 196 cases of mumps represents an unusually large outbreak of the disease. Dr Emerson's admonition that: "Encounters under the mistletoe during the festive season might be best be avoided" could be construed as a travel alert. - Mod.CP
