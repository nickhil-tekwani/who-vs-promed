Ohio: Suspected Case of La Crosse Encephalitis
----------------------------------------------
A 12-year-old girl is suspected of having contracted La Crosse
encephalitis. Initial test results suggest that the Lancaster girl may have
the disease, and Fairfield County Health Commissioner Frank Hirsch said on
Mon 30 Aug 2004 that he suspects the child may have contracted it while
camping outside the county. The girl is "doing well" and is at home under
the care of her family doctor, according to a news release on Fri 27 Aug
2004. The state department of health will follow up the diagnosis in 4-6
weeks to confirm or refute the finding.
La Crosse encephalitis is a rare viral disease spread by treehole
mosquitoes. Hirsch said the illness takes 1-2 weeks to manifest itself. The
disease can seriously affect the central nervous system. In rare cases, the
virus can lead to death.
In 2002, a 13-year-old boy from the Thurston area died from La Crosse
encephalitis.
"Residents have to do what they can around their house to prevent the
mosquitoes from breeding," Hirsch said. An average of 70 cases of La Crosse
encephalitis are reported per year [in the United States], according to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The majority of cases reported
are from children younger than 16. Symptoms of the disease include
headaches, fever, stiff neck, drowsiness, lethargy, nausea, vomiting, loss
of appetite, disorientation, mental confusion and sometimes seizures.
The girl's case marks the 2nd mosquito-spread illness found in the county.
In August 2004, the Fairfield Department of Health confirmed a mosquito
pool and 2 birds tested positive for West Nile virus infection. Symptoms of
West Nile virus include headaches, fever, body aches, skin rash and swollen
lymph glands.

[Enhanced surveillance in response to the epidemic of West Nile virus
infection may be responsible for the detection of this case of suspected La
Crosse encephalitis. However, the viruses responsible for La Crosse
encephalitis and West Nile fever are not related. La Crosse virus is
classified in the genus _Orthobunyavirus_ of the family _Bunyaviridae_,
whereas West Nile virus is a member of the genus _Flavivirus_ of the family
_Flaviviridae_. These viruses are transmitted by different vectors and have
different intermediate hosts. - Mod.CP]
