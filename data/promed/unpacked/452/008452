of avian influenza in Cambodia, is derived from AIDE's issue No. 16. FAO is

Avian influenza control in Cambodia
-----------------------------------
Outbreaks:
The 1st case of H5N1 was observed on 15 Dec 2003 at the Tamao Wildlife
Rescue Centre. The 1st case in poultry took place on 24 Dec in a
semi-commercial layer flock in Phnom Penh. This was the 1st case reported
to the Department of Animal Health and Production (DAHP). Investigation
took place on the same day, and the result was reported to the OIE. From 1
Jan to 29 Apr 2004, a total of 91 reports of avian mortality were reported
to DAHP, of which 33 were investigated and 12 were confirmed as H5N1-positive.
Measures:
Currently there are 3 task forces (TF) in the government to handle various
measures: TF-1 (Surveillance, Investigation & Diagnosis); TF-2
(Communication and Mass Media) and TF-3 (Outbreak Control Measures).
Stamping out is usually instituted on suspicion of HPAI on
commercial/semi-commercial operations, but requires owner consent. In cases
involving village chickens, culling of chickens usually takes place at the
infected location.
The Government enforced a Prakas (decree) on 16 Jan that bans cross-border
movements of poultry and poultry products. This may have led a dramatically
reduction in external infection pressure. The Prakas also prohibits
movement of live poultry into or out of the protection zone (3 km
surrounding the affected area), but only after official confirmation of the
outbreak -- often a lag of 2-3 weeks from laboratory confirmation. Due to
the movement control, some commercial farms in the protection zone decided
to sell out all poultry in late January 2004, because they could not afford
the cost for keeping birds. There is a common practice of throwing out
viscera to be scavenged by free-ranging chickens in villages, and this was
a likely factor to virus re-circulation. Poor biosecurity practices appear
to have contributed significantly to the spread of the disease.
There is a need to start active surveillance with commercial poultry
operation providing chicks and feed to many operations around Phnom Penh,
and 3-4 km protection zone would follow in its early stages. Laboratory
competency must be assured when conducting IFAT and HI testing, as these
will be used widely during all surveillance phases. Pathogenicity testing
and detailed sequencing work has not yet been carried out on the Cambodian
H5N1 isolates. Detailed analyses should be conducted in collaboration with
OIE/FAO/WHO reference laboratories.
Clinical signs observed in Cambodia:
Chickens (commercial broilers, layers, and village chickens) are typical of
the HPAI clinical forms; ranging from peracute (sudden death with no
clinical signs) to acute (2-3 days period until death) manifestations,
predominantly seen in younger birds. Lachrymal and nasal discharges,
periorbital edema or generally edematous heads, deep red or cyanotic
wattles and combs, diarrhea and panting was evident in birds surviving
beyond 2-3 days. Soft-shelled eggs characterize affected layer flocks.
Mortality can approach 100 percent in 7-week old birds on an affected layer
enterprise. Morbidity and mortality in older birds is more difficult to
assess, as owners of commercial enterprises often sold their poultry soon
after suspicion of the disease. In a village setting, with a range of ages
and low bird density, mortality varied between 50 and 90 percent at an
individual household level.
Ducks demonstrated a 2-3 day disease course with clinical signs including
lethargy, inability to walk, flaccid necks, and yellow diarrhea. Overall
morbidity reached 10 percent in Black ducks and 20 percent in White ducks.
White ducks appeared to have increased susceptibility with respect to
fatality rates approaching 40 percent in affected individuals.
H5N1 was also isolated in 2 outbreaks involving non-poultry avian species.
A large variety of captive birds as well as free-flying crows were affected
in the outbreak at Tamao Zoo, Kandal province. The disease appeared first
in raptors such as grey-headed fish eagle, serpent eagles, hawk eagles,
spotted wood owls, brown fish owl, spot-bellied eagle owl, and buffy fish
owls in the first 2 to 3 days. The raptors were fed chicken meat or
carcasses obtained from the Kandal Market in central Phnom Penh.
Consideration must be given to the oral point of entry or respiratory if
the contaminated carcass was soiled with affected bird feces. The live
poultry market located approximately 30-40 m away from where the serpent
eagle's enclosure is another possibility. Herons, egrets and cranes were
subsequently affected, suggesting respiratory transmission or mediated
through free or wild birds such as crows, which frequent the aviary areas.
Psittacines were affected in a further outbreak, although only 2 recent
introductions died in an aviary group of 30. A total of 86 birds died and
261 birds remained clinically unaffected. Clinical signs, primarily
lethargy and inappetence, were also evident in zoo cats (tiger, leopard,
etc. all have recovered).

[Recording avian influenza in felines in Cambodia is in agreement with
similar observations in Thailand.
The last official report of Cambodia to the OIE on its avian influenza
situation was sent on 17 Mar 2004. On 9 May, the FAO noted 4 sick birds in
Takeo province (see 20040513.1294). A new official update would be very
helpful. - Mod.AS]

Viet Nam issues new alert on bird flu
------------------------------------
The Vietnamese government has issued an instruction asking localities
nationwide to continue their efforts to prevent the reoccurrence of bird
flu, following the deaths of fowls in several areas, including some testing
positive to avian influenza viruses.
Under the instruction issued by Prime Minister Phan Van Khai, the Ministry
of Agriculture and Rural Development and the People's Committees of
localities must take 4 measures to prevent the return, and rehabilitate the
local poultry industry, local newspaper Pioneer reported Thu, 17 Jun 2004.
1st, they have to actively supervise the usage of state money in recovering
the industry and minimizing the risk of a relapse of bird flu, and quickly
lay a siege to any outbreaks detected to contain them immediately.
2nd, strict controlling measures such as comprehensively disinfecting and
detoxifying farms, residues and landfills must be maintained in areas once
hit by bird flu or being vulnerable to the disease. Dead fowls, if
detected, must be incinerated or buried in a hygienic way.
3rd, the ministry and the committees are to inspect the granting of state
financial assistance to fowl raisers so that the right people receive the
right amount of money, facilitating the recovery and development of the
local poultry industry.
Finally, quarantine activities towards the transport, slaughter and trade
of fowls, and their eggs must be conducted pursuant to veterinary regulations.
In April 2004, the government decided to allocate 245.3 billion Vietnamese
dong (VND) (USD 15.6 million) to 57 localities, helping them prevent bird
flu reoccurrence and revive the poultry industry. Each farmer is to receive
5000 VND (0.32 dollars) for each fowl culled, and another 2000 VND (0.13
dollars) for each chick to be raised in the post-epidemic period.
In late March 2004, Viet Nam declared an end to the bird flu that killed 17
percent of its poultry population and claimed 16 human lives since it broke
out in December 2003. A total of 43.2 million fowls in 57 out of 64
localities nationwide either died or were culled, causing the local poultry
industry to suffer direct losses of 1.3 trillion VND (USD 82.8 million).

[The last official notification of Viet Nam to the OIE on its avian
influenza situation was sent on 13 May 2004, reporting one outbreak in Dong
Thap (see 20040515.1315). The current news item, mentioning "deaths of
fowls in several areas, including some testing positive to avian influenza
viruses" might be indicative of continued activity of the virus. An
official update would be helpful in clarifying the situation. - Mod.AS]
