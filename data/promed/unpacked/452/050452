Adding to the Nipah scare in Karnataka, 3 such suspected cases have been reported in Bengaluru. One suspected case was reported on Monday [28 May 2018] and 2 more cases were reported on Tuesday [29 May 2018].

All 3 patients had travelled to Kerala on a regular basis and had developed fever.

The sample of body fluids of all 3 patients have been sent to Manipal Centre for Virus Research (MCVR), in Manipal near Udupi, and the results are awaited.

It is said that all 3 patients are nurses who work at different private hospitals in the city. Most of the nursing staff in such hospitals are from Kerala, and they do travel to their home towns, doctors said.

"They traveled to their home towns in Kerala and have developed fever and vomiting on their return. They are not hospitalised at present, and they have isolated themselves and are on close monitoring. The symptoms are nothing but that of flu, but as a precautionary measure, their body fluids have been sent for tests. There are chances of the tests coming negative for Nipah virus infection," said Dr BG Prakash Kumar, deputy director, National Vector Borne Disease Control Program, state health and family welfare department.

[The above report does not indicate whether any of the 3 nurses had contact with Nipah patients on their visit to their homes in Kerala. As the above report indicates, the symptoms that the 3 had are general and could be due to a variety of etiological agents. The results of laboratory tests are awaited with interest.

Interestingly, there was an earlier report in Karnataka of another 2 suspected cases of Nipah virus [infection] in Mangaluru and another in Gadag, so Karnataka state has been on high alert. A day later, it was reported that laboratory results stated that 2 of them were negative for Nipah virus infection. So far, the only confirmed cases have occurred in Kerala state.

ProMED-mail rapporteur Mary Marshall furnished a report stating that the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has banned imports of fresh vegetables and fruits from the Indian state of Kerala after an outbreak of the Nipah virus there, the Gulf State's ministry of environment said on Tuesday [29 May 2019] (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-emirates-south-afroca/uae-bans-vegetables-from-indias-kerala-animals-from-south-africa-idUSKCN1IU1I3). This report illustrates how outbreaks like this one in India can have economic repercussions that reach beyond the borders of the state and country where the outbreak is going on. - Mod.TY
