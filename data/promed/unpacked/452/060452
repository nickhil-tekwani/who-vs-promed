A cat in Big Horn has been confirmed to have been infected with plague, the state Department of Health announced [Wed 29 Aug 2018].

There are no known human cases in that area or in Wyoming as a whole. There hasn't been a confirmed case since 2008, according to a department press release. The cat "is known to wander outdoors," the release said.

The case comes a little over a year after the plague was found in prairie dogs in the Thunder Basin National Grassland, the 1st time the disease popped up there in more than 15 years.

"Plague is a serious bacterial infection that can be deadly for pets and for people if not treated as soon as possible with antibiotics," Alexia Harrist, state health officer and epidemiologist, said in a statement. "The disease can be transmitted to humans from ill animals and by fleas coming from infected animals."

Department spokeswoman Kim Deti did not immediately return a request for comment late [Wed 29 Aug 2018] morning.

There have been just 6 cases of plague in humans here since 1978, according to the department. The United States overall averages 7 human cases a year.

Signs in pets include swelling in the neck, face or ears; lack of energy; fever; chills; coughing; vomiting; diarrhea; and dehydration. Humans have similar symptoms, along with difficulty breathing, headaches and abdominal pain.

The department recommends using insect repellent on boots and pants in areas possibly having fleas; using flea repellent on pets; properly disposing of rodents brought home by pets; avoid exposure and contact to rodents dead or alive; and avoid areas with "unexplained rodent die-offs."

[Plague is primarily a disease of wild rodents. It is caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_, which is mainly spread by the bites of infectious fleas. The bacterium is not native to North America. When it was introduced, it became established in some rodent populations. Surveillance efforts testing fleas are very important to detect circulation of _Y. pestis_ and risk of infection.

Plague may infect human beings through several routes: 1) the bite of an infected flea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals (mentioned previously; 2) direct contact with contaminated tissues, generally from an animal; or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of respiratory secretions from infected people or animals.

Clinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front leg (the armpit, if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever. These clinical signs may be present in the dog as well. Swelling under the jaw in cats is frequently mistaken as a cat fight abscess.

Please take your pet to a veterinarian if you notice any abnormalities. Be sure to consult your veterinarian if you find a lump on your pet, as well as to get the best flea prevention treatment for your pet. It may be necessary to have your yard and/or home treated for fleas. Vacuum your home, including any bedding and furniture, and immediately upon finishing take the vacuum back outside, seal it in a plastic bag, and dispose of it. This type of cleaning will have to be repeated every week for 3-6 weeks to break the cycle of the flea in the home. This disease should be taken seriously, so please be sure your pet is on some form of flea prevention.

If your pets are not on flea prevention, please ask your veterinarian about the best flea prevention. Bathing your pet in dishwashing soap is not sufficient to help your pet avoid diseases carried by fleas. Some of the over the counter flea preventions may be harmful to your pet so please check with your veterinarian. It is also a good time to make sure your pet is current on a rabies shot.

Keeping your pets inside is best and inside a yard will help diminish the ability to consume a dead animal and further reduce the risk of plague to your animal and to yourself. - Mod.TG
