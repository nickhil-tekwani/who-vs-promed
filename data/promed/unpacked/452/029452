Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - update 23 May 2014
-------------------------------------------------------------------
On 21 May 2014, the National IHR Focal Point of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) reported 3 additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Abu Dhabi, UAE.

Details of the patients are as follows:
- a 71 year old male in Abu Dhabi. He was admitted to hospital on [11 Feb 2014] and is known to have several comorbidities. On [4 May 2014], he developed fever and on [7 May 2014] tested positive for MERS-CoV by PCR. Currently, he is in a stable condition. He had contact with a previously confirmed case in the hospital: a health care worker (39 year old female) reported to WHO on 11 May 2014. He has no history of contact with animals and no history of consumption of raw camel products.
- a 26 year old male in Abu Dhabi. He was detected through general screening at his workplace on [7 May 2014] without any history of contact to a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case. He tested positive for MERS-CoV by PCR on 8 May 2014. While asymptomatic at the time of screening, the investigation revealed that he had mild cough on 1 May 2014. He has no comorbidities and no travel history. He had contact with animals (cows and sheep but not camels), but has no history of consumption of raw camel products. He was admitted to hospital for isolation on [8 May 2014] and discharged on [14 May 2014].
- a 36 year old male from Abu Dhabi. He developed symptoms, including fever and mild breathing difficulty, on [2 May 2014] and was seen in an outpatient service on [4 May 2014]. His condition deteriorated and he was admitted to hospital on [7 May 2014] with high grade fever and developed breathing difficulty. On [9 May 2014], he tested positive for MERS-CoV by PCR. He recovered and was discharged on [12 May 2014]. He is known to have comorbidities, but reported no contact with a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case and has no travel history. He also has no contact with animals and no history of consumption of raw camel products.

Contact investigations are ongoing and further information will be communicated when available.

Globally, 635 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV have officially been reported to WHO, including 193 deaths. This global total includes all of the cases reported in this update, plus 17 laboratory-confirmed cases officially reported to WHO by Saudi Arabia between 16 and 18 May [2014]. WHO is working closely with Saudi Arabia for additional information on these cases and will provide further updates as soon as possible.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - update 22 May 2014
-------------------------------------------------------------------
On 2 May 2014, the National IHR Focal Point for the United States of America notified WHO about the 1st laboratory-confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection in the United States.

As part of the investigation of contacts of the 1st confirmed case, testing for MERS-CoV was undertaken on contacts. A contact of the 1st case initially tested negative for MERS-CoV by PCR based on respiratory tract samples taken 10 days after contact with the 1st case. However, on [16 May 2014], this contact tested positive for antibodies for MERS-CoV in a blood sample taken 14 days after contact. Currently, this individual is asymptomatic. He is a male in his 70s with comorbidities and has no history of travel to countries outside the United States.

The antibody test result suggests this individual may have been infected with MERS-CoV; however he does not meet WHO's current definition of a laboratory-confirmed case of MERS-CoV, which requires positive PCR tests.

Globally, 632 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV have officially been reported to WHO, including 193 deaths. The global total includes all of the case reported in this update, plus 17 laboratory-confirmed cases officially reported to WHO from Saudi Arabia between [16 and 18 May 2014]. WHO is working with Saudi Arabia for additional information on these cases and will provide further updates as soon as possible.

[According to the WHO updates, the global tally of laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection (confirmed through identification of active viral infection) is now 635 cases, including 193 deaths. This tally does not include the cases reported by Saudi Arabia since 18 May 2014, which are an additional 23 cases and 9 deaths. The addition of these cases would bring the global tally up to 658 cases, including 202 deaths. According to the Saudi MOH, there have now been a total of 554 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection in Saudi Arabia, including 178 deaths -- this represents 84 per cent of the cases and 88 per cent of the deaths in the global tally reported by WHO.

Of note, since the WHO tally includes only cases from which there was evidence of active viral infection, those cases retrospectively confirmed through serologic testing have not been included in the global tally. Hence, the contact case in the USA reported in section [4] above is not included, nor are the 7 additional cases from the 1st documented outbreak of MERS in Jordan in April 2012 who were confirmed through serologic testing. This becomes more and more relevant when evaluating the case fatality rate. At present the case fatality rate is 31 per cent. If more mild, self limited infections or asymptomatic infections are confirmed through serologic studies on either contacts or the general population in the areas where MERS-CoV infections have been documented to have occurred, then the true denominator of the number of infections might well increase significantly, thereby decreasing the calculated case fatality rate further.

Another notable observation in the above reports is the occurrence of a "sporadic" case in a 36 year old male in Abu Dhabi without a history of contact with known laboratory-confirmed cases, nor with animals or raw animal products, nor a travel history. So the obvious question is, what was his risk factor for development of infection? Contact with an individual who was infected but not diagnosed?
