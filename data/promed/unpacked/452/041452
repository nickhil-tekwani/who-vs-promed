YELLOW FEVER - AFRICA (02): NIGERIA COMMENT

The 9 Jan 2019 posting on the yellow fever epidemic [see Yellow fever - Africa: Nigeria, WHO 20190109.6250683] is particularly important for recommendations on the spread of the disease to other potential yellow fever areas, including Africa.

The current outbreak began in Edo State in southeast Nigeria. It may have started as sylvatic (jungle) yellow fever spread by various _Aedes_ species, but the subsequent explosive development is suggestive of urban yellow fever spread by _Ae. aegypti_.

The climate in Nigeria is not uniform. In Edo State and the other areas of the coastal zone in southwestern Nigeria below or west of the Niger River, the climate is characterized by high humidity and hot discomfort for 11 or more months in the year. Presumably, the mosquito can persist year-round in such urban and Local Government Areas (LGAs).

What is of particular concern about the development of urban yellow fever in Nigeria is the spread of yellow fever in the epidemic in Angola in 2016-2017. With modern air travel, possibly assisted by fraudulent yellow fever vaccination certificates, spread was documented both to regions less likely to promote continued propagation (temperate regions in China) and known potential regions of urban yellow fever (Kenya).

Current vaccination recommendations to prospective travelers are considerably influenced by previous occurrences of sylvatic yellow fever. However, the appearance of yellow fever cases in only one area has the potential of initiating spread to any region harboring _Ae. aegypti_. Advice to prospective travelers should be modified to consider this possibility.

Vaccination remains the most important method for the control of yellow fever. Vaccination is rarely accompanied by severe, frequently fatal instances of viscerotropic disease. We are investigating whether genetic immune defects are responsible for these rare reactions. Unfortunately, some individuals without data supporting relative risks have fostered the concept through social media that the vaccine is unsafe. Individuals have then remained unvaccinated, ventured into yellow fever-prone areas, and succumbed to the disease.

The yellow fever vaccine has made large areas of tropical and subtropical regions habitable. The decision to vaccinate, defer travel, or not vaccinate should always consider the relative risks.

[Dr. Seligman is thanked for his thoughtful comments.

Vaccination is the most effective measure to prevent yellow fever cases, since vector control in Nigeria with current technology is not an option.

As noted in the comment from ProMED-mail that Dr. Seligman cites, this outbreak illustrates the dilemma of how best to implement yellow fever (YF) vaccination practice in a country like Nigeria, where, although endemic for the virus, cases occur only sporadically.

A reactive approach, which waits for cases to occur before implementing vaccination campaigns, runs the risk of a major outbreak getting out of hand, as it did in Angola in 2016-2017. Maintaining adequate herd immunity nation-wide through continuous vaccination can be logistically difficult and costly when carried out in both urban and more isolated rural areas. Probably, the best approach is to include YF vaccination as part of routine childhood immunization schemes. The advantage is that once vaccinated, the individual is immune for life, and periodic boosters are not necessary.

Emergency YF virus vector control programs may reduce populations of _Aedes aegypti_ in the short term but cannot be sustained over the long term with current methods. That situation may improve if some of the new approaches for vector control are successful and cost-effective.
