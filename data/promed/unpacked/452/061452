Viet Nam: Avian Influenza Situation - WHO Update 19
---------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health in Viet Nam has confirmed an additional 3 human cases
of infection with H5N1 avian influenza virus. The most recently detected case
was reported on 26 Apr 2005. In the same communication, an additional death
from the disease was confirmed. No further data about these cases have been
provided.

The newly confirmed cases bring the total, in Viet Nam, since mid-December
2004 to 52 cases. Of these patients, 18 have died and 2 are currently being
treated in hospital.

[These figures bring the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases in East
Asia during the period 16 Dec 2004 to 8 Jun 2005 to 56 and the number of
deaths to 22 (see: <http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2005_06_08/en/index.html>).
During this period no cases and no deaths were recorded in Thailand, and the
4 cases and 4 deaths in Cambodia occurred in communities close to the border
with Viet Nam. It appears that the risk to humans of avian H5N1 influenza
virus infection has diminished since the last confirmed human case in the
area was reported on 26 Apr 2005. - Mod.CP]
