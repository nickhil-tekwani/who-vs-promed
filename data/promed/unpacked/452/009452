A cluster of measles cases in a hospital setting in Slovenia
------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
After 10 years of being measles-free, Slovenia experienced a cluster
with secondary transmission in a hospital setting in Mar 2010. The
index case, a resident of Ireland, was hospitalised on the day after
his arrival to Slovenia and diagnosed with measles 2 days later.
After his discharge, 2 cases of measles were notified, a hospital
staff member and a visitor to the clinic, suggesting transmission in
a hospital setting.

Background
----------
Measles is a highly infectious disease which can be successfully
prevented only by vaccination. Notification of measles cases has been
mandatory in Slovenia since 1948. According to the Infectious
Diseases Act, a case of measles (even a suspected case) has to be
reported within 3 to 6 hours to the regional Institute of Public
Health, responsible for public health interventions and from there
immediately to the National Institute of Public Health (NIPH) where
data are collected and analysed. In 2005, the European Union case
definition [1] for measles was widely publicised and general
practitioners and paediatricians were actively encouraged to confirm
every possible case of measles (rash, fever) with appropriate
laboratory diagnosis.

In Slovenia, mandatory vaccination against measles was introduced in
1968 for 12 months-old children. In the 1st years the vaccination
coverage was quite low, but already in 1972 (birth cohort 1971) it
reached 60 percent. In 1979 the coverage reached 80 percent and
increased further in the following years. The 2nd dose of measles
vaccine was introduced in 1978 for children entering school at the
age of 7 years (birth cohort 1971), and was replaced by a combined
vaccine against measles and mumps in 1979. The coverage for the 2nd
dose at 7 years of age reached 90 percent already in the 1st year,
and has been higher than 95 percent since 1983 (data from annual
reports of NIPH) [2]. In 1990, the combined measles-mumps vaccine was
replaced by a trivalent vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella
(MMR); since then children have been immunised with this vaccine at
12 to 18 months (1st dose) and at 6 years of age (2nd dose).

After the introduction of measles vaccination the occurrence of
measles was substantially reduced compared with the highest reported
incidence rate of 407 per 100 000 in 1967, and followed a declining
trend. The size of epidemics decreased and inter-epidemic periods
lengthened. The last case (indigenous) was reported in 1999. The last
reported epidemic started in 1994 and peaked in 1995 when 405 cases
(20.4/100 000) were reported, mostly from 2 regions of Slovenia.

Before the introduction of measles vaccination in Slovenia, measles
was a disease of pre-school children. After that, the age
distribution of morbidity shifted to older age groups. The average
age of reported cases increased gradually from 5.4 years before the
vaccination started (1965-1968) to 11.4 years in the 1990s
(1989-1998) (unpublished data). However, since 1984, an increased
proportion of cases has also been observed among infants under the
age of 12 months who are not targeted by MMR vaccination (although
only 7, 9 and 13 cases were reported in 1996, 1997 and 1998, respectively).

With regard to susceptibility profiles obtained from serosurveys
conducted in Slovenia in 1998 and 2000, the population born before
1960 could be considered immune against measles (the proportion
susceptible was 1.5 percent in those older than 40 years) [3]. Most
people borne after 1971 received 2 doses of measles vaccine. Thus,
the cohorts born between 1960 and 1971 would be most at risk of
getting measles if the infection was imported to the country.

Cluster description
-------------------
On 11 Mar 2010 the NIPH was notified of a suspected case of measles
(Patient 1) in a 19-year-old resident of Ireland, who was
hospitalised in the Clinic of Infectious Diseases at the University
Medical Centre Ljubljana (CID). On the morning of the same day he was
1st examined in an emergency outpatient clinic where he presented
with an atypical rash (a few abdominal papulae). The patient informed
the staff that his brother had been diagnosed with measles a week
before and was hospitalised while travelling through Rome, Italy. The
brother did not accompany the family to Slovenia. Patient 1 was
therefore transferred to CID in the afternoon of 11 Mar 2010, where
he was isolated with fever, a few abdominal papulae, conjunctivitis,
and widespread Koplik spots. A blood sample and throat swab (from
Koplik spots) were taken on the same day.

The patient's serum was tested for measles-specific IgM and IgG by
ELISA (Siemens Enzygnost) and was negative for both. In the swab MV
was confirmed by PCR of the nucleoprotein gene, and material from the
swab was sent for MV isolation and genotyping to the WHO Regional
Reference Laboratory for MMR at the Robert Koch Institute, Berlin.
The detected MV belonged to genotype D4 and was most similar to MV
detected in the UK in 2009. The rash became typical for measles on 12
Mar 2010 and measles-specific IgM resulted positive in another blood
sample on 13 Mar 2010, while IgG was still negative. In the following
days the patient's condition worsened and he developed pneumonia. He
was discharged from hospital on 19 Mar 2010 fully recovered. In the
last specimens taken on that day the IgM titre became lower and
specific IgG antibodies appeared (Table).

The patient came to Slovenia with his family in the evening of the
day before he was admitted to the hospital. He had no contact with
local people as he and his family were sleeping in a caravan. He did
not know if he had been vaccinated against measles. According to his
statement he was a member of the Irish Traveller community [4] and
originating from Limerick, Ireland, where an outbreak of measles was
ongoing in early 2010.

On 24 Mar 2010 the NIPH was notified of another suspected case of
measles (Patient 2) in a health care worker who had been in contact
with the index case at his admission. The patient had fever, sore
throat, muscle aches, vomiting, photophobia, but no typical rash
(only a few papulae in the face). At 1st she was classified as a
probable case of measles. She reported to have been vaccinated at
least once (as she was born after 1971 she was supposed to have
received 2 doses). Serum specimens taken on 23 and 25 Mar 2010 were
tested with ELISA. Both were negative for IgM and positive for IgG
antibodies (400 IU/mL). A throat swab taken on 24 Mar 2010 tested
negative for measles with PCR. An archived serum sample taken from
this patient 6 months earlier showed the same titre of
measles-specific IgG (400 IU/mL) as in the current sera.

Patient 2 was ruled out as a case of measles and therefore was not
part of this cluster. Serological evidence (IgG) indicated that the
patient was fully protected against measles after being vaccinated as
a child, probably with 2 doses, and her symptoms and signs must have
been due to a different viral infection.

Another suspected case (Patient 3) was notified on 1 Apr 2010 in a
health care worker involved in the care of the index case. According
to her self-reported vaccination status she was vaccinated once and
was thus allowed to care for Patient 1. When in contact with patients
she was always wearing a mask. She was tested for immunity to measles
on 16 Mar 2010 (together with other staff members exposed to the
index case at his admission) and was found IgG-negative.
Nevertheless, she was not excluded from work. She was not vaccinated
against measles at that time because she had mild conjunctivitis and
herpes labialis (already on 15 Mar 2010).

On 23 Mar 2010 Patient 3 reported fever, cough and coryza. She
noticed a few papulae on her neck and forehead on 25 and 26 Mar 2010
and some abdominal papulae on 27 Mar 2010. A sample taken on 27 Mar
2010 resulted positive for measles-specific IgG (8,800 IU/mL) and
borderline for IgM. She stayed at home for a week from 29 Mar 2010 to
2 Apr 2010. Throat swab and urine specimens taken on 8 Apr 2010 were
PCR-negative.

On 2 Apr 2010, NIPH was notified of a man in his 50s (Patient 4)
diagnosed with measles at CID on 1 Apr 2010. He had visited his
physician on 23 Mar 2010 with high fever and malaise. As his
condition did not improve he returned on 30 Mar 2010 and was referred
to CID due to high gamma glutamyltransferase levels, high levels of
C-reactive protein and elevated liver transaminase levels, where he
presented on 31 Mar 2010. Measles was suspected on 1 Apr 2010, when a
typical rash appeared. He had noticed the rash on his neck already on
30 Mar 2010 but not payed attention to it. It was assumed from his
age that he was not vaccinated against measles and he did not recall
having had the disease as a child. The diagnosis was confirmed by
serology (positive IgM and IgG) and by positive PCR of the throat
swab taken on 1 Apr 2010. Genotyping was performed at the RKI and
showed 100 percent agreement with the sequence from the MV of Patient 1.

Between 12 and 21 Mar 2010 (after the isolation of Patient 1), this
patient had been visiting twice a day a relative who was hospitalised
on the same ward as the index case. He did not travel during or
shortly before the incubation period and had no known contact with
measles cases. He lives with his wife who had measles in childhood;
other members of the family were vaccinated against measles according
to the vaccination programme.

An alert was issued on 13 Mar 2010 through the Early Warning and
Response System (EWRS) following the diagnosis of the index case. On
2 Apr 2010 the NIPH informed paediatricians and general practitioners
about the outbreak through regional epidemiologists; information
about measles cases was also published at NIPH website. Guidance for
health care workers was prepared; an algorithm for the management of
measles cases was published on the NIPH website.

Discussion
----------
We describe a nosocomial cluster in a highly vaccinated population of
Slovenia. Different manifestations of measles were observed,
depending on the vaccination status of the patients.

Fortunately, measles in the index case was suspected even before the
typical clinical picture appeared. Thus, control measures could have
been implemented in time. However, despite this, transmission to 2
individuals occurred in the hospital setting. The index case was
placed in a single room with anteroom in droplet isolation. No air
conditioner was in place. All health care workers who were exposed to
the index case at admission were tested for immunity against measles
and offered vaccination if measles-specific IgG test was negative,
but they were not excluded from work. Documented evidence of measles
vaccination was not available for all health care workers.

It is obvious that Patient 3 was infected by the index case. As she
reported to be vaccinated once, but tested negative for
measles-specific IgG, she should have been considered a vaccine
failure case (primary or secondary) Nevertheless, she was not
excluded from work despite her susceptibility and exposure history.
The observed rapid IgG antibody response could have been due to
secondary immune response [5,6]. Rising measles-specific IgG in the
absence of IgM in vaccinated cases has been described before [7]. Due
to clinical presentation (mild measles) and antibody dynamics,
Patient 3 was classified as a case of measles due to vaccine failure.
According to some authors, most measles cases in a highly vaccinated
population represent vaccine failure and are vaccine-modified cases
with a lower transmission potential [8,9]. Although it is not very
clear whether individuals with a mild illness who do not display the
full range of clinical signs of measles are capable of transmitting
the virus to susceptible persons, early detection of measles cases
especially in health care workers is important so that appropriate
infection control measures can be implemented in time to reduce the
risk of nosocomial transmission.

It is not clear how Patient 4 was infected. To our knowledge, he had
no direct contact with the index case. It is not very probable that
Patient 3 was the source of infection because the illness in both
cases was reported to start almost simultaneously. There is a
possibility of indirect transmission from the index case.

In case of suspected measles in a hospital setting it is important to
identify susceptible staff (without evidence of vaccination with 2
doses or laboratory evidence of immunity) who should be excluded from
contact with suspected cases. Screening of immunity should be
considered. Only staff with documented measles immunity should
provide care to a suspected measles case.

Conclusion
----------
This small outbreak clearly demonstrated the importance of
implementing all appropriate control measures in health care
settings. In addition, high measles vaccination coverage and strong
surveillance remain critical to prevent future outbreaks.

This well documented analysis of a nosocomial outbreak of measles
virus infection in previously measles-free Slovenia, traces the
origin of the outbreak to a visitor from Ireland, who proved to be a
member of the Irish Traveller [Roma] community. Traveling communities
are always at risk of contracting and spreading childhood diseases
because their itinerant way of life excludes them from the normal
pattern of routine vaccinations.
