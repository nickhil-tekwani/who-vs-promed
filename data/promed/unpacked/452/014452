The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 28 Nov 2018:
- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 426, of which 379 are confirmed and 47 are probable. In total, there were 245 deaths (198 confirmed and 47 probable) and 126 people healed.
- 87 suspected cases under investigation.
- 4 new confirmed cases, 3 in Katwa and 1 in Vuhovi.
- 3 new deaths, including 1 in Katwa, 1 in Butembo and 1 in Beni [North Kivu].
- 1 new person healed out of Butembo ETC.

News of the response
Community involvement
---------------------
- Field teams often face difficult situations. The many incidents, including physical and verbal abuse, are often caused by groups of youth who are hostile to the response activities. To remedy this, several leaders of these youth groups have been trained and hired by psycho-social care teams to support safe and dignified vaccination and burial activities in Katwa. These young people include those who broke into a morgue last week [week of 19 Nov 2018] stealing the body of a person who died of Ebola and bringing it back to the family.

International collaboration
---------------------------
- On Thu 29 Nov 2018, the Deputy Special Representative of the UN Secretary General in the DRC, David Gresley, was in Beni where he met with the National coordinator of the response, Dr Bathe Ndjoloko Tambwe; they spoke about the latest developments in the epidemic and the work done by the teams in collaboration with MONUSCO [UN Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo], which provides important logistical and security support to the response.

Vaccination
-----------
Since the beginning of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 37 559 people have been vaccinated, including 17 733 in Beni, [total numbers of people vaccinated in North Kivu and Ituri provinces can be seen at the source URL above].

2. The #Ebola response is trying to recruit & retrain gangs of hostile youths who've been a real hindrance, threatening team members & undermining their efforts by stealing & exhuming bodies of Ebola victims. Interesting approach.]

[This approach has been taken with dengue, engaging gang members to help implement mosquito control efforts in communities in Central America. It is a great approach for many reasons, and one hopes it will work with Ebola. - Mod.LK]

The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 27 Nov 2018:
- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 422, 375 confirmed and 47 probable. In total, there were 242 deaths (195 confirmed and 47 probable) and 125 people healed.
- 74 suspected cases under investigation.
- 1 new case confirmed in Beni.
- 1 new death in Beni.

News of the response
Campaign against malaria
------------------------
- Following the significant increase in the number of malaria cases in Beni, a campaign against malaria was launched at the town hall of the city this Wed 28 Nov 2018. This 4-day campaign aims to distribute free impregnated mosquito nets and malaria drugs to all households in the city. Reducing the incidence of malaria in Beni will have a positive effect on the Ebola response by reducing the workload of local health care providers and response teams, especially those working at the Ebola Treatment Center (ETC). Up to 50% of people who arrive at the CTE, who are considered to be suspected cases, actually suffer from malaria, whose 1st symptoms are similar to those of the Ebola virus disease.
- The sensitization was made by comedians from the city of Beni explaining the proper use of the mosquito net impregnated as well as the drugs offered. Beni residents were reminded of the importance of visiting the health center at the onset of symptoms and accepting laboratory tests for Ebola and malaria.

Vaccination
-----------
- Since the beginning of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 37 075 people have been vaccinated, including 17 651 in Beni, [total numbers of people vaccinated in North Kivu and Ituri provinces can be seen at the source URL above].

[While the focus has been on Ebola, other diseases are increasing in the region. Malaria looks very similar to Ebola in the early stages, and there are many more cases of malaria. If malaria were brought under control, it would not only improve the health of the individuals, but they wouldn't be exposed to Ebola-positive patients in the treatment centers, and they wouldn't be at risk of infection when medications were administered. -Mod.LK]

[2] Summary
- Thu 29 Nov 2018. WHO update: Ebola virus disease - Democratic Republic of the Congo
[WHO Emergencies preparedness, response, Disease Outbreak News (DONs); edited]
http://www.who.int/csr/don/29-november-2018-ebola-drc/en/

As the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak approaches 5 months since declaration, responding to the outbreak continues to be a challenge; nevertheless, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health (MoH) and partners, WHO remains focused on the ongoing containment efforts to end the outbreak. The MoH, WHO and partners are intensively focusing response activities in areas where EVD transmission continues, including Butembo, Katwa, Beni, and Kalunguta.

During the reporting period (21-27 Nov 2018), 36 new cases were reported: 13 in Beni, 9 in Katwa, 6 in Kalungunta, 6 in Butembo, 1 in Kyondo, and 1 in Oicha [all in North Kivu]. 2 health workers from Katwa and Kyondo were among the newly infected; 42 health workers have been infected to date. 12 additional survivors were discharged from Ebola treatment centres (ETCs) in Beni (6) and Butembo (6), and reintegrated into their communities; 125 patients have recovered to date.

For the past 2 months, WHO has been responding to the developing situation in Katwa, Butembo, Beni, and Kalungunta. Preliminary data indicate an impact of the public health control measures in Beni and Kalunguta. Community engagement remains a challenge in Katwa.

Despite substantial progress, the high proportion of cases who were not previously registered as contacts and therefore not followed-up by the surveillance teams, needs to be improved. Concerns have been raised regarding the high number of young children affected (aged 1 year or less). In total, 36 cases have been reported among newborn babies and children aged less than 2 years and 17 cases among pregnant women have been reported since the beginning of the outbreak.

As of 27 Nov, 422 EVD cases (375 confirmed and 47 probable)1, including 242 deaths, have been reported in 11 health zones in North Kivu Province and 3 health zones in Ituri Province (Figure 1). Given the expected delays in case detection and reporting, overall trends in weekly case incidence must be interpreted cautiously, in the most recent weeks (Figure 2).

The risk of the outbreak spreading to other provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as to neighbouring countries, remains very high. Over the course of the past week, alerts have been reported from South Sudan and Uganda; EVD has been ruled out for all alerts to date.

Figures [available at the source URL above]:
1. Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by health zone in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo, data as of 27 Nov 2018 (n=422)

1.Staggering figures in the weekly DON [Disease Outbreak News] from @WHO today. 36 of the cases so far in the outbreak have been children under the age of 2. So unusual for Ebola. 17 pregnant women. No word on outcomes but my guess is not good -- Ebola's very hard on little kids, pregnant women.
2. The number of #Ebola infections among healthcare workers -- which includes traditional healers, who play a huge role in health care in North Kivu -- is now 42. At least 12 of them have died. The @WHO report is here [see above. - Mod.LK]

- Thu 28 Nov 2018. Ebola DR Congo, 19 die in 5 days
[News24, Agence France-Presse (AFP) report, abridged, edited]
https://www.news24.com/Africa/News/in-eastern-drc-19-die-of-ebola-in-five-days-20181128

The deadly Ebola outbreak which has ravaged eastern Democratic Republic of Congo for nearly 4 months has claimed another 19 lives in just 5 days, the health ministry has said.

The crisis is centered around the restive eastern city of Beni in North Kivu, a region which has been blighted by armed conflict which has hampered efforts to curb the outbreak.

DRC is in the throes of a major campaign ahead of a 23 Dec 2018 election to choose a successor to President Joseph Kabila, who has ruled the vast central African country since 2001.

Since winning independence from Belgium in 1960, this poverty-stricken nation has never known a peaceful transition of power.

- Thu 29 Nov 2018. DRC's 426-case Ebola outbreak now 2nd largest ever
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious disease Research and Policy), abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2018/11/drcs-426-case-ebola-outbreak-now-2nd-largest-ever
[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

Surpassing an outbreak of 425 cases in Uganda in 2000, the current outbreak is now 2nd only in case counts to West Africa's massive 2014-2016 outbreak, which involved more than 28 000 cases and 11 000 deaths.

Powder keg situation
--------------------
The 426-case milestone highlights the powder keg of factors that have made this outbreak persist in spite of the widespread use of an Ebola vaccine that was not available until the tail end of the West Africa outbreak. Difficulties have included violence against health workers and community resistance.

The virus is still being transmitted in 4 villages--Butembo, Katwa, Beni and Kalunguta -- and 36 new cases were reported in the last week (21 Nov through 27 Nov 2018).

The WHO also noted in an outbreak notice today that 36 cases of Ebola have occurred in children under the age of 2 years, and 17 cases have involved pregnant women. In Katwa, contact follow-up has been challenging, and a high proportion of cases were previously unregistered case contacts.

No cases in Uganda [see [3] below]
----------------------------------
Yesterday [28 Nov 2018] the WHO issued a joint statement with the Ministry of Health in Uganda denying media reports that Uganda had its 1st Ebola case. The alleged case-patient was monitored in Kabarole district, Uganda, and blood samples have tested negative for Ebola and other hemorrhagic fever viruses.

Efforts to protect Ugandans from the virus are still under way.

"A total of 1316 front line and healthcare workers in 3 districts have been vaccinated against EVD [Ebola virus disease] to protect this cadre of people against the deadly disease," the statement said. "The Ministry of Health, together with the WHO country office, wish to reiterate that there is no confirmed case of Ebola Virus Disease in Uganda and are working tirelessly to keep the country safe from the deadly disease."

Inadequate infection prevention, control
----------------------------------------
In its situation report, the WHO called the outbreak "unpredictable" and said there have been multiple security incidents at entry points in Beni and Butembo in the last week. Efforts to educate communities about safe and dignified burial (SDB) practices and the screening of education films on Ebola are under way in the region.

"A community burial approach to mitigate the risk of transmission from unsafe burials in areas non-accessible by SDB teams is being piloted in 3 health areas of the Kalunguta health zone [North Kivu] with close cooperation with the respective communities," the WHO said.

More than 22 000 case contacts have been registered since the onset of the outbreak, and as of earlier this week [week of 26 Nov 2018], 4767 were still under follow-up. Beni still has the most contacts lost to follow-up. A total of 37 559 contacts have been vaccinated against the virus.

"The security situation in North Kivu and Ituri continues to hinder the implementation of response activities," the WHO said. The organization has 300 workers in the region.

[3] Suspect cases: not Ebola
- Wed 28 Nov 2018. Uganda: clarification on alleged Ebola death in Kabarole district [not Ebola]
[WHO-AFRO, edited]
https://afro.who.int/news/joint-release-clarification-alleged-ebola-death-kabarole-district

Following media stories on the alleged suspected Ebola death in Kabarole district, the Ministry of Health together with the World Health Organization (WHO) wish to update the public as follows:

1 On 26 Nov 2018, an alert case was received at Fort Portal [Kabarole district, western Uganda] Regional Referral Hospital from Bundibugyo district [western Uganda].
2. The 38-year-old male alert case is one of the many alert cases received in different health facilities as a result of the heightened surveillance along all border districts.
3. Blood samples were taken off the suspect and sent to Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) for further analysis.
4. Results from the UVRI indicate that the patient was negative by PCR for Ebola and other viral hemorrhagic fevers. The districts are aware of these results.
5. Any persons that present with any known symptoms of Ebola is taken on as an alert case until thorough lab investigations are done.

Currently, a number of Ebola virus disease (EVD) preparatory activities are going on across all high-risk districts and these include; coordination of activities; health facility and community-based EVD surveillance, collection and testing of blood samples from alert cases, capacity building for Infection, Prevention and Control, clinical management, psycho-social care and for safe and dignified burials. Risk communication, community engagement and cross-border surveillance are also going on in many districts.

In the same vein, a total of 1316 front line and healthcare workers in 3 districts have been vaccinated against EVD to protect this cadre of people against the deadly disease.

The Ministry of Health together with the WHO country office wish to reiterate that there is no confirmed case of Ebola virus disease in Uganda, and are working tirelessly to keep the country safe from the deadly disease.

https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/weekly-update-ebola-virus-disease-evd-preparedness-south-sudan-update-13-26

Highlights
----------
- The GenXpert laboratory result for the Yambio [Gbudwe state] suspected Ebola virus disease case was negative for Ebola virus. The confirmatory result of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results from Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) also tested negative for Ebola, Marburg, CCHF and RVF [Rift Valley fever].
- The National Task Force (NTF) coordination unit developed a draft document on the composition of NTF. All technical working groups are expected to make inputs before it is adopted by the NTF in the next meeting schedule for Thu 29 Nov 2018.
- The validated SoPs [standard operating procedures] for EVD are awaiting TWG [technical working group] final clearance prior to publication.
- Border health screening has been strengthened with 18 functional screening points. A total 579 716 people have been screened at all the 18 border screening points.
- A joint monitoring team (WHO AFRO, WHO HQ, and UNICEF ESARO [East and Southern Africa Regional Office]) conducted a review of the available IHR and health system assessment/resources (JEE, STAR, midterm health system assessment) to evaluate the country's preparedness and readiness for EVD.
- Entry screening of travelers into South Sudan continues in all the 18 designated sites with support from Ministry of Health (MoH), World Health Organization (WHO), International Organization for Migration (IOM), Save the Children International, (SCI), World Vision International South Sudan (WVISS) and Collegio Universitario Aspirante Medici Missionari (CAUMM). However, the porous entry points remain a major threat. 579 716 travelers have been screened at all the 18 border screening points.

Wed 28 Nov 2018. Experts: Declare Ebola in Congo an International Health Emergency
[New England Journal of Medicine, abridged, abridged, edited]
https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1814296?query=featured_home

ref: Nuzzo JB, Inglesby TV. Perspective. Ramping up the response to Ebola. N Engl J Med DOI: 10.1056/NEJMp1814296
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Though there are clear signs that global preparedness for epidemics has been strengthened, efforts to contain the DRC outbreak have not been sufficient. Additional human and financial resources are needed to prevent this outbreak from becoming a major epidemic.

There are several strengths and capabilities in the DRC that were not available to the Ebola response in West Africa in 2014: the DRC has experience in containing Ebola outbreaks; a new investigational Ebola vaccine has been administered to more than 24 000 people; and the World Health Organization (WHO) is playing a strong leadership and operational role in confronting the outbreak.

Yet efforts to stop the spread of disease haven't succeeded. Since September, the incidence of Ebola has more than doubled, according to WHO situation reports. The majority of people with recently identified Ebola were not on existing lists of contacts of people with previously identified cases -- which indicates a high degree of unrecognized transmission in the community. The virus has spread to 11 DRC health zones, and the WHO has deemed the risk of further regional spread to be very high. There has been some breakdown in disease-control efforts because of security conflicts. In one of the epicenters of the outbreak, Beni, response was interrupted after armed civil conflict and a community-wide strike that followed it. As in previous Ebola outbreaks, some containment efforts have also encountered community resistance

Given the rapidly growing case numbers, limited ability in the field to conduct contact investigations, and high potential for cross-border spread, we believe that declaration of a PHEIC [Public Health Emergency of International Concern] seems warranted now. It would increase both political attention and the financial resources flowing to the control effort. But leaders need not wait for such a declaration before they deepen their commitments: in recognizing the urgency of the concern expressed by the emergency committee, they can act now.

The WHO has transformed its ability to respond to emergencies, but it remains dependent on international support, both technical and financial. It has requested that member states create a Contingency Fund for Emergencies (CFE) to support its work in responding to disease and other crises. To date, however, the CFE has received less than a third of its USD 100 million annual target. More support is clearly needed; it's estimated that the response to the DRC Ebola outbreak alone will cost USD 44 million.

If we do not act now, the outbreak may become far harder and more expensive to stop. After the West Africa epidemic, the United States and other countries made investments to help reform the WHO to enable it to play a more operational and coordinating role during epidemics. But the WHO, the DRC, and local partners won't be able to succeed without sufficient human and financial resources.

Excerpt
-------
The US Embassy in Kinshasa has been closed to the public since [Mon 26 Nov 2018] after issuing an alert about a "credible and specific" terror threat over the weekend [24-25 Nov 2018]. CDC spokesperson Benjamin Haynes told HuffPost that in light of the threat and State Department guidance, it is unclear whether new US response personnel would be able to head to the DRC until 1 Feb [2018] at the earliest, meaning the US response in the country may not be able to surge with the rising cases.

On [Thu 29 Nov 2018], in the Journal of the American Medical Association, over 2 dozen global health leaders called for a surge in CDC workers, not only in Kinshasa but also at the outbreak's epicenter. They are part of a growing chorus of experts urging the return of the CDC on the ground, arguing that without the agency's extensive expertise and resources, this outbreak will continue to grow.

Dr Thomas Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, argued in an article published Wed in the New England Journal of Medicine [see above] that the WHO needed to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The WHO elected not to call a PHEIC for this outbreak earlier last month [October 2018].

"The WHO, DRC, other governments, including the US, and NGOs need to identify ways to intensify efforts beyond what has been possible to date," Inglesby told HuffPost. "If the effort isn't intensified, the outbreak is likely to worsen."

[Reuters, IFRC report, abridged, edited]
http://news.trust.org/item/20181128173128-xnepw
[Byline: Elhadj As Sy]

The question is not whether to stay or leave, but how to stay the course -- both supporting communities at risk, and ensuring the safety of staff and volunteers

Elhadj As Sy is the Secretary General of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies [IFRC].

Responders to the current Ebola epidemic in North Kivu are dealing with an unprecedented scenario. This is the first time that Ebola has found its way into an area where there is complex and violent conflict.

It is a deadly combination on 2 fronts: 1st, the violence is making it difficult - at times even impossible - for humanitarians and health workers to reach remote and at-risk communities. 2nd, the legacy of violence means that even when humanitarians can reach communities, people are often scared and suspicious of the help being offered. It is a vicious cycle.

Against the backdrop of this gloomy picture, responders are walking a tightrope to weigh their humanitarian responsibilities against security concerns, in what has become the worst Ebola outbreak ever to hit the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Humanitarian volunteers open the gateways to these communities by breaking down barriers of fear and misinformation and building trust.

Ebola responders have better access to communities to provide vaccination, healthcare to the sick, support with tracing contacts, and the safe and dignified burials of infected corpses that are so crucial to stopping the disease in its tracks.

- Wed 28 Nov 2018. The struggle to get Ebola vaccine to rebel-held areas of Congo
[Economist, edited]
https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2018/11/28/the-struggle-to-get-ebola-vaccine-to-rebel-held-areas-of-congo

When a young woman living near Beni (the epicentre of the Democratic Republic of Congo's latest Ebola outbreak) came down with a fever, a nurse told her to go to the clinic for a test. But by the time the virus was detected in her blood, she was in the back of a car bumping her way towards Kalunguta, an area controlled by the Mai-Mai, a plundering, raping militia. She probably fled because of a widespread belief that people go to clinics to die.

One week later a cluster of Ebola cases cropped up in a village close to where the woman was hiding. It took 3 days of talks with a Mai-Mai chief before vaccination teams were allowed in. This was too late. The vaccine does not work on those who already have symptoms, which can appear within 48 hours of infection. The disease, which causes copious bleeding and death, spread to 45 people in the area, killing 23.

The overall toll from this outbreak stands at 241, making it Congo's 3rd-deadliest and the world's 4th-largest. Congo, with its long experience in battling the virus -- it had one of the world's 1st recorded outbreaks in 1976 -- is seen as a model for the way in which it isolates and treats people to break transmission. But this outbreak, its 10th, is proving harder to contain. The problem is that Ebola is spreading to areas rife with machete-wielding rebels. Fighting has driven more than 1m people from their homes in the provinces affected by the outbreak.

Geography complicates matters, says Oly Ilunga, the minister of health. The outbreak is near the frontier with Uganda and refugees regularly slip across. It is also the first time in Congo that Ebola has reached a city as big or as bustling as Butembo, a trading stop on one of Congo's few highways. And it has spread through remote villages that are hard to get to at the best of times--and are now reachable only in armoured cars escorted by UN blue helmets.

The new vaccine may yet turn the tide. Without it, thousands of people would have already died, says Dr Ilunga. When health workers reach remote villages they tend to vaccinate everyone in them. This is a change from World Health Organisation's (WHO) standard "ring vaccination" strategy of jabbing only those most likely to come into contact with an Ebola patient. Unfortunately some people refuse, says Michel Yao of the WHO in Beni.

Other weapons are being developed. This week [week of 26 Nov 2018] the WHO began the 1st multidrug trial of potential cures for Ebola. No one knows whether they will work, but the four treatments show promise.

Peter Salama of the WHO reckons it will take at least 6 months to end this outbreak. But Robert Redfield, the CDC director, warns that Ebola may become endemic, or entrenched, in the region. In addition, if new treatments succeed in saving lives, they could also increase the (remote) possibility of survivors becoming carriers of the virus who then pass it on through sex. Either way, it may become necessary to vaccinate whole populations, and not just the people most obviously at risk. If the men with machetes allow it.
