----------------------------------------------------------------------
I was the source of this interesting botulism story. In the initial sentence 'tests have confirmed' was intended to convey that botulism toxin was confirmed by a Queensland laboratory from:
1. The liver of a freshly dead duck
2. Maggots taken from another duck carcass.

Fortuitously, shortly after this outbreak was investigated, there was a 24 hour period of heavy rain, which would have flushed out the ponds, washed the toxin away, and re-oxygenated the water environment making it much less likely to produce conditions where _Cl. botulinum_ thrives. I would expect that some pond invertebrates would remain toxic for some time, since it appears that invertebrates such as maggots are capable of bioaccumulating the toxin. I have not been able to ascertain how long the toxin remains active in the body of a live invertebrate such as a snail or maggot, but presumably it would be at least some days.
