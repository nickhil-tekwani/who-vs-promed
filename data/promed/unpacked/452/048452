Mutar Shu Otho, press secretary of Fashoda County, told Radio Tamazuj on Friday [23 Oct 2015] that hundreds of cattle are at risk of dying in the county due to the spread of various diseases and lack of medicines.

He attributed the cause of the lack of medicines to the withdrawal of many charities working in the livestock in the state due to conflict.

Mutar urged United Nations agencies to provide veterinary drugs to save the livestock in the area.

Meanwhile, the Upper Nile state government spokesperson Daniel Yor confirmed the worsening situation of livestock in other parts of Upper Nile, also due to conflict, preventing aid workers from handing out vaccines.
