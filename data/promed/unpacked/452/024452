At this point, the relationship of the Minnesota isolate to the Chipotle cluster in Washington and Oregon is unclear, but since it has the same genetic fingerprint, there is likely to be a link somewhere.

16 isolates from ill people in Washington (13) and Oregon (3) have been uploaded to the CDC PulseNet database. All 16 people were infected with EHEC O26 that has the same DNA fingerprint. A search of the PulseNet database identified 1 person in Minnesota infected with STEC O26 who has the same DNA fingerprint. This ill person did not eat at a Chipotle Mexican Grill in the week before illness onset. Minnesota's investigation is ongoing. At this time, the illness does not appear to be related to the outbreaks in Washington and Oregon. Whole-genome sequencing, an advanced laboratory technique, is being used to give investigators more information about the DNA fingerprint of the pathogen causing illnesses in Washington, Oregon, and Minnesota.

41 ill people have been reported from Washington (28) and Oregon (13). 14 people have been hospitalized in Washington (10) and Oregon (4). There have been no reports of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and no deaths.

CDC and state and local public health partners are continuing laboratory surveillance through PulseNet to identify additional ill people and to interview them. Updates will be provided when more information is available.

[In analyzing the genetic and phenotypic profiles of non-O157 groups, it has been found that they belong to their own lineages and have unique profiles of virulence traits different from O157 (1). The serogroups appearing to be most prominent are O26, O111, O128, and O103 (2), the former serotype being the implicated strain in this outbreak.

If a laboratory is using sorbitol-MacConkey (sMAC) plates to identify EHEC by virtue of O157's inability to ferment sorbitol, the non-O157 strains will be missed. In a 3-year pediatric study from the University of Washington, USA (3), 1851 stool samples were processed for sorbitol fermentation as well as toxin production by EIA (enzyme immunoassay), and 28 strains of O157 were found along with O103 (4 strains), O118 (2 strains), O111 (2 strains), and 3 other strains.

Clinically, the O157 infections had a higher frequency of bloody stools, fecal leukocytes, and abdominal pain with shorter symptom duration. 5 (18 per cent) of O157 infections developed hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS); none of the non-O157 strains did. Since toxin assay did not identify all O157 strains found on sMAC plates, the investigators did not advocate performing toxin assay alone. Non-O157 can produce HUS, as demonstrated by a cluster of O121 cases associated with a lake in Connecticut, USA (4).

Since toxin assays are not uniformly performed in many areas, and most cases do not produce HUS, it is likely that cases due to non-O157 strains are being missed. How frequent this phenomenon will become over time is unclear.
