An increasing number of dead birds have been showing up in downtown
Kodiak. The die off is attracting the interest of federal officials,
who were initially concerned the birds were dying from an avian
disease. Robin Corcoran is the bird biologist for the Kodiak National
Wildlife Refuge. She says it's a bit of a mystery but someone may be
poisoning or shooting the birds. She says there's another possible
explanation too.

The majority of the dead birds are pigeons, which are not indigenous,
but Corcoran has collected crows and a seagull as well.

Corcoran is concerned that if some of the birds are being poisoned,
eagles, which are protected under federal law, could become poisoned,
too. Corcoran says if the bird deaths expand to migratory or protected
species, they could span local, state and federal jurisdictions.

Corcoran says there are 2 hunting seasons for crows, but not in the
summertime. Pigeons are fair game year-round, and there is no bag
limit.

[When various poisons are used on one species, perhaps viewed as a
nuisance species, other unintended species may become poisoned. Also a
predator species may consume the nuisance species and become poisoned
secondarily.

This article is rather lax in specifics about findings within the
birds, which may support poisonings. Hopefully a necropsy of affected
birds is being done as well as necessary tests to rule out other
infectious diseases like avian influenza.

We look forward to a diagnosis. - Mod.TG]
