4 more polio cases confirmed in Indonesia
-----------------------------------------
Indonesian health authorities confirmed on Monday [20 Jun 2005] that 4 more
children have been infected with polio, bringing to 50 the total number of
people who have contracted the crippling disease in the country's 1st
outbreak in a decade.
Health minister Siti Fadilah Supari told a press conference that all of the
polio cases were confirmed in the West Java and Banten provinces. Siti
explained that 24 out of 50 polio cases were detected in the Banten
district of Lebak, while 18 others were confirmed in the West Java district
of Sukabumi, where the 1st case was identified. 4 other polio cases were
detected in the West Java district of Bogor, while 2 polio cases were
confirmed in the districts of Cianjur and Serang. On 15 Jun [2005],
Indonesian health authorities put the total number of people confirmed to
have polio in the country at 46.
Georg Petersen, head of the World Health Organization (WHO) representative
in Jakarta, said "more polio cases are expected" in Indonesia as the health
ministry is still waiting for the laboratory results of a number of cases
of acute flaccid paralysis. WHO said nearly 500 new polio cases have been
confirmed worldwide this year [2005], and that Yemen is the worst-hit
nation, with 220 cases.
Polio is spread when unvaccinated people come into contact with the feces
of those with the virus, often through water. It usually attacks the
nervous system, causing paralysis, muscular atrophy, deformation and
sometimes death, though only about one in 200 infected ever develop symptoms.

On 20 Jun 2005, 5 new polio cases were confirmed in Indonesia, bringing the
total number of cases to 51. 2 of these cases are from Bogor district, one
from Cinajur, and one from Sukabumi, all in the province of Jawa Berat. The
most recent of these new cases had onset of paralysis on 28 May [2005],
before the immunization "mop-up" campaign held on 31 May to 2 Jun [2005].
The 5th case is from Demak district in Jawa Tengah, a hitherto unaffected
province and outside the area where the "mop-up" campaign was held.

Poliomyelitis in Indonesia - update 5, 20 Jun 2005

[The update from the polio eradication website (number 2 above) is
disconcerting, as it reflects further geographic extension of circulation
of wild poliovirus into an area that had not been covered by the mop-up
campaigns. Geographically, Jawa Tengah is adjacent and to the east of Jawa
Berat. One would not be surprised if the next mop-up campaign were to be
modified to include all of the provinces located on the island of Java. The
discrepancy in total case counts (50 vs 51) reflects the additional case
from Jawa Tengah and may be a question of timing of information released,
with the most recent information released appearing on the polio
eradication website. - Mod.MPP]
