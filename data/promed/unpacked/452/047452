A comment on appropriate level of containment
---------------------------------------------
Professor Kawaoka's team is to be congratulated for successful recreation
of the 1918 influenza virus with it apparent increased virulence for mice.
But if that virulence transfers to humans, I am deeply concerned about his
decision to take the agent from BSL-4 [biosafety level 4] containment to
BSL-3 [biosafety level 3] after finding that level of pathogenicity. We
have already experienced 3 breaks in technique and containment of the SARS
coronavirus this year. Escape of this influenza strain could lead to a
repeat of history that would be completely preventable if that virus were
"put back in its box".
Personally, I would never permit work with this agent under conditions
lower than BSL-4. The University of Wisconsin and appropriate federal
agencies should convene an emergency meeting to sort this out, ensuring
that Dr Kawaoka has ongoing access to BSL-4 containment so that he can
continue this undeniably important work.

[Dr Johnson expresses valid concerns about the disease security aspects of
Dr Kawaoka's research, particularly in view of the finding of the enhanced
pathogenicity of the construct containing the 1918 HA subunit. His call for
a reassessment of the situation should be heeded. - Mod.CP]
