"Now we know the types of leadership, when to apply them, to be leaders to oneself, to manage oneself and others," he said;
- These notions, he said, are very important for crisis management. To this end, he asked the participants in this workshop to use these learned concepts because, he insisted, knowledge is only useful when it is used;
- He took the opportunity to thank not only all the participants for their attendance, but also all the partners who contributed to the success of this training, in particular WHO, CDC, DFID, and Ukaid, not to mention the trainers who attended and moved from Geneva to Goma to equip the Ebola response team of the Ministry of Health and WHO with the Ebola response to the epidemic;

[2] Outbreak summary
- Thu 20 Nov 2019. News & Perspective
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious disease Research and Policy), abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/11/ebola-continues-decline-mobile-patients-still-pose-risk
[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]

A steady decline in the number of Ebola cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) outbreak continued last week, with just 9 new cases reported from 3 health zones, but a new illness was reported from Oicha, which recently passed 30 days with no new cases, according to the latest update from the World Health Organization (WHO).

In other developments, the DRC reported 2 more cases, lifting the outbreak total to 3298, according to the WHO's online Ebola dashboard.

Over the past 3 weeks, the 3 remaining hot spots are Mabalako, Beni, and Mandima. Though the number of cases this week continues to fall, the WHO warned that the outbreak response will continue to face complex challenges, which include rural and hard-to-reach locations.

The case from Oicha was an individual who died in the community, a factor known to pose a high risk of virus spread. Also, the WHO noted that the patient had links to Kalunguta, Oicha, and Mandima health zones. Family members and the community were at 1st resistant to responders, but the WHO said a multidisciplinary team has now started an investigation. So far, it's not known how the person contracted Ebola.

On a positive note, the WHO said all cases from Beni and Mabalako over the past week are linked to known transmission chains, a promising sign that most or all contacts of confirmed cases are being registered.

In its update on entry point monitoring, the WHO described a recent example of ongoing challenges responders face regarding the movement of potentially infected people -- and corpses -- across the outbreak region.

On 17 Nov [2019], a group in a car and on motorbikes moving southward refused screening at the Mavivi checkpoint, near Beni. Officials alerted workers at other checkpoints around Beni, who stopped the convoy, which included the body of a 35-year-old man who died in Oicha and whose family wanted to bury him in Kabasha, located about 12 mi [19.3 km] southeast of Beni. Samples from the man's body were positive for Ebola, and after responders negotiated with the family, a safe and dignified burial was conducted in Kabasha, their hometown.

In its conclusion, noting that high vigilance is needed amid encouraging trends, the WHO said, "While movement of symptomatic cases continues, it is critical that all areas of the response remain effective, engaged, and fully resourced."

Along with the report of 2 new cases, the WHO's dashboard said 537 suspected Ebola cases are still under investigation. No new deaths were reported, keeping the fatality count at 2196.

Yesterday [19 Nov 2019], the DRC's Ebola technical committee (CMRE) said the new death reported yesterday [19 Nov 2019] involved a patient who died at Beni's Ebola treatment center.

The numbers of people vaccinated against Ebola continues to rise. So far, a campaign in 2 Goma health zones to immunize people with the newly launched 2-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine (Ad26.ZEBOV, MVA-BN Filo) has reached 243 people. Meanwhile, 254 151 people have received VSV-EBOV, the main vaccine that has been used since August 2018 to battle the outbreak.

[3] Vaccine news
Date: Wed 20 Nov 2019
Source: Province 26 RDC [in French, machine trans., abridged, edited]

About 50 000 people are affected by this vaccination, which will last 4 months. Until [Mon 18 Nov 2019], 245 people are already vaccinated, which include 172 adults, including 50 women, and 23 children aged 5-18 years. The NGO Doctors Without Borders (MSF), responsible for the implementation of the Johnson & Johnson Clinic study, notes with satisfaction the ownership of this study by the Kahembe and Majengo health area population in Goma, North Kivu. The campaign to introduce this new vaccine into the Ebola response started on [Thu 14 Nov 2019].

"It's going very well," says Veronique Urbaniak, coordinator of the Ebola vaccination project at MSF. "People come slowly and gradually, which is still quite interesting for us. And then, we avoid a large crowd that cannot be vaccinated. And everything happens in a calm and very respectful way. I am very happy with this start of vaccination. For the moment, no incidents. People who come have a desire to get vaccinated because it's voluntary. So, those who do not agree do not come. For the moment, it is going very pleasantly and cordially."

Vaccination is performed by muscle 0.5 ml, in the deltoid muscle of the forearm. Monitoring the safety of the vaccine regimen in completed or ongoing studies has not revealed any safety concerns.

"Our community engagement teams have been active in the neighborhoods for over a month. Now, meeting people, associations that are influential in the neighborhoods, explaining, going door-to-door, doing meetings to answer all the questions the public could have, and trying to bring them the answers, the more transparent [the better]," she adds.

The early onset of the immune response occurs after the 1st dose. It is after the 2nd dose, given 56 days after the 1st, that the substantial increase in antibody response develops. ELISA data (an immunoassay technique that allows the detection and measurement of antibodies) show the persistence of antibodies up to 2 years after the 2nd dose.

This vaccination is made with the vaccine Ad26.ZEBOV / MVA-BN-Filo, produced by the firm Janssen Pharmaceuticals for Johnson & Johnson. It was approved on 22 Oct 2019 by the Ethics Committee of the School of Public Health of the University of Kinshasa and on 23 Oct 2019 by the National Ethics Committee.

This 2nd vaccine comes in addition to the 1st one, the rVSV-ZEBOV, which has been used [so far] in this 10th epidemic. It is manufactured by the pharmaceutical group Merck, after approval of the Ethics Committee on 20 May 2019.

[It is encouraging that the J&J vaccination campaign is underway in Goma, including 23 children ages 5-18 who have already been vaccinated. As pointed out by Mod.LK in Ebola update (108) 20191113.6776731, the J&J vaccine can be administered to children between 1 and 18 years of age, whereas the Erbevo (Merck) vaccine is only approved for people over 18 years of age. We await with interest the results of full-scale vaccination of the targeted 50 000 people. - Mod.LXL
