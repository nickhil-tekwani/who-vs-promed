An outbreak of Rift Valley fever and Crimean Congo fever has been reported in Ankole, [Uganda]. According to reports, the fever is spreading in the districts of Mbarara, Ibanda, Kirihura, and Isingiro. By press time, 3 people had been reported dead at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital.

According to Dr Rose Muhindo, a physician at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital, in the past 2 weeks [the hospital] received 5 patients with normal medical symptoms such as headache, chest pain, diarrhea, and fever, but what struck the staff was when the patients presented with bleeding. Tests confirmed that the patients were suffering from Rift Valley fever.

Muhindo said the 1st patient who was admitted was from Isingiro. The patient [died] on arrival before any tests were carried out. Another patient was from Nakivale settlement camp in Isingiro, and the other 2 were from Ibanda and Kiruhura.

"We have lost 3 patients," Muhindo said. "One was coughing blood and died on arrival. Shortly after, we lost another one. However, we are still waiting for results to confirm what could have killed them. The good news is that we have managed to save the lives of 2 patients who will be discharged 2 days from now." Muhindo says this is a sporadic outbreak. The disease typically presents specific and hemorrhagic signs. Transmitted by mosquitoes and blood-feeding flies, the disease is caused by a virus that usually affects animals, commonly cattle and sheep, but can also attack humans.

Rift Valley fever is in the category of hemorrhagic fevers along with Marburg and Ebola. The disease ranges from a mild flu-like illness to a severe hemorrhagic fever that can be lethal among humans.

"A patient 1st presents severe headache, vomiting, and stomach pain," Muhindo said. "Later, bleeding occurs. [The disease] can occur when a person is bitten by a mosquito that fed from infected livestock or when the person eats meat from infected livestock if it's not cooked [properly]." She added that there is no human-to-human transmission of the disease, unlike with Marburg and Ebola. "Our message from the medical team to the public is they should avoid eating meat that is not well prepared. If the animals have died, they should be buried or burnt; once we go ahead and try to eat this meat, that is how we get infected."

Dr Muhindo said they have not confirmed Crimean Congo fever; however, they are still waiting for the results from Uganda Virus Research Institute Entebbe. "When we get a patient, we run many tests. [It's not appropriate to] report results that have not been confirmed. We have confirmed Rift Valley fever, not Crimean Congo fever. We are still waiting for the results from UVRI."

[Staff] have the protective gear to handle the hemorrhagic fever, Muhindo added. "We have gone ahead and trained our clinicians who receive the patients to identify patients suspected to have the fever. It's natural that people fear bleeding patients, so [once we are informed], we are ready to do our work."

Dr Barigye Celestine, the hospital director at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital, echoed [Muhinda's comments] and asked the veterinary officers to help sensitize the public on the health complications caused by eating dead livestock. Barigye also confirmed that patients with hemorrhagic fever are put in an isolation centre for treatment.

[The number of Rift Valley fever (RVF) cases has increased from 3 to 5. Of the 5 above cases, 3 may have been included in the ProMED-mail post of a [Tue 17 Jul 2018] WHO report (see: Rift Valley fever - Eastern Africa (17): Uganda 20180717.5910736). As noted earlier, although people can become infected through contact with sick animals or their tissues and secretions, RVF virus can also be transmitted by mosquitoes. An earlier report indicated that this year's [2018] heavy rainfall has resulted in widespread flooding in low-lying grasslands. Flooding and standing water enabled a higher number of mosquito eggs than usual to hatch and thus increased the potential for RVF to spread among people and animals.

The RVF virus is endemic in the Eastern Africa region and has caused repeated outbreaks in the past. It affects primarily ruminant livestock, such as cattle, sheep, goats, and camels, and also wildlife such as buffalos. In these animals, it causes abortions and deaths, resulting in significant economic loss.

The RVF virus can also affect humans. Most infections are mild, but some people fall severely ill and even die, with symptoms such as fever, weakness, and bleeding from gums and mouth. The majority of human infections result from direct or indirect contact with the blood, body fluids, or tissues of infected animals. This can happen during slaughtering or butchering, while assisting with animal births or treating the animals, and from contact with disposed carcasses or fetuses. - Mod.TY
