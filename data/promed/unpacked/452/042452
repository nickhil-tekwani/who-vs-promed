The state health secretary, Juan Guillermo Mansur Arzola, confirmed
an outbreak of haemorrhagic conjunctivitis, with 7000 cases localized
in the central region of the Mexican state of Tamaulipas.

"We had an outbreak of conjunctivitis with 7000 cases of the
hemorrhagic type, which is now under control," said Mansur. The state
secretary said they are alert, and "with the necessary measures,
conjunctivitis has no consequences, because it is a rapidly self
healing disease if lubricants are applied. There have been no
consequences," he added.

Haemorrhagic conjunctivitis is a highly contagious and epidemic viral
infection whose symptoms include redness, a burning sensation,
excessive tear production, and swelling of the eyelids.
