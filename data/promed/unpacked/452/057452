Danbury (WTNH)_ Two people in Danbury have been infected with Anthrax
contracted from animal skins.
Officials say Ase-AmenRa Kariamu contracted 'cutaneous anthrax' from
animals skins brought from Africa to make a drum. Kariamu makes and
restores drums made of animal hides.
"In most cases cutaneous anthrax, even inhalation anthrax in the
United States comes from actually handling animal hides," said Dr.
James Hadler, Connecticut Department of Public Health.
Danbury Police Captain Robert Myles told News Channel 8 a member of
the victim's family also contracted the disease from contact with the
anthrax bacteria.
In a live interview on News Channel 8 @ Noon, Mayor Mark Boughton
said it is "not possible" for anyone to catch anthrax from this man.
"This kind of anthrax is what's called 'cutaneous anthrax', it is not
known to spread from person to person," said Boughton.
Health officials say cutaneous anthrax is not contagious and can
usually be treated with antibiotics. Both people are out of the
hospital and expected to make a full recovery.
Police closed off an area located on Route 37 near the intersection
of Pembrooke and Padanaram Roads. Emergency crews at the scene are
wearing protective suits and a decontamination unit has been set up
outside the home.
The FBI says it's aware of the situation, but says it is not a case
of terrorism.
