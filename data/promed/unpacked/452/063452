Incidents of Kyasanur forest disease (KFD) have been reported from three
taluks [divisions in Uttara Kannada district during the current year
[2000 & fears have been evinced that the disease might break out in the
other sensitive districts of the Western Ghats region.
Five districts -- Shimoga, Chikmagalur, Uttara Kannada, Dakshina Kannada
and Udupi, have been identified as KFD-sensitive. The worst-affected
regions during the present summer are Honnavar, Joida and Siddapur taluks
from where 9 deaths have been reported, of which 2 have been confirmed as
cases of [KFD. 84 blood samples from all around the region, especially
from Uttara Kannada, Chikmagalur and Dakshina Kannada districts, have been
tested at the vaccine diagnostic laboratory in Shimoga, of which 21 have
been diagnosed as positive.
The only unit which produces vaccine for the disease is situated in Shimoga
city. The unit, which had stopped functioning for over two years, became
operational once again in December last [1999. Despite problems, the unit
has rushed around 7000 [doses of KFD vaccine to the affected taluks in
Uttara Kannada District.
The disease is caused by a virus which is transmitted by ticks. The first
indication of the outbreak of this disease is the death of monkeys in large
numbers. In fact, the affected monkeys will most commonly be found near
water spots as they become dehydrated because of the disease.
The virus is carried to humans through ticks and causes fever, convulsions
and, in extreme cases, bleeding from the nose and even rectum. Sometimes,
brain haemorrhage is also reported. The disease was first noticed in the
Kyasanur forest area of Sorab taluk in Shimoga district [in the 1950s. The
Western Ghats area and the adjoining districts have been identified as
sensitive regions.
