Government Worried About Underground Routes That Could Spread Bird Flu
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Fears of a global killer flu, whether likely or not, have forced local, state,
and federal officials [in the USA] to create pandemic emergency plans. The I-
Team recently obtained internal government documents that detail ... the
underground routes the virus is predicted to take to spread into North America.
One route poses a threat to Missouri and Illinois. It involves animal swap
meets, where birds and other animals are bought and sold like items at a flea
market.
We took hidden cameras into what Illinois agriculture officials call
an illegal animal swap meet at the Monroe County Fairgrounds in
Waterloo, Illinois. Experts tell the I-Team the majority of people
who buy and sell at swap meets are legitimate. But they also say swap
meets provide the perfect venue for smugglers. Parrots like majestic
macaws typically cost more than USD 1000. Legal birds come with
papers proving where they were born. Some even have microchips
implanted. Birds are the 3rd most popular pets, right behind dogs and
cats.
St. Louis veterinarian Dr. Dave Kersting treats about 10 000 birds at
his clinic. He receives calls from people daily worried about H5N1,
the avian flu. Dr. Kersting said, "the risk is more through smuggled
birds and birds coming into the country from affected parts of the
world." Dr. Kersting says birds sold at swap meets are one of his
biggest concerns.
We saw all types of birds crammed into cages, sold from the backs of
trucks, and loaded into trailers. A woman we'll call "Sherry" used to
be connected to the smuggling trade. She is now an undercover federal
informant. Sherry met us at the swap meet and says some of the
chickens end up in restaurants. Sherry went on to say, "these chicken
yard sales are in every state. It's just a matter of time before
something comes in."
In Missouri, anyone can operate a swap meet. State agriculture
officials say you don't even need a permit. That is not the case in
Illinois. According to officials with the Illinois Department of
Agriculture, organizers of the Waterloo swap meet did not have a
permit. Under the law, the spokesperson said, organizers could be
fined. At the Waterloo swap meet, we did not see any health
inspectors, any agriculture officials, or anyone else who could
determine where these birds came from. We did not see anyone who
could ascertain whether they might be sick or whether they were legal.
Last year [2004], the federal government banned the sale of exotic
birds from any country where officials detected avian influenza.
Last week, the I-Team obtained an internal US Department of Interior
briefing. The heading reads "HPAI: Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza
-- Not IF, But When." According to the report, avian flu will likely
spread into the states either through international commerce like
poultry, contaminated materials, smuggling, or the pet and wildlife
trade. The report also listed migratory birds and the potential for
human-to-human transmission. Mike Williams is the director for
communicable disease control and emergency preparedness at the St.
Louis County Health Department. At a recent pandemic planning
seminar, Williams said, "it will enter one of 2 ways, either through
migratory birds or smuggled birds. It's possible the smuggled bird
might be the earlier event."
United States Fish and Wildlife agents are trying to stop smugglers
at airports and seaports. But, they're outnumbered. There are only
120 agents trying to inspect thousands of imports a day.
The Midwest Bird and Animal Breeders Association organized the
Waterloo swap meet. The group's president told me he didn't know he
needed a permit. In the future, he said he would get one from state
authorities. He also said he would clamp down on vendors who do not
have required documents.

Alaskan villagers have key role
-------------------------------
James Active Jr. may live in one of the more remote areas of North
America, but that hasn't kept him from tracking the path of the
avian-flu virus on its march across the globe. Thousands of miles
from these outbreaks, he sounds resigned to the eventual appearance
of the disease on his turf. "We hear about it being overseas in
different countries, but somewhere down the line, I'm sure it will
end up this way too," he said. A subsistence hunter, Active depends
on birds to feed his family through the spring until salmon return to
local rivers in June. Like many others, he shrugs off his nagging
worries about the virus. He can't afford to give up hunting birds, he
said, even as a massive effort gears up to find out whether the
disease has gained entry into North America through his vast back
yard.
While no roads link Kipnuk and dozens of neighboring villages to the
rest of the world, the skies are thoroughfares for migrating
waterfowl and shorebirds. Come spring, they nest by the millions in
the surrounding delta of the mighty Yukon and Kuskokwim rivers. It's
considered the crossroads for birds migrating between Asia and North
America.
So far, the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu, found in migratory birds
in other parts of the world, has not been detected in North America.
And in an effort to make sure the virus has not arrived, the federal
government plans to spend USD 7.4 million this year [2006] to test
wild birds, focusing on the vast tundra and small isolated villages
of western Alaska.
"If all goes according to plan, we'll have tested well over 15 000
birds" in Alaska, said Deborah Rocque, avian-influenza coordinator
for the region's U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. While most birds
will be tested live, several thousand hunter-killed birds also will
be tested. That will require enlisting the help of local subsistence
hunters. They'll be asked to bring their catch to a check station
where technicians will swab the bird for a sample of fecal matter.
Even though test results won't be available for another 2 weeks to 2 months,
Active is willing to help. He and other residents of the delta's cash-poor
villages depend on the spring migration -- birds like cackling geese, king
eiders, sandhill cranes, green and blue-winged teal -- for their protein.
[Active is a] Yupik Eskimo from Kipnuk, a native village of 600 people on the
edge of the Bering Sea.

[As there is probably no way of meaningfully protecting the Inuit
before the virus arrives, if it does, they may want to bleed hunters
such as James Active at the beginning and end of the migratory season
and check for antibodies. This could be done at the check station. -
