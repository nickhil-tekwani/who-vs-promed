Taiwan Reports 1st Imported Case Of Rabies Of 2013 In Filipino Worker
-------------------------------------------------------------
A Filipino migrant worker is the 1st case of human rabies to be reported in 2013, according to an alert from the Taiwnese Centers for Disease Contol(CDC) on Sunday [12 May 2013]. A 31-year-old Filipino man apparently received a dog bite on [10 Mar 2013] and never sought out rabies prophylaxis. He arrived in Taiwan in early April [2013] and starting experiencing early symptoms of rabies last week [week of 6 May 2013].

The physician at the hospital noticed the healing dog bite on the patients fingers and the family confirmed the animal bite. The patient has been hospitalized in a quarantine ward because rabies is a category 1 notifiable communicable disease. His condition is deteriorating rapidly and he is now suffering from multiple organ failure, the centers reported.

Rabies is an acute viral infection that is transmitted to humans or other mammals usually through the saliva from a bite of an infected animal. It is also rarely contracted through breaks in the skin or contact with mucous membranes. It has been suggested that airborne transmission is possible in caves where there are heavy concentrations of bats. According to the Control of Communicable Diseases Manual, all mammals are susceptible to rabies. Raccoons, skunks, foxes, bats, dogs, coyotes and cats are the likely suspects [in the U.S.A.]. Other animals like otters and ferrets are also high risk. Mammals like rabbits, squirrels, rodents and opossums are rarely infected. Rabies infected animals can appear very aggressive, attacking for no reason. Some may act very tame. They may look like they are foaming at the mouth or drooling because they cannot swallow their saliva. Sometimes the animal may stagger (this can also be seen in [canine] distemper). Not long after this point they will die. Most animals can transmit rabies days before showing symptoms.

Initially, like in many diseases, the symptoms of rabies are non-specific; fever, headache and malaise. This may last several days. At the site of the bite, there may be some pain and discomfort. Symptoms then progress to more severe: confusion, delirium, abnormal behavior and hallucinations. If it gets this far, the disease is nearly 100 percent fatal. Worldwide it is estimated that there are more than 55 000 deaths due to rabies annually with most cases reported from Africa, Asia, including China and India, Latin America and the Middle East. The Philippines reports several hundred human rabies cases annually. Human rabies is prevented by administration of rabies vaccine and rabies immune globulin [post exposure].

[According to WHO, rabies continues to be a public health problem in the Philippines. The country is one of the top 10 countries with a rabies problem. It is responsible for the deaths of 200 to 300 Filipinos per year. In 2010, 257 died of rabies, and in 2011, 202 deaths were reported. At least 1/3 of deaths due to human rabies are among children less than 15 years old. Animal bite cases have been increasing for the past 5 years. At least 328 459 persons in 2011, and 266 220 individuals in 2010 were bitten by animals. Almost half of rabies exposures are among school children. Dogs remain the principal cause of animal bites and rabies cases (see: http://www.wpro.who.int/philippines/areas/communicable_diseases/rabies/continuation_rabies_area_page/en/index.html).

In 2009, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation through WHO, provided support to 3 countries, the Philippines included, in its program for rabies-free communities. Called "Rabies-free Visayas Islands Project", its goal is to declare the Visayas Region rabies-free zones at the end of project implementation. The project is jointly implemented by the Department of Health (DOH), as lead proponent, the Department of Agriculture (DA) and the local government units (LGUs). The main strategy is prevention of human rabies through the control and elimination of canine rabies. Activities include mass dog vaccinations, consultative meetings and planning workshops, advocacy meetings with LGUs, strengthening of rabies diagnostic laboratories, providing additional vaccines for post-exposure prophylaxis of animal bite patients, as well as promoting responsible pet ownership and surveillance.

The preceding report from Taiwan does not state the region of the Philippines where the migrant worker contracted the infection. - Mod.CP]

In the prior report of an imported case of rabies in Taiwan in 2012 (imported from China - see prior ProMED-mail report below), The following comment was excerpted from Mod.CP's comment: "Angela Song-En Huang added a comment that Taiwan had had no reported human rabies cases since 1959, and no animal rabies since 1961. Taiwan is one of the few rabies-free areas in the world. Citizens bitten by animals in Taiwan do not need to receive rabies immunoglobulin or vaccine. The last case of imported human rabies in Taiwan occurred in 2002. The patient was infected in China, and became ill while visiting relatives in Hualien [see ProMED ref. below]." - Mod.MPP]
