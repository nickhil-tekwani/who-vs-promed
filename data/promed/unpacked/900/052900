Anthrax back in mountain areas
------------------------------
Around 40 people were confirmed to have come in contact with anthrax,
a disease commonly spread by animals, over the past 2 months in Tuan
Giao [Dien Bien province] and Than Uyen [Lai Chau province] districts
of the northern mountainous provinces of Dien Bien and Lai Chau. One
40-year-old slaughterer from Than Uyen District was taken to the local
health centre after slaughtering a buffalo suspected to be infected
with anthrax. He died one day later.

His symptoms included a skin infection of small, raised bumps that
itched like insect or spider bites and subsequently developed into
fluid-filled blisters. The blisters had black centres of tissue
(eschar) with surrounding redness and swelling. [Excellent
description. - Mod.MHJ]

Nguyen Cong Huan, director of the Lai Chau Province's Health
Department said Than Uyen District has been known as an anthrax
epidemic area in previous years. Apart from Lai Chau and Dien Bien
provinces, Thanh Hoa and Ha Giang provinces once reported cases of
anthrax, according to the Ha Noi-based National Hospital of Tropical
Diseases.

To stop the spread of the epidemic, the department sent authorised
teams to spray chemicals and inform local residents of prevention
methods, Huan said. "It is hard to destroy the bacterium. Because it
must be buried under ground, it takes tens of years to destroy," he
[Nguyen Cong Huan] said.

The hospital's deputy head of Emergency Department, Nguyen Trung Cap,
said that it is difficult to eradicate the disease in Viet Nam due to
its tropical monsoon climate. Negligence of authorised agencies and
local residents' lack of knowledge of the dangers of anthrax pose the
potential risk of re-outbreak, Cap said. People can die in less than 3
days if they do not receive prompt treatments, he said. Cap said that
anthrax can be spread in 3 ways: skin contact with anthrax spores,
such as from infected animals or animal products including hair, wool,
or hides; inhaling anthrax spores; and eating contaminated,
undercooked meat.

People are advised to quickly go to the nearest health centre if
finding any symptoms of the anthrax.

[This report amply demonstrates the failure in northern Viet Nam to
challenge this livestock disease that is readily controlled by
providing annual vaccination with the Sterne vaccine. This is possibly
the cheapest vaccine in the world (about US 40 cents/dose); is
reasonably robust -- just don't put it on the dashboard of your pickup
while travelling out to the farms to be visited, best transported in a
chiller; and gives 6-9 months protection within 8 days of being
injected. And for these monsoon areas do the vaccination before the
monsoon rains start, when the roads are safe to drive. And though they
claim this disease is sporadic, with some 40 people affected, there
have probably been a significant number of livestock down with the
disease. Not every one of which will have been butchered for human
consumption resulting in these 40 possible cases.

Lai Chau and Dien Bien provinces are located in the northwest region
of Viet Nam. Maps of the country can be seen at
