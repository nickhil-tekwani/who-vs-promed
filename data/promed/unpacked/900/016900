I find these reports interesting and alarming. As a dermatologist, I see
children with uncomplicated hand, foot, and mouth disease frequently during
the summer months. I rarely consider viral typing. I practice in a
community with a large immigrant population, many of whom are recent
immigrants.
Should I consider viral typing for patients who present with uncomplicated
hand, foot, and mouth disease as a surveillance measure? If so, what is
the appropriate collection method, and to whom should the samples be sent?

I am a Paediatrician working on a public health project, based here in
Hanoi, Viet Nam. At present I believe I am the only expatriate
paediatrician doing any clinical work here, and I am often asked to see the
children of other foreign residents. I also have young children of my own.
I have been reading the items on this epidemic with great interest and a
little nervousness as we are so close to Taiwan and the numbers are so high
that it seems inevitable that we will see cases here.
None of the postings have given much clinical information about how the
majority of cases (the non-fatal ones) have been presenting, or how those
who died looked early in their illness. This month I have seen 2 children
(siblings) who presented with oral ulcers, high fever and diarrhoea 10 days
after a trip to Hong Kong. One was quite sick - pale and lethargic but
normotensive, before improving spontaneously, and I am
wondering if they brought this illness with them from Hong Kong. There
have also been cases of classical hand, foot and mouth disease in late April.
I would appreciate any Taiwanese clinician subscribers to ProMED-mail
posting a description of the typical clinical presentation of the cases
they have seen, any danger signs common to those who deteriorated,
incubation period for disease in contacts of those who were sick
previously, natural history of illness in those in whom the illness
resolved etc. I would have thought that with 300 000 cases, 30 (or 38)
deaths and supposedly a single aetiological agent a pattern would be emerging.

Having had a small hand in the epidemic in Malaysia (managed some of the
children in Sarawak that died), I would be grateful if the Taiwan
paediatricians could share with us what their therapeutic options are
currently. Are they having any success? We saw very few children whom we
thought we had salvaged.
During the height of our epidemic the following were considered useful:
1. IV gamma globulin (1-2 g/kg) single dose
2. High dose inotropes
3. Very close clinical and HR monitoring using electronic means (although
this only told us who was at risk of dying but not what to do)
4. Conventional intensive care support
IV acyclovir was tried, for what it is worth, but was mainly motivated by
frustration at not being able to do much.
Some tried high dose steroids but generally we felt they were not useful.
We want to learn from the Taiwan epidemic to prepare for any further cases.
Our prayers with your children & families.
