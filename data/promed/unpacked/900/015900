Rabid raccoon prompts rabies alert for Middleburg
-------------------------------------------------
The Clay County Health Department issued a rabies alert today [24 Sep 2010]
for the Middleburg 32068 zip code, south of County Road 218 to Florida 16.
The alert was in response to a raccoon that recently tested positive for
rabies, according to a news release. A pet was exposed to the raccoon, but
no humans.

"Rabies among wild animals ... continues to be a concern as this is the 2nd
rabies alert issued for this area of Clay County in 2010. The previous
alert was issued in February," according to the release. "Residents and
visitors in Clay County should be aware that rabies is present in the wild
animal population and domestic animals are at risk if not vaccinated.

"The public is asked to maintain a heightened awareness that rabies is
active in Clay County. Alerts are designed to increase awareness to the
public. This alert should not give a false sense of security to areas that
have not been named as under this alert." The alert is for 60 days.

All domestic animals should be vaccinated against rabies and all wildlife
contact should be avoided, particularly raccoons, bats, foxes, skunks,
otters, bobcats, and coyotes.

Rabies is a disease of the nervous system and is fatal to warm blooded
animals and humans. The only treatment for human exposure to rabies is
rabies specific immune globulin and rabies immunization. Appropriate
treatment started soon after the exposure, will protect an exposed person
from the disease.

The Health Department advised:
- all pets should have current rabies immunizations;
- secure outside garbage in covered containers to avoid attracting wild
animals;
- do not leave pet food outside. This also attracts other animals;
- for questions regarding the health of an animal, contact a veterinarian;
- veterinarian staff and animal control staff should be alert for animals
encountered with signs suspicious for rabies and use appropriate
precautions, especially when working with unvaccinated animals;
- persons who have been bitten or scratched by wild or domestic animals
should seek medical attention and report the injury to the Clay County
Animal Control;
- rabies is preventable when treatment is provided in a timely manner;
- avoid contact with all wildlife, especially raccoons, bats, and foxes;
- no animal is too young to have rabies;
- for general questions pertaining to animals, contact the Clay County
Animal Control.

Old Orchard Beach raccoon is state's 48th rabies case
-----------------------------------------------------
A rabid raccoon that tangled with a dog in Old Orchard Beach Tuesday [21
Sep 2010] is the 48th animal to test positive for the fatal disease this
year. The dog in Old Orchard Beach was up to date on its shots but has been
quarantined as a precaution, Sears said.

The Maine centers for Disease Control reports that rabies cases have
remained fairly steady in recent years, with raccoons being the most common
carriers the disease when it comes in contact with humans or pets.

The state will join in efforts around the globe to raise awareness about
rabies with an observance of World Rabies Day next Tuesday [28 Sep 2010].
State health officials and the warden's service will hold a news conference
Tuesday at the State House.

"The message we would really like to impress on folks is to avoid wild
animals," said Dr Stephen Sears, state epidemiologist. Anyone who does have
contact with a wild animal behaving strangely, such as a nocturnal animal
out during the daytime, should seek medical attention, he said.

Sears said that 23 of the positives tests this year [2010] have been
raccoons. Besides raccoons, other animals that are commonly infected with
rabies are skunk, fox and bats.

Skunk is Cumberland County's 8th rabies case for year
-----------------------------------------------------
Cumberland County has reported its 8th positive rabies case this year [2010].

On 12 Sep 2010, a rabid skunk was found dead in the Upper Deerfield area.
Before the time of death, the skunk was out during daylight hours and
appeared sick. Signs included a wobbly gait and drooling.

The skunk was not afraid of humans or domestic animals. Stray cats may have
been bitten by or exposed to the skunk. It is unknown whether humans were
exposed to the rabid skunk.

Rabies is a fatal disease that can affect humans and animals. The rabies
virus is passed in the saliva of an infected animal to an uninfected animal
or human when bitten. To prevent the spread of rabies, keep rabies
vaccinations up-to-date for pets. Maintain control of your pets by keeping
cats indoors and keeping dogs under direct supervision. Call animal control
to remove any stray animals from your neighborhood, since these animals may
not be vaccinated or may have rabies.

Pet owners on alert for rabies in North Jersey
----------------------------------------------
Fair Lawn's health officer is sounding the alarm. Carol Wagner says it is
unusual to have a cluster of rabies cases here. As a precaution, a young
boy is getting shots after camping in his backyard.

"He was sleeping outside and a raccoon ambled into his area, but he was
asleep, so he did not know it, and he woke up to find a raccoon, kind of,
scratching at his leg," Wagner told WCBS 880 reporter Sean Adams. It's not
known if that raccoon is rabid.

Wagner says look for lethargic, disoriented, and aggressive animals. Keep
pets under close watch. If one is bitten, even it has been inoculated, get
a rabies booster.

Alert given for rabid kitten
----------------------------
Pauls Valley officials are still pushing to get the word out to any local
residents who might have come in contact with a rabid kitten earlier this
month [September 2010]. The kitten was dropped this past weekend [18-19 Sep
2010] at the outside gate to the Pauls Valley Animal Shelter. Now local and
state public health officials are asking anyone who may have come in
contact with the kitten to report it for their own safety.

Pauls Valley Police chief Mitch McGill said the young cat was left at the
local shelter late Saturday night or early Sunday morning. "We're trying to
determine who dumped off the cat at the shelter. We want to get the word
out to the public that we would like to know where the cat came from so we
can determine if anyone else was exposed," he said.

The animal was described as a male, short-haired Tabby kitten about 4
months old or less with orange fur and lighter stripes of orange. The
kitten, which did have the rabies virus, died a short time later but not
before an animal shelter worker was exposed with a nick on the finger.
McGill said the worker is doing fine since employees at the shelter
commonly take preventative immunizations anyway. The only treatment for the
worker was a booster shot after the incident, he said.

Anyone who thinks they might have been exposed to the kitten from 9-19 Sep
2010 should contact the OSDH [Oklahoma State Department of Health]
Epidemiologist-on-Call at 405-271-4060 or 800-234-5963 on a 24-hour basis
to determine if they need to receive treatment to prevent rabies. Persons
who were bitten by the kitten or had saliva get into a cut or fresh wound
on the skin or mucous membranes (eyes, lining of the nose, or mouth) may
have been exposed to the rabies virus.

So far this year [2010] in Oklahoma there have been a total of 48 cases of
animal rabies, including 3 cats.

Chemung County Health Department offering free rabies vaccination clinics
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early this summer [2010], 2 adult members of a Chemung County family were
bitten by their pet cat that, unknown to them, was infected with the rabies
virus.

The adults and 2 small children who had close contact with the cat had to
undergo rabies treatment: a series of shots administered over a 2 week period.

The incident, county health officials say, is an unfortunate reminder that
rabies in household pets can still present a health threat to the pets' owners.

While animals in the wild can contract rabies, pets typically serve as a
buffer between those animals and humans, but only if the pets are
vaccinated, said Cassandra Hotchkiss of the Chemung County Health Department.

And to that end, the department is offering free rabies vaccination clinics
this month [September 2010] and next. According to the New York State
Health Department, 26 cats, foxes, bats, and raccoons in Chemung County
were tested for rabies in August [2010], with 3 of the tests coming back
positive.

Rabid bats found in Mohave County
---------------------------------
Rabies has been confirmed in an animal found in Mohave County for the 1st
time since 2007.

County officials say testing on 2 bats that came in contact with people
showed they were infected with the fatal disease.

One bat was found in Fort Mojave in late July [2010] after it came into
contact with a child. The 2nd bat was found on Lake Mohave about 3 weeks
ago, where another child had contact with the animal.

Both people underwent precautionary treatment. [This probably refers to
post exposure prophylaxis. - Mod.TG]

The good news is that more communities are having rabies vaccination
clinics or drives and a push for public education regarding building the
barrier between wildlife, pets, and people as a means of protecting the
public. These public awareness campaigns are including some issues of
animal behavior that may alert a person to behavior that can be
characteristic of rabies. - Mod.TG]
