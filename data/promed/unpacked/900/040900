Pakistan reported new bird flu cases on Monday [9 Apr 2007] in
commercial poultry farms in the southern province of Sindh and in
North West Frontier Province, a government official said.
"Two to 3 days back, we found traces of H5N1 virus in small poultry
farms in Sindh and NWFP," Mohammad Afzal, Commissioner for Livestock
at the Ministry of Food and Agriculture, told Reuters. "We have
culled all the birds at these farms and disinfected the area."
He said some 300 to 350 birds had been culled at one farm but did not
say how many H5N1 cases of bird flu had been discovered.
Several outbreaks have been detected in chickens in small poultry
farms this year [2007] in Pakistan, and birds have been culled.
Authorities temporarily shut Islamabad Zoo in February 2007 after 4
peacocks and a goose died of the H5N1 strain. Pakistan has had no
human cases of the virus.
Afzal said quarantine and vaccination measures were also being used
in and around the affected farms.
Pakistan 1st detected the H5N1 strain of the virus in February 2006
in North West Frontier Province and ordered about 40 000 birds culled.

[The 2nd posting provides a very brief description of another H5N1
event. Indonesia sources continue to report a spate of human deaths,
5 last month and 2 so far this April 2007. For this reason, any
information on avian outbreaks is important, as they are the source
of risk for humans. For a map of Jembrana, Bali, see
<http://www.maplandia.com/indonesia/bali/jembrana/>.
Unfortunately, the outbreaks are occurring a great distances from
each other, as the Sindh is in the extreme southeast, and, as the
name implies, the Northwestern Frontier Province is at the other
extreme part of the country. For a map of the outbreak area in Sindh
and NWFP, see <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Pakistan_Div.png>. - Mod.PC]
