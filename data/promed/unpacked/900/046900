On 17 Feb 2010, the Ministry of Health (MoH) in Cameroon reported 3 cases
of yellow fever in Banjoun and Fantun districts of the country's Western
Region.

The index case was identified in a 28 year old man from Bandrrefan village
in Bandjoun district, who presented with a clinical picture of fever,
jaundice and abdominal pain at the end of December 2009. He had no history
of yellow fever vaccination and died on 7 Jan 2010, 3 days after his
medical consultation. During the same period, a 2nd case was reported in a
19 year old male from the same village, who died on 23 Jan 2010, 3 days
after he consulted the district hospital.

The 2 cases were identified through routine yellow fever surveillance.
Specimens from both cases were confirmed by laboratory tests from the
Pasteur Centre of Cameroun and the Regional reference laboratory for Yellow
Fever at Institut Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal.

Following identification of the 2 cases, an outbreak investigation was
conducted in December 2009 in Fombat district, neighbouring Banjoun
district. The investigation identified a 3rd case in a 40 year old man who
died in October 2009. The case was later laboratory confirmed as yellow
fever. Serum samples were taken from 77 "contact persons" of this case, all
of which tested negative for yellow fever [antibodies].

Cameroon conducted a yellow fever mass vaccination campaign in 62 at-risk
districts covering a population of 7.4 million in May 2009. The 2 districts
of Banjoun and Fantun were, however, not part of the campaign earlier
because they did not have any cases of yellow fever when the vaccination
campaign took place in May 2009.

The Ministry of Health plans to vaccinate 254 355 people in Banjoun and
Fantun districts. The country has requested support from the International
Coordinating Group on Yellow Fever Vaccine Provision (YF-ICG), which
manages the global emergency stockpile of yellow fever vaccine. The ICG has
approved support for the vaccination campaign, which will be financed by
the GAVI Alliance through the World Health Organization.

[Yellow fever (YF) has occurred sporadically in West Africa over the past 3
years. YF cases were reported in Cameroon in a ProMED-mail post on 1 Oct
2009, but in a different part of the country (Southwest region). The West
region had a population of 1 339 791 in 1987 and is undoubtedly much larger
now.
