The use of Hendra virus vaccine will not be made mandatory in Queensland, and organisers of equestrian events will have the discretion to make their own decisions around conditions of entry.

Agriculture minister Bill Byrne said the final response, tabled in parliament today [21 Apr 2017], supported most of the recommendations made in the Agriculture and Environment committee's report on the Hendra virus vaccine and its use by veterinary surgeons.

Mr Byrne said it was the responsibility of all parties in Hendra cases to provide and adhere to the correct duty of care for everyone involved, including veterinarians, creating a safe workspace.

"As such, we will not be proceeding with a recommendation to amend workplace health and safety regulations regarding veterinarians treating suspected cases of the Hendra virus," Mr. Byrne said.

"The Office of Industrial Relations had rejected the recommendation as not having sufficient regard for the accepted precedents of the statutory duty of care.

"I have been advised Workplace Health and Safety Queensland will be working with industry to review its guidance materials for veterinarians and other horse care professions on how to fulfill their workplace health and safety responsibilities."

"We want to make sure everyone involved in dealing with the Hendra virus is protected, and to do this it is necessary to follow the best biosecurity practises available."

Mr Byrne said the use of the Hendra vaccine was the single most effective way of reducing the risk of Hendra virus infection in horses.

"The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries will continue to work closely with the Queensland horse industry to promote good biosecurity practices to reduce the risk of Hendra virus infection of horses," Mr Byrne said.

"Biosecurity Queensland has agreed to revise the guidelines for treatment of horses to include information on how to manage risks.

"We will also improve information on how to report adverse reactions to vaccines and chemicals to vets and horse owners."

Mr Byrne said while the government supported new technologies, the expert advice was that technology for a rapid stall side test was not as yet advanced to assure safety and accuracy.

"In addition, we will not be including stakeholders on the technical expert working group because their work is highly technical and based on complex scientific documents," he said.

"Rather we will engage with stakeholders through the Horse Biosecurity and Market Access Liaison Group, which is a more suitable forum to engage the equine industry."

Mr Byrne said the recommendation to investigate the feasibility of a Hendra virus exclusion test capability in Townsville or Cairns was not financially feasible.

[While vaccination is the single most effective way to protect the horse, the vaccine has met with some resistance. Resistance reasons include cost of the vaccine and regulations.

The vaccine is administered via intramuscular injection into the side of the neck. Two 1 ml doses must be given between 21 and 42 days apart to complete the course. This is a legal requirement and is based on clinical trials to date.

Periodic boosters will then be administered. Currently, these doses will be required at 6 monthly intervals.

It is a requirement that all vaccinated horses are microchipped to ensure correct identification on the vaccine registry.

Equivac HeV can only be administered by accredited veterinarians, a condition of the Government's regulatory body that registers veterinary medications (APVMA) that has allowed the vaccine to come to market under a special permit. This will ensure that the vaccine is handled and stored correctly, that only healthy horses are vaccinated, and that the requirements of the registry are upheld. Due to the public health implications of this vaccine and the importance of maintaining the registry, Equivac HeV is unlikely to become available to non-veterinarians in the future [extracted from: http://www.ava.com.au/sites/default/files/Hendra%20FAQ%20brochure%20NO%20PRINTERS%20MARKS.pdf].

This does seem like it could add up. While keeping it in veterinarians' hands is important, as is protecting the animal, the cost of the vaccine, the farm call, the microchip, and a repeat of all of this less the micro chipping every 6 months could be quite burdensome. While Zoetis, the vaccine manufacturer, is in testing to see whether the protection will last longer than 6 months, that information has not been released yet.

A recent questionnaire circulated among horse owners revealed that these were some of the reasons that vaccination was lagging. They said if the vaccine was cheaper or allowed to be given by the owner or if the expense was not every 6 months or some combination, then some owners reported they may be more likely to vaccinate. Apparently, the regulations are holding back some horse owners. This article is likely a response from the government related to the recent survey questionnaire.

Certainly, it is the hope that no horses, their owners, or other pets or people become infected with Hendra virus. - Mod.TG
