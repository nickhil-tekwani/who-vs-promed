Animal anthrax: surveillance and vaccination extended in Savoie
---------------------------------------------------------------
Two new suspected anthrax cases in animals have been reported in the
communes of Villard-Sallet and La Table (Savoie) and are in the process of
being confirmed, said the prefecture of Savoie in a statement released on
Friday [7 Aug 2009]. In addition 2 new suspected anthrax cases have been
reported in cattle in the commune of La Chapelle-du-Bard (Isere), bordering
the area currently infected in the department of Savoie.

On [Fri 7 Aug 2009], outbreaks of anthrax were confirmed in 8 farms -- 6
cattle farms and 2 horse holdings -- in Savoie, in the communities of
Etable, La Table, La Trinite, and Presle. The sick animals are being
treated with antibiotics. Vaccination is now being implemented in the
suspected and confirmed outbreak locations as well as in all ruminant farms
located within a radius of 17 municipalities. By order of the prefecture of
7 Aug 2009, 6 communes in Savoie and a commune in Isere were added to the
previous list.

Health measures of disinfection, clinical monitoring, and restriction of
the movement of animals, as well as vaccination against anthrax, of all
bovines, sheep, and goats, established on the premises or imported, in the
communes of Arvillard, Champlaurent, Detrier, Etable, La Chapelle Blanche,
La Croix de la Rochette, La Rochette, La Table, La Trinite, Le Bourget en
Huile, Le Pontet, Le Verneil, Presle, Rotherens, Villard Leger, and
Villard-Sallet are mandatory. The same measures are applied in the commune
of Chapelle du Bard, in Isere. The Departmental Directorates for Health and
Social Affairs (DDASS) of Savoie and Isere are being informed of all
suspected cases and are conducting a census of all persons who could have
been exposed so that appropriate medical care can be undertaken. No human
cases have been found to date.

[This is getting complicated. On Wed 5 Aug 2009, anthrax was reported in 11
farms in the commune of La Rochette (Savoie). It has now spread to the
communes of Etable, La Table, Le Trinite, and Presle (Savoie), and is
suspected in the communes of Villard-Sallet (Savoie) and La
Chapelle-du-Bard (Isere).

It strikes me that this is a classic horse-fly based epidemic fostered by
the rains. The only puzzle then is that such events usually follow from a
significant number of animals infected in the primary outbreak, say 3 to 6,
sufficient to load up the mouthparts of the feeding haemophagic flies and
be spread by them to neighbouring herds and communes.

So far, the information on this epidemic is limited and confusing. Frankly
it is more characteristic of information generated by diagnostic
laboratories where one sample equals "one case" irrespective of the reality
on the farm that generated this singular sample, and can already have a
number of dead stock. Clarification would be appreciated. - Mod.MHJ
