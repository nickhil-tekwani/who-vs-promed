[Deleted expletive! One new case reported in Greater Glasgow and
Clyde. This is 20 days since the last report. This moderator had been
hoping that this epidemic was over. It has lasted quite long enough,
and it was time to expect to be reading an authoritative HPS report
explaining everything. Not to be for the moment. Obviously with
heroin based epidemics it lasts until the contaminated batch is
finally used up and not a grain wasted. - Mod.MHJ]
