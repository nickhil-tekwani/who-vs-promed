[Professor John has kindly provided this update on the suspected hantavirus
fatal cases in Gujarat, India. Hantaviruses were ruled out and a
laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of leptospirosis has been made. - Mod.TY]

Surat city in Gujarat had heavy rains and floods recently. Following the
floods, several cases of acute pneumonia syndrome were reported, mostly in
adults. Two differential diagnoses were suggested by local physicians and
picked up by the press: pneumonic plague and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.
As far as I know, the diagnosis of hantavirus disease, as reported in the
media, was only conjecture and not based on laboratory evidence. A 3rd
diagnosis, namely the pulmonary form of leptospirosis, has now been
laboratory confirmed.
As reported in the Hindu, Chennai edition, 26 Aug 2006, the National
Institute of Communicable Diseases in New Delhi had investigated cases in
Surat. According to Dr Sohan Lal, deputy director of NICD, the illness of 8
patients who died during the last 3 days has been serologically confirmed
as leptospirosis. Of the 30 patients still in the hospitals, 17 had also
tested positive for leptospirosis. These results were given out during a
press conference by Gujarat State health secretary Amarjit Singh, in the
presence of Dr Sohan Lal. They reported that "all tests on human and rodent
samples for plague or Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome had been negative."
The pulmonary form of leptospirosis is a haemorrhagic pneumonia resembling
pneumonic plague and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. This disease entity has
been recognised and confirmed only since 1993 and many physicians are not
yet familiar with it. (1,2)

the very first hantavirus was caught, is just beyond the northern wall of
the Christian Medical College Hospital in Vellore.

No hantavirus in Surat: report
------------------------------
Ahmedabad, Aug 29 (IANS): The National Institute of Virology in Pune
declared on Tuesday that there is no hantavirus in the flood ravaged city
of Surat, 250 km from here in south Gujarat. Additional director of NIV, M
S Chaddha said: "NIV collected 46 blood samples from Surat city, and not
even a single sample contained hantavirus."
The medical authorities in Surat, including NIV, have not yet clarified why
2 people (aged 24 and 36) had died last week. The deaths were feared to
have been caused by hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.
Meanwhile, 17 others have lost their lives due to leptospirosis during the
past 15 days, after the floodwater receded. Sixty-six cases of
leptospirosis have been reported in government hospitals hitherto in Surat.
