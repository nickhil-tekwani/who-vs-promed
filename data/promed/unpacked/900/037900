FERAL CAT CONTROL (3)
======================

I am the Preventive Medicine Technician here at a Northern California
Coast Guard Installation. We are surronded by land with a deer, bird,
Quail, duck population. Along with Squirrel(sp) and moles etc. There
has been a moderate feral cat population on this base for some time
and rabies between the cats and skunks have been a concern. There has
been also a few occasions when man and cat came in contact and bite's
or claw wounds happened. The rule was to catch and turn over the
feral cats to the county for disposal. THEN some people on the base
felt this cruel and turned policy around to a local catch, vaccinate
and spay group who was to also feed them.
In my personal view only.
This has had no effect on them continuing to hunt, kill, eat local game
or continue to scavange the open trash bins of houses or the galley.
What I do find as novel is that while the county disposed of them for
free, we pay for the other.
