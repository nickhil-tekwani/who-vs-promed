Investigation of Transfusion Recipients with West Nile Virus Infections
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
An investigation conducted by CDC, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA),
the American Red Cross, and state health departments in Georgia and Florida
has confirmed transmission of West Nile virus (WNV) from a single organ
donor to 4 organ recipients (ref. 1). During treatment for injuries that
eventually proved fatal, the organ donor received numerous transfusions of
blood products. However, the source of the organ donor's infection remains
unknown.
Subsequently, CDC has been informed of 4 other patients with WNV infection
diagnosed after receiving units of blood in the weeks before WNV diagnosis.
Because each of these patients resided in areas with high levels of WNV
activity, the most likely mode of infection is mosquito exposure. To rule
out blood transfusion-associated transmission, investigations are ongoing
and efforts are under way to contact donors of blood given to these
patients and other recipients of blood from these donors for follow-up and
WNV testing. In each instance, precautionary measures have included a
withdrawal of any remaining blood products obtained from the donors whose
blood was given to these patients.
The investigations of the organ donor and 4 other transfusion recipient
patients involve follow-up of approximately 100 donors. Initial testing by
a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay (registered trademark
TaqMan) of stored blood specimens obtained from the blood donors at the
time of donation has been completed for 2 investigations. In one
investigation, both donors tested negative for WNV. In the second
investigation, in which specimens for 15 of 17 donors were available,
specimens from 3 donors had evidence of WNV viral RNA, suggesting that
these donors might have had WNV infection at the time of donation. In
addition, plasma derived from a donation by one of these 3 donors also had
evidence of WNV RNA. These results are preliminary because all of the
specimens available for testing in both investigations were initially
processed and stored as part of routine blood collection procedures, which
could affect test validity. Therefore, additional follow-up testing and
epidemiologic investigation of these donors are necessary.
In cases of suspected WNV meningitis or encephalitis in recent (e.g., <4
weeks before onset of illness) recipients of blood or organs, clinicians
should contact local public health authorities to initiate an
investigation. Serum or tissue samples should be retained for later studies.
