An additional 5 patients were confirmed with MERS-CoV infection

- Three patients had contact with the index patient's hospital B

- The remaining 2 patients had been admitted to the same hospital ward as patient 16 in hospital E

[unclear machine translation here but seems to say there are 14 confirmed individuals who had contact with health professionals that worked in the medical institutions where MERS-CoV infected patients were admitted.]
 
The Department of Health and Human Services' central management task force announced on Thurs 4 Jun 2015 there 5 additional cases were confirmed as positive for MERS-CoV infection.
 
Of the 3 patients that were admitted to hospital B, all 3 were in medical wards during the period 15-17 May 2015 when the index case was admitted there.

Of the other 2 patients, one was in the same ward in hospital E 28-30 May 2015 while case no.16 was hospitalized there, and the other a physician who had contact with case no.14 at hospital D on 27 May 2015 and had a fever.

[In the latest report of the MOH for 4 Jun 2015 (due to time zone change it is now AM of 4 Jun 2015 in S. Korea), there were an additional 5 cases confirmed with MERS-CoV infection in South Korea bringing the total number of cases reported in South Koreans to 35. Three of the 5 cases are secondary cases, having been in hospital B at the same time the index case was admitted there, and two of the cases a)re tertiary cases, having had contact with secondary cases (case no.14 while admitted to hospital D and case no.16 in hospital E. Of the 5 newly confirmed cases, 2 were healthcare personnel (a media report submitted by ProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iikura classified them as physicians http://www.arirang.co.kr/News/News_View.asp?nseq=180199). There have now been 5 tertiary cases reported.

An additional 5 [MERS] patients have been confirmed, bringing the total number of Korean cases to 30 including 2 deaths.

Of the 5 newly confirmed cases [today, 3 Jun 2015]:
- 4 patients are secondary cases associated with spread in the 2nd hospital [hospital B] where the index case was admitted, involving medical patients or family members, all of whom had contact with the 1st patient (the index case) (or in the same ward as the index case).
- One patient is a tertiary case associated with contact with case No. 16 .

Of these 4 patients referred to above as secondary cases, all were at the hospital between 15 and 17 May 2015, either hospitalized or visiting a family member who was hospitalized in the same ward as the index case.

The other 1 patient was in the hospital from 22- 28 May 2015 in the same ward as one of the secondary cases (case No.16). [Hence, it is referred to as a tertiary case.]

Summary and risk assessment of current situation in Republic of Korea and China
-------------------------
MERS-CoV risk assessment 3 Jun 2015

Background
As of [3 Jun 2015], 1179 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have been reported to WHO since 2012, including at least 442 deaths. Overall, 66 percent of cases reporting gender (n=1165) are male and the median age is 49 years (range 9 months-99 years; n=1172).

To date, 25 countries have reported cases, including countries in the Middle East [Map showing locations of confirmed cases as of 2 Jun 2015 can be found in Figure 1 (Number of laboratory confirmed cases MERS-CoV cases reported by countries as of 3 Jun 2015), available at http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/mers_global_20150602vers2.jpg?ua=1]: Egypt, Iran, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia (KSA), United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Yemen; in Africa: Algeria, and Tunisia; in Europe: Austria, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Turkey and the United Kingdom; in Asia: China, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia and Philippines; and in North America: the United States of America (USA). The majority of cases (greater than 85 percent) have been reported from KSA. Since May 2015 2 new countries have been affected (China and Republic of Korea).

On 20 May [2015], one case was reported from Republic of Korea. This case had recently travelled to KSA, Qatar, UAE and Bahrain. The person was not ill during this period of travel. Contact tracing in Republic of Korea is ongoing and thus far has identified an additional 29 laboratory confirmed cases, 2 of whom died [note that the 30th case included in the South Korean MOH is the case that was imported into China and is counted separately by WHO. Also note that there are now 35 confirmed cases as of 4 Jun 2015 in South Korea. - Mod.MPP]. These include health care workers caring for the patient, patients who were being cared for at the same health care facilities and family members. There is evidence of limited tertiary transmission (n=3) [a 4th and 5th tertiary case were reported for 4 Jun 2015, information available after this assessment was published, see section [1] above. - Mod.MPP] among the cases. WHO is in close contact with Republic of Korea, which has been actively providing information on the situation to WHO. This is the largest outbreak of MERS-CoV outside the Middle East. Since the identification of the 1st laboratory confirmed case, aggressive contact tracing has been in place and as of [3 Jun 2015], 1369 contacts are being followed and are in quarantine or isolation either at home or in state run facilities.

One of the cases whose exposure was in Republic of Korea, travelled to Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region, China by plane and then to Guangdong, China by bus [This case is reported by South Korea on the MOH summary statement above]. The case was symptomatic while traveling. Chinese authorities have placed this person in isolation and have identified contacts in Hong Kong and China. The contacts are in quarantine and are being followed and tested for MERS-CoV. This is the 1st MERS-CoV case reported in China.

WHO is continuing to work closely with Korean and Chinese health authorities and international technical organizations to control this outbreak, ensure proper treatment of ill persons, prevent further cases and gain a better understanding of transmission patterns and risk factors in this outbreak.

Risk assessment
The ongoing outbreak in Republic of Korea started from a single person who travelled to the Middle East (KSA, Qatar, UAE and Bahrain). WHO is in contact with health authorities in these countries to investigate the potential source of exposure(s). In Republic of Korea, the index case appears to have transmitted infection to close relatives, patients with whom he shared a room/ward and health care workers providing care. These exposures happened before MERS-CoV was suspected or diagnosed. Nosocomial and home-based transmission have been previously observed (e.g., in KSA, UAE, France, United Kingdom). This is the largest nosocomial outbreak that has occurred outside of the Middle East. This is also the 1st time MERS-CoV has been exported to Republic of Korea or China. The individual who travelled to China was symptomatic.

In this outbreak, all known transmission of this virus have occurred before adequate infection prevention and control procedures were applied and reflects transmission patterns seen in previous nosocomial outbreaks in the Middle East. Monitoring of the situation and contacts is ongoing and more information is being gathered to better assess the risks associated with this particular event. Sequencing of the viruses obtained from patients in Republic of Korea and China is ongoing.

MERS-CoV is considered a zoonotic virus that can lead to secondary infections among people. Most infections have occurred in the Middle East and among them, many community-acquired infections are thought to be associated with direct or indirect contact with infected dromedary camels or camel-related products. Infection acquired by exposure to camels represent a minority of all cases. Once a persons is infected by MERS-CoV and is symptomatic, the person can transmit infection to others, but the specific modes of transmission, risk factors and conditions facilitating transmission are not well established. In no location has community wide transmission been observed. While human-to-human transmission has been observed in households in affected countries, most human cases reported to date have resulted from human-to-human transmission in health care settings. Suboptimal infection prevention and control in health care settings have sometimes resulted in large numbers of secondary cases, as was seen in KSA in April-May of 2014.

WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection may be reported from Republic of Korea among the persons who were in contact with initial cases before measures were implemented by the public health authorities. Consistent application of adequate infection and prevention and public health measures has stopped transmission in previous clusters.

Recommendations
Enhancing infection prevention and control awareness and implementation measures is critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in healthcare facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early and for this reason, all health care facilities should have standard infection prevention and control practices in place for infectious diseases in general. If MERS-CoV is suspected, policies and procedure for rapid screening and assessment of potential MERS-CoV cases should be in place to ensure rapid care of the patient and to minimize the number of contacts among other patients, visitors and health workers. Droplet precautions, including eye protection, should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to any patient with symptoms of acute respiratory infection.

Other measures involve linen management, cleaning and disinfection and waste management. Airborne precautions are not generally recommended except when performing aerosol-generating procedures.

Health workers and facilities in all countries should maintain a high level of vigilance for the possibility of MERS-CoV especially among travellers or migrant workers returning from the Middle East. Countries should ensure adequate surveillance for MERS-CoV according to WHO guidelines, along with infection prevention and control procedures in healthcare facilities.

WHO continues to request that Member States rapidly report all confirmed and probable cases of MERS-CoV along with information about exposures, testing, and clinical course. A better understanding of how health care workers are infected in health care settings is urgently needed.

WHO does not advise special screening procedures at points of entry, or travel or trade restrictions with regard to this event.

[The above WHO assessment is a timely update on the epidemiology of MERS-CoV to date, including the current event ongoing in South Korea. Even more to the point was a tweet by WHO earlier today that reads "It is not always possible to early identify patients with MERS. All health care facilities should have infection prevention and control practices in place". Healthcare personnel who try to second guess who may have MERS-CoV infection and who has another respiratory illness and therefore do not require respiratory precautions are only contributing to the nosocomial spread of the virus. At present it is clear that significant transmission occurred related to delayed diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection in the index case, and in at least 2 of the secondary cases (cases No. 14 and 16). Given the real time transparency of the South Korean MOH, perhaps the routes of transmission of the virus in the healthcare environment will be better defined following this outbreak. - Mod.MPP]

Fear of MERS Virus Leads Over 230 South Korean Schools to Close
------------------------
More than 230 schools in South Korea have temporarily shut down, officials said on Wednesday [3 Jun 2015[, as fears of Middle East respiratory syndrome spread through the country.

30 South Koreans have tested positive for the virus that causes the disease, which has killed hundreds of people in 25 countries, mostly in Saudi Arabia. The outbreak in South Korea is the largest reported outside the Middle East, where the virus first emerged in 2012 and where a vast majority of the more than 1100 cases and over 470 deaths reported have occurred.

Two of the South Korean patients died on Monday [1 Jun 2015], and 3 others were in critical condition, health officials said on Wednesday [3 Jun 2015]. The authorities were also awaiting test results for 99 people suspected of being infected. The number of people isolated at home or in state-run quarantine centers while officials monitored them for symptoms had risen to 1364 from 790 a day earlier.

So far in South Korea, all the reported cases of the syndrome, known as MERS, were found among medical staff members, patients or visitors at 5 hospitals. But the school closings were just one demonstration of a widespread public suspicion about the government's response to the situation.

The South Korean education minister, Hwang Yoo-Wea, announced class cancellations and precautionary measures after the virus killed 2 [people]. "A lot of fear we see now is rooted in the distrust of the government and what it says," said Yu Min-yeong, head of Acase, a crisis management consulting firm based in Seoul.

The World Health Organization said on Wednesday [3 Jun 2015] that although a large outbreak outside the Middle East was a new development, it was not recommending any screening procedures at South Korean ports of entry, "or travel or trade restrictions with regard to this event."

In an advisory posted on its website, the organization also said that it expected that additional cases would be reported by the South Korean health authorities, but that "consistent application of adequate infection and prevention and public health measures" has stopped transmission of the disease.

"There is no reason for people to panic, and nothing so far that suggests to me that the virus has changed to become more dangerous," said Dr. Allison McGeer, an expert on infection control at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto. Still, as the number of cases grew, alarm increased in South Korea.

Many South Koreans have canceled hospital appointments for fear of infection - a concern critics say was fueled in part by the government's decision not to reveal the names and locations of the 5 hospitals where cases have been discovered. Stores have reported a surge in sales of hand-sanitizing products, which the government recommended as a precaution against the virus. The Defense Ministry has urged men to defer their army reserve training if they suspect MERS symptoms.

As officials have traced the path of the virus in the country, they have found evidence of careless infection control in its public health system. The 1st "index" patient, a 68-year-old employee of an agricultural products company, returned home on [4 May 2015] via Qatar after visiting Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia during the previous 2 weeks.

He developed a fever and cough, both symptoms of MERS, on [11 May 2015] and sought care at 3 clinics. But doctors did not suspect MERS because he did not tell them about his Middle East trip. A doctor and a nurse from those clinics later tested positive for the virus.

It was not until [18 May 2015] that a doctor at a larger hospital asked the government authorities to test the man for the virus. Two days later, he was declared the country's 1st MERS case. Twenty-four other cases have since been traced to that hospital.

One of them, a 44-year-old man who visited his father there, flew to China on [26 May 2015] via Hong Kong, although he had been advised by doctors to stay home. The penalty for ignoring such advice is a fine of up to 3 million won, or USD 2700. He tested positive in China and was quarantined there last week.

Another patient, a 58-year-old woman, was infected through contact with the 1st patient but was released after treatment for asthma. The health authorities did not trace her to another hospital until Sunday [31 May 2015]. She died of MERS on Monday [1 Jun 2015].

"We apologize for the inappropriate initial responses," Moon Hyung-pyo, the minister of health and welfare, said during a news conference on Tuesday. "We were too relaxed."

In yet another case, a 40-year-old man who stayed in the same hospital ward as the 1st patient to get treatment for pneumonia was released after his condition appeared to have improved. Officials traced him to another hospital on Sunday [31 May 2015]. The next day, 2 patients who shared a room with him there tested positive. They were the 1st tertiary, or 3rd-generation, infections reported. Until then, the government had said that such 3rd-generation cases were unlikely.

Government health officials said they had decided not to reveal the names of affected hospitals to prevent a panic surrounding them, a policy even some lawmakers from the governing Saenuri Party have criticized.

On Wednesday [3 Jun 2015], the government offered cash payments to poor people who could not work while they were under government quarantine. The subsidies were announced amid concern that impoverished workers might be reluctant to report contacts with MERS patients for fear of losing their jobs.

The Education Ministry said it was advising schools to consider temporarily closing if they feared a mass infection among students. But during a news briefing on Wednesday [3 Jun 2015], Kwon Jun-wook, a senior Health Ministry official, called the closing of schools "medically wrong." Kim Woo-joo, head of the Korean Society of Infectious Diseases, also opposed the closing of schools, calling it too drastic a precaution.

MERS is caused by a coronavirus from the same family as the one that caused the deadly outbreak in China in 2003 of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. There is no vaccine. Health officials have said that evidence is mounting that dromedary camels could transmit the virus to humans through close contact.

[It is clear that there is panic ongoing in South Korea as this outbreak continues to grow in size. It is unclear why the schools have actually closed for 2 days in the absence of cases in the schools, unless this is a reaction to contact tracing that may have identified individuals in the school system. Unfortunately there are often political reactions to emergency situations that are not always grounded in science, as has been seen with a number of outbreaks in recent years.

It does not appear that this outbreak is different than other nosocomial outbreaks of MERS-CoV seen in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates over the past few years of MERS-CoV activity. The main difference with this outbreak is the real time information provided with details as the outbreak is ongoing, clearly defining the nosocomial transmission in terms of identifying contacts with cases, times of exposures, and locations of exposures (defined as hospital B, D, E, F - to the chagrin of the population in Korea who want to know specifically the names of the hospitals). Ironically, one suspects that the involved/implicated hospitals are probably the "safest" locations to go as they are most likely to have stringent infection control practices in place now. - Mod.MPP]

Officer at Osan Air Base suspected of MERS
----------------------
An Air Force officer was isolated at a military hospital on Wednesday [3 Jun 2015] under suspicions he may be infected with the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), military officials said.

If confirmed, it would be the 1st case of the infection of the deadly respiratory virus in the South Korean military.

The chief master sergeant at Osan Air Base in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, whose identity was withheld, tested positive for MERS, the officials said. They said the military instantly isolated him and some 100 soldiers stationed at the same air base at a military hospital and their homes to prevent further infection on the base. "We isolated a number of soldiers suspected to have contracted the disease to prevent its spread by minimizing others' contacts with those we suspect are infected," one of the officials said requesting not to be named. "The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will determine whether he has been infected or not on Thursday [4 Jun 2015] or later," the official said.

The officer previously had been hospitalized for a fracture at a civilian facility in Gyeonggi Province that treated MERS patients, based on which the military conducted epidemiological research. He, however, is not showing symptoms of the disease such as a fever or cough, the officials said.

South Korea has placed more than 1300 people in quarantine with 30 testing positive for the respiratory virus since the 1st case of the disease was reported on [21 May 2015]. On Tuesday [2 Jun 2015], 2 of the 30 MERS patients died, sparking panic among some locals and forcing over 500 schools to close.

544 schools cancel classes over MERS
-----------------------
More than 500 schools have canceled classes to prevent the spread of a deadly virus that has killed two South Koreans, the Ministry of Education said Wednesday [3 Jun 2015]. As of 5 p.m., students and teachers have been told not to show up at 544 schools, about 3 percent of some 20 000 schools nationwide, a ministry spokesman said. The vast majority of the total, or 439 schools, are in Gyeonggi Province, where the 1st case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in South Korea was reported.

The rest are in North and South Chungcheong Provinces, close to Gyeonggi Province, which surrounds Seoul. In Seoul, 6 elementary schools and a middle school have decided to shut down until Friday [5 Jun 2015] at the request of parents. Still, none of the students or teachers at these schools have come into contact with a MERS patient.

Earlier Wednesday [3 Jun 2015], Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea called for a thorough effort to prevent the disease from spreading to schools, which he said requires extra vigilance. He, however, said a mock college entrance exam scheduled for Thursday [4 Jun 2015] at all high schools will go ahead as planned.

The education office in Gyeonggi Province said it is in talks with school principals in the area to decide whether to make an exception for schools that have canceled classes. The move came as health officials confirmed that 5 more people have been infected with MERS in the country, bringing the tally to 30.

South Korea reported its 1st case of the viral disease on [21 May 2015], when a 68-year-old man who had traveled to the Middle East in April [2015] was diagnosed with the illness. Since then, 2 people have died from MERS. Both had contracted the virus from the 1st patient.

A day earlier, the Gyeonggi Provincial Office of Education released a guideline for schools to determine on their own whether they should cancel classes. The final say has been given to school principals. The Ministry of Education fell short of forcing all schools to close since health authorities have not yet upgraded the MERS alert level from "watch" to "warning."

MERS is a viral respiratory illness that is fairly new to humans with only some 1100 confirmed cases reported throughout the world.
There currently is no vaccine or treatment for the disease.
