In ProMED-mail post "Influenza (29): WHO global update, Asia, America, Europe 20191102.6748823; item [3] USA," the article on [US] influenza activity incorrectly states that ["4 pediatric flu deaths were reported to the CDC in the week ending 26 Oct 2019, for a total of 6 pediatric flu deaths in the 2019-20 season"]. However, all 4 of those deaths occurred in March of 2019, as part of the 2018-2019 flu season [https://gis.cdc.gov/GRASP/Fluview/PedFluDeath.html.]
