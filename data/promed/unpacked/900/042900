[1] Cholera: Congo DR (South Kivu)
Date: Fri 19 Feb 2021
Date: Outbreak News Today [edited]

In the past week, more than 80 cases of cholera including 3 deaths have been recorded in the city of Sange in the territory of Uvira in South Kivu, Democratic Republic of the Congo, according to a 7SUR7.CD news report (computer translated).

According to Marcel Matabishi Nyange, head of the city of Sange, the resurgence of these cases of cholera is due to the lack of drinking water in several entities of this city. "It is now a week that our city is attacked by cholera. Kinanira is among the most affected neighborhoods. The number is increasing day by day because we are already at 87 cases," he explained. He specified that a local association that supplies water to the population is no longer functioning, and the population is now using water that is unfit for consumption.

Cholera is a disease spread by drinking water or eating food contaminated with cholera bacteria. Severe cholera is characterized by large amounts of watery diarrhea, often described as "rice-water stool," because it can have a pale, milky appearance. It can also be accompanied by nausea and vomiting. If untreated, the loss of fluid can be deadly. But simple treatment, including replacing lost body fluids, can lower the risk of death to less than 1%.

[2] Cholera: Mozambique

A cholera outbreak has killed 55 people affected by a jihadist violence since the end of last year [2020] in northern Mozambique, UNICEF said Wednesday [24 Feb 2021]. Nearly 5000 cases of cholera have been reported, especially among hundreds of thousands of civilians living with host families and in makeshift accommodation in camps for internally displaced people.

Last week saw the highest jump of more than 400 new cases, UNICEF spokesman Daniel Timme told AFP. "It doesn't look good. The water and sanitation facilities are not sufficient at the moment and need urgent upgrades," he said. "This is our absolute priority for now, because the survivors of this violence now have the threat of water-borne diseases," he added.

Nearly 670 000 people have been uprooted since shadowy jihadists affiliated with the Islamic State group began to wreak havoc in Mozambique's gas-rich but impoverished Cabo Delgado province in 2017. One in 10 of those displaced have moved in with host families, according to Timme, with some families taking in up to 40 people. The government has now started to resettle the displaced people in newly created villages in safe areas.

[As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience; 2017, pp 113-127, oral rehydration therapy can be lifesaving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Guerrant, et al. (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (e.g., refs. 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant, et al. (1) highlight the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30% to 3.6% (4) and quote sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose- or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref. 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 mL/kg followed by 100 mL/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 mL/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
