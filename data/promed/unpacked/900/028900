Reason for notification: 1st occurrence of a listed disease
Manifestation of disease: sub-clinical infection
Causal agent: Peste des petits ruminants virus
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to the whole country

New outbreaks
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 7 [outbreaks reported from the wilayas (provinces)
of Bechar (2), Naama (2), Tindouf (1), Adrar (1), and Tamanrasset (1);
for details on each outbreak please refer to the OIE report at the
source URL above. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Goats / 734 / 61 / 0 / 0 / 0
Sheep / 579 / 88 / 0 / 0 / 0

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or
inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: samples were taken during an investigation
conducted at the following wilayas: Tindouf, Bechar, Naama, Adrar, and
Tamanrasset (southwestern part of Algeria). This investigation
revealed by competitive ELISA a positive serology on a number of sera.
A virological testing was then carried out, with negative RT-PCR
results for all sera. No clinical signs were observed in the animals
and the situation is normal. Further field investigations will be
conducted and extended to other wilayas.

Control measures
Measures applied: vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected
animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Central Veterinary Laboratory (national
laboratory)
Tests and results:
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Sheep, goats / reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) / 17 Mar 2011 / Negative
Sheep, goats / solid-phase competitive ELISA / 17 Mar 2011 /
Positive

Future reporting

[The location of the outbreaks can be seen on the map appended to the
OIE WAHID report referenced above. The HealthMap/ProMED-mail
interactive map of Algeria is available at
<http://healthmap.org/r/009O>.

This report only contains cases which are subclinical in nature but
we are reporting it because it contains serological evidence of a
disease which has not been reported in Algeria since 2005. Of
additional concern was a major outbreak of disease in Morocco in 2008
which included 92 different events from every major geographic
district in the Kingdom. Generally reports indicated no vaccination
was applied however according to the report submitted on 27 Jan 2009
from Dr Hamid Benazzou, director of Animal Husbandry, Ministry of
Agriculture and Maritime Fisheries, indicated that vaccination was
also carried out based on monovalent live attenuated vaccine and the
disease was resolved in 2009.

I know 1st hand that peste des petite ruminants (also known as PPR or
Kata) can be a very acute and deadly disease with a clear, mostly
respiratory clinical course. I learned this hard lesson while trying
to set up a foundation stock as a veterinary student for ILRI
(International Livestock Research Institute) in Ibadan, Nigeria in
1978. We lost every one of the local sheep and goats we assembled to
the disease. For more information on the range of clinical
presentations see the comments of Dr Adama Diallo below in ProMED-mail
Peste des petits ruminants: origin & distribution(02) 19981012.2007.

But the disease can be subclinical as well, so these serological
positives that present subclinically in sheep and goats are well
within the known range of disease manifestation for PPR. Given the
widespread locations of these 1st 7 outbreaks though, the recent
history of a massive outbreak next door in Morocco and the fact that
Tunisia has similar reports of subclinical disease in the country
between October 2008 and May of 2009, it will be critical to monitor
the progress of the disease, see if it grows to include clinical
manifestation of disease, and make timely critical decisions about
vaccination before it spreads throughout the country.

An excellent FAO EMPRES summary of PPR and the outbreak in Morocco is
provided at
<http://www.fao.org/docs/eims/upload//247342/aj120e00.pdf>. PPR is
regarded endemic in Mali, Republic of Congo, Uganda, and Kenya (OIE
reports). - Mod.PC]
