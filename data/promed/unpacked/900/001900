[My expertise in Italian extends to gestures, which are inappropriate for
e-mail communications.  Therefore, when we received the message below
(translated and summarized from the original by the kindness of Abramo
Ottolenghi), I contacted Dr. Loredana Nicoletti, Istituto Superiore di
Sanita, Rome <nicolett@virus1.net.iss.it> and asked for her comments, which
are found below the translated report. - Mod.CHC]

From: Mario Giannessi <mrgnn@tin.it>

There has been an outbreak in horses of West Nile encephalitis in Tuscany
(region) specifically in the provinces of Pistoia, Luca, Pisa and
Florence.  There were six officially reported cases (with several tens not
reported, including some oustide of Tuscany).  Some horses have been
euthanized but some have recovered after treatment.  A sanitary cordon has
been established by the authorities encompassing twenty boroughs within the
above mentioned provinces.  This cordoned off area includes the Bientina
and Fucecchio wetlands where the is an abundance of water fowl and
mosquitoes.  The cases were reported from horse farms in these areas.  The
preliminary diagnosis, on the basis of serology, was confirmed by virus
isolation at the Pasteur Institute of Paris.  There have been no new cases
for more than a month.

[West Nile virus (WNV) is a member of the family Flaviviridae, genus
_Flavivirus_ and is most closely related antigenically and genetically to
Japanese encephalitis, St. Louis encephalitis, Murray valley encephalitis,
among the more well known flaviviruses.  West Nile virus was first isolated
in Egypt, then in many regions of Africa all the way to South Africa, as
well as in Europe and Asia.
Here is what Dr. Nicoletti told me: "Dr. Giannessi told me that since last
August several cases of encephalitis occurred in horses trained near
Florence and Pisa. On the basis of serological surveys, the Istituto
Zooprofilattico Sperimentale of Teramo hypothesized a West Nile virus
infection. The actual number of horses involved is unknown but at least
three [at least six - Mod CHC] of them died.  Brain samples were sent to
Pasteur Institute in Paris. I meet Vincent Deubel last week and he told me
he isolated a strain of virus, identified as West Nile virus, by PCR.  Now
the temperature in Italy is cold (much colder than one can imagine for a
Mediterranean country) and no additional cases were diagnosed during the
last month. No human cases were diagnosed.
In the past we hypothesized the presence of a West Nile-related virus on
the basis of serologic survey by HI on sheep and goats, but  we never could
demonstrate the presence of true neutralizing antibodies, nor we could
isolate any virus from mosquitoes collected in these regions."
Calisher again: This is fascinating.  WNV has been shown to be responsible
for clinical disease in only a small proportion of infected humans; a
recent investigation of epidemic WNV infection in Romania indicated an
apparent-to-inapparent infection ratio of 1:325.  The Romanian epidemic
took us all by surprise in that antibody to WNV had been found in many
human and other vertebrate populations in Europe and WNV had been isolated
only a few times in Portugal and France, as I recall, but few human or
equid cases had been identified; I am certain that antibody to WNV was
detected in humans and livestock in the former Yugoslavia (Croatia), which
is quite near to Italy.  Most of the early antibody determinations had been
made using the broadly cross-reactive hemagglutination-inhibition test,
suggesting, as did Dr. Nicoletti, that we were dealing with a virus closely
related to WNV but not necessarily that virus.  Given the Romanian epidemic
in humans and these cases in Italian horses, it appears that either WNV
infections have been under recognized or ignored, or, at least as likely,
that WNV is an emerging disease threat to both humans and equids.  Perhaps
Dr. Deubel will comment on the gene sequences and molecular epidemiology of
West Nile viruses, including those from Italy and Romania. - Mod.CHC]
