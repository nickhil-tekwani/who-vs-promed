Bacteria may reduce rice production by nearly 40 percent
--------------------------------------------------------
Rafael Hernandez, president of Fedearroz [National Federation of Rice
Growers], said that the production of rice in some parts of the
country might be reduced by up to 40 percent because of the bacterium
_Burkholderia glumae_.

He indicated that this bacterium has been affecting plantations since
last year [2010] and there are several producers in Meta and Tolima
[departments] who have expressed concern about the issue.

However, he noted that Fedearroz has been providing support and
stressed that the _B. glumae_ is not fought with [agro]chemicals, but
with proper management of the crop.

[_Burkholderia glumae_ causes bacterial panicle blight of rice as
well as bacterial wilts in a number of other field crops. It has been
known in Japan since 1955 and has more recently also been reported in
other rice-producing countries around the world. For example, in the
late 1990's it caused devastating yield losses in India (Bengal), and
several outbreaks have resulted in severe crop losses in the southern
USA.

Symptoms may include sheath, seedling and grain rots, as well as
abortion of florets resulting in greatly reduced grain filling and
potential yield losses of up to 40 percent (this figure may have been
used to estimate possible losses above). Disease development is
favoured by warm temperatures. Despite its economic importance,
virulence mechanisms of _B. glumae_ are poorly understood.

The pathogen is carried on the seed and is often present in
commercial rice seed. No complete resistance has been identified in
rice cultivars anywhere in the world, but varieties with reduced
sensitivity are available and resistance breeding programmes are in
progress.

The disease is considered a risk to rice growers in the region. It is
an emerging disease in Colombia, for example it was reported from
Huila and Tolima in 2009 (ProMED-mail post 20090921.3315). Recent
outbreaks were reported from the Dominican Republic, the southern USA,
and suspected in Costa Rica (see ProMED-mail posts listed below).
