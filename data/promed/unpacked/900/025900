SARS situation update 4 May 2004
From the Medical Department Public Office
-------------------------
During the period 10 AM 3 May 2004 through 10 AM 4 May 2004, Beijing
has reported the confirmation of 3 previously reported suspected
cases of SARS. During this period there have been no reports of
other cases from other provinces.
The 3 cases are the father of the nurse who cared for the index case
from Anhui, a patient on the same ward as the nurse, and a visitor of
this latter patient. Confirmation was made through IgM and IgG
antibody testing and the combined clinical and epidemiologic
histories of these cases.
The 1st case in Beijing [the nurse who cared for the index case from
Anhui] is in good condition, with 18 consecutive days without fever
and will be discharged from the hospital shortly. The other 6 cases
in Beijing will remain in isolation at the Ditan Hospital. 99 close
contacts have been released from observation.
The index case in Anhui has now had 11 consecutive days without fever
and will shortly be discharged from the hospital. 89 close contacts
have been released from observation.
Since 22 Apr 2004, Anhui province has reported 2 cases of SARS,
Beijing has reported 7 cases of SARS, and other provinces have not
reported any suspected or confirmed cases of SARS.

[Since the last update there have been no new cases of SARS reported
in China. With today's information, all previously suspected cases
of SARS have been confirmed as due to SARS coronavirus infection by
the laboratories in China. Confirmation of these laboratory results
by an independent outside reference laboratory is still pending, but
based on the clinical and epidemiologic information, it is highly
likely that all cases will be confirmed. - Mod.MPP]
