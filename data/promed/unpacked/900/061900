"Recently, we found the 1st indigenous African hantavirus, Sangassou
virus (SANGV), in an African wood mouse (_Hylomyscus simus_)
collected in Guinea. Thottapalayam virus (TPMV), isolated from an
Asian house shrew (_Suncus murinus_) in India, is the only known
hantavirus to be hosted by a shrew instead of a rodent. We report the
recovery of hantavirus RNA of a novel sequence from a shrew,
collected in Guinea, West Africa.
During a study of rodent-borne hemorrhagic fever viruses performed in
Guinea in 2002-2004, 32 shrews of the genus _Crocidura_ were
collected and screened for hantavirus RNA by reverse
transcription-PCR. An RNA sample designated Tan826 produced a PCR
product of the expected size. The animal host was a male _Crocidura
theresae_ collected in the grassland savannah around the village
Tanganya (10o 00' 02'' N, 10o 58' 22'' W) in January 2004. Species
identification, following the taxonomic nomenclature, was performed
on the basis of morpho-anatomical characteristics and was supported
by molecular analyses.
Partial L segment sequence of 412 nt was determined by cloning and
sequencing of the obtained PCR product. Nucleotide sequence
comparisons between Tan826 and other representatives of the genus
Hantavirus showed very low sequence identity values, ranging from
67.7 percent (Andes virus) to 72.3 percent (Puumala virus).
Corresponding sequences of deduced viral RNA polymerase (137 aa)
showed only slightly higher similarity values of 69.3 percent (Tula
virus) to 76.6 percent (SANGV). In a maximum likelihood phylogenetic
tree, Tan826 did not unambiguously cluster with any of the major
groups (i.e., Murinae-, Arvicolinae-, Sigmodontinae-associated
viruses) and showed equal relatedness to all 3 groups. This
exceptional position of the Tan826 sequence within the tree is
consistent with its detection in a shrew instead of a rodent host.
Because the sequence is only distantly related to other hantaviruses,
sequences from additional members of the Bunyaviridae family were
analyzed. Despite use of a suboptimal dataset of very divergent and
short sequences, the phylogenetic placement of Tan862 within the
genus Hantavirus could be clearly demonstrated.
Furthermore, a partial S segment sequence (442 nt, 147 aa of the
putative nucleoprotein) was determined to compare Tan826 directly
with the shrew-associated TPMV (for which only an S segment sequence
was available in GenBank). Rather unexpectedly, the Tan826 sequence
showed the lowest similarity to TPMV: 47.5 percent on nt level and
39.4 percent on aa level. The identity values to other Hantavirus
members were also extremely low, 52.2 percent (Sin Nombre virus) to
62.1 percent (SANGV) on nt level and 50.6 percent (Andes virus) to
56.7 percent (Hantaan, Dobrava virus) on aa level. Corresponding aa
sequences were then used for phylogenetic analysis to reduce problems
derived from higher sequence diversities. In the resulting
evolutionary tree, Tan826 and TPMV did not join any of the 3 major
groups but also did not cluster together.
Detecting the virus in one of 32 _Crocidura_ shrews, 15 of them _C.
theresae_, is not sufficient to define _C. theresae_ as a reservoir
animal of this novel virus. However, the unique position of TGNV in
evolutionary trees supports the idea that a shrew instead of a rodent
is the natural host of TGNV. Therefore, it is rather surprising that
TGNV did not form a monophyletic group with TPMV. Before this
observation becomes either a challenge or support for the
hantavirus-host coevolution concept, more extensive sequence data
(for comprehensive phylogenetic analysis) and epizootiologic studies
(to confirm the natural hosts of both viruses) are necessary.
TGNV represents, after the recently described SANGV, a 2nd hantavirus
from Africa. Its low sequence similarity to other hantaviruses should
make this virus serologically distinct from other hantaviruses, as
shown for TPMV. Therefore, human infections by TGNV might be missed
when using antibody detection assays based on antigens from
conventional hantaviruses."

[As the authors point out, this is an interesting report of the
detection of a 2nd hantavirus in Africa and the 2nd in the world in a
shrew. However, it does seem likely that Seoul hantavirus is also
present in Africa, since it is widely disseminated around the world
with the inadvertent transport of infected rats (_Rattus_ spp.) in
maritime shipping. One hopes that these researchers will isolate and
sequence all of Tan826 virus to permit a complete molecular
comparison with the other hantaviruses, and as a candidate for _in
vivo_ studies of pathogenesis.
