The Public Health Directorate at the Ghana Health Service (GHS) has
set up a committee to investigate an outbreak of a disease known as
Lassa fever in the Eastern and Ashanti regions.

Lassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic illness caused by Lassa
haemorrhagic fever virus [species _Lassa virus_, genus _Arenavirus_,
family _Arenaviridae_.] It is transmitted to humans through contact
with food or household items contaminated with rodent [principally
_Mastomys natalensis_] excreta.

In an interview with Citi News, the National Coordinator for Public
Health at the GHS, Dr. Joseph Amankwa, said: "We're trying to find out
what's happening; there is a committee for Lassa fever which is
working on it."

He added: "We are going to do the investigation; it's not only in the
Ashanti region but in the Eastern region as well."

[Lassa fever is an acute viral zoonotic illness caused by Lassa virus,
an arenavirus known to be responsible for a severe haemorrhagic fever
characterised by fever, muscle aches, sore throat, nausea, vomiting,
and chest and abdominal pain. The virus exhibits persistent,
asymptomatic infection with profuse urinary virus excretion in the
ubiquitous rodent vector, _Mastomys natalensis_. Lassa fever is
endemic in West Africa and has been reported from Sierra Leone,
Guinea, Liberia, and Nigeria, but not previously from Ghana. Some
studies indicate that 300 000 to 500 000 cases of Lassa fever and 5000
deaths occur yearly across West Africa. (From: Lassa fever in West
African sub-region: an overview. Ogbu O, Ajuluchukwu E, Uneke CJ. J
Vector Borne Dis. 2007 Mar;44(1):1-11).

Lassa virus infection has not been not recorded previously in Ghana,
but the lesser prevalence of Lassa fever in Ghana was predicted by a
spatial-climatic analysis of Lassa fever data from human cases and
infected rodent hosts in West Africa during the period 1965-2007 (See:
Risk maps of Lassa fever in West Africa. PLoS Negl Trop Dis.
2009;3(3):e388)
http://www.plosntds.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pntd.0000388;jsessionid=A18CA8161C084054F4225595CF9E71CB
and also the ProMED-mail archived report: Lassa fever, predictive maps
- West Africa 20090428.1605). In this survey, information on
contemporary environmental conditions (temperature, rainfall,
vegetation) was derived from the NASA Terra MODIS satellite sensor
data and other sources and for elevation from the GTOPO30 surface for
the region from Senegal to the Congo. All multi-temporal data were
analysed using temporal Fourier techniques to generate images of
means, amplitudes and phases, which were used as the predictor
variables in 3 different models. In addition, meteorological rainfall
data collected between 1951 and 1989 were used to generate a synoptic
rainfall surface for the same region.

Lassa fever-favourable areas predicted by 3 different models covered
approximately 80 percent of each of Sierra Leone and Liberia, 50
percent of Guinea, 40 percent of Nigeria, 30 percent of each of Cote
d'Ivoire, Togo and Benin, and 10 percent of Ghana. This environmental
analysis accounts in some part for the previous absence of reports of
Lassa virus infection in Ghana.
