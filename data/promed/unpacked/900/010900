Ecuador: yellow fever alert along Colombian border
-----------------------------------------------
An outbreak of yellow fever in Putomayo Colombia put the Ecuadorian
population and Cantonal directors located in the region, bordering the San
Miguel river, on alert. An announcement was made by the Provincial Director
of Health at a public gathering of the institutions and neighborhood
organizations of the zone, which were invited to reactivate the
Inter-institutional Committee on the war against classical and hemorrhagic
dengue fever, malaria and yellow fever. In a detailed letter, the Ministry
of Public Health of Colombia gave notification of an outbreak of yellow
fever in the bordering municipalities of Orito and Empalme, located in
Putumayo and Caqueta. It also referred to a case in Sucumbios.

The Inter-institutional Committee was reactivated this past Wednesday [30
Mar 2005] in the auditorium of the Provincial Direction of Health, where
the delegates of the public and private institutions, the Armed Forces, the
sectional governments and the organizations that work in the health field
convened. There, an epidemiologic diagnostic of the zone was carried out.
"If we do not adopt preventive measures, there exists the risk of a
pandemic appearing" said Enrique Castro, the Provincial Director of Health.
The Committee resolved to organize a massive prevention campaign and a
cleaning of the areas considered to be at maximum risk. The group decided
to have a cleaning campaign set for 8 Apr 2005, while on 17 Apr 2005, a
mass-vaccination campaign will be conducted.

Facing a deficit of human and economic resources necessary to finance the
initiative, they invoked local players, who, they hoped, would donate
vehicles and personnel to help in the field work. The Health program of the
San Miguel of Sucumbios Church offered to contribute personnel and
vaccination posts. Delegates of INNFA, IESS [Ecuadorian Institute of Social
Security] and the Armed Forces have committed resources directly to the
activities demanded by the plan. The educational sector added to this a
contribution of students to act as "watchmen" and promoters of the
campaign. "We will make a call to the civilian population so they are added
to the fight against this tropical disease from their homes" said Doreidis
Rodriguez, Director of the National Institute of Children and Families.

[Outbreaks of yellow fever occurred in Colombia in 2003 and early 2004. As
a consequence, there has been a strengthening of epidemiological
surveillance in Colombia, and laboratory diagnosis, with diagnostic
training workshops organized and new sentinel centers opened. As a
preventive measure to avoid reemergence of the urban form of the disease,
there has been a strengthening of vector-control measures in the affected
municipalities in Colombia. There is a need to maintain these actions, and
their sustainability, and to continue to incorporate PAHO recommendations
into activities to prevent and control sylvan yellow fever, and, to deter
its possible re-urbanization. The Ecuadorian authorities are following this
lead. - Mod.CP]

[The main province affected on the Ecuadorian side is Sucumbios, where the
Rio San Miguel joins with the Rio Putumayo in Colombia. The bordering
Province/Section in Colombia is Putumayo. The geography of the area can be
