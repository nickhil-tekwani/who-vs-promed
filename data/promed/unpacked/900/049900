Source: the following basic information was taken from a recent PHARM
report, largely derived from Itar-Tass

Kazakhstan: there have been 78 reported incidents of [human anthrax in the
republic in the past 18 months, most of which were attributed to livestock
owners who had failed to vaccinate cattle. Both private & state farms were
affected. The latter is significant because until recently only problems on
private farms were reported.
Tajikistan: When this report was writen over 200 cases had been recorded in
several regions. Efforts to control spread had been hampered by a lack of
vaccine thanks to inadequate funding.
***
If you fail to vaccinate your livestock, they tend to acquire anthrax. The
owners then butcher the affected livestock, either on point of death (if
good Muslims), or later if Africans, thereby putting themselves at risk of
cutaneous anthrax (= butchers) or enteric anthrax if you eat the affected meat.
Majority of sporadic cases are cutaneous, from butchering; village outbreaks
involve, say 4-5 cutaneous cases then sometimes 5-16 enteric cases depending
on the cooking habits.
If anyone has more up to date information from this region it would be
appreciated. Discussions with my Russian colleagues this summer have
indicated that there were severe outbreaks in Georgia, Azerbaijan, related
areas in southern Russia, and presumeably Chechnyia.
