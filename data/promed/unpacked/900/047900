Epidemiological unit: Not applicable
Species Swine
Susceptible 6
Cases 6
Deaths 0
Destroyed 6
Slaughtered 0

Summary of outbreaks: Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak statistics
Species Swine
Apparent morbidity rate 100.00 percent
Apparent mortality rate 0.00 percent
Apparent case fatality rate 0.00 percent
Proportion susceptible animals lost* 100.00 percent
* Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction
and/or slaughter

Epidemiology - Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection -
Unknown or inconclusive.

Epidemiological comments: Six pigs, which had been previously shipped
to Penghu Island for slaughter from Taiwan Island, were found with
vesicular lesions in a detention pen of the slaughterhouse. The
incident was reported by the prefecture animal disease control
competent authority, and the sick pigs were immediately destroyed on
12 Feb 2010 after sampling. Enforced biosecurity measures including
movement control, cleaning and disinfection are implemented.

Positive results were obtained by the national laboratory by virus
isolation, RT-PCR and antigen detection ELISA tests confirming that
those pigs were infected with serotype O of foot-and-mouth disease
virus. Tracing back to the farms of origin, movement control as well
as epidemiological surveillance were initiated.

Control measures: Measures applied - Quarantine; Movement control
inside the country; Screening; Zoning; Disinfection of infected
premises/establishment(s); Modified stamping out; No vaccination; No
treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied - No other measures

[This is the official notification by Taiwan of the 6 pigs identified
at the offshore slaughterhouse as FMD infected, reported in the local
press and posted by ProMED -- see ProMED ref. below. The farm of
origin was to be inspected.
A map of the location can be seen at the Source URL. - Mod.JW]

[Even though this is an immediate notification, it may or may not be a
continuation of the previous outbreak reported last year in February
2009, as it is the same serotype. Also, the epidemiologic evidence
indicates that the diseased pigs originated on the Taiwan main island,
where last year's [2009] outbreak occurred. Of course, FMD often
occurs in Taiwan through smuggled meat or pigs from the Chinese
mainland, so a complete epidemiologic outbreak investigation will be
of great interest. In any case, Taiwan's problems with FMD,
unfortunately, continue, resulting in a cycle of final notifications,
and then, after some time, a new discovery of disease results in a new
immediate notification to OIE. - Mod.PC]
