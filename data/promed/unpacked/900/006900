It's raining birds on Western Australia
---------------------------------------
The Western Australia sky is raining dead birds in what is becoming a
regular, and mysterious, event for the region. More than 200 ibises,
ravens, ducks, gulls and a pelican were found dead or convulsing near
Perth, raising fears of a mass poisoning. The discovery comes less
than a year after the mystery deaths of 200 gulls only a few
kilometres away, and 2 years after thousands of birds fell from the
skies over the coastal town of Esperance after being poisoned by lead
carbonate.

The latest poisoning has been caused by the pesticide Fenthion, which
is used both for domestic and industrial purposes and which is known
to be highly toxic to birds. The Department of Environment and
Conservation (DEC) has opened an investigation into whether it was a
deliberate bird poisoning or caused by someone dumping large
quantites of the pesticide.

The birds were found on Friday [29 May 2009] at a rubbish tip and
near a quarry site in the Perth suburb of Henderson.

Ken Raine, environmental hazards manager of the DEC Pollution
Response Unit, said that birds were seen frothing at the mouth and
staggering around at the site before scores of dead birds were
discovered within a kilometre radius of the landfill site.

"Necropsies carried out on the birds found Fenthion in high
concentration," the DEC told The Times. "It was in a landfill site
and the birds were found close to the site, but we don't yet know
where the pesticide came from."

Fenthion is an organophosporous insecticide used in horticulture to
control pests such as fruit fly and aphids and pest birds such as
weaver birds. It is also sold for domestic use to control fleas on
dogs and in domestic fruit fly sprays. The DEC was unable to say what
quantity of the pesticide would have been present to kill birds in
such large numbers.

Birds began dropping out of the sky in the beachside Perth suburb of
Woodman Point over several days last July [2008], sparking a big
investigation into local industries. Post-mortem examinations on
dozens of carcasses failed to establish a cause of death, but
Fenthion poisoning was ruled out at the time, according to the DEC.

In December 2007, 5000 birds including yellow-throated miners, honey
eaters and wattle birds were killed by lead carbonate blowing through
Esperance as it was being exported through the town's port.

An investigation into the [2007] birds' deaths found that local
children and adults had dangerously high levels of lead in their
blood. A local company, Magellan Metals, escaped prosecution over the
way it handled the transportation of lead through the town, but fears
remained over the potential threat to humans.

[Fenthion is classified as an organophosphate and its mechanism of
action is to inhibit cholinesterase or actylcholinesterase. It is
toxic to birds by inhalation and by contact and consequently it is a
highly effective avicide.

Historically, secondary poisoning existed when birds of prey consumed
smaller birds that had been poisoned by fenthion but had not yet
died. Due to the secondary effects on predatory birds, avicide uses
were withdrawn by the manufacturer in 1998.

The product is still in existence and can still poison a variety of
avians. - Mod.TG]
