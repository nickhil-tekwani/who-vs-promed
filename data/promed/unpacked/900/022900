Russian officials have quarantined a large poultry farm in Siberia because
of a suspected outbreak of bird flu, news reports said Saturday [20 Aug 2005].
If confirmed, it would be the 1st major occurrence of the lethal virus
among birds in Russia, and international health officials expressed concern
that the disease had spread closer to Western Europe.
About 142 000 birds are being monitored at a commercial farm in the Omsk
region of Siberia, the Russian news agency Interfax reported, quoting a
federal agency that tracks the disease.
The presence of the deadly H5N1 strain of avian influenza was reported [in
July 2005] in Siberia, but only among wild birds and free-range chickens on
small family farms.
Avian influenza has killed at least 61 people in Vietnam, Thailand and
Cambodia since early 2004, mostly farmers and poultry workers in close
contact with the animals. Millions of birds have been slaughtered in Asia
in an attempt to control the disease.
The World Health Organization has warned that the viral strain affecting
chickens, ducks and wild fowl could develop into a form that spreads easily
among humans, exposing millions of people to the disease.
The exact means of transmission is unclear, and it is not conclusively
known whether the disease can be passed by eating infected poultry.
WHO reported Thursday that the spread of the H5N1 strain in Russia "is of
concern because it creates further opportunities for human exposure."
Russian officials said there have been no human infections since the virus
was detected in July 2005.
There are about 233 million head of poultry in commercial enterprises in
Russia, according to the Russian Poultry Union. The spread of the disease
into the industry would be economically devastating for the country and
could affect neighboring countries, including those of the European Union.
International officials fear that, in September, migrating birds escaping
the Russian winter might carry avian influenza across the Black Sea and
into southeastern Europe and North Africa.
Countries in the region and in the European Union have begun banning the
importation of feathers and live birds from Russia.
"We are preparing for a worst-case scenario," said Renate Kunast, Germany's
consumer protection minister, announcing emergency restrictions this month
on poultry kept in the open. Free-range chicken is popular in Germany.
The Netherlands had already ordered poultry farmers to move their
operations indoors to reduce the risk of exposure to wild birds and help
contain any outbreak.
The British government is sending 50-page pamphlets to doctors with
information on dealing with any human outbreak, the Financial Times reported.
Russian officials said that if the presence of bird flu is confirmed at the
Omsk farm, all the poultry there would be killed, according to Interfax.
About 11 000 birds have died of the disease in Russia and an additional 127
000 have been slaughtered on small farms, officials said. Up to 40 Russian
villages have been hit by bird flu and 78 are under watch, according to the
federal veterinarian and plant health oversight service.
