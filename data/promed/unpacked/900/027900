--------------------------------------------------------------
The article you comment on likely relates to a recently published
paper in the Australian Veterinary Journal, which provides some
context. The paper is:

A Cooper, R Hedlefs, N Ketheesan, B Govan: Serological evidence of
_Coxiella burnetii_ infection in dogs in a regional centre. Austral
Vet J 2011; 89(10): 385-7.

Abstract
--------
Objective: investigate the seroprevalence of the causative agent of Q
fever, _Coxiella burnetii_ in domestic dogs in the Townsville region,
North Queensland, Australia.

Method: blood samples were collected from dogs attending veterinary
clinics for routine procedures.

Results: an overall seropositivity of 21.8 percent (95 percent
confidence interval (CI) 21.6-22.1 percent) was observed. A
retrospective study of samples collected in the same region during
1984-85 was also performed, with an overall seropositivity of 16.0
percent (95 percent CI 15.9-16.2).

Conclusion: evidence of _C. burnetii_ infection in domestic dogs may
have public health implications for dog owners, as well as
veterinarians because of occupational exposure. This study is the 1st
known investigation of _C. burnetii_ seroprevalence in dogs in
Queensland.
