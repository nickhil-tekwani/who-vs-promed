The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 6 Apr 2019:
- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 1146, of which 1080 are confirmed and 66 are probable. In total, there were 721 deaths (655 confirmed and 66 probable) and 345 people cured;
- 303 suspected cases under investigation;
- 16 new confirmed cases, including 11 in Katwa, 3 in Vuhovi, 1 in Beni, and 1 in Mandima;
- 7 new deaths of confirmed cases, including 5 community deaths -- 4 in Katwa and 1 in Mandima; 2 deaths at the Beni ETC;
- 3 new recoveries, including 2 releases from Butembo ETC and 1 from Beni ETC;
- 3 Katwa health workers (including 1 death) are among the new confirmed cases. The cumulative number of confirmed/probable cases among health workers is 85 (7.4% of all confirmed/probable cases), including 30 deaths.

News of the response
Laboratories, the pillar at the heart of the response
-----------------------------------------------------
- Laboratories play a central role in the response to the Ebola outbreak. The positive result of a sample taken from a patient will trigger a series of interventions around the patient to minimize the risk of contamination of relatives and the spread of the epidemic. These interventions include the transfer of the patient from the transit center to the Ebola treatment center, the vaccination of the patient's contacts, the disinfection of his household and the health centers through which the patient would have passed, as well as the psychological follow-up of the patient and of his family. It is therefore important to ensure rapid communication of laboratory test results to both the patient and other teams in the Ebola response.
- Community feedback mechanisms revealed that residents of the affected areas, particularly Butembo and Katwa, complained of the slow availability of laboratory test results and the perception that local laboratories and labs are not involved.
- The laboratories are managed by the National Institute for Biomedical Research (INRB) whose director, Professor Jean-Jacques Muyembe, is the chairman of the national laboratory commission in the context of the Ebola response. To date, 7 mobile laboratories have been established in Beni, Butembo, Goma, Katwa, Mangina [North Kivu], Bunia, and Komanda [Ituri]. This is the 1st time that the INRB has had the technical capacity to deploy as many mobile laboratories in the field as part of an active Ebola outbreak. While the majority of the sites have 2 GeneXpert machines, the sites of Beni, Butembo, and Katwa have installed 3-4 per site to quickly test the hundreds of samples collected each day. In addition, at all sites, the INRB ensures the recruitment of local human resources to ensure the transfer of skills.

Vaccination
-----------
Since the start of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 96 136 people have been vaccinated [total numbers of people vaccinated in North Kivu, Ituri, Tshopo, and Haut-Uele provinces can be seen at the source URL above].

[With the number of laboratories, availability of therapeutics, and a vaccine, one would think the control effort would have the upper hand. But this report indicates 3 more health workers infected with 1 death, 16 new confirmed cases, 5 community deaths (6 community deaths reported the day before). The outbreak shows no signs of slowing down and rather appears to be building.

It is not clear whether results truly are slow in being reported back to the individuals. Perhaps these are the Ebola negative cases and other etiologies are being investigated, or the lab may want to confirm results. - Mod.LK]

News of the response
Butembo rapid impact operations
-------------------------------
- Recent community dialogues in Butembo town and surrounding areas revealed that part of the community's reluctance was due to the willingness of the population to see the Government and partners invest more in the development of the region and improvement of the general living conditions of the population.
- The Minister of Health, Dr Oly Ilunga Kalenga, had initiated discussions with the Government's technical and financial partners in order to establish a medium and long-term development plan to restore the region socially and economically.
- Thus, capitalizing on the ongoing investments in the region and in order to be able to pose immediate and visible actions for the community, the World Bank is committed to support the financing of rapid impact operations through the Eastern DRC Stabilization Project for Peace (STEP) with the support of the Social Fund of the DRC (FSRDC).with the support of the Social Fund of the DRC (FSRDC).
- The STEP project is being implemented in 7 provinces of the country, including North Kivu, since 2014. Its 3 components are community support, livelihoods and job creation, as well as capabilities. Created in 2002, the FSRDC is the Government's executing agency whose mission is: to improve the living conditions of the Congolese population and their access to social services through the rehabilitation and reconstruction of community economic and social infrastructures; and to create income and employment in rural and urban areas through the execution or implementation of income-generating micro-projects to alleviate poverty and promote economic and social development.
- The 1st phase of the quick-impact operations, which began this week [week of 1 Apr 2019], involves the recruitment of 1000 people for labor-intensive public works for road maintenance in the Butembo and Katwa districts. The 2nd phase, currently being prepared by the FSRDC and the technical services of the Town Hall and the Office of Roads and Drainages (OVD), will include the recruitment of an additional 1000 people and will start in May 2019. The recruitment procedure aims to maximize the use of local skills and resources for both labor and equipment purchases to ensure greater redistribution within the community.

[The Conversation, abridged, edited]
https://theconversation.com/the-drcs-ebola-outbreak-has-all-the-makings-of-a-humanitarian-crisis-114636
[Also available at https://allafrica.com/stories/201904050876.html]
[Byline: Jacqueline Weyer]

It's been 8 months since the start of the current Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). By the beginning of April [2019], almost 700 people have succumbed to the disease, making this the 2nd worst Ebola outbreak ever recorded. It's second only to the West Africa outbreak of [2014] to 2016 that claimed more than 11 000 lives. And it seems that the end is not yet in sight. The Conversation Africa's Ina Skosana asked Jacqueline Weyer about this deepening public health crisis.

Why can't this outbreak be brought under control?
-------------------------------------------------
The outbreak is reported from the eastern DRC, and specifically in the Ituri and North Kivu provinces. This region has been ravaged by political instability and conflict for more than 2 decades; much of the violence has its roots in the Rwandan genocide of 1994.

Against this unstable backdrop, the delivery of healthcare services and other public health interventions that are required to interrupt the outbreak has become very problematic and dangerous business.

In recent months, there have been reports of healthcare facilities and healthcare workers being targeted by violent groups. In some instances, there have been large scale interruptions of health services and containment efforts.

This has had dire consequences: the outbreak has spread to 21 health zones in the 2 affected provinces. In some of those zones, the outbreak can be controlled. But others, such as Butembo, have proven more challenging.

The outbreak is devastating vulnerable communities that are already affected by displacement and violence. UNICEF has identified nearly 700 children who've been orphaned as a result of this outbreak. This outbreak has all the makings of a humanitarian crisis.

Could the outbreak spread even further?
---------------------------------------
The outbreak is occurring where the DRC's eastern borders meet Uganda, Rwanda, and South Sudan and the fear is that it may spread across the borders to these countries. The effort to prevent this has been extensive, and the World Health Organisation (WHO) reports that more than 46 million travellers crossing borders in these areas in the past few months have been screened to prevent the disease spreading to other countries. To date, no case of Ebola has been exported beyond the borders of the DRC.

What needs to be done to bring the DRC closer to ending this outbreak?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A major obstacle has been community resistance for health interventions and mistrust of the health care workforce. It's crucial that measures are introduced to enhance community engagement and participation in the public health activities related to the outbreak. In its latest external situation report, the WHO says that some painstaking strides are being made in winning communities' confidence.

Secondly, it's important to manage the growing risk of fatigue among healthcare workers, public health professionals and other stakeholders as the outbreak continues to evolve with no end in sight. These workers are being pushed to the edge, working long hours, days, weeks, and months under very trying circumstances.

Reactive and vigorous responses are required until the outbreak is declared over: taking care of the health care and public health workforce is critical. This is easier said than done and in addition, the safety and security of the outbreak workforce has been an issue in past months. Given the complex political situation of the region, an end to the violence may not be expected.

The WHO reports that steps have been taken to improve the safety and security situation for health care workers. More guards have been deployed at treatment centres and the accommodation used by healthcare workers.

It's also crucial to ensure that adequate resources are available to keep up the fight against this outbreak. This includes sufficient, uninterrupted supplies of the Ebola vaccine to see the DRC through this outbreak and beyond. The WHO says that there's been no interruption of vaccine supply to date. But as the outbreak continues to grow concerns are being raised as to whether this situation will remain the same.

[Byline: Martina Schwikowski]

The Ebola outbreak in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo has become difficult to contain. Many locals distrust health authorities trying to combat the epidemic, which poses a significant challenge for their work.

"I wouldn't say the situation is completely out of control," Sevim Tuglaci from Doctors Without Borders (MSF) told DW, "but we need to rethink and change our strategy."

[Sevim Tuglaci from MSF] said there is a lack of education and knowledge about Ebola in Congo. The next steps for MSF remain unclear, but Tuglaci said they have to think from the perspective of locals. "Aid workers have to go to the communities, talk to the village elders," she explained, adding that this can be difficult because of the security situation in some places."

- Sat 6 Apr 2019. Comment
From: Bjorg Marit Andersen <bomarand@hotmail.com> [edited]

The Ebola situation seems to be out of control.
1. Until now (6 Apr 2019), 82 HCW out of total 1107 Ebola cases (7.4%) are infected and 29 HCW are dead. This high rate of infection among HCWs strongly indicate that they are still not well enough protected during work with Ebola patients.
2. A rather high number of cases in the region are vaccinated. But still there is no information concerning the vaccination effect. For instance, if vaccinated persons are among the 1107 cases of Ebola.
3. The high-risk virus Ebola is still defined as not airborne by WHO/CDC- This is a great failure -- in my opinion -- when fighting a highly deadly disease.
4. Suspected Ebola cases are not treated at the same protective level (use of PPE/isolation) as confirmed Ebola cases, according to WHO/CDC. This is a serious drawback when trying to stop an epidemic!

[ProMED thanks Dr Andersen for submitting these important points.
Comment 1: her point about healthcare workers (HCWs) getting infected is true, they appear not to be sufficiently protected. They should be vaccinated since they are likely becoming infected in community centers where patients can be seriously ill and personal protection is lacking.

Comment 2: the lack of information on vaccine efficacy is an important issue. There has been no information on numbers of individuals who although being vaccinated have become infected. Of course, the data need to be analyzed because some recipients may have already been infected when receiving the vaccine. But no information has been reported on the efficacy during the outbreak.

Comment 3: unlike respiratory illnesses, which can spread by particles that remain in the air after an infected person coughs or sneezes, Ebola is spread by direct contact with body fluids of a person who is sick with Ebola. I know of no evidence it is airborne. One would expect clusters of infections if it were.

Comment 4: suspected patients are treated without the same level of PPE as confirmed cases. This may be a matter of availability of PPE and high number of suspect patients. - Mod.LK]

[A campaign is ongoing] that places social skills at the heart of the effort to roll back the dreaded disease.

The UN children's agency UNICEF says 30 percent of the 683 deaths registered so far are children or aged under 18 years.

Many children are collateral victims, such as a 5-year-old boy playing football with Consolee Katsiwa, a psychologist in a creche run by UNICEF. His mother died of Ebola a day earlier, Katsiwa said.

"We are keeping him under observation since he was in direct contact with his mother," she said, adding that he would be monitored for 21 days -- the time taken for the virus to incubate.]

[4] Personal account: Belfast doctor tells of fighting Ebola in African war zone
Date: Sun 7 Apr 2019
Source: BBC News N. Ireland [abridged, edited]
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-47816130


Imagine being a doctor fighting to contain an outbreak of one of the world's deadliest diseases.

Then imagine doing so in a war zone where more than 100 armed groups are operating.

Belfast-born doctor Stacey Mearns has just returned from North Kivu in the Democratic Republic of Congo where there has been an outbreak of Ebola.

It is the 2nd time Dr Mearns, who works for the International Rescue Committee, has battled the disease.

She worked in Sierra Leone during the West Africa outbreak, which killed more than 11 300 people between 2014 and 2016.

"In West Africa, I think as a global community we left it quite late to respond," Dr Mearns said. "By the time we had the financial resources and enough partners on the ground, the outbreak was already very out of control.

"It's been the opposite in Congo. We saw in Congo a very early response from the international community, very early entrance of partners into the response, and very early funding of the response."

However, she said a big difference between the outbreaks was the dangerous political situation in DR Congo.

Lessons learned
---------------
"With Ebola, you do learn how to protect yourself and the measures you can put in place to protect you from acquiring the virus. But with conflict, there's a whole different dimension associated with that.

"So for me, definitely I was more concerned about the conflict and fighting in North Kivu than Ebola itself."

Dr Mearns, a former NHS doctor who joined the International Rescue Committee (IRC) 4 years ago, said lessons learned from the earlier West Africa outbreak have been used in the DR Congo outbreak.

The incubation period can last from 2 days to 3 weeks, and diagnosis is difficult.

Healthcare workers are at risk if they treat patients without taking the right precautions to avoid infection.

People are infectious as long as their blood and secretions contain the virus -- in some cases, up to 7 weeks after they recover.

Dr Mearns said that while, as a former NHS doctor, she had seen people die, nothing could have prepared her for the volume and pace of death she witnessed working in Sierra Leone. "You just see immeasurable amounts of suffering and all of that takes its toll on you.

"When I think back to West Africa, there were times of just feeling hopeless. You were seeing the outbreak worsening, feeling exhausted, and tired from the work you were doing. I think the hardest moments are those moments of just wondering if this is ever going to end.

"We're 8 months into the outbreak and we're seeing it currently spread at its fastest rate yet.

"During the last 2 weeks we've seen a record number of infections, so we've still got a long road ahead of us to contain and end the outbreak. And it's likely to get worse before it gets better."

International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt said the UK was playing a key role in combating the disease.

"From helping to put specialists like Dr Mearns on the ground, to developing a vaccine -- the UK is playing a crucial role in the fight against Ebola," she said.

"Disease does not respect borders, so UK aid is playing a significant role in saving lives and stopping the spread of this devastating and deadly virus is firmly in our national interest."

The dangers faced by health workers were illustrated during the West Africa outbreak when British nurses William Pooley and Pauline Cafferkey nearly died after returning to the UK in 2014 with Ebola.
