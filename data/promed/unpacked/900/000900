[1] Foot rot - Punjab

Heavy rain plays havoc with standing crops
------------------------------------------
There could be heavy rains with thundershowers in most parts of Punjab
and Haryana in the next 48 hours [21-22 Sep 2008], according to the
Met forecast. Punjab Agriculture officials said that if rain
continued, it would be disastrous for standing crops. It is rare that
rains lash in the month of September.

There are also reports of the paddy [rice] crop having developed plant
diseases. After bacterial blight [see recent ProMED-mail post
20080923.3002], a disease that dries up a plant's leaves, foot rot
disease has been reported in parts of Punjab in paddy, and the problem
could worsen if water is not quickly drained, farmers and agricultural
scientists said. Punjab state yields 11 percent of India's paddy.

[2] False smut

False smut of rice, once considered a minor disease, has now become a
serious disease in Tamil Nadu and other rice growing states of India.
For the past 3 years, the disease has been reported in many places in
an alarming proportion.

The disease is caused by a fungus and also known as Lakshmi disease of
rice. Yield loss is not only due to the occurrence of the smut balls
but also due to increased sterility of kernels adjacent to the smut
balls.

[For rice, there are 2 diseases named foot rot: a bacterial disease
caused by _Erwinia chrysanthemi_ (different biovars are being renamed
as _Dickeya_ spp.), and the fungal bakanae disease caused by
_Gibberella fujikuroi_, which is also called foot rot in India and
Pakistan. Both have been reported to cause significant crop damage,
and either could be the disease referred to in item [1].

False smut of rice is caused by the fungus _Ustilaginoidea virens_.
The disease can reduce yield by up to 75 percent, and affects grain
quality and seed germination rate. Large orange to brown-green
fruiting structures on one or more grains of the mature panicle
develop. Surface spores spread the disease to immature panicles, and
disease development is favoured by high humidity. The "smut balls"
survive between crops in the soil. Disease management includes
phytosanitation, cultural methods, fungicides, and use of resistant
cultivars, which are available in India. The mycotoxin ustilotoxin is
produced by the pathogen and may be of concern in rice products.
