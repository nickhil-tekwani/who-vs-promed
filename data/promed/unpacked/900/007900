OMAF [Ontario Ministry of Agriculture and Food] has become aware of 2 cases of Potomac horse fever (PHF) in Ontario as of early August 2013.

Samples collected from an anorexic and febrile horse in Essex County confirmed that the horse was suffering from PHF. The horse subsequently died. A horse in the Ottawa area also tested positive for PHF. It was exhibiting profuse watery diarrhea but is reported to be recovering.

PHF is reported every year in several regions of the United States and Canada, including southwestern and eastern Ontario. PHF cases occur in Ontario in the late summer.

A trematode [a fluke, a flat worm], living in freshwater snails and aquatic insects such as caddis flies, mayflies, damselflies, dragonflies and stoneflies, is the reservoir for _Neorickettsia risticii_, the bacterium responsible for PHF. Horses contract the disease by ingesting the snails or insects in hay, grain, pasture or water. The incubation period is 10-18 days.

Initial clinical signs include anorexia, lethargy and fever, followed by enterocolitis, dehydration and diarrhea. This may progress to toxic shock, laminitis or death (30 percent mortality rate). Endotoxemia is characterized by a bright red/purple line ("toxic line") on the gums. The Essex County horse had a toxic line. The disease may also cause abortion in pregnant mares.

Other diseases such as salmonellosis, clostridial infection, NSAID toxicity [non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug], antimicrobial-associated enteritis, fungal colitis and toxic enteritis have similar signs to PHF. Treatment includes intravenous oxytetracycline and, in horses with signs of enterocolitis, intravenous fluids and anti-inflammatory agents. Early treatment increases the likelihood of survival, and veterinarians in endemic areas often initiate antibiotic treatment prior to diagnosis if a horse is showing signs consistent with the disease in late summer or fall.

PHF is not contagious and does not cause disease in humans. Sporadic disease caused by _N. risticii_ has been reported in dogs and cats.

The following disease control steps can be taken:
- Vaccination may decrease clinical signs but it will not prevent infection and illness. It protects against only one strain of the more than 14 identified strains of _N. risticii_. Neither horse mentioned above had been vaccinated against PHF.

- Cover feed supplies and check water buckets and troughs for dead insects.
- In endemic areas, turn off outside lights near stables and pastures during summer months to prevent attracting insects.

Veterinarians in Ontario should included PHF in their list of rule-outs when examining horses during the summer and fall that are anorexic and febrile. Laboratory samples should include EDTA blood from live animals, or lung, liver and spleen from necropsy. Serology is of limited value because of the high prevalence of false-positive titres.

This disease has been referred to in the past as equine monocytic ehrlichiosis, or equine ehrlichial colitis. It is best known for its gastrointestinal signs such as enteritis and diarrhea. This disease is caused by _Neorickettsia risticii_, an intracellular organism which is a member of the Erlichiaea family.

According to the isolates obtained from clinical cases, there is diversity in the organism, and each isolate has a different pattern of antigenic proteins. Therefore, Potomac horse fever (PHF) is caused by more than one strain of _N. risticci_.

_N. risticii_, _N. sennetsu_, SF agent, and _N. helminthoeca_ are antigenically cross-reactive, and inoculation with _N. sennetsu_ protects horses from Potomac horse fever (15,21).

Current vaccines are only made using one strain, which likely explains its lack of efficacy in some cases.

Cases of Potomac horse fever have a seasonal presentation with the highest number of cases with clinical signs in July, August, and September.

Several studies have been conducted to determine the route of infection and have revealed that a parasite, living in freshwater snails and aquatic insects, is a reservoir for _N. risticii_. The parasites and _N. risticii_ have been found in adult and immature forms of aquatic insects, such as caddisflies, mayflies, damselflies, dragonflies, and stoneflies. Therefore, the seasonality of PHF is likely related to the seasonality of the flying insect.

But how does an equid become infected? These types of insects do not feed on warm blooded mammals, so it is likely that an equid may ingest an aquatic insect or snail while grazing, or consume a flying insect that has landed in drinking water. It has also been suggested that the insects might be attracted to the barn area by outdoor lights during the night.

The typical clinical signs observed in horses with PHF include: fever, anorexia, colic, depression, ileus (nonmotile gastrointestinal tract -- the horse does not defecate) or diarrhea, and laminitis [inflammation of the hoof. - Mod.SH].

Clinical signs and severity vary, but common to all cases of PHF is the manifestation of colitis. The onset of colitis can result in depression and anorexia and may or may not be accompanied by a fever and/or diarrhea. However, some horses with PHF can pass normal-looking feces without showing any signs of colitis.

The 1st prominent sign of PHF often observed by owners is a decrease in feed intake. In fact, some horses may not initially show any other clinical signs except not eating. Usually, this anorexia is followed by dehydration and toxemia characterized by very bright looking mucous and a bright red/purple line on the mucosal surface above the teeth (toxic line).

Many equids, upon becoming infected with PHF will develop a fever with an initial rise in temperature of about 103-106 degrees F [39-41 degrees C], but the presence of this fever may go unnoticed as this initial fever resolves within hours. However, it is often followed by 3-7 days of persistent fever, along with other clinical signs.

Laminitis often develops in cases of severe endotoxemia, but in some occasions it can be the only clinical sign. Laminitis in most cases results in euthanasia of the equid within days of the onset.

_N. risticii_ can cause abortions, and it is related to placentitis and retained placenta in most cases. The aborted fetus will show signs of the infection as well.

The drug of choice to treat _N. risticii_ infection in equids is oxytetracycline. The organism is inside the cells and is, therefore, difficult to treat. Oxytetracycline is able to interfere with the control mechanisms of _N. risticii_ and allows the macrophage to eliminate the organism. Oxyetracycline should be administered by a licensed veterinarian once a day for 3 to 5 days, and it is most effective when given in the early stage of the disease.

Several vaccines are commercially available in the United States, but their efficacy is questionable. Research has shown that once an equid develops an infection with _N. risticii_, the equid can develop an immunity to that particular strain for as long as 20 months.

In contrast, vaccination has been associated with a poor immune response. Research has shown that only 50 per cent of the vaccines are protective at 6 months after vaccination, and protection decreases to 33 per cent after 9 months. Vaccination may decrease clinical signs, but it will not prevent infection and illness.
