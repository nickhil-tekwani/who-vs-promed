A new disease distinguished by persistent muscle pains, fatigue and a low
fever has been discovered in France.
Officials of the national public health network said yesterday doctors had
identified about 20 cases of the mysterious, not-yet-named malady dating as
far back as 1993, and were still searching for its cause.
They believe it results from infection by a micro-organism similar to
_Mycobacterium tuberculosis_, the [microorganism] which causes tuberculosis.
They said samples of infected muscle tissue had been sent for analysis to
the U.S. Centres for Disease Control, which concluded that the disease was
previously unknown.
The typical patient was 40 to 50 years old and with a history of frequent
hospital stays, chronic disease or poor hygiene, the officials said.
Pain is typically experienced in the muscles, joints and limbs and might
shift from site to site in the body over time, they said.
