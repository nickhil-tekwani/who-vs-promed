Chronology of SFTS in Japan
---------------------------
[1] Yamaguchi prefecture: 1st death

The Japanese health ministry confirmed on Wednesday [30 Jan 2013] that the death of an adult in Yamaguchi Prefecture last fall [2012] was related to a new viral infection often related to mites. Known as severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome [SFTS], the infection was 1st discovered in China in 2009, and the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare says it has a 12 percent fatality rate. They add that this is the nation's 1st death in relation to the virus.

Investigators say the unnamed victim in Yamaguchi had no records of recent travel to overseas locations, and health officials say there were no traces of bites from a mite. The viral infection has most often been seen as being transmitted by mites, which are similar to a ticks. However, the syndrome can also be spread via contact with an infected person's blood or other bodily fluids.

Symptoms can include nausea, depletion of blood platelets, a decrease in appetite, and headaches, says the health ministry. At this time, there is no vaccine available to prevent the infection. Officials say they did perform genetic tests on the virus that killed the Japanese national and found that it did not come from China, but rather originated in Japan.

[2] Ehime, Miyazaki prefectures: 2nd and 3rd deaths
Date: Mon 4 Feb 2013

Japan's Health Ministry said on Wednesday [30 Jan 2013] that it had confirmed 2 more deaths were caused by an unknown viral infection transmitted by mites. With the number of deaths now at 3, the 2 men, one from Ehime Prefecture, the other from Miyazaki Prefecture, join the 1st victim, a woman from Yamaguchi Prefecture. All died last fall [2012] from the infection, known as severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome.

The virus was 1st discovered in China in 2009, but until now has never turned up in Japan, and the 3 who died had no records of recent travel overseas. Fortunately the ministry dismissed the concerns over whether this infection might be spreading across Japan, as it explains that these deaths were only discovered as authorities re-examined overlooked cases.

Further adding to the complications, however, is that genetic tests on the virus have shown that the 3 victims died of a strain that originated in Japan, not China. The Health Ministry says there is a 12 percent fatality rate, but there is no vaccine at this point to prevent infection. Officials say that in addition to the fever, symptoms can include nausea, depletion of blood platelets, a decrease in appetite, and headaches. While the virus is most often transmitted by mites, it can also be spread through contact with an infected person's blood or other bodily fluids.

[3] Hiroshima prefecture: 4th death

The Japanese Health Ministry stated on Tuesday [19 Feb 2013] that a 4th victim has been identified as dying from a tick-borne virus infection. The victim, a man from Hiroshima Prefecture, died in the summer [2012], making him the 1st among 3 others who died in the fall [2012]. These 4 instances are said to be the country's 1st occurrences of the virus, which, as of now, there is no vaccine for.

Just last week [week of 11 Feb 2013], the 2nd and 3rd deaths were revealed -- one man from Ehime Prefecture and another other from Miyazaki Prefecture, followed by a January [2013] statement that said a woman from Yamaguchi Prefecture was believed to be the first. The infection has been identified as thrombocytopenia syndrome, which causes a severe fever that usually develops within 2 weeks. Other symptoms can include nausea, depletion of blood platelets, a decrease in appetite, and headaches. The virus was 1st discovered in China in 2009 and, until now, has been understood as being transmitted by mite or tick bites.

What makes this situation more peculiar is that no bite marks have been found on any of the victim's bodies, and they have no records of recent overseas travel. In addition, genetic tests have shown that this strain of the virus has originated in Japan, not China. While last week [week of 11 Feb 2013] the Health Ministry said it was not necessary to be concerned about the infection's spread across the country, as the deaths were only identified in re-examined overlooked cases, the National Institute of Infectious Diseases will now look into nine other suspected cases that have been reported throughout Japan.

[4] 8 cases, 5 fatalities; 3 survivors from Nagasaki, Saga, and Kochi prefectures

The Japanese Health Ministry said this week [week of 11 Mar 2013] that it had identified 3 more cases of people infected with a mysterious tick-borne virus. This brings the total number of cases to 8, and while the 1st 5 were all deaths, these 3 people, infected between 2005 and 2012, all recovered.

The virus causes severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome, or SFTS, and symptoms are said to usually develop within 2 weeks. While there is no vaccine at this time, the virus was 1st discovered in China in 2009 and until now has been seen as transmitted by mite or tick bites. But of the people in Japan who have died, no bite marks were found, and they had no records of recent travel outside the country. Likewise, the Health Ministry has confirmed that the strain of the virus has genetic origins from Japan, not another country. Of those that died, the 1st was in the summer of 2012, while the others were in the fall [2012], but the identification of the tick-related virus as the cause wasn't made until February [2013]. The Health Ministry is still looking into another 5 suspected cases.

The 3 surviving infection cases all occurred before the summer 2012 death. The 1st was a man in his 50s from Nagasaki Prefecture who became ill in November 2005, followed by a man in his 80s in Saga Prefecture, and a woman in her 80s in Kochi Prefecture, in August 2010 and April 2012, respectively. The 3 were all hospitalized and received treatment, eventually recovering. As the 2nd and 3rd deaths were confirmed, an official from the Health Ministry said that he believed it wasn't necessary to be concerned about the infection's spread across the country. While levels of concern should certainly be kept in check, as it is obvious the virus can be treated, it is also clear that the number of identified cases is rising faster than expected.

A woman died earlier this month [April 2013] from a new virus carried by ticks, the Kagoshima Prefectural Government revealed on Mon 8 Apr 2013. This is the 1st case of infection confirmed in the prefecture and the 10th case confirmed in Japan, according to the prefectural government. The woman was the 6th person in the country to die from the disease.

According to the prefectural government's department of health promotion, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome was discovered after the woman went to a hospital at the end of last month [March 2013] to have a checkup because she had a fever. She had no record of traveling abroad at least one month before the onset of the illness.

The prefectural government has not revealed the woman's age group or residential area to protect her identity.

[ProMED-mail thanks Kunihiko Iizuka for compiling this chronology of Japanese occurrences of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), a tick-borne disease 1st recognised in China. The number of cases in Japan appear to be increasing and contracted locally rather than imported from China. Transmission from ticks has not been verified in all cases. Currently the tally stands at 11 confirmed cases and 7 fatalities. - Mod.CP]
