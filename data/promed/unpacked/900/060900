Approximately 54,000 cows infected with Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy
entered the food chain in Britain, in the years before the disease was
identified in 1986, according to a new report.
The study, published in the 30 October 1997 issue of the journal Nature
(v389, p903) show people were exposed to the disease as early as 1980. Up
to 54,000 infected animals were slaughtered for human consumption, before
clinical onset of BSE, between 1980 and 1985.
"Most of those animals were in the early stages of the incubation period so
hopefully they were not very infectious," said Professor Roy Anderson of
Oxford University.
