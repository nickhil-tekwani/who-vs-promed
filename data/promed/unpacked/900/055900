Question
--------
What about the possibility that these alligators are eating infected birds
and there is no mosquito involved in the transmission of the virus to
alligators?

Wheeler, Alan
<Alan.Wheeler@gov.ky>
[The possibilities seem endless; transmission by nibbling WNV infected
humans, swallowing infected mosquitoes, etc. Anyone willing to hazard an
informed opinion? - Mod.CP]
