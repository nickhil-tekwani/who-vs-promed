Bird flu kills thousands of chickens in South Sulawesi
------------------------------------------------------
The Central Government has decided to isolate South Sulawesi from
chicken trading, as a fresh outbreak of bird flu has killed some 25
000 chickens last week [2nd week March 2005], an official said on
Wednesday [16 Mar 2005].
Deputy chief of the South Sulawesi office of the agriculture
ministry's livestock department Arifin Daud said the government had
also distributed some 200 000 doses of a locally produced vaccine to
try and stop the disease from spreading. "There were indications of
bird flu in the dead chickens. However, not all the chickens died
because of bird flu," Arifin said in a hearing with the South
Sulawesi Legislative Council.
He said the bird flu hit the poultry business in the regencies of
Maros, Sidrap, Wajo, Pinrang, Soppeng & Parepare.
Indonesia has been hit by sporadic bouts of bird flu since 2003, but
unlike in Viet Nam, Thailand and Cambodia, no cases have been
reported in humans.

Government confirms bird flu in W. Java, S. Sulawesi
----------------------------------------------------
The Government confirmed on Wednesday [16 Mar 2005] an outbreak of
bird flu in South Sulawesi and West Java, suggesting the slaughtering
of infected chickens and vaccination.
"Yes, it is avian influenza. But the viruses have not mutated,"
Minister of Agriculture Anton Apriantono said after meeting President
Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono.
Anton said the outbreaks in West Java in January 2005 and South
Sulawesi last month [February 2005] had killed thousands of chickens.
He said the ministry had ordered an isolation for South Sulawesi from
inter-island chicken trading.
Indonesia has been hit by sporadic bouts of bird flu since 2003, but
unlike in Viet Nam, Thailand and Cambodia, no cases have been
reported in humans.

[Indonesia sent its last follow-up report, No. 7, to the OIE on 10
Mar 2005, indicating H5N1 outbreaks in 2 districts -- Wajo and
Soppeng -- in the Sulawesi Selatan Province. According to the report,
the disease, affecting native chicken layers and broilers, was
introduced by illegal movement of animals from neighboring countries
(imported fighting cocks).
Official information on the situation in West Java will help.
According to the previous follow-up report, 6 Oct 2004, the outbreaks
were in East and central Java. For an administrative map of
Indonesia, see
