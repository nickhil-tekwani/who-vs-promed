Radioactive cesium found in Meiji baby formula
----------------------------------------------
Radioactive cesium of up to 30.8 becquerels per kilogram has been
found in infant formula produced and sold by Meiji Co, the food
company said on Tuesday [6 Dec 2011], citing an internal examination.

The company suspects a link with the radioactive leaks from the
Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant damaged by the 11 Mar 2011
earthquake and tsunami, saying ingredients for its Meiji Step milk
powder may have come into contact with airborne radioactive cesium
when they were being dried at a plant in Kasukabe, Saitama Prefecture,
between 14 and 20 Mar 2011.

Radioactive cesium has been found in baby formula for the 1st time
since the March 2011 disaster, prompting the Health, Labor and Welfare
Ministry to begin looking into the matter.

The levels of cesium-134 and cesium-137 contained in the product
remain below the government-set allowable limit of 200 becquerels per
kilogram. A radiation expert said the reading was not at levels that
would have an immediate impact on human health.

The company nonetheless plans to offer customers free replacements,
affecting around 400 000 850-gram cans of the Meiji Step formula.

Amid concern that babies are more susceptible to the harmful effects
of radioactive materials than adults, the ministry has planned to set
a new limit for food products for babies.

The company will offer replacement products for batches with
recommended consumption dates of Oct 3, 4, 5, 6, 21, 22, 23, and 24
next year [2012], according to the manufacturer. The dates are printed
on the bottom of the cans.

Of the 23 samples with recommended consumption dates ranging from
September to November 2012, 4 contained radioactive cesium of between
21.5 and 30.8 becquerels per kg.

The formula in question came from milk produced before the March 2011
disaster, according to the company.

"Because the cesium is diluted to 3 to 4 becquerels (per kg) when the
powders are added to hot water, we don't think it will have an impact
on health. But we still want to address the anxieties of those who
bought the product by providing replacements," a public relations
official of the company said.

The examination was conducted after a civic group in Nihonmatsu,
Fukushima Prefecture, found radioactive cesium in the company's infant
formula in a test late last month [November 2011] and asked Meiji to
conduct a similar test.

When the health ministry examined 25 infant formula samples from
multiple manufacturers, including Meiji, between July and August 2011,
the cesium level in each sample was below the minimum detectable limit
of 5 becquerels per kg.

Meiji commands a leading share of roughly 40 per cent in domestic baby
formula sales. The same product has been exported to Viet Nam under a
different name.

Meanwhile, Meiji's Chinese unit said Tuesday [6 Dec 2011] infant
formula sold in China does not pose a safety risk as it has been
produced in Australia.

[Radioactivity is measured in units called becquerels (Bq). One
becquerel corresponds to one radioactive disintegration per second.
Becquerels per kilogram (Bq/kg) define the concentration of
radioactivity in a kilogram of material.

Normal radiation form sun, food, and multiple other sources may be as
high as 65 becquerels. Although the level infants consume would be
expected to be below that number, it demonstrates this is a low level.
However, the article did not tell us if level of radiation was in a
particular volume of reconstituted milk. Since infants consume more
than one bottle per day, I do not know if the levels listed are per
ounce, per milliliter, per feeding, or even per day. That would make a
lot of difference in how much someone might receive.

Cesium 134 has a very short half life and will reach lower levels
quickly. Cesium 137 has a half life of about 30 years.

Cesium functions a bit like potassium in the body. It is readily
absorbed and distributed in the body. The point is, this is not a body
surface contamination.

However, the level found is a very low level and is a regulatory
limit, not necessarily a level that will cause harm.
