The Bongaon Market, barely 9 km (5.6 mi) from the Bangladesh border is home
to Jessore district, where bird flu was detected last year [2007]. This has
always been a porous boundary that sees a lot of unofficial free trade.
This trade includes poultry, a trade that may easily have brought with it
the dreaded flu into Indian Territory.
Even now, reports say, the supply from across the border has just declined
and not completely stopped. The BSF (Border Security Force) has been now
roped in order to stop any poultry from entering India. But many feel that
these strictures have come too late, considering that fact that Bangladesh
has been fighting bird flu for almost a year. "Have you seen the geography
of the region we are talking about? It's very difficult to seal it
effectively. Smuggling of poultry is rampant," said Pradeep Kumar,
secretary, Animal Husbandry.
In recognition of the porous and difficult-to-patrol borders in South Asia,
the UN's food agency is working on a bird-flu joint surveillance between
India, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Myanmar, all of which share common borders.
"We will try to bring the government officials from these countries to
develop their protocol for legal trade and live poultry," said Dr Mohinder
Oberoi, regional coordinator, Food and Agriculture Organisation [FAO].
Not so long ago it was said that to cross the Indo-Bangladesh borders
illegally, one could bribe the border guards with some chickens. But slowly
there is a realisation that avian influenza virus is tougher to monitor
than cross-border terrorists or illegal immigrants.

Not willing to incur any financial loss because of the outbreak of bird
flu, well-networked cartels in West Bengal are smuggling out chicken and
poultry products from affected areas, even sending consignments to
neighbouring states to minimise the loss. This could be one of the reasons
why the deadly virus has spread so fast -- from one district in the
beginning to almost 8 districts now.
Two lorries full of poultry birds and 4 lorries carrying eggs were
intercepted at the Birbhum-Murshidabad border on Tuesday [22 Jan 2008].
These were being smuggled out of the Rampurhat area in Birbhum where the
virus was first detected and where culling operations are on.
"We are trying our best to cull the birds in Rampurhat sub-division, but
there is public resistance and some more time is needed. We cannot rule out
the fact that some poultry birds are being smuggled out. We have informed
the police. This is a dangerous trend and may help spread the virus. The
poultry that was intercepted will be culled," said Dilip Das, director of
the state Animal Resources Development department.
"It is a fact that birds from affected areas are being smuggled out. We
have told the police to keep vigil but they just don't have the numbers
when you look at the magnitude of the problem," said Prasanna Kumar Mondol,
SDO [sub divisional officer], Rampurhat.
In Birbhum, which was the first to be affected, 4 lakh [400 000] birds are
to be culled. So far 117 736 birds have been culled -- a figure which the
locals say is exaggerated. Culling teams have ceased to function in many
pockets, including 20 villages in Kestoghora and Masra GP under Rampurhat 1
block, areas of Margram under the Rampurhat 2 block. Recently, West Bengal
animal resource development [ARD] minister Anisur Rahman had visited
Rampurhat and announced that 300 culling teams will operate in the area.
However, only 134 teams have worked in the district till date, with only 56
teams operating in Rampurhat.
The 2 trucks loaded with eggs, intercepted early on Tuesday morning [22 Jan
2008] at Nagpur check post in Nalhati on the National Highway 60, were
coming from a poultry farm in Margram. Around 10.20 a.m., 4 trucks carrying
chickens were also caught in the same area. According to locals, chickens
are being shifted to Jharkhand, which is only about 20 to 25 km (12.5-15.5
mi) from Rampurhat. In Rampurhat subdivision, there are 450 poultry farms
with over 1.5 lakh (150 000) birds, though culling teams did not find a
single bird at many places.
"Government employees are not serious at all. Even in Mahipara, where the
bird samples tested positive for the 1st time, culling operations remains
incomplete. There are 13 small and big poultry owners in Margram 1 and 2
gram panchayat [local government body] who have smuggled out chickens and
eggs. We have informed the district magistrate about this," said Muhammed
Zakir Hussain, panchayat sabhapati of Margram.
Jayanto Bhattacharya, owner of a poultry farm in Rampurhat, said: "It is
quite natural that given a chance every one would like to shift his stocks
and try to minimise losses."

[The complex situation in West Bengal, with demonstrated grave difficulties
in the application of adequate quarantine and animal movement restrictions,
certainly causes a serious headache to the authorities. The illegal animal
and animal-products movement within, into, and out of the affected area(s),
vividly described above, mean continued spread of the H5N1 HPAI (highly
pathogenic avian influenza) virus. The Indian authorities will have to make
soon a decision between continued stamping-out policy and the possible
implementation of mass vaccinations. - Mod.AS]
