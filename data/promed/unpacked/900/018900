Rabid animals found in Lamar County
-----------------------------------
The State Laboratory has confirmed that 2 foxes have tested positive
for rabies. Health officials are urging residents of the area to stay
away from wild or stray animals that appear to be unafraid of humans
and those that exhibit behaviors that are unusual of their characters.

All Lamar County residents are encouraged to take precautions to
protect their families and pets against rabies by learning signs of
rabies and vaccinating pets.

Rabies is a preventable viral disease of mammals that is most often
spread through the bite of an animal that is infected with the disease.

Rabies infects the central nervous system, causing encephalopathy (a
disease of the brain) and ultimately death. Early symptoms of the
disease include fever and headache. As the disease progresses,
neurological symptoms appear and may include insomnia, confusion,
hallucinations, a slight or partial paralysis, hyper salivation, or
difficulty swallowing.

"If you notice a wild nocturnal animal moving about in the daytime and
the animal appears to show no fear of people or the animal seems to
behave in a sick or abnormal way, the animal may be infected with
rabies," said Todd Driver, Lamar County Environmental Health Manager.
"Therefore, people should avoid the animal and report it to the local
health department or animal control."

Treatment and prevention practices for rabies have proven to be almost
100 percent effective when initiated promptly. Please report any bite,
scratch, or other contact with a wild animal to your local
environmental health office.

"It is important to remember that although rabies occurs more often in
wildlife, domestic animals like the family dog or cat can become
infected as well. I strongly encourage owners to have all pets
vaccinated to prevent rabies," said Driver.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the
majority of rabies cases reported annually occur in wild animals such
as raccoons, skunks, foxes, and bats. Since July 2008, Lamar County
has submitted 12 specimens to the State Lab and 3 have been confirmed
positive for rabies. A raccoon tested positive in July 2008 and 2
foxes have tested positive since [17 Jun 2009].

For more information about rabies, please contact Lamar County
Environmental Health at 770-358-1483.

[While encouraging people to stay away from strange acting animals, it
was a great opportunity to stop rabies by vaccinating their pets. It
stops the spread from within a family if a rabid animal should attack
the family pet. Dogs, cats, horses, cattle, and even other livestock
should be vaccinated. While it may seem like an expense, it is the
safest insurance against a deadly disease. - Mod.TG]
