Update (8) on SARS cases in Singapore
-------------------------------------
As at 21 Mar 2003, a total of 39 people with SARS have been reported to the
Ministry of Health. The 5 additional patients reported today comprise 4
hospital staff and 1 close contact of a patient. Three patients have been
discharged from hospital. The other 36 patients are still in hospital. All
the patients are stable except for 7 patients who are in a serious condition.

To date, apart from the 3 initial people who had travelled to Hong Kong, a
total of 19 family and friends of cases, and 17 hospital staff have been
diagnosed with SARS. So far, all the cases of SARS have been linked to the
initial 3 cases. No new index cases have been reported. In addition, no
further cases have occurred among hospital staff as a result of infection
from known or suspected cases of SARS after the implementation of enhanced
infection control precautions.

Schools and preschool facilities will reopen on 24 Mar 2003. The Ministry
of Health and the Ministry of Education have assessed that there is no need
to extend the school break. The spread of SARS is still confined to family
and friends, and hospital staff who have had close contacts with infected
patients. As an added precautionary measure, the children of contacts of
known cases will be asked to stay away from school for another week. This
is to prevent any community spread. MOH is also working closely with the
Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Community Development and Sports
to step up vigilance in schools, preschools and child care centres.
Children who have fever will be asked to seek medical attention and to
return to school only when they are well.

MOH would like to appeal to all parents whose children have been to Hong
Kong, Guangdong province in China, or Hanoi to closely monitor their
children. They should not be sent to school if they have fever and should
be seen by a doctor immediately. All schools and preschools have been
advised through the Ministry of Education and Ministry of Community
Development and Sports to look out for children who are unwell with fever
and have been to the affected areas. Such children will be immediately
isolated and their parents contacted to bring them to seek medical attention.

The Department of Health has launched websites on atypical pneumonia to
provide health advice on the prevention of respiratory tract infection and
latest information on the cases: (English) and
(Chinese).

Part 2 - Students' health under close watch 20 Mar 2003
-------------------------------------------------------
The Department of Health (DH) confirmed 4 child cases of atypical
pneumonia, who are now under treatment in hospitals. The consultant in
charge of the Disease Prevention and Control Division of DH, Dr Tse
Lai-yin, said the 4 children comprised two 15 year old twin sisters, a 5
year old girl and a 7 year old boy. They are among the 165 people confirmed
today to have contracted atypical pneumonia.

The twin sisters have been taking sick leave from their schools, namely Tak
Oi Secondary School and CCC Heep Woh College in Wong Tai Sin since 13 Mar
2003. They were admitted to the Princess Margaret Hospital (PMH) on 14 Mar
2003 and they are in a serious condition.

"DH staff visited their schools on 14 Mar 2003. Investigations showed that
the general environmental condition of the schools is good and that
students and teaching staff have not reported unusual patterns of sickness
in relation to the outbreak," Dr Tse stressed.

"The 2 sisters are likely to have contracted the disease from their mother
who is a health care worker in the Prince of Wales Hospital (PWH) and has
been confirmed to have contracted the disease earlier," Dr Tse added.

The other 2 cases, the 5 year old girl and the 7 year old boy, were
admitted to PWH on 16 and 18 Mar 2003, respectively. They are in a stable
condition. "They developed symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection on
13 and 17 Mar 2003, respectively.

"DH has informed the kindergarten and school, namely Diana Anglo-Chinese
Kindergarten and SKH Holy Spirit Primary School in Sha Tin, of the
situation. There is no sign that other students there have been infected,"
Dr Tse said. "We believed that the sources of the virus were not in the
school and the kindergarten concerned. It is most likely that they
contracted the disease from their sick family members who have been under
treatment in PWH," Dr Tse noted.

Meanwhile, DH is investigating a suspected atypical pneumonia cases in
which the younger sister of the boy, aged 4, is suspected to have
contracted the disease. She developed symptoms on 14 Mar 2003 and was
admitted to PWH for observation.

"The Department and the Education and Manpower Bureau (EMB) will continue
to closely monitor the health conditions of students and staff of these
schools," Dr Tse said, adding that "there is no sign of spread of atypical
pneumonia among the student population at this stage."

EMB has issued school circulars to all schools on 13 and 18 Mar 2003
respectively, reminding them to disseminate to students and parents DH's
health advice on the prevention of respiratory tract infections. DH and EMB
will jointly hold 2 briefing sessions tomorrow for all school principals to
remind them of the precautionary measures, followed by health talks for all
teachers on 25, 27, and 28 Mar 2003, respectively.

To enable parents of the schools involved in these cases to have a full
picture on the situation and obtain proper health advice, DH and EMB have
already arranged a seminar for parents whose children are studying in the
two Wong Tai Sin schools. Health talks for parents of the primary school
and the kindergarten involved will also be lined up soon.

Dr Tse reiterated that child care centres, kindergartens, and schools
should take the following precautionary measures to prevent respiratory
tract infections:
- Cleanse toys and furniture properly;
- Put on a mask if you develop symptoms of respiratory tract infection, or
when you are taking care of a sick person who has respiratory symptoms;
- Cover nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing;
- Wash hands when they are dirtied by respiratory secretions - for
example, after sneezing;
- Use liquid soap for hand washing and disposable towel for drying hands;
- Do not share towels;
- To take sick leave and have good rest when feeling unwell;
- Ensure adequate ventilation of indoor premises;
- Maintain a healthy lifestyle.

SARS case update from Taiwan CDC 21 Mar 2003
--------------------------------------------
The Center for Disease Control, Department of Health, Taiwan, reports the
5th and 6th cases of probable SARS at this day. The 5th case is a 37 year
old woman who traveled to Guangdong, China, from 2 Feb 2003 to 11 Mar 2003,
and returned to Taiwan. On 13 Mar 2003, she developed symptoms compatible
with SARS. Chest radiography revealed infiltrates over bilateral lower lobes.

The 6th case is a 25 year old man who had not recently travelled to China
or Hong Kong, or the regions with epidemic. He developed symptoms
compatible with SARS on 17 Mar 2003, while his father was the index case in
the family and also the first reported case in Taiwan. His chest
radiographs showed infiltrates in both the upper lobes. His father
travelled to Guandong, China, during the period 5 to 21 Feb 2003 and
returned with symptoms of flu and developed SARS early in March 2003. Both
cases are already treated in isolated environment.

All necessary sampling for pathogen study and isolation procedure have been
undertaken. The health authority in Taiwan continues to keep close
observation and surveillance and to provide all necessary health care for
these individuals.

Part 2: Clarification

From: Yu-Chen Hsu <yuchen@cdc.gov.tw>
Source: Taiwan - Center for Disease Control


In response to your comment on Prof Peter WS Chang's letter on Thu, 20 Mar
2003 regarding the latest Taiwan SARS information, I would like to clarify
by providing the following facts.

The laboratory diagnosis for the 3 cases reported earlier on 17 Mar 2003
has been conducted by the CDC in Taiwan, results of the specimen test for
influenza virus type A (including avian flu virus H5, H7, H9), type B,
parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, herpesvirus
and Nipah virus are all negative.

I believe it was a type-writing mistake. It would be highly appreciated if
you could help me with the above-mentioned correction.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome ­ update
------------------------------------------
Cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) reported last week from
Hong Kong, Hanoi, and Vietnam (1) have now been observed from other
countries, including Canada, Germany, Singapore, Slovenia, Taiwan,
Thailand, and the United Kingdom (UK). Local transmission, however, has
only been reported from Canada, Hanoi, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan
(2). From 1 Feb 2003 to 19 Mar 2003, 219 suspect or probable cases have
been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO), including 9 cases
that have died (2).

Two probable cases in the United Kingdom (UK) had been reported to the PHLS
Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre (CDSC) by 20 Mar 2003. The first
is a man aged 65 years who was returning from Hong Kong to Manchester via
Amsterdam on 15 Mar 2003. He is in hospital under strict isolation
measures. His condition is reported to be improving (3). The second case is
a man aged 30 years from London, who flew back from Taiwan on 16 Mar 2003
after visiting his family for 3 days. He is in hospital and his condition
is stable. Both cases have abnormal signs on chest x-ray, a compatible
respiratory infection, and fulfil the WHO case definition for SARS. Neither
is known to have been in contact with any probable or suspect cases.
Passengers travelling on the same flights as the 2 cases have been advised
to seek medical assistance if they develop high fever and respiratory
symptoms within 10 days of their return. The same advice is given to all
people visiting places where local transmission has been reported. The
flight details of the 2 UK probable cases have been released by the
Department of Health (DoH): press statements are available on the PHLS
website <http://www.phls.org.uk/topics_az/SARS/menu.htm>.

A wide range of laboratory tests have been undertaken for specimens from
cases in a number of laboratories worldwide, coordinated by WHO. There are
reports from a number of laboratories of a virus of the Paramyxoviridae
family having been observed by electron microscopy, in samples from some of
the cases outside the UK (4). It would be premature, however, to attribute
the outbreak to this source.

The DoH and the PHLS have issued a joint press release, presenting the key
points of the UK specific response to this international threat (5):
- All doctors have been alerted to identify any illness in returning
travellers that may be associated with this outbreak
- Travellers returning to the UK from any of the affected countries and
presenting symptoms compatible with the case definition should seek medical
advice
- People from the UK are not restricted from travelling to any of the
affected countries.

Guidance on microbiological investigations has been developed by the
Influenza Laboratory, and the Respiratory and Systemic Infection Laboratory
of the PHLS Central Public Health Laboratory. In addition, CDSC has
coordinated the development of general guidance for public health
professionals, and more specific guidance for general practitioners, and
those who work in infection control and management in hospital. Advice for
travellers from the UK is also provided. A surveillance form for reporting
suspect and probable cases to CDSC can also be downloaded. All information
is available from the PHLS website

Atypical pneumonia under control in S. China
--------------------------------------------
GUANGZHOU, March 21 (Xinhuanet) -- Over 70 per cent of atypical pneumonia
patients in south China's Guangdong Province have recovered, said the
provinical public health departments on Friday. The epidemic, which has
been afflicting the province since November last year [2002], has been
brought under control, experts from the departments said.

Cases have been detected in 7 cities in the province, and the number of
cases peaked between 3 and 14 Feb 2003, they said. The number of new cases
has been declining since 15 Feb 2003, and they have been found only in
cities. The experts said that doctors have ruled out plague and bird flu as
possible causes of the pneumonia, and efforts continue to identify the
virus. Symptoms of the epidemic include high fever, muscle stiffness,
coughing and shortness of breath. Those most at risk are health care
workers and family members in close contact with patients.

SARS: Researcher is first victim in Thailand
--------------------------------------------
A World Health Organization researcher who was among the first to
investigate the outbreak of SARS in Hanoi last week is the first victim of
the disease in Thailand, according to Bamrasnaradura Hospital in
Nonthaburi. [A 40 year old male physician] is currently in critical
condition. He is being closely monitored by the medical team. He entered
Thailand on 11 Mar 2003 and was immediately transferred to the hospital
with flu symptoms and high fever which later developed into pneumonia.

Dr Somsit Tansuphasavasdikul, the doctor in charge of [this patient], said
though no confirmation had been received from specimens of [his] phlegm and
blood sent to the CDC in the US, his symptoms matched those of patients
having SARS. [His] condition had been stable for the past few days, though
he showed no signs of responding to treatment.

The condition of 2 suspected cases reported in Nopparat Ratchathani
Hospital in Min Buri and in Lop Buri had improved, he said.

WHO has also established a cooperative network with two daily
teleconferences among the most affected Asian countries, Europe, and North
America. "Participants are pooling data on cases and sharing X-rays, at
this stage one of the main tools for distinguishing between suspected and
probable cases," WHO said. According to WHO, the antiviral drug ribavirin
had, to some degree, improved the clinical condition of patients in Hong Kong.

ProMED-mail
<promed@promedmail.org>

[One point of interest in today's reports on this unfolding outbreak is the
mention of local transmission occurring in Taiwan, a close contact of an
earlier defined case of SARS. The number of cases continues to increase,
but they continue to be in close contacts (either family or in health care
personal) of initially identified SARS cases outside mainland China.
Confirmation of the exact numbers of cases involved in the Guangdong
outbreak is still pending, albeit the Xinhuanet newswire report in [6] [A]
above mentions geographic involvement of 7 cities in the province. There is
also mention of increasing surveillance in schools in both Singapore and
Hong Kong as the condition has been identified in children who were family
contacts of SARS cases.

In 2 earlier postings on SARS today there was information on the continued
laboratory efforts towards confirmation of the etiology of this outbreak.

We have also included the newswire report that the first case of SARS seen
in Thailand was in one of the physicians who went to VietNam to investigate
the outbreak of SARS in Viet Nam. A sobering reminder to everyone of the
risks taken by the many individuals involved in the investigation of
disease outbreaks. - Mod.MPP]
