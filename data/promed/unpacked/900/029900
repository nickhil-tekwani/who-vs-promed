Mexico: West Nile virus infection surveillance data: correction
-------------------------------------------------
[The most recent data in the Resumen Epidemiologico file accompanying
the pictorial Maps of West Nile Virus Activity in Mexico have not
been updated since 9 Dec 2004. These data were posted on Fri 25 Dec
2004 as part [1] of West Nile virus update 2004 - Western Hemisphere
(28) 20041224.3407
<http://www.cenave.gob.mx/von/archivos/ResumenCASOSVON.xls>.
The cumulative total for equine cases contained an error in
transcription. The correct data for equine cases is reproduced below.
The cumulative totals for human and avian cases remain are unchanged
and represent the situation as of 9 Dec 2004 - Mod.CP]
Cumulative totals - Humans
--------------------------
As of Thu 9 Dec 2004, the cumulative total of human tests carried out
in Mexico remains at 387, and no additional seropositive individuals
have been detected: i.e. in total, 387 individuals resident in 29 of
the 32 states have been tested for evidence of West Nile virus
infection; 386 were seronegative and asymptomatic, and one individual
in the state of Sonora exhibited signs of disease [see: West Nile
virus - Mexico (Sonora) 20040905.2486].
Cumulative totals - Equines
--------------------------
As of Thu 9 Dec 2004, a total of 3623 horses from 31 (reduced by one)
of the 32 states had been tested for evidence of West Nile virus
infection. Of these animals, 2500 were seronegative and 1023 (28
percent) were seropositive. All the seropositive animals were
asymptomatic. These figures represent an additional 229 animals
tested since Thu 2 Dec 2004, 57 of which were seronegative and 172 of
which were seropositive.
Cumulative totals - Birds
--------------------------
As of Thu 3 Dec 2004, the number of birds tested remains unchanged at
4940 (given incorrectly as 44 940 previously) since the update of Thu
4 Nov 2004. These birds were collected from 8 of the 32 states and
have been tested for evidence of West Nile virus infection. Of these
birds, 4750 were seronegative and 188 were seropositive (and
considered to be asymptomatic), and one case each in the states of
Sonora and Baja California exhibited signs of disease. (Initially,
both birds appear to have been assigned to the state of Sonora). The
seropositive birds were detected in the states of Baja California,
Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, Queretaro, Sonora, and Yucatan.

[It is noteworthy that horses in Mexico are continuing to test
seropositive; indeed 75 percent of those tested in the last 7 days
were seropositive. None exhibited signs /symptoms of disease. -

New York State: Cases of West Nile Virus Infection Plummet
---------------------------------------------------
Cases of West Nile virus infection plummeted in New York State in
2004, health officials said. The mosquito-borne illness prompted some
panic when it first hit America in 1999, but drew little attention
this year in New York. In all, 10 people tested positive statewide
for the virus in 2004, compared with 71 in 2003. Around 200 birds had
confirmed West Nile in 2004, down from 1367 in 2003. Experts aren't
sure yet whether cases will remain scarce or whether the drop is
simply part of a "down" cycle in the virus' lifespan. Still,
officials say the virus, which is transmitted from birds to people by
mosquitoes, isn't going anywhere.
"The bottom-line message for people is that they need to realize West
Nile virus is here to stay," said Tom Skinner, spokesman with the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
West Nile virus spread from Africa and other countries to the New
York City area in September 1999 and soon migrated to other states.
The disease rarely causes serious symptoms. But for about one percent
of the population, it behaves like a possibly fatal encephalitis or
meningitis.
The drop occurred across the Northeast, with Delaware, Massachusetts,
Rhode Island, and Vermont reporting no human cases of West Nile virus
infection.

Louisiana: Rebuttal of Statements Concerning West Nile virus-infected Birds
--------------------------------------------------
[Part [3] of West Nile virus update 2004 - Western Hemisphere (28)
20041224.3407 contained an article entitled: "Louisiana: West Nile
Virus-infected Bird Found at Latest Recorded Date" by Steven Landry.
ProMED-mail is now posting the following response to Mr. Landry's
statements by Dr. Gary Balsamo on behalf of the Louisiana Office of
Public Health. - Mod.CP]
Representatives of the Louisiana Office of Public Health (OPH) would
like to rebut several of the claims made by Steven Landry, the
author, and entomologist Glenn Stokes, Mosquito Control Contractors,
Inc., in a previous ProMED-mail posting entitled, "Louisiana: West
Nile Virus-infected Bird Found at Latest Recorded Date".
The author asserts that the discovery of a positive cardinal on 13
Dec 2004 in Lafayette Parish is the "latest-ever case" of West Nile
virus in the state of Louisiana. Mr. Landry may not have been aware,
but a cardinal collected in routine OPH surveillance from Tangipahoa
Parish on 14 Dec 2004 also tested positive at the Louisiana
Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory. In addition, a cardinal
collected from St. Tammany Parish on 17 Dec 2003 was found to be
positive in the previous season. The statement is also factually
incorrect, because it ignores the reality that over the past year,
later winter collections of birds, including several cardinals, a
gull, a grackle, a hawk, a crow, and a sparrow, were found positive
from 7 Jan to 11 Feb 2004, indicating that the disease is present
well into the winter months.
Mr. Landry also indicates that "health officials pinpointed" this
cardinal in Iberia Parish. The OPH Infectious Disease Epidemiology
Section (IDE) is responsible for and monitors the collection,
testing, and reporting of all positive dead birds in the state, as
well as surveillance for West Nile virus in the human population.
Infectious Disease Epidemiology has no information regarding the
collection or testing of this bird. Our assumption is that the bird
was collected and tested outside normal channels. The Infectious
Disease Epidemiology section states unequivocally that the "health
officials" quoted in the article are not associated in any way with
the Infectious Disease Epidemiology Section.
Glenn Stokes is also quoted as stating, "We have fewer human cases,
but that's because there's immunity that's being conferred to the
general population and the birds." Although one would expect
immunity in animal and human populations to increase with time, no
solid evidence that this phenomenon has already occurred presently
exists. In fact, in a sero-survey done in the Slidell area following
the 2002 outbreak, only 1.7 percent of the sampled population
exhibited antibodies against West Nile virus.
This low level of seropositivity, along with relatively low numbers
of incident cases in the following seasons, indicates that other
factors besides population immunity are at work. Mr. Stokes'
statement seems to oversimplify a very complicated natural event.
The above clarifications are provided by the OPH Infectious Disease
Epidemiolgy Section and Dr. Gary Balsamo, State Public Health
Veterinarian, Sarah Michaels, Arbovirus Surveillance Coordinator, and
Charles Anderson, Entomology Consultant.

[2 concluding statements from Dr. Balsamo and colleagues provide an
intriguing ending to the West Nile Virus Updates for 2004: "Although
one would expect immunity in animal and human populations to increase
with time, no solid evidence that this phenomenon has already
occurred presently exists," and "The low level of seropositivity
followed by relatively low numbers of incident cases in the following
seasons indicates that other factors besides population immunity are
at work."
Further speculation about the future course of the West Nile virus
epidemic in the Western Hemisphere would be unwise at this stage. -
