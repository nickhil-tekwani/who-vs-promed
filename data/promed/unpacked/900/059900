The mosquito-borne disease called eastern equine encephalitis [EEE]
has been confirmed for the 2nd time this year [2011]. Wisconsin State
Veterinarian Dr Bob Ehlenfeldt says EEE has struck 2 horses in 2
different north central Wisconsin counties.

Blood samples from a 7-year-old American quarter horse in Price County
and a 6-year-old Belgian mare in Taylor County were submitted to
Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory this month [August 2011],
where both showed signs of neurological disease. Neither had been
vaccinated for EEE.

"Vaccinate your horses if you haven't already, or get boosters for
those you vaccinated earlier in the year," Dr Ehlenfeldt says. "EEE
has a mortality rate in excess of 90 percent. The vaccine is not
expensive, it's effective, and if we've found EEE in these 3 counties,
it's reasonable to assume it's more widespread. Unless we have a
really early killing frost, we still have a lot of mosquito season
ahead of us."

Ehlenfeldt issued his first warning on 9 Aug 2011 after his office
received notification that 2 llamas in Dunn County had died from EEE,
and a horse on the same farm had been sickened. Rarely, humans may
also contract EEE, but no human cases have appeared in Wisconsin.

In addition to vaccination, Ehlenfeldt advised owners can take steps
to reduce their animals' exposure to mosquitoes. They should eliminate
standing water by removing objects like old tires or even the folds in
tarps where water collects, and frequently changing water in water
troughs, bird baths, and similar containers. If possible, owners
should also keep their animals inside barns from dusk through dawn,
when mosquitoes are most active.

EEE is caused by a virus that may be transmitted by mosquito bite to
horses, birds, and humans. The virus is not transmitted between
animals or between animals and humans. Vaccines are available that
protect against other strains of equine encephalitis along with EEE,
and a separate West Nile virus vaccine is also available. WNV is also
mosquito-borne.

[This article offers excellent advice on cleaning up areas that may be
breeding areas for mosquitoes.

A vaccine is available for horses and should be used. It has been said
that the equine vaccine, while it may not be approved for llamas, is
effective. - Mod.TG]
