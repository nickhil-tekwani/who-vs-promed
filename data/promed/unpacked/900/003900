1st report of frosty pod rot (moniliasis disease) caused by
_Moniliophthora roreri_ on cacao in Belize

publication 21 Oct 2005.
_Moniliophthora roreri_ (Mr) causes frosty pod rot (FPR), a highly
destructive cacao disease, currently found in 11 countries in South
and Central America. In Belize, the disease was 1st detected during a
field visit to a small farm in the village of Maya Mopan, Stann Creek
District in September 2004.
Symptoms characteristic of typical FPR included pod deformation,
premature ripening and chocolate-colored pod lesions with
creamy-colored mycelium becoming darker as the spores mature.
Internal pod tissues showed a typical necrotic compact mass
surrounded by a decayed watery substance. The presence of mummies
(dehydrated, sporulated pods), the high disease incidence --
estimated at 60 percent of the pods affected -- and the extent of FPR
within the plantation all suggested that FPR had been present for at
least 6 months.
Mr was grown in modified V8 medium and the morphology of isolates
examined. Colonies showed an initial whitish growth, later
salmon-cream and finally dark brown due to the massive spore
formation. Spores were produced in chains and were thick-walled, pale
yellow, brown en masse, heteromorphic, but most frequently
globose/subglobose (59 percent) to ellipsoid (34 percent), with
maximum dimensions of 5-11 x 8-20 micrometers. These observations
agree with the description of Mr given by Cifferi & Parodi (1933) and
Evans (1981).
Further confirmation was obtained by amplifying and sequencing 2
regions of the nuclear ribosomal DNA repeat-internal transcribed
spacer region (ITS) and 28S large subunit (LSU) with fungal specific
primers ITS1-F/ITS4 (ITS) and LSU4-B/LR6 (Aime & Phillips-Mora,
2005). The sequences obtained (GenBank accessions DQ222927 and
DQ222928) were identical (100 percent homologous) to those of
isolates from Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Honduras, that form a
proposed Mesoamerican subgroup of Mr. The causal agent was deposited
with the U.S. National Fungus Collection (BPI) as MCA2954. Following
the initial discovery, FPR was detected in one additional farm in
Maya Mopan in October 2004, and in 3 farms in the village of San
Felipe (Toledo District) in April 2005.
This is the 1st report of FPR disease in Belize.

[2 major fungal species, witches' broom [WB] caused by _Crinipellis
perniciosa_ and frosty pod rot [FPR] caused by _Moniliophthora
roreri_ (FPR), formerly _Monilia roreri_, have been advancing
steadily through cacao plantations in the Americas and the Caribbean
for over a decade. In an attempt to stop the spread and prevent
transmission to Africa, an international team of cacao researchers is
attempting to establish quarantine zones and creating new
fungal-resistant varieties. WB shrivels them, and FPR leaves them
swollen and white. However, the end result is the same: no cocoa
beans to harvest. There is currently no effective control against
these fungal diseases.
Of the 2 fungi, FPR is the hardier species, with spores that can
travel further in hot, dry conditions. When it entered Peru in 1991,
it wiped out 75 percent of cacao production in less than 2 years, and
it continues to invade new territories at alarming speeds and is now
believed to have reached Brazil, where the World Cocoa Foundation
estimates it could reduce production in the region by 20 percent in
the next decade. To prevent the northern spread of FPR, attempts were
made to establish quarantine zones in Central America, but
unfortunately, it is now present in southern Mexico.
In the absence of other solutions, these fungal diseases will
continue to spread in the Americas until resistant material becomes
available. But, with the right procedures in place, Africa should
continue to FPR-free. Schnell says the quarantine systems are secure,
and diseases like frosty pod and witches' broom are unlikely to make
it through. Smuggling of plants is one possible way that FPR or
witches' broom could spread. This is potentially disastrous because,
as he notes, "It would take 6 months or a year for the disease to
establish itself, and by then it's too late to do anything."
The most economical way of controlling FPR spread is to eliminate
inoculum sources, which are dead sporulating pods, with frequent
harvests on regular cycles. Other practices should include reduction
of tree height (maximum 3.5 m) to facilitate removal of diseased
pods, biological control, and planting of resistant or tolerant
cultivars as they become available.
