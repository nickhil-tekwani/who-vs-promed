CDC: Norovirus to blame for sick campers at Notre Dame
------------------------------------------------
St. Joseph County Health Officer Dr. Thomas A. Felgerhas announced that laboratory tests have confirmed norovirus infection as the cause of the gastrointestinal outbreak that affected 106 students attending a sport camp at the University of Notre Dame earlier this week. 29 of those students were treated and released from local emergency departments for the intestinal illness.

Norovirus is a very contagious virus, and is the most common "stomach bug" in the United States. Norovirus can be spread by an infected person, contaminated food or water, or by touching contaminated surfaces. Symptoms of norovirus infection usually occur 12-48 hours after exposure, and include diarrhea, stomach pain, nausea, and vomiting. Most people recover in 1-3 days, but remain contagious for up to 2 weeks after recovery.

Hand washing is the most effective way to prevent the spread of norovirus infection. Wash hands with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds, and be sure to wash hands after using the bathroom, after changing a diaper, after taking care of someone else who is sick, and before eating or preparing/handling food. After throwing up or having diarrhea, immediately clean and disinfect contaminated surface using a chlorine bleach solution with a concentration of 1000-5000 ppm (5-25 tablespoons of household bleach per gallon of water) or other disinfectant registered as effective against Norovirus by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Those who are ill should stay home, preferably at least 3 days after symptoms resolve.

The St. Joseph County Health Department will continue to work with the University of Notre Dame and the Indiana State Department of Health to gather and disseminate information. Additional information about Norovirus can be found on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website.

Health authorities are also investigating a suspected norovirus outbreak among girls attending a cheerleading camp at Davenport University in Grand Rapids.

[ProMED-mail no longer routinely reports outbreaks of norovirus infection. These outbreaks are generally characterised by sudden onset and rapid resolution, often before the information can be disseminated usefully. Outbreaks are commonest in winter when people congregate indoors, hence the alternate name "winter-vomitting bug". The above report illustrates, however, that outbreaks of norovirus infection can occur at any time of year and in any social environment

According to the CDC (http://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/about/overview.html) norovirus infection is the most common cause of acute gastroenteritis in the United States. Each year, it causes about 21 million illnesses and contributes to about 70 000 hospitalizations and 800 deaths. Norovirus is also the most common cause of foodborne-disease outbreaks in the United States.
