A farm in Chiayi yesterday [13 Feb 2017] became the nation's latest poultry farm to test positive for the highly pathogenic H5N6 avian influenza virus strain.

Comprehensive test results should be available today [14 Feb 2017], the Chiayi County Department of Agriculture said, adding that county inspectors found contaminated chickens at an unlicensed butcher's shop in a traditional market.

The news came after a turkey farm in Tainan was on Sunday [12 Feb 2017] confirmed to have H5N6-infected birds, following the 1st confirmed H5N6 infection in the nation last week at a poultry farm in Hualien County and a case in Yilan County on Saturday [11 Feb 2017].

Later yesterday [13 Feb 2017], another poultry farm in Hualien was also declared infected.

A case of H5N2 contamination was confirmed at a chicken farm in the county's Taisi Township, Yulin County Animal and Plant Disease Control Center Director Liao Pei-chung said separately yesterday [13 Feb 2017].

The confirmation resulted in the culling of 3900 chickens, bringing the total number of birds culled in the county to more than 130 000 so far this year [2017], he said, adding that the authorities then disinfected nearby areas to prevent the spread of the virus.

The Cabinet on Sunday [12 Feb 2017] established a Central Epidemic Response Center.

The center held its 1st meeting yesterday [13 Feb 2017], during which Premier Lin Chuan called on local governments to work with the central government to make preparations and adopt measures to contain the disease. He added that if the outbreak continues, the cabinet would take further measures, such as imposing border or movement controls.

Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Deputy Director-General Chuang Jen-hsiang yesterday [13 Feb 2017] urged people to avoid visiting live poultry markets or poultry farms and not to eat raw eggs to avoid H5N6 infections. However, Chuang said humans can only become infected with the virus if a person is exposed to an environment where the virus is active, so only poultry farmers and personnel culling the infected animals are now at risk.

The centers have been working closely with the Council of Agriculture and local health bureaus since 5 Feb 2017 to ensure that personnel who are responsible for culling and disposal of carcasses wear protective clothing and N95 surgical masks, he said.

All personnel connected with the recent cases have been monitored by the centers for possible infection, Chuang said, adding that aside from checking on such personnel every day, the centers have also instructed medical facilities to ask patients with flu-like symptoms whether they had been near poultry carcasses.

The centers have prepared 1.97 million N95 surgical masks, 510 000 sets of protective clothing and about 45 million other types of surgical masks to serve as disease prevention equipment, Chuang said.

The Taipei Department of Environmental Protection yesterday [13 Feb 2017] warned the public not to feed wild birds, adding that the maximum fine for feeding wild birds is TWD 6000 [USD 194.3].

The department would be monitoring areas in the city such as the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall complex and Daan Forest Park, which usually attract flocks of wild birds, department official Yang Wei-hsiu said.

The Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) caucus yesterday [13 Feb 2017] called a news conference demanding that the central government make the "maximum effort" to prevent a national outbreak. The situation is "a matter of national security," KMT Legislator Alicia Wang said, urging the government to remain on guard, as farmers might conceal incidents of contamination at their facilities.

[Following its 1st confirmation in Taiwan (in a wild goose) on 5 Feb 2017 (see 20170206.4820215), the newly introduced HPAI H5N6 virus strain infected a commercial poultry (ducks) farm situated within 3 km from the affected wild goose (reported to the OIE on 12 Feb 2017; see 20170213.4836200). According to the current media report, HPAI H5N6 seems since to be spreading within Taiwan's poultry farms.

Previously, another 3 HPAI strains were recorded as circulating in Taiwan, namely HPAI H5N2, H5N3, and H5N8.

WHO's most recent monthly risk assessment (Influenza at the Human-Animal Interface) was published on 16 Jan 2017; it is available at http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/Influenza_Summary_IRA_HA_interface_01_16_2017_FINAL.pdf?ua=1.

The 1st human case of infection with an A(H5N6) virus is considered to have affected a child in China in February 2014 (subtyped retrospectively a year later). Sporadic cases followed on mainland China's territory. - Mod.AS
