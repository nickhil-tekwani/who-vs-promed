New bird flu outbreak confirmed along Thai-Lao border
-----------------------------------------------
The H5N1 bird flu virus has been found in the Thai northeast,
bordering Laos, prompting culling of 310 000 hens after the virus
killed a teenager elsewhere in the country last week, the Agriculture
Ministry said on Sunday [30 Jul 2006].
"The lab results confirmed last night chickens from a village in
Nakohn Panom province have died of bird flu," Vice Agriculture
Minister Charal Trinwuthipong told Reuters.
"The culling on all 78 farms has already begun, and we hope to finish
them all by tonight," he said.
Charal said the outbreak in Nakohn Panom, 740 km (460 miles)
northeast of Bangkok, might be caused by H5N1-infected egg trays
taken from "the other side" of the border, in an apparent reference to Laos.
"These egg merchants were too lazy to swap eggs from their trays to
those of their customers'. They just swapped the trays and that's how
the disease spread to the village," he said.
A 17-year-old man died of bird flu on Monday [24 Jul 2006] in the
northern province of Phichit, where authorities have slaughtered
hundreds of birds and restricted poultry movement in a bid to stamp
out Thailand's 1st outbreak in 8 months.
The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said on Friday [28
Jul 2006] the deadly virus was also found on a poultry farm in Laos,
the country's 1st major outbreak since 2004.
The outbreak occurred on a commercial farm 25 km (15 miles) south of
Vientiane, where about 2500 chickens died last week, according to
state media reports.
The same farm experienced an outbreak in early 2004, when the virus
swept through parts of Asia, including Communist-led Laos, where most
of its 5.6 million people live in remote rural areas.
The FAO was due to send a bird flu expert to Laos on Tuesday [1 Aug
2006] to assess the situation, an FAO official said.
Charal said the ministry instructed governors of provinces bordering
Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar to step up surveillance on animals
transferred from these countries, where basic health care barely
exists outside urban areas.
