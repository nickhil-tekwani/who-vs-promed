FDA CLEARS NEW TEST FOR LYME DISEASE
The Food and Drug Administration has cleared a simple, new blood test for
Lyme disease that can be used in a doctor's office. The test provides
results in an hour at the point of care, compared to the standard
laboratory tests which have to be performed in a lab, delaying test
results. This means doctors will be able to make a probable diagnosis
quicker and start treatment with antibiotics immediately.
The test, the PreVue B. burgdorferi Antibody Detection Assay, is intended
to be used as the first step in testing people suspected of having Lyme
disease. Positive results must be confirmed with a Western blot test done
by a laboratory. Two-stage testing is recommended by the Centers for
Disease Control. Lyme disease is a bacterial infection spread to humans
primarily by tick bite. It is the most common insect-borne infectious
disease in North America and is a significant public health concern. The
infectious agent in the disease is the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi.
Lyme disease may have many different manifestations. It starts with a
large, red rash at the site of the tick bite. Then flu-like symptoms may
set in. It may affect the nervous system, and, in later stage, may be
manifest by persistent arthritis. Diagnosing Lyme disease can be
challenging because the symptoms of flu, fatigue and joint pain are similar
to those of a number of other conditions. The new test, made by Chembio
Diagnostic Systems of Medford, N.Y., uses antigenic proteins developed by
recombinant DNA techniques rather than the whole cell B. burgdorferi
preparations used in current laboratory tests. Antigenic proteins developed
by recombinant DNA techniques allow for more accuracy.
FDA's clearance of the PreVue test was based on results of clinical studies
conducted by the manufacturer at clinics and physician offices. PreVue
accurately detected Lyme disease in 72 percent of one group of 120 blood
samples, and 95 percent of another group of 42 blood samples. The test
incorrectly identified Lyme disease in three percent of 100 blood samples
in which it was not present. This "false-positive" rate is similar to that
of laboratory tests for Lyme disease.
