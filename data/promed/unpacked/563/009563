Suspected rabies outbreak in Eastern Cape
-----------------------------------------
The Eastern Cape Department of Health officials were attending to a
suspected rabies outbreak in Mgwenyane village near Libode on Friday 16 Jan
2009, the department said. Spokesperson Sizwe Kupelo said the department
had dispatched an outbreak team to the village after at least 8 people were
bitten by 2 dogs in the village.

One of the dogs attacked its owner and then bit 5 other people before
running away. The other dog bit 2 people and also ran away. The dogs were
believed to have fled into a nearby forest. All the people who had been
bitten were identified and taken to a nearby hospital where they were being
treated for dog bites and receiving anti-rabies medication.

The outbreak team was on the scene informing people to treat all dogs in
the area with suspicion. "We are urging those who had been bitten to come
forward and be treated with immediate effect," Kupelo said. The suspected
outbreak was reported to the Eastern Cape Department of Agriculture. The
Department was responsible for immunising dogs in the area and would help
with further investigations. Kupelo said that the Department only suspected
that the dogs suffered from rabies but that further investigation would
reveal the facts. The ages of the people bitten ranged from 4 to 66 years old.

In an unrelated incident, the Department of Health dispatched an ambulance
to the village of Mhlanganisweni near Libode after receiving a report that
5 boys were in a critical condition after being initiated. The report from
a member of the community said that the boys needed urgent medical
attention. They would be taken to a nearby hospital. Since last December
[2008], 12 boys had died from botched circumcisions and "thousands" had
been rescued by police and health officials over the last few months,
Kupelo said.

[Although the diagnosis of rabies virus infection has not been confirmed by
laboratory tests, it is highly probable that the diagnosis will be
confirmed in view of the frequency of reports of rabies from this province
of South Africa. That said, this report suggests that the risk of
contracting rabies virus infection from feral dogs may be of no greater
concern than some of the social practices prevalent in the region.
