New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks: Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Stanislaus County, Stanislaus, California
Date of start of the outbreak: 19 Jan 2015
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds / 145 000 / - / 4500 / 1200 / -
Affected population: A commercial turkey operation. Only one house of 9000 birds on the facility has been affected and showing increased mortality.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]:
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Birds / ** / 3.10 / ** / **
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter
** Not calculated because of missing information

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: contact with wild species

Epidemiological comment: The USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), in conjunction with State Departments of Agriculture and Wildlife, are continuing to conduct a comprehensive epidemiological investigation and enhanced surveillance (including wild bird surveillance of hunter harvested birds) in response to the HPAI H5N8 and H5N2 wild bird related events. Novel avian influenza virus of Eurasian origin (EA-H5N8 clade 2.3.4.4) spread rapidly along wild bird migratory pathways during 2014. Introduction of this EA-H5N8 virus into the Pacific Flyway sometime during 2014 has allowed mixing with North American (AM) lineage viruses and generated new combinations with genes from both EA and AM origin (or "reassortant" viruses), such as the EA/AM H5N2-reassortant detected in Canada and the US. These findings are not unexpected as the EA-H5N8 virus continues to circulate. The EA H5 clade 2.3.4.4 viruses are highly pathogenic for poultry. The detection of the HPAI H5N8 in the commercial turkey flock is considered to be related to the recent avian influenza events in wild birds. The partial HA/NA sequences are over 99 percent similar to A/gyrfalcon/WA/41088-6/2014 based upon direct sequencing from swabs of 2 different turkeys. The commercial turkey premises is in a remote location and has been quarantined. Comprehensive epidemiological investigation and enhanced surveillance is being conducted. Additional recent testing of other turkey houses on the premises has been negative for avian influenza.

Control measures
Measures applied: stamping out; quarantine; movement control inside the country; disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Birds / real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 23 Jan 2015 / Positive
Birds / virus sequencing / 23 Jan 2015 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[2] Press release, HPAI H5N8 USDA-APHIS
Date: Sat 24 Jan 2015 (last modified)

"The United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has confirmed the presence of highly pathogenic (HPAI) H5N8 avian influenza in a commercial turkey flock in Stanislaus County, California. This is the 1st finding of HPAI in commercial poultry during the ongoing disease incident in the Pacific Flyway. No human cases of these avian influenza viruses have been detected in the United States, Canada, or internationally, and there continues to be no public health concern.

Samples from the flock, which experienced increased mortality, were tested at the California Animal Health & Food Safety Laboratory System (CAHFS), and the APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa confirmed the finding. APHIS is partnering closely with the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA), which has quarantined the facility. APHIS and CDFA have initiated an incident command response, and APHIS will assist CDFA in depopulating the remaining birds on the property to prevent the spread of the disease. Birds from the involved flock will not enter the food system.

H5N8 has not been shown to present a health risk to the public. As a reminder, the proper handling and cooking of poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 F [73 C] kills bacteria and viruses.

Federal and state partners are working jointly on additional surveillance and testing in the nearby area, following existing avian influenza response plans. These plans also will include preventing the movement of risky animals or products out of the immediate area to prevent further disease spread. The United States has the strongest AI surveillance program in the world, and USDA is working with its partners to actively look for the disease in commercial poultry operations, live bird markets, and in migratory wild bird populations.

USDA will be notifying the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) of this detection as part of USDA's ongoing reporting of all HPAI findings. USDA also continues to communicate with trading partners to encourage adherence to OIE standards and minimize trade impacts. OIE trade guidelines call on countries to base trade restrictions on sound science and, whenever possible, limit restrictions to those animals and animal products within a defined region that pose a risk of spreading disease of concern.

These virus strains can travel in wild birds without them appearing sick. People should avoid contact with sick/dead poultry or wildlife. If contact occurs, wash your hands with soap and water and change clothing before having any contact with healthy domestic poultry and birds.

All bird owners, whether commercial producers or backyard enthusiasts, should continue to practice good biosecurity, prevent contact between their birds and wild birds, and to report sick birds or unusual bird deaths to State/Federal officials, either through your state veterinarian or through USDA's toll-free number at 1-866-536-75931. Additional information on biosecurity for backyard flocks can be found at http://healthybirds.aphis.usda.gov/.

Avian influenza (AI) is caused by an influenza type A virus which can infect poultry (such as chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quail, domestic ducks, geese, and guinea fowl) and is carried by free flying waterfowl such as ducks, geese and shorebirds. AI viruses are classified by a combination of 2 groups of proteins: hemagglutinin or "H" proteins, of which there are 16 (H1-H16), and neuraminidase or "N" proteins, of which there are 9 (N1-N9). Many different combinations of "H" and "N" proteins are possible. Each combination is considered a different subtype and can be further broken down into different strains. AI viruses are further classified by their pathogenicity (low or high), the ability of a particular virus strain to produce disease in domestic chickens.

The H5N8 virus originated in Asia and spread rapidly along wild bird migratory pathways during 2014, including the Pacific flyway. In the Pacific flyway, the H5N8 virus has mixed with North American avian influenza viruses, creating new mixed-origin viruses. These mixed-origin viruses contain the Asian-origin H5 part of the virus, which is highly pathogenic to poultry. The N parts of these viruses came from North American low pathogenic avian influenza viruses.

USDA has identified 2 mixed-origin viruses in the Pacific Flyway: the H5N2 virus and a new H5N1 virus. The new H5N1 virus is NOT the same virus as the H5N1 virus found in Asia, Europe and Africa that has caused some human illness. Detailed analysis of the virus is underway in cooperation with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. None of these viruses have been identified in humans, nor are expected to pose a public health risk.
