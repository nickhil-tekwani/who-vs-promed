So far, 6 cases of campylobacteriosis have been linked to the consumption of unpasteurized (raw) milk at Low Sizergh Barn Farm, Kendal [South Lakeland, Cumbria]. South Lakeland District Council's (SLDC's) environmental health officers are supporting the investigation, which is being led by the Food Standards Agency (FSA). Inquiries are ongoing but experts believe the most likely cause of the outbreak is consumption of raw milk, probably from a vending machine on the site. The business owner is helping with inquiries and in the meantime has voluntarily agreed to suspend the sales of raw milk to the public.

_Campylobacter_ is the most common cause of food poisoning in the UK. The bacteria are usually found on raw or undercooked meat (particularly poultry), unpasteurized milk, and untreated water. The incubation period (the time between eating contaminated food and the start of symptoms) for food poisoning caused by _Campylobacter_ is usually between 2 and 5 days, but can be up to 10 days. The symptoms usually last less than a week. Although not usually serious in healthy adults, it can be more serious in young children or someone vulnerable to the effects of dehydration, such as the elderly and those with a pre-existing health condition.

Anyone who may have consumed raw milk from Low Sizergh Barn and thinks they may have campylobacteriosis should contact a health professional if their symptoms are severe or don't start to improve in a few days. If they have recently purchased raw milk from the site they are being advised not to drink it.

A spokesman for SLDC said: "The number of confirmed cases is small but it is important that we let people know about the situation in case others have been affected. The FSA is leading on the ongoing investigation at the farm and they are working to ensure measures are in place to prevent the public consuming unsafe products. Unpasteurized milk was removed from sale at the premises as soon as the results were confirmed."

[In the March 2012 issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases (Langer AJ, Ayers T, Grass J, et al: Nonpasteurized dairy products, disease outbreaks, and state laws -- United States, 1993-2006. Emerg Infect Dis. 2012; 18(3): 385-91 http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/3/11-1370_article), the authors report on 121 foodborne outbreaks (with 4413 cases of reported illness) caused by contaminated dairy products, and 73 (60 percent) were involved with unpasteurized dairy products. 65 (54 percent) involved cheese (42 percent made from unpasteurized milk) and 56 involved fluid milk (82 percent involved unpasteurized milk). In these outbreaks, _Campylobacter_ spp was responsible for 54 percent of the outbreaks, followed by _Salmonella_ spp (22 percent), enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (13 percent), _Brucella_ spp (4 percent), _Listeria_ (4 percent), and _Shigella_ spp (3 percent).

Clearly, pasteurized milk can also transmit disease, and 48 outbreaks were reported. The source of contamination was reported in only 7 (14 percent), of which at least 4 resulted from post-pasteurization contamination by an infected food handler.

The reader is directed to the article for additional information and discussion.

Classical zoonotic organisms such as _Brucella abortus_, _Brucella melitensis_, _Mycobacterium bovis_, _Salmonella_ species, _Listeria monocytogenes_, _Campylobacter_ species, _Yersinia_ species, _Coxiella burnetii_, and _E. coli_ O157:H7 are associated with the ingestion of raw milk. Non-zoonotic organisms such as _Streptococcus pyogenes_, _Salmonella_ Typhi, _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, _Shigella_ spp, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi A, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi B, enterotoxins from _Staphylococcus aureus_, and hepatitis A have also been associated with the ingestion of raw milk. - Mod.LL
