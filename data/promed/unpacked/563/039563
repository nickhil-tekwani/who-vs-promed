H5N1 virus may be adapting to pigs in Indonesia
-----------------------------------------------
Scientists report that H5N1 avian influenza viruses may be adapting
to pigs, as evidenced by the finding that H5N1 viruses isolated from
pigs in Indonesia were less harmful to mice than were H5N1 viruses
from chickens.

The finding suggests that in growing in pigs, the virus may have
become less harmful to mammals in general, the authors report. That
sounds reassuring, but the authors say it may mean the virus is one
step closer to turning into a human pandemic strain.

In the study, scientists from Japan and Indonesia collected viruses
from chickens and pigs in Indonesia, grew them in laboratory cell
cultures, and used them to infect mice. They found that the viruses
from pigs were less lethal to mice than the viruses from chickens,
according to their recent report in the Archives of Virology.

"We found that swine isolates were less virulent to mice than avian
isolates, suggesting that the viruses became attenuated during their
replication in pigs," the report states.

Pigs are seen as a possible intermediate host that can help avian flu
viruses adapt to humans, because the epithelial cells in pigs'
trachea can be infected by both avian and human flu viruses, the
article notes. If avian and human viruses infected a pig at the same
time, they could mix or reassort, giving rise to a novel strain that
might be able to spread in humans. The flu pandemics of 1957-58 and
1968-69 were caused by avian-human hybrid viruses, though it is not
known if they arose in pigs.

But even if they don't mix with human strains, avian flu viruses that
infect pigs are believed capable of adapting to them -- gaining the
capability to grow efficiently in swine cells -- and thereby adapting
to other mammals, the authors write. Humans occasionally are infected
with swine flu viruses, something that has been reported at least
twice this flu season in the United States, according to the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention.

So far, H5N1 infections in pigs have been reported rarely or gone
unnoticed because infected pigs show no signs of illness, the
scientists write. But the authors, who include Chairul Nidom of
Airlangga University in Surabaya, Indonesia, report that they found
H5N1 infections in pigs in Indonesia in 2005, 2006, and 2007. They
determined that the swine viruses were closely related to viruses in
chickens found nearby, indicating H5N1 spread from chickens to pigs
at least 3 different times.

They gathered 3 viruses from pigs and 2 from chickens on East Java in
2006 and 2007. They first determined that all the viruses grew well
in embryonated eggs and in cultures of canine kidney cells,
demonstrating that both avian and swine strains could grow in
mammalian cell cultures. They then infected groups of mice with a
range of doses of the 5 isolates.

The results showed that all 3 pig viruses were less virulent in mice
than the chicken viruses were, as measured by how large a dose it
took to kill half of the mice. Two of the pig isolates were "strongly
attenuated" in mice.

In a genetic analysis, the scientists found several amino acid
differences that might explain the lower virulence of the swine
isolates, but they "were unable to determine which mutations were
strongly correlated to low virulence in mice because these mutations
are frequently found among avian and human H5N1 viruses," the report says.

The authors offer this interpretation of their findings: "Since our
swine strains were isolated from pigs with no apparent influenza-like
symptoms, the decrease of pathogenicity in mice suggests that the
H5N1 viruses may have lost their pathogenicity in mammals during
replication in pigs. Given that for the H5N1 viruses to cause a
pandemic, they would likely become attenuated in humans, becoming
attenuated in mammals may be a prelude to the generation of a pandemic strain."

They add that because H5N1 infections in swine increase the risk that
a pandemic strain could emerge, the findings point up the need for
"continuous surveillance and management of H5N1 viruses in pigs."

The findings may mean that H5N1 viruses from swine will be less
virulent in mammals generally, but it's not clear that the viruses
have truly adapted to swine, said Richard Webby, PhD, a virologist,
flu researcher, and associate member of the Department of Infectious
Diseases at St Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis.

Noting that the study authors used only 5 isolates, Webby said,
"Trying to make too much of a conclusion from that number would be
premature. The 2 least lethal viruses were both from swine, but one
[swine isolate] was lethal. So perhaps if these become adapted to
mammals, they're potentially going to be less pathogenic."

Whether H5N1 viruses become more or less virulent when they adapt to
mammals is a very important question, he said, adding that the
findings "might be to some extent reassuring."

Regarding the authors' statement that attenuation of the virus in
mammals might be a prelude to the development of a pandemic strain,
Webby commented, "I guess the thought behind that is that for a
pathogen to be successful, it's got to transmit readily, so if it
makes the host too sick, so they go to a hospital or die, the chances
of its transmitting to someone else are reduced."

But Webby told CIDRAP News that it's not clear that H5N1 viruses have
really become established in swine anywhere. "If these viruses have
gone into swine, I think the key is whether they become established
in swine. If that happened, we'd be concerned. I think the consensus
now is that pigs are like humans; they can be infected, but it's
unlikely there'd be a lot of transmission."
He said US Department of Agriculture researchers have infected pigs
with H5N1 viruses and found that the viruses didn't grow at all. But
those researchers used viruses that didn't come from pigs in the 1st
place. He noted that pigs often are fed broken eggs or even chicken
carcasses, and such pigs might carry the virus in their snouts
without becoming truly infected.

Webby suggested that researchers now should "put these swine viruses
back into swine and see if they actually are more adapted to swine
than the avian viruses."

[The paper by Ryo Takano and 8 colleagues (Archives of Virology
0304-8608), on which the CIDRAP commentary is based, is a brief
account of investigation of the properties of several avian A/H5N1
influenza viruses which have been isolated from swine in Indonesia.
The authors' conclusion that swine isolates are less virulent for
mice than avian isolates, suggesting that the viruses became
attenuated during their replication in pigs, is well supported by
biological and molecular data. However the significance of their
findings is difficult to evaluate. It appears that H5N1 viruses have
been isolated repeatedly from asymptomatic domesticated pigs both In
Indonesia and Viet Nam. It is not known whether adaptation to pigs
makes avian viruses able to replicate in other mammalian hosts. In
this paper there is no information about the relative infectivity of
these viruses in swine. The biological data presented comprise assays
in eggs, mammalian cell (MDCK) cultures, and laboratory mice.

These data are interesting and relevant but still fall short of
substantiating the persistent hypothesis that swine may function as
"mixing vessels" facilitating the generation of pandemic virus. - Mod.CP]
