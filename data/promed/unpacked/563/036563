Health personnel in nearby Koronadal City in South Cotabato have launched massive fogging operations in 2 villages in the area due to the rising cases of suspected chikungunya disease.

Dr Jean Genevieve Aturdido, acting Koronadal City health officer, said the fogging operations are focused on parts of Barangays San Roque and Saravia where cases of the mosquito-borne chikungunya have been increasing. She said the city government directed the conduct of fogging operations to help prevent the disease from spreading to other areas. "This is part of the intervention measures that we've adopted to help contain the disease," the official said. Aturdido said the fogging operations presently cover all 14 puroks in Barangay San Roque and portions of Sitio Badak and Purok Damsite in Saravia.

Aside from the fogging operations, she said their office is conducting regular surveillance and treatment, as well as information and awareness activities regarding the disease in the affected areas.

As of Wednesday [24 Jul 2013], she said their monitoring showed that the number of residents in Barangay San Roque who have showed symptoms of chikungunya already reached around 250. She said some of these cases were confirmed chikungunya [virus] infections based on tests conducted on the blood samples of the patients.

But Aturdido pointed out that while the number of suspected infections has been increasing, the recovery rate among patients is currently at 90 per cent.

In Barangay Saravia, she said they have so far monitored around 30 suspected chikungunya infections in its 2 communities. She said they have taken blood samples from some of the patients for the chikungunya confirmatory tests.

According to the World Health Organization's (WHO) Media Centre, chikungunya is a viral disease that is spread by mosquitoes and causes fever and severe joint pain. Other symptoms include muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue and rash. The disease, WHO said, "shares some clinical signs with dengue, and can be misdiagnosed in areas where dengue is common." It added that there is "no cure for the disease. Treatment is focused on relieving the symptoms. The proximity of mosquito breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for chikungunya," it said.

Last week [week of 15 Jul 2013], the barangay council of San Roque declared the area under a state of calamity due to the rising chikungunya cases in the area. Barangay San Roque is located at the boundary of Koronadal City and Tampakan town, where the initial chikungunya cases were detected in early June [2013]. The entire municipality of Tampakan was placed under a state of calamity last 9 Jul [2012?] due to the rising chikungunya cases that then reached 306.

The South Cotabato Integrated Provincial Health Office (IPHO) earlier pointed to the banana plantations in Tampakan as the possible breeding places of mosquitoes that carry the chikungunya virus.

Aturdido said they could not recommend yet the declaration of the state of calamity in Barangay Saravia as the suspected chikungunya disease was only detected this week. She said such declaration may only be made if the blood samples taken from patients will turn out positive of the disease. "The confirmatory tests will take about a week to process. After that we will make an assessment if there's a need to recommend the placement of the area under the state of calamity," she added.

[There have been several outbreaks of chikungunya virus infections in various localities in the Philippines this year (2013). The chikungunya outbreak in South Cotabato province continues and is spreading. The main mosquito vector in the outbreak areas above is _Aedes aegypti_, which breeds in and immediately around houses and other buildings. Fogging is of limited value. Reduction of breeding sites would have more effect in reducing vector mosquito populations.

At least 179 people from 4 villages in San Nicolas, Ilocos Norte [province] have been diagnosed with what is believed to be symptoms of chikungunya disease, health authorities reported on Thursday [25 Jul 2013]. Dr Leoneil Obien, municipal health officer of San Nicolas, said the residents with suspected chikungunya fever came from barangays San Marcos, Bugnay, San Agustin, and San Pablo.

Obien said health workers are still collecting blood samples from patients to be submitted to the regional office of the Department of Health (DOH) in San Fernando City, La Union to confirm that chikungunya is the disease. "As of this time, we are not yet sure of the cause of the illness of our residents," he said.

Obien said health authorities are presently conducting intensified advocacy campaign on cleanliness and sanitation in every household in the different barangays to contain the possible spread of any disease-causing microorganism.

Symptoms of chikungunya disease include skin rashes, pain in the lower back, joint pain with or without the presence of swelling, nausea, headaches, chills, and fever.

Chikungunya [virus] is transmitted to humans by _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes, the same carrier of dengue [viruses]. The incubation period of the disease is from 2 to 6 days with symptoms of post-infection usually appearing from 4 to 7 days.

Medical specialists reported that there is no specific treatment for chikungunya fever yet.

Meanwhile, San Nicolas Vice Mayor Alfredo P Valdez Jr, a physician, expressed alarm over the disease even as he admitted that he too experienced some symptoms of chikungunya [virus infection] a few days ago but he immediately recovered.

Among several steps recommended by health authorities here to prevent infection include the use of insect repellent, protective clothing, and staying in areas with screens.
