Slovenian veterinary services confirmed on Friday [17 Oct 2008]
reports about the deaths of 4 cows caused by anthrax but insisted
that there were no reasons for panic after having taken necessary
measures. The 4 cows belong to a farmer from the village of Zice near
Slovenske Konjice in northeastern Slovenia, the Slovenian news agency
STA reported.

"From the moment that the test proved anthrax, we carried out all the
basic measures. We delivered the disinfectant; transport of animals
and manure and sale of fodder were forbidden, and we also provided
vaccine and vaccinated the animals," said Slavko Hren, the local
veterinary official in Celje.

The head of the veterinary office in Celje, Andreja Bizjak, said that
in the last 50 years, anthrax cases have been reported in 78 areas in
Slovenia, the last case having been reported in 2001. Bizjak said the
disease could be contracted by humans only when people are in direct
contact with infected meat.

[The disease is certainly sporadically reported in Slovenia. OIE only
has singular reports of bovine outbreaks in 1992 and 2007 for
Slovenia, and for no other species. As a result, there is presently
no routine vaccination and probably no awareness of risk. It would be
useful to know how this outbreak came about. When the disease is this
infrequent, outbreaks occur when old anthrax graves are disturbed by
road building, trenching for new water lines and by similar
engineering activity in pastured areas.

We have no reports for anthrax in this country. - Mod.MHJ]
