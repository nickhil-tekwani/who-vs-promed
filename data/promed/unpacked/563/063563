Hundreds of dead sea birds washed ashore on Unalaska Island over a 2-day
span and scientists are trying to figure out why.
Several hundred shearwaters died after flying into a crabbing boat early
Wednesday morning in Unalaska Bay, said Forrest Bowers, a fisheries
biologist for the state Department of Fish and Game in Unalaska.
The boat captain reported that a hail of shearwaters struck the vessel for
up to 30 minutes, Bowers said. The crew threw the dead and dying birds
overboard. Other boats were in the area and also might have been struck by
the birds.
There have been other reports of such occurrences, but not usually in such
large numbers, according to Bowers.
Seabird specialist Art Sowls at the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife
Refuge in Homer was called in to consult on the deaths. He said shearwaters
can be in flocks of more than a million birds. The birds go through a
moulting process that limits their ability to fly.
"They can fly," he said, "but they are somewhat immobile." Reid Brewer, a
local marine biologist with the University of Alaska Fairbanks, said he
counted more than 1600 bird carcasses on shores near homes in Unalaska and
along beaches outside the Aleutian island community.
He said the birds don't look thin and aren't oiled. Some had necks twisted
as if they had smashed into something.
Starvation would be a far more likely cause for the deaths than a
collision, said David Irons, a seabird authority with the United States
Fish and Wildlife Service. "They don't normally run into ships," he said.
But it is possible, he said, that birds weakened by hunger could have hit
boats or that the carcasses washing ashore could be a combination of birds
that starved and birds that hit ships.
Irons said he expects that the dead birds will be checked for avian flu but
everyone involved with the die-off believes that it is an unlikely cause.

[There are some 25 or more species of birds called shearwaters. They are in
3 different genera, with wide geographic distribution. These birds are
commonly found in cold waters, and in some temperate water climates. The
shearwaters found in the cold waters of Alaska are likely the short-tailed
shearwater (_Puffinus tenuirostris_). They are known for tremendous size of
their flocks.
