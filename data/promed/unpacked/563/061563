While the number of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) has been less in the state of Maharashtra, in comparison to other north Indian states, data shared by the state's health department showed a steady increase in the number of cases in the past 3 years.

While 3 years ago in 2017 [2 years ago?], the number of AES cases was only one and in 2018 there were 48 cases, this year (2019), within 6 months, around 74 cases are already reported in Vidarbha region of the state.

Acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) affects the central nervous system, mostly in children and young adults. It is a viral disease, which causes mild flu-like symptoms such as high fever and headache. Maharashtra's public health department had managed to keep the number of deaths as low as one dead in 2017 and 2018 and zero deaths in 2019.

Looking at the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) data from 2013 till April 2019, there have been only 2 deaths due to AES.

According to Maharashtra's health department, good medical facilities and routine check-ups have reduced the number of Japanese encephalitis (JE+ve) and Chandipura virus cases in the state which constitutes encephalitis illness.

State entomologist Mahendra Jagtap, said, "AES cases are diagnosed as AES known and AES unknown. It can be spread because of different viruses mainly JE+ve. If undetected viruses are diagnosed, we consider to report it in AES unknown category, due to which we can see the number of patients diagnosed have increased in AES." The entomologist rules out consuming litchi as a cause for AES.

[Frequently, in other reports from northeastern states in India, AES is often a mixture of Japanese encephalitis (JE) and other, usually undetermined, etiologies. We do not know what proportion of the 74 AES cases so far this year (2019) are due to JE nor the proportion of cases that are children. There continues to be an increase in cases of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) reported above. There is no indication of what the etiology of those AES cases might be. As noted previously, many times the determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive. Some cases of AES are frequently attributed to JE, but many are of undefined etiology. AES has continued to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heatstroke, lychee fruit consumption, and scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_). A recent publication states that dengue virus is one of the 3 commonest agents identified in AES, but existing surveillance for AES does not include routine testing for dengue. Until the etiology (or etiologies) of these AES cases is determined, effective and efficient prevention of these cases will not be possible.

The very low case fatality rate is remarkable and a good indication that patients are receiving effective medical care. - Mod.TY
