The presence of the BT virus was confirmed by the regional
authorities of the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha in central Spain. The
virus was detected in the blood of asymptomatic cattle in an area
where the vector is also present. Sr Francisco Nicolas, head of the
department of agriculture of the region, confirmed that the virus was
serotype 4.
Analysis carried out in all live animals imported from central Europe
during the 55 days before the confirmation of the first outbreak of
Bluetongue virus serotype 8 in central Europe detected 2 seropositive
cows imported from Holland. The animals were destroyed.

and Morocco, and some graphs dated in the late 1990s representing the

[Dr Pablo Nart has added the following information in regard to the
2006 bluetongue situation in Spain:
"There haven't been any new outbreaks since December 2005, though the
presence of the virus has been detected in sentinel herds during 2006
[as detailed in the above information].
<http://rasve.mapa.es/Publica/noticias/Noticias.asp>
One of the main farmer's unions, the Union de Pequenos Agricultores
(UPA), is pressing the government to expand the vaccination campaign
to all susceptible animals and areas. The UPA published a statement
on 18 Apr 2006 saying that the quantity of 3.5 million vaccine doses
used during the current year, while allowing the movements of animals
to summer pastures, is not sufficient for the prevention of the
disease throughout the entire country.

Incidentally, an animal from Belgium infected with serotype 8 was
detected in Cataluna (northeast Spain) on 28 Sep 2006. The animal was
destroyed and all animals in a 2-km radius have been tested and found
negative. A 20-km surveillance zone has also been established.

The vaccine used in Spain is inactivated BTV-4".
Dr Nart is kindly acknowledged for this useful update.
The continued presence of the virus in Spain underlines the need for
and importance of timely vaccination of the susceptible animals,
prior to the BT disease season (June - December, probably peaking
September-November).
Two BT vaccines are currently permitted for use in Spain; one of them
for sheep and cattle, the other one for sheep only (at
present). Relevant details, including vaccination schemes and
time-table, are available at
