Total of 47 RVF human cases confirmed
-------------------------------------
The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) has confirmed
5 new human laboratory cases of Rift Valley fever (RVF). This pushes
up the number of confirmed cases to 47. Of the 47 confirmed cases on
Wednesday [24 Mar 2010], 41 cases with 2 deaths were reported in the
Free State, 3 in the Eastern Cape [province] and 3 in the Northern
Cape [province].

"Outbreak investigations by the Departments of Health and
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries are ongoing, supported by the
South African Field Epidemiology and Training Programme," said the
Department of Health.

The NICD have also confirmed the spread of RVF in animals in the
North West Province. The department said RVF continues to spread in
sheep, goats and cattle on farms within the Free State, Eastern Cape,
Northern Cape and Gauteng Provinces.

The virus is transmitted by mosquitoes and causes termination of
gestation and deaths of young livestock. Humans become infected from
contact with infected tissues of livestock and less frequently from
mosquito bites. The department has urged people living in the
affected areas to seek medical attention at their nearest health
facilities should they have any symptoms.

[Currently there is an extensive outbreak of Rift Valley fever
affecting livestock in South Africa with animal cases reported on
farms predominantly in the Free State Province, but also in the
Eastern Cape, Northern Cape, Gauteng and Mpumalanga Provinces. As of
15 Mar 2010, there had been 42 human laboratory-confirmed cases
including 2 deaths, with 37 cases (2 fatal) in the Free State
Province, 2 cases in the Northern Cape province and 3 cases in the
Eastern Cape province.

The above report indicates that another 5 human cases have been
confirmed: 4 in the Free State and one in Northern Cape province. No
further fatalities have been reported. The outbreak in livestock
remains centered in the Free State province, but has now spread also
into North West province.

As most human cases of Rift Valley fever are relatively mild and of
short duration, no specific treatment is required for these patients.
For the more severe cases, the predominant treatment is general
supportive therapy. Outbreaks of Rift valley fever in animals can be
prevented by a sustained programme of animal vaccination. Both
modified live attenuated virus and inactivated virus vaccines have
been developed for veterinary use. An inactivated vaccine has been
developed for human use. However, this vaccine is not licensed and is
not commercially available.
