Polio outbreak confirmed in Mali
--------------------------------
A case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been confirmed in Bamako, the capital and largest city of Mali. The country is on high alert after national authorities detected a paralysis case with onset [20 Jul 2015]. The patient is a 19-month-old child of Guinean nationality whose paralysis occurred 7 days prior to the child's arrival in Bamako to seek health care. The last case of wild poliovirus (WPV) in Mali dates back to June 2011 in Goundam, Timbuktu Region.

The current detected virus is genetically linked to a confirmed VDPV detected in Siguiri district, in the Kankan Region of Guinea in August 2014, and has been circulating across international borders for more than 2 years without detection.

The risk of spread of this virus is deemed high and it has the capacity to cause paralytic disease in humans or kill. The emergence and circulation of VDPV2 reveals low population immunity against the virus due to low rates of vaccination coverage in Guinea. Consequently, oral polio vaccine (OPV) must be administered multiple times to stop the outbreak and protect children.

The Ministries of Health in both countries (Mali and Guinea), WHO and the other partners are currently conducting investigations to determine the circumstances behind the emergence and spread of this virus. At the same time, emergency operations to mount a robust and appropriate response are being organized in both countries to stop the spread of the virus and speedily put an end to the outbreak.

"As soon as the new virus was identified, immediate actions were taken to initiate appropriate and targeted immunization activities that are in line with the recent Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) guidelines," says Dr Lucien Manga, acting WHO Representative in Mali.

"The Government of Guinea and partners are informed and we have started evaluating all available resources to prepare for the campaign," says Dr Mamoudou Harouna Djingarey, Deputy WHO Representative in Guinea.

The emergency response must include at least 3 high quality polio campaigns to stop any further spread to other communities. It is highly important for communities to ensure that all under-5 children are vaccinated during the 3 rounds of polio campaigns. The 1st round of immunization will start this week [week of 7 Sep 2015] in Mali and within 14 days in Guinea, according to the guidelines.

Experience from other countries indicates that mass vaccination campaigns need to be carefully planned, prepared and implemented with adequate supportive supervision to guarantee their utmost efficiency. In addition, routine immunization systems should be quickly strengthened in both countries to sustain population immunity and avoid the occurrence of poliovirus (wild or cVDPVs) outbreaks.

Polio is a highly contagious, devastating disease that mainly affects young children in areas with poor sanitation. The virus enters the body through the mouth and spreads easily via faecal contaminated food and water. It invades the nervous system and can cause permanent paralysis or death. Initial symptoms include fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, stiffness in the neck and pain in the limbs.

WHO will continue to support the Ministries of Health of Mali and Guinea to enhance epidemiological surveillance of the virus in order to ensure the timely detection of any outbreaks. It will specifically carry out all necessary actions, including high quality mop-up responses to interrupt all poliovirus transmission.

[This is now the 3rd and possibly 4th countries with an outbreak of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) in 2015. In Madagascar 9 cases of cVDPV type 1 have been reported, and recently 2 cases of cVDPV type 1 were reported from the Ukraine (see Poliomyelitis update (05): Ukraine, vaccine-derived, WHO 20150901.3616558, Poliomyelitis update (04): Ukraine, 2 cases, RFI 20150901.3616015). The report above mentions that the virus isolated most closely resembles a confirmed VDPV detected in Siguiri district in the Kankan Region of Guinea in August 2014. As I was unable to find any documentation of the isolation of a cVDPV from Guinea in 2014 or 2013, it is likely that the isolate referred to was not from a clinical case of polio but rather from environmental sampling. I am confused by the statement that the virus has been circulating across international borders for more than 2 years without detection if it was last identified in August 2014. A clarification would be greatly appreciated.

As a reminder, the occurrence of cVDPV cases is an indicator of low vaccination coverage (discussed in posting Poliomyelitis update (04): Ukraine, 2 cases, RFI 20150901.3616015).

Given the deficiencies in the infrastructure in Guinea during the period of time there has been the ongoing outbreak of Ebola virus disease it is not surprising that vaccination coverages have fallen, as the basic infrastructure has taken a major hit.
