WHO recommends groundbreaking malaria vaccine for children at risk
------------------------------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization (WHO) is recommending widespread use of the RTS,S/AS01 (RTS,S) malaria vaccine among children in sub-Saharan Africa and in other regions with moderate to high _Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria transmission. The recommendation is based on results from an ongoing pilot programme in Ghana, Kenya, and Malawi that has reached more than 800 000 children since 2019.

"This is a historic moment. The long-awaited malaria vaccine for children is a breakthrough for science, child health, and malaria control," said WHO director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. "Using this vaccine on top of existing tools to prevent malaria could save tens of thousands of young lives each year."

Malaria remains a primary cause of childhood illness and death in sub-Saharan Africa. More than 260 000 African children under the age of 5 die from malaria annually. In recent years, WHO and its partners have been reporting a stagnation in progress against the deadly disease.

"For centuries, malaria has stalked sub-Saharan Africa, causing immense personal suffering," said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa. "We have long hoped for an effective malaria vaccine and now for the 1st time ever, we have such a vaccine recommended for widespread use. Today's recommendation offers a glimmer of hope for the continent which shoulders the heaviest burden of the disease and we expect many more African children to be protected from malaria and grow into healthy adults."

WHO recommendation for the RTS,S malaria vaccine
------------------------------------------------
Based on the advice of two WHO global advisory bodies, one for immunization and the other for malaria:

WHO recommends that in the context of comprehensive malaria control the RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine be used for the prevention of _P. falciparum_ malaria in children living in regions with moderate to high transmission as defined by WHO. RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine should be provided in a schedule of 4 doses in children from 5 months of age for the reduction of malaria disease and burden.

Summary of key findings of the malaria vaccine pilots
-----------------------------------------------------
Key findings of the pilots informed the recommendation based on data and insights generated from 2 years of vaccination in child health clinics in the 3 pilot countries, implemented under the leadership of the Ministries of Health of Ghana, Kenya, and Malawi.

Findings include:
- Feasible to deliver: vaccine introduction is feasible, improves health, and saves lives, with good and equitable coverage of RTS,S seen through routine immunization systems. This occurred even in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Reaching the unreached: RTS,S increases equity in access to malaria prevention. Data from the pilot programme showed that more than 2/3 of children in the 3 countries who are not sleeping under a bednet are benefitting from the RTS,S vaccine. Layering the tools results in over 90% of children benefitting from at least one preventive intervention (insecticide-treated bednets or the malaria vaccine).
- Strong safety profile: to date, more than 2.3 million doses of the vaccine have been administered in 3 African countries -- the vaccine has a favorable safety profile.
- No negative impact on the uptake of bednets, other childhood vaccinations, or health seeking behavior for febrile illness. In areas where the vaccine has been introduced, there has been no decrease in the use of insecticide-treated nets, uptake of other childhood vaccinations, or health seeking behavior for febrile illness.
- High impact in real-life childhood vaccination settings: significant reduction (30%) in deadly severe malaria, even when introduced in areas where insecticide-treated nets are widely used and there is good access to diagnosis and treatment.
- Highly cost-effective: modelling estimates that the vaccine is cost effective in areas of moderate to high malaria transmission.

Next steps for the WHO-recommended malaria vaccine will include funding decisions from the global health community for broader roll-out, and country decision-making on whether to adopt the vaccine as part of national malaria control strategies.

Financing for the pilot programme has been mobilized through an unprecedented collaboration among 3 key global health funding bodies: Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; and Unitaid.

[The approval by WHO of the RTS,S (Mosquirix(TM), GlaxoSmithKline) vaccine against _Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria is a milestone development in the fight against the infection and the first human vaccine against a human protozoan parasite. The vaccine is built on the _P. falciparum_ circumsporozoite protein (CSP) described by Nardin and colleagues in 1982 (Nardin EH, Nussenzweig V, Nussenzweig RS, et al. Circumsporozoite proteins of human malaria parasites _Plasmodium falciparum_ and _Plasmodium vivax_. J Exp Med. 1982; 156(1): 20-30; https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.156.1.20).

The immunogenicity of the CSP was enhanced by fusing it to the N-terminal of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and the immunogenicity of this construct was shown in 1997 (Stoute JA, Slaoui M, Heppner DG, et al. A preliminary evaluation of a recombinant circumsporozoite protein vaccine against _Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria. RTS,S Malaria Vaccine Evaluation Group. N Engl J Med. 1997; 336(2): 86-91; https://doi.org/10.1056/nejm199701093360202). Thus, since the discovery of the CSP antigen 39 years have elapsed until the vaccine finally gets widespread use. One missing piece of information is whether it will reduce mortality.

A thorough review of the development of the vaccine was published by Laurens in 2020 (Laurens MB. RTS,S/AS01 vaccine (Mosquirix(TM)): an overview Hum Vaccin Immunother. 2020; 16(3): 480-9; https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2019.1669415). - Mod.EP
