Yellow fever vaccine shortage threat
------------------------------------
Researchers have warned that there is too little yellow fever vaccine to
cope with future outbreaks of the disease. Writing in The Lancet [22
December 2001, Nicolas Nathan and colleagues highlight the problems
encountered by Guinea in Africa, when it faced an outbreak in 2000.
Yellow fever is a viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes. In the most
severe outbreaks, over a half of those affected can die. WHO estimates that
200 000 people in 34 countries across Africa and America are infected with
yellow fever every year, leading to around 30 000 deaths. The disease can
be prevented by vaccination, which protects for at least 10 years.
Between Sep 2000 and Jan 2001, there were 688 cases of yellow fever and 255
deaths in Guinea. The country's Ministry of Health implemented a mass
vaccination programme for the 2 worst affected areas, Mamou and Labé. Mamou
received 630 000 doses of the vaccine before the outbreak peaked. In Labé,
the first delivery of vaccines did not arrive in Guinea until 5 weeks after
an appeal was made and the vaccination programme started 4 weeks after the
peak of the epidemic in Labé, and had to be restricted because less vaccine
had arrived than was needed. At the end of the programme, vaccine coverage
in Mamou and Labé was estimated to be 56 per cent.
In their Lancet paper, Nicolas Nathan and colleagues from Epicentre, Paris,
France, state that: "Yellow fever epidemics are re-emerging in Africa and
America, and the occurrence of repeated rural outbreaks increases the risk
for major urban epidemics. "However, as shown by the Guinean episode, the
international stocks of yellow fever vaccines are not sufficient to provide
an adequate and rapid response to large outbreaks." He highlighted an
yellow fever scare in Kano city, Nigeria, which has 1.5 million
inhabitants, in 2000, and said if that had developed into an epidemic,
there would not have been enough vaccine to cope.
After the Guinea outbreak, the International Coordinating Group on Vaccine
Provision for Epidemic Meningitis Control suggested that UNICEF's stockpile
of 2 million does should only be used in response to outbreaks. He said
stockpiling would limit shortages, but added: "Prevention of yellow fever
epidemics can only be addressed by organising pre-emptive mass vaccination
campaigns or by large and effective introduction of yellow fever
vaccination in the expanded programmes of immunisation of the countries at
risk, as recommended by the WHO."
Dr Gil Lea, consultant in the travel section of the Communicable Disease
Surveillance Centre, part of the Public Health Laboratory Service, said the
Ivory Coast had also been affected by an outbreak this year, and had
immunised 2.6 million people in a vaccination campaign. "There is a strong
argument for vaccination being part of the childhood immunisation programme
for all countries where it is endemic," she said. She added that production
of the vaccine was a major problem. "There are just 6 suppliers in the
whole world who have WHO approval to produce the vaccine - and one of these
has been having production difficulties," she said.

in Guinea. Lancet 2001; 358: 2129-30.
<http://www.thelancet.com/journal/vol358/iss9299/full/llan.358.9299.original
_research.18877.1>. The abstract reads as follows: "A yellow fever epidemic
erupted in Guinea in September, 2000. From 4 Sep 2000 to 7 Jan 2001, 688
instances of the disease and 225 deaths were reported. The diagnosis was
laboratory confirmed by IgM detection in more than 40 patients. A mass
vaccination campaign was limited by insufficient international stocks.
After the epidemic in Guinea, the International Coordinating Group on
Vaccine Provision for Epidemic Meningitis Control decided that 2 million
doses of 17D yellow fever vaccine, being stored as part of a UNICEF
stockpile, should be used only in response to outbreaks." - Mod.CP
