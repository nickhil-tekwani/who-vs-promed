A disease, suspected to be Ebola or Marburg haemorrhagic fever, has broken out in Kiryandongo district.

On [Sun 10 Jun 2018] morning, a woman resident of Bweyale town council, was admitted with signs of the 2 ailments and died shortly after arrival.

According to the district Secretary for Health Rashid Okecha, health officials tried all they could to give her treatment but in vain. "The woman was admitted at around 8 AM on [Sun 10 Jun 2018] with a severe fever and blood was flowing out of her body passing through every opening," Okecha said.

He added that a blood sample has been taken to the Uganda Virus Research Institute. "After testing, we shall be able to ascertain what the patient was suffering from. The deceased will be buried today [Mon 11 Jun 2018] to avoid any chances of contact," Okecha said. According to him, the burial will be carried out by the medical control team.

Efforts to get additional information from the hospital's medical superintendent were futile as our calls went unanswered.

Okecha said the community is going to be sensitised to take preventive measures against the virus.

[The Kiryandongo district in western Uganda is far distant from the Manafwa district in the east where an outbreak of 222 cases of hemorrhagic fever, later diagnosed as malaria, occurred as of 31 May 2018 (see ProMED-mail archive Undiagnosed hemorrhagic fever - Uganda (03): (MW) children, malaria conf 20180608.5845573). On a geographic basis, that outbreak is unrelated to the above case. The prompt burial by the medical control is prudent, in order to avoid any further transmission of either of the suspected viruses, should they prove to be responsible for this case.

Presumably, other viruses that can cause hemorrhagic fever, such as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Sosuga, yellow fever and Rift Valley fever will be included in the tests done in the Uganda Virus Research Institute. ProMED will be interested in receiving information about the test results and if any further cases occur.

Marburg disease virus infections occur sporadically in Uganda. On 17 Oct 2017, the Ugandan Ministry of Health notified WHO of a confirmed outbreak with 3 cases of Marburg virus disease in Kween district, Eastern Uganda. There was a suspected case of Ebola virus infection in Luwero district, Uganda, last year (2017) as well (see ProMED-mail archive Ebola-like illness - Uganda (03): (LW) 20170814.5247693). These districts are also far away from the locality where the above fatality occurred. - Mod.TY
