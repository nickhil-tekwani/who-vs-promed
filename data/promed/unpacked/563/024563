[Since the 2nd week of September 2010, clinical cases of bovine
ephemeral fever have been observed by "Hachaklait" (Israel's Mutual
Society for Clinical Veterinary Services) practitioners in cattle
farms in several parts of the country. The following 4 short weekly
reports of Hachaklait's chief veterinarian provide some information
on the epizootic. - Mod.AS]

11 Sep 2010
-----------
Several suspected clinical cases of BEF in dairy farms in the
Northern Negev, Shephelah and Heffer valley. Sporadic cases in each
farm. Clinical signs: salivation, fever, tachypnea and sometimes
recumbency. Several cases have been confirmed by PCR tests in the
Kimron Veterinary Institute.

19 Sep 2010
-----------
Many farms have been added to the list during this week, reporting of
similar symptoms; the majority of them in the Heffer valley.
[Centre-north Israel coastal plain]. There are several cases of
recumbency and mortality. The age of the affected animals varies
between 10-month-old heifers to adult cows. The morbidity varies
between sporadic cases to many dozens, subject to
observation/attention capability. There is clinical impression that
early NSAID treatment provides a relieving effect and shortens the
illness duration.

25 Sep 2010
-----------
The disease slowly moves in north-eastern direction but is still
mainly present in the Heffer valley. Disease severity is very
variable; several abortions and mortalities reported.

2 Oct 2010
----------
BEF continues to affect cattle in the Heffer valley area; its
incidence is significantly lower in the northern Negev and the
Shephelah. No newly affected farms/regions reported.

[Bovine epizootic fever (BEF), also known as 3-day sickness, 3-day
stiff-sickness, dragon boat disease, lazy man's disease and dengue of
cattle, is an economically important viral, arthropod-borne disease,
exclusively affecting cattle and water buffalo. The disease is known
to be endemic in most tropical and subtropical areas of Africa,
Australia, the Middle East, and Asia. There is serological evidence
that animals might be infected in central Russia. Some countries
experience localized outbreaks in most years; others report cases
only during epizootics. BEF virus (BEFV) has not been reported from
Europe, North or South America, or New Zealand.

The BEFV is a member of the genus _Ephemerovirus_ in the family
Rhabdoviridae. There is only one serotype. Other members of this
genus (Adelaide River virus, Kimberley virus, Berrimah virus, Puchong
virus, and Malakal virus) can cross-react in some serological tests.
Its impact includes lost production -- decreased milk yield, loss of
condition, abortion, temporary infertility in bulls, and prolonged
recovery in some animals -- as well as trade restrictions. Although
mortality is usually low, cattle in good condition are affected more
severely; mortality rates as high as 30 percent have been reported in
very fat cattle.

During the 20th century, BEF occurred at irregular and long intervals
in Israel; following an outbreak in 1951, the disease recurred in
September 1990 (north-east) and later in the late summer months of
2000 and 2001. Since then, large scale epizootics have been reported
in 2004, 2008 and 2009. The mortality rate in 1990 was 3 percent and
in 1999 almost 4 percent in affected dairy herds. The average
mortality or emergency-slaughter rates in such herds was, reportedly,
0.4 percent for calves (up to one year old) and 4.4 percent for cows
in production. Milk production losses were estimated as 380 kg per
milking cow in affected herds. Additional data on the 2004 epizootic
can be found in Ref 2.

Graphic presentation on BEF in Israel since 2000 can be found in the
recently published annual report of the Israeli Veterinary Services,
available at
<http://www.vetserv.moag.gov.il/NR/rdonlyres/401D0A6E-6FA9-41AD-B52E-130299EA5CC5/0/doch_shnati_2009_new.pdf>.
See Page 55 - diagram "number of BEF outbreaks 2000 - 2009", and page
56 - "map of BEF outbreaks 2009". Though the text is partly in
Hebrew, information can be readily deciphered. The legend for the
signs on the 2009 map is: Square - February; asterisk - July; circle
- August; diamond - September and triangle - October.

Following the 2004 epizootic, the Israeli Veterinary Services/Kimron
Veterinary Institute undertook the production of an inactivated BEF
vaccine, which since 2008 has been put into limited experimental
field application. It will be interesting to obtain information on
the gathered experience and on the effectiveness of the vaccine as
observed during the current epizootic.

According to an updated estimate of Hachaklait, more than 100 farms
have already been affected during the 2010 epizootic. They are
situated within Israel's coastal plain: center north (Heffer valley),
center-south (Shephelah) and south (Negev). For more geography, see
"Israeli coastal plain" at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_coastal_plain#Central_Coastal_Plain>.

BEF, which is certainly much more widespread in the Mediterranean
basin than reported, deserves enhanced attention, having -- like
other arthropod-borne viral diseases -- the potential of invading virgin areas.
