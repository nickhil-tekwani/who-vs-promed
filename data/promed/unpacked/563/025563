Consultant medical doctor dies of Lassa fever in Adamawa
--------------------------------------------------------
Disaster struck in Adamawa State, as the outbreak of Lassa fever
claimed the life of a consultant medical doctor, working at the
Federal Medical Centre in Yola. 2 other persons are currently
receiving treatment at Irrua Specialist Centre for the Control of
Tropical and Infectious Diseases. Dr Aliyu Danburam, chief medical
director of the Federal Medical Centre, Yola, who confirmed the
outbreak, however, said that the epidemiological units of the Federal
Ministry of Health, and the Federal Medical Centre, Yola, were working
round the clock to contain the epidemic.

Dr Danburam said in early March [2011], it was noticed that a few
doctors at the medical centre developed symptoms of viral haemorrhagic
fever after treating a patient, and that since the disease was not
common in the environment, thus making the diagnosis difficult, they
were referred to the specialist centre for the control of tropical and
infectious diseases.

He stated that it was at the specialist centre that it was confirmed
that they had Lassa fever, adding that the consultant, who was the
index patient, eventually died while the 2 other doctors were still
undergoing treatment. He, however, disclosed that another person, a
senior laboratory technologist, who died during the same period, had
cardiac failure and not Lassa fever.

Dr Danburam said due to the highly infectious nature of Lassa fever,
which he said could be catastrophic if not urgently brought under
control, the federal epidemiological unit had established a
surveillance squad at the medical centre, to screen all cases that
could be remotely linked to the outbreak, while adequate medications
and equipment were being put in place to meet future challenges.

[Lassa haemorrhagic fever is an acute illness of 1-4 weeks duration
that occurs throughout West Africa. Though first described in the
1950s, the virus causing the disease was not identified until 1969.
The virus is a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the virus family
_Arenaviridae_. Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Guinea, Liberia,
Sierra Leone, and throughout Nigeria but probably exists in other West
African countries as well.

About 80 percent of human infections are asymptomatic; the remaining
cases have severe multi-system disease, where the virus affects
several organs in the body, such as the liver, spleen and kidneys. The
incubation period of Lassa fever ranges from 6-21 days. Lassa fever is
a zoonotic disease. The animal reservoir of Lassa virus is a rodent of
the genus _Mastomys_, commonly known as the "multimammate rat."
_Mastomys_ infected with Lassa virus do not become ill, but they can
shed the virus in their urine and faeces.

An image of a multimammate rat can be viewed at
http://www15.bni-hamburg.de/bni/bni2/neu2/getfile.acgi?area=forschunggruppen&pid=21232.

Lassa fever can affect all age groups. Persons at greatest risk are
those living in rural areas where _Mastomys_ are usually found,
especially in areas of poor sanitation or crowded living conditions.
There is no epidemiological evidence supporting airborne spread
between humans, but person-to-person transmission occurs in both
community and health care settings.

Lassa fever is one of the endemic zoonoses in Nigeria, with a high
probability for nosocomial transmission due to several health care
sector challenges. Although treatment is available for Lassa fever,
early diagnosis is still difficult in almost all Nigerian health care
institutions. (For a recent review, see, V. Idemyor: Lassa virus
infection in Nigeria: clinical perspective overview. J Natl Med Assoc
2010; 102(12): 1243-6; available at
