On 26 Jan 2020, the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that the new coronavirus was detected in environmental samples from the South China Seafood Market in Wuhan [see item 2]. The virus originated from wild animals sold in the seafood market.

For this reason, the State General Administration of Market Supervision, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, and the National Forestry and Grassland Bureau jointly issued a public announcement on the 26th that from now on until the end of the national epidemic, wild animal trading activities are prohibited to cut off the source and transmission of the virus.

On 28 Jan 2020, the State Forestry and Grassland Administration issued the Work Plan on Supervision and Inspection of Strengthening the Implementation and Control of Wildlife Control Measures, requiring local supervisory agencies to implement inspection responsibilities for wildlife trading markets, restaurants, and other places, and for wildlife trading. [There is] supervision and inspection of the clearance and surveillance of wild animal epidemics and the establishment of a daily reporting system.

Hubei, Shanghai, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Jilin, Henan, Inner Mongolia, Jiangsu, Hunan, and other provinces/autonomous regions and municipalities immediately issued policies to urgently suspend wildlife trading.

In addition to banning wildlife trade, some provinces have stopped trading live birds. Hubei, Inner Mongolia, and Henan have banned the sale of live poultry and wild animals. The Henan Provincial Market Supervision Bureau issued a document on 21 Jan 2020, demanding that the sale of live poultry be banned on the market from now on. Operators who still sell live poultry on the market and kill poultry products such as poultry onsite will be ordered to cease operations. Shanghai requires that from 25 Jan to 30 Apr 2020, Shanghai will implement a seasonal suspension of live bird trading. Yunnan province prohibits bamboo rats, tadpoles, and other wild animals that may carry the new coronavirus from being transported, traded, and sold on the market. It also requires strict implementation of the ban on live birds at the local farmers' market.

Jilin, Shandong, Hubei, and other places announced the suspension of all wildlife-related transactions and exhibition activities. The Shaanxi Provincial Forestry Bureau has introduced 10 measures to ensure a safe distance between people and animals. From 22 Jan 2020, Wuhan Zoo, Jiufeng Forest Zoo, and other scenic spots have been closed to the outside world. Breeders disinfect the cages and out-of-house playgrounds in accordance with the established disinfection system every day.

Some regions have policies that prohibit online wildlife trading. Zhejiang province strengthened the monitoring of e-commerce platforms, banned online trading of wild animals, and searched and blocked 32 keywords of wild animals. Shenzhen requires various edible agricultural products wholesale markets, farmer's markets, shopping malls, supermarkets and other trading markets (places) and their internal operators, and various catering service units and e-commerce platform operators are strictly prohibited from trading wild animals and their products. Shanxi Taiyuan Market Supervision and Administration Bureau issued the "Notice on Strengthening the Supervision of Wild Animal Markets." The operators of various farmers' markets, supermarkets, restaurants, and e-commerce platforms in the city are strictly prohibited from trading wild animals and their products in any form and closing live bird trading.

In order to effectively prevent the spread of pneumonia outbreaks of new coronavirus infections, many regions have implemented strict law enforcement to ban wild animal trading venues and block trading channels.

Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region will monitor the business entities that sell wild animals and live poultry and live animals on the internet within the autonomous region. As of the afternoon of 25 Jan 2020, 7 online shops suspected of selling related products have been monitored, involving 7 alliance cities including Hohhot. All products in the 7 shops have, by now, been removed and their websites closed.

On the afternoon of 26 Jan 2020, Zhou Zhenghua, deputy director of the Zhumadian Forestry Public Security Bureau of Henan province, led a team to conduct a one-by-one inspection on Zhumadian's agricultural product market, pet market, flower and bird trading market, and wildlife domestication, breeding, and trading venues. As of 5 p.m. on 27 Jan [2020], Zhumadian had dispatched a total of 11 police cars with more than 50 police officers to investigate more than 30 markets in the city. Due to the publicity in place, no wild animals were found.

Songjiang district of Shanghai issued notices to 3 indoor zoo-type business establishments, including Xingmeng pet, and suspended operations. At present, the monitoring of epidemic diseases is mainly carried out. Daily inspections are carried out at 5 wildlife monitoring stations at or above the municipal level to observe whether there is abnormal behavior of wild animals and whether there are abnormal deaths.

Guangdong province temporarily suspended the application for national administrative protection permits for wildlife hunting, breeding, sale, purchase, utilization, and transportation. Transshipment and trafficking of wild animals is strictly forbidden. As of 27 Jan 2020, the market supervision department inspected a total of 3835 farmers' markets and 8984 live poultry operators and found that there were 8 problems with illegal sales of wild animals, of which 7 completed rectification and filed a case for investigation.

Hunan province has implemented a "one control, 4 prohibitions" measure and sealed off and isolated all wild animals in artificial breeding sites.

In Zhejiang province, a total of 7486 inspection and enforcement officers were dispatched by the market supervision department. They have inspected 2224 farmers' markets, 13 507 households, and 787 malls and supermarkets.

Beijing, Hebei, Chongqing, Shanxi, Ningxia, and other places have initiated joint prevention and control measures to severely investigate and deal with activities such as wildlife trading and transshipment.

A total of 585 samples were collected from 2 batches of South China Seafood City. PCR tests showed that 33 samples were positive for the new coronavirus nucleic acid. The investigation found that the South China Seafood Market was nominally a seafood market but was actually a comprehensive market.

China Daily, 26 Jan 2020 (reporter Wang Xiaodong). A reporter learned today from the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that since the outbreak of a new coronavirus, the center's virus disease center has continued to address the virus traceability research and made progress. For the 1st time, from 585 environmental samples from the South China Seafood Market, 33 samples contained novel coronavirus nucleic acids, and the virus was successfully isolated from positive environmental specimens, suggesting that the virus originated from wild animals sold in the South China Seafood Market [see comment].

Most of the early confirmed cases of Wuhan's new coronavirus epidemic came from Wuhan South China Seafood Market. On 31 Dec 2019, according to the requirements of the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the selected expert group went to Wuhan to participate in the epidemic prevention and control activities, and in the early morning of 1 Jan 2020, drafted the "Environment Traceability Work Plan." At 8 a.m. on 1 Jan 2020, I went to South China Seafood City to collect 515 environmental samples from case-related merchants and related neighborhoods and transported them to the virus disease laboratory for testing. On 12 Jan 2020, experts from the Institute of Viral Diseases collected an additional 70 specimens of wild animal vendors in the South China Seafood Market and transferred them to the laboratory for testing.

PCR tests showed that 33 samples out of the 585 collected were positive for the new coronavirus nucleic acid. These positive samples were collected from 22 stalls and one garbage truck on the market, of which 93.9% (31/33) positive specimens were distributed in the western part of the South China Seafood Market. The investigation found that the South China Seafood Market was nominally a seafood market but was actually a comprehensive market. There is a wildlife trade in the western part of the South China Seafood Market, especially in the areas near 7th and 8th streets within the western area, where there are many wildlife dealers; the positive samples were concentrated in this area, accounting for 42.4% of all positive samples (14/33). In summary, it is highly suspected that the outbreak is related to the wildlife trade.

Virus isolation was carried out on coronavirus-sensitive cell lines. Electron microscopy, PCR, and in-depth sequencing results have shown that the novel coronavirus has been successfully isolated from environmental samples, further confirming the seafood [market] in South China. There are a large number of new coronaviruses 2019-nCoV in urban environments.

Wuhan Municipal Health and Health Commission's briefing on the current pneumonia epidemic situation in our city
Issuing authority: Wuhan City health committee. Published: 31 Dec 2019 13:38:05
---------------------------------
Recently, some medical institutions found that many of the pneumonia cases received were related to South China Seafood City. After receiving the report, the Municipal Health and Health Commission immediately launched a case search and retrospective investigation related to South China Seafood City in the city's medical health institutions; 27 cases have been found, of which 7 are in serious condition, and the remaining cases are stable and controllable. Two patients are expected to be discharged in the near future. The clinical manifestations of the cases were mainly fever; a few patients had difficulty breathing, and chest radiographs showed bilateral lung infiltrative lesions. At present, all cases have been isolated for treatment; follow-up investigations and medical observations of close contacts are ongoing, and hygiene investigations and environmental sanitation disposals for South China Seafood City are ongoing.

Wuhan organized consultations with clinical, medical, epidemiological, and virological experts from Tongji Hospital, Provincial CDC, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan Infectious Diseases Hospital, and Wuhan CDC. According to the analysis of epidemiological investigations and preliminary laboratory tests, the above cases are considered to be viral pneumonia. The investigation so far has not found any obvious human-to-human transmission and no medical staff infection. Detection of the pathogen and investigation of the cause of the infection are ongoing.

Viral pneumonia is more common in winter and spring and can be spread or outbreak. The clinical manifestations are fever, soreness, dyspnea in a small part, and lung infiltration. Viral pneumonia is related to the virulence of the virus, the route of infection, and the age and immune status of the host. Viruses that cause viral pneumonia are common with influenza viruses, and others are parainfluenza virus, cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, rhinovirus, and coronavirus. Confirmation depends on pathogenic tests, including virus isolation, serological tests, and viral antigen and nucleic acid tests. The disease is preventable and controllable, and indoor air circulation is prevented to prevent public places and closed places where there is no air circulation. People can wear masks when going out. Symptomatic treatment is the main clinical practice, and bed rest is required. If you have the above symptoms, especially the persistent fever, you should go to the medical institution in time.

[While the large "South China Seafood City" market, or rather its western part (and within that part, in particular the areas near the 7th and 8th streets), may have played a role in the epidemiology of the disease, the lack of evidence of infection in animals kept/traded/slaughtered in the market is in need of explanation.

A recent paper (Ref 1 below) includes "Figure 1. Onset of Illness among the First 425 Confirmed Cases of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-Infected Pneumonia (NCIP)."

The following timeline data, extracted from the paper, have relevance to the assessment of animal involvement in 2019nCoV:

1. 8 Dec 2019: 1st human case; not linked to Huanan (Southern China) Seafood Wholesale Market.
2. 10 Dec 2019: 2nd human case; not linked to Huanan market.
3. 13 Dec 2019: 3rd human case; linked to Huanan market.
4. Between 14-28 Dec 2019, 30 new cases, of which 11 cases not linked, 19 cases linked to the Huanan market.
5. 29 Dec 2019: "Pneumonia cases [declared] linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market."
6. 30 Dec 2019: Case finding activated
7. 31 Dec 2019: "Outbreak announced by WHC; NHC and China CDC involved in investigation and response."
8. 1 Jan 2020: Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market closed.

The authors indicate that "the majority of cases (55%) with onset before 1 Jan 2020 were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases."

The paper does not elaborate on the market's "closing" procedures. However, some details could be retrieved from China's "Sina Technology" website, dated 31 Dec 2019 (Google translation), as follows:

"On [31 Dec 2019], an official report from Hubei province said: "The investigation found that most of the cases were operated by South China Seafood City in Jianghan district, Wuhan. The National Health and Health Commission has decided to send an expert group to our province to guide the epidemic disposal on the morning of [31 Dec 2019]. At present, related virus typing, isolation treatment, public opinion control, and terminal disinfection are underway." https://tech.sina.com.cn/roll/2019-12-31/doc-iihnzhfz9428799.shtml

Additional information was included in the following media report from Sina Technology (in Chinese, Google translated) dated 9 Jan 2020: "A scholar close to the expert group told the reporter of Caijing that the wild animals sold in the South China Seafood Market are currently under inspection to track down the source of the virus" (http://tech.sina.com.cn/roll/2020-01-09/doc-iihnzahk3089851.shtml). The said report was included as item [2] "Sina Tech News: Evolution of pathogen identification" in ProMED-mail's posting 20200110.6881082.

From the above sources it may be concluded that the closing of the market (on 1 Jan 2020) followed the "disposal" of the market's animals (on 31 Dec 2019?) and their sampling for lab examination. This scenario deserves to be confirmed or corrected. Pending questions include the following: How many animals have been sampled/culled? What were their respective species? What were the lab results?

Another paper (Ref 2 below), by the team that diagnosed the 1st cases of the epidemic, published on 23 Jan 2020, included the following abstract:

"Since the SARS outbreak 18 years ago, a large number of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV) have been discovered in their natural reservoir host, bats. Previous studies indicated that some of those bat SARSr-CoVs have the potential to infect humans. Here we report the identification and characterization of a novel coronavirus (nCoV-2019), which caused an epidemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans in Wuhan, China. The epidemic, started from 12 Dec 2019, has caused 198 laboratory-confirmed infections with 3 fatal cases by 20 Jan 2020. Full-length genome sequences were obtained from 5 patients at the early stage of the outbreak. They are almost identical to each other and share 79.5% sequence identity to SARS-CoV. Furthermore, it was found that nCoV-2019 is 96% identical at the whole genome level to a bat coronavirus. The pairwise protein sequence analysis of 7 conserved non-structural proteins show that this virus belongs to the species of SARSr-CoV. The nCoV-2019 virus was then isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a critically ill patient, which can be neutralized by sera from several patients. Importantly, we have confirmed that this novel CoV uses the same cell entry receptor, ACE2, as SARS-CoV."

The above paper includes Table 1 presenting the data of the 7 1st 2019nCoV patients. While 6 patients (ICU 04, 05, 06, 08, 09, 10; 4 males, 2 females, dates of onset between 17 and 23 Dec 2020) were all described as "fresh seafood market peddlers or deliverymen," the 1st patient, No. ICU-01 (male, 62, date of onset 12 Dec 2019, date of admission 27 Dec 2019, recovered and discharged) was not known to be related to the market ("contact history unclear").

The mode, animal source (an intermediate domestic or wild animal, in case not infected directly from bats), and place of the initial 2019-nCoV human infection in China remain to be identified. According to the said 2 papers, its likeliness to have taken place on the seafood market is doubted.
