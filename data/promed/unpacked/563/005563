No doubt we all recall the stir created early this year by Harash Narang
over purported BSE-infected chickens, the media stories it aroused and the
fact-free speculation it prompted.
The following letter from Dr R J G Cawthorne, Assistant Chief Veterinary
Office, MAFF, appears in the latest issue of Veterinary Record (Vol 141,
23 August, 203).

Failure to confirm a TSE in chickens.
In January and February this year there was speculation in the media about
the possibility that BSE might have transmitted to chickens. This arose
following investigations undertaken by Dr Harash Narang of neurological
disease in two hens.
Dr Narang initially informed MAFF that there was 'no evidence of tumour and
no obvious vacuolation' in the brain of either chicken but that there was
'some neuronal loss and shrunken neurons in all parts of the brain'.
Subsequently he reported that. Following the completion of immunostaining,
'PrP and positive plaques' had been found and that 'this must be regarded
as very strong evidence demonstrating that the hens had been incubating
spongiform encephalopathy'.
As requested Dr Narang then supplied brain tissue from two birds to MAFF
for examination at the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA), at Weybridge
and Lasswade. He also sent a number of photomicrographs.
Investigations at the VLA included examination of haemotoxylin and eosin
stained sections for evidence of neuropathological changes together with
immunohistochemistry for PrP using a CVL standard immunostaining protocol
and a method which sought to reproduce the protocol used by Dr Narang.
The investigations revealed no evidence of spongiform change,
disease-specific immunostaining or of plaque formation. Staining
identified in the photomicrographs was also considered to be non-specific.
There was, however, evidence in one brain of a non-suppurative
meningoencephalitis, In view of the high profile of this investigation we
delayed communication of our results until the material had been further
examined by an independent neuropathologist. That report has now been
received and the interpretation is in agreement with that of the
specialists at the VLA.
We do not, therefore, consider that either of the birds in question was
affected with a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy. The results of
our investigations are consistent with the as yet unpublished results of
experimental challenges where attempts to transmit BSE to poultry by
parenteral or oral inoculation have not been successful.
[Sorry, Ralph, this one got misfiled and thanks for sending it in. I hope
the update is useful to anyone concerned about earlier reports of TSEs in
chickens. -Mod. PC
