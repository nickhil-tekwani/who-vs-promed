Equine piroplasmosis, Croatia
-----------------------------
Information received on 20 Nov 2017 from Dr Damir Agicic, assistant to minister, chief veterinary officer, Veterinary and Food Safety Directorate, CRO Ministry of Agriculture, ZAGREB, Croatia

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 2 Nov 2017
Date of confirmation of the event: 14 Nov 2017
Reason for notification: reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 2001
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: _Babesia caballi__and _Theileria equi_
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (basic, advanced), necropsy
This event pertains to the whole country.

New outbreaks: 1
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Krupace, Krasic, Zagrebacka [Zagreb]
Date of start of the outbreak: 2 Nov 2017
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Equidae / 38 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 0

Affected population: This is the 1st case of piroplasmosis confirmed in the official laboratory and notified to the competent authority. On the holding with 38 horses, horses started to lose weight, but no typical signs of piroplasmosis (anaemia, icterus) were observed. Two animals died (mare and foal). Foal died acutely and the mare had to be euthanized due to her severe health condition. The mare was pathologically examined, and samples were taken. _Babesia_/_Theileria_ were identified with PCR on faecal samples. Other horses will be treated depending on their clinical condition.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Equidae / 2.6 / 2.6 / 100 / 5.3
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Control measures
Measures applied: vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists), treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Croatian Veterinary Institute (national laboratory) / Equidae / real-time PCR/ 14 Nov 2017 / Positive

Future reporting

["Equine piroplasmosis is a tickborne protozoal disease of horses, mules, donkeys and zebra. The aetiological agents are blood parasites named _Theileria equi_ and _Babesia caballi_. _Theileria equi_ was previously designated as _Babesia equi_. Infected animals may remain carriers of these parasites for long periods and act as sources of infection for ticks, which act as vectors.

"The introduction of carrier animals into areas where tick vectors are prevalent can lead to an epizootic spread of the disease.

"The clinical signs of equine piroplasmosis are often nonspecific, and the disease can easily be confused with other conditions. Piroplasmosis can occur in peracute, acute and chronic forms. The acute cases are more common and are characterised by fever that usually exceeds 40 C [104 F], reduced appetite and malaise, elevated respiratory and pulse rates, congestion of mucous membranes, and faecal balls that are smaller and drier than normal.

"Clinical signs in subacute cases are similar. In addition, affected animals show loss of weight, and fever is sometimes intermittent. The mucous membranes vary from pale pink to pink, or pale yellow to bright yellow. Petechiae and/or ecchymoses may also be visible on the mucous membranes. Normal bowel movements may be slightly depressed and the animals may show signs of mild colic. Mild oedematous swelling of the distal part of the limbs sometimes occurs.

"Chronic cases usually present nonspecific clinical signs such as mild inappetence, poor performance and a drop-in body mass. The spleen is usually found to be enlarged on rectal examination.

"A rare peracute form where horses are found either dead or moribund has been reported" http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.05.08_EQUINE_PIROPLASMOSIS.pdf.

"Some species of _Babesia_ or _Theileria_ can occasionally infect species other than their usual host, including humans. To date, the most important pathogens for humans appear to be the bovine pathogen _B. divergens_ in Europe and the rodent species _B. microti_ in the US.

"Although _B. caballi_ or _T. equi_ may have been implicated in a few human infections in the past, these organisms do not seem to be important zoonoses. However, human babesiosis is still incompletely understood, and the possibility of infection with these organisms has not been ruled out" http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/equine_piroplasmosis.pdf. - Mod.CRD
