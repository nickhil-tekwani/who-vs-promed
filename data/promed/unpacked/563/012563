[Ref: S Kiewnick et al: First report of root-knot nematode
_Meloidogyne enterolobii_ on tomato and cucumber in Switzerland.
Plant Dis 2008; 92(9): 1370; DOI: 10.1094/PDIS-92-9-1370A]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Severe stunting and extensive root galling were observed on tomato
rootstock (_Solanum lycopersicum_) resistant to _Meloidogyne
incognita_, _M. javanica_, and _M. arenaria_, and cucumber (_Cucumis
sativus_) from 2 commercial greenhouses in the cantons Aargau and
Lucerne in northern Switzerland.

Examination of the roots of infected plants revealed the presence of
root-knot nematodes in large numbers. Juveniles, males, and females
were isolated, and the species was determined on the basis of
morphological characteristics. Identification was confirmed by enzyme
[electrophoretic] analysis. All methods of identification were
consistent with _M. enterolobii_. For further confirmation, type
material of _M. enterolobii_ (from the original host _Enterolobium
contortisiliquum_ [earpod tree, family _Mimosaceae_]) from China was
used. Furthermore, comparison of the [nucleotide] sequence data from
12 individuals of each of the 2 Swiss populations and the type
material of a 310 bp [basepair], a 723 bp, and a 780 bp fragment
showed 100 percent homology and confirmed the identification as _M.
enterolobii_.

The species _M. enterolobii_ is of great importance because it is
able to reproduce on [root-knot nematode] resistant tobacco, pepper,
watermelon, and tomato. To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of
_M. enterolobii_ in Switzerland.

[Root-knot nematodes (_Meloidogyne_ spp.) attack a wide range of
plants, including many common vegetables, fruit trees, and
ornamentals. The genus contains around 70 species and is found
worldwide in tropical and sub-tropical regions in many types of soil.
Symptoms may include stunting, wilting and leaf chlorosis, and large
galls are formed throughout the root system affecting plant vigour.
Severe infections may kill the host and result in significant
economic losses. The pathogens are spread by plant material, in
infested soil, and by mechanical means, for example contaminated
equipment. Eggs can persist in the soil for years. Once root-knot
nematodes have been introduced, it is in general difficult to control
or eradicate them. Disease management requires an integrated approach
of phytosanitary and cultural measures, nematicides, and use of
resistant crop varieties.

An alert for _M. enterolobii_ was issued by the European Plant
Protection Organisation (EPPO) earlier in 2008 when quarantine
interceptions in Holland on material from several origins were
reported. The species is polyphagous and, although its precise host
range is still unknown, it has been found on many economically
important crops including coffee, soybean, sweet potato, beans,
guava, and several solanaceous and cucurbit vegetables. It is
considered a particularly aggressive pathogen with increased
virulence against crop varieties resistant to other root-knot
nematodes.
