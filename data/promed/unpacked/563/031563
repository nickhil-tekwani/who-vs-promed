There have been 2 new cases of St. Louis encephalitis confirmed, one
each in Ouachita and Morehouse parishes.
The cases Friday bring the total to 63 since the outbreak first was
reported 8 Aug 2001. Of those, 59 originated in Ouachita and 2 each in
Richland and Morehouse parishes; 3 people have died.
While the cases increase, officials remain frustrated in efforts to fight
the mosquitos blamed for spreading the virus to humans. Tests ordered
by the expert hired to end the outbreak found that the airplanes used
for mosquito control aren't equipped properly. The planes were
spraying insecticide at a concentration roughly 20% less than what
manufacturers recommend, Yates found. "It's a difference of
a million (insecticide) droplets per acre. And each drop can kill a
mosquito," Yates said.
Manufacturers recommend the chemical Anvil be sprayed from planes
at a concentration of 0.62 of an ounce per acre. Tests found the most
the mosquito control planes could deliver without modification is 0.49
of an ounce of per acre. The tests also found that the mosquito control
planes did not have the guidance systems necessary to allow them to
accurately hit target areas with insecticide.
At a meeting Friday, Machado could not provide Yates with
documentation on the effectiveness of [the earial spraying to eliminate
immature mosquitoes. "So we don't know if it worked or not, and
that's the bottom line," Yates said. But Yates also said cooler
temperatures are a good sign. "That alone, if it persists, is going to take
care of this epidemic." Mosquitoes are less active when temperatures
are cool, and the virus stops replicating in mosquitoes once the
temperature drops below 55 degrees, he said.

about aerial mosquito spraying over large cities - Mod.JW
