CRYPTOCOCCUS GATTII - DENMARK EX CANADA (BRITISH COLUMBIA)

We would like to clarify the novelty and geographic extent of _Cryptococcus
gattii_ in British Columbia (BC), Canada in response to the 28 Dec 2006
ProMED posting of this infection in an international traveler (1).
Endemic acquisition of _C. gattii_ has been occurring in the province of BC
since 1999. There has been no recent increase or cluster of cases. There
have been over 160 human cases reported to date among BC residents, for an
annual provincial incidence of 6 cases/million population (2). Contrary to
comments made in the ProMED posting, cases have been exposed largely on the
eastern coast of Vancouver Island. The incidence of _C. gattii_ infection
on Vancouver Island is 36/million (3). Vancouver Island is the largest
island on the Pacific coast of North America, located approximately 50 km
west of the BC mainland. The vast majority of the rest of BC remains
unaffected by this environmental fungus.
Cases among tourists to Vancouver Island have been previously reported,
mostly among BC residents traveling from the mainland to Vancouver Island
(4). Publications such as the one by Jens Lindberg and colleagues (1) help
raise awareness that _C. gattii_ infection can be acquired in non-tropical
environments such as BC.
_C. gattii_ has been found in most tree species, in soil, water and air on
Vancouver Island (5,6). It has not been isolated from eucalyptus trees in
BC. _C. gattii_'s range is believed to be increasing. Since 2003, human and
animal cases without exposure to Vancouver Island but with the same or
similar genotype as that found on the Island have been found on the BC
mainland and in Pacific Northwestern US states (3). BC researchers continue
to study _C. gattii_ to better understand the reasons for its emergence and
spread.
