Camels of an estimated value of Rs 2.2 billion [USD 25 638 038] have
died in the last 2 months in the Cholistan desert.

Residents of the area have expressed grave concern over a virus that
has killed over 120 000 camels in the Rahim Yar Khan, Bahawalpur and
Bahawalnagar districts. At least 300 000 camels have been afflicted
with the virus, and locals have blamed the Livestock Department for
not distributing an adequate amount of vaccine.

Speaking to The Express Tribune, former Cholistan nazim Hassan Daaha
claimed that the issue of camel vaccinations had been politicised, as
the Cholistan Development Authority fell under the jurisdiction of
the Punjab governor, and the Livestock Department operated under the
Punjab government. However, Bahawalpur Livestock Officer Rafiq Gondal
claimed that they had known about the disease since December 2010 but
that Cholistan did not come under their area jurisdiction. "We did
constitute 2 teams of veterinary doctors to visit the area, and these
mobile teams examined and treated more than 2000 camels," he said.
Gindal said that the vaccine to treat the camels cost only Rs5 [USD
0.058] per animal.

He said that on special instructions from Punjab Livestock director
general Irfan Zahid, his teams had sent blood and serum samples of
the camels to the laboratories in Lahore and Islamabad. "They said it
was bacterial [bronchopneumonia] and that the disease had erupted
from Balochistan and Thal," Gondal added.

Camel herders have appealed to the Punjab chief minister and
government for assistance and have asked the Lahore High Court to
take up the issue against the Livestock Department.

[The above newswire is rather blurred if not confusing. According to
OIE's data, Pakistan's total camel (dromedary) population (2009
figures) is 930 000. The above report says that "at least 300 000
camels have been afflicted with the virus, of which 120 000 died."
Such morbidity and mortality rates (provided they are correct), would
take an exceptionally virulent disease agent, which, so far, remains
unidentified.

A "vaccine" is mentioned; which vaccine?! Mentioning "a virus" is
also in need of substantiation.

The Cholistan Desert adjoins the Thar Desert, spreading into the
Pakistani Punjab province. In November 2010, it was suggested that
similarly devastating losses in Thar camels were suspected to be
caused by CCHF virus (see 20101117.4170); this seemed doubtful, but
our RFI has remained unanswered so far.

The OIE convened a meeting of an experts ad-hoc group on camelidae
diseases, which met at the organisation's headquarters in Paris from
8-10 Jul 2008. The group's useful report included, among other items,
the following observations:

"a. Knowledge of camelid diseases is limited; more research is
necessary to elucidate the role of some pathogens mentioned in the
epidemiology and pathogenesis of the following diseases in camelids:

1. Viral diseases: bluetongue, African horse sickness, Rift Valley
fever, bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD), West Nile fever, herpesvirus
infection, CCHF.
2. Bacterial diseases: pasteurellosis, leptospirosis, Q fever, chlamydiosis.
3. Parasitic diseases: toxoplasmosis, sarcosporidiosis, trypanosomes.
4. Multifactorial diseases: neonatal diarrhoea, respiratory syndrome,
abortion, unknown mortalities.

b. Camelid susceptibility and epidemiological investigations should
be carried out for the following diseases: bluetongue, RVF, West Nile
fever, BVD, pasteurellosis, leptospirosis, Q fever, toxoplasmosis."

If bronchopneumonia is, as is apparent from the above media report, a
clear/major part of the syndrome currently observed in the Cholistan
event, 3 of the above listed disease entities may become candidates:
bluetongue, pasteurellosis and respiratory syndrome.

If the scope of the disease killing Pakistani camels, and the
relevant financial losses, are as serious as alleged, the authorities
are expected to perform an appropriate epidemiological investigation,
backed by laboratory involvement. - Mod.AS]
