[Ref: Stokstad, E: Field research on bees raises concern about low-dose pesticides. Science 2012; 335(6076): 1555 doi: 10.1126/science.335.6076.1555]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Five years ago, bees made headlines when a mysterious condition called colony collapse disorder decimated honey bee colonies in parts of the United States [Science 2007; 316(5827): 970-2]. Now bees are poised to be in the news again, this time because of evidence that systemic insecticides, a common way to protect crops, indirectly harm these important pollinators. 2 field studies reported online this week in Science document problems (http://scim.ag/MHenry, http://scim.ag/Whitehorn). In bumble bees, exposure to one such chemical leads to a dramatic loss of queens and could help explain the insects' decline. In honey bees, another insecticide interferes with the foragers' ability to find their way back to the hive.

Researchers say these findings are cause for concern and will increase pressure to improve pesticide testing and regulation. "It's going to cause an absolute firestorm," predicts James Cresswell, an ecotoxicologist at the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom, who was not involved in the research. Bayer CropScience, the main producer of systemic pesticides, maintains that its products are not a culprit in honey bee declines, and many independent experts aren't convinced by the evidence against pesticides, adding that pathogens and parasites are the main problem.

In the United States alone, 59 million hectares [146 million acres] of crops are protected by systemic pesticides. Seeds are treated with these neurotoxins before planting, and the poison suffuses the tissues, pollen, and nectar. Typical levels of imidacloprid, the most common of a family of widely used pesticides called neonicotinoids, are not lethal to bees, according to a meta-analysis by Cresswell published in Ecotoxicology last year [2011]. But there is growing evidence from laboratory experiments that neonicotinoids can harm memory and navigation in bees. However, realistic field tests were lacking.

David Goulson, a bumble bee biologist at the University of Stirling in the United Kingdom, and colleagues have now studied the bumble bee _Bombus terrestris_ under seminatural conditions. Mimicking the bees' exposure to imidacloprid in canola, they fed bumble bees a controlled diet in the laboratory. 25 colonies received pollen treated with 6 parts per billion of the pesticide. Another 25 colonies got double that dose, and 25 more served as a control. After 2 weeks, the blooming period for canola, the researchers placed the colonies in a field for 6 weeks to forage on gardens, wildflowers, and a variety of crops.

At the end of the experiment, the hives with the bees that had eaten the imidacloprid in the lab weighed 8 to 12 percent less than the 25 untreated hives -- an indication that the bees had gathered less food and produced fewer workers. The most important difference was the number of queens produced; the control hives averaged 13 queens, compared with 2 and 1.4 in the treated hives. "That is quite dramatic," Dennis van Engelsdorp of the University of Maryland, College Park, says. It suggests that pesticides may be contributing to the decline of bumble bees, which are already suffering from habitat loss.

Tjeerd Blacquiere of Plant Research International in Wageningen, the Netherlands, who was not involved in the study, says Goulson's results are probably a worst case scenario because the affected bumble bees were forced to consume only one kind of pollen -- pesticide tainted -- in the lab, whereas they would probably have a choice in the wild, thus lowering the dose. Why the hives produced fewer queens isn't clear, but Goulson says that if imidacloprid hinders the navigation ability of the foragers, they might not have gathered enough food for the queen to reproduce more queens.

Foraging problems are exactly what Axel Decourtye of the Association for Technical Coordination in Agriculture in Avignon, France, and his colleagues found in a field study of honey bees. Decourtye's team glued tiny radio-frequency tags to the backs of 653 honey bees. Up to 43.2 percent of the bees given a sublethal dose of thiamethoxam didn't return to the hive, depending on how far away the bees were released and how unfamiliar the terrain, compared with 16.9 percent of untreated bees. "We were quite surprised by the magnitude of the effect," co-author Mickael Henry of the French National Institute for Agricultural Research in Avignon says.

The team plugged the mortality rates into a model of honey bee population dynamics and found that many colonies would dwindle. Jeffrey Pettis of the US Department of Agriculture in Beltsville, Maryland, doubts that the mortality rates would cause colony collapse disorder or other loss of hives, but says that he is a co-author of a study nearing publication that will strengthen the case that neonicotinoids can harm hives. Other unpublished work shows an impact on native, solitary bees, he says.

David Fischer, an ecotoxicologist at Bayer CropScience in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, says both studies used doses that were higher than what he thinks is present in crops. Nailing down the actual levels should be a priority, Cresswell says.

The findings reinforce the recommendations of a major report [http://www.setac.org/sites/default/files/executivesummarypollinators_11oct2011.pdf], issued last September [2011] under the auspices of the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry [SETAC] and written by scientists from universities, industry, and regulatory agencies. They called for more sensitive tests, such as feeding pesticides to larvae and immature bees, and including bumble bees and native bees as well. Regulatory agencies are starting to move, if slowly. The European Food Safety Authority is considering new guidelines for risk assessments of pesticides for bees. For its part, the US Environmental Protection Agency will convene a scientific advisory panel to address similar questions in the fall.

Pesticides hit queen bee numbers
------------------------
Some of the world's most commonly used pesticides are killing bees by damaging their ability to navigate and reducing numbers of queens, research suggests. Scientific groups in the UK and France studied the effects of neonicotinoids, which are used in more than 100 nations on farm crops and in gardens.

The UK team found the pesticides caused an 85 percent drop in queen production. Writing in the journal Science, the groups note that bee declines in many countries are reducing crop yields. In the UK alone, pollination is calculated to be worth about GBP 430m [USD 689m] to the national economy. And the US is among countries where a succession of local populations has crashed, a syndrome known as colony collapse disorder [CCD]. Many causes have been suggested, including diseases, parasites, reduction in the range of flowers growing wild in the countryside, pesticides, or a combination of them all.

The neonicotinoids investigated in the 2 Science papers are used on crops such as cereals, oilseed rape, and sunflowers. Often the chemical is applied to seeds before planting. As the plant grows, the pesticide is contained in every part of it, deterring insect pests such as aphids. But it also enters the pollen and nectar, which is how it can affect bees.

Dave Goulson from the UK's University of Stirling and colleagues studied the impact of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid on bumblebees. They let bees from some colonies feed on pollen and sugar water containing levels of imidacloprid typically found in the wild, while others received a natural diet. Then they placed the colonies out in the field. After 6 weeks, colonies exposed to the pesticide were lighter than the others, suggesting that workers had brought back less food to the hive. But the most dramatic effect was on queen production. The naturally-fed hives produced around 14 queens each -- those exposed to the pesticide, just 2.

Pollination is calculated to be worth about GBP 430m [USD 689m] to the UK economy "I wouldn't say this proves neonicotinoids are the sole cause of the problems bees face," said Dr Goulson, "but it does suggest they're likely to be one of the causes, and possibly a significant one. The use of these pesticides is so widespread that most bee colonies in areas of arable farming are likely to be exposed to them, so there is potential for them to be playing a significant role in suppression of bee populations on a pretty staggering scale."

The French research group investigated the impact of a different neonicotinoid, thiamethoxam, on the number of bees able to make it back to the colony after release. Using tiny tags attached to the bees' backs, they showed that significantly fewer insects came back if they had previously been exposed to levels of thiamethoxam that they might encounter on farms. Calculations showed the impairment was bad enough that the capacity of colonies survive could be severely compromised.

"What we found is that actually if colonies are exposed to pesticides, the population might decline to a point that would put them at risk of collapse due to other stressors," said lead scientist Mickael Henry from the French National Institute for Agricultural Research (Inra) in Avignon.

Dr Henry told BBC News that it was time for authorities to re-design the safety tests that pesticides have to pass. "To date, the tests mostly require that the doses found in nature do not kill bees," he said. "But those authorisation processes ignore possible consequences for the behaviour of bees, and we hope the people in charge will be more careful."

Neonicotinoids are a multi-billion dollar business worldwide. Even though some countries have banned them partially, a complete global prohibition, as some environmental groups advocate, might be impossible. May Berenbaum, head of entomology at the University of Illinois and one of the leading US experts on CCD, said the chemicals should be used more carefully. "There is no question that neonicotinoids are being used recklessly, for want of a better word," she said. "50 years of experience should have taught us that overuse of a single class of compounds is an inherently unsustainable practice, and that pre-treating seeds when pest problems might not even be present is colossally unwise. But neonicotinoids could be banned everywhere in the world, and honeybees would still have problems with pathogens, parasites, habitat degradation and overuse of just about every other class of chemical pesticide."

At EU level, the Agriculture and Rural Development Committee has asked the European Commission to increase research and produce an action plan to conserve bees. "When the action plan is produced, we are ready to give member states a deadline to use or not use a specific pesticide -- until then it is up to individual states," said Paolo de Castro MEP, the committee's chairman.

In the UK context, Dr Goulson added, it would certainly be worth re-considering neonicotinoid use in gardens. "Personally I would ban insecticides completely in gardens," he said. "There are very few serious insect pests in Britain as far as gardening's concerned, it's too cold; and if roses have a few aphids on, then tough, it's not a big deal." His research team now plans to expand their study to other bee species, while Dr Henry's group will try to discover exactly how thiamethoxam does its damage.

[A thorough review of colony collapse disorder (last updated on 21 Mar 2012) is available from Wikipedia at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony_collapse_disorder.

Astute observers of nature, and sharp readers have already suggested this possibility. Now it seems there is some measure of proof. Likely this will ignite a firestorm on how pesticides are approved, and more studies about how plants absorb and distribute pesticides will be required.

So even if this is the cause of CCD, which it may or may not be, taking this type of pesticide off the market will not result in a sudden rebound. Rebuilding or restoring is never as rapid as the destruction. Furthermore, while this may lend some evidence to the situation, it does not seem to explain why it all seemed to happen in a very short time.

Since bee CCD and white nose syndrome (WNS) in bats seemed to happen upon the scene at about the same time, I wonder if the pesticides have a connection with the bats. - Mod.TG]
