A total of 6 people from Makoni District in Manicaland Province have been admitted to hospital while 27 others were treated and discharged after they ate cattle carcasses infected with anthrax. A visit by The Herald to Makoni District yesterday [3 Jan 2014] revealed that several families from Rugoyi, Chimbike, Chikuruwo and Karani villages ate the meat before and during the festive season.

One of the victims said she bought the meat in Dope for USD 1 per portion before feasting on it with 5 other family members. "I do not even know which animal made me sick, since several people were slaughtering and selling their cattle after realising that they were sick. I bought the meat for USD 1 a portion on several days and we feasted together with my family before falling sick the following day," she said.

[The victim] said all hell broke loose on New Year's Day [1 Jan 2014], when she developed a pimple on her head, which she initially thought was a mosquito bite. She said the pimple grew bigger by the day to the size of a medium sized guava before it developed into a sore. She said the following day [2 Jan 2014] her left eye was swollen, prompting her to seek medical attention from a nearby clinic.

"When I arrived here (Makoni Rural District Hospital) I did not know that it [was] anthrax. I only knew that I bought meat from an animal which was slaughtered by its owners because of ill health. So all these animals which have been dying here were dying of anthrax?" she questioned this reporter with a puzzled face.

[The victim] has since received treatment and was discharged, but the other family members were still to seek medical attention. "I didn't know that what we are experiencing is as a result of the meat we consumed. When I go back, I am going to encourage them to seek help," she said.

Another victim of the disease was a 4-month-old baby who got infected after she was fed with sadza [a cooked cornmeal porridge] and soup from meat prepared from the infected carcass. The mother said she started noticing a huge ulcer with a blackish centre on the baby's chest and her whole body started to swell. "This got me frightened and I rushed to the hospital for assistance. Upon arrival at the hospital, the baby was diagnosed [with] anthrax and received treatment," she said. [The mother] said what puzzled her was that only the baby got sick, yet the whole family ate meat from the carcass.

[A man] of Muhonde Village blamed veterinary officers for failing to vaccinate their animals on time and to provide enough chemicals for cattle dipping. He said their animals were only dipping once every month, yet previously they dipped every week. He said they were also being told that there were not enough chemicals to vaccinate against livestock diseases. "It is so painful to lose an animal that you invested so much in," he said.

Government has since dispatched a team of health experts to Manicaland Province to assess and address the situation in both Makoni and Nyanga, where there is a typhoid outbreak.

Director of Epidemiology and Disease Control in the Ministry of Health and Child Care, Dr Portia Manangazira, said an unprecedented number of villagers from Makoni District were exposed to anthrax, and what health centres are seeing could be a fraction of the actual burden.

She said 6 of the villagers who also ate the meat are seriously ill and receiving treatment at Rusape General Hospital. "A response team has been activated in response to these events. The team has been in contact with the directorate for Manicaland whose team is already on the ground," Dr Manangazira said.

She said the 1st case of anthrax was reported on [20 Dec 2013].

Anthrax is a life-threatening infectious disease that normally affects animals, especially ruminants such as goats, cattle, sheep, and horses. Anthrax could be transmitted to humans by contact with infected animals or their products. Its symptoms include a raised itchy bump (resembling an insect bite). Within 1-2 days the bump develops into a painless ulcer (typically 1-3 cm in diameter) with a distinguishing black, necrotic centre. Nearby lymph glands usually swell within 7 days. Flu-like symptoms, such as headache, fever, chills, and malaise may accompany swelling.

[There was a 2nd report yesterday [5 Jan 2014], but it provided little information, new or old: http://www.theglobaldispatch.com/anthrax-tainted-meat-the-source-of-zimbabwe-outbreak-33-people-affected-62351/.

I posted the whole Herald report as it provides a wealth of information, mainly because the interviewees know little of this disease and therefore spoke just of what they saw or witnessed. (Keep this in mind when interviewing "experts.") One victim said that she bought a number of portions of meat but only got sick once and then had a cutaneous lesion on her head somewhere in relation to her left eye. She clearly had handled the meat while cutting it up and scratched her head with a bloody finger. Though family members were exposed to the cooked meat, none at that time were ill. Seemingly the cooking was at a high enough temperature and long enough to kill the organisms. G/I (gastrointestinal) anthrax, in my experience, tends to both have a short incubation period and, not infrequently, is lethal. So far, it would seem that they were lucky.

A 2nd victim was the infant with a chest cutaneous lesion from, I suspect, her mother, who may have been helping with the cooking and preparation. There is a parallel to this in the 2001 anthrax-letter cases of an infant with a skin lesion who had been taken to visit a journalist parent at one of the letter receiving sites -- another reason for washing your hands before handling babies.

Any G/I cases will be among the 6 hospitalised cases, and the remaining 27 are probably all (treated and released) cutaneous cases.

The G/I attack rate for anthrax is variable. Firstly, the more under-cooked the food is, the more likely you are to have cases; over-cooked meat is in a manner of speaking "safe," not that I would want to experiment with it. Secondly, at-risk communities from repeated non-lethal exposures develop immunity. This has the tragic outcome in rural impoverished areas to encourage people to eat meat from sick animals as they know others, friends and relatives, who have eaten such meat and did not die. In regions where meat is eaten only a few times each year and it is suddenly available and cheap, it is bought. Note the victim's comment, "I bought the meat for USD 1 a portion on several days and we feasted together with my family." Remember livestock die from many diseases -- clostridial infections are much more common than anthrax -- and very few are as lethal as anthrax.

Anthrax appears to be a seasonal event in Makoni, as they had a similar outbreak there in January of last year (2013); see 20130112.1494637. Obviously, there are structural problems there with the effectiveness of the veterinary service and the availability of livestock vaccine.
