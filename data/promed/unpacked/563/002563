[1] Expanded recall

The Diamond Pet Foods voluntary recall on some of their pet food brands has been expanded after a salmonellosis outbreak in one of their plants left 14 people sick in 9 states. The dog food in question was manufactured in Gaston, South Carolina plant. At least 5 people were hospitalized from handling the food, the CDC told the Associated Press.

On the official website for the recall, Diamond Pet Foods added dog food under the Country Value, Diamond, Premium Edge, Professional, 4Health, and Taste of the Wild brands with a 2 or 3 in the 9th position of the production code and an X in the 10th or 11th position. The "best before" dates are between 9 Dec 2012 and 7 Apr 2013. They were distributed in a variety of eastern, southern, central and Midwest states, as well as parts of Canada, but may appear in other states.

Diamond Naturals (particularly the Lamb & Rice dry dog formula), Chicken Soup for the Pet Lover's Soul Adult Light Formula and Diamond Puppy Formula had already been recalled in April 2011 after a random sampling showed that some of their food tested positive for salmonellae. Some companies that co-manufacture with Diamond Pet Foods have also pulled their products, including Natural Balance, Kirkland Signature/Kirkland Signature Nature's Domain, Apex Pet Foods, Canidae Pet Foods, and one type of Wellness Complete Health puppy food. The companies claim it is a precaution because no pet or human illnesses have been reported in association with these brands nor has sample testing shown that any of their bags have salmonellae.

Reuters reported that the CDC are investigating the outbreak. The infection is possibly from people touching the dog food and then touching their own food, cross-contamination with products that touched the tainted pet food, or from direct contact from a dog that had a salmonellosis infection.

[2] Canadian (Quebec) case

Several people in the USA and one person in Canada have become ill with a _Salmonella_ Infantis infection as a result of contact with pets or pet food contaminated with _Salmonella_ bacteria. A manufacturer in the USA, Diamond Pet Foods, has recalled several batches of its dry pet food due to possible contamination, including pet food that was shipped to Canada.

The affected pet food was distributed to British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec, and New Brunswick and may have been distributed to other provinces and territories.

The single Canadian case of illness is from Quebec.

[The recall of the dog food has expanded to include co-manufactured brands. Additionally, a human infection has been documented in the province of Quebec in Canada as well as the cases reported in the USA (see ProMED-mail 20120504.1122720). Despite the statements made by the producer, the human isolates have a PFGE pattern indistinguishable from _S._ Infantis that was isolated from the unopened bag of dry dog food produced by Diamond Pet Foods.
