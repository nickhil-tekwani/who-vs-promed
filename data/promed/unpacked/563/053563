From: Steve Berger <mberger@post.tau.ac.il>

The following data on dengue in Guadeloupe were abstracted from the GIDEON
software program:
Dengue is the only mosquito-borne disease in Guadeloupe, and _Aedes
aegypti_ is the sole vector. Annual rates as high as 100/100,000 have been
recorded.
Year Number reported
1984 339
1985 216
1986 120
1988 41
1989 37
1990 12
1991 51
1992 75
A subsequent outbreak was reported in 1994, and two cases of DHF (1 fatal)
were reported in 1995.

[DHF = dengue hemorrhagic fever. It would be even more useful if GIDEON
could give us the information on the type(s) circulating in each -- or any
-- year. - Mod.JW
[You're right...but we just don't have this data [in the GIDEON database.
When we
started filling in ALL years for ALL countries, we simply gave up addition
of strain information. Sorry - Steve
