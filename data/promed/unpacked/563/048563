DENGUE, IMPACT OF HURRICANE - MEXICO

[News reports have speculated that a damage from a recent hurricane in
Mexico has increased the risk of an outbreak of dengue fever. - Mod.ES

From: Reiter, Paul I. <ipr1@cdc.gov>

On two past occasions (after hurricane Hugo in Puerto Rico and after
Marlene in the US Virgin Islands) we made careful surveys to determine what
proportion of larval sites were attributable to the hurricane. In both
cases the results were similar: indices were very high, but only a small
portion of sites positive had NOT been present before the storm. For
example (from memory) Breteau indices for St. Croix and St. Thomas in the
devastated areas were around 140, but without the larval sites produced by
the storm the Breteaux would still have been 120. Moreover, in areas with
moderate damage, we concluded that the post-storm clean-up had actually
done what we exhort people to do in normal times: they had disposed of
many containers!
I am not familiar with Acapulco, but from what I see in news reports, the
worst affected areas are also the poorest. I am guessing, but I suspect
that living conditions before the hurricane probably included domestic
water storage. Trash disposal may not have been optimal, though we have
observed that among very poor communities there are [fewer discarded
containers. Exposure to mosquitoes (unscreened homes, no air conditioning)
will not have changed much. Therefore I would not be surprised if the
disaster did NOT change the dengue picture.
The picture may be different for the wealthier neighborhoods, but I doubt
that any major change in the dengue picture has occurred.
One factor that always seems to get forgotten: time. Even if the number of
containers is drastically increased, it takes at least 2 weeks for the
first new brood of adults to appear. [It could take much longer because
new sites are relatively clean and free of nutrients. For the adult
population to increase significantly, we are talking months, not over night
as the press seems to surmise. If the period after the disaster is dry,
many of the sites may not last that long. The same goes for malaria: yes,
ground pools are abundant after the storm, but how long do they last if
there are not new storms to replenish them.
To conclude, I would be much more concerned about enteric diseases, from
sewage pollution of the water supply, and rodent-borne diseases, especially
leptospirosis. Unfortunately, the pressures on health authorities in these
circumstances demand that something [with high visibility is being done!
Vector borne diseases offer the chance to use highly visible air spray or
vehicle-based spray operations.
I [have discussed this with Duane Gubler [CDC, Ft. Collins, CO, and he is
in agreement with the above. In addition, he noted that severe storms and
flooding often
increase adult mosquito mortality and wash away many larval habitats so the
risk of transmission may actually be lower in the immediate aftermath of a
storm. Lastly, he pointed out that dengue epidemics which have been
documented in the aftermath of hurricanes have been attributable to a large
influx of nonimmune disaster relief workers, as happened, for example, in
St. Croix after Hurricane Hugo in 1989.
