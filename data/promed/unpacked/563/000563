The slaughter order followed the killing of 3,000 pigs on Monday. Swine
fever is a highly infectious porcine disease which is not harmful to
humans.
Farm authorities imposed a quarantine area around the Westphalian village
of Warendorf, where the original outbreak was reported. Around 70 farms may
not be sell or slaughter pigs until November 3. A further 500 pig farms are
under observation.
Officials said the disease spread after a batch of 257 piglets was
delivered from Warendorf to Vechta in Lower Saxony. The neighbouring
village of Cloppenburg has also been hit by the disease, and further areas
are under observation.
The Dutch Agriculture Ministry said it was tightening controls on the
import of German pigs following the outbreak. All swine imported from
Germany will be tested for the disease twice, at an interval of four weeks,
and may not be transported in the meantime.
