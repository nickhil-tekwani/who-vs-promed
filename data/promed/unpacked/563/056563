Top End residents and visitors have been urged to take extra precautions to guard against a deadly tropical disease after a surge in cases.

Melioidosis, which is found in soil and water, can enter the human body through cuts and sores, Northern Territory Health says. The infectious disease, which is also called Whitmore's disease, can also be inhaled through dust or droplets, especially during tropical storms.

"This wet season's high rainfall has led to a 50% increase in the number of melioidosis cases expected," Vicki Krause, director of the Centre for Disease Control, said. On average, the territory records 32 cases of melioidosis each wet season. So far this season, 48 cases have been reported. People are more likely to come in contact with the potentially deadly bacteria during the wet season, Dr. Krause said. That's when they're found in soil surface layers and muddy waters.

It can infect humans or animals but isn't usually passed from one person to another or from animals to humans. "Melioidosis most often causes infection of the lungs, ranging from mild bronchitis to severe pneumonia," she said. "In severe cases, it can lead to blood infection, with around 10% of infections causing death."

Melioidosis can also cause symptoms, such as fevers, cough, shortness of breath, weight loss, fatigue, abdominal pain, urinary symptoms, non-healing wounds, and sores. It may be mistaken for other diseases, such as tuberculosis or more common forms of pneumonia. Symptoms usually develop within 3 weeks of exposure to the bacteria, but in some cases, illness may not occur until several months or years after the initial infection. People with underlying health conditions are more likely to develop melioidosis. This includes those with conditions that lower immunity, such as diabetes, cancer, heavy alcohol intake, advanced age, and kidney and lung disease. Precautions, such as covering sores and abrasions with waterproof dressings, wearing waterproof footwear outdoors, and staying indoors during heavy wind and rain, should also be taken to avoid the disease.

Melioidosis is caused by the bacterium _Burkholderia pseudomallei_. It is predominantly a disease of tropical climates, especially in southeast Asia and northern Australia, where it is widespread.

[Melioidosis is a disease of the rainy season in its endemic areas. It mainly affects people who have direct contact with soil and water. Many have an underlying predisposing condition such as diabetes (commonest risk factor), renal disease, cirrhosis, thalassemia, alcohol dependence, immunosuppressive therapy, chronic obstructive lung disease, cystic fibrosis, and excess kava consumption. Kava is an herbal member of the pepper family that can be associated with chronic liver disease.

Melioidosis may present at any age, but peaks in the 4th and 5th decades of life, affecting men more than women. In addition, although severe fulminating infection can and does occur in healthy individuals, severe disease and fatalities are much less common in those without risk factors.

The most commonly recognized presentation of melioidosis is pneumonia, associated with high fever, significant muscle aches, chest pain, and -- although the cough can be nonproductive -- respiratory secretions can be purulent, significant in quantity, and associated with on-and-off bright, red blood. The lung infection can be rapidly fatal -- with bacteremia and shock -- or somewhat more indolent.

Acute melioidosis septicemia is the most severe complication of the infection. It presents as a typical sepsis syndrome with hypotension, high cardiac output, and low systemic vascular resistance. In many cases, a primary focus in the soft tissues or lung can be found. The syndrome, usually in patients with risk factor comorbidities, is characteristically associated with multiple abscesses involving the cutaneous tissues, the lung, the liver, and spleen, and a very high mortality rate of 80-95%. With prompt optimal therapy, the case fatality rate can be decreased to 40-50%.

The melioidosis bacillus is intrinsically insensitive to many antimicrobials. It should be noted that bioterrorism strains may be engineered to be even more resistant. _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ is usually inhibited by tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT), antipseudomonal penicillins, carbapenems, ceftazidime, and amoxicillin/clavulanate or ampicillin/sulbactam. Ceftriaxone and cefotaxime have good in vitro activity but poor efficacy and cefepime did not appear, as well, to be equivalent to ceftazidime in a mouse model. The unusual antimicrobial profile of resistance to colistin and polymyxin B and the aminoglycosides but sensitivity to amoxicillin/clavulanate is a useful tool to consider in the treatment of infection with the organism.

The randomized and quasi-randomized trials comparing melioidosis treatment have been reviewed, and it was found that the formerly standard therapy of chloramphenicol, doxycycline and SXT combination had a higher mortality rate than therapy with ceftazidime, imipenem/cilastatin, or amoxicillin/clavulanate (or ampicillin/sulbactam). The betalactam-betalactamase inhibitor therapy, however, seemed to have a higher failure rate.
