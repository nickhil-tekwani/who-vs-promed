_Banana streak virus_ identified for the first time in Peru in Cavendish
banana (_Musa_ AAA)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In October of 2005, a field survey was done in the province of Piura in
northern Peru to determine the cause of a disease known locally as
"mosaico" that was affecting organic Cavendish banana (_Musa_ AAA) grown
for the export market. Disease symptoms consisted of pronounced chlorotic
and necrotic lesions on leaves of affected plants. A total of 24 farms were
visited and, at each location, 10 randomly selected plants at flowering
stage were evaluated for disease incidence and severity. Plants showing
virus-like symptoms were observed in 18 of the 24 locations (75 per cent).
A total of 52 banana leaf samples, 27 from plants showing virus-like
symptoms and 25 from asymptomatic plants, were tested for the presence of
_Banana streak virus_ (BSV), _Cucumber mosaic virus_ (CMV), and _Banana
mild mosaic virus_ (BanMMV) by immunosorbent electron microscopy (ISEM)
using partially purified leaf tissue extracts (2). The same extracts were
also tested by immunocapture polymerase chain reaction (IC-PCR) for
presence of BSV and specific BSV isolates (BSV-OL, BSV-GF, BSV-IM, and
BSV-CAV) using badnavirus-specific degenerate primers and BSV
isolate-specific primers, respectively (1). Of 27 leaf samples showing
virus-like symptoms, 17 (63 per cent) tested positive for BSV by ISEM and
IC-PCR using badnavirus, but not isolate-specific, primers. The symptoms on
the 10 samples that tested negative were not typical of BSV infection. One
asymptomatic leaf sample (4 per cent) also tested positive for BSV. To
validate the PCR results, the nucleotide sequence from a plant showing the
most prevalent foliar symptom type was determined. This sequence had up to
86 per cent homology to the corresponding polyprotein region of BSV and
other badnaviruses. Neither CMV nor BanMMV was detected in any of the 52
samples tested.
From these results, it was concluded that "mosaico" disease of organic
Cavendish bananas in northern Peru is associated frequently with BSV
infection and that there is a high incidence of BSV infection in this area.
To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of BSV occurrence in Peru. It was
both surprising and interesting that neither BSV-OL nor BSV-GF, the 2 BSV
isolates found most commonly in banana (_Musa_ AAA) and plantain (_Musa_
AAB) in South and Central America, was detected in Cavendish banana in
northern Peru. Failure to detect BSV-OL and BSV-GF suggests that field
infection may be due to vertical transmission by clonal propagation rather
than to horizontal transmission from local plantain and that control of
"mosaico" disease could therefore be achieved by use of virus-free planting
material.

[_Banana streak virus_ (BSV; genus _Badnavirus_) affects _Musa_ spp.
(banana and plantain) only. It was 1st reported from Morocco and has since
been recorded in a number of other banana growing areas worldwide. Symptoms
are chlorotic leaf streaks and necrosis and some strains can cause the
death of the heart leaf and pseudostem. Symptoms tend to be more severe in
poorly managed plants and the effect on yield may be small under optimal
plant growth conditions. Infected plants may even be symptomless, which
makes disease management difficult. BSV is thought to be transmissible by
mealybugs, and diseased plant material (including suckers from cut down
infected plants) may serve as a reservoir. Seed transmission has been
confirmed. The virus is not transmitted by mechanical inoculation. BSV
infection causes problems for the development of new _Musa_ hybrids in
breeding programs worldwide.
BSV is a highly variable virus with many strains of different levels of
virulence. _Banana streak GF virus_, _Banana streak Mysore virus_ (endemic
to the banana variety Mysore (ABB) in Australia), and _Banana streak OL
virus_ are now classified as separate related species. Diagnosis relies on
molecular methods.
_Cucumber mosaic virus_ (genus _Cucumovirus_) is insect-transmitted and has
a wide range of host species including banana. _Banana mild mosaic virus_
is a member of the family of _Flexiviridae_ not yet assigned to a genus. It
may be insect-transmitted.
Over 30 species of wild _Musa_ have been identified from the region between
the Pacific and India. However, the majority of today's cultivated bananas
are related to either _Musa acuminata_ (A) and/or _M. balbisiana_ (B).
These varieties are mostly triploid and sterile; some diploid and partly
fertile cultivars exist as well. The specific genetic background of a
banana variety is indicated by the letters A or B, for example AAB would be
a triploid variety with 2 sets of _M. acuminata_ and one set of _M.
balbisiana_ chromosomes. New cultivars can arise by mutations (spontaneous
or by experimental mutagenesis, for example in tissue culture), or by hand
pollination between partly fertile lines.
