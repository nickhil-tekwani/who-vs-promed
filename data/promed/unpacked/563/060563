The Department of Health (DH) recorded another suspected case of EV-71
infection with complications today.
The case involved a two-year-old girl who was admitted to Kwong Wah
Hospital. She first developed symptoms of hand-foot-mouth disease followed
by meningitis. She is now in stable condition.
A DH spokesman said preliminary investigation showed no relation between
the case recorded today and yesterday. Follow-up control measures had been
taken on the patients' contacts. Visits had been made to the kindergarten
and the family to provide health education and advice on prevention of
enterovirus infection.
The spokesman said the surveillance systems set up by the Department of
Health and the Hospital Authority (HA) to monitor the trend of
hand-foot-mouth disease had continued to show a low level of such
infections in the community in the last week. Nonetheless, with the
beginning of the new school term and congregation of young children in
schools and child care centres, vigilance must be maintained in these
places to prevent enterovirus infections.
As of today, the department recorded a total of 54 confirmed cases and two
suspected cases of EV-71 infection this year. Of these, three confirmed
cases and the two suspected ones presented with neurological complications.
These three patients had recovered and were discharged. Patients of all
other confirmed EV-71 infections had made full recovery.
