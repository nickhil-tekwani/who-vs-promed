Mysterious Virus Rages in Iran
--------------------
According to Iran National Broadcasting (IRIB) on 9 Jun 2002, an
unidentified virus is threatening some 70 villages in the country's
western area. The symptoms shown were exhaustion, partial paralysis,
severe headache and nausea. A special team has been formed to
investigate the virus outbreak in March. In respond to IRIB criticism
of the Health Ministry's inappropriate measures, the
Health Ministry had conducted all the necessary lab tests and would
require some time to recognize the new virus. Otherwise the outbreak
may become uncontrollable and spread nationwide. So far, no death has
been reported.

[More information on this outbreak and its etiology would be
appreciated. The absence of any report of mortality suggests a mild
illness, albeit speculation at this point is hazardous. While the
exact geography of this outbreak is not specified, the western
borders of Iran are shared with Iraq and Turkey. - Mod. MPP]
