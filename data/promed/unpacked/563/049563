During October 2004, diseased eggplant fruit from a commercial farm in
Colquitt County, Georgia, developed circular, tan, water-soaked lesions.
Gray, septate mycelia quickly covered the fruit. Diseased fruit became
shriveled, spongy, and mummified. Disease incidence in the field was
approximately 1 percent.
_Lasiodiplodia theobromae_ (Pat.) Griffon & Maubl. (synonym _Botryodiplodia
theobromae_ Pat.) (2) was isolated from the margins of lesions and cultured
on acidified potato dextrose agar. The fungus produced grayish colonies
with aerial hyphae and black ostiolate pycnidia massed into stroma. Mature
elliptical conidia (25.8 x 15.6 micrometers) were brown, had a single
septation, and longitudinal striations. Isolates obtained from peanut and
pecan were included in the pathogenicity tests. Mature fruit cv. Nightshade
were surface disinfested for 30 s in 70 percent ethanol, followed by 60 s
in 0.5 percent sodium hypochlorite, rinsed twice in sterile distilled
water, and allowed to dry.
Inoculations were made by placing an agar plug containing _L. theobromae_
mycelial side down on the surface of the fruit or wounding with a sterile
toothpick containing mycelium of the fungus. Fruit similarly inoculated
with agar plugs or sterile toothpicks served as controls. There were a
total of 3 replicates. Fruit were placed in plastic containers lined with
moistened paper towels. Containers were placed in a dew chamber and
incubated (28 C, relative humidity >95 percent) for 3 days, and then evaluated.
Symptoms identical to those observed on naturally infected fruit developed
on inoculated fruit. Controls remained disease free. _L. theobromae_ was
reisolated from all symptomatic tissue, satisfying Koch's postulates.
Disease damage on wounded fruit was twice that of nonwounded fruit.
However, 7 of 9 inoculations with agar plugs containing _L. theobromae_
resulted in infection. Lesion lengths from wound inoculations were 9.8,
7.3, and 5.2 cm for isolates from peanut, pecan, and eggplant,
respectively. Generally, _L. theobromae_ is considered a facultative wound
pathogen or a secondary invader (3). However, this study suggests that
direct infection can occur.
Although fruit spot has been reported previously on eggplant (1), to our
knowledge, this is the 1st report verifying _L. theobromae_ as the causal
agent.

[Basically this piece confirms that _L. theobromae_ is a pathogen that
causes fruit spot on eggplant (_Solanum melongena _). Other fungal
pathogens infecting eggplant are a leaf and fruit spot caused by _Phoma_
sp., leaf spot caused by _Cercospora melongenae_ and fruit rot caused by
_Rhizopus stolonifer_). - Mod.DH]
