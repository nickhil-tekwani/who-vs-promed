City Health Department: Several Cases of Serious, Unexplained Illness on
Staten Island
----------------------------------------------------------
New York City health officials are investigating an unexplained illness --
one they describe as serious -- that has hospitalized 5 Staten Island
residents; 2 of them in critical condition.
Health Department officials say they are still not sure what kind of
infection they're looking at. They're not putting out any kind of a warning
to the public and this may simply be a coincidence. But this is what is
known so far: 5 people between the ages of 22 and 54 -- all on Staten Island -
- have been hospitalized with some kind of a viral disease, possibly
encephalitis or swelling of the brain. 4 of them remain in serious condition;
1 person has now been released.
The symptoms for this unexplained illness began in late September 2003 and
include fever, a bad headache, fatigue, malaise, and some patients have
had seizures. So far testing has ruled out SARS and West Nile Virus [and
presumably bacteria, since they are calling it a viral disease -- see above. -
Mod.JW]. Doctors and other health department officials are trying to figure
out if there's some kind of connection among these 5 individuals.
New York City has about 200 encephalitis cases a year so it's fairly rare,
and it was rare to see this small cluster on Staten Island.
