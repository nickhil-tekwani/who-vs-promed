[Maybe this conversation would be improved with some] results of
detailed genetic analysis of many or all of these various elephant
endotheliolytic cases. Partial DNA sequence analysis from blood and
necropsy tissue has been carried out and is in progress in both my
and Laura Richman's laboratories over the past decade. To follow up
on the point that Nancy Hawkes made, there is not yet a single
instance in which we can state for certain that the virus that caused
disease in one Asian juvenile elephant came from another specific
individual source animal. In fact, the viruses involved are nearly
all different from one another, in some cases hugely so at the level
of different virus species or sub-species (EEHV1A, EEHV1B, EEHV2,
EEHV3A, and EEHV3B) where some or all of the genes differ at the
level of 10 to 40 percent in the protein amino acid structure, or at
a low level (about 0.1 to 0.3 percent nucleotide differences) as
distinct non-epidemiologically related virus isolates or variants
from within the EEHV1A group itself.

These viruses all belong to the genus _Proboscivirus_, which must
have co-evolved with their mastodon/elephantid hosts ever since they
diverged from other mammalian groups. We project that the common
ancestors of EEHV1/2 diverged from the EEHV3s about 25 million years
ago, and EEHV1 and EEHV2 from each other about 10 million years ago
(note that the last common ancestors of Asian and African elephants
and the extinct woolly mammoths only diverged between 4 and 7 million
years ago).

Furthermore, to further amplify Jim Wellehan's comments, we now know
of 11 different species or sub-species of elephant herpesviruses,
which fall into 2 very different groups, the probosciviruses or
EEHVs, and the elephant gammaherpesviruses discovered by Jim
Wellehan. All 11 are found within the United States captive elephant
population and they are all certain to also occur amongst the various
wild populations of _Elephas maximas_, _Loxodonta africana_, and
_Loxodonta cyclotis_, although we know little about which elephant
species or sub-species is the natural host of which specific virus
species. Of the 6 known _Probosciviruses_, 5 have been associated
with fatal endotheliolytic disease -- 4 in Asian elephants and one in
African elephants -- whereas none of the 5 known elephant
gammaherpesviruses have yet been associated with disease, but at
least one of the latter can be detected in almost all individual
healthy elephants tested, as well as in some mucosal lesions.

With regard to specifics of the situations cited at the Woodland
Park, Dickerson Park, Rockland, and Houston zoos:
First, the species of virus that killed Hansa (EEHV3A) has only been
seen in one other case (EEHV3B), but those 2 viruses are themselves 8
percent different, whereas the 2 old cases at Rockland where Rex is
housed were both EEHV1A.

Secondly, among the 5 cases associated with Dickerson Park, Haji's
virus was a novel EEHV1A/EEHV1B chimera, and although the other 4
were all EEHV1A, we already know that Nisha's is different from
Kala's. Haji was the 1st Asian calf bred by artificial insemination
and yet we have seen no other case like it amongst the other progeny
of Onyx.

Amongst those born in Houston, Kiba's virus was EEHV1B (caught after
transfer to Berlin, and his daughter Kiri in Berlin had EEHV1A).
Also, although the sequence of the Kiba EEHV1B virus TER gene is
quoted correctly as being 97 percent identical to the EEHV1As, other
genes such as the TK are 40 percent different between EEHV1A and
EEHV1B. Amongst the other 4 cases born at Houston, we know at least
that Singgah's virus was different from those of the cases that
occurred at Rockland and at Lincoln Park, which were also both
different from each other.

Similarly, among 2 cases at Oklahoma of progeny from the same mother
and father, the 2 viruses were EEHV3B and an EEHV1. The 3 cases that
were progeny of Thai and Methai included at least 2 different viruses
(EEHV1A and EEHV1B) and the 5 cases that were progeny of Onyx have
included EEHV3B, EEHV1A, and an EEHV1B.

Finally, the rapid acute systemic course in cases of elephant
endotheliolytic disease almost certainly represents a primary
infection in an immunologically naive juvenile animal. Therefore, it
should be very obvious from the genetic analyses that the sources of
the viruses that have caused disease have rarely if ever been the
parents themselves (and are very also unlikely to be contracted from
AI), but rather instead from sporadic close contacts with either
wild-born animals that have carried their own specific virus in a
latent state since infancy (which is the natural situation for
virtually all herpesviruses within the hosts that they have
co-evolved with), or possibly in carrier Asian elephants who may have
caught and survived infection with the African EEHV1A virus
asymptomatically as infants.

[Many thanks to Gary for his insightful and detailed communication
bringing the rest of us up to date on the research in elephant
endotheliolytic diseases. Like humans, elephants seem to have their
own personal herpesviruses. Time will reveal how many of these cases
are due to a reactivation of latent herpesvirus infections. - Mod MHJ]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
As with all research, the EEHV story is evolving as we gather new
data. The more recent literature shows that EEHV1 is indeed present
in wild Asian elephant populations, associated with the same
devastating disease:
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=16841568>,
in addition to some as yet unpublished data from experts in this
field. Additionally, there is currently no data to substantiate that
EEHV2 (the herpesvirus associated with death in at least one African
elephant) originated from Asian elephants.

There is unanimous consensus among the world's leading experts that
we should continue our commitment to breeding elephants. There is no
scientific evidence to support altering our breeding plans. There is
no evidence that EEHV it is transmitted by artificial insemination.
Additionally, the several calves sired by Onyx from the Dickerson
Park Zoo that contracted EEHV include at least 3 very different
species of elephant herpesvirus, strongly arguing against a point
source from breeding activities.

We remain steadfast in our commitment to the Elephant Species
Survival Plan: contributing toward research that helps save their
wild counterparts, as habitat is eliminated by humans; ensuring the
long-term survival of the species in the North American population;
and supporting continued research on elephant herpesviruses.
