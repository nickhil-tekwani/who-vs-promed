Aid group: Measles outbreak sickens more people in North Korea
-----------------------------------------------
A measles outbreak in North Korea has sickened another 600 people in
less than a month, bringing to 3600 the total affected by the illness
since an outbreak began in November [2006], the Red Cross said in a
report released Saturday [24 Mar 2007].
The death toll from the disease, however, remains at 4 -- 2 children
and 2 adults -- said the International Federation of Red Cross and
Red Crescent Societies in a report dated Wednesday [21 Mar 2007].
The report said 1482 people have been hospitalized so far, up from
1013 as of late last month [February 2007] in the federation's
previous report, which also warned of the risk of more cases of measles.
The U.N. children's agency, UNICEF, led a vaccination campaign on
14-16 Mar [2006] in which 6 million children ages 6 months to 15
years were immunized, the report said.
A 2nd phase of the campaign is scheduled for mid-April [2007] that
will vaccinate people up to age 45, it said.
North Korea is one of the world's poorest countries, where famine
starting in the 1990s caused by natural disasters and outdated
farming methods led to the deaths of as many as 2 million people.
Measles is a highly contagious viral disease spread by airborne
droplets circulated by coughing and sneezing, according to the World
Health Organization. It is a leading cause of death among young
children, despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine
for the past 40 years. About 345 000 people, most of them children,
died from measles in 2005, the latest year for which figures are available.

DPR Korea: Measles Epidemic Appeal No. MAA54001 Operation Update No. 1
-----------------------------------------------
In Brief. (This project is an integral part of the East Asia Appeal 2006-2007)
Operations Update no. 1 Period covered: 18 Feb to 20 Mar 2007; Appeal
target: CHF 557 586 (USD 457 404 or EUR 346 112); Appeal coverage:
34.4 percent*; Outstanding needs: CHF 365 252*.
(*Figures based on the contributions list. For contributions yet to
be published, please see Table 1 below.)
Operational summary: A measles outbreak in November 2006 affected
3600 people and caused the deaths of 4 people in the DPRK [Democratic
People's Republic of Korea]. The DPRK Ministry of Public Health
(MoPH) confirmed the measles outbreak at a joint meeting attended by
UNICEF, WHO, the DPRK and Federation representatives on 16 Feb
[2007]. Further meetings resulted in a 2 phase measles immunization
joint plan of action with UNICEF as the lead agency.
DPRK Red Cross volunteers have played an important role in community
mobilization during the 1st phase of the nationwide measles
immunization campaign to vaccinate 6 million children between 6
months to 15 years old. The DPRK Red Cross Society and the Federation
are contributing 10.2 million doses of Vitamin A (Retinol, 200 000
i.u) in the 2nd phase. The Federation is also contributing 262 000
doses of ampicillin to health facilities in 4 provinces for the
treatment of measles-related complications.
Overview
Acute respiratory infections are high during the harsh winter months
in the DPRK. To protect themselves from the severe cold, people tend
to remain indoors or close together, increasing the spread of viral
and other respiratory infections. Since November 2006, 3597 people in
35 of the country's 205 counties (all 10 provinces of DPRK) were
diagnosed with measles, which led to the deaths of 2 children and 2
adults. A further 1482 people have been hospitalized as a result of
the outbreak.
Patients with the measles often suffer from skin rashes, high fever
and flu-like symptoms. Local health facilities throughout the country
provided treatment to patients with these symptoms. The DPRK Ministry
of Public Health (MoPH) confirmed the measles outbreak at a joint
meeting attended by UNICEF, WHO, the DPRK and Federation
representatives on 16 Feb [2007].
A joint plan of action resulted in a 2-phased nationwide measles
vaccination campaign for March to April [2007]. The 1st phase took
place [on] 14-16 Mar [2007] and was carried out by the MoPH and
UNICEF. Six million children between 6 months - 15 years old were
immunized. The DPRK Red Cross volunteers were part of the vaccination
teams as tally sheet recorders. The MoPH invited a team from the
national society to monitor and coordinate the immunization campaign
in one of the counties in South Pyongan province.
The 2nd phase is scheduled for mid-April [2007], and the national
society and the Federation is providing vitamin A and ampicillin
injections. These were flown into the country to ensure
pre-positioning of supplies well before the scheduled campaign.
Red Cross and Red Crescent action
The reemergence of measles, a highly contagious but completely
preventable infection, in the country is linked to the high risk of
disease outbreaks, especially among children and other vulnerable
groups still recovering from prolonged malnutrition during the winter
months. UNICEF is leading the immunization response in coordination
with the MoPH. In the joint action plan developed by UNICEF, MoPH,
the national society and the Federation, all people between 6 months
to 45 years of age will be immunized and administered with vitamin A.
The DPRK Red Cross and the Federation have in place a system for the
supply of drugs and medical materials to 2000 health institutions in
more than 60 out of 160 (accessible) counties in DPRK as part of the
national society's annual activities. This will complement the MoPH
during this nationwide campaign. The national society has also
mobilized its volunteers to support MoPH in community mobilization
and as vaccination team members. All primary- and secondary-level
health facilities are being supplied with ampicillin injections to
treat secondary bacterial infections and other complications as a
result of measles.

[There have been an additional 600 cases of measles since the
original postings on this outbreak approximately one month ago (see
references below). The 1st vaccination campaign was aimed at the
population between 6 months and 15 years of age. One would begin to
see the impact of the vaccination activities approximately 7-10 days
following the campaign, so the reports of these additional 600 cases
are not surprising, as they predate the vaccination activities. As
there have been cases of measles in the adult population, one would
not be too surprised if there were reports of additional cases during
the period preceding the vaccination activities of the adult population.
