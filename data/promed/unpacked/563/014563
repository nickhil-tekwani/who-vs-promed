King County public health officials are becoming increasingly concerned about a variety of outbreaks of serious infectious diseases among people who are homeless. Seattle-King County Public Health is investigating outbreaks of Group A _Streptococcus_, _Shigella_, and a rare group of infections transmitted by body lice among people who are homeless, as well as monitoring a potential outbreak of hepatitis A, a potentially fatal disease that spread in San Diego.

"The fact that we're seeing multiple, different infections now increasing in the homeless population is an indicator of the sheer increase in the number of homeless people (in King County) and the fact that they're in crowded conditions with poor hygiene and sanitation," said Dr. Jeff Duchin, health officer for Public Health -- Seattle & King County.

At a King County Board of Health meeting on [Thu 15 Mar 2018], Dr. John Lynch, medical director of infection prevention and control at Harborview Medical Center, said at least 2 people have died since January 2018 when group A strep [_Streptococcus_], which can be spread through open wounds, become necrotizing fasciitis, more commonly known as "flesh eating disease". It is unclear if those cases were among people who are homeless; case reviews are ongoing. But strep A cases at Harborview nearly doubled between 2016 and 2017, to 219 cases in 2017, and "almost all are happening among homeless people," Lynch said. "It's incredibly concerning. We're seeing it on the front lines at Harborview," said Lynch.

The county board of health passed a resolution on [Thu 15 Mar 2018] urging more sanitation and hygiene services for unsheltered homeless people. At the meeting, Seattle officials described their efforts to increase toilets, hot water and hand-washing stations at the city's 6 sanctioned encampments, and to bring hand-washing kits to the city's many unsanctioned camps. But Seattle City Councilmember Sally Bagshaw urged more such services. "This is what happens to people if you don't have places where you can wash, get cleaned up," she said.

In addition to strep A, public health officials issued an advisory in February 2018 about outbreaks of shigellosis, a highly contagious diarrheal illness, and from _Bartonella quintana_, an infection known as "trench fever" when it spread among World War I soldiers. It is spread by body lice and can result in fevers and rashes or more serious infections of the heart or blood vessels.

There has been an average of 89 cases a year of shigellosis in King County since 2013, but the number of reported rose to 164 cases in 2017. Most of the cases are among people who are housed, and have been uncommon among homeless people, but there have been 8 cases of among homeless people in King County since December 2017, compared to an average of 3 cases per year over the past 5 years, according to public health data.

A total of 3 cases of _Bartonella quintana_ have been identified among people who are homeless since mid-2017.

In addition, Lynch said the winter flu outbreak arrived a month early and hit homeless people unusually hard, and a particular strain of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a highly contagious virus, had spread through homeless people.

Duchin, the public health officer, emphasized that the county's homeless population was already experiencing a health crisis, even before the uptick in these illnesses. Homeless people have life spans that are decades shorter than housed people. "That's alarming," Duchin said. "Homeless people suffer from poor health across every health condition that you can imagine."

The public health advisories in February [2018] were issued just as homeless advocates protested Seattle's decision to reduce funding for some hygiene and emergency services for that population, as part of a structural shift in Seattle's homeless spending. As part of that restructuring, more emergency shelters are offering hygiene and shower facilities, but funding for stand-alone hygiene centers for homeless people was reduced until the Seattle City Council restored 1 million USD in funding in February 2018.

According to 2017's one-night count, more than 5485 homeless people were unsheltered in King County, which has doubled since 2013.

The city's Navigation Team, which does outreach to people living in the city's unauthorized homeless encampments, often look for conditions that could spread infectious diseases -- and it is one of the reasons the city can justify removing a camp. Needles and human waste are common in some of these camps.

Duchin noted that _shigella_ is spread in the same ways as hepatitis A, and it remains a concern in Seattle since a massive outbreak of the disease spread through California's homeless population in the fall of 2017, killing at least 21 people. At least one case of hepatitis A has been reported in a homeless person in Seattle, but officials believe the patient had no context with homeless encampments or shelters in the region. "The fact that we are seeing a shigellosis outbreak in our population is a reminder that hepatitis A could spread just as easily if it's introduced," he said.

["Sanctioning" encampments of the homeless should certainly come with providing basic hygienic services to prevent the transmission of infectious diseases which can spread from person-to-person by direct contact, by fecal-oral transmission or by the respiratory route depending on the specific organism. As was done by San Diego county in dealing with the large hepatitis A outbreak in southern California, it can be necessary to change the paradigm in addressing the problems of these disenfranchised people. Often, only when the infection spills over from a underserved population into the general [voting] public will politicians get involved.

Human infections with _Bartonella quintana_, spread by the body louse, perhaps more correctly referred to as the clothing louse since it lives primarily on clothing and transfers itself to the human body for blood meals, are being increasingly recognized, especially in the homeless.

The problem of louse-borne infections in the homeless is addressed in the following publication:
Leibler JH, Zakhour CM, Gadhoke P and Gaeta JM: Zoonotic and vector-borne infections among urban homeless and marginalized people in the United States and Europe, 1990-2014. Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis. 2016 Jul;16(7):435-44.

Abstract
--------
"Introduction: In high-income countries, homeless individuals in urban areas often live in crowded conditions with limited sanitation and personal hygiene. The environment of homelessness in high-income countries may result in intensified exposure to ectoparasites and urban wildlife, which can transmit infections. To date, there have been no systematic evaluations of the published literature to assess vector-borne and zoonotic disease risk to these populations.

"Objectives: The primary objectives of this study were to identify diversity, prevalence, and risk factors for vector-borne and zoonotic infections among people experiencing homelessness and extreme poverty in urban areas of high-income countries.

"Methods: We conducted a systematic review and narrative synthesis of published epidemiologic studies of zoonotic and vector-borne infections among urban homeless and very poor people in the United States and Europe from 1990 to 2014.

"Results: 31 observational studies and 14 case studies were identified (n = 45). Seroprevalence to the human louse-borne pathogen _Bartonella quintana_ (seroprevalence range: 0-37.5 percent) was identified most frequently, with clinical disease specifically observed among HIV-positive individuals. Seropositivity to _Bartonella henselae_ (range: 0-10.3 percent) and _Rickettsia akari_ (range: 0-16.2 percent) was noted in multiple studies. Serological evidence of exposure to _Rickettsia typhi_, _Rickettsia prowazekii_, _Bartonella elizabethae_, West Nile virus, _Borellia recurrentis_, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, _Wohlfartiimonas chitiniclastica_, Seoul hantavirus (SEOV), and _Leptospira_ species was also identified in published studies, with SEOV associated with chronic renal disease later in life. HIV infection, injection drug use, and heavy drinking were noted across multiple studies as risk factors for infection with vector-borne and zoonotic pathogens.

"Conclusions:: _B. quintana_ was the most frequently reported vector-borne infection identified in our article. Delousing efforts and active surveillance among HIV-positive individuals, who are at elevated risk of complication from _B. quintana_ infection, are advised to reduce morbidity. Given documented exposure to rodent-borne zoonoses among urban homeless and marginalized people, reducing human contact with rodents remains an important public health priority."

Of the organisms mentioned, only _B. quintana_ and _R. prowazekii_ are classically spread by body lice. The organisms are excreted in the "dust-like" feces of the lice and can be inoculated into the skin feeding site by excoriation caused by scratching of pruritic lesions. Well shown in _R. prowazekii_, the etiologic agent of epidemic typhus, humans can be infected via the respiratory route through aerolization of the organization's feces without being exposed directly to the infected louse.
