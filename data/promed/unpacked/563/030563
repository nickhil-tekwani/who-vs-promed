In regard to the 2 cases of infant botulism at Ft. Meade, MD, a
cut-and-paste portion of a 2003 MMWR editorial comment on a cluster
occurrence of infant botulism in Staten Island, NY was included. Your
readers should be advised that the information regarding treatment of
infant botulism contained in this 2003 quoted section is now
out-of-date and incorrect.
Specifically:
1. Human Botulism Immune Globulin (Intravenous) (BIG-IV, BabyBIG)
for the treatment of infant botulism types A and B was licensed on 23
Oct 2003 by the FDA to the California Department of Health Services
(CDHS). BabyBIG is a public service orphan drug that is available
nationwide (and internationally by special arrangement) from the
Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program, CDHS, through its
24/7 telephone number 510-231-7600. (This is not the telephone
number in the MMWR article.) Additional information on obtaining
BabyBIG, infant botulism, diagnostic specimen collection and
management may be found at the IBTPP's website,
<http://www.infantbotulism.org>.
2. Treatment with BabyBIG is based on clinical findings and should
not be delayed for laboratory confirmation of diagnosis, as early
treatment (within 0-3 days of hospital admission) shortens hospital
stay significantly more than does later (4-7 days) treatment.
3. The results of the clinical studies that qualified BIG-IV for
licensure were published last year (Arnon SS, et al:, N Engl J Med
2006;354:462-71). Treatment with BabyBIG significantly shortened
mean hospital stay and costs, intensive care unit stay, ventilator
time, and iv or tube feeding time. The specifics may be found in the
abstract appended below and in the article itself.
Background
-------
We created the orphan drug Human Botulism Immune Globulin Intravenous
(BIG-IV), which neutralizes botulinum toxin, and evaluated its safety
and efficacy in treating infant botulism, the intestinal-toxemia form
of human botulism.
Methods
------
We performed a 5-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
trial statewide, in California, of BIG-IV in 122 infants with
suspected (and subsequently laboratory-confirmed) infant botulism (75
caused by type A _Clostridium botulinum_ toxin, and 47 by type B
toxin); treatment was given within 3 days after hospital admission.
We subsequently performed a 6-year nationwide, open-label study of
382 laboratory-confirmed cases of infant botulism treated within 18
days after hospital admission.
Results
-----
As compared with the control group in the randomized trial, infants
treated with BIG-IV had a reduction in the mean length of the
hospital stay, the primary efficacy outcome measure, from 5.7 weeks
to 2.6 weeks (P less than 0.001). BIG-IV treatment also reduced the
mean duration of intensive care by 3.2 weeks (P less than 0.001), the
mean duration of mechanical ventilation by 2.6 weeks (P = 0.01), the
mean duration of tube or intravenous feeding by 6.4 weeks (P less
than 0.001), and the mean hospital charges per patient by $88 600 (in
2004 U.S. dollars; P less than 0.001). There were no serious adverse
events attributable to BIG-IV. In the open-label study, infants
treated with BIG-IV within 7 days of admission had a mean length of
hospital stay of 2.2 weeks, and early treatment with BIG-IV shortened
the mean length of stay significantly more than did later treatment.
Conclusions
-----
Prompt treatment of infant botulism type A or type B with BIG-IV was
safe and effective in shortening the length and cost of the hospital
stay and the severity of illness.
