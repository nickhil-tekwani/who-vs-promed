Organizers of the PyeongChang [Gangwon province] Winter Olympics said [Thu 8 Feb 2018] 128 cases of norovirus infections have been confirmed, with no athlete having been affected following the outbreak in the Olympic host city earlier in the week.

Citing data from the Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention, PyeongChang said 128 cases had been confirmed as of [Thu 8 Feb 2018], with 42 new cases on Thursday alone.

Of the 42 new cases, 34 are members of civil security staff. They have been quarantined and are being monitored in order to prevent any risk of spreading, the Olympic organizers said.

The contagious virus is known to cause stomach pain and diarrhea.

"Surveys on tap water, the food preparation staff, and food items are currently being conducted to trace the route of transmission," PyeongChang's organizing committee said in a statement." To address the shortfall in security workforce due to their isolation, 900 military personnel have been deployed to take over the work of the civil safety personnel. They will work across 20 venues until all affected workforce are able to return to duty."

[2] Winter Olympics, spreading

They sprang up like mushrooms atop almost every table, countertop and reasonably flat surface at the Olympic venues on Thursday afternoon [8 Feb 2018]: freshly unpacked bottles of hand sanitizer.

Lots of them.

By Thursday night, 42 more cases of norovirus were confirmed around the sites of the 2018 Winter Olympics, bringing the official tally of cases this week to 128. A mere 24 hours before the opening ceremony of the Games, the outbreak has threatened to undermine an otherwise watertight start to the global sports event.

Determined not to let the quadrennial Games spiral into a widespread gastrointestinal nightmare, the organizers on [Thu 8 Feb 2018] seemed intent on carrying out a scorched-earth assault on every last germ in a 40-mile [about 25 mi] radius.

A troupe of young volunteers wound through the news media center in the afternoon, going from office to office to distribute hundreds of bottles of 62-percent ethanol hand sanitizer.

Anyone entering the cafeteria in the athletes' village was stopped and required to take a dollop of the stuff there, too, before going anywhere near the buffet.

Competitors, Olympic staff members, and journalists claimed not to be panicking, but the quietly growing sense of wariness here was palpable. Sneezes provoked sideways looks. Fist bumps replaced handshakes. People washed their hands over and over and over again.

"We've got every-germ killing thing that you can have, just in case, and we've got masks if it gets bad enough," said an American speed skater at his 3rd Olympics.

Along with the newly omnipresent bottles of hand sanitizer, organizers have engaged in an informational campaign, with multilingual posters popping up all around the Olympic grounds.

At the media accommodations in Gangneung [also in Gangwon province], the city hosting the indoor ice events, a new flier appeared bearing the heading "Cough Etiquette & Proper Hand Washing," with a cartoon drawing of Soohorang, the smiley anthropomorphic white tiger mascot of the Games, in pain, covering his mouth with his striped left paw.

At a news conference on Wednesday night [7 Feb 2018], Dr Park Kisoo, a spokesman for the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, tried to temper the growing sense of worry [in PyeongChang]. "You don't need to go running out of the room if somebody sneezes," Park said.

Park preached the importance of proactive personal hygiene. So along with wool caps and long underwear, bottles of hand sanitizer in varying shapes and sizes have become this year's hottest Olympic accessory.

Never mind the studies showing they are largely ineffective in battling norovirus.

"The USOC [United States Olympic Committee] physician said that the antibacterial spray does not kill the norovirus," said an American curler competing in the men's and mixed-doubles events. "But what does do a good job is the Ivory soap. So he's just like, 'Soap up.'"

The buses that constitute the Olympics' internal transportation network have been running smoothly on schedule. The facilities, and the hospitality of those staffing them, have won early raves.

But the pesky virus has threatened to derail some of the early good vibes.

More than a thousand people have been quarantined as organizers have rushed to halt the spread of the virus, which can cause bouts of vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. The military was called in to provide additional support to the decimated staff.

So far 97 of the cases have been at Horeb Youth Centre, a dormitory that housed many local security staff members; 11 were in Pyeongchang; 20 were in Gangneung.

Another American speed skater and 1st-time Olympian, said these sorts of outbreaks were always a possibility at major international sporting events, where visitors from around the globe are gathered into tight quarters, day after day. "Dining halls are usually a disaster; everyone's touching everything," he said. "We've definitely gone through every precaution we can take while traveling: wiping things down with Clorox wipes, hand sanitizing, face masks, gloves, whatever we can do prevent ourselves from coming into contact with it."

His teammate, joked that the threat of illness would not throw him off his game. "If Michael Jordan can play through the flu, I can race with the virus," said the speed skater. "If I break my leg, I'm still racing."

Norovirus has popped up in Pyeongchang, South Korea, threatening to wreak havoc on the Winter Olympics. Things could get ugly fast for one simple reason: The dreaded stomach virus is very contagious.

Also known as the "winter vomiting bug," norovirus is spread -- prepare yourself -- through the "fecal-oral route," which means that a person gets infected by ingesting the stool or vomit of an infected person, often through food or touching contaminated surfaces.

On [Sun 4 Feb 2018], dozens of security guards at Olympic sites started to experience norovirus symptoms, which typically include nausea, diarrhea, stomach pain, and vomiting. They then had to be taken to the hospital, according to the BBC. Another 1200 guards were pulled from Olympic sites by midweek and were being held in their rooms while getting tested for the virus, the Associated Press reported. Event organizers had to bring in 900 members of the military as replacements.

By [Thu 8 Feb 2018], a day before the opening games, the disease was still spreading, with the official tally of confirmed cases rising to 128. People with the virus typically have uncontrollable bouts of vomiting and diarrhea. This clears the body of norovirus quickly -- usually within one to 3 days. But it also helps spread the bug to others. And one person infected can mean many more falling ill.

To be more precise, we can look to a number called the "R nought," or R0. Most simply, the figure refers to how many other people one sick person is likely to infect on average in a group that's susceptible to the disease. With every disease outbreak, researchers try to figure out how far -- and how fast -- a virus is likely to spread through a population, and they use the R0 to do that. The higher the number, the greater likelihood a lot of people will fall sick.

As you can see [on the figure at the source URL above], norovirus is more contagious than seasonal flu or even Ebola -- and 1 person with norovirus infection can sicken up to 3.7 others.

One caveat when talking about the R0: It's never final. The number can change with every outbreak, and even the R0 for individual viruses can vary wildly depending on the context. As infectious diseases epidemiologist David Fisman has told me, the factors that go into determining the R0 include how many contacts a sick person is likely to make, the number of transmissions that are possible per contact, and how long those people shed the virus and potentially infect others.

"Any one of these factors is going to be influenced by social norms, how people interact, how much infrastructure -- like sewage treatment or clean water -- is available in a place, and how cases are managed," Fisman said. The number is also influenced by population density, vaccination levels, and access to treatments.

For norovirus, the R0 will vary depending on whether the outbreak is contained in one place (like a hospital or cruise ship) or spread more widely. In Olympic venues, where lots of people are in close contact and sharing food, there's a significant risk of spread.

Organizers are working to figure out the source of the problem -- ramping up hygiene inspections and passing around hand sanitizer like it's Olympic swag. So far, no athletes have fallen ill. And Team USA has already reported it's taking extra precautions, like hand washing. The team members will also be staying at a special compound, and not Olympic Village, with their own cooks and food. Hopefully the dreaded norovirus will be gone before the games begin.

[This viral outbreak is serious as any athlete who becomes infected and sick will not be in any shape to compete in the Olympics. One can imagine that this risky situation must be adding to the stress of competition, but they can take precautions by washing their hands often with soap and water. Fortunately, no athlete has yet reported illness. But it is unfortunate for it to have happened in this venue, and for anyone to become sick.

Norovirus infection is caused by nonenveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses of the genus _Norovirus_, also known as "Norwalk-like viruses".
It is a cause of viral gastroenteritis. Transmission occurs primarily through the fecal-oral route, either through direct person-to-person contact or indirectly via contaminated food or water. Norovirus is also spread through aerosols of vomitus and contaminated environmental surfaces and objects.

Norovirus infections are common throughout the world, and globally most children will have experienced one or more infections by the age of 5 years. Infections can occur year round, but in temperate climates, virus activity peaks during the winter. Noroviruses are common in both developing and developed countries.

Norovirus outbreaks frequently occur in settings where people live in close quarters [as is the case at the Olympics] and can easily infect each other, such as hotels, cruise ships, camps, dormitories, and hospitals. Viral contamination of inanimate objects or environmental surfaces (fomites) may persist during and after outbreaks and be a source of infection.

Infected people usually have an acute onset of vomiting with non-bloody diarrhea. The incubation period is 12-48 hours. Other symptoms include abdominal cramps, nausea, and sometimes a low-grade fever. Illness is generally self-limited, and full recovery can be expected in 1-3 days for most patients. In some cases, dehydration, especially in patients who are very young or elderly, may require medical attention. Supportive care is the mainstay of treatment of norovirus disease, especially oral or intravenous rehydration. Antimotility agents should be avoided in children younger than 3 years but may be a useful adjunct to rehydration in older children and adults. Antiemetic agents should generally be reserved for adults. Antibiotics are not useful in treating patients with norovirus disease.

No vaccine is currently available, although vaccine development efforts are advancing. Noroviruses are common and highly contagious, but the risk for infection can be minimized by frequent and proper handwashing and avoiding possibly contaminated food and water. Washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds is considered the most effective way to reduce norovirus contamination; alcohol-based hand sanitizers might be useful between handwashings but should not be considered a substitute for soap and water.
