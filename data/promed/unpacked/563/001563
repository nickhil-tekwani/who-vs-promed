[Professor Lipkin has requested that the 2nd paragraph of the Reuters
news agency report pasted as "Avian influenza, human (132):
transplacental transmission 20070928.3212" be replaced with the
following correction. - Mod.CP]
"The work helps us to understand H5N1's high fatality rate, as well
as serving as model for global collaboration in the field of emerging
infectious diseases," said Dr. Ian Lipkin of Columbia University in
New York, who collaborated in the study. A team at Peking University
in Beijing studied tissue taken from 2 people killed by H5N1 in China
-- a 24-year-old pregnant woman and a 35-year-old man."

Summary
-------
Background
----------
Human infection with avian influenza H5N1 is an emerging infectious
disease characterised by respiratory symptoms and a high fatality
rate. Previous studies have shown that the human infection with avian
influenza H5N1 could also target organs apart from the lungs.
Methods
-------
We studied post-mortem tissues of 2 adults (one man and one pregnant
woman) infected with H5N1 influenza virus, and a fetus carried by the
woman. In-situ hybridisation (with sense and antisense probes to
haemagglutinin and nucleoprotein) and immunohistochemistry (with
monoclonal antibodies to haemagglutinin and nucleoprotein) were done
on selected tissues. Reverse-transcriptase (RT) PCR (polymerase chain
reaction), real-time RT-PCR, strand-specific RT-PCR, and nucleic acid
sequence-based amplification (NASBA) detection assays were also
undertaken to detect viral RNA in organ tissue samples.
Findings
--------
We detected viral genomic sequences and antigens in type II
epithelial cells of the lungs, ciliated and non-ciliated epithelial
cells of the trachea, T cells of the lymph node, neurons of the
brain, and Hofbauer cells and cytotrophoblasts of the placenta. Viral
genomic sequences (but no viral antigens) were detected in the
intestinal mucosa. In the fetus, we found viral sequences and
antigens in the lungs, circulating mononuclear cells, and macrophages
of the liver. The presence of viral sequences in the organs and the
fetus was also confirmed by RT-PCR, strand-specific RT-PCR, real-time
RT-PCR, and NASBA.
Interpretation
--------------
In addition to the lungs, H5N1 influenza virus infects the trachea
and disseminates to other organs including the brain. The virus could
also be transmitted from mother to fetus across the placenta.
