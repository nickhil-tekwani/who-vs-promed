True Taste, LLC of Kenosha, Wisconsin, is recalling vacuum packaged Hot Smoked Rainbow Trout, Hot Smoked Whitefish, Hot Smoked Herring, Hot Smoked Mackerel, Hot Smoked Salmon Steak, Cold Smoked Mackerel, and Cold Smoked Whitefish because they have the potential to be contaminated with _Clostridium botulinum_, a bacterium which can cause life-threatening illness or death. Consumers are warned not to use the product even if it does not look or smell spoiled.

Botulism, a potentially fatal form of food poisoning, can cause the following symptoms: general weakness, dizziness, double-vision, and trouble with speaking or swallowing. Difficulty in breathing, weakness of other muscles, abdominal distension and constipation may also be common symptoms. People experiencing these problems should seek immediate medical attention.

The recalled product is vacuum packaged and can be identified with either the True Taste Label in California and Illinois or the Lowell Foods Label in Illinois. The recalled product has a white sticker applied to the package with 2 sets of numbers. The 1st set of numbers represents the date of processing and the 2nd set of numbers represents the "best if used by" date. This recall includes all production dates beginning on 1 Jan 2012 through current.

No illnesses have been reported to date in connection with this recall.

The potential for contamination was identified after routine samples collected by the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection found that the product did not meet the 3.5 per cent minimum requirement for water phase salt. The sample analysis reported water phase salt concentrations of 2.2 per cent (hot smoked white fish); 3.0 per cent (hot smoked herring); and 3.4 per cent (hot smoked rainbow trout).

Consumers that may still have packages of the recalled smoked fish in their homes should not consume the product and are urged to return them to the place of purchase for a full refund.

True Taste LLC has voluntarily halted production and is cooperating fully with the involved regulatory authorities. This recall is being conducted with the knowledge of the FDA.

[Images of the labels of these products can be found at http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm332786.htm. It is not entirely clear from this posting if the distribution of the products is limited to Illinois and California.

Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most of the food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures, which could, but not necessarily do, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_. - Mod.LL
