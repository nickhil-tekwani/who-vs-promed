In response to this posting on human to animal transmission of
_Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ [Tuberculosis - South Africa: human to animal
transmission 20080827.2680] I would like to add some clarifying comments.

It is a well known and documented fact that human tuberculosis can be
transmitted to domestic animals including pets wherever they live in close
contact. The isolation rate of _M. tuberculosis_ from slaughter pigs with
lymphadenitis in South Africa, especially during the 2nd half of the
previous century, was witness to the increasing infection rate in the human
population.

Wild animals in captivity can also contract the infection from humans and
cases have been reported internationally, especially from zoological
gardens including in Pretoria, South Africa (Michel, et al. J Zoo and Wildl
Med 2003; 34: 364-70), where it is no new finding at all. The infection was
diagnosed in isolated springbok in 1999 and in the meantime in several more
sporadic cases in different game species.

Game farming and other forms of closer association between humans and wild
animals are the most probable causes. The reference to mongooses must be
corrected as it did not occur in South Africa but in Botswana (Alexander,
et al. Emerg Infect Dis 2002; 8: 598-601).

All in all it should be emphasised that infected humans present a source of
infection to domestic and wild animals in their care but the risk for
humans contracting human tuberculosis (TB) from animals is probably
negligible when compared to human-to-human transmission. The infection is
not only so much rarer in animals than in humans (_M. tb_ accounts for 80
per cent of all notifiable human infections) but unlike in humans, where
coughing is the primary vehicle for transmission, respiratory symptoms were
generally not observed in infected animals.
