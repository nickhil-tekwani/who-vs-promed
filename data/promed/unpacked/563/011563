DYSAUTONOMIA IN DOMESTIC DOGS - MISSOURI, USA

Fatal Disease Strikes Dogs in Midwest (USA)
For the first time, researchers have confirmed cases of canine dysautonomia
in the US. This disorder, which destroys an
animal's autonomic nervous system, appeared in 11 dogs, nine of which lived
within a 50-mile radius of Springfield, Mo.
All 11 animals died or were euthanized because of the severity of the
illness. Randall C. Longshore of the Missouri-Columbia College of Veterinary
Internal Medicine reports that an infectious or neurotoxic agent may cause
the dysautonomia. It is doubted that the disease is contagious.
Animals with this illness have an unusually low density of certain nerves in
the autonomic nervous system. They suffer from an array of symptoms which
include emaciation, vomiting, difficulty urinating, and dry mucous membranes.
Since the first reported cases of canine dysautonomia in England in
1983, vets have diagnosed nine others throughout Europe. The first US case
of this disorder was reported in 1981 but researchers never confirmed it.
This disease can show up occasionally in people, cats, horses, and wild
European hares.
The Missouri group's research on the 11 dogs represents the first in-depth
study of canine dysautonomia. Whether the disease is actually striking more
dogs in the US or is simply being diagnosed more often remains unclear. At
present there is no treatment.
