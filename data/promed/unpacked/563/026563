The Wuhan Municipal Commission of Health reported new coronavirus infections at 4:20 on 22 Jan 2020, with 60 new cases, 2 deaths, and no discharge cases.

The city continued to increase collection and testing of samples and immediately collected patient samples from hospitals and sent them to the Provincial Center for Disease Control for new coronavirus detection. The expert group made comprehensive investigations based on clinical manifestations, epidemiological history, and pathogenic test results and confirmed 60 cases of pneumonia as coronavirus infections.

Of the 60 patients, 33 were male and 27 were female; the youngest was 15 years old, and the oldest was 88 years old; the onset dates were before [18 Jan 2020]; the 1st symptoms were mostly fever, cough or chest tightness, and dyspnea. Among the patients, 17 were seriously ill, and 3 were critically ill. Epidemiological investigations of new cases are underway, and close contacts are being tracked.

The deceased, a 66-year-old male, was admitted to the hospital for "intermittent cough, headache, fatigue, and fever for 6 days" on [16 Jan 2020]; dyspnea [shortness of breath] occurred on [17 Jan 2020], and multiple organ involvement appeared at 10:35 on [20 Jan 2020] followed by functional failure and death. The deceased had basic diseases such as COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease], hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and chronic renal insufficiency.

The 2nd deceased case, a 48-year-old female, became ill on [10 Dec 2019], developed dyspnea on [27 Dec 2020], and was transferred to Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital for treatment on [31 Dec 2020]. She had severe respiratory distress upon admission, [20 Jan 2020]. At 14:31, multiple organ failure occurred, and the patient died. The deceased had basic diseases such as diabetes, cerebral infarction, and gallstones during her lifetime.

As of 24:00 on [20 Jan 2020], 258 cases of pneumonia of new coronavirus infection have been reported in our city; 25 cases have been cured, and 6 cases have died. Currently, 227 patients are still being treated in the hospital, of which 51 cases are seriously ill and 12 cases are critically ill. They are all under isolation treatment at designated medical institutions in Wuhan. A total of 988 close contacts have been tracked; 739 have been released from medical observation, and 249 are still under medical observation.

We will continue to conduct timely sampling and detection of newly discovered suspected cases.

[3] Query re: mortality rates
Date: Tue 21 Jan 2020
From: Monir Taha <monir.taha@ottawa.ca> [edited]


It might be useful to try to estimate the death rate of 2019-nCoV and compare it to that of influenza.

The US CDC provides estimates of the disease burden of influenza at https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html. Estimated mortality per 1000 illnesses between 2010-2011 and 2018-2019 ranged from approximately 1 to 1.7 deaths per 1000 illnesses.

If there are currently 6 deaths out of 258 confirmed cases in Wuhan due to 2019-nCoV (a rate of 23 deaths per 1000 confirmed cases, see https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/death-toll-coronavirus-outbreak-china-6-1.5434256), the question is what would the death rate be with a denominator of illnesses rather than confirmed cases? One can see that it would take only 13 or 14 illnesses per confirmed case to make the 2019-nCoV death rate similar to the influenza death rate of 1.7 per 1000 illnesses.

Since it is reasonably possible that for every confirmed case of 2019-nCoV there are at least 10 undetected illnesses (a seroprevalence study would help answer this question), then one could speculate that 2019-nCoV is more similar in severity to influenza than it is to SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. Its transmissibility seems to lie between these 2 groups.

Such an estimation could be helpful to adjust response activities proportionate to disease severity and transmissibility.

[Dr Taha raises some interesting points. In the absence of serologic testing at present, it is not possible to determine a baseline attack rate in the community, so we are left to using confirmed cases, most of whom do not have milder presentations. Currently, there are 51 out of 227 (22.5 percent) with very serious clinical presentation, and 12 (5.3 percent) are critically ill. Right now, it is just 4-6 weeks into this outbreak, and with many more questions than answers. - Mod.MPP]

1st US case of potentially deadly Chinese coronavirus confirmed in Washington state
----------------------------------
A Washington state man has been diagnosed with the mysterious virus that broke out last month [December 2019] in China, becoming the 1st confirmed case in the United States of an illness that has killed at least 6 people and sickened hundreds more, according to US officials.

The man, in his 30s, is in stable condition at Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett, Washington. Officials said they are monitoring him there out of an abundance of caution, not because he is seriously ill. The man returned to the United States last week [week of 13 Jan 2020] before federal health officials began screening travelers from the central Chinese city of Wuhan at Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York's John F Kennedy international airports, the 1st such effort since the 2014 Ebola outbreak.

Washington state health officials said the man, a resident of Snohomish County, Wash., returned [Wed 15 Jan 2020] from a trip to the region where he was visiting relatives in Wuhan, where the outbreak began. Shortly after arriving at Seattle's international airport, he began feeling ill and reached out to his health-care provider on [Sun 19 Jan 2020]. Local, state and federal officials quickly collected samples and sent them to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for testing. His case was confirmed [Mon 20 Jan 2020] as the coronavirus that has sickened close to 300 people in China and others in Thailand, Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea.

CDC officials said [Tue 21 Jan 2020] that they are expanding screening to international airports in Atlanta and Chicago. More than 1200 travelers have already been screened since [Fri 17 Jan 2020], with no one yet referred to a hospital or discovered to be ill with the virus. Federal officials will also direct travelers arriving in the United States on direct and indirect flights from Wuhan to those 5 airports for screening. That process is getting worked out in the coming days. For example, if a passenger was originally scheduled to fly from Wuhan to Shanghai and then Boston, that flight would most likely be rerouted to JFK for screening, and then Boston, CDC officials said. Screenings are being conducted in Chinese and Mandarin.

What we know about the coronavirus spreading in China and elsewhere
The Washington state man's case originated several days before airport screening began, but local, state and federal officials said they were on alert and quickly collaborated to test him and put precautions in place. A small number of health-care workers and patients who may have been exposed to him have been told to watch for symptoms and are being monitored, Washington state health officials said. Officials are tracing the people he may have come into contact with in both China and the United States.

Officials praised the man for taking the initiative to reach out to his health-care provider. "He was a very astute gentleman," said Scott Lindquist, Washington state's epidemiologist. "He was looking at the Internet actively" and saw information about the virus and its spread, Lindquist said in a news briefing on [Tue 21 Jan 2020].

Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease, said the risk posed by the virus to the general American population is low but that older adults with underlying health conditions may be at increased risk. She said federal officials are prepared to respond quickly. "This is an evolving situation and, again, we do expect additional cases in the United States and globally," she said.

The CDC and officials from homeland security and transportation agencies are working out how future travelers arriving in the United States from Wuhan will be redirected to the 5 airports. US officials want to make sure every time someone books a flight from Wuhan to the United States, their 1st point of entry is one of those airports, said Martin Cetron, director of the CDC's division of global migration and quarantine. Only JFK and San Francisco airports have direct flights. The process is complex and will involve "reissuing tickets and redirecting passengers all over the globe," Cetron said. In addition to the expanding airport screening, the CDC has raised its travel alert notice from level 1 to level 2, urging travelers to Wuhan to avoid contact with sick people, animals (alive or dead) and animal markets.

The outbreak has grown rapidly in recent days, with authorities in China reporting confirmed cases in multiple cities as hundreds of millions of people in China and elsewhere in Asia are on the move in the run-up to the Lunar New Year, the biggest travel event in the world. The infection is believed to have begun among people who shopped or worked at an animal market in Wuhan. But its rapid spread led officials to conclude that people, as well as animals, could transmit the infection.

The Washington state man did not visit that market and did not know anyone who was ill, Washington state officials said. The source of the man's infection raises more questions and concerns about human-to-human transmission of the disease. Chinese officials have confirmed that phenomenon is taking place.

To control this outbreak, health officials are trying to determine whether new cases being reported in other cities in China and elsewhere can be traced back to Wuhan, said Tom Inglesby, director of the Center for Health Security at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. If the disease has been circulating independently in other parts of the country, that information would affect not only how China contains it, but also how other public health agencies in the world seek to prevent its spread, he said.

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses ranging from the common cold to much more serious diseases and can infect both humans and animals, according to the World Health Organization. The strain spreading in China is related to 2 other coronaviruses that have caused major outbreaks in recent years: Middle East respiratory syndrome, also known as MERS, and severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS.
"Since this is a respiratory virus, it is spread easier than Ebola, so it brings with it more fear of easily being transmitted between people," said Matthew Frieman, a virologist and associated professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine who studies coronaviruses.

The WHO is meeting Wednesday [22 Jan 2020] to decide whether to declare the outbreak a public health emergency.

Symptoms of a coronavirus infection include respiratory problems, difficulty breathing, fever and cough, and can lead to severe cases of pneumonia, kidney failure, acute respiratory syndrome (when fluid builds up in the lungs) and death. The elderly, young and those with an already weakened immune system are at a higher risk of developing severe lower respiratory tract diseases, such as bronchitis and pneumonia, according to the CDC.

What you need to know about coronavirus
What is coronavirus and how does it spread? Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses ranging from the common cold to much more serious diseases, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, which can infect both humans and animals, according to the World Health Organization. China has confirmed that the new strain is being transmitted between humans. Here's what we know so far about the virus.

The US, along with Thailand, Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea have all confirmed cases of the infection, which began last month [December 2019] in central China.

In China, health authorities imposed a quasi-quarantine on Wuhan, home to 11 million people. They did so in part because the upcoming Lunar New Year is a time when people often travel to their home towns. Chinese authorities are also screening passengers at airports for coronavirus symptoms. Other airports in Asia are doing the same.

US Health officials are screening travelers arriving from Wuhan to Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York's JFK. They will soon be screening travelers arriving from Wuhan at Chicago O'Hare and Atlanta international airports. And in the coming days, all flights from Wuhan to the United States will be redirected so their first port of entry is one of those five airports.

[It was only a matter of time before the USA would identify a case of the 2019-nCoV infection. There is significant traffic between China and the USA and with the increase in numbers of cases, it was likely to happen. Fortunately, this individual was responsible and presented himself to the medical sector when he developed symptoms.

https://www.cdc.gov.tw/Bulletin/Detail/6oHuoqzW9e_onW0AaMEemg?typeid=9


[Taiwan medical personnel] boarded the plane immediately to find the 1st severe and special infectious pneumonia case transferred from Wuhan, Mainland China. The command center raised the tourist epidemic situation in Wuhan, Mainland China to the 3rd level warning (Warning)

The Central Epidemic Outbreak Command Center announced today [21 Jan 2020] the 1st case of severe pneumonia in an individual returning from abroad. It was a female in her 50s living in the south. She worked in Wuhan, Mainland China. She flew in from Wuhan yesterday [20 Jan 2020], due to fever and cough. Shortness of breath and other symptoms were identified by the airport quarantine staff and she was sent for medical treatment. X-ray examination showed pneumonia. Today's laboratory examinations confirmed that it was positive for new coronavirus and she continued to be treated in the negative pressure isolation ward of the hospital. Since the case was immediately sent to the hospital isolation ward for treatment after getting off the plane and did not enter the community, please do not panic.

The command center stated that hospitals and local health units have followed the procedures for reporting cases of severe special infectious pneumonia for reporting, inspection, quarantine treatment, epidemic investigation, and tracking of 46 contacts on flights. The suspected cases must be laboratory confirmed the quarantine can only be lifted after both tests are negative. In response to the 1st confirmed case in Taiwan, the command center has simultaneously notified the World Health Organization and the IHR focal point.

Due to the rapid increase of cases in Wuhan, infectious disease experts in mainland China have advised the public not to go to the local area as much as possible; the World Health Organization also said today that the new type of coronavirus may have continuous human-to-human transmission capacity in [2020] and that the 1st case confirmed by the Taiwan Command Center had returned from Wuhan to Taiwan for medical treatment. In case of immigration, the command center announced from now on the recommendation to raise the tourist epidemic situation in Wuhan, Mainland China to the 3rd level warning, reminding the public to avoid going to the local area unless necessary.

The pneumonia epidemic caused by the new type of coronavirus infection in mainland China has apparently spread in the community and the situation has expanded. The command center continues to coordinate the integration of resources and manpower of various ministries, strengthen quarantine measures at international airports, small 3-way ports, and public communication and health education. And ensure the preparation of anti-epidemic materials to prevent the supply of false information related to supply shortages or upsurges, reduce public panic, and pre-plan and exercise for the infection control of medical institutions to reduce the impact of the epidemic on the country and fully protect the domestic epidemic prevention security, to ensure the health of the people.

The command center once again urged people to implement personal hygiene measures such as washing hands with soap, wearing cough masks, etc., to avoid contact with wild animals and patients with acute respiratory infections, as well as access to traditional markets and hospitals. If you have fever, cough, or other discomfort when returning to China, you should take the initiative to notify the airport and port quarantine personnel; if you have the above-mentioned suspected symptoms within 14 days of returning to China, you can call the toll-free epidemic prevention line 1922 (or 0800-001922) and wear it according to instructions As soon as the mask comes to the doctor, please inform the doctor of your travel history, occupation, contact history, and whether it is clustered (TOCC), and timely diagnosis notification. For more information on "Severe Special Infectious Pneumonia", please refer to the website of the Department of Health (https://www.cdc.gov.tw).

On [20 Jan 2020], the National IHR Focal Point (NFP) for the Republic of Korea reported the 1st case of novel coronavirus in the Republic of Korea. The case is a 35-year-old female, Chinese national, residing in Wuhan, Hubei province in China.

The case-patient had developed fever, chills, and muscle pain on [18 Jan 2020] while in Wuhan. She visited a local hospital in Wuhan and was initially diagnosed with a cold. On [19 Jan 2020], the case-patient was detected with fever (38.3 C [100 F]) upon arrival at the Incheon International Airport. The case-patient was transferred to a national designated isolation hospital for testing and treatment. She was tested positive for pancoronavirus reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, and subsequently was confirmed positive for novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) on [20 Jan 2020] by sequencing at the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). Upon detection, the patient had chills, runny nose, and muscle pain.

The case-patient did not report visiting any markets, including Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, nor did she have known contact with confirmed 2019-nCoV cases or wild animals in Wuhan city.

The case-patient is currently under isolation receiving treatment and is in a stable condition.

Public health response
- Contact tracing and other epidemiological investigations are underway;
- The government of the Republic of Korea has scaled up the national alert level from Blue (Level 1) to Yellow (Level 2 out of 4-level national crisis management system);
- The Republic of Korea health authority has strengthened surveillance for pneumonia cases in health facilities nationwide since 3 Jan 2020;
- Quarantine and screening measures have been enhanced for travelers from Wuhan at the point of entries (PoE) since 3 Jan 2020;
- Public risk communication has been enhanced.

WHO risk assessment
This is the 4th internationally exported case of 2019-nCoV from Wuhan City, China by travelers. Since the initial report of cases on [31 Dec 2019], and as of [20 Jan 2020], 278 laboratory-confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infection including 6 deaths were reported to WHO globally from China, 2 cases from Thailand, 1 case from Japan, and 1 case from the Republic of Korea. In China, 51 are severe cases, and 12 cases are critically ill. They are all under isolation treatment at designated medical institutions in Wuhan. Among the cases reported in China, 14 cases have been reported from Guangdong province, 5 from Beijing municipality and 1 from Shanghai municipality.

The source of the outbreak is still under investigation in Wuhan City. Preliminary investigations have identified environmental samples positive for nCoV in Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan City; however, some laboratory-confirmed patients did not report visiting this market. Cases continue to be reported from Wuhan City and from other provinces in China. Additional investigations are needed to determine how the patients were infected, the extent of human-to-human transmission, the clinical spectrum of disease, and the geographic range of infection.

WHO advice
It is prudent to remind populations and health workers of the basic principles to reduce the general risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections by following the following measures:
- Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections;
- Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment;
- Avoiding unprotected contact with farm or wild animals;
- People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands);
- Within healthcare facilities, enhance standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, especially in emergency departments.
- WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travelers. In case of symptoms suggestive of acute respiratory illness either during or after travel, the travelers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share their travel history with their health care provider. Health authorities should work with travel, transport and tourism sectors to provide travelers with information to reduce the general risk of acute respiratory infections via travel health clinics, travel agencies, conveyance operators, and at points of entry.

WHO has provided interim guidance for novel coronaviruses.
WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions on Korea based on the information currently available on this event.

[As a reminder, South Korea had a major outbreak of MERS-CoV disease in 2015 when a businessman returned from the Arabian Peninsula, and in addition to being a superspreader index case, also sought medical attention in more than one hospital. This practice was common in those days and the outbreak included hospital-to-hospital transmission of the MERS-CoV. Hospital infection control practices were revised following the outbreak (186 cases including 38 deaths). Hence, the South Korean CDC has revised policies and has a high index of suspicion for identifying suspected cases of a novel coronavirus infection.
