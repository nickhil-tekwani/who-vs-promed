USA: Norovirus outbreaks in care facilities across New York state
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The virus responsible for sickening cruise ship passengers appears to have
made its way to the Southern Tier. A Steuben County nursing home and health
care facilities across [New York] state are reporting cases of norovirus
infection, which causes vomiting and diarrhea. It was reported also at the
Waters of Three Rivers nursing home in Gang Mills. The number of cases was
not disclosed.
State and local health officials say they suspect the virus is widespread.
"We're sure it's around, but there's not a routine test for it," said
Melissa Klossner, Chemung County's clinical coordinator of public health.
"People show up at their doctor's with the symptoms and they are done with
it within 24 to 48 hours." Norovirus infections are only reported when the
infected person is admitted to a hospital or is living in a nursing home.
Any sense of how widespread the virus is in the general community is
strictly anecdotal, Klossner said.
The virus was first identified in 1972 after an outbreak of
gastrointestinal illness in Norwalk, Ohio. Other viruses causing similar
symptoms -- nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, low-grade fever,
and headaches -- have been designated as Norwalk-like viruses. [These
viruses have been grouped together now in the genus _Norovirus_ and
consequently are now referred to as "noroviruses". - Mod.CP] The virus,
spread person to person, is contagious. Those in communal living
situations, such as nursing homes or hospitals, are vulnerable, health
officials said.
The Gang Mills cases, reported on Mon 6 Jan 2003, and others across the
state have prompted the state Health Department to issue alerts to all
hospitals, public health agencies and adult homes in New York. "We're
seeing it all over the state, which is a typical pattern for this time of
year," said state Health Department spokeswoman Kristine Smith. "As of Mon
6 Jan 2003, we have received reports of cases in 39 long-term care
facilities, including 12 in western New York. We also have reports of cases
in one hospital in the Capitol (Albany) region. "Most of reported cases
wouldn't be known because it's generally an illness you don't see a doctor
for. But when the symptoms occur in a health care facility, they have to be
reported to a state health department by law," Smith said.
According to the US Food and Drug Administration, only the common cold is
reported more frequently than gastrointestinal illnesses such as norovirus
infection. It is also estimated that noroviruses are responsible for about
a third (181 000) of all gastrointestinal viral infections occurring in the
United States each year.

Canada: more rail passengers with symptoms of norovirus infection
-----------------------------------------------------------------
3 more people who were on the Via Rail train that stopped in Winnipeg on
Tue 7 Jan 2003 after fears it was contaminated with norovirus have fallen
ill. Via Rail confirms that 3 more people who are now in Ontario have
become sick. When the train arrived in Vancouver last weekend, 26 people
were sick with symptoms similar to norovirus infection.
Via employees' union says some workers have also experienced symptoms.
Union spokesman Brad Roy says the illness outbreak may have originated in
the smoking car, often the most crowded on the train.
The train was delayed in Winnipeg for 6 hours on Tuesday while health
officials inspected it. They let the train continue after giving it a clean
bill of health. Transport Canada is investigating, but it will not have any
answers for at least another week.

Canada: current and previous suspected norovirus outbreaks on Via Rail trains
------------------------------------------------
Via Rail said yesterday 3 more people who are now in Ontario are affected
by suspected norovirus infection. 26 passengers were reported ill when the
train arrived in Vancouver from the east last weekend. "The train should
never have left Vancouver," said Brad Roy, health and safety officer for
CAW Local 4002 in Winnipeg. Via Rail officials said they exchanged 9 cars
for new ones in Vancouver and completely sanitized the 2 remaining cars
before the train left the west coast. Just before the train pulled into
Winnipeg Tuesday, one passenger reported feeling ill. The Toronto-bound
train was held up for 6 hours in Winnipeg when some Via staff members
refused to board the train because they feared the train was infected with
norovirus.
Federal health and transport officials met and agreed the train was safe
and it pulled out of the Main Street station Tuesday evening with a full
crew. By the time it arrived in Toronto yesterday, 3 more cases were
reported. The scrub-down of the train in Vancouver obviously wasn't enough
to stop its spread, said Roy, who has worked on an in-house committee
looking at ways of dealing with such outbreaks. He said the vomiting and
diarrhea recently attacked a handful of staff and passengers on the Via
Rail train that runs from Winnipeg to Churchill. Via spokesmen were not
available to confirm that yesterday.
It wouldn't be the first time [norovirus infection] has made life miserable
for Via, said Roy, a senior service attendant with Via. "The first outbreak
was in July 2002," he said. Last summer, up to 17 passengers were affected
by a suspected norovirus outbreak on board a Via Rail train that left
Jasper for Toronto on 5 Jul 2002. Those passengers in turn infected as many
as 100 people they came in contact with after leaving the train, Health
Canada said. Later that month, a similar outbreak affected between 5 and 10
passengers on a Via Rail train that left Toronto for Vancouver on 16 Jul
2002. At the time, federal health officials said the source was not on the
train, but likely brought aboard by an infected passenger. The virus can be
passed from any object touched by an infected person. Epidemiologists have
said it can also be passed when a person vomits in an enclosed area, and
people inhale the air within that area.
Via Rail has said in the past that it's doing everything it can to prevent
the spread of the illness on its trains, but the virus is turning up
everywhere -- not just in Via Rail cars. Norovirus outbreaks have swept
through North America this winter, spreading misery on cruise ships in the
US and forcing Manitoba hospitals to close infected wards.

Canada: suspected norovirus outbreak at seniors complex in Winnipeg
-------------------------------------------------------
A possible outbreak of norovirus infection affected a Winnipeg seniors
complex in Winnipeg last week. Between 15 and 20 residents on a community
living ward at the core-area seniors center suddenly fell ill last
Thursday. A couple of staff members also got sick. Although it wasn't
confirmed as a gastrointestinal outbreak, Devlin said symptoms were similar
to those associated with norovirus infection.
According to Manitoba Health, the province has experienced 46
gastrointestinal outbreaks since 1 November 2002 -- including 29 in
personal care homes and 4 in elderly housing complexes. 10 hospitals and
one school also reported possible cases of the virus.
Workers at Lions Centre restricted contact between residents, and staff
increased housekeeping and disinfecting procedures and "washed their hands
lots," Devlin said. Residents and staff have since returned to good health.

Latvia: viral gastroenteritis outbreak in military recruits
-----------------------------------------------------------
72 recruits from the Aluksne Mobile Riflemen Battalion contracted an
intestinal infection yesterday and this morning, and it could possibly be
[caused by] rotavirus. As Uldis Davidovs, the head of the Armed Forces'
Press and Information Department, told LETA, specialists from Military
Medical Center, Disaster Medical Relief Center, and the Public Health
Agency have already departed for Aluksne. [Rotavirus-associated illness is
commoner in younger age groups and this presumptive diagnosis requires
confirmation. - Mod.CP]
Janis Micans, the head of the Military Medical Center, told LETA that the
condition of the conscripts is not serious and local medics may possibly be
able to cope with the situation. The press secretary at the Public Health
Agency, Ieva Lasmane, could not confirm to LETA for the time being whether
there are any cases of infection among civilians.

Latvia: gastroenteritis outbreak attributed to faulty water supply
------------------------------------------------------------------
No new cases of an intestinal ailment have been registered today in the
Aluksne Mobile Riflemen Battalion [see above report], where 102 recruits
have been stricken. Nineteen required hospital treatment.
Public Health Agency Press Secretary Ieva Lasmane told LETA that her office
believes that the outbreak of the infection within the ranks could have
been the result of an accident in the water pipeline on Fri 3 Jan 2003. The
first soldiers were stricken on the evening of Thu 9 Jan 2003. [These
circumstances increase the number of potential etiologic agents. - Mod.CP]

USA: suspected norovirus outbreak at high school in Texas
---------------------------------------------------------
More than 700 students at Cypress Creek High School were absent or sent
home on Friday in what may be an outbreak of norovirus infection, the
illness notorious for plaguing passengers aboard cruise ships.
"It does appear to be an outbreak of norovirus infection," said Rita Obey,
a spokeswoman with the Harris County Public Health Department, which is
investigating the rash of cases. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea struck
large numbers of students suddenly, a hallmark of norovirus infection.
Officials in the Cypress-Fairbanks Independent School District in north
west Harris County said 400 of the school's 3200 students were absent on
Thu 9 Jan 2003. By Friday, 646 were absent and 82 more sent home during the
day. The school district canceled Friday night activities at the high
school, but did not call off Monday classes.
More students may fall ill next week because outbreaks tend to occur in
waves, experts warned. "You have several cases and it looks like it goes
away -- then you have several (more) cases," said Kathy Barton, spokeswoman
for Houston Department of Health and Human Services. "We see it a lot,
especially in contained areas such as cruise ships, nursing homes, schools,
areas where you have a captive audience." Washing your hands, covering your
mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze, and not sharing food or drinks are
ways to prevent transmission, Barton said. So far, other area schools
appear free of the virus, Harris County health officials said. County
epidemiologists are looking at possible sources for the outbreak, which is
spread through food, water, or close personal contact.
The noroviruses are among many common microorganisms that can cause
intestinal diseases, according to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. Norovirus has become a household name in recent months,
sickening more than 1000 passengers and crew members on ships bound for
Hawaii, Alaska, and the Caribbean.

USA: person to person spread fuelled Texas school outbreak
----------------------------------------------------------
A viral outbreak contributing to more than 700 student absences on Fri 10
2003 (see [7] above) at Cypress Creek High School was spread from person to
person, not through contaminated food or water, school district officials
said on Mon 13 Jan 2003. More than 300 students were absent on Monday from
the 3200 student school in north west Harris County, but officials with
Cypress Fairbanks Independent School District did not know how many of
those were due to the virus infection. The virus, which causes nausea,
vomiting, and diarrhea for 24 to 48 hours, is making its way through
elementary and middle schools that feed into Cypress Creek High School,
district officials said. Those schools have slightly higher-than-usual
student absences, said district spokeswoman Kelli Durham, because the
illness is spreading to younger siblings of infected high school students.
Durham said the schools reported sending vomiting children home on Monday
but did not know how many were ill.
The Harris County health department, which is investigating the outbreak,
said the culprit appears to be a norovirus. [Diagnosis of norovirus
infection is confirmed usually by electron microscopy] of a stool sample.
There is no specific treatment except for comfort measures for symptoms.
Proper handwashing and not sharing food or drinks can prevent transmission.
Rita Obey, a spokeswoman for Harris County Public Health and Environmental
Services, said the timing of the outbreak coincided neatly with students'
return from the winter break. In interviews with students, some said they
began feeling ill before coming to school. The school district cleaned and
sanitized the building over the weekend. Obey said food service areas were
found to be clean.

USA: Metro Detroit area hit by norovirus outbreaks
--------------------------------------------------
A virus grabbing headlines for sickening hundreds of passengers on cruise
ships is hitting Metro Detroit. Emergency room workers at Beaumont
Hospital, Royal Oak were busy over the weekend handling an increase in
norovirus infection cases, Dr Frank McGeorge said. "If I see 20 people in a
day, 4 or 5 might have norovirus infection" he said. "That's twice as bad
as it has ever been." Health officials also are investigating whether 81
people who ate or worked at a Macomb County banquet center just before
Christmas may have contracted the virus, whose symptoms last up to 72
hours. So far, 6 people in that outbreak tested positive for norovirus
infection.
Norovirus gained national attention as hundreds of passengers reported
becoming violently ill while working or vacationing on cruise ships. Since
then, reports of the virus among schoolchildren, nursing-home patients, and
the general population have poured in across the state and the nation. The
US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta predicts
that 23 million people in the United States will contract norovirus
infection this year (about 12.6 per cent of the population). In comparison,
roughly 10 per cent of the US population is expected to contract influenza
virus infection.
There is no commercial norovirus test available to doctors, which compounds
the problem, said Marc-Alain Widdowson, an epidemiologist with CDC. Only
[government laboratories] can test for the virus. But Michigan health
officials do not separate outbreaks by illness unless the federal
government requires the ailment to be tracked. Norovirus infection is not
among those ailments.
Wayne County medical director Donald Lawrenchuk said national studies
suggest that 90 per cent of norovirus cases could be avoided if regular
handwashing was observed.
