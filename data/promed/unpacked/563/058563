Hepatitis C cases may be linked to traveling hospital technician
-----------------------------------------------------
Two patients treated at a Hays, Kansas, hospital in 2010 have tested positive for a strain of hepatitis C "closely related" to a cluster of 30 cases in New Hampshire traced to a traveling hospital technician, health officials said Friday [10 Aug 2012].

Kansas officials notified more than 400 people last month that they may have been exposed to hepatitis C by David Kwiatkowski, who worked at the Hays Medical Center's cardiac catheterization lab from May 24 to Sept. 22, 2010. Kwiatkowski is accused of causing an outbreak at a New Hampshire hospital where he was fired in June [2012]. Authorities believe he stole anesthetic drugs from a hospital lab, injected himself and contaminated syringes later used on patients. He has worked in at least 18 hospitals in eight states and was fired from two. Hepatitis C is a blood-borne viral infection that can cause liver damage and chronic health problems.

The Kansas Department of Health and Environment said that of 334 former Hays Medical patients who submitted blood as of Thursday, 311 were negative for hepatitis C. Tests on others are pending. Only patients who underwent cardiac catheterization procedures while Kwiatkowski worked at Hays were potentially put at risk, the state said. The hospital initially identified 474 such patients, but that included 54 people who died of various causes before the July alerts.

[It is still unclear what procedure or procedures in use in the catheterization laboratories in many different hospitals enabled an itinerant technician apparently to be able to return contaminated syringes to general use. There is still a lack of clarity in the reporting of these incidents. It is relevant also to know precisely the extent of the relationship between the Kansas viruses and the viruses in the New Hampshire cluster.
