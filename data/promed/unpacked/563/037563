The BBC has reported a sharp increase in the number of persons affected
with hemorrhagic disease [Probably referring to hemorrhagic fever with
renal syndrome, caused by Puumala or another hantavirus. - Mod.CHC: 8535
cases and 35 deaths in the past 9 months. About half of the cases have
been in the Republic of Bashkortostan, the remainder in Udmurt Republic,
Republic of Tatarstan, and the regions of Penza, Saratov and Ulyanovsk.
Males account for about 75% of those infected.
Other statistics:
Samara Region - 700 cases and 4 deaths reported over the past 2 months
Zhigulevsk town - 400 hospitalized
Tolyatti town - state of emergency declared
This information is attributed to First Deputy Health Minister Gennadiy
Onishchenko.

[I get a bit dizzy trying to keep up with what is where in the former
Soviet Union. However, the web tells me that all the mentioned locations
are in Russia. Given that hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is
a commonly occurring disease (caused by one or another of the hantaviruses
that occur in Russia), this report could be considered fairly usual, that
is unless we knew whether 8,535 cases in nine months is not usual. That
the report indicates a "sharp increase" gives us a clue but leaves us with
no real data. We already know this is a serious situation but we do not
know the ecologic and political factors combining to cause the situation.
What has been the precipitation in those areas in 1997, as compared with
previous years? Is a successful wheat crop providing food for rodents to
increase their populations? We have the facts in terms of numbers of cases
but we do not have the answers to the epidemiologically-relevant questions:
who?, what?, when?, where?, and, most critically, why?, and how? Without
these there is no hope of prevention.
