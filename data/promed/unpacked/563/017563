[1] USA: delta variant effect on COVID deaths
Date: Thu 22 Jul 2021 18:24 EDT
Source: National Public Radio (NPR) [edited]

The current COVID-19 surge in the USA -- fueled by the highly contagious delta variant -- will steadily accelerate through the summer and fall, peaking in mid-October [2021], with daily deaths more than triple what they are now. That's according to new projections released Wednesday [21 Jul 2021] from the COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub, a consortium of researchers working in consultation with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to help the agency track the course of the pandemic.

It's a deflating prospect for parents looking ahead to the coming school year, employers planning to get people back to the workplace, and everyone hoping the days of big national surges were over.

"What's going on in the country with the virus is matching our most pessimistic scenarios," says Justin Lessler, an epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina who helps run the modeling hub. "We might be seeing synergistic effects of people becoming less cautious in addition to the impacts of the delta variant. I think it's a big call for caution," he adds.

The group's latest projections combine 10 different mathematical models from various academic teams to create an "ensemble" projection. It offers 4 scenarios for its projections -- varying based on what percent of the population gets vaccinated and how quickly the delta variant spreads.

In the most likely scenario, Lessler says, the USA reaches only 70% vaccination among eligible Americans, and the delta variant is 60% more transmissible. In that scenario, at the peak in mid-October [2021], there would be around 60 000 cases and around 850 deaths each day, Lessler says.

Each scenario also includes a range of how bad things could get -- the very worst end of the range for the most likely scenario shows about 240 000 people getting infected and 4000 people dying each day at the October [2021] peak, which would be almost as bad as last winter.

Lessler notes there's a lot of uncertainty in these projections, and how things actually [play] out depends on lots of factors, including whether the vaccination campaign picks up steam, and whether other mitigation measures are put back into place. "Changes in behavior that we didn't predict and big shifts in vaccination could very much change these results," Lessler says.

But overall, the main projection shows a steady slope upwards to the peak in October [2021], and then a steady slope back down. "By the time you get to October, these resurgent epidemics have burned through a lot of the people who are susceptible," Lessler explains.

At that point, "herd immunity starts kicking in a little more aggressively and we start to see things going down again." By January 2022, the model shows deaths coming back down to around the current level of about 300 per day.

The take-home message of this latest model is that the pandemic isn't over yet and "we're not going to be able to land the plane without turbulence," says William Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. "How much turbulence will track with how many people are vaccinated in a given community. I also strongly suspect that delta is highly prone to superspreading -- if I am right, it might go off like a bomb in some under-vaccinated communities," Hanage adds.

Public policy and behavior could still move the dial toward milder outcomes, Lessler says. "I think states should maybe be rethinking the speed at which they're removing mask mandates or social distancing," Lessler says. "That is something that -- if you want to keep cases under control -- certainly would have an impact."

Those measures would have to come from state or local leaders. Despite calls for the CDC to issue new mask guidelines, at a briefing Thursday [22 Jul 2021], CDC director Rochelle Walensky once again held firm. She emphasized that the guidelines have always said that unvaccinated people should wear masks indoors. She added that even vaccinated people could wear masks indoors, too, if they want extra protection, especially in places where the virus is surging and there are a lot of unvaccinated people. But her main message was the same: Get vaccinated.

With that, Lessler agrees. "If we got enough people vaccinated, we could even stop the delta variant in its tracks," he says.

[Please see the original projections for the USA by the COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub at https://covid19scenariomodelinghub.org/viz.html.

All modeling exercises are dependent on the input variables, and we likely still have much to learn about the intrinsic pathogenicity of the delta variant from the epidemiologic and clinical experience of other countries, such as Israel. But this group comprises a number of epidemiologic modeling groups and approaches and, moreover, attempts to estimate a range of scenarios from best case to worst case. This is the group's 7th round; the group's 4th round projections were published in May 2021 (1).

[2] Israel: Pfizer vaccine efficacy decline
Date: Wed 21 Jul 2021 22:58 IDT
Source: The Times of Israel [edited]
https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-study-claims-major-drop-in-vaccine-protection-experts-dont-believe-it/


Vaccine effectiveness in preventing serious COVID-19 infection among the elderly has fallen to 50%, according to new Israeli figures, but some prominent experts are saying the data shouldn't be taken seriously. The Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccines were wowing Israelis with sky-high effectiveness rates until the rise of the delta variant. But according to data recently raised at a top-level Health Ministry meeting, the immunization's effectiveness in preventing serious illness is now at 80% for the general population and 50% for the elderly.

Israel's national research body for epidemiology, the Gertner Institute, conducted the research, and Dr. Amit Huppert from its bio-statistical unit told The Times of Israel that policymakers should pay attention. The government "should not be panicked but should take the data seriously, as it's a warning that should not be ignored," he said. "Most of us did not believe a month ago we could be in this situation." He added that policymakers didn't pay enough attention to data on the alpha variant which arose in Britain and spread quickly in Israel in early 2021.

But as the numbers ignite concern among Israelis, even the government's top expert adviser on coronavirus questioned their integrity. The approach taken could result in a "horribly skewed" outcome, argued Prof. Ran Balicer, chairman of Israel's national expert panel on COVID-19. "Any attempt to deduce severe illness vaccine effectiveness from semi-crude illness rates among the yes or no vaccinated is very, very risky," he maintained.

Infectious diseases doctor Yael Paran told The Times of Israel that she can't reconcile the figures on serious illness with the much more rosy reality she sees. "What we see in our hospital and around the world don't support this," she said. "I think the figures are exaggerated."

Huppert acknowledged that the statistics have their limitations. "These are early estimations based on small numbers, and there are all kinds of biases in the numbers," he said. But he insisted that despite the caveats, they still have great relevance.

But Paran, a senior physician at Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, argued that the problem with them runs deep, and the definition of "serious illness" has become misleading. It is used for patients whose oxygen saturation drops, which was a good indicator pre-vaccination as it signaled deterioration. But for vaccine-protected patients, it is often a brief state that doesn't signal significant deterioration, she said.

"Take a patient who is in my hospital now as an example," she said. "He is in his 80s and classed as severe but only because he had a mild drop in saturation. It was something that any other disease would cause, and which we're treating well with steroids, but he is classed as a serious case."

Dr. Dvir Aran, an expert in health statistics from the Technion -- Israel Institute of Technology, said he is concerned the Health Ministry is using "bad research" and allowing it to be presented without context. "The problems aren't with the vaccine, they are with the data," he said, branding as "false" the conclusions in the latest data and other research on how well the vaccine prevents infection. The research process "skews the results to make the vaccine seem less effective than it is," he told The Times of Israel.

Health Ministry data released in early July [2021] said the vaccine's effectiveness in preventing infection, which was over 90% pre-delta, is now at 64%. Such numbers are crunched by comparing infection rates and illness rates in vaccinated and unvaccinated people, to measure the vaccines' protection.

However, Aran said that people who decline to get vaccinated are, in disproportionately high numbers, people who are skeptical about the existence or danger of COVID-19, distrustful of health services, and overall relatively unlikely to get tested. "We are probably only finding, through testing, a minority of instances when unvaccinated people get the coronavirus -- and as the statistics rely on a comparison this makes effectiveness for the vaccinated seem much lower," Aran said.

When it comes to the latest data on serious illness, Aran said the number of people factored into the calculations is so small that small margins of error can cause a major impact on the bottom line. The research process is not conducive to accurate conclusions, he argues. The overall number of seriously ill in Israel is 63. The slice of the adult population that is unvaccinated is small, and for those over 60, who generate the most troubling statistic, it is tiny.

"The number of unvaccinated over-60s is actually smaller than we think. Some who appear to be unvaccinated are actually dead, as it can take time to record deaths; others are protected by recovery from the illness," commented Aran.

He believes that statistics falsely pointing to poor vaccine performance are harmful because they make people more reluctant to take the shots. "This hurts compliance of people with vaccinations," he said. "If you're saying to the public that vaccines work less, it hurts enthusiasm for them."

[This and other articles reflect the almost immediate caution, if not skepticism, among many Israeli experts about the data presented in the Israeli government's report of a sharp decline in the efficacy of the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine, which was originally posted here yesterday (22 Jul 2021) in COVID-19 update (250), item [3C] (find link below in the See Also section).

Clearly there are many moving pieces in gauging vaccine effectiveness, and the current controversy in Israel over the meaning of effectiveness data will doubtless be replicated in other countries, regardless of which vaccines are utilized, as they intensify their own COVID-19 vaccination campaigns.

The Tokyo Organizing Committee for the Olympics and Paralympics announced on 23 Jul 2021 that a PCR test for the new coronavirus [COVID-19] revealed 19 new positives for the Olympics, including 3 athletes from overseas. The cumulative total since 1 Jul 2021 is 106, of which 56 are domestic and 50 are overseas cases.

One of the 3 players revealed on this day [23 Jul 2021] is a Czech female beach volleyball player. According to the Czech Olympic Committee, a total of 6 people, including 4 athletes and doctors, from the men's beach volleyball, table tennis, and cycling teams, have been found infected, and it is possible that they have spread [the virus] on charter flights to Tokyo. No one is seriously ill.

The committee said on Twitter that not everyone was wearing masks on board and would investigate further the cause of the spread of the infection.
