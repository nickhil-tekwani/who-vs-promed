The genetic characterization of the prototypical community acquired MRSA
(CA-MRSA) strain, the clone that caused the 4 pediatric deaths in Minnesota
and North Dakota, revealed a unique genotype. Both the genetic background
of the CA-MRSA strain and the organization of the element that harbors the
_mecA_ gene, termed the staphylococcal chromosomal cassette (SCC_mec_),
were distinguishable from the major nosocomial MRSA clones.
Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, multilocus sequence typing, and _spa_
typing, all methods used to compare the genetic background of _S. aureus_
strains, distinguished the CA-MRSA from nosocomial MRSA clones. These
strains were further differentiated on the basis of a novel SCC_mec_ (type
IV). This element differs from types I-III on the basis of its small size,
as it does not harbor other integrated antibiotic resistance determinants,
and it encodes a functional recombinase which facilitates its movement.
The genotyping of CA-MRSA has revealed that this clone has spread across
the US and commonly cultured from soft-skin infections. A current
hypothesis is that the panton-valentine leukocidin and enterotoxins B and C
play are involved in the "hyper-virulence" of community acquired-MRSA.
