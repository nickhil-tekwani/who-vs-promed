"A few adult cases have been reported but mostly children are affected,"
Colo Boitshoko, spokesman for the Ministry of Health, told IRIN. "We had a
lot of rain for this time of the year -- normally we have some diarrhoea
cases around this time, but it never turns into an epidemic. The rain is
the underlying cause."
Kutloano Leshomo, Communications Officer for the United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF), said laboratory tests of samples from Francistown, conducted
by the Centres for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta, USA, suggested the
outbreak had come from various sources.
"Contaminated water, unhygienic practices at the household level, poor
sanitation, infant feeding-bottle contamination with human waste and
ongoing person-to-person transmission" had all contributed to spreading the
disease. The tests indicated the presence of Enteropathogenic _E. coli_
bacteria and Cryptosporidium.
Water authorities, "especially in villages, have acknowledged that they do
not have capacity and resources for regular monitoring of the quality of
water, meaning that sometimes water is not chlorinated," Leshomo said.
Boitshoko pointed out that "we have contamination in the water, mainly in
rural areas where the majority of the population lives -- village
reservoirs and natural ponds have been affected, and people are drinking
rainwater".
The reason it has taken so long to control the outbreak, Leshomo suggested,
was "first, because the Ministry of Health lacks sufficient capacity to
handle an emergency of this nature, especially diarrhoea coupled with
malnutrition, but also because some of the issues are outside the
jurisdiction of the Ministry of Health, the water supply authority in the
villages, for example, falls under the Ministry of Local Government."
According to Dr. Dorothy Ochola, Project Officer at UNICEF, "severe, acute
malnutrition, secondary to diarrhoea, is contributing to the high fatality
rate". Since the onset of the outbreak, a steady increase in cases of
malnutrition-related illnesses, especially marasmus and kwashiorkor, have
been registered. "It is estimated that approximately 450 to 500 children
are in urgent need of therapeutic feeding," she said.
The outbreak is widespread and 23 264 cases have been reported across all
of Botswana's districts. Ministry of Health statistics recorded 4564 cases
in the southeastern region of Serowe-Palapye, believed to be the origin of
the epidemic, and 4391 cases in Kweneng East, the areas that have been hit
hardest.
With the number of weekly cases on the decline -- 1201 reported last week
-- Boitshoko said the "epidemic is still not under control but it is going
in the right direction". A concerted effort by the World Health
Organisation, UNICEF, the International Red Cross, the CDC, Medecins sans
Frontieres and local water authorities, coordinated by the Ministry of
Health, has accelerated the response to the outbreak.
"The numbers have been going down due to the various interventions that
have been put in place, such as concerted social mobilisation to educate
parents," Leshomo noted. "We are now very hopeful," Boitshoko said. "We
should not have to lose so many children to such a disease. Diarrhoea
should not have to kill."

[From the more detailed information now available, it is clear that the
diarrhoea outbreak is due to general problems with the quality of the water
supply in areas of Botswana, where surface water is relied upon for
drinking water. Cryptosporidium is certainly one possible etiological
agent, but _E. coli_ and most probably viruses will also be found. We
hereby cut the thread on the outbreak of diarrhoea in Botswana. - Mod.EP]
