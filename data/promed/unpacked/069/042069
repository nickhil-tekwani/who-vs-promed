A Standardbred racehorse residing in Genesee County, Michigan, has tested positive for neurologic equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1), state veterinarian Steve Halstead, DVM, confirmed 2 Jan 2013.

Halstead told TheHorse.com that the affected horse participated in a race at Sports Creek Raceway, a haul-in only racetrack in Swartz Creek, Michigan, on 22 Dec 2012, and began showing neurologic signs of disease on 23 Dec 2012. That day, the animal's owner/trainer contacted their veterinarian, who took samples and sent them for evaluation at the state diagnostic lab, Halstead said. He was informed of the positive test results 28 Dec 2012, shortly before 5:00 pm, he said.

"(The horse's condition) worsened through the 1st part of that week; in fact the veterinarian thought it was pretty much over on Wednesday (26 Dec 2012), but he since has recovered," Halstead said. "There's one other horse in the same stable, but there's no indication that it's ill."

Halstead noted that both horses had previously received rhinopneumonitis [EHV-1] vaccinations, "which is normal procedure for this veterinarian and this trainer. It wasn't following infection, just a routine vaccination."

Halstead said both horses have been placed under quarantine, which will last at least 21 days.

The Sports Creek harness meet has concluded, Halstead said, and harness racing does not resume in Michigan until mid-January [2013]. Several harness racing tracks across the country, including The Meadowlands Racetrack in New Jersey and Balmoral Park in Illinois, have placed entry restrictions on horses that have raced at Sports Creek in recent days. The Meadowlands, for instance, is denying horses that raced at Sports Creek after 1 Dec 2012, until further notice.

"Right now we're just waiting for the quarantine period and monitoring the horses," Halstead said, noting that the horses' veterinarian and owner/trainer are working closely with officials to monitor the situation. Although it's not transmissible to humans, EHV-1 is highly contagious among horses and camelids, and it is generally passed from horse to horse via aerosol transmission (when affected animals sneeze/cough) and contact with nasal secretions. The disease can cause a variety of ailments in equines, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and myeloencephalopathy (EHM, the neurologic form).

Myeloencephalopathy is characterized by fever, ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the hind limbs, and incontinence. Should a horse with potential EHV-1 exposure display any of the aforementioned clinical signs, a veterinarian should be called to obtain samples and test for the disease.

The Horse.com will continue to provide updates as more information becomes available.

[The disease is often abbreviated as EHV for equine herpes virus or EHM for equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy.

Equine herpesvirus (EHV-1) infection in horses can cause respiratory and neurological disease, abortion in mares, and neonatal foal death. The neurological form of the disease is known as equine herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHM) and has the potential to cause high morbidity and mortality.

EHV-1 is easily spread and typically has an incubation period between 2-10 days. Respiratory shedding of the virus generally occurs for 7-10 days but may persist longer in infected horses. For this reason, the isolation period recommendation for confirmed positive EHM cases is 21 days. Clinical signs of EHM in horses may include nasal discharge, incoordination, hindquarter weakness, recumbency, lethargy, urine dribbling, and diminished tail tone. The prognosis for EHM positive horses depends on the severity of signs and the period of recumbency. Employing supportive treatment with intravenous fluids, anti-inflammatory drugs, anti-viral drugs, and other supportive measures may be beneficial, since there is no specific treatment for EHM.

Currently, no EHV-1 equine vaccine has a label claim for protection against the neurological strain of the virus.

This is a disease that has a profound effect on horses and owners. Horses have a very tough time recovering from this disease and owners have a difficult time treating or euthanizing their pets/companions.

This disease is not to be toyed with. Owners should heed the words of the veterinarians. Enforce the rest and isolation of your horse. Protect your horse and other horses as well.
