DRC: Ebolavirus kills 4 out of 7 cases in Orientale province
------------------------------------------------------------
[Ebola virus disease] has killed 4 people among 7 cases in the Haut Uele District of Orientale Province of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), according to a statement on 14 Aug 2012 by Jean-Marc Madindi, provincial medical inspector of Orientale Province. According to Dr Madindi, 3 deaths among 6 cases occurred in the district of Haut Uele, and a angle death in Dungu district. Samples from these cases have been sent to a diagnostic Laboratory in Uganda for confirmation by laboratory techniques, and the results are awaited. The provincial health authorities are being supported by the Belgian branch of Medecins Sans Frontieres.

The chief medical officer of health of the Butembo District Health District, Dr Mundama Witende, has advised the urban populations of Beni and Butembo, which are located along the border with Uganda, to adopt strict procedures to prevent cross-border movements without good reason. The population have also been instructed to avoid consumption of meat derived from primates. Likewise, the population has been advised to avoid contact with the blood or secretions of patients suspected to have contracted [Ebola virus disease]. The bodies of those thought to have died as a result of ebolavirus infection should not be touched or washed.

An outbreak of [Ebola virus disease] was reported at the beginning of July [2012] in Uganda at a place located 200 kilometres [124 mi] from the capital Kampala and about 50 kilometres [31 mi] from the border with the Orientale and Nord-Kivu provinces of the DRC.

Ebola fever is highly contagious through direct contact with blood, bodily fluids, or when carelessly handling contaminated corpses. Since ebolavirus virus was first identified in 1976, 15 epidemics have affected central Africa, including the DRC, Gabon, Congo/Brazzaville [Republic of the Congo], Sudan, and Uganda. In the DRC, [Ebola virus disease] has previously occurred in 1976 in Equateur (northwest), in 1995 in Bandundu (southwest), in 1999 and 2000 in Orientale Province, and in 2007 and 2008 in Kasai Occidental (central).

[The Orientale province of the Democratic Republic of Congo is adjacent to the region of Uganda currently experiencing an outbreak of Ebola virus disease. It is tempting to infer that the 2 outbreaks are related. The Ugandan outbreak has been caused by Sudan virus. Confirmation and identification of the virus responsible for the DRC outbreak are awaited.
