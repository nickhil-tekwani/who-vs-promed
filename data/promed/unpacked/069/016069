On 23 Sep 2014, a cow developed symptoms of illness and was immediately slaughtered in the town of Tramutola (Potenza province, Basilicata region), on a farm with stall-housed animals. The carcass was then destroyed as a result of internal injuries. On 2 Oct 2014, a 2nd cow on the same farm was found dead. The analysis on its blood indicated anthrax.

The stockman who had slaughtered the cow has been tracked and treated with antibiotic therapy because he had developed skin lesions.

The tests on the DNA extracted from his eschar have confirmed anthrax and the genotype was the same as that isolated from the 2nd dead animal.

The forage was seized and all the animals vaccinated, with a 2nd treatment after 14 days.

The genotype of the _Bacillus anthracis_ is the same as that responsible for a provincial epidemic in 2011.

It is an atypical outbreak (with a high risk for human infection) and at the moment we are investigating the forage...

By definition, when housed livestock come down with anthrax they did not get it from grazing. It had to have been fed to them. Contaminated hay has been implicated a fair number of times. The usual story is that the ground was wet during haymaking and thus contaminated mud from an old anthrax grave got incorporated into a hale during baling. Proving it by recovering the pathogen from the hay can be a challenge, not least because by the time this needs to be done the specific contaminated bale is long gone. Another wintertime source is contaminated concentrates from the use of inadequately sterilized bone meal, but as the strain in this outbreak matches that of 2011, the source is more likely to be local and thus "forage". If the forage was purchased there is a probability that other herds purchasing forage from the same source may also have suffered unexpected livestock deaths. Worth checking just in case.

We thank Antonio for this report, and wish him luck in his investigation. - Mod.MHJ]
