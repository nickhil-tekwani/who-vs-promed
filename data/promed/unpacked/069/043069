The sun is out, but some pets are feeling under the weather. "The most common thing that we're seeing right now are parasitic infections that affect the intestinal tract," said Associate Veterinarian Dr. Andrea Pennington.

These types of parasites are most commonly found in water, according to Dr. Pennington. "Our pets take [them] in either by drinking the water or licking the water; even if the contaminated water gets on them, and they lick it off their fur, they can get exposed to these parasites," she explained. Some symptoms include diarrhea, stomach pain or loss of appetite. "If they're eating dinner, and all of the sudden they've only eaten half of it, there might be something going on," Dr. Pennington adds.

Most of the water in Horry County has receded, but Pennington says dogs are still at risk because the soil remains damp. "Certain fungal species that usually aren't very common this time of year are having a chance to bloom, to come up out of the soil," said Dr. Pennington. Dogs will then inhale these spores, and Dr. Pennington says they can cause respiratory issues. She had also seen quite a few snakebites since the flood.

Dr. Pennington says the older a dog is, the more at risk it is to catching a parasite or an infection. If you suspect your dog is sick, she says it's best to take your pet to the vet.

[The key point of this local report is not the accuracy of the veterinarian's biology but her perception of a sudden increase in clinical cases of intestinal canine parasitisms. Is this just a singular observation, or have other companion animal veterinarians in South Carolina had a similar clinical experience? And livestock vets? I ask because one of the functions of ProMED is to act as a trip-wire for unexpected events, to verify, and to warn others. At this point, we just have an observation of a possible abnormality in relation to local flooding in Horry County.

My fellow moderator, Arnon Shimshony, kindly provided me with this reference for US canine parasite prevalence: Susan E. Little, Eileen M. Johnson, David Lewis, Renee P. Jaklitsch et al. Prevalence of intestinal parasites in pet dogs in the United States. Veterinary Parasitology 166 (2009) 144-152 (ref 1, 2009) doi:10.1016/j.vetpar.2009.07.044: "The most commonly identified intestinal parasites in dogs in the US, as reviewed in 2008 (published 2009, Ref 1; copy attached for convenience), were ascarids (2.2 percent), hookworms (2.5 percent), whipworms (1.2 percent), Giardia (4.0 percent), and Cystoisospora (4.4 percent). ... Giardia is an intestinal canine parasite known to show significant seasonal variation and might be the parasite to which the practitioner cited in the article referred when addressing -- in rather unspecific terms -- canine infestation related to floods."

Have any other of our subscribers in South Carolina seen anything similar, and, if so, in particular, which parasites? - Mod.MHJ
