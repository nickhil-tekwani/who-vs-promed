New cases of tuberculosis in cattle
-----------------------------------
Detection of new cases of tuberculosis (TB) in cows on the farm of the
prison Riche Lieu. The officers and inmates of this prison will
undergo a screening test for tuberculosis.

After a site visit yesterday [29 Oct 2011] by Ministers Faugoo and
Bundhoo, the decision was taken to slaughter all the livestock of the
farm as a precaution. The [herd] is composed of 43 cows and 16 goats.

Health services say the tests will continue to try to find the source
of the TB cases. The officers reassured, however, that other livestock
are not at risk.

[According to the most recent periodic OIE report from Mauritius
(January-June 2010), bovine tuberculosis is included among the
OIE-listed animal diseases absent in Mauritius during the reporting
period; its last reported occurrence in Mauritius dates back to 2000.

A suspected case was reported in October 2011 (see reference, below);
ProMED-mail's RFI has remained, so far, pending. This related,
inter-alia, to the identification of the causative agent as
_Mycotuberculosis bovis_ or otherwise. - Mod.AS]
