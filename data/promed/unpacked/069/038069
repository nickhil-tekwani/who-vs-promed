[The FMD event caused by the strain above had started in northeast Israel on 2 Apr 2018, affecting free ranging beef cattle, as reported to the OIE on 9 Apr 2018; the causative agent of this and subsequent outbreaks was genotyped O/ME-SA/PanAsia-2(QOM-15). This strain (sublineage QOM) had not been found earlier in Israel and is considered a new introduction, the route(s) of which are not (yet) clarified. Previous FMD events in Israel, caused by FMDV O PanAsia-2, involved sublineages ANT-10 (in 2012), and FAR-09 (in 2013/14).

On 29 Apr 2018, 4 additional outbreaks were reported to the OIE in follow-up report no 1, addressing a large dairy farm, 3 free-ranging beef cattle herds, and a cluster of wild mountain gazelles (_Gazella gazella_, a protected species), all distributed within a region located south of Lake Kinneret ("the Sea of Tiberias"), adjacent to the Jordan river separating Israel from the Kingdom of Jordan.

During June 2018, 4 outbreaks, caused most probably by the same genotype, were reported from the Palestinian territories (West Bank); see 20180626.5877233 and 20180715.5905958. This event is considered not yet resolved ("continuing"). - Mod.AS
