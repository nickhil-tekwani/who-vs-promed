[1] Surveillance in market, precautionary measure announced

Tests carried out on 112 camels by the Agriculture Ministry have found that 85 percent of the animals carry the deadly Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS).

The tests, conducted in conjunction with the Ministry of Health, were taken at the Al-Inam Central Market in Jeddah, according to a report in a local publication on Monday [1 Feb 2016].

This was confirmed by Habed bin Abdulaziz Al-Batshaan, undersecretary for animal resources at the Agriculture Ministry. He said preventative measures must continue to be taken by dealers, with mandatory use of gloves and masks.

He said all those handling the animals must make sure they do not touch their mouths, eyes and noses until they have washed their hands properly [see comment].

They also need to make sure the general surroundings are kept clean and remove the waste of the animals into especially earmarked locations. He said handlers must wash their hands and bodies with soap and water after they leave work. The slaughter of animals has to take place in official slaughterhouses under the direct supervision of veterinarians, with special clothes that must be removed before leaving.

Since 2012, at least 551 people have died of the virus in the Kingdom, while 733 who contracted the illness have recovered. There are currently 5 people who are being treated for the virus, according to the Health Ministry's website on Tuesday [2 Feb 2016].

Last month [January 2016], the ministry's Deputy Health Minister for Public Health Abdulaziz bin Saeed warned that young camels tend to carry the virus in winter and can pass it on to humans.

He said the ministry had conducted a survey on 160 camels in Jeddah and 50 of the juvenile animals were found carrying the virus.

"This is a dangerous situation, where people could easily be affected unless they take suitable precautions," he said.

He had also announced that the ministry would reveal the results of research into vaccines for MERS.

Officials from the ministry and King Abdul Aziz City for Science and Technology (KAACST) were studying various reports from researchers, he said.

[2] Affected camel farm, butcher infected

The Ministry of Agriculture reported that 11 out of 20 camels in the farms of Al-Khumra governorate are inflicted with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

Deputy Minister of Agriculture Hamad Bin Abdulaziz Al-Batshan said recently one of the butchers working at a farm in Al-Khumra, south of Jeddah, was diagnosed with coronavirus infection. "The ministry promptly decided to take necessary health and safety measures, in addition to enforcing regulations imposed by the Ministry of Health to avoid more cases of infections among people who closely work with camels," said Al-Batshan.

He added that the Ministry of Agriculture hired a veterinary team to do a mass scanning and checkup of all of the camels in the farm.

"The farmers are prohibited from transferring the animals from the farm to the camel market. The diagnosis by the veterinarian team is alarming. More than 50 percent of the camels in the farm are infected. We need to take extra precautions to ensure that no more butchers get infected," said Al-Batshan.

He said the Ministry of Health, Jeddah Municipality and Al-Khumra Police are all cooperating to contain the situation.

"It seems that we had an outbreak of the virus in the farm. We are trying to find the source of the outbreak and the cause. The camels will undergo several tests and only the camels that are free from the virus will be taken to the camel market to be butchered or sold," said Al-Batshan.

He said the infected animals will be quarantined for up to a month and will not be released to be butchered until it is ascertained that they are completely free of the virus.

"We are currently raising awareness among people who work closely with camels and among consumers. The Ministry of Agriculture will not condone any potential risks of the virus and will exert maximum effort to contain the outbreak," said Al-Batshan.

[Saudi Arabia has eventually officially recognized the possible role camels may play in the epidemiology of MERS-CoV in humans, leading to its recent official notification to the OIE and to the announcement, by the undersecretary for animal resources at the Agriculture Ministry (item 1 above) of severe preventive measures, apparently involving "dealers". It will be helpful to note if the described measures (e.g. "mandatory use of gloves and masks") are restricted to dealers, to animal markets and to slaughterhouses only, or rather to a wider circle of camel handlers and owners within the Kingdom.

It will also be interesting to obtain the age(s) of the positive and negative camels on the Al-Khumra farm (item 2 above), and their respective clinical status.

What was the relationship/connection between the affected farm and the 2 other installations mentioned, namely a slaughterhouse and an animal market? Was the slaughter carried out legally, in an approved, veterinary controlled/inspected slaughterhouse -- or otherwise? - Mod.AS
