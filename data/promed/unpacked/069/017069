Ha Tinh Province faces a high risk of the spread of the H5N1 avian flu due to inadequate community awareness and determination of local authorities to prevent its transmission. Nearly 1400 poultry birds were culled during a recent H5N1 outbreak in Thach Ha and Can Loc Districts of the central Ha Tinh Province, the provincial veterinary division said.

Previously, an outbreak hit the household of Phan Nhat Thanh in Phu Loc Commune in Can Loc District on 17 Sep 2015, when nearly 400 chickens and ducks fell sick and died with avian flu symptoms. All samples tested positive for the H5N1 virus.

A week later, authorities detected another outbreak among 1000 poultry birds in Thach Tri Commune in Thach Ha District. The veterinary division said all sick and dead poultry birds were raised in unhygienic conditions and had not been vaccinated against the H5N1 virus.

Phu Loc People's Committee vice-chairman Nguyen Xuan Chuong said that breeders' awareness was inadequate, especially regarding vaccination. Just 2000 of the commune's 10 000 poultry birds have been vaccinated in 2015. This showed that the local authority and the people were not yet involved in disease prevention in the area, Chuong said.

The division also said the poultry vaccination rate was low, at more than 12 per cent in the province. The rates were even lower in several districts, such as 3 per cent in Can Loc and 2 per cent in Thach Ha. There is, thus, a very high risk of the spread of the H5N1 virus in the coming months.

The provincial agriculture and rural development department has asked localities to take efforts to prevent the spread of the H5N1 disease, focus on improving communication and poultry vaccination, maintain close supervision, and to handle new outbreaks immediately.
