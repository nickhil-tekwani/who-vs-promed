INFECTION CONTROL - NORTH CAROLINA, USA
=======================================
Date: Fri, 31 May 1996 22:56:24 -0400
From: ChemstRN@aol.com

Hello from a small hospital near Charlotte, NC. Lake Norman Regional
Medical Center. We have approx. 120 beds, but census runs near 50. I have
been the ICP for four years, starting from scratch. Wonderful
field, and I take this opportunity now, to thank all of you (who I DO
consider experts) for reaching out to me daily to teach me.
We have large hospitals nearby, Carolina Medical Center, Presbyterian and
Baptist and Chapel Hill. Chapel Hill I suppose is the nearest Guru to me.
I know, from the State APIC chapter
[Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology]
(I am on the Program Committee) that this is only beginning to sprout on the
Internet, their learning and their ability [to] access. There have been
articles on the Internet in our National bulletin. If you are interested I
will correspond later with the email address. I have tried to increase the
knowledge; at our June State meeting we are having a speaker on the Internet.
Being in this small town, it has been difficult at times to validate the
knowledge, the questions and answers that I have. I have tried to build up
my knowledge with magazine articles. One of these areas being
antibiotic-resistance. I will share this with you. Last year 41% of our
_Staph. aureus_ isolates were MRSA. This year it is down to 32%. As of yet
I have only read, and am still planning my attack. One area that recently I
encountered was a local nursing home (but from a very large group), stating
that it was necessary to have 2 negative cultures before the
patient could return. The problem here being, the patient was colonized in
the first place on arrival, and they have no idea how many more are
colonized. So, that is one place I will begin.
As for VRE, suprisingly enough we have had two cases. One, from a patient
who had recently been in a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania hospital. The other:
a 98 yr old
automobile vehicle accident [victim], who it developed in. Yes, I was suprised
to say the least, but, having just returned from the National APIC
conference, knew just what to do.
In 1995 we had 6 isolates of _Strep._ pneumonia resistant to penicillin. I
believe this to be alot, but as of yet have found nothing to validate my
thinking.

To my best knowledge, North Carolina is *not* monitoring ARO, however, I
believe recently in the MMWR it said that New Jersey was monitoring
it.....as are other states.
Let me know if I can be of further assistance in this area. And in the
meantime, I will sit quietly and learn, from all of you. Thanks.
