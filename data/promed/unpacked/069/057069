On Friday [25 Mar 2022], Agriculture Victoria announced it had again detected Japanese encephalitis virus at one new piggery.

They said the detection is the result of national surveillance efforts to identify new cases and determine the extent and spread of the disease and the source of its introduction.

Japanese encephalitis has also been confirmed in piggeries in New South Wales, Queensland, and South Australia.

Agriculture Victoria is also working closely with both the pig and horse industries in response to the disease.

A number of suspected cases are under investigation.

Detections have been confirmed at a total of 15 properties in the Wangaratta, Moira, Greater Shepparton, Campaspe, Gannawarra, Loddon, Greater Bendigo, and Northern Grampians local government areas.

Agriculture Victoria's incident management team continues to work closely with industry, conducting surveillance activities, and providing advice and information to farmers, livestock, and horse owners.

Infection is not spread directly from pigs to people, and there is no risk to humans from eating pig meat.

In general, spread is through the movement of migratory water birds and through the movement of infected mosquitoes, often over long distances.

It does not usually spread directly from animal to animal (that is, it is not considered contagious).

Victorians are being reminded to protect themselves from mosquito bites.

[Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) has been infecting pigs in commercial piggeries in Victoria state since mid-February 2022. A 14 Feb 2022 report stated that pigs affected in Victoria had stillbirths, mummified fetuses, and tremors in neonatal piglets. The geographic area of JEV transmission continues to expand.

Humans can take measures to reduce the risk of JEV infection by avoiding mosquito bites but that is not feasible for pigs. Vaccination campaign planning for people is underway. - Mod.TY
