[The number of chikungunya virus infection cases continues to increase except on St. Martin, where they have declined during the past week. The situation in mainland Guiana awaits clarification. There are many suspected cases, indicating local transmission, but only 4 have been confirmed, and all of these are imported from islands where the outbreak is occurring. The risk of spread to other countries in the Americas where dengue virus is being transmitted currently remains serious. Dengue virus mosquito vectors can transmit chikungunya virus also.

Maps showing the location of St. Martin/St. Maarten can be accessed at http://goo.gl/maps/TN1DJ and at http://healthmap.org/r/9zAI; Guadeloupe island at http://healthmap.org/r/9Puc; Martinique at http://healthmap.org/r/9Pud; and St. Barthelemy at http://www.caribbean-direct.com/St-Barth-Direct/Maps/STBmapsM.html. Several of the island reports above have maps of case distributions within the given island. - Mod.TY]
