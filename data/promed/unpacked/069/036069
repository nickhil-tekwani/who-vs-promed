[From Benenson A., Control of Communicable Diseases in Man: Infectious
agent is _Rickettsia tsutsugamushi_ (multiple strains), transmitted by
trombiculid mites, which pass the infection through their eggs. Natural
host is wild rodents, their mites are picked up by people who enter their
habitat. Cannot be transmitted person to person. Occurs throughout Asia.
Treatable with tetracycline. Prevention is by impregnating clothes &
blankets with permethrin & benzyl benzoate, and using mite repellent such
as Deet (R) - Mod.JW
