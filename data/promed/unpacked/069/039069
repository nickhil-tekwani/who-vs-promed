National Security Minister John Michuki says the aflatoxin outbreak that
has killed 14 people in Makueni, Kitui and Machakos Districts has now been
contained.
He said there was no cause of panic, as Provincial Administration officials
were working jointly with medical health personnel to destroy contaminated
maize and were replacing it with food stock provided by the Ministry of
Special Programmes.
Speaking in his office, Michuki said the officers were also sensitizing the
affected communities on proper storage of food.

WFP denies reports of sending toxic maize to Kenya
---------------------------------
The United Nations World Food Program (WFP) said here Friday it is taking
precautionary measures following food poisoning in eastern Kenya caused by
toxic maize.
In a statement issued here, WFP, which supplies the food for the east
African nation's school feeding programs, said all its food was always
tested for aflatoxin before being handed over to the Kenyan Education Ministry.
"WFP is confident that no aflatoxin is present in any of the food provided
by the organization to WFP-supported programs in Kenya," the UN agency said.
The WFP statement follows the seizure of hundreds of bags of maize and peas
donated by the US government and supplied by the UN agency after samples
from one of the schools were found to be contaminated. WFP confirmed that
it supplied the food for the schools program, adding that it was concerned
about reports associating it with the contaminated food.
WFP attributed the possible contamination to "poor storage conditions and
inadequate handling, particularly during the rainy season, as well as
mixing of maize from many sources, increasing the risk of aflatoxin
contamination, which can spread to previously unaffected commodities."
WFP at the same time expressed doubt about the findings by the government
chemists and requested that an international testing firm be called to
repeat the tests on the grain and pulses supplied to the schools.
The UN agency said schools have been advised to separate all commodities
with mould until re-testing takes place in order to safeguard children's
health.
WFP has ensured the highest health standards of all food commodities
provided by the agency.
15 people have lost their lives after eating poisonous maize and several
others with such symptoms have been treated in local health centers in
eastern Kenya. Maize, a staple food in the east African nation, is milled
into flour to make a porridge known as ugali.
Aflatoxin is a poisonous fungus that grows on cereals harvested or stored
under damp or humid conditions. The fungus flourishes in these
circumstances and when consumed is poisonous to the liver.
In June 2004, more than 100 people were killed and 180 others hospitalized
after suffering from such poisoning in the same districts.
Signs of aflatoxin poisoning include yellow eyes, vomiting, abdominal and
leg swelling, general weakness, drowsiness, coma and death, according to
the Kenyan health officials.

[ProMED-mail posting 20050514.1324 provides more details and comments
regarding aflatoxin.
Aflatoxin is a secondary metabolite of a mold. Consequently the mold may
have died and no longer be present, but what it produced is still present
and not visible to the naked eye. It is impossible to test all the grain,
because that would leave no grain for consumption. The test for the
aflatoxin essentially consumes the grain.
Aflatoxin is known to be in "hot spots". These "spots" may be very high in
aflatoxin, such that when the grain is ground, that small area of aflatoxin
is then spread into many containers for many destinations.
Although testing was done, it could have missed a hot spot. Furthermore,
the toxin could have formed within the storage system after the commodities
were delivered. Damp or high humidity assists in the formation of the mold
and consequently the toxin.
The 1st article indicated that officers were educating communities with
regard to proper storage. Perhaps they should consider inspection of the
facilities as they educate the communities. It would be difficult not to
suspect all storage areas at this time. - Mod.TG]
