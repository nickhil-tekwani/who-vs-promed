Dengue has claimed 3 young lives in Aklan since its outbreak, but
health officials assure cases are now declining.

According to Dr. Maria Magpusao, Chief of the Technical Services
Division of the Provincial Health Office said based on their records
[in 2007], the month of August had the highest number of dengue cases
with 198 while from 1-22 Sep 2007, there were 145 cases. In June,
there were 23 cases of dengue in the province, while July registered
125 cases.

Dr. Magpusao said the figures have not gone beyond outbreak level
compared with the past years' [2006] record of the province, however,
she advised that patients suspected of having dengue must seek
medical attention right away.

When inspected by provincial health officials, Dr. Magpusao said all
areas where there were dengue deaths had the presence of the dengue
mosquito vector, _Aedes aegypti_. The households also stored water in
uncovered containers, which were used as breeding areas by the deadly
mosquitoes.

"Mosquitoes also breed in plants like bromeliads. We already advised
households and schools to get rid of their bromeliads, because the
pineapple-like plant's center is used as breeding ground of
mosquitoes," Dr. Magpusao revealed.

Dr. Magpusao revealed that during her team's visits to barangays
[villages], they discovered that whole bamboos used as post for
fences of houses, when filled with rainwater, are also breeding
grounds of dengue mosquitoes. She advised house owners to fill the
hollowed posts with soil or sand so mosquitoes could not breed there.

The Department of health (DOH) has issued a nationwide dengue fever
alert and has asked hospitals to designate fast lanes for dengue
patients. According to a DOH report, Region 6, where Aklan belongs,
has the most number of dengue victims, followed by Region 7, and NCR
(National Capital Region).

The Tainan city government reported Friday [12 Oct 2007] that the
number of confirmed cases of dengue fever has broken the 500 mark and
now stands at 511, making it the city's worst ever outbreak of the
disease. City government officials said they discovered clusters of
dengue fever infection in individual households in both northern and
eastern parts of the city and urged the public to be on guard.

With the National Athletic Meet due to open in the southern city next
week, the Tainan city government has pulled out all the stops to
eradicate the mosquitoes and ensure the safety of participating
athletes. Health officials also urged the public to remove any
containers of standing waters that could serve as breeding grounds
for the disease-bearing mosquitoes.

The recent development of dengue fever in people over 15 years of age
is puzzling officials, reported local health centers.

According to the statistics, the Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) Hospital for
Tropical Diseases has lately been receiving huge patient loads, with
an average of around 70-100 dengue fever cases per week.

This disease, which typically affects young children, is increasingly
being diagnosed in adults. Regardless of age, the hospital is not
equipped to handle the numbers. Patients have had to share beds or
stay temporarily in corridors.

According to Mr. Nguyen Dac Tho, Vice Director of the Preventive
Health Center in HCMC, the risk of dengue fever is still high. The
outbreak areas in the suburbs of the city are currently under
control; however the districts in the inner city such as Binh Thanh,
Tan Binh, Districts 8 and 11, and others are now reported as epidemic
areas.

Around 300 dengue cases are being hospitalized every week for
diagnosis in the city. The patients are mostly immigrants who come
from other provinces and cities looking for work, and most are living
in the slums. Since the beginning of the year [2007], the epidemic
has killed 6 including 2 adults.

The causes of the demographic change, from children to adults, have
not yet been brought to light. However, scientists theorize the
reasons may include a decline in general disease immunity within the
community.

The Steering Committee for Dengue Fever Protection asked the
localities and health centers to help curb the spread of dengue fever
by providing knowledge and education about the disease, transmission,
and prevention to all people. The committee also mandates that people
who have a fever come to health centers immediately for timely
treatment.

[4] India (Delhi)
Date: Sun 14 Oct 2007

<http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/PoliticsNation/First_case_of_Dengue_death_in_Delhi/articleshow/2456766.cms>


The 1st dengue death of the Capital was reported on Saturday [13 Oct
2007] as a 22-year-old man succumbed to the disease at Maharaja
Agrasen Hospital in Punjabi Bagh. He was a resident of Narela. This
is the 1st dengue death to be reported this year [2007] from the
Capital,'' said MCD (Municipal Corporation of Delhi) health officer N
K Yadav.

Yadav said this year [2007], the number of cases being reported are
much less than what had been reported by this time last year: in
2006, the 1st dengue death had occurred as early as 19 Aug at AIIMS
(All India Institute of Medical Sciences). By 14 Oct, 28 dengue
deaths had been reported in the Capital. This number steadily rose to
42 by 20 Oct, which by the end of the month, had further risen to 58.

''On an average, 8-15 cases come in everyday. This is still
negligible compared to the number of cases that were reported last
year [2006] during this time. The total number of dengue cases
reported so far is 197,'' added Yadav.

While 8 new dengue cases were reported on Saturday [13 Oct 2007],
last year [2006] on 13 Oct, 77 fresh cases had been reported. In
2006, by this day [14 Oct], a total of 843 new cases of dengue had
been reported, more than 4 times [that] of the 197 reported this year
[2007].

Avoiding water from accumulating and keeping water meant for storage
covered are the best precautions as even a cap full can provide
breeding ground for as many as 250 eggs. Using mosquito repellents
and creams and wearing full-sleeved clothes can go a long way in
preventing the disease.

The risk of a dengue epidemic in Piracicaba, 162 km (101 mi) from Sao
Paulo, led the prefecture and the Superintendency for Endemic Control
to intensify the fight against the [dengue vector] _Aedes aegypti_
mosquito breeding sites. Action is anticipated in 45 days.

A [vector] control group of 50 agents is in the city now. This Monday
(8 Oct 2007) they will be treating buildings in Vila Cristina, the
neighborhood where most of the 1786 dengue cases have been registered
this year [2007].

Global health officials have noted sharp rises in the number of
dengue fever cases in recent months, particularly in Latin American,
Caribbean, and Asian countries where the disease is endemic.

A recent surveillance update from the World Health Organization's
(WHO's) Southeast Asia office in New Delhi reported that Thailand has
more than 40 000 cases so far this year [2007], reflecting a 27
percent increase over 2006, Deutsche Presse Agentur (DPA) reported on
9 Oct [2007]. Indonesia's total of 100 000 cases represents a 10
percent increase over last year [2006], and Myanmar has reported
almost 12 000 cases -- a third more than it reported in 2006.

The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), which tracks and manages
health issues for the WHO in Latin American and Caribbean countries,
reported on 4 Oct [2007] that the disease is reaching epidemic levels
in some of the locations it monitors. In a statement released to
journalists, the organization said it has recorded 630 356 cases so
far this year [2007], an 11 percent increase from 2006. Of this
year's [2007] cases, 12 147 were the more severe dengue hemorrhagic
fever (DHF), and 183 cases were fatal.

Jarbas Barbosa da Silva, PAHO's manager of health surveillance and
disease management, said in the press release that all 4 dengue
[virus] serotypes were in circulation [in Latin America], "which
increases the risk for appearance of the most serious forms of the
disease -- namely, dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock
syndrome."

For the 1st time, Paraguay has reported cases of hemorrhagic fever
and deaths from the disease this year [2007], Barbosa da Silva said.
Southernmost Latin American countries have accounted for 60 percent
of the region's dengue cases, with Brazil reporting the most, the
PAHO report said. The Andean region has had 19 percent of the cases,
with Colombia and Venezuela reporting the highest numbers. Other
countries reporting high rates are French Guiana, Martinique, Costa
Rica, and Honduras.

PAHO's report says Mexico has reported 67 563 dengue cases, of which
5212 involved hemorrhagic fever. Health officials in Nuevo Laredo,
Mexico, on the US border, recently reported 71 pending or confirmed
dengue fever cases, according to a 9 Oct [2007] report in the Laredo
Morning Times.

A recent [10 Aug 2007] article in the CDC's (US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention) Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR)
[<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5631a1.htm>] said that
dengue fever is gaining a stronger foothold in southern Texas [in
2005]. The report documented the 1st DHF case in a Texas resident
native to the Texas-Mexico border area and found that 38 percent of
surveyed Brownsville, Texas, residents had IgG antibodies to dengue,
indicating that a substantial proportion of the city population had
been infected with the virus.

Puerto Rico's health department is recording 500 cases a week, with a
cumulative of 6175 cases and 4 deaths this year [2007], according to
a Reuters report. Local press reports in the Dominican Republic say
the country has logged 6000 cases and 30 deaths.

PAHO noted that one contributing factor is waste tires and dumps
filled with discarded plastic that create potential breeding sites
for mosquitoes.

In July [2007], the WHO's Western Pacific regional office in Manila
warned countries in the area that a major dengue outbreak could occur
unless they quickly undertook coordinated efforts to curb the spread
of the disease. The WHO said the disease had arrived earlier than
usual, but it was difficult to estimate the magnitude of the outbreak
because official information from most of the counties was incomplete.

John Ehrenberg, a WHO regional adviser, said several factors were
contributing to the spread of dengue: population explosion,
migration, and rapid urban growth, all of which strain public health
services and access to clean water.

"People exposed to these settings often rely on containers to collect
water for their own drinking supply. These containers can become
mosquito-breeding sites," he said. "Water storage practices are
therefore a key target of dengue prevention and control programs."

[Unfortunately, the PAHO country reports are an underestimate of the
actual numbers of cases. Only 3 countries -- El Salvador, Honduras,
and Nicaragua -- are current in their reporting. Some are more than 8
months behind. Since dengue viruses are not limited by international
borders, it is important that regional reporting of dengue cases,
preferably by dengue virus serotype, be timely and accurate. -
