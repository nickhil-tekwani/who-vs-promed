CYCLOSPORA - GERMANY: IMPORTED (02)
***********************************
Date: Wed, 02 Jul 1997 13:38:35 -0400 (EDT)
From: Darcy E. Hanes <DEH@VAX8.CFSAN.FDA.GOV>
I work for the US Food and Drug Administration. My laboratory is conducting
research on _Cyclospora cayetanensis_ and I am very interested in the import
cases reported in Germany. I am in the process of collecting cyclospora from
any and all sources and would be very interested in obtaining a sample of the
material collected in Germany. I am also interested in any information that
can be provided concerning these cases such as possible source of infection,
[date of] onset of symptoms, etc.
