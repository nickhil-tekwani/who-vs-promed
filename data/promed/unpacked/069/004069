According to Voice of China, hand foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a
common disease in infants and young children; it is a Category C (3?)
notifiable disease in China. It is caused by enteroviruses
[predominantly enterovirus 71 and coxsackievirus A16 - Mod.CP]. The
clinical presentations include fever and vesicular rash of the hand,
foot, and mouth. Some children may have complications such as
myocarditis, pulmonary edema, and aseptic meningitis. To control the
disease, China has stated that when cases of HFMD are found,
officials must report online within 24 hours. However, our reporters
have found that a hospital in Ming-Chuan county is fabricating
patient records to hide the true extent of HFMD.

Recently, our reporter went to the Ming-Chuan County People's
Hospital in Henan Province. The 2nd floor of the in-patient
department seemed extraordinarily crowded. There were more than 60
beds with children aged from a few months to 4-5 years. Some of the
hallways also had hospital beds with patients. Most of these children
came from rural areas. They were diagnosed with encephalitis, upper
respiratory infections, intracranial infections, and gastroenteritis.
But our reporter found the patients all had fever and vesicles on
their hands and feet and in their mouths. These are typical symptoms
of HFMD, but the doctors did not document any of these in the patient records.

Parent 1: "[My child has] vesicles on hands and feet." Reporter: "But
this is not written in your chart." Parent 1: "Who knows? I don't
care as long as my child gets better."

Parent 2: "My uncle is a traditional medicine doctor; I asked my
uncle to look at the child. He said this is typical HFMD, so we came
here. When I asked the doctor (at the hospital) if this is HFMD, he
said this is an infection of the mouth." Reporter: "How did he
explain the vesicles on the hands?" Parent 2: "We came here on the
1st day, when the vesicles in the hands were small, and there were
only one or 2. On the 2nd day, there were a lot more (vesicles). He
(the doctor) didn't say it is (HFMD) disease, but he also didn't tell
us what disease this is." Reporter: "What disease did he write on the
chart?" Parent 2: "He usually only wrote after we left."

Our reporter asked the doctors why none of the vesicles on the
patients were recorded, but none of the 3 doctors answered the
question. Reporter: "I am wondering why you didn't document these
very obvious symptoms?"

[In 2008, an extensive outbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease swept
through Asia, badly affecting mainland China. Enterovirus infections
in general increase in prevalence during the period between spring
and autumn, and hand, foot and mouth disease in children is one of
the major consequences. There are early indications (e.g. diagnosis
of enterovirus 71 infections in Taiwan) of an impending outbreak of
hand, foot and mouth disease on the Chinese mainland. The reluctance
of local physicians to acknowledge the occurrence of cases of hand,
foot and mouth disease may be another indicator of the emergence of a
new epidemic. Further information would be welcomed.
