[The 15 Jul 2014 ProMED-mail post (archive no 20140717.2616015) reported 30 deaths from encephalitis in the North Bengal Medical College Hospital. Now, just a week later, the number of fatal cases has doubled to 60. Not enough information is provided to speculate on the etiological agent that might be involved in this outbreak.

West Bengal state neighbors Bihar state, which has had a significant number of encephalitis cases this year (2014). These cases in West Bengal may or may not be related to those that have been occurring in Bihar state.

Encephalitis with fever could be caused by various viruses, and the start of the monsoon season brings on the Japanese encephalitis virus transmission season. There is no indication in the report above that laboratory tests are being carried out. ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving results of any tests that are being done.
