Notes:
1. A decrease in the number of cumulative cases and discrepancies in the
difference between cumulative number of cases of the last and the current
WHO update is attributed to the discarding of cases.
2. Includes cases who are "discharged" or "recovered" as reported by the
national public health authorities.
3. National public health authorities report to WHO on the areas in which
local chain(s) of transmission is/are occurring. These areas are provided
on the list of Affected Areas.
4. One death attributed to Hong Kong SAR China occurred in a case medically
transferred from Viet Nam.

[C] Update 40 - Situation in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Viet Nam 26 Apr 2003
<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_04_26/en/>
Preliminary findings of the WHO Shanghai team
A WHO team of 6 experts, in Shanghai since Monday [21 Apr 2003], has
provided a preliminary report of its findings. The team was invited by
Shanghai authorities to assess the SARS situation in China's second largest
city.
Among its activities, the team examined the SARS surveillance and reporting
system, investigated rumours that the case burden might be higher than
officially reported, and visited 10 health facilities, 3 district Centres
for Disease Control, and the municipal Centre for Disease Control. The team
was given free access to all requested data, patient registries, and
facilities, which were visited at very short notice.
The team found no evidence of systematic underreporting of cases, and
concluded that the level of preparedness and response was good. Reporting
of cases appeared to be open, frank, and accurate. Over the past 3 to 4
weeks, authorities designated 2 hospitals as dedicated to the treatment of
SARS patients and set up cough and fever clinics. The team also found a
very high level of government commitment to tackle the SARS problem.
Many questions remain about why Shanghai has been spared a SARS outbreak on
the scale of that seen in Beijing. Had a larger number of cases occurred,
it is not certain whether the systems presently in place would have been
able to cope.
Situation in Hong Kong
Health authorities announced 17 new cases, including 3 in health care
workers, and 6 deaths, including the youngest SARS fatality in Hong Kong to
date. This was a previously healthy 28 year old man from the Amoy Gardens
housing estate cluster. The other deaths occurred in men aged 38, 40, 61,
and 70 years, and a 45 year old woman. Only one of these patients, the 70
year old man, had a history of chronic disease. Of the 6 deaths announced
yesterday, 3 were from the Amoy Gardens cluster.
Authorities are continuing to investigate a small cluster of cases in the
Tung Tau housing estate, where 6 cases have occurred in vertically linked
flats. Presently available epidemiological evidence gives no reason to
anticipate an outbreak at the estate on the scale of Amoy Gardens cluster,
which involved more than 320 residents of a single building.
A WHO team of environmental and "sick building" experts arrived in Hong
Kong to assist local experts in the investigation of possible environmental
sources of the virus.
No new cases in Viet Nam for 18 days
The SARS situation in Viet Nam has remained stable, at 63 cases and 5
deaths, for 18 consecutive days. Active investigation of numerous rumours
has failed to detect a new case of SARS throughout this period. If the
trend continues, the country will be removed from the list of affected
areas on Monday, making Viet Nam the first country to contain its SARS
outbreak. WHO officials in Viet Nam cautioned against a lapse in the
present high state of alert, as the risk persists that a single imported
case could seed an outbreak, as happened in February [2003]. However, the
government showed strong commitment at the highest level from the beginning
of the outbreak. Task forces and provincial teams were established and have
worked well. Good procedures of infection control were rapidly established
and eventually proved effective in preventing further spread among hospital
staff.
Should the country experience an imported case, this newly established
infrastructure would most likely be effective in preventing another large
outbreak.
Update on cases and countries
As of today [26 Apr 2003], a cumulative total of 4836 cases with 293 deaths
have occurred in 26 countries. This represents an increase of 190 new cases
and 19 deaths compared with yesterday. The new deaths occurred in Canada
(3), China (7), Hong Kong SAR (6), the Philippines (1), and Singapore (2).

Situation report on atypical pneumonia 26 Apr 2003
--------------------------------------------------
The following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the
Hospital Authority:
As of 1 PM 26 Apr 2003, there are an additional 17 patients confirmed to
have atypical pneumonia following admission to public hospitals earlier.
They include 3 health care workers (one from Caritas Medical Centre, one
from Tai Po Hospital, and one from Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital).
The remaining 14 are other patients and contacts of patients with atypical
pneumonia.
A total of 632 patients have recovered from atypical pneumonia and have
been discharged from public hospitals. Of them, 18 were discharged today.
There are also 129 recovering patients who are in convalescence and
preparation for discharge. 101 patients are receiving treatment in
intensive care units.
6 patients died in Caritas Medical Centre (CMC), Princess Margaret Hospital
(PMH), Tuen Mun Hospital (TMH), and United Christian Hospital (UCH). This
brought to 121 the total number of deaths relating to atypical pneumonia.
The deceased are aged from 28 to 70 and include one woman and 5 men. [4
were otherwise healthy individuals under the age of 50 years - Mod.MPP]
The cumulative figure for patients who have been admitted to public
hospitals with atypical pneumonia since 12 Mar 2003 is as follows:
Cumulative no. cases / total no. discharged patients / total no. deaths*
Health care workers of hospitals/clinics and medical students: 345 / 140 / ?
Patients, family members & visitors: 1182 / 492 / ?
Total: 1527 ** / 632 / 121
Suspected cases: 26
* Most of the deaths occurred in individuals who have a history of chronic
diseases, or were patients who sought treatment at a relatively late stage
of infection.
** There are 129 recovering patients in convalescence.

Update 39 - SARS 25 Apr 2003 6:00 PM
------------------------------------
As of 25 Apr 2003, Health Canada has received reports of 341 probable or
suspect cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Canada. There
have been 18 deaths in Canada. To date, transmission has been limited to
specific transmission settings such as households, hospitals and specific
community settings. The information contained in this update is based on
the information available to Health Canada at this time.
The details of the cases to date are as follows:
Ontario is reporting 138 probable and 127 suspect cases.
British Columbia is reporting 4 probable and 60 suspect cases.
New Brunswick is reporting 2 suspect cases.
Saskatchewan is reporting 1 suspect case.
Alberta is reporting 5 suspect cases.
Prince Edward Island is reporting 4 suspect cases.
Total no. of probables discharged: 75
Total no. of probables recovering at home: 2
Total no. of suspects discharged: 85
Total no. of suspects recovering at home: 69
These numbers are accurate as of 1:00 PM EDST 25 Apr 2003.
[The most recent epidemiological analysis of reported SARS cases in Canada
is available through 24 Apr 2003 and can be accessed at:
<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/pphb-dgspsp/sars-sras/eu-ae/sars20030424_e.html>.
In the epidemic curve presented in that update, the date of onset of the
most recent case reported is 14 Apr 2003, or 12 days ago. The additional
reports of new cases may not reflect cases with more recent dates of onset,
but rather may reflect later identification of cases. Readers are reminded
that the case definition for probable case of SARS is one of exclusion, so
that other causes of a severe acute respiratory illness with an atypical
pneumonia may be ruled out by physicians before a case is reported as a
suspect or probable case. (see
<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/pphb-dgspsp/sars-sras/sarscasedef-0317_e.html> for
the case definitions used in Canada). - Mod.MPP]

[A] India from PTI 26 Apr 2003 19:07 IST
<http://www.ptinews.com/nextstory.asp?main=Indian&ID=973&rec=none>
With 3 more people testing positive for the SARS virus in the country, the
number of such cases has gone up to 7, health ministry officials said here
today. Of the 3 freshly confirmed cases, one is being treated in Kasturba
Hospital, Mumbai and the other two in Apollo Hospital, Kolkata and Naidu
Hospital, Pune, the officials added.
[B] Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia from NY Times / AP 26 Apr 2003 11:32 AM ET
<http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/health/AP-SARS-Virus.html>
Health ministers from across east Asia came up with a joint plan to fight
SARS during a meeting here Saturday [26 Apr 2003].
The Asian health ministers approved a plan to boost screening at
international departure points, bar travelers with SARS symptoms, and
require health declaration forms for visitors from affected countries. "We
must use every weapon at our disposal," the regional director of WHO,
Shigeru Omi, told the health ministers and senior officials from South East
Asia, China, Hong Kong, Japan, and South Korea.
Omi said Saturday's meeting and a summit next week of South East Asian
leaders in Thailand could "determine the future course" of how nations
tackle SARS. "The threat posed by SARS is unprecedented," Omi said. "The
virus has already demonstrated its explosive power to cause sudden
outbreaks in a large number of countries. Tourism has almost disappeared,
normal life has been seriously disrupted."
[C] Azerbiajan from Reuter's UK 26 Apr 2003 16:44:09 GMT
<http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L26476506.htm>
5 people in Azerbaijan, including one just returned from China, are
undergoing observation in hospital with suspected cases of SARS, a source
in the Health Ministry said.
"Those taken to hospital in Baku have symptoms similar to those of SARS,"
the source told Reuters in the capital of the ex-Soviet state on the
Caspian Sea. "They have been isolated in separate rooms and are undergoing
tests and examinations. Clinical diagnosis can be confirmed in 2 or 3
days." The source said one of the patients suspected of suffering from SARS
had been working in China and returned to Azerbaijan last week, travelling
through Turkey. But state television showed a hospital doctor telling the
young man's relatives that he was only suffering from a cold. No details of
other patients were available.

SARS in suspected cases & well people
-----------------------------------
With the possible SARS coronavirus detected by the Canadian National
Microbiology Laboratory in well people and in people only meeting the
"suspected case" definition, the most important immediate question to ask
is, have there been any "probable" cases who had direct contact only with
suspected case(s), or contact with well people who had been exposed? I
would also be interested in knowing which tests were used in the Canadian
study and which in Hong Kong, where 90 per cent of probable cases tested
positive. I did not see in the ProMED-mail reports whether these tests
involved acute and convalescent sera, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or
other type of viral analysis.

[These are legitimate questions for which we do not have specific answers
as yet. The reports on the testing conducted in the various countries
include results of PCR testing and antibody tests, but we do not have the
specifics of the data in Canada. Our current understanding is that, in the
case of Canada and Singapore, the overwhelming majority of reported cases
can be linked back to contact with other probable cases. There are a few
cases in Canada for whom the location of transmission has not been
identified as yet. These limited data support the currently held impression
that close contact with known SARS cases continues to be the primary route
of transmission. When good reliable diagnostic tests are available to
confirm infection with the SARS related virus, we will be able to identify
what proportion of "suspected" cases are due to SARS, and what proportion
of SARS infected individuals have minimal or no clinical illness associated
with their infections. - Mod.MPP]

ProMED-mail
<promed@promedmail.org>
[As of 26 Apr 2003, the worldwide cumulative total is 4836 cases with 293
deaths, reported from 26 countries. In the 24 hours since the last update,
190 new cases and 19 deaths have been reported. 154 of the newly reported
cases are from China, 17 from Hong Kong, 8 from Taiwan, 3 from Singapore,
and 2 each from Canada, Mongolia, the Philippines, and the USA.
With respect to the news brief from India, other newswire reports mention
that one of these cases is related to the imported case, who was attending
a wedding in Pune. The newswire reports all stress that these are confirmed
cases based on laboratory testing. As the number of cases of SARS reported
from India to WHO continues to be "one", we are curious where this
information is coming from, as the newswires do mention health ministry
officials in their announcements. It should be noted that the last report
on SARS from India to WHO was on 21 Apr 2003, and these additional cases
have been reported by the press since that date.
We have stressed in prior postings the need to maintain consistent clinical
and epidemiological criteria for case reporting, pending more information
on the sensitivity and specificity of currently available laboratory tests.
It is unclear whether these additional cases mentioned in the newswires fit
the case definition or are based on "laboratory confirmation", as the
newswire suggests. Clarification of this issue is of concern, as
introduction of local transmission of SARS within densely populated India
would be of significant import with regard to the containment of SARS. -
