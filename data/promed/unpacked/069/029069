[1] France: mask restrictions

https://www.france24.com/en/france/20220312-too-soon-covid-cases-on-the-rise-as- france-prepares-to-lift-restrictions


The latest upturn in infections is cause for concern as France prepares to lift most COVID-19 restrictions on [Mon 14 Mar 2022], with some health workers lamenting a premature move dictated by political imperatives ahead of the country's presidential election.

Crowded out by the war in Ukraine and France's looming presidential contest, COVID-19 has all but vanished from the French news in recent weeks. And yet the pandemic that brought the world to a standstill in 2020 is far from over.

In fact, after weeks of steady decline, COVID-19 infections are creeping up again, according to the public health body, Santé publique France. The number of new infections topped 73 000 on [Fri 11 Mar 2022], up from 60 000 a week before. The more accurate 7-day average pointed to almost 70 000 new cases per day - a 20% increase week-on-week.

The national average conceals significant regional disparities, says Guillaume Rozier, founder of the government-sponsored website COVIDTracker, establishing a link between the uptick in cases and French regions' staggered return to school after the winter holidays.

"The rise in cases is most apparent in northern France and along the Mediterranean coast, roughly corresponding to the areas where children returned to school earliest (on [21 Feb 2022])," he explained.

The schools' rentrée is known to drive infections as pupils, teachers and parents mingle after the Winter break. Health experts have also flagged a slackening of social distancing measures as people lower their guard.

Another potential infection driver is the spread of omicron's BA.2 subvariant, which early studies suggest could be up to 30% more infectious than the strain that was prevalent so far.

Off with their masks
--------------------
France is not alone in registering an uptick in cases, with Germany, Britain and the Netherlands reporting similar trends. However, like its European peers, the French government is determined to stick to its timetable to lift restrictions.

Rules requiring people to show a COVID-19 vaccine passport to access venues will be lifted on [Mon 14 Mar 2022], just under a month before the country's presidential election. So will the requirement to wear face masks indoors.

Henceforth, the face coverings that have become a symbol of the pandemic will be required only on public transport, in hospitals and in care homes for the elderly - marking a major policy shift that some experts and health workers have described as premature.

"France's health minister had said the move would be conditional on a number of health indicators. But it seems that sticking to the timetable is now the priority," said the Swiss-based epidemiologist Antoine Flahaut, referring to Health Minister Olivier Véran's claim that restrictions would only be lifted if the incidence rate - the number of new cases per 100 000 people - stayed below 500 (it is now at 546).

The government is also short of its target of bringing the number of patients in ICU below 1500. The number has only recently slipped below the 2000-mark, its lowest level since early December [2021].

Politics trumping health concerns
---------------------------------
According to Jérome Marty, who heads the doctors' union UFML, the decision to lift restrictions is both untimely and misguided, driven by political imperatives.

"It wouldn't have bothered me if infections were falling, but clearly it's not the case. Moreover, we're dropping face masks without implementing any parallel measures to ventilate closed spaces and prevent viral concentrations," he told FRANCE 24. "With the presidential campaign in full swing, the motive is clearly political, not sanitary."

The fear is that hospitalisations could also start edging up again, as is already the case in the UK, though France's high vaccination rate and the arrival of spring should help ease the pressure on hospitals.

"The public can count on better vaccine protection and greater knowledge of the virus than in the past," said Marty. "The problem is that we still have 5 million people who are not vaccinated and some 300 000 who are immunocompromised."

Overcoming vaccine scepticism in the Caribbean
----------------------------------------------
Health workers are particularly concerned about the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe, where the number of new cases has once again crossed the alert threshold.

So far, only 45% of Guadeloupeans have received a first vaccine jab. Less than a quarter of the population has completed its vaccination with 3 doses. Local officials are hoping to overcome widespread vaccine scepticism with the introduction of the Novavax jab, a more traditional vaccine compared with the messenger RNA types used so far.

Announcing the territory's 1000th hospital death from COVID-19 in late [February 2022], local health workers lamented a "carnage without precedent since Guadeloupe's cholera epidemic of 1865-6".

As the head of the World Health Organisation, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, warned on [Wed 9 Mar 2022], "this pandemic is far from over".

[2] Deltacron recombinant
Date: Sat 12 Mar 2022

https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2022/03/12/new-deltacron-covid-19-coronavirus-variant-is-a-recombinant-of-delta-and-omicron/?sh=fb2e64d1d730


The deltacron name [for a new variant] first emerged in early January 2022. As Lisa Kim reported for Forbes back then, Leondios Kostrikis, professor of biological sciences at the University of Cyprus, and his team indicated that they had discovered a new version of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that combined characteristics of the delta and omicron variants. They had detected this version in samples taken from 25 patients with COVID-19 in Cyprus, 11 of whom were hospitalized at the time. The research team dubbed this new version the "deltacron" variant, as a combination of the words "delta" and "omicron".

Fast forward a couple months and there is now "solid evidence for a delta-omicron recombinant virus." That's what GISAID said, based on findings shared by a team from the Institut Pasteur in France. GISAID stands for the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data. Established in 2008, GISAID is a worldwide collaborative platform that allows scientists across the world to openly share genomic data originally for influenza viruses but now also for COVID-19 coronaviruses.

This new "deltacron" recombinant includes structures from both the delta GK/AY.4 and omicron GRA/BA.1 lineages.

As Jeremy Kamil, PhD, an Associate Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Louisiana State University (LSU) Health Shreveport, tweeted on [8 Mar 2022], this new recombinant has been circulating since early January 2022 and detected in several regions of France by the Institut Pasteur team.

Similar "recombined" versions of the virus have also appeared in Denmark, which was the first country in the European Union to lift COVID-19 restrictions nationwide in early February [2022], and the Netherlands.

There's probably already been a fair number of people infected with both the delta and the omicron variants simultaneously, since both variants have spread in relatively uncontrolled manners throughout the U.S. and Europe. Therefore, the emergence of such a recombinant should not be a surprise, as Maria Van Kerkhove, PhD, who's the World Health Organization's (WHO's) technical lead for the COVID-19 response, tweeted.

Whenever a new version of the SARS-CoV-2 emerges, the big question is whether it's more transmissible (i.e., spreads more easily) than previous versions. And whether it's more likely to cause more severe COVID-19. OK, the 2 biggest questions are whether it's more transmissible and more likely to cause more severe COVID-19. And whether it's more adept at evading existing immune protection from vaccination or previous natural infection. Yes, these are the 3 biggest questions along with whether it doesn't respond as well to treatments such as intravenous antibodies or antivirals. OK, maybe there are 4 big questions. Regardless, so far, there have been too few reported cases of "deltacron" variant infections to answer any of these questions. It would take many more cases to establish any statistically significant trends.

For now, this "deltacron" variant hasn't risen to the level of being either a "variant of interest" or a "variant of concern," as defined by the WHO. It does, however, bear close watching and following.

[3] SARSCoV-2 virus evolution
Date: Mon 14 Mar 2022
Source: Nature [abridged, edited]
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-022-00722-z#citeas


[Citation. Markov PV, Katzourakis A, and Stilianakis NI. Antigenic evolution will lead to new SARS-CoV-2 variants with unpredictable severity. Nat Rev Microbiol (2022). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41579-022-00722-z]

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) is set for continuous circulation in humans owing to its ease of transmission, waning immunity, antigenic evolution and an array of potential animal reservoirs (1). A key question is predicting the epidemiological and clinical parameters of this continuous circulation (2) and the future population burden of COVID-19.

The comparatively milder levels of disease produced by omicron, the most recent variant of concern (VOC), in relation to previous VOCs rekindled a variety of wishful narratives about the epidemiology and evolution of the virus. These ideas range from misconceived and premature theories about 'harmless' endemicity (3) , to expectations that widespread immunity renders epidemic waves safe and to hopes that the virus will evolve to be benign.

Another common belief banks on widespread vaccine or infection-induced immunity to guarantee mild SARS-CoV-2 infections in the future. This idea, however, ignores a central feature of SARS-CoV-2 biology -- antigenic evolution, that is, an ongoing modification of the viral antigenic profile in response to host immune pressures. High rates of antigenic evolution can result in immune escape, that is, reduced capacity of the immune system to prevent reinfection and potentially severe disease thereupon. On a population level, antigenic evolution and escape can increase burden through increasing the rates of reinfections and rates of severe illness (Fig. 1). Omicron demonstrated clearly that SARS-CoV-2 is capable of considerable antigenic escape over a relatively short period of time.

To understand the future burden of COVID-19, besides exploring the relationship between antigenic escape and disease severity, we need to scrutinize the mechanisms generating highly antigenically divergent variants and the circumstances underlying their emergence. This includes studying patterns of antigenic evolution in immunodeficient individuals or in SARS-CoV-2-permissive animal species at human proximity. Understanding these factors will enable us to more reliably evaluate the future population risk of disease in humans and to plan and prepare.

[4] US: prisons
Date: Mon 14 Mar 2022

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/03/covid-19-us-prisoners-staff-triple-community-rate


A study of COVID-19 rates among inmates and staff at 101 US federal prisons compared with surrounding counties from [May 2020] through [January 2021] finds 3-times-higher infection rates in prisons. [Towers S, Wallace D, Walker J, et al. A study of SARS-COV-2 outbreaks in US federal prisons: the linkage between staff, incarcerated populations, and community transmission. BMC Public Health 22, 482 (2022). https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-12813-w]

German and US researchers conducted the study, published late last week in BMC Public Health, using data from the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center from [18 May 2020 - 31 Jan 2021]. The study period did not span the emergence and dominance of the highly transmissible delta and omicron SARS-CoV-2 variants, but it did cover a period of prison lockdowns in which no visitors were admitted.

The study also assessed the effects of decarceration (release of prisoners) on COVID-19 rates among inmates, staff, and the community. Decarceration involves reforms such as release to home confinement to decrease prison crowding and quell virus spread.

The study authors cautioned that COVID-19 data for prisoners and staff differ from those for the community, with the former representing the time series of infected inmates and staff who tested positive and were still positive (prevalence), plus the time series count of previously infected prisoners and staff and those who have recovered or died, while the latter is the number of confirmed cases per day (incidence).

Link with prison security level early in pandemic
-------------------------------------------------
Per capita COVID-19 rates were significantly higher among prisoners than in staff and the community and were significantly linked with prison security level early in the pandemic, ranked from lowest rate to highest: High, minimum, medium, and low security.

"It is unclear why this is the case, but it may be because all incarcerated individuals in federal Minimum security prisons work, whereas this is not true of the higher security prisons, and greater opportunity for group close-contact social activities in non-working prisons (particularly Low security prisons) perhaps may account for the disparities in transmission," the researchers wrote.

"The fact that later in the pandemic we found no significant relationship of incarcerated per capita rates to security level may indicate that by that point in the pandemic prisons might have established better social distancing protocols and/or more consistent use of PPE [personal protective equipment] that reduced differences in transmission in the different types of prison settings," they added.

Over the study period, 7 prisons accounted for over 50% of all cases in prisoners and staff. All surrounding counties reported at least one COVID-19 case over the study period, while 8 prisons had no cases among inmates, and 16 had no cases in in the first pandemic wave. During this wave, 3 prisons accounted for over 50% of cases among all inmates, and 9 prisons accounted for over 50% of staff infections.

Toward the end of the study (the 2nd wave), 0 and 7 prisons reported no cases among prisoners and staff, respectively. During this period, 13 prisons accounted for over 50% of cases among prisoners, and 15 accounted for over 50% of staff cases.

Staff COVID-19 rates were significantly related to only community rates during the 1st pandemic summer and overall, and they were related only to state rates in the next wave. Rates among inmates were significantly related to only community rates overall and during the later part of the study period and were significantly related to only prison security level and community COVID-19 rates in the summer.

Decarceration tied to lower inmate infections
---------------------------------------------
Officials decarcerated an average of 4% of prisoners over the study period. Decarceration significantly decreased the COVID-19 rate among prisoners during the 2nd surge, with no significant effect on infection rates among staff or community during either surge, the authors said.

"These studies can help inform infectious disease response policies in prisons that help to potentially mitigate rates of infection in incarcerated populations, staff, and the community at large," the study authors wrote.

The researchers noted that prisons have been the sites of some of the worst COVID-19 outbreaks, with 1 in 4 inmates testing positive, COVID-19 rates that were 3 -- 6 times higher than the US public, and more than 2400 deaths.

"For some time, prisons have been known facilitators of the spread of infectious diseases through multiple pathways, including the architectural structure of shared space by those incarcerated (i.e., dining areas and living spaces), mass incarceration and subsequent over-crowding, and the social interactions in the prison," they wrote.

But prisoners are not the only transmitters of infectious disease, the authors said. "Prisons are not closed systems, and while the incarcerated individuals have little contact with the outside world, correctional staff members move in and out of the prison to the community daily," they wrote. "As such, prison staff can not only potentially bring SARS-COV-2 into the prison and facilitate spread in that environment as they move about during their workday, but also spread SARS-COV-2 to their local communities."

The researchers called for a holistic approach to COVID-19 infection control in prisons and surrounding counties that considers the complex interplay of dynamics among inmate, staff, and community transmission.

"We found significant evidence of community/staff/incarcerated population inter-linkage of SARS-COV-2 transmission," the researchers wrote. "Further study is warranted to determine which control measures aimed at the incarcerated population and/or staff are most efficacious at preventing or controlling outbreaks."

[The inclusion of an examination of the impact of decarceration is important since this is one approach to control virus spread in crowded prisons. This control measure did "not appear to have significantly negatively impacted SARS-COV-2 transmission in the surrounding community." This is an important finding. It is not clear what is the recommended number of incarcerated individuals per set space before rapid spread of the virus is facilitated in prisons and other institutional settings. Some of this will depend on practices in the prison, for example, how much intermingling takes place, personal protective practices, and more. - Mod.LK]

- The Americas region reported 6% of cases and 23.7% of deaths in the past 24 hours having reported more than 148.99 million cases, 2nd to the European region, as the most severely affected region. Brazil reported 45 020 cases followed by Chile. An additional 5 countries reported more than 1000 cases (Peru, Argentina, Mexico, Guatemala, and Uruguay) in the past 24 hours. Additionally, Cuba and Colombia reported more than 500 but fewer than 1000 cases. The USA, Canada, Ecuador and Cost Rica among others did not report any cases in the last 24 hours.

- The European region reported 33.9% of cases and 32.3% of deaths over the last 24 hours, as the most effected region, with cumulative cases exceeding 188.23 million. Some countries reporting few or no cases in the last 24 hours or longer include the UK, Spain, Belgium, Switzerland, and Tajikistan, among others. A total of 32 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours, no country reporting more than 100 000 cases, 8 reporting more than 10 000, 19 reporting over 1000 cases, and 5 countries reported more than 500 but fewer than 1000 cases.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 2.6% of daily case numbers and 6.7% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 21.44 million cases. Jordan (25 502) reported the highest number of cases over the last 24 hours followed by Iran, and Bahrain. Pakistan reported more than 500 but less than 1000 cases over the last 24 hours. Egypt, Sudan and Kuwait, among others did not report any cases over the last 24 hours.

- The African region reported 0.11% of daily cases and 0.57% of total deaths during the past 24 hours having reported a cumulative total of more than 8.48 million cases. South Africa (972) reported the highest number of cases over the last 24 hours followed by Zimbabwe, with the rest of countries reporting below 100 or 50 cases . A total of 23 countries did not report any cases over the last 24 hours. The low reported numbers may not be a true reflection of the prevalent COVID19 situation in the region as vaccine coverage remains low.

- The Western Pacific region reported 54.2% of daily case numbers and 26.5% deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 33.12 million cases. South Korea (309 790) reported the highest number of cases over the last 24 hours followed by Vietnam, Japan, Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand, China, Singapore, Brunei, Solomon Islands and Philippines.

- The South East Asia region reported 2.8% of the daily newly reported cases and 10.1% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 56.50 million cases. Thailand (22 130) reported the highest number of cases followed by Indonesia (9629), India (2503), Bhutan (1032), and Bangladesh (239).

A global total of 1617 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 12 Mar 2022 to late 13 Mar 2022).

A total of 55 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 31 of the 55 countries are from the European region, 9 are from the Americas region, 3 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 8 are from the Western Pacific region, 3 from the South East Asia region, and 1 are from the African region. There has been an overall increase in the global trends for cases, with a decreasing trend in deaths.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 9.4%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 22.8%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 52.3% decrease in daily reported cases and a 28.9% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 1.66 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 460.18 million cumulative reported cases and over 6.06 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
