EXANTHEM (ILLNESS WITH RASH) - BELGIUM/BOSNIA
=============================================
During the Deployment to Bosnia we encountered an outbreak that might be of
interest.
An engineering unit of approximately 150 persons came to Europe in preparation
for further movement to Bosnia. They worked in Belgium starting 22 December
for about a week and then boarded a train on 27 December for Hungary. When the
train arrived at the Austrian border it was stopped because there were six
cases of suspected measles. By the time the train got to the staging area in
Hungary on 31 December there were 21 cases. Three more cases were identified
on 1 and 2 January and a final case on the third. The patients presented with
a rash, low grade fever, sore throat, and upper respiratory symptoms. The
macular rash (which had been mistaken for measles) quickly spread and in some
cases covered much of the body. The rash was described as itching, and in some
cases painful. In some cases the rash included the soles and palms. The rash
lasted several days.
Subsequently, two more engineer units have come down with the same illness. 27
cases have been identified in one unit, and 10 cases in the third unit The
patients were not very ill and many were able to continue to work.
Interestingly both of these units had staged in the same area in Belgium.
There was also a small unit of 10 persons working in Belgium at the rail site
where all of these units loaded their equipment. 5 of these individuals became
ill at the same time as the first unit. We are not aware of cases in the
local population. The common element is in Belgium, but there is no obvious
common exposure although all of the persons involved did stay at one (very
large) hotel.
The most likely thing would be a viral exanthem, probably spread person to
person. We have considered toxic exposures, allergies, etc., but with the
putative incubation period of 5 days that seems unlikely.
There are a number of interesting aspects to the illness: It is presumably
infectious. It has a high attack rate, but there do not appear to be any
secondary cases. So what we are seeing is an infectious disease, with
approximately a 5 day incubation period, symptoms of low grade fever, upper
respiratory symptoms, and a prominent rash. Is it possible that passage in
humans changes the virus so that there are no secondary cases? It has been
suggested that this might be Parvovirus or coxsackie , other possibilities
include echovirus, adenovirus or some other less likely things. Acute and
convalescent sera have been collected as well as specimens for attempts at
virus isolation. Not sure how successful that will be.
Of further interest, in 1990 we had a similar outbreak in a unit that had come
from the States for the REFORGER exercises. They also staged in Belgium.
Any ideas??
