Chinook Health recently announced the 1st case of hantavirus [disease] has
been confirmed in this region, although since 1989, 28 cases throughout
Alberta have been reported.

In a press release issued by Chinook Health, Dr Vanessa Maclean, acting
medical officer of health, says given the largely rural population, the
potential for someone to contract the virus is always a possibility.
Maclean adds the individual has since recovered, but the public needs to
remain cautious, as the virus can be aggressive and has a fatality rate of
30 per cent.

Contracted primarily when an individual inhales rodent urine and feces,
Chinook Health says it's important to not disturb contaminated dry
materials. "Any time people are working in areas inhabited by mice they
need to be extra cautious," says Maclean. The affected individual
contracted the virus when cleaning out a barn.

Chinook Health says the most effective precaution against infection is to
keep rodents out of homes and work areas.

Chinook Health states those exposed to the virus usually exhibit symptoms
of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome 1-3 weeks after coming into contact with
contaminated droppings. Dr Maclean says the symptoms initially appear
flu-like and progress quickly. "Within a 72 hour period, a previously
healthy person may require hospitalization and quite often aggressive
management in an ICU setting," says Maclean.

The only confirmed carrier of the hantavirus in Alberta is the deer mouse,
but Chinook Health says all rodents should be treated as potential carriers
[Hantaviruses tend to be fairly host species and genera specific. - Mod.TY]

Chinook Health notes there is no evidence of person-to-person spread of the
virus in North America.

[There is no indication in this report of which hantavirus is involved in
this case. Both Sin Nombre and New York hantaviruses have deer mice as
reservoir hosts. A USA CDC site, with extensive information about
hantaviruses, including those in North America, clinical signs, treatment,
epidemiology, and an image of the deer mouse, _Peromyscus maniculatus_, can
be accessed at <http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/hanta/hps/>. The deer
mouse is one of the most common and widely distributed mammals in North
America. A map showing its distribution can be accessed at
