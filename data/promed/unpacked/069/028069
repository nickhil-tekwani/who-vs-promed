I recall only a few (2?) years ago, 4 people died in Canada of this bug,
because they were infected after handling cultured _Tilapia_ coming from
the States. I remember at least two of these persons were elderly. That
could make the difference with the case, which Erin Bromage described, as
elderly may have a less active responding immune system. All these 4
persons were probably infected through wounds at their hands during
preparation of the fish, not from eating it. I recall the fish was bought
on a local market.
I still remember this case, as a discussion was started whether
_Streptococcus iniae_ could be a novel emerging zoonotic disease related to
aquaculture. As I read these latest ProMED messages, I wondered if we
indeed should not pay more attention to where it is coming from, where it
sticks and hides itself and what can we do about it, before it "conquers"
the world?
At this moment, I am not able to trace the source of this information yet.
I am not a microbiologist or physician, so only followed the discussion at
that time from a distance as I have a special interest for aquaculture.
