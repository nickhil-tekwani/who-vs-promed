Hong Kong health officials urged the public to maintain strict personal and environmental hygiene as local activity of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) and enterovirus (EV) 71 infection has been increasing in the past 2 weeks.

According to the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health, the number of institutional HFMD outbreaks recorded increased from 5 (affecting 23 persons) to 14 (affecting 60 persons) from the week of 6-13 May 2018. As of 24 May 2018, 15 outbreaks involving 59 persons had been reported this week. In the last 4 weeks, most outbreaks occurred in kindergartens and child care centres as well as primary schools.

As for EV71 infection, while only one case of infection was recorded per month in February and March this year [2018], the number of cases increased to 7 in May 2018, bringing the total to 9 cases this year [2018].

"HFMD occurs throughout the year. Apart from a summer peak from May to July, a smaller peak may also occur from October to December. As young children are more susceptible, parents should stay alert to their health. Institutional outbreaks may occur where HFMD can easily spread among young children with close contact," a spokesman for the CHP said.

"We have issued letters to doctors, child care centres, kindergartens and primary and secondary schools to alert them to the latest situation. Schools are reminded to follow the Guidelines on Prevention of Communicable Diseases on preventive and control measures as well as management of outbreaks, which should be reported to the CHP for prompt follow-up," the spokesman added.

HFMD is typically a benign and self-limiting disease. Most common in young children, it presents as fever, oral lesions and rash on the hands, feet and buttocks. The oral lesions consist of rapidly-ulcerating vesicles on the buccal mucosa, tongue, palate and gums. The rash consists of papulovesicular lesions on the palms, fingers and soles, which generally persist for 7-10 days, and maculopapular lesions on the buttocks.

Hand, foot, and mouth disease is caused by viruses that belong to the Enterovirus genus (group). This group of viruses includes polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and enteroviruses. EV-71 has been implicated in HFMD outbreaks in Southeast Asia over the past several years. EV 71 is a non-polio enterovirus.

Complications associated with HFMD caused by the more pathogenic EV-71 strain include encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis, pulmonary edema or hemorrhage, and myocarditis. Most deaths in HFMD occur as a result of pulmonary edema or hemorrhage.

[Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common infectious disease of infants and children. It is characterized by fever, painful sores in the mouth, and a rash with blisters on hands, feet and also buttocks.

EV71 is one of the pathogens associated with hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD). It was responsible for large HFMD outbreaks in Taiwan (1.5 million cases) and Malaysia (Sarawak, 2628 cases) in the late 1990s. In 2008 and 2011 large outbreaks were also described in China (490 000 cases) and Viet Nam (110 000 cases) http://www.wpro.who.int/emerging_diseases/HFMD/en/index.html

Most people with HFMD recover fully after the acute illness. HFMD is usually a mild disease, and nearly all patients recover in 7 to 10 days without medical treatment, and complications are uncommon. Dehydration is the most common complication of HFMD infection caused by coxsackieviruses; it can occur if intake of liquids is limited due to painful sores in the mouth. Rarely, patients develop "aseptic" or viral meningitis, in which the person has fever, headache, stiff neck, or back pain, and may need to be hospitalized for a few days.

HFMD caused by EV71 has been associated with meningitis and encephalitis, and on occasion can cause severe complications, including neurological, cardiovascular, and respiratory problems. Cases of fatal EV71 encephalitis have occurred during outbreaks [http://www.wpro.who.int/emerging_diseases/hfmd.information.sheet/en/].

Interventions are tailored to the severity of the disease and consist of antipyretics, sedatives, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), milrinone, haemofiltration and, occasionally, provision of respiratory support.

Outbreak control measures are targeted at interrupting virus transmission from person to person, as well as through contact with contaminated surfaces (such as toys) or fomites. Therefore, health education messages focus on personal hygiene and good sanitation, including recommendations for frequent hand washing, proper disposal of soiled diapers and regular disinfection of soiled surfaces. The transmission of EVs is most efficient in crowded settings, and, therefore, during outbreaks, most countries in the region have adopted social distancing measures, such as closures of childcare facilities and schools and cancellation of public functions involving children https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4033151/. However, the optimal timing for implementation of these measures is unclear, whether early, as soon as an HFMD case is reported, or later following confirmation of EV71 as the causative agent. In addition, the effectiveness of distancing measures, which have substantial socioeconomic implications, is uncertain. - Mod.UBA
