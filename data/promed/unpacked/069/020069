Snail fever on the rise in Davao del Sur
----------------------------------------
The number of Davao del Sur residents positively afflicted by
schistosomiasis [bilharzia] has risen to an alarming level and if not
immediately checked could lead to an outbreak throughout the province, it
was learned from government health officials.
Schistosomiasis, also known as bilharziasis or snail fever, is a tropical
disease caused by the parasitic worm schistosoma that grows and develops
within certain types of fresh water snails.
Davao health authorities cited constant flooding and poor sanitation as the
2 major reasons for the spread of the parasite. Dr Myla Baluran, team
leader of the DOH Schistosomiasis monitoring group, said 222 children and
adults have sought medical assistance.
Three barangays of Digos- Igpit, Colorado, and Matti - accounted for 179
patients, and the balance from 6 barangays of Hagonoy town-Ribuaya,
Bulatakay, Sacub, San Guillermo, San Isidro, and Sinawayah.
The provincial health office has formed a spray team tasked to destroy all
breeding centers of the parasite such as canals and creeks near the Igpit
and Matti.
It also launched with the DOH an intensive information campaign to promote
proper sanitation.

[Davao is located on the eastern part of Mindanao, the southernmost of the
large Philippine islands. Schistosomiasis seldom occurs in outbreaks unless
snails invade areas previously free of snails, or populations previously
not exposed move into areas with risk. The intermediate snail host can be
introduced into new areas when dams or irrigation systems are built or when
maintenance of existing systems deteriorates. In principle, the infection
can be controlled by controlling the intermediate snail host. We have no
information on the epidemiological background of the report, so any guess
on the cause remains speculative. - Mod.EP]
