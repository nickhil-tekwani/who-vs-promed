South Korea: Positive Laboratory Tests to be Considered as SARS Confirmation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Advisory Committee on SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) at
the National Institute of Health said that it will classify people
here that have tested positive for the SARS coronavirus (thought to
cause the disease) as having contracted the disease. The committee
said, however, that it is still discussing with other government
bodies [how to deal with] reclassified persons. It refused to release
the number of people here that it now regards as having contracted
SARS. The virus testing was conducted using a technique that is
regarded by many experts as only a first step in coming up with a
reliable test for the disease.
"Even though these patients do not show signs of pneumonia, which the
World Health Organization has set as the most important criterion in
diagnosis of the disease", a committee member said, "we decided that
persons exposed to the virus would be regarded as SARS-infected."
Another member of the committee said the number of cases regarded as
confirmed would probably rise when more recently developed test kits,
regarded as more reliable, arrive and are put into use.
At a separate meeting yesterday, the government changed its
regulations under the quarantine law to force arriving passengers who
have symptoms into a 10-day quarantine. Earlier, officials said they
would ask the legislature to change the law to allow such forced
quarantine on all persons suspected or confirmed as having the
disease.
Prime Minister Goh Kun said military medical staff will be dispatched
to 4 quarantine offices. In addition to an isolation unit to be set
up on Youngjong island near Incheon International Airport, 2 more
facilities to isolate passengers who have symptoms of SARS would be
established in areas near Gimhae airport and Jeju airport, he added.
Seoul will also allocate an additional 6 billion won (USD 5 million)
to fight the disease.
One more SARS suspect was reported yesterday, bringing the total to
13 in Korea. A woman in her 20s, who traveled to Beijing recently,
developed symptoms consistent with the disease and checked into a
hospital.

[It is not entirely clear which of the available laboratory tests
(antigen detection or RT-PCR amplification of viral RNA sequences) is
referred to in this report. In the case of RT-PCR based molecular
tests, the WHO recommends the following: Laboratories performing
SARS-specific PCR tests should adopt strict criteria for confirmation
of positive results, especially in low-prevalence areas, where the
positive predictive value might be lower.
The RT-PCR procedure should include appropriate negative and positive
controls in each run, which should yield the expected results:
(a) a negative control for the extraction procedure and a water
control for the PCR run;
(b) a positive control for extraction and PCR;
(c) an inhibition control -- the patient sample spiked with a weak
positive control to detect PCR inhibitory substances.
If a positive PCR result has been obtained, it should be confirmed by:
(a) Repeating the PCR starting from the original sample; or
(b) Having the same sample tested in a second laboratory.
Amplifying a second genome region could further increase test specificity.
However, until those tests have been adequately field-tested and
shown to be reliable, SARS diagnosis must depend on the clinical
findings of an atypical pneumonia not attributable to another cause
and a history of exposure to a suspect or probable case of SARS or
their respiratory secretions and other bodily fluids. This
requirement is reflected in the current WHO case definitions for
suspect or probable SARS. - Mod.CP]
