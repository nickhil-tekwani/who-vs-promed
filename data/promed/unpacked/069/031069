The Illinois Veterans Home [in Quincy, Illinois] confirmed another diagnosis of legionnaires' disease on its campus [Tue 28 Nov 2017]. The resident was taken to the hospital over the weekend [25-26 Nov 2017] and has since been released.

"We're glad the resident is doing well," said Dave MacDonna, Illinois Department of Veterans' Affairs spokesman, "but we're highly concerned. We're following everything the (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) is telling us to do."

The most recent legionnaires' [disease] case comes after 2 Illinois Veterans Home residents were diagnosed with the disease last month [October 2017]. One resident died, and the other recovered.

MacDonna described a state of "high alert" at the home, in which any resident who displays symptoms is tested regularly and rigorously and hospitalized if symptoms continue to progress. "If there are any symptoms, we're taking immediate action so we don't have the most terrible thing happen," he said.

The Veterans Home underwent a nearly USD 5 million rehabilitation of its water treatment plant in summer 2015 after legionnaires' disease sickened 53 people there and led to 12 deaths. 3 other residents were sickened during another outbreak last year [2016], less than a month after the new water treatment plant and delivery system were unveiled in June 2016.

"The number of cases nationwide is growing each year," MacDonna said. MacDonna believes the spike in legionnaires' [disease] diagnoses could be due, in part, to the increase in testing for the pneumonia-like disease. The CDC reported 6000 cases in 2015. Illinois sees about 300 cases each year. "We cannot get rid of _Legionella_," MacDonna said, "so we have to be on high alert all the time."

Older populations are among the more susceptible to the disease. Veterans Home Administrator Troy Culbertson told The Herald-Whig after last month's [October 2017] cases that the Veterans Home's water is tested 500 times a week across the campus and "all of our results have been negative." MacDonna said the home has done everything it can since the 2015 outbreak to curb the number of legionnaires' [disease] cases it sees on its campus.

[Many veterans' homes are managed and funded by state governments (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_soldiers%27_home). The Illinois Veterans Home in Quincy, Illinois, is responsible for providing economical and quality long-term care for veterans and their spouses, which includes domiciliary care, intermediate care, and skilled healthcare (http://www.quincyivh.org). According to its website, the Illinois Veterans Home in Quincy is one of the larger and older veterans homes in the country, with nearly 450 residents and over 25 buildings that house a post office, bank, assembly hall, guest house, mini post exchange, chapel, animal park, museum, and television station; water, sewer, gas, electricity, telephone, and data networks are owned and maintained by the Veterans Home.

In 2015, ProMED-mail posted a report on 53 cases of legionnaires' disease, including 12 deaths, at the Quincy veterans home, plus another 4 patients with legionnaires' disease in Quincy who were said to be not connected to the veterans home (Legionellosis - USA (15): (IL) fatal, veterans home, update, RFI 20150924.3668124).

The outbreak recurred in 2016, when 2 cases were reported in July 2016, less than a month after a nearly USD 5 million state-of-the-art water treatment plant and delivery system was unveiled at this facility (Legionellosis - USA (04): (IL) vet home, updated water treatment, new cases, RFI 20160728.4377020).

Again in October 2017, 2 more cases were reported in residents of the Quincy Illinois Veterans Home (ProMED-mail post Legionellosis - USA (17): (IL) vet home, updated water treatment, new cases 20171020.5394079) and now another case was reported in a resident of the Illinois Veterans Home.

We have not been told the species of _Legionella_ involved, the results of genotyping the patient and environmental _Legionella_ isolates, or any epidemiological linkages among the patients. More information in this regard would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

Quincy, with a population of 40 633 in 2010, is a city on the Mississippi River and the county seat of Adams County, Illinois, United States (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quincy,_Illinois). - Mod.ML
