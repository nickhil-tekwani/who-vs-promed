GIARDIASIS, CANINE - USA (GEORGIA) (02)

From: Prof Paul Hunter <Paul.Hunter@uea.ac.uk>

Regarding the response to the giardiasis in canines event in Georgia. Does
anyone else consider this to be an overreaction by the authorities?
Firstly, as the moderator states, some 8 to 50 per cent of canines carry
giardia anyway; so do we know for certain that the illness in the affected
dog really was giardiasis and that the giardia seen in the stool was not
just an "innocent bystander"?
Secondly, if giardia colonization is so prevalent in dogs, what protection
will be provided by quarantine?
Finally, the authorities are, apparently, strongly indicating a risk to
human health. The evidence from most epidemiological and genotyping studies
does not support the view that canines play a significant role in human
giardiasis (see: Hunter PR, Thompson RCA. The zoonotic transmission of
Giardia and Cryptosporidium. International Journal for Parasitology 2005;
35: 1181-90).

[Professor Hunter is asking questions with regard to the original article
published as ProMED-mail 20060331.0973. The article provides no answers to
any of his questions. Further, upon close examination of the article, it
suggests that if humans have flu-like symptoms, they should visit the
physician. But giardiasis in people causes diarrhea, bloating, gas, and
abdominal cramps. So, in response to Professor Hunter, it does seem the
authorities may have overreacted or perhaps -- as he suggests -- the
giardia in the stool sample was an innocent bystander. We would appreciate
a response from the officials in Georgia. - Mod.TG]
