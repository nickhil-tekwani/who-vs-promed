[1] Monoclonal antibody
Date: Tue 22 Sep 2020

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/16/health/coronavirus-drug-eli-lilly.html


A single infusion of an experimental drug markedly reduced levels of the coronavirus in newly infected patients and lowered the chances that they would need hospitalization, the drug's maker announced on Wednesday [16 Sep 2020]. The drug is a monoclonal antibody, a manufactured copy of an antibody produced by a patient who recovered from COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus. Many scientists hope that monoclonal antibodies will prove to be powerful treatments for COVID-19, but they are difficult and expensive to manufacture, and progress has been slow.

The announcement, by Eli Lilly, was not accompanied by detailed data; independent scientists have not yet reviewed the results, nor have they been published in a peer-reviewed journal. The findings are the interim results of an ongoing trial. [Please keep this in mind when reading this article. - Mod.MPP]

More than 450 newly diagnosed patients received the monoclonal antibody or a placebo infusion. Some 1.7 percent of those who got the drug were hospitalized, compared with 6 percent of those who received a placebo -- a 72 percent reduction in risk, Eli Lilly reported. Levels of the coronavirus plummeted among participants who received the drug, and their symptoms were fewer, compared with those who got the placebo.

The treatments that so far have shown to help coronavirus patients -- the antiviral drug remdesivir and the steroid dexamethasone -- are intended only for hospitalized patients. Those with mild to moderate disease have had to wait and hope for the best. Dr Myron Cohen, director of the Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said he was impressed. The clinical trial appears to be rigorous, and the results are "really compelling." Other companies, too, are developing monoclonal antibodies to combat the coronavirus, he noted: "This is the opening of a door."

Dr Rajesh T Gandhi, an infectious disease specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital, applauded Eli Lilly for studying people with mild to moderate disease. "That's where more than 80 percent of patients are," he said. Dr Gandhi said it was encouraging that the drug seemed to have lowered amounts of the virus in the respiratory tract, and said it might mean that patients could be made less infectious. But that would be difficult to demonstrate, requiring enormous trials, he added. While the data so far are "tantalizing," Dr Gandhi said, he wanted more detail and anticipated the completion of the study, which will include more patients.

Monoclonal antibodies are used to treat diseases from cancer to arthritis to eczema. But they are expensive and extremely difficult to manufacture. To make its monoclonal antibody, researchers at Eli Lilly gathered blood plasma from people who had survived infections with the coronavirus, retrieving and testing thousands of antibodies from the plasma to find the ones that seemed most powerful. Next, the scientists determined that antibody's genetic sequence and inserted DNA with that sequence into hamster ovary cells, turning them into tiny antibody factories. The cells were grown in huge stainless steel vats under aseptic conditions in a sterile room; this soup must be constantly monitored to ensure that it has not been contaminated by other microbes.

The study will eventually enroll 800 patients of all ages and in all risk categories at sites across the United States. So far the research has proceeded with unusual speed. Working feverishly, researchers at Eli Lilly needed just 6 months from isolating the antibody to enrolling the 1st patients on [17 Jun 2020]. "It was an all-out effort," said Dr Daniel Skovronsky, the company's chief scientific officer. Eli Lilly is also testing the drug in nursing homes to see if it prevents infections in residents and staff members.

In addition to constantly measuring the amount of the coronavirus in blood, the investigators also sought to understand whether the pathogen was mutating to avoid antibodies. They found that the virus was changing, to some extent: 8 percent of the viruses had mutated in participants getting the drug, compared with 6 percent in those receiving the placebo. (Presumably, the virus also was trying to dodge the natural antibodies that placebo patients were making on their own.)

The investigators expected that their drug might produce a reduction in the amount of virus in patients' nasal passages. They did not anticipate a sharp reduction in patients who needed hospitalization. "This is the 1st time we have ever seen anything of this magnitude," Dr Skovronsky said. The antibody drug did not produce significant side effects, he said. Patients received a single infusion, providing antibodies that should last about a month.

There is good news regarding a vaccine in these findings. If monoclonal antibodies had not worked, then the finding may have cast doubt on the notion that the virus could be stopped with antibodies. On the other hand, the results -- if they are proven accurate -- do not guarantee that a vaccine will work. Eli Lilly's monoclonal antibody is a temporary treatment; a vaccine is designed to elicit long-lasting natural antibodies and thus immunity.

Like other companies, Eli Lilly has been manufacturing large quantities of its drug -- 100 000 doses -- in the hope that it turns out to be effective. The company will be discussing its data with the Food and Drug Administration, Dr Skovronsky said, along with the possibility of obtaining an emergency use authorization allowing Eli Lilly to market the drug. If the findings hold up, there will be comfort for the public in knowing there is something doctors can do to head off dire illness, Dr Cohen said. "For my wife and I, who are older and fatter -- we are waiting for drugs like this so we can see our grandchildren," he added.

[Please keep in mind this is based on early data that haven't been fully shared yet - even earlier than pre-prints, hence data have not been available for review. Questions that come to mind (and they are numerous) include, were these 450 initial subjects heavily weighted to individuals of lower risk of severe disease (even though the ultimate stated goal is to include individuals from high risk groups)? Do the recipients develop their own antibodies in response to the infection? Or, do the infused antibodies mask the antigens so natural antibodies are not formed? Given the observation that a significant proportion of individuals have prolonged infections and symptoms, how long following treatment have the trial subjects been followed and what is the recurrence rate of symptoms in the recipients? - Mod.MPP]

[2] Convalescent serum
Date: Tue 22 Sep 2020
Source: US National Institutes of Health (NIH) [edited]
https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-expands-clinical-trials-test-convalescent-plasma-against-covid-19


Two randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials funded by the [US] National Institutes of Health (NIH) are expanding enrollment to further evaluate convalescent plasma as a treatment for patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Preliminary observational studies indicate that convalescent plasma may improve outcomes among severely ill and hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Prospective, well-controlled randomized trials are needed to generate sufficient data on whether convalescent plasma is effective and safe for the treatment of COVID-19. Convalescent plasma is blood plasma taken from people who have recovered from COVID-19. It contains antibodies that can recognize and neutralize SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, as well as other components that may contribute to an immune response.

"The evidence on convalescent plasma as a treatment for severe cases of COVID-19 is promising but incomplete. We need to carry out rigorous randomized control clinical trials to determine how this therapy can improve outcomes," said NIH Director Francis S Collins, MD, PhD. "While the world waits for an effective vaccine, it is vital that we simultaneously expand the options for available treatments for those currently suffering from the worst effects of this disease."

The trials expect to enroll hospitalized patients across the country at academic and community-based hospitals. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive the treatment or a placebo. Outcomes will be compared with respect to clinical improvement measures and resource needs, such as ventilators. Both trials currently are enrolling participants and anticipate results as early as this fall [2020]. The trials are receiving USD 48 million in support through Operation Warp Speed (OWS), a collaborative initiative across federal agencies to advance the development, manufacturing, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics.

The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), part of NIH, will oversee the grant awards through its Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) Program research network. The CTSA's Trial Innovation Network (TIN) will play a key role in working to add study sites and enroll patients, including those from communities disproportionately affected by COVID-19. "The rapid expansion of these vital randomized, controlled convalescent plasma clinical trials demonstrates how nimbly the network of CTSA Program hubs and the TIN can respond to the nation's research needs and shorten the path from discovery to treatment," said NCATS Director Christopher P Austin, MD.

One trial, called Convalescent Plasma to Limit COVID-19 Complications in Hospitalized Patients, was launched in April 2020 by NYU Langone Health in New York, with collaboration from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, and with funding from NCATS. To increase enrollment in the trial, NYU is partnering with The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston and the University of Miami in Florida to enroll participants at sites in these states.

With these additional sites, this trial expects to enroll approximately 1000 hospitalized patients 18 years or older with respiratory symptoms of COVID-19. The trial is primarily assessing clinical improvement at 14 and 28 days and also will be evaluating outcomes based on mortality, intensive care unit admission, and patient antibody concentrations. Additional information about this study and participation is available at ClinicalTrials.gov under study identifier NCT04364737 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04364737).

The trial called Passive Immunity Trial of Our Nation for COVID-19 also is expanding to enroll about 1000 participants. Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, which launched the trial in April [2020], will have access to about 50 additional clinical trial sites across the CTSA Program. Participants are 18 years or older with acute respiratory infection symptoms and laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection; they may be hospitalized or in an emergency department and likely to be admitted. The trial primarily will assess clinical improvement at 15 days and also will evaluate ventilation use, supplemental oxygen use, acute kidney injury, and cardiovascular events. Additional information about this study and participation is available at ClinicalTrials.gov under study identifier NCT04362176 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04362176).

[Note that this study is using the "original" convalescent sera, whereas the study mentioned in [1] above uses manufactured selected monoclonal antibodies. Another key difference is that this study is targeting already hospitalized (so by definition, moderately to severely affected individuals) and those more seriously affected in ICUs. These different target populations are critical to study as different stages of disease and complications from infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus may make one therapy more appropriate for one stage of illness and potentially dangerous for those in another stage. An example of this is the use of dexamethasone in later staged more serious disease vs giving it in the early stages with milder manifestations. In the earlier stages, the dexamethasone serves as an immunosuppressant when an immune response is necessary, but in later stages, the dexamethasone works to reduce the overactive immune response. "The RECOVERY trial provides evidence that treatment with dexamethasone at a dose of 6 mg once daily for up to 10 days reduces 28-day mortality in patients with COVID-19 who are receiving respiratory support. We found no benefit (and the possibility of harm) among patients who did not require oxygen." (Dexamethasone in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 -- preliminary report.

[3] Pooled saliva samples

ref: Fogarty A, Joseph A, Shaw D. Pooled saliva samples for COVID-19 surveillance programme. Lancet Respir Med. 2020. doi: 10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30444-6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Healthcare staff are at increased risk of COVID-19, thus putting themselves, their families, and their patients at risk. This increased risk negatively affects patient and staff mortality and morbidity (physical and mental). Furthermore, the need to isolate if either infected or exposed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease 2 (SARS-CoV-2) limits the ability of the UK NHS to deliver care when staff are absent from work. This potentially represents one of the biggest threats to providing timely health care as the 2nd wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection develops. Locally, approximately 1/5 of our patient-facing respiratory physicians were infected during the 1st COVID-19 surge in the UK (March-July, 2020), and 1/3 have had to isolate with symptoms or symptomatic contacts at least once. Local ward-based outbreaks have also occurred. Hence, there is a clear need for a robust COVID-19 surveillance system for NHS staff, enabling both staff and patients to have confidence that the risk of workplace nosocomial infection is as low as it can be.

The standard diagnosis for COVID-19 has been based on RT-PCR of a nasopharyngeal swab. However, this method has limitations, including a degree of discomfort for the patient, the need for close contact by a healthcare professional for a procedure that can result in coughing and aerosol generation, operator variation in technique, and the requirement for a large supply of swab testing kits. Consequently, the test cannot be easily scaled up to the point where healthcare workers can be tested regularly in an affordable, convenient manner.

On 28 Aug 2020, Anne Wyllie and colleagues published data [doi: 10.1056/NEJMc2016359] demonstrating that saliva is as sensitive for diagnosing COVID-19 as nasopharyngeal swabs.

Our interpretation of these data is that sampling saliva could be as good as, if not better, than nasopharyngeal swabs in diagnosing COVID-19. Although the usual caveat about replicating these data in different populations still applies, especially with regard to sample integrity the further the sampling is taken from the testing laboratory, these data do increase the options available for COVID-19 screening in larger populations. However, in the UK, and probably elsewhere, there are continuing logistical problems with COVID-19 diagnostic capacity. It is not currently possible to deliver the large scale, regular testing with a fast turnaround time, needed for an NHS staff COVID-19 surveillance programme.

One solution is sample pooling. The amplification of the COVID-19 signal by PCR makes the assay very sensitive to low levels of virus and hence allows a number of samples to be pooled and tested in one assay. This method opens the possibility of testing a community at a lower financial and resource cost. If the pooled sample is negative, then it is likely all individuals are negative and no further testing is needed. Similar to all COVID-19-related research, the field is in its infancy; however, pooling techniques are already used to sample untreated human waste-water for SARS-CoV-2 infection in communities, and in this setting, the assay might have the sensitivity to detect a positive COVID-19 case of one person in a population of 10 000 people.

Combining saliva sampling with pooling where concerns exist about the 2nd wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection could allow the development of a very efficient, relatively cheap surveillance system. We propose the following system that can be subsequently piloted, analysed, and refined as the evidence base develops. The system uses saliva sampling, pooling, and an additional insight from the world of drug testing in sports -- where 2 samples are taken, but initially, only one is analysed. All healthcare staff who are in contact with patients provide 2 saliva samples at least once a week. These are labelled Sample A and Sample B. Sample A is pooled with other samples and the combined pooled sample is tested. If the pooled sample tests positive for SARS-CoV-2, then the constituent individual Sample Bs in that pool are then tested to determine who provided the positive sample. Initial evidence suggests that up to 32 samples can be pooled.

This surveillance system does have challenges. There is a risk of detecting prolonged non-viable viral shedding and risk of contamination (both in pre-analytical and analytical steps) when handling large numbers of saliva samples in the laboratory. Both the cycle threshold and the number of samples that should constitute a pool need to be established because pooling efficiency will depend upon both pool size and COVID-19 prevalence. These metrics can be established concurrently, by taking a 3rd and 4th saliva sample or using nasopharyngeal swabs rather than Sample B. This approach would generate empirical data alongside a pragmatic healthcare surveillance programme, complementing and informing theoretical modelling of this approach, for which optimum pool size formulae are now available.

In our opinion, the potential benefits of a pooled 2 sample saliva-based surveillance system for COVID-19 outweigh any negatives and this approach should be trialled.

[Pooled sample testing procedures were developed by Harvard economist Robert Dorfman to detect syphilis in US soldiers during World War II. The technique of pooling has since been adapted for testing for influenza, chlamydia, and malaria. It has also been used for HIV testing. National blood donor screening for West Nile virus RNA using minipool nucleic acid amplification testing (MP-NAT) was implemented in the United States in July 2003 (https://dx.doi.org/10.3201/eid1203.051287). In July 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reissued an emergency use authorization (EUA) to Quest Diagnostics for a coronavirus test with pooled samples. In an FDA news release, officials said sample pooling is an important public health tool because it allows for more tests with fewer resources. The Quest test marks the 1st COVID-19 diagnostic test to get authorization for pooled samples, according to the statement.
(https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-issues-first-emergency-authorization-sample-pooling-diagnostic)

It must be determined how many samples can be pooled in one assay without compromising the assay by diluting the positive too much leading to a false negative result. The number will depend on the sensitivity of the assay -- the limit of detectability of the assay -- and the range of virus titers in the saliva in asymptomatic people and those with symptoms over time following infection. If an individual has possible COVID-19 symptoms, they should not be pooled with other samples. The infection rate in the area where the pooled testing is being conducted should be low, otherwise, pooled tests are likely to contain more than one positive specimen; it is not useful to pool in an area of high positivity because too many secondary tests would need to be performed. While not a new approach, pooling of specimens will facilitate testing populations more thoroughly and at a lower cost. - Mod.LK]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

Data by country, area, or territory for 22 Sep 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesSept22_1600806581.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 38.3% of daily case numbers and 37.8% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, maintaining its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 15.6 million cases. The USA and Brazil dominate, followed by Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Mexico, and Chile.

- The European region reported 16.2% of daily case numbers and 14.7% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 5.2 million. Countries not reporting cases today (22 Sep 2020) include Spain, Israel, and Sweden. In the absence of Spain, Russia has resumed dominance followed by the UK, France, Ukraine, and the Netherlands. Other countries reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours include Germany, Turkey, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Italy, and Switzerland.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 5.0% of daily case numbers and 8.9% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of greater than 2.2 million cases. Iraq remains the dominant country, followed by Iran, Libya, the UAE, Palestinian Authority, Oman, and Kuwait. Countries not reporting cases in the past 24 hours include Pakistan, Egypt, Morocco, Bahrain, Afghanistan, and Lebanon.

- The African region reported 1.4% of daily case numbers and 2.1% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.1 million cases. Ethiopia dominates, followed by South Africa, Reunion, Algeria, Nigeria, Uganda, Namibia, and Mozambique.

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.8% of daily case numbers and 0.83% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.58 million cases. The Philippines continues to dominate followed by Japan, South Korea and Malaysia.

- The South East Asia region reported 37.3% of the daily newly reported cases and 35.6% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 6.2 million cases.

Today's report from Europe has weekend reporting artifact with key countries not reporting new cases in the past 24 hours, and I suspect a similar situation in the Americas.

[The USA, India, and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations, with India now in the 2nd position followed by Brazil. In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (80 391), followed by the USA (51 721) and Brazil (35 252) -- account for over half of all confirmed cases globally (54.6%) and 57.5% of all newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. A global total of 6028 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (21-22 Sep 2020). Reporting numbers have risen, consistent with resuming fuller reporting following a weekend reduction in reports.

Countries reporting more than 5000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours include India, USA, Brazil, Argentina (12 027), Spain (10 799), France (10 008), Colombia (7102), and Russia (6215); 33 countries have reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours. Peru did not report any new cases in the past 24 hours. 10 of the top 20 countries reporting the highest daily newly confirmed cases are from the European region and 5 were from the Americas region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase in case counts by 2.9%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 3.2%.

Impression: Cases are increasing globally, with Europe and the Americas showing major increasing transmission in many countries. - Mod.MPP]
