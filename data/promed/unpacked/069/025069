As 1135 cases of measles have been confirmed in South Africa -- 1034
of them in Gauteng [province] -- laboratory tests confirmed an
outbreak in Johannesburg Prison. Gauteng Health spokesman Mandla Sidu
said 8 prisoners who were admitted to Soweto's Baragwanath Hospital
last week have measles "The situation will have to be assessed to
stop the spread of the epidemic in the facility. In the meantime, we
will continue to roll out our immunisation campaign," he told The
Times on Sunday [25 Oct 2009]. Last week, the Department of
Correctional Services immunised babies and toddlers staying with
mothers incarcerated in the prison's women's section.

The Gauteng Health Department has, over the past few weeks, been
conducting a measles vaccination campaign at creches and schools in
the province. "The immunisation drive has been going well, but we are
still calling for parents to make sure that their child is taken for
the vaccine, because measles can be fatal if not treated," Sidu said.

The Health Ministry confirmed 4 deaths from measles since the
beginning of September [2009], including a 56-year-old woman,
children aged 4 and 2, and a baby aged 7 months.

During the 1st 8 months of this year [2009], there were 48 cases of
measles in Gauteng, but this has shot up to 1034 since September 2009.

A measles outbreak at the Johannesburg Prison is worsening by the
day, with around 20 more prisoners diagnosed with the highly
infectious disease just this weekend alone. Those affected have been
isolated, while prison officials and inmates will be vaccinated from
Monday [26 Oct 2009].

Correctional Services Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula met
authorities at the facility on Sunday [25 Oct 2009]. She announced a
decision not to admit new inmates for the next few days. The effort
is part of a 10-day quarantine programme which starts on Monday [26
Oct 2009].

Mapisa-Nqakula said alternative arrangements have been made. "We are
requesting the police at the Johannesburg Central Police Station to
keep those people in holding cells. We are trying to take all steps
to make sure we contain the spread of the disease," said the minister.

[The measles outbreak in South Africa continues to escalate, with at
least 1134 cases and the deaths of an adult and 3 children in Gauteng
province alone. More than 20 prisoners in a Johannesburg prison have
contracted measles virus infection, which suggests that an
appreciable proportion of the adult population has escaped
immunisation and is at risk of infection.
