[1] Cholera - India (Orissa)
Date: Tue 28 Aug 2007

<http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?id=653c615b-dc97-40f4-af1d-64fcf7e865eb&&Headline=Cholera%2c+diarrhoea+claim+93+lives>

The waterborne diarrhea and cholera continued to play havoc in 3
Orissa districts as the death toll reached 93 on Tue 28 Aug 2007,
with hundreds of patients thronging government hospitals. The
districts of Rayagada, Koraput, and Kalahandi had been affected by
the post-monsoon waterborne diseases one and a half months ago but
the situation assumed an alarming proportion in the past 2 weeks.
"We have received so far information of about 93 deaths," a senior
official at the state health control room at Orissa's capital,
Bhubaneswar, told IANS. "However, reports are still reaching here and
we fear there may be a few more deaths," he added. "Of the 93 deaths,
49 are in Rayagada, 34 in Koraput, and 6 in Kalahandi district," he said.
All deaths in Rayagada district have been reported from 26 villages
under the Kashipur block. More than a dozen villages in 5 blocks have
been affected in Koraput. They are Dasmantpur, Laxmipur, Nandapur,
Kundura, and Sadar, he said, and added 20 people have died in the
Dasmantpur block in this district.
In Kalahandi the worst hit is Thuamul Rampur, he said. The situation
has improved and is now under control as only some sporadic cases
were reported in the affected areas on 27 and 28 Aug 2007, he said.
"At least 10 patients were admitted to the Kashipur government
hospital on Tue 28 Aug 2007," a district health official told IANS over phone.
Many people in the affected areas said the numbers of deaths and of
patients were much more than the government figure. "The government
is not disclosing the real number of people dead and affected,"
Taraprasad Bahinipati, congress Legislator from Koraput, said.
While local newspapers reported that the toll in the 3 districts was
more than 300, Bahinipati said that more than 100 people had died in
his area alone.
Cholera and diarrhea outbreaks are not new in the 3 districts, which
have been visited by the waterborne diseases almost every monsoon as
rainwater slush from hilltops contaminates water sources. Kalahandi,
Koraput, and Rayagada districts come under the undivided KBK
(Kalahandi, Bolangir & Koraput ) region, and are among the most
underdeveloped parts of the country.

A massive health awareness drive was launched in Guwahati after
laboratory tests on patients suffering from diarrhoea found strains
of cholera, officials said Sun 26 Aug 2007. Earlier this week 2
people, including a 9-year-old boy, died after an outbreak of
diarrhea in some city localities.
"A strain of _Vibrio cholerae_ Ogawa was found in the stool samples
of 4 patients who were among many other people admitted with symptoms
of diarrhea," said MM Deka, chief superintendent of the Gauhati
Medical College Hospital.

[3] Cholera - Iraq (north)

A cholera epidemic has spread in northern Iraq, particularly in
Kirkuk and Sulaimaniya, killing at least 5 people, the WHO has said.
A WHO source, refusing to be named, told the newspaper
laboratory-confirmed and observed cases of cholera in northern Iraq
could reach thousands and there were fears the epidemic could strike
other areas, due to poor sanitation.
The health minister in the regional Kurdish government, Zaryan
Othman, confirmed the cholera-related deaths and said thousands of
people have been hospitalized in the past week on suspicions of
contracting the disease.
Cholera has always been present in central and southern parts of
Iraq, particularly in the hot months of summer. But the epidemic has
rarely hit northern Iraq with such severity.
Health officials blame the disease on the disruption and damage to
water purification systems and pipes, saying it is not unusual for
heavy sewage water to mix up with tap water.
Iraq's health system is in a shambles. There is a severe shortage of
medical staff and supplies. Thousands of physicians and medical
specialists are reported to have fled the country.
While doctors in the Kurdish city of Sulaimaniya say they are certain
to contain the epidemic, the worsening conditions in the oil-rich
city of Kirkuk make the control of the disease rather difficult.
Politically Kirkuk is almost in an upheaval with the disparate
political and ethnic groups in a constant fight. Members of the Qaeda
organization have also increased their presence in the city as
pressure mounts on their traditional strongholds in central Iraq.
