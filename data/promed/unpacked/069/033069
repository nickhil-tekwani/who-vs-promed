Doctors in Viet Nam reported on Wed 21 Dec 2005 that they had found more
evidence that the H5N1 avian influenza virus can quickly mutate into a form
that resists the effect of Roche AG's frontline drug Tamiflu. 4 of 8
patients treated in Viet Nam for avian influenza infection died despite the
use of Tamiflu, Dr. Menno de Jong of the Oxford University Clinical
Research Unit at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City and
colleagues wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine [see reference below].
Tests showed that in 2 of the patients, the virus had become resistant to
Tamiflu. And in one patient, the drug was used very early on, as is
recommended. "It is becoming clear that to treat avian influenza with
neuraminidase inhibitors (such as Tamiflu) we are going to need higher
doses and a longer course of treatment for it to work," said Dr. Anne
Moscona, an expert in pediatric viral diseases at Weill Medical College of
Cornell University, New York. She and other experts said the findings
showed that such drugs must be preserved carefully and used properly.
The H5N1 influenza virus has killed 71 people in Indonesia, Thailand, Viet
Nam, China and Cambodia since 2003. The H5N1 strain is difficult for
people to catch. However, experts fear it could evolve into a form that
could pass easily from human to human, causing a pandemic that could kill
millions. The researchers and outside experts said the report concerned
only a few people and stressed that more study is needed. Of the 138 people
known to have been infected with H5N1, 31 have been treated with Tamiflu,
Roche said.
"This currently is not a pandemic strain," Dr. David Reddy, Influenza
Pandemic Taskforce Leader for Roche, told reporters in a telephone
briefing. "As it becomes a human pandemic it must change. It must shift.
That may lead to a loss of virulence. However, we are dealing with a
worst-case scenario today and we have to learn how to best manage it,"
Reddy added.
The findings add to a report published in October 2005 about a 14-year-old
Vietnamese girl who survived an H5N1 infection after being treated with
Tamiflu, but who had a drug-resistant virus strain in her body. 4 drugs
[can be used to] treat influenza, but H5N1 already resists 2 older drugs,
amantadine and rimantadine. Countries have been stockpiling the newer
drugs, known as neuraminidase inhibitors -- Roche and Gilead Science's
Tamiflu, known generically as oseltamivir, and GlaxoSmithKline and Biota's
Relenza, known generically as zanamivir.
De Jong and Moscona agreed that Relenza is a good alternative to Tamiflu.
"Furthermore, Relenza is active against Tamiflu-resistant virus," De Jong
said in an e-mail. But Relenza currently must be inhaled and may not be
useful in patients with respiratory conditions such as asthma, and it might
not spread past the lungs to protect other organs. There is not enough of
either drug to treat more than a fraction of patients should a bird flu
pandemic erupt this year. Roche is trying to license a generic process and
step up its own production to 600 million treatment courses by 2007.
There is an H5N1 vaccine but it is experimental and is unlikely to work
well against whatever pandemic strain may eventually emerge. De Jong said
Tamiflu must be used early on in infection to do any good against any type
of influenza. As with AIDS, a cocktail approach may be needed. There are
few options now. De Jong said one possibility to add to a cocktail is an
antiviral used against hepatitis [C virus] called ribavirin. BioCryst
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. has a new neuraminidase inhibitor in the works called
peramivir, which "may be an option in the future", De Jong said.

Signs that the H5N1 avian influenza virus may be developing resistance to
frontline drug Tamiflu in some patients are not necessarily a cause for
alarm, a senior World Health Organisation official said on Thursday. Keiji
Fukuda, a scientist at the WHO's global influenza programme, said some
resistance was inevitable with any kind of drug.
"Whenever you use any kind of drugs, antivirals or antibiotics, you expect
to see resistance develop in organs. Finding some resistance of itself is
not surprising and is not necessarily alarming," he told Reuters.
But findings published in the New England Journal of Medicine that 4 of 8
patients treated in Viet Nam for avian influenza infections had died
despite the use of Tamiflu indicated that more research was needed into how
best to use the drug, Fukuda said. "It just points out the need for more
information ... What really is critical is understanding whether the way we
are using the drugs contributes to that (resistance)," he added. Tamiflu,
made by Swiss firm Roche, remained an "excellent choice" among a limited
number of antivirals available against the deadly virus, the WHO official said.
2 more human deaths from bird flu in Indonesia were confirmed on Thu 22 Dec
2005, taking the known global total to 73, while cases including survivors
would rise to 141. All the deaths [and cases - Mod.CP] so far have been in
Asia. Experts fear the virus will mutate into one that can be passed from
human to human, rather than from fowl to people, and that such a mutation
might spark a pandemic, killing millions.

[The paper referred to in the above posts is a brief report in the New
England Journal of Medicine (Volume 353:2667-2672, 2005) by Menno D. de
Jong and 12 others, entitled "Oseltamivir Resistance during Treatment of
Influenza A (H5N1) Infection.
The Summary of the paper reads: "Influenza A (H5N1) virus with an amino
acid substitution in neuraminidase conferring high-level resistance to
oseltamivir was isolated from 2 of 8 Vietnamese patients during oseltamivir
treatment. Both patients died of influenza A (H5N1) virus infection,
despite early initiation of treatment in one patient. Surviving patients
had rapid declines in the viral load to undetectable levels during
treatment. These observations suggest that resistance can emerge during the
currently recommended regimen of oseltamivir therapy and may be associated
with clinical deterioration and that the strategy for the treatment of
influenza A (H5N1) virus infection should include additional antiviral agents."
The development of resistance to any antiviral agent, such as oseltamivir,
which targets a specific viral protein (the viral neuraminidase), is not an
unexpected event. It does suggest, however, that Tamiflu should be used
primarily for pre-exposure protection of healthcare personnel and others in
vulnerable occupations, rather than for treatment of patients exhibiting
early or late symptoms of influenza virus infection. As long as the A/H5N1
avian virus remains unable to spread from person to person, the appearance
of Tamiflu-resistant virus has limited significance, since it will not
spread unless recycled through poultry. - Mod.CP]
