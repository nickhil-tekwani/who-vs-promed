Athens, 29/03/97
Two people are in a serious condition in an Iraklion hospital with what is
thought to be Creuzfeldt-Jacob disease, according to unconfirmed hospital
sources.
The two, both in their fifties, were suspected of having the disease about
six weeks ago and a biopsy was performed indicating the syndrome. The tests
have been sent to Athens for confirmation.
Apparently meat associated with BSE had been found in searches carried out
around Crete about a year ago.
