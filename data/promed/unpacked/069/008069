Cholera--Madagascar: Compulsory Medication
Reported Compulsory Medication Would Constitute Violation of International
Law
The compulsory cholera medication reportedly being required by Madagascar
for incoming flights would, if true, constitute a violation of (1) the
International Health Regulations (IHR), and (2) international human rights
law.
International Health Regulations
As a member state of WHO, Madagascar is subject to the IHR. The measures
provided in the IHR are the maximum measures that a WHO member state may
take in reaction to outbreaks in other WHO member states of diseases
subject to the IHR (IHR, art. 23). The IHR specifically apply to cholera
(IHR, art. 1) and establish maximum measures that a WHO member state may
apply to goods and travellers coming from another WHO member state
suffering a cholera outbreak (IHR, arts. 61-64). Nothing in the IHR
permits a WHO member state to force travellers to take cholera medication.
Before WHO member states can take compulsory action, there must be some
indication that cholera is present either on the aircraft or in an
individual passenger. Thus, IHR article 64.2 provides that "[a person on
an international voyage, who has come from an infected area within the
incubation period of cholera and who has symptoms indicative of cholera,
may be required to submit to stool examination." WHO has long opposed the
use of mass chemoprophylaxis as a way to control cholera (WHO Guidelines
on Cholera Control, paras. 7.3 and 7.3.1). WHO's position is clear:
"Treatment of an entire community with antibiotics . . . has never
succeeded in limiting the spread of cholera" (WHO Guidelines on Cholera,
para. 7.3.1). WHO also believes mass chemoprophylaxis in the past has
"contributed to the emergence of antibiotic resistance in the [cholera
vibrio" (WHO Guidelines on Cholera, para. 7.3.1). The reported compulsory
dose of doxycycline would violate the IHR because it is not based on public
health principles or scientific information.
International Human Rights Law
Madagascar is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and
Cultural Rights (ICESCR). Arguments can be made that the compulsory dose of
doxycycline violates both these human rights treaties. Compulsory
vaccinations and medical treatment has long been considered an infringement
on a person's individual rights, but an infringement justified in many
cases to protect public health. The ICCPR reflects this positon. But a
public health measure that infringes on individual rights must satisfy four
criteria to be justified under the ICCPR: (1) the measure must be
prescribed by law; (2) the measure must be applied in a non-discriminatory
manner; (3) the measure must relate to a compelling public interest, such
as a significant infectious disease risk to the general population; and (4)
the measure must be necessary to achieve the protection of the public,
meaning that the measure must be (a) based on scientific and public health
information and principles; (b) proportional in its impact on individual
rights to the infectious disease threat posed; and (c) the least
restrictive measure possible to achieve protection against the infectious
disease threat (UN, Siracusa Principles on the Limitation and Derogation
Provisions in the ICCPR, UN Doc. E/CN.4/1984/4). Compulsory doses of
doxycycline for all incoming air travellers would not satisfy all these
fundamental criteria, and thus would violate the travellers' civil and
political rights under international law.
In addition, the requirement for all incoming passengers to take
doxycycline may violate the right to health found in the ICESCR (art. 12).
Some travellers may be allergic or have other adverse physical reactions to
doxycycline, but the reported requirement seems to make no allowance for
the health conditions of particular passengers. Forcing individuals to take
an antibiotic without proper medical due diligence or public health
justification may threaten the health of some people. In such cases, the
government of Madagascar would damage through gross or reckless negligence
the health of an individual and arguably violate that person's right to
health under international law.
