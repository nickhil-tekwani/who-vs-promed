Plague is a zoonotic disease caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_. [So
far] in 2006, a total of 13 human plague cases have been reported among
residents of 4 states: New Mexico (7 cases), Colorado (3), California (2),
and Texas (1).
This is the largest number of cases reported in a single year in the USA
since 1994. Dates of illness onset ranged from 16 Feb to 14 Aug 2006; 2 (15
percent) cases were fatal. The median age of patients was 43 years (range:
13-79 years); 8 (62 percent) patients were female. Five (38 percent)
patients had primary septicemic plague, and the remaining 8 (62 percent)
had bubonic plague. Two (15 percent) patients developed secondary plague
pneumonia, leading to administration of antibiotic prophylaxis to their
health-care providers.
This report summarizes 6 of the 13 cases, highlighting the severity and
diverse clinical presentations of plague and underscoring the need for
prompt diagnosis and treatment when plague is suspected.
Case 1. On 17 Feb 2006, a man aged 39 years from Travis County, Texas, was
hospitalized with a 1-day history of high fever, delirium, nausea, and
vomiting. Although lymphadenopathy was not detected on the initial
examination, a prominent axillary bubo was noted later. Blood cultures
yielded _Y. pestis_. The patient recovered after treatment with multiple
antibiotics, including gentamicin, doxycycline, ciprofloxacin, and
levofloxacin. Before his illness, the patient had hunted rabbits in Lea
County, New Mexico, and skinned the rabbit carcasses. Cultures from one of
the carcasses yielded _Y. pestis_ that was indistinguishable from the
clinical isolates when subtyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE).
Case 2. On 17 Apr 2006, a woman aged 28 years received the 1st diagnosis of
plague in Los Angeles County, California, since 1984. The woman was
hospitalized with fever, septic shock, and a painful right axillary
swelling;blood cultures grew _Y. pestis_. She responded to treatment with
gentamicin and levofloxacin. Although symptoms were compatible with bubonic
plague, the diagnosis had not been suspected because the patient did not
report traveling outside her urban Los Angeles neighborhood. Later,
health-care providers learned that the patient had handled raw meat from a
rabbit that had been killed in Kern County, California, and transported to
her home. An environmental investigation in Kern County revealed evidence
of die-off among jackrabbits and cottontails; rabbit carcasses collected in
the area yielded _Y. pestis_. PFGE patterns of isolates from the patient
and rabbits were indistinguishable. A total of 16 medical contacts and
family members and friends who had visited the patient's residence received
antibiotic prophylaxis.
Case 3. On 17 May 2006, a woman aged 54 years from Bernalillo County, New
Mexico, went to a local urgent care center with a 4-day history of fever,
severe abdominal pain, and bloody stools. No lymphadenopathy was noted.
While being evaluated, the patient began vomiting blood and experienced
acute respiratory distress. She was transferred to a regional hospital but
died within a few hours of arrival. Blood and lung cultures obtained at
autopsy yielded _Y. pestis_; however, no histologic evidence of plague
pneumonia was discovered. One of the patient's dogs and a rock squirrel
(_Spermophilus variegatus_) that had been trapped by investigators on her
property had serologic evidence of past infection with _Y. pestis_.
Case 4. On 25 May 2006, a man aged 45 years from Santa Fe County, New
Mexico, went to a hospital emergency department with a 3-day history of
nausea, vomiting, and fever to 104 degrees F (40 degrees C). Initial chest
radiographs revealed right lower lobe infiltrates; he was admitted with a
diagnosis of pneumonia. The patient was treated with gentamicin but was not
placed in respiratory isolation. On hospital day 1, the patient required
intubation for respiratory distress. On hospital day 2, blood cultures
drawn at admission yielded _Y. pestis_. The patient remained on mechanical
ventilation for 4 weeks and eventually recovered. At least 37 hospital
workers who had contact with the patient before he was intubated received
postexposure prophylaxis with doxycycline. Both of the patient's dogs had
serologic evidence of past _Y. pestis_ infection. _Y. pestis_ was isolated
from fleas (_Anomiopsyllus nudatus_) combed from a woodrat (_Neotoma
micropus_) that was trapped by investigators on the patient's property.
Case 5. On 9 Jul 2006, a man aged 30 years from La Plata County, Colorado,
went to a hospital emergency department with a 3-day history of fever,
nausea, vomiting, and right inguinal lymphadenopathy. He was discharged
home without treatment. Three days later, the man returned and was
hospitalized with sepsis and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Plague was
considered immediately, and the patient was placed in respiratory
isolation. He was treated with gentamicinand recovered. Five hospital
workers were administered doxycycline prophylaxis because of exposures
before respiratory isolation had been initiated. Cultures of blood and a
lymph node aspirate grew _Y. pestis_. One of the patient's dogs had
serologic evidence of past _Y. pestis_ infection. _Y. pestis_ was recovered
from fleas of 2 species (_Aetheca wagneri_ and _Pulex simulans_) collected
near the patient's home. A plague epizootic had been noted in the area, and
4 other human plague cases have been reported from La Plata County since
Jul 2005.
Case 6. On 18 Jul 2006, a woman aged 43 years from Torrance County, New
Mexico, went to a local clinic with a 1-day history of vomiting, diarrhea,
abdominal pain, and fever. The patient reported a recent dog bite and was
treated for presumed cellulitis. The next day, the woman returned to the
clinic because of worsening symptoms and pain in the left side of her
groin. She was transported by ambulance to the emergency department, where
inguinal lymphadenopathy was noted and plague was suspected. She was
admitted to the hospital, placed in the intensive care unit, and
administered gentamicin and doxycycline. _Y. pestis_ was isolated from
blood cultures. Despite treatment, she died on 22 Jul 2006. Animals trapped
on the patient's property, including 4 mice (_Peromyscus spp._) and 5 rock
squirrels, did not have laboratory evidence of infection with _Y. pestis_.

Editorial Note:
The natural reservoir of plague is wild rodents. Human infection usually is
acquired through the bites of infected rodent fleas and has an incubation
period of 1-6 days (1). Plague also can be contracted from handling
infected animals, especially rodents, lagomorphs (e.g., rabbits or hares),
and domestic cats, or through close contact with patients with pneumonic
plague. However, person-to-person transmission is extremely rare; the last
such transmission in the USA was reported in 1925. During 1990-2005, a
total of 107 cases of plague were reported in the USA (CDC, unpublished
data, 2006), a median of 7 cases per year. The increased plague activity in
2006 is consistent with the predicted relationship between climate and the
frequency of human plague in the southwestern USA. 2 consecutive Feb-Mar
periods with high precipitation and an intervening cool summer predicts
increased cases of plague the next summer; this effect is thought to lead
to increased reproduction and survival rates among rodents and fleas (2).
The principal forms of plague are bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic (3).
All of these forms can be accompanied by fever and systemic manifestations
of gram-negative sepsis. Bubonic plague is distinguished by the presence of
a bubo (i.e., one or more enlarged, tender, regional lymph node). Patients
with septicemic plague often have prominent gastrointestinal symptoms,
including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain (4), and patients
with pneumonic plague have dyspnea, chest pain, and a cough that can
produce bloody sputum. During 1990-2005, a total of 81 (76 percent) of 107
plague cases in the USA were classified as primary bubonic plague, 19 (18
percent) as primary septicemic plague, and 5 (5 percent) as primary
pneumonic plague; 2 (2 percent) were not classified (CDC, unpublished data,
2006). Eleven (10 percent) cases were fatal. In 2006, 5 (38 percent) of the
13 patients had primary septicemic plague, underscoring the need for
clinicians to consider this diagnosis !
in patients who do not have an obvious bubo. Septicemic and pneumonic
plague progress rapidly and are usually fatal without prompt treatment;
bubonic plague has a mortality rate of 50-60 percent if untreated.
In the USA, nearly all fatal plague cases are associated with delays in
diagnosis and treatment. In its early stages, plague is treatable with
appropriate antibiotics. Health-care providers should consider a diagnosis
of plague in persons who 1) have unexplained fever, suspected sepsis, or
pneumonia with or without lymphadenopathy or a classic bubo, and 2) live in
or have traveled to a plague-endemic region (e.g., the western United
States) (3). When plague is suspected, appropriate antibiotic treatment
should be initiated immediately and not delayed for laboratory
confirmation. Drugs effective against plague include streptomycin and the
tetracyclines. Although not approved by FDA for treatment of plague,
gentamicin is more readily available than streptomycin and has been used
successfully (5). Fluoroquinolones are used empirically to treat critically
ill patients and have demonstrated activity against _Y. pestis_ but are not
FDA-approved for this indication (6).
The majority of exposures to plague occur in the peridomestic environment
(3); free-roaming pets that bring infected rodent fleas into the home have
been suspected as a potential source of human infections. Persons residing
in areas where plague is endemic should keep their dogs and cats free of
fleas through regular use of flea treatments and by keeping them indoors.
Year-round rodent control should be conducted, including rodent-proofing of
structures and eliminating food sources (e.g., pet food or garbage) and
harborage (e.g., piles of wood or debris) in the peridomestic environment.
Persons who participate in outdoor recreational activities, particularly
rabbit hunting (7), in areas of epizootic plague activity also are at risk
for plague.
Personal protective measures include using insect repellents, wearing
protective clothing, and avoiding sick or dead animals. In areas of
epizootic plague activity, public health officials should treat rodent
habitats with insecticides and should educate the public regarding plague
prevention and control. Health-care providers and veterinarians should be
educated regarding the manifestations and diagnosis of plague. Antibiotic
prophylaxis might be indicated for close contacts (who come within 2 m) of
patients with plague pneumonia (5). Appropriate respiratory droplet
precautions should be taken when treating patients with suspected plague
who have evidence of respiratory involvement (8).
