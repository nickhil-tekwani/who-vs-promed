Romania's Agriculture Ministry imposed a temporary ban on the import of
Bulgarian livestock and products after authorities in Sofia reported cases
of so-called blue tongue disease.
The ministry said it had ordered an immediately effective ban on all
livestock, after being informed by Bulgaria's veterinary authorities of an
outbreak of the disease in the Bourgas Black Sea region. The disease is
fatal to animals.
Romania has been free of the disease, which is spread by mosquitoes, the
statement said [but see comment below.
The ministry banned grazing on a 5 Km strip of land along the Danube, the
common border of the two countries. The ministry introduced spot checks of
livestock in a broader 30km strip, and ordered spraying of insecticides on
lakes in the area.
Animals contracting the virus develop a distinctive blue tongue, mucus
membranes swell and the animal dies within about 3 days. Analysts said the
disease required the slaughter of an entire herd even if only a single
animal was infected.

[Bluetongue is a noncontagious viral disease of sheep, wild ruminants, and
rarely cattle, goats, and carnivores, Infection is much more common than
disease. Bluetongue infection and disease have been reported on all
continents except Antarctica.
Bluetongue virus is the prototype virus of the genus _Orbivirus_, family
Reoviridae. There are 24 serotypes worldwide. The viruses are biologically
transmitted between ruminants by the biting midge _Culicoides varipennis_
var. _sonorensis_, in the United States. Other biting insects are likely the
mode of transmission in other countries.
The usual incubation period in sheep is 5-10 days. Clinical signs include:
difficulty breathy with panting, redness of the lips, muzzle, ears, and a
high fever, depression and erosions and ulcerations of the mucous membranes
of the mouth. Other signs include swollen cyanotic (blue) tongue, lameness
and muscle necrosis. This listing of clinical signs is not comprehensive,
but is often regarded as those signs most frequently seen.
Clinical signs are presumptive, and confirmation is based on identification
of virus by isolation in embryonated chicken eggs, susceptible sheep or cell
cultures, or by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology.
Vaccines are widely used only in southern Africa. Vaccines are available in
other countries as well, but the practice of preventive bluetongue
vaccination is most widely used in southern Africa. Use of serotypes other
than the one(s) causing infection afford little or no protection. - Mod.TG
