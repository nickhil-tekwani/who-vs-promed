A Russian region has imposed a state of emergency after more than 400
people were taken to hospital and 15 died as a result of drinking
tainted alcohol, Russian television reported on Thursday.
The state of emergency was declared in the Pskov region, about 700 km
(435 miles) west of Moscow, but other regions across the country also
reported mass outbreaks of alcohol poisoning with dozens of deaths.
Public health officials who seized alcohol on sale in the Pskov
region found it contained substances usually used in medicines,
Channel One television said.
The substances react dangerously when mixed with alcohol, it said.
The first cases of alcohol poisoning were reported 3 weeks ago. Many
of the people who needed medical help are suffering from liver problems.
Prosecutors in Pskov region, which is on Russia's border with Latvia,
have opened a criminal investigation for selling food products unfit
for human consumption, the channel said.
Russia's is the world's biggest consumer of vodka, but its penchant
for the drink causes major health problems. Thousands of people die
each year from the effects of excessive drinking.
Bootleg vodka -- which can often contain methylated spirits and other
substances to boost its alcohol content -- is especially deadly.
In cases of alcohol poisoning elsewhere in Russia, 18 people have
died in the Irkutsk region of Siberia in the past few days and 70
people are being taken to hospital with the symptoms every day,
Itar-Tass news agency reported.
In the Ural mountains town of Kirov, 21 people have died from
acute toxic hepatitis brought on by drinking tainted alcohol,
Interfax news agency reported.

[With the number of people annually who are sickened or who die from
alcohol, it would seem the state would institute some rather strict
regulations regarding alcohol production. Of course regulations never
stop anyone from consumption of a cheaper or bootleg substance that
could be dangerous. ProMED-mail has carried a number of these
reports of adulterated alcohol poisoning. In most cases the alcohol
appears to have been be methanol or methylated in some way, but has
included other contaminants on occasion -- see refs below.
It should be noted that non-contaminated alcohol can cause hepatitis,
but the damage caused by methylated alcohol seems to be referred to
in these reports as 'toxic hepatitis.' - Mod.TG]
