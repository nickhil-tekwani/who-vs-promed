The controversial practice of killing wild badgers to prevent tuberculosis
in cattle is unlikely to succeed, according to a new study led by Rosie
Woodroffe, an ecologist at the University of California, Davis, and a
member of Britain's Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB.
In Britain, farming interests and badger protectionists have battled for 30
years over the merits of culling badgers to fight cattle tuberculosis, a
disease which can occasionally be transmitted to people. Farming ministers
are currently deciding whether culling should be continued, following a
public consultation on the issue which provoked over 47 000 responses.
Woodroffe's report, published Oct. 2 in the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences of the USA*, highlights the limitations of badger
culling as a control strategy for cattle TB.

Woodroffe examined the outcomes when badgers were culled as part of a
7-year experiment conducted by the British Department for Environment, Food
and Rural Affairs. Conventional wisdom suggested that this should reduce
transmission among badgers, as well as from badgers to cattle. Instead,
after 4 years of culling, infection rates in badgers had doubled.

Culling badgers should be a low priority for curbing cattle tuberculosis,
according to a scientist advising the British government. New research by
Dr Rosie Woodroffe and colleagues suggests that culling raises the rate of
TB infection in badgers. It also demonstrates that cattle infect badgers
with the bacterium.
Writing in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the
team suggests cattle testing and movement controls are a priority. "This
research has 2 important conclusions," said Dr Woodroffe, a researcher at
the University of California in Davis and a member of the UK government's
Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB.
"The first is that it shows for the first time that there is substantial
transmission of TB from cattle to badgers, whereas in the past it's been
assumed that didn't happen," she told the BBC News website. "The 2nd
conclusion is that repeated culling increases the prevalence in badgers --
each time you cull, it goes up and up."
The government is currently considering whether to introduce a cull, though
a consultation mounted recently by the Department for Environment, Food and
Rural Affairs (Defra) suggested public opinion is firmly against such a move.
Data for the latest research came from the Randomised Badger Culling Trial,
sometimes known as the Krebs trial after Sir John Krebs, the government
scientist who instigated it. An initial analysis, released last year,
showed mixed results for culling. Now scientists have looked again at the
data and tried to piece together a formula describing infection rates in
both cattle and badgers. Key to the new findings was the foot-and-mouth
disease epidemic of 2001, which brought a suspension of both cattle TB
testing and badger culling.
The following year saw a sharp rise in TB prevalence among cattle, which
was expected, and badgers, which was not. "We saw across seven study areas
a rise in the badger TB prevalence -- almost a doubling," said Dr
Woodroffe. "No other explanation fits the data."
Across the 8 years of analysis, culling was also associated with increased
TB in the badgers; areas which had received 4 culls saw a doubling of the
rate. What appears to be happening is that badgers move more freely and
more widely in culled areas, increasing contact with each other and with
cattle.
Animal welfare groups greeted the study enthusiastically. "This research
confirms beyond doubt that cattle are the main vectors of bovine TB,
readily infecting badgers and other cattle," said Trevor Lawson of the
Badger Trust. "The National Farmers Union (NFU) and other farming lobby
groups should now have the courage to call a halt to illegal badger killing
and to immediately withdraw their unsupported demands for state-sponsored
badger culls. Those callous vets who have demanded badger killing should
hang their sorry heads in shame."
But the NFU contended that culling has a role. "The evidence is clear; the
less you do about TB in badgers, the more infection you get in both cattle
and badgers," said spokesman Anthony Gibson.
Recent months have seen the incidence in cattle falling, which is widely
attributed to a strengthening of government controls on testing and killing
of infected herds.
And this, concluded Dr Woodroffe, is where the emphasis should lie in
policymaking. "In theory, if you could totally eliminate a badger
population in an isolated area, you would eliminate one transmission route;
though whether this would be feasible or desirable is another matter," she
said. "But improved cattle controls would have to be top of a policymaker's
list; and culling -- well, I'm not sure that would be on the priority list
at all."

[Unfortunately this whole problem is a lot more complicated than the
opposing proponents would be willing to accept. Simple badger culling on
farms with TB reactor cows just produces a void which badgers further out
move in to fill. And the perturbation causes infected badgers to move
outwards over a wider area. So badger-culling -- if it is to work -- must
be efficient and reach targeted culling levels, around 80 percent. At the
same time there must be a vigorous TB test and slaughter programme to clean
up affected herds.
The 3 English culling trials, prior to 1998, at Thornbury, Steeple Leaze
and Hartland Point and the large Irish trial in East Offaly achieved
culling targets of over 80 percent and produced a profound and sustained
reduction in bovine TB in associated cattle herds,
While it is clear that infected cows infect badgers -- how else would the
latter get infected otherwise? -- there is a movement in the opposite
direction, from badgers to cattle, or else how would the disease have
persisted in the face of cattle testing and culling?
Either or both actions need not exist on every farm but you just need a few
such events to keep the problem roiling. The problem is not made any easier
by the fact that badgers are now an agricultural pest in the UK, because of
their numbers and the damage they do, and at the same time their natural
attractiveness appeals to many, especially in urban areas, generating a
political force in a country where agriculture is no longer of any national
economic importance. I have asked for more informed comment than I can
provide; when it comes it will be posted. - Mod.MHJ]
