Three people are being treated for possible exposure to rabies after a rabid bat was found in their barn. It's the 1st time a rabid bat has been confirmed in Dufferin County in nearly 30 years. Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health officials said all 3 people that were exposed were part of the same family.

Health officials are reminding the public that if they come in contact with a bat indoors that they shouldn't touch it and should instead call a local animal control agency. Anyone who has direct contact with a bat should call their doctor or visit an emergency room. People who believe an animal is acting strangely should stay away from it, health officials added.

Rabies is a fatal virus that is spread by raccoons, skunks, foxes and bats through the saliva of an infected animal. That can happen through bites, scratches, open wounds or even mucous membranes near the mouth nose or eyes.

Health officials say rabid bats in Ontario are relatively rare. Last year [2018], 31 bats tested positive for rabies in Ontario. Since 2017, a total of 3 rabid bats have been found in the City of Guelph.

Despite its ability to infect all mammals, rabies virus persists in numerous species-specific cycles that rarely sustain transmission in alternative species. Rabies viruses recovered from bats were shown to be distinct from rabies viruses recovered from terrestrial mammals, suggesting that these viruses evolved within their bat hosts. Genetic evidence suggests that rabies is an old disease for bats in the New World. Bats from most of the bat species in North America, when sampled in sufficient numbers, have been found to be infected with rabies virus.

Bat rabies viruses are genetically diverse, exhibiting mutations characteristic to each host bat species. It should be taken into account, however, that bat rabies can be transmitted to humans and their domestic animals, with infections almost always fatal unless treated. Also, a dog, cat or ferret infected with a bat rabid virus can infect a human. - Mod.PMB
