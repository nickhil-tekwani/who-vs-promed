Health authorities suspect an unknown virus in the death of a child and
illnesses of 15 others at a Northhampton, Massachusetts, nursing home's
pediatric unit. Children began showing systems of the respiratory illness
like coughing and congestion on Sept. 1 at the Northampton Nursing Home,
according to a spokeswoman for the state Health Department.
The child [exact age unknown but another newspaper indicated she was 12
years old] died late last week. Health officials believe an unknown
[unidentfied?] virus contributed to the death and made the other children
sick.
Nine of the children were sent to hospitals over the weekend in Springfield
[Massachusetts] and Northampton. Others have been recovering. There were
about 30 children in the nursing home's pediatric unit before the transfer.
State and federal officials were conducting tests to find the cause of the
illness. Meanwhile, the nursing home stopped admissions to the pediatric
unit, curtailed visitation, and stressed hand washing by staff.
There may be no danger to the public. Many of the children in the unit were
already very sick with weakened immune systems.
