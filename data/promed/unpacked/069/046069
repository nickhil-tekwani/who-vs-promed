New corn disease confirmed in Indiana
---------------------
Plant pathologists from Purdue University have identified tar spot, a corn disease not previously reported in the United States, in plant samples collected in Indiana.

The fungal disease is endemic [elsewhere in the Americas], including Mexico and Central America. Experts say no action is needed to manage it this late in the growing season.

"We are still determining the impact, if any, that the disease may have in Indiana," said Kiersten Wise and Gail Ruhl, Purdue. "However, it is important to alert extension specialists if you observe the disease to accurately document its distribution in the state."

[Tar spot of maize is a disease complex, which has been known to cause serious yield losses of up to 75 per cent in Central and South America. It is caused by the association of at least 3 fungal species: _Phyllachora maydis_, _Monographella maydis_ and _Coniothyrium phyllachorae_.

Of these, _P. maydis_ is usually the 1st to cause leaf lesions. While _M. maydis_ is a common benign saprophyte on leaf surfaces, it becomes highly virulent only in association with _P. maydis_ and forms necrotic rings around the _P. maydis_ lesions. _C. phyllachorae_ may be a hyperparasite of the other 2, but its role is not fully understood yet. Leaf lesions may coalesce causing blight and complete burning of the foliage. In addition, characteristic black, shiny spots ("tar spots") are produced both within lesions and on other leaf areas. The disease reduces photosynthetic potential and therefore plant vigour. Affected ears have fewer kernels which may germinate prematurely on the cob.

_P. maydis_ is an obligate parasite; its spores are spread by wind and with infected plant material, and it produces a potent toxin, killing plant tissue. The disease is favoured by cool, humid conditions. Disease management may include fungicide treatments, but relies mainly on the use of resistant maize varieties. However, little is known about the genetics of tar spot resistance.

According to the Purdue report, so far only _P. maydis_ has been found associated with diseased maize in the US. A source of the incursion is being investigated. Additional introduction of _M. maydis_ would increase the risk of yield losses for US maize producers.
