A private hospital in Ghatkopar [part of greater Mumbai] has reported a case of a rare hantavirus infection that is similar to leptospirosis.

A 39-year-old man from Kurla, who told doctors that he was bitten by a rat, was treated for the potentially deadly viral infection, which is spread by mice and rats through urine, droppings and saliva.

Though the hospital said it had followed rules and notified the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) about the case, the civic body said no such case has been reported in Mumbai and the rest of India.

"We consulted the Bombay Veterinary College, and they said no hantavirus case has been reported in Mumbai. It is zoonotic disease (passed from animals to [humans])," said Dr Mini Khetarpal, chief of BMC's epidemiology cell. She added that there has been no reported case of hantavirus ever. However, there have been at least 2 cases reported in Mumbai, in 2006 and 2010.

The patient had fever since 27 Jun [2015], and he consulted a doctor, but his condition deteriorated. His wife, who is a nurse at Sapna Hospital in Ghatkopar, said: "A week later, I got him admitted to the hospital where I work."

He was initially admitted to the general ward, but he developed breathlessness and low oxygen levels in the blood. "We had to shift him to the intensive care unit and put him on a non-invasive life-support system," said Dr Pinkesh Chandra, general physician. "As I suspected it to be [a] hantavirus [infection], I sent blood samples for testing and continued symptomatic treatment. This improved his condition," said the doctor.

The man was discharged after 10 days. "On 17 Jul [2015], I got the report, which confirmed my suspicion. The patient then told me that he had been bitten by a rat," said Dr Chandra.

Doctors suspect that there could be more cases of hantavirus [infections] that have gone unreported or undiagnosed. "It is believed to be rare, but the fact is we are not testing enough or accurately," said Dr Om Srivastava, an infectious diseases expert.

Dr Chandra informed the BMC's N Ward (Ghatkopar) office last week about the hantavirus case.

[Cases of hantavirus infections in humans in India are reported occasionally. The hantavirus responsible for this case of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is not stated. Information would be appreciated. The most recent cases of reported suspected hantavirus infections in India were in January 2014 in Kerala and October 2011in Andhra Pradesh, where there were 3 cases of a suspected hantavirus infection in Nellore. The specific hantavirus involved in these cases was not stated either. In Asia, there are 5 recognized hantaviruses with their main rodent reservoir species, including: Hantaan virus (_Apodemus agrarius_), Amur virus (_A. peninsulae_), Thailand virus (_Bandicota indica_), Seoul virus (widely distributed worldwide in _Rattus norvegicus_), and Muju virus (_Myodes regulus_).

In a 4 Feb 2010 ProMED-mail post (archive no. 20100205.0385), it was reported that Dr J. Clement and colleagues of the National Reference Laboratory for Hantavirus Infections, University Hospital Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium found evidence in India of the murine Seoul virus (SEOV) infection and also of the arvicoline Puumala virus (PUUV) infection, the latter in 2 fatal cases (from the Cochin and Chennai regions, respectively) with acute respiratory syndrome, symptoms similar to those in the more recently described Nellore cases in 2011 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20111026.3187) as well as in the case described in 2011.
