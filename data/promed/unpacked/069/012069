We have been waiting for the state epidemiologist or the site investigating
team to report to you about the Idaho hantavirus case fatal for a female in
her 40s. I report what was informally discussed with the district health
department epidemiologist investigating the case.
The woman lived in a mobile home with her family (spouse and two older,
teenaged (?), children) who are not symptomatic and appear healthy. The
home is an older (>20years) mobile home which had "heavy" rodent
infestation. It is located on a pasture-like site with harborage for
rodents, grass, weeds, scattered junk surrounding the home. Two of 15
rodents (I believe all were deer mice) trapped as part of the investigation
were "positive" for hantavirus. The surviving family members were going to
attempt a cleanup of the home following CDC and health district guidelines.
Hopefully, a final, formal report will be forthcoming.

Two cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) have been reported in
Arizona in 1999 (as of June 4); both in northern Arizona and both with
onsets in May. The first case involved a 45 year-old female from Apache
County. Lab confirmation was made in New Mexico. At last report, she was
still listed in critical condition.
The second case involved a 71 year-old male from Coconino County. He
developed symptoms in late May approximately 3 weeks after disturbing
rodent droppings while doing renovations on a nearby house. His clinical
course was mild in comparison to most HPS cases. HPS diagnosis was
confirmed by serology at the Arizona State Laboratory (IgM pos. to Sin
Nombre virus at titer 1:6400). Presumably, this case is the oldest HPS
case reported thus far in the country as he did have interstitial pulmonary
infiltrates on X-ray along with mild hypoxemia. Overall, Arizona has had a
total of 27 cases of HPS (6 fatal) with onsets dating back to 1992.
[In spite of what appears to be accepted by many, regarding serodiagnosis
of many virus infections, results of IgM assays with a single serum can
only provide a "presumptive", not a "confirmed" diagnosis. Nonetheless,
detection of serum IgM to Sin Nombre virus has a high clinical significance
and should provide information useful for public health decisions. - Mod.CHC

A Cibola County woman has died of complications from hantavirus. Hers was
the fourth hantavirus-related death in New Mexico this year. The
56-year-old woman had been admitted to University Hospital on April 27 in
critical condition and placed on a special machine that helps the lungs and
heart by infusing blood with oxygen and moving it through the body. She
was taken off the machine May 7 and transferred to the intensive-care unit,
where she died late Sunday night, a hospital spokesman said Monday.
[Overall, New Mexico has had 42 cases of hantavirus, 22 of them fatal. All
of New Mexico's cases this year have come from the northwestern part of the
state. Three of the four previous patients died: a 15-year-old San Juan
County girl who died April 15, a 43-year-old Cibola County woman who died
March 25 and a 42-year-old McKinley County man who died Feb. 9. The patient
who survived was a 10-year-old San Juan County boy admitted to University
Hospital on April 1 and released four days later. Hospital authorities said
he was not placed on the special machine because his symptoms were not as
severe. A 45-year-old Apache County, Ariz., woman brought to the hospital
earlier this month with hantavirus also died [see above.
Last year, University Hospital did not treat nearly as many hantavirus
patients this early in the year. The hospital received its fifth patient of
1998 on Aug. 24.

[Given the HPS case in Alberta, Canada (990512142639, 990519230033,
990522201159) and at least one death due to HPS in Colorado, this may be a
year in which we see an increase in numbers of HPS cases in western North
America. At one of our study sites in southwestern Colorado we have
detected antibody to Sin Nombre virus in an exceedingly high proportion of
deer mice. - Mod.CHC
