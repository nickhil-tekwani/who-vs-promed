The Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS) has launched an investigation into claims that some pet foods may be toxic, resulting in the deaths of dogs and other animals in some parts of the country. According to a feature on NTV aired on 11 Jul 2020, the standards regulator swung into action after pet owners reported cases of dogs dying in large numbers.

A pattern emerged in the postmortem results provided by veterinary doctors who found a high level of aflatoxin. "Internal organs show signs of acute aflatoxicosis. There was heavy bleeding in the stomach and intestines. The liver, kidney, lungs and heart were swollen and bleeding," one of the autopsy results reads in part.

There has been a surge in dog deaths in Kenya. A dog breeder based in Kirinyaga lamented over the death of 10 of his dogs, going on to reveal that the dogs suddenly turned docile, weak and withdrawn after consuming the feed before dying. Alex Njoroge, another dog breeder had the same report, adding that postmortem results from his dogs showed a swollen liver which had turned yellow.

Several other dog owners shared the same view, with Dr David Kibaria, a vet based in Kitengela affirming that he had registered a surge in the number of dogs admitted at his facility. In just a few weeks, he stated that 20 dogs were brought in, all showing symptoms of aflatoxin poisoning.

One of the pet food brands named in the feature responded to the media house with a statement asserting that their production process adheres to global best practices. The firm also directly responded to a pet owner, SM, who had tagged its product as being responsible for her dog's death by pointing out that if any pet food is left exposed in high humidity and damp conditions, aflatoxins could develop.

[A number of different grains are often used in the production of dog food.

Aflatoxin is usually an accidental contamination because of the way aflatoxin grows. Aflatoxin, a naturally occurring chemical coming from a fungus sometimes found on corn and other crops, can cause severe liver damage. The growth of aflatoxin is not uniform in a batch of grain. Dogs can and do recover from aflatoxin intoxication; however, an accurate diagnosis is required as well as testing of the food and removal of contaminated food from the animal.

Dogs are susceptible to aflatoxin in the grain often used to make pet food. Low levels of aflatoxin for a long period (120 or more days) can cause liver failure and jaundice. It will cause elevated liver enzymes. It can cause death. Dogs can and do recover if removed from the contaminated grain or the contaminated food substances.

Very high levels of aflatoxin in the food may produce acute clinical signs including lethargy, jaundice, melena (blood in the stood, or dark tarry stools) and vomiting. Please take the pet to the veterinarian. If you are in an area where food is suspected of being contaminated with aflatoxin, remove the food from the dog and seek medical care for your pet.

If you notice that your pet food is on a recall list, remove the suspect food from your pet and feed a different food. Take the food to the veterinarian and request that the food be tested for aflatoxin.

Aflatoxin in grain is produced because the microclimate of the grain is right for the production of the _Aspergillus flavus_ or _Aspergillus parasiticus_ to grow. The presence of mold does not mean the toxin is present, as the mold may not be producing toxin. The lack of mold does not mean the absence of toxin either, as the mold may have died, leaving the toxin.

Leaving grains in the sun does not alter the aflatoxin content. Roasting the grains does not alter the aflatoxin content either.

Ammoniation of the grain will destroy the aflatoxin, but the grain is then only suitable for consumption by ruminant animals.

There is a clay product that is specifically used for binding aflatoxin, but it does not destroy the aflatoxin. It may be something to consider, as this can be used for monogastric consumption. But the product is very specific and not just any clay will work.

Even if a grain is handled and processed properly, a hot spot of aflatoxin can contaminate the grain and the food. Unfortunately, even if the company has done everything right, the food may still be contaminated. Alternatively, the same mold can grow at the owner's location because of the conditions in which a bag of food may be stored. The food should be stored in a dry and, ideally, low humidity area in a sealed container to prevent humidity and bugs from entering the pet food. - Mod.TG
