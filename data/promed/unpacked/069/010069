With the rainfall in some regions, foliar diseases have started to
appear [on wheat]. [Experts] stress the importance of surveillance
and the impact of the use of fungicides. Losses due to disease can
range from 10 to 20 percent on average.
Just as rainfall contributed to the growth of the cereal, it also
favoured the progress of foliar diseases. "Now there is concern and
dedication to care for and protect the wheat," said Marcelo Carmona,
Faculty of Agronomy, UBA [University of Buenos Aires].
In particular, the rains enabled the spread of yellow leaf spot in
much of the grain region. Rainfall is important for this disease.
Leaf rust was delayed due to the low temperatures. "However, already
there are foci of leaf rust from the north to the south of the Pampas
region," said the expert. "In areas such as Castelli, Maipu,
Pergamino, and southern Santa Fe, yellow leaf spot and the beginnings
of leaf rust are being reported," he added.
Cristina Palacio, another expert who performs constant monitoring in
southern Santa Fe, said: "Recent rains and warm temperatures favoured
the spread of wheat foliar diseases, especially yellow leaf spot and
septoria leaf spot." About leaf rust she said: "While intermediate
severity is not yet apparent, weekly monitoring is important because
of the favourable conditions [for the disease] in recent weeks."

[An additional news story reports that Entre Rios is the area most
affected by wheat diseases. The presence of a rust, yellow and brown
leaf spots, some septoria and powdery mildew are mentioned. Rust on
maize crops in Santa Fe is also reported. In Cordoba, farmers are
alerted to watch soybean crops because of frogeye leafspot inoculum
found on seed

[2] White mould, peanuts - Nicaragua

Low rainfall is affecting around 25 000 ha [60 000 acres)] of peanuts
in Chinandega, which are exposed to an increase in white mould, a
harmful fungus that stains the grain, reduces the yield by 10
percent, and increases the cost of production.
Producers fear that, for now, not even fungicide application would
remove the pressure on the plants because of the drought. Agronomists
explained to reporters from La Prensa that it is not effective to
counter the disease without rain.
A month before the harvest, the weather is overwhelming the
producers. One of them said that the plantations in Chinandega
apparently are lush, but the fungus is imperceptible, the reason he
fears that in one month the pest could affect thousands of acres in
the whole country. "The problem is that there is a period with good
weather and no rains, but when they come suddenly, diseases appear in
peanuts," he explained.
In West Nicaragua, after the disappearance of cotton cultivation,
peanuts became an exportable alternative, with more than 100
producers in the area.

[3] Phomopsis, soybean and ear rots, maize - USA

Wet weather is delaying harvest across Indiana and Ohio, and fungal
diseases in corn and soybeans have damaged what was expected to be a
bumper crop. Ear rot in corn and phomopsis seed decay in soybeans are
reducing grain quality this year [2009], diseases that thrive in wet
conditions, plant pathologists say.
Phomopsis is typically rare, but conditions this summer [2009] with
frequent rains and now delayed harvest are the perfect environments
for the soybean pathogen to take hold, said Anne Dorrance, Ohio State
University.
Diplodia and gibberella ear rots are being seen in many Indiana
cornfields. Diplodia ear rot is throughout the state, especially in
the northeast and southeast, said Charles Woloshuk, Purdue. Infection
ranges from only a small percentage up to 30 percent of the ears, he
said. "If it's gibberella ear rot, then there's concern about the
mycotoxin deoxynivalenol or DON, as well as zearalenone. If suspect,
the grain should be tested, especially if it's to be fed to
livestock," Woloshuk said.
[In Ohio, gibberella is reported to be the most prevalent ear rot
this year [2009], however, reports of diplodia in some fields have
also been received:
<http://www.zanesvilletimesrecorder.com/article/20091019/NEWS01/910190320>.
Particularly severe diplodia levels are also reported from the entire
corn belt region, and damage exceeding 50 percent due to mouldy maize
has been reported from some parts:

[Humid weather at the end of the season predisposes many field crops
to fungal attacks and favours disease development. For more
