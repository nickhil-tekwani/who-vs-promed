Abstract
--------
Mali had 2 reported introductions of Ebola virus (EBOV) during the 2013-2016 West Africa epidemic. Previously, no evidence for EBOV circulation was reported in Mali. We performed an EBOV serosurvey study in southern Mali. We found low seroprevalence in the population, indicating local exposure to EBOV or closely related ebolaviruses.

Conclusions
Given the limitations of our study and a conservative approach for interpretation, our results indicate that the population in southern Mali has been and likely still is exposed to EBOV, other Ebolavirus species, or related filoviruses at a seroprevalence of 1.5%-6.1%, which is in the range described previously in west and central African countries (13,14). Additional work is needed to support this finding, including human surveillance in other regions of Mali. Public health preparedness in Mali should include filoviruses. Initial ecologic studies aiming at identifying potential reservoir species of filoviruses seem justified for southern Mali.

Excerpts:
Southern Mali borders Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea, and Burkina Faso. This region shares one ecosystem; therefore, southern Mali is likely to harbor similar arthropod, rodent, and bat species as the neighboring countries, suggesting the possibility that similar zoonotic pathogens may be present (4,5) (Figure). Therefore, we tested human serum samples originally collected in southern Mali for Lassa fever surveillance (6) for the presence of EBOV antibodies.

Several scenarios may explain the results of this study. First, EBOV or a related filovirus is endemic and circulating in its reservoir species in southern Mali leading to occasional human exposure. This scenario is supported by a similar geographic environment in the southern neighboring countries that had documented EBOV seroprevalence (4,5) (Figure). A drawback of this hypothesis is the current failure of finding EBOV or closely related viruses in wildlife species, particularly bats, in most West African countries. However, Bombali virus, a new Ebolavirus species, was discovered in bats in Sierra Leone and Guinea (7,8); serologic testing has also indicated circulation in pigs in Sierra Leone and Guinea (9,10).

A 2nd scenario is that exposure in southern Mali was temporary and occurred through human-to-human contact from cross-border movement during the West Africa EVD outbreak.

Third, all seropositivity is due to cross-reactivity with other viruses or to unspecific, low-affinity antibody binding. Filovirus serology, especially for EBOV, has been controversial over the years. Early reports of sometimes high seropositivity in certain regions and populations in Africa were generally thought to be the result of cross-reactivity from the use of assays with low specificity (11). However, serologic testing tremendously improved with highly specific and sensitive assays (12). Thus, the assumption of false positives as an explanation for the results seems unlikely.

Finally, caution may be necessary when interpreting serologic test results for EBOV and related filoviruses in populations in Africa. Because more reliable, highly specific, and sensitive serologic tests are available, more attention should be given to establishing proper algorithms for interpretation. Confirmation by independent tests including virus neutralization assays will help. Unfortunately, serum sample volumes in this study were too low to enable such confirmatory testing.
