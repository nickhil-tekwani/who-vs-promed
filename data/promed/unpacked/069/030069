[This is good news. It does appear as though control measures are working and transmission if not already interrupted is on the way to being interrupted with the trend for decreasing numbers of cases reported over the past week, down to 1 case yesterday and no cases today.

There is no official MOH statement on the website as yet for 20 Jun 2015, but the above media report explains the current situation adequately.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - Republic of Korea - 19 Jun 2015
------------------------------------------
Situation in Korea
Between [17 and 19 Jun 2015], the National IHR Focal Point of the Republic of Korea notified WHO of 12 additional confirmed cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) alongside 5 additional deaths.

Additional information on the outbreak in Korea
To date, a total of 166 MERS-CoV cases, including 24 deaths, have been reported. One of the 166 cases is the case that was confirmed in China and also notified by the National IHR Focal Point of China.

The median age of the patients is 68.5 years old (ranging from 16 to 87 years old). The majority of cases are men (60 percent). Twenty-one cases (7.9 percent) are health care professionals. To date, all cases (excluding the index case) have been linked to a single chain of transmission and are associated with health care facilities.

Detailed information concerning MERS-CoV cases in the Republic of Korea can be found in a separate document ([see http://who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/MERS-CoV-cases-rok.pdf for a line listing of cases, http://who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/maps-charts/en/ for maps and epicurves related to the outbreak]).

Public health response
The government of the Republic of Korea continues to implement intense case and contact management activities. As of [19 Jun 2015], 5930 contacts are being monitored while a total of 5535 contacts have been released. The number of new cases occurring each day appears to be declining. This suggests that the containment measures in place are contributing to reduce the rate of new infections.

On [16 Jun 2015], the Director-General of the World Health Organization convened the 9th Meeting of the Emergency Committee on MERS-CoV under the International Health Regulations. The WHO Secretariat provided the Committee with updates on the epidemiology of MERS-CoV in the Republic of Korea and China. The Committee expressed the need for all countries to be better prepared for the unanticipated possibility of an outbreak but concluded that MERS-CoV does not currently meet the conditions to be classified as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.

Global situation
Globally, since September 2012, WHO has been notified of 1333 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 471 related deaths.

[The WHO update reconfirms the MOH report of yesterday (see MERS-CoV (71): Thailand ex Oman, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, UAE 20150618.3447481). For those who are interested in more epidemiologic details on the situation in South Korea, I strongly recommend going to the links on the WHO website where there is a line listing of all 166 cases with details on each of the cases as well as maps and epicurves on the outbreak. Thanks to the South Korean MOH and WHO for making all of this data available.

As of 12 Noon today, 19 Jun 2015 there have been a total of:
1037 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection including
459 deaths
571 recoveries
7 currently active cases

In the past 24 hours there have been a total of:
2 newly confirmed cases

[reported case fatality rate 44.3 percent]

Information on newly reported cases:
1- A 52 year old Saudi male, non-healthcare worker from Hufoof, currently in stable condition. Possible history of contact with other case(s) currently under review.

2- A 61 year Saudi female, non-healthcare worker from Hufoof, currently in critical condition. Possible history of contact with other case(s) currently under review.

Information on newly reported fatality:
A 54 year old Saudi female, non-healthcare worker from Hufoof with a history of pre-existing co-morbidities [reported as a laboratory confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection on 14 Jun 2015 at which time she was noted to be in stable condition.

[Transmission of MERS-CoV in Hufoof continues. There are now a total of 37 laboratory confirmed cases including 20 deaths in Hufoof (reported case fatality rate of 54.1 percent). Of note is that since 1 Jun 2015, 5 of the 11 reported fatalities were in individuals what at the time of initial confirmation were noted to be in stable condition -- similar to the fatality reported today. I wonder what the clinical courses are -- especially when seeing a patient was listed as in stable condition one day, and 5 days later is listed as a fatality. It would be interesting to have more information on the cases involved in this outbreak, including chains of transmission/contact between earlier cases and later cases.

[4] Thailand ex Oman, UAE - media report

http://timesofoman.com/article/58787/Oman/Health/MERS-75-year-old-businessman-from-Sultanate-of-Oman-is-Thailands-first-case-of-Middle-East-Respiratory-Syndrome


Omani businessman kept in Thai hospital isolation as tests confirm MERS
----------------------------------------------
An Omani citizen has tested positive for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers) in Thailand. So far 6 cases of MERS have been reported in the Sultanate.

The last case was reported in May [2015]of a 75-year-old man suffering from severe pneumonia and high fever.

Even as [the report on the Omani case confirmed in Thailand was released], The National on Thursday,[18 Jun 2015] citing Abu Dhabi Health Authority confirmed the death of a 65-year-old expatriate from MERS. The patient, not an Emirati, was one of the 2 new confirmed cases in the country.

Thailand authorities said on Friday [19 Jun 2015] that a 75-year-old businessman from Oman, who had travelled to Bangkok for medical treatment for a heart condition, had tested positive for MERS, according to a Reuters report from Bangkok. At a televised news conference the doctor from the Thailand's private hospital said: "The Omani patient came to us tired, coughing ... there was no fever."

"So we X-rayed his chest ... we found that he could have 2 things, a heart condition or the MERS virus," said the doctor.

On testing positive, the infected man was moved to Bangkok's Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute (BIDI) on Thursday [18 Jun 2015]. Staff there were seen wearing and giving out masks to visitors. Health warnings were posted in front of the building's entrance.

The hospital said 58 staff had been quarantined, but all other operations were continuing as normal.

The Omani patient was "getting a bit better", said Thailand's Public Health Minister Rajata Rajatanavin at a press conference on the outskirts of Bangkok.

He said the 2 relatives of the Omani man infected with MERS, were being tested for the deadly virus after one was found to have a cough and the other a fever. "We have taken their samples for laboratory testing," Rajata said.

The infected man arrived in the Thai capital on Monday [15 Jun 2015] on an Oman Air flight for medical treatment for a heart ailment. "It took about 4 days to diagnose this case and 2 lab tests," the minister said, adding all 106 people on board the man's flight had been located.

Meanwhile, the 2nd patient in Abu Dhabi is being treated in hospital and is expected to recover, UAE's state news agency WAM reported. The authority is working with the Ministry of Health and other institutions to investigate the cases and isolate any potential spread of the disease, The National report said.

The Ministry of Health in Oman continues its efforts to monitor and control the diseases by using an effective epidemiological surveillance system and the readiness of the referral hospitals to handle such cases.

It also calls all citizens and residents to adhere with advices and guidance that effectively contribute to overcome a lot of health problems and infections including respiratory diseases, foremost of which are; public hygiene, cleaning hands and following the proper health practices while coughing and sneezing.

MERS was 1st identified in humans in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and the majority of cases have been in the Middle East. Isolated cases have cropped up in Asia before South Korea's outbreak began last month [May 2015], and Thailand is the 4th Asian country to register a case.

The Thai case will compound fears in Asia of a repeat of a 2002-2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed 800 people globally.

In Thailand, authorities were screening passengers from countries seen at risk of MERS and stepping up public information about the virus.

The Middle East is an important source of tourists for Thailand with arrivals from the region up by nearly 50 percent in January, according to the tourism office.

WHO calls for stepping up vigil for MERS, Thailand confirms case
-------------------------
New Delhi, 18 Jun 2015 - WHO calls for stepping up vigil for MERS, Thailand confirms case

Thailand today [18 Jun 2015] confirmed Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS CoV) disease in a traveler from the Middle East region, the 1st case in the WHO South-East Asia Region, as World Health Organization urged countries in the region to step up vigil and review preparedness to respond to the disease.

"Strong health systems using strict infection control measures would be the key to prevent the spread of the virus and protect health-care workers and others", Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director, WHO South-East Asia Region, said.

Earlier in the week, Dr Khetrapal Singh wrote to the Health Ministers of the 11 countries in WHO South-East Asia Region, to review and strengthen preparedness against MERS CoV in view of the recent spread of the disease.

The Regional Director urged the countries to enhance surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections, focus on early diagnosis, and step up infection prevention and control procedures in health-care facilities.

WHO has been working with countries in the Region to build their capacities and strengthen preparedness as required under the International Health Regulations (2005) to effectively detect and respond to outbreaks and other hazards. Efficient application of the available knowledge and prevention and control mechanism, would enable countries to effectively respond and mitigate the risk of spread of MERS CoV, Dr Singh said.

MERS coronavirus disease is caused by a virus. Typical symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. Pneumonia is common, but not always present. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea, have also been reported.

MERS coronavirus (MERS CoV) was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012, from where the majority of cases (>80%) have been reported since then. Since then 1333 cases have been reported from 26 countries.Thailand today confirmed Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS CoV) disease in a traveler from the Middle East region, the first case in the WHO South-East Asia Region, as World Health Organization urged countries in the region to step up vigil and review preparedness to respond to the disease.

[It is interesting to see that the WHO SEARO office had sent out an alert to the member countries before the case in Thailand was identified. Clearly the outbreak in South Korea was a wake-up call globally about the high mobility of people -- the fact that we do live in a global village with constant travel and exchange between people from all countries. - Mod.MPP]

"Five people in Japan who were suspected of being infected with Middle East respiratory syndrome had broken home quarantine in South Korea, health minister Yasuhisa Shiozaki said Thursday [18 Jun 2015]. In South Korea, anyone put under home quarantine after coming into contact with a MERS-infected person or staying in the victim's home or hospital is barred from leaving the country. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said South Korean officials notified Japan that 2 Japanese and 3 South Korean citizens traveled to Japan while under quarantine. The Japanese government monitored the 5 but none showed symptoms of MERS, Suga said. Four have passed the MERS incubation period of 14 days, but the 5th person, as well as another Japanese found to have had contact with one of the 5 while in South Korea, are still being monitored, he added." [Human behavior....but in fairness it was unclear if these individuals were told about quarantine before they left. -Mod.MPP]

Viet Nam
http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/928027.shtml
"Vietnam's Ministry of Health on Friday [19 Jun 2015] denied a rumor of one patient infected with the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in Hanoi. According to a press release, a rumor spreading in a social network stated that the MERS patient, a South Korean who entered Vietnam on [10 Jun 2015], is being isolated for medical treatment in capital Hanoi by the ministry." [If any of our subscribers have more information on this we'd greatly appreciate receiving it. At times social media can alert earlier events, at times it can serve as rumor mongers... - Mod.MPP]

Singapore
http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/928020.shtml
"The Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) will arrive in Singapore sooner or later due to the country's global connectivity, said Singapore's Health Minister Gan Kim Yong on Friday [19 Jun 2015]. Gan's comment echoes with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's remarks on [11 Jun 2015]. Lee thought that it is a "matter of time" before Singapore has its first MERS case due to its inter- connectivity, therefore the city state must get prepared for MERS." [pragmatic and realistic - Mod.MPP]

"Following the 1st case of the potentially deadly Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) being confirmed in Thailand on Thursday [18 Jun 2015], government officials in Cambodia said entry points into the country were already equipped to prevent the disease from spreading here."
