Several cases of human illness with symptoms suggestive of Aujeszky's
Disease (AD) at an outbreak of the disease in cattle and swine were
evaluated during this study. Additionally serological studies of people in
the group at high risk for illness caused by Aujeszky's Disease Virus (ADV)
were carried out. In a herd of 180 bulls sudden clinical disease occurred
with symptoms of muscular tremors, salivation, sweating and severe pruritus
of the head. The clinical disease lasted two to eight hours and finished in
death. In 7 days 10 bulls died and 60 were either killed or culled. A
biological test for AD was positive. ADV was identified in the brain of a
dead bull. Serological studies for the bulls were negative, however 92.9%
on the premises farm were asymptomatically infected.
On third to the fifth day of disease in the cattle clinical signs appeared
in six of seven workers which had direct contact with diseased cattle. A
pruritus of the palms, which spread onto the lower and upper arms, shoulders
and back lasted several days.

[While Aujeszky's is not normally regarded as a zoonotic disease, it would
seem that when there is a severe herd infection, as in this instance, human
cases might be observed. It would seem that virus isolation and confirmation
was not attempted from the 6/7 herdsmen with pruritis. If this risk is real
though slight, it would be of value if members would be aware of it and
record any human symptoms and lesions. As the following posting indicates,
4-H teenagers with pigs would form an ideal sentinel population; for those
outside the USA, "4-H" is a national young farmers club. - Mod.MHJ

PSEUDORABIES OUTBREAKS WILL AFFECT 4-H SWINE SHOWS
Indiana 4-H swine project members should take special care when buying hogs
this year because of scattered pseudorabies outbreaks. Youths will need to
ask important questions and take sanitation precautions when visiting farms
to find project animals.
Hogs can carry it without showing symptoms, which range from none to sudden
death, says Dr. John Johnston of the Indiana Board of Animal Health Swine
Division. Severity depends on a hog's age and immune status. They don't
always die; mostly the babies die, S Johnston says.
Symptoms often can look like other diseases, the animal health board says.
In pigs younger than 3 weeks, incoordination, appetite loss, depression,
vomiting, diarrhea and convulsions may occur, then death of entire litters.
Older pigs often have fever, appetite loss, sneezing, coughing, pneumonia,
convulsions and sometimes blindness. Abortion, stillbirths and mummified
pigs also can occur. It can affect other species, he says, including cattle,
sheep, cats, dogs and wild animals. Signs in these animals are more severe.
The most common symptom is scratching to the point of mutilation, but all
typical swine symptoms also may be seen. False rabies symptoms -- grinding
teeth, excessive salivation and bellowing -- also may arise.
Humans can't get pseudorabies, and there is no danger in eating the meat of
pseudorabies-positive hogs, say veterinarians.
The disease is spread primarily by nose-to-nose contact, Johnston says, but
it also can live for a short time in manure, on gates and other surfaces, so
it can be carried on boots to other pens or farms.
For this reason, all those going from farm to farm should clean their boots
and clothes between farms, says Purdue 4-H Youth Extension specialist Clint
Rusk. There are plastic boots -- almost like baggies -- they can get at
veterinary supply stores to wear over their shoes, he says.
They can wear a clean pair at each farm.
Other recommendations Rusk had for 4-HUers include:
Check with your county Extension educator about special rules for showing
hogs in your county. Find out if your county will have a terminal show,
after which all animals must be sold for slaughter, because you may need to
buy another animal for state fair exhibition.
If you want to show swine at the state fair, get a state fair premium book
after April 1 to check health rules for those shows.
Before buying a hog, make sure it has been tested for pseudorabies (PRV
tested) and has a health certificate.
With few exceptions, hogs vaccinated for pseudorabies in Indiana cannot be
shown or sold. Dr. Cheryl Miller of the animal health board says the vaccine
is very safe, and it hasn't been shown to cause the disease, so the
guidelines are strictly precautionary.
Isolate new hogs from other hogs on farms until they're tested.
Every hog shown in Indiana must be PRV tested. Breeding stock must be tested
within 30 days of exhibition, other swine within 60 days. Animals without
paperwork won't be allowed at the fairgrounds.
The PRV test is performed for free at the Animal Disease Diagnostic Lab at
Purdue. The test charts go from here to the Board of Animal Health to the
office of the vet who drew the sample, then to the farm. And verification of
non-negative samples requires additional lab testing time, says Karen Crane,
serology supervisor at the lab.
In counties without terminal shows, Johnston says, good timing may help
eliminate the need for retests between the county and state fairs. He also
says hogs coming from validated-qualified herds, which are tested more often
than is required, don't need individual tests.
For more information on pseudorabies and state exhibition guidelines, call
(317) 227-0310. Contact your county 4-H Extension educator for information
about your county fair requirements.
