A measles alert has been issued by health officials in Auckland
---------------------------------------------------------------
An international passenger who arrived in the city on 31 Oct 2008 on
a Qantas flight has been diagnosed with English measles [another name
for rubeola (regular measles) whereas another name for rubella is
German measles - Mod.MPP ], prompting the alert.

Medical Officer of Health Sheryl Jury says immunisation means measles
infection is rare in Auckland - but it could spread rapidly in groups
that are not immunised. Dr Jury says any travellers on Qantas flight
QF 043 that day, or their family members, who have symptoms
suggestive of measles should immediately seek advice from a doctor.

Typical symptoms are initial fever, runny nose and sore eyes,
followed by a red blotchy rash. Measles can also sometimes cause
pneumonia and inflammation of the brain.

[Qantas flight 043 originated in Sydney, Australia. While the
affected passenger is referred to as an "international passenger" the
natioinality and possible locations of exposure to measles was not
mentioned. What is mentioned is that the affected passenger had been
diagnosed after arrival in New Zealand. Measles is an acute, highly
communicable disease. Measles virus is transmitted by direct contact
with infectious droplets or, less commonly, by airborne spread. The
incubation period of measles from exposure to rash onset is generally
14 days (range 7-18). Patients are usually contagious from 4 days
before until 4 days after the onset of the rash. Therefore travellers
on flight 043 and any other preceding intercontinental flights
carrying the infected passenger are at risk of contracting measles
infection if they have never been vaccinated, or are
immuno-compromised for any reason.

Persons who are potentially infectious with measles should especially
avoid public transportation (including commercial airlines) and
crowded indoor areas. Patients who suspect they may have measles
should call ahead before visiting a clinic or hospital so that
arrangements may be made for the health-care provider to attend to
the patient without exposing others in the facility to measles.

Most passengers in these flights are likely to be immune to measles
virus infection if they have received 2 doses of the measles, mumps,
and rubella (MMR) vaccine or were born before 1966 (that is, are
likely to have been naturally exposed to measles virus infection
during their earlier lives and be immune to reinfection). Some of
those born after 1966 may have escaped MMR vaccination and remain susceptible.

It might be relevant to extend the New Zealand alert to cover other
possible common exposure points visited by this individual where
transmission of disease may have taken place. - Mods.CP/MPP]
