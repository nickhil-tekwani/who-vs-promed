The pertussis outbreak that was first detected on the West Coast in May 2011 is now being experienced in other areas of the country, including in Canterbury, Nelson-Marlborough, and parts of the North Island. The number of new cases on the West Coast has decreased from the peak in 2011 but is still higher than normal levels.

Between 1 May 2011 and 22 Jun 2012, there have been 497 notifications of suspected pertussis received by Community & Public Health's West Coast Office. To date, 328 people have been confirmed as having the disease. The difference between the number of notifications and the numbers of confirmed cases indicates that general practices are being vigilant when patients present with a cough of more than 2 weeks' duration. Children under the age of 10 years continue to have the highest rates of the disease.

In the winter school holidays there may be more Coasters traveling or visitors to the region so the risk of coming into contact with the disease, or it being "imported" to the Coast is higher. People who are unwell should avoid going to sports events, concerts, or other large gatherings where there is a possibility that they may pass on their illness to others.

"The best protection against pertussis is for babies and children to receive their childhood vaccinations on time," says Dr Cheryl Brunton, West Coast medical officer of health.

[It is not clear how many of the cases have occurred in the high risk group, infants under 6 months of age. The commonest complications of pertussis infection, especially in young infants, include apnea (stopping breathing), pneumonia, and weight loss secondary to feeding difficulties and post-coughing vomiting. Seizures and death also occur. Other complications include difficulty sleeping, pneumothorax, nose bleeds, subconjunctival hemorrhage, intracranial hematoma, rectal prolapse, urinary incontinence, and rib fracture. The overall complication rate of pertussis is 5-6 per cent, but among infants younger than 6 months, the complication rate can be 3-4 times that number.

Recommendations on the use of "cocooning" acellular pertussis vaccines have been developed in an attempt to expand protection in susceptibles to prevent the substantial morbidity and mortality in infants who have not yet been adequately immunized. The now recommended use of the vaccine in pregnant women further expands these recommendations.

Susceptibility of older children and adults to pertussis, usually manifesting as chronic cough without the typical "whoop", after appropriate primary immunization continues to be increasingly reported. Research by both Dr Frits R Mooi from the Netherlands (Pertussis - Australia (04): newly emerging clones, discussion 20120322.1078115) and Dr Lyn Gilbert from Australia (Pertussis - Australia (03): newly emerging clones 20120321.1076103) has been highlighted in ProMED-mail. This phenomenon reflects antigenic changes in circulating clones of _Bordetella pertussis_, which may be causing the increased number of pertussis cases throughout the world. If so, these changes may result in a need for modifications to the currently used acellular pertussis vaccines, and without these modifications, selection and further spread of clones not as protected for by the vaccine will continue to increase. - Mod.LL
