A Kyoto resident in his 60's died of rabies on his return to Japan after a
stray dog bit his hand in the Philippines, the Public Health and Welfare
Bureau in Kyoto announced on Fri 17 Nov 2006. The man, who fell into a coma
before his death, was the first Japanese to be diagnosed with the virus in
36 years, the Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry said.
According to the ministry, the man was bitten by the dog at the end of
August [2006] and returned to Japan on 1 Nov 2006. He visited a doctor in
Kyoto on 9 Nov 2006 with cold [flu-like?] symptoms before developing
characteristic signs of rabies such as hallucinations and a fear of water
and wind.
The National Institute of Infectious Diseases diagnosed the man with rabies
after testing his saliva.

[Akira Goto has provided the following additional information translated
from a press release in Japanese from the Ministry of Health, Labour and
Welfare (<http://www.mhlw.go.jp/houdou/2006/11/h1116-2.html>). "The 1970
human case was also an imported case from Nepal; the most recent domestic
human and canine rabies cases in Japan were reported in 1954 and 1956,
respectively."
ProMED-mail greatly appreciates Akira Goto's initiative in providing this
information. - Mod.CP]
