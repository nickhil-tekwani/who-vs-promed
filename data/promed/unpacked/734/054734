Veterinary consultation regarding the deaths of the giraffes has
produced the following *work up*.
Case info: 5 of 6 giraffes dead. Clinical signs include shortness of
breath, abdominal distention and weakness, bile (?) from the snout and
poisoning suspected.
What has often appeared as "intentional poisoning" in cases seen with
cows (giraffes are essentially tall cows) has usually been a management
change where a new substance, feed (or dietary supplement or schedule),
or environmental toxin has been unintentionally introduced to animals,
especially when transferred from one facility to another.
Given the few signs from the posting, more unanswered questions than
answers were generated. Urea toxicity or D*lactic acidosis seems more
likely than poisoning.
Urea Toxicity Information as compiled from Osweiler, G., 1996. The
National Veterinary Medical Series: Toxicology. pp. 341-344. Williams
and Wilkins Press. Philadelphia. Nonprotein nitrogen products (NPN) are
added to the feed of ruminants to provide up to 40% of their protein
nitrogen requirements. NPN major ingredients are urea or urea phosphate.
NPN products are available as dry supplements for mixing into rations.
Range blocks or range cubes can also contain urea. Lick tanks used in
pasture conditions contain liquid supplements. Toxicosis usually occurs
as a result of variability or excesses in urea intake and lack of
ruminal adaptation to non-protein nitrogen. The major metabolite of urea
is ammonia. The release of ammonia is stimulated by ruminal microflora
and urease. Ammonia is a short-lived product in blood and is rapidly
converted in the urea cycle and excreted unless blood ammonia level is
excessive. The release of excess ammonia in the rumen leads to
hyperammonemia because the microbial population of the rumen is unable
to utilize the ammonia at the high levels and thus it is absorbed into
the blood. Excess ammonia is toxic to enzymes of the TCA [tricarboxylic
acid cycle, resulting in metabolic acidosis. Death probably results
from lactic acidemia and hyperkalemic heart failure.
Predisposing factors for urea toxicosis:
1) Fasting -- causes loss of energy needed by ruminal microbes to
metabolize the urea.
2) High roughage (i.e., low energy) diets
3) High ruminal pH -- promotes ammonia in a un-ionized form and
increases absorption.
4) Dehydration or low water intake.
5) Hepatic insufficiency-causing inability to metabolize urea
6) Lack of natural protein-may be required in small amounts for the
rumen microbes to utilize ammonia
Factors that enhance toxicity:
1) Plant urease -- (e. g., from raw soybeans) may enhance the hydrolysis
of urea.
2) Alkaline condition of the rumen.
Diagnosis and Clinical Signs include: acute onset of signs usually
occurs within 0.5-0.6 hours after ingestion. Early signs include frothy
salivation, teeth grinding, abdominal pain, polyuria [frequent
urination, muscle tremors, incoordination, and weakness follow rapidly.
Advanced signs of toxicosis are recumbency (usually forequarters first).
Polypnea [rapid breathing, bloat, and regurgitation of rumen contents
are serious indications of advanced toxicosis. (It should be noted that
"regurgitation" is usually only of rumen contents from the first [part
of the stomach [the rumen. What may appear to be regurgitated bile is
likely rumen contents combined with drastically increased salivation or
mucous production. Hyperthermia, anuria [no urine production and
cyanosis [turning blue may occur prior to death. Laboratory evaluation
would indicate decreased blood pH (metabolic acidosis) and elevations in
blood glucose, blood lactic acid, serum potassium, blood ammonia levels,
and rumen pH.
Treatment:
----------
1. Ruminal infusion of cold water and acetic acid should be repeated
every 6 hours for up to 48 hours. Best results are obtained if the
animal is still ambulatory. Cold water may dilute the urea and lower the
ruminal temperature. Acetic acid (5%) or vinegar may lower rumen pH and
decrease ruminal temperature.
2. Ruminal intubation (used to relieve bloat)
3. Intravenous administration of normal saline with bicarbonate or
lactate may help to combat metabolic acidosis.
4. Rumenotomy-if an animal will tolerate surgery, rumenotomy may be
helpful to remove excessive amounts of contaminated feed.
