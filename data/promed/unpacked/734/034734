- 19:00 GMT - USA
Florida has reported a record 1-day rise in coronavirus deaths and cases in Texas passed the 400 000 mark, stoking fears the US was losing control of the outbreak and adding pressure on Congress to pass another massive aid package. Florida had 191 coronavirus deaths in the past 24 hours, the highest single-day rise since the start of the epidemic, the state health department said. Texas, the 2nd-most populous state, added more than 6000 new cases on Monday [27 Jul 2020), pushing its total to 401 477, according to a Reuters tally. Only 3 other states -- California, Florida, and New York -- have more than 400 000 total cases.

[The saga continues in states that lifted restrictions prematurely and have not placed uniform restrictions to ensure mask wearing and social distancing. In the early increases, the mortality remained low as the average age of cases was lower than experienced in the early outbreaks. The mortality is increasing as the age of infected cases increases. California has now reported the most cases (474 819), followed by Florida (441 977), New York (441 262), and Texas (414 877) (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/) - Mod.MPP

- 18:28 GMT - Ecuador
Authorities in Ecuador are deploying new sanitary mobile centers to ramp up testing and ease pressure on the health system. Quito has become Ecuador's COVID-19 hotspot, with total cases recently overtaking those in Guayaquil, the country's 2nd-largest city, which in March and April [2020] suffered one of Latin America's worst outbreaks. Quito now has 12 747 cases, with Ecuador's total case count exceeding 82 000, according to figures released by the Health Ministry on Tuesday [28 Jul 2020]. Some 600 people have died in the capital, out of 5584 deaths across the Andean nation.

[We posted on the surge outbreak in Guayaquil (COVID-19 update (129): China, S. Korea & high local transmission countries, Ecuador 20200425.7265865). Guayaquil is a coastal city at sea level. Quito is in the Andes, at 2850 meters (9350 feet) above sea level.

- 18:15 GMT - USA (New York)
New York's governor says he is "appalled" by videos showing crowds standing close together at a Hamptons concert featuring electronic music duo The Chainsmokers over the weekend [25-26 Jul 2020]. Governor Andrew Cuomo said the state Department of Health will investigate "egregious social distancing violations".

[New York state is taking enforcement of social distancing and mask wearing seriously, with a Governor who knows if violations are permitted New York may very well return to being the epicenter of the pandemic in the USA. - Mod.MPP]

- 17:45 GMT - Portugal (Madeira)
Wearing masks in public will be compulsory at all times on the popular Portuguese island of Madeira from [1 Aug 2020], the local government has announced on Tuesday [28 Jul 2020], making it the 1st region in the country to adopt such a measure. Madeira, popular for its wine and green landscape, has managed to keep its tally of coronavirus cases low since the pandemic started. It has reported 105 infections, with no new cases since Saturday [25 Jul 2020]. "The use of the mask is exactly to show those who visit us the reason why we have these results," said the region's general health secretary, Pedro Ramos. The use of masks in closed spaces and public transport is already compulsory in Madeira but now those on the streets must wear masks too.

[Smart decisions. With the impending European vacation month (August), idyllic islands will be at high risk from partiers and folks tired of the regulations where they live, and ready to party freely. Good luck, Europe. - Mod.MPP

- 17:19 GMT - France
French health authorities have reported 14 new deaths, taking the total to 30 223, a figure twice as high as the daily average increase of 7 seen over the last week. In a statement, authorities said the number of people in hospital for COVID-19 went down again, pursuing a 2-month downward trend.

[There have been signs of increased transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 in France over the past few weeks. This is just another one of those signs. - Mod.MPP

- 17:03 GMT - USA (Georgia)
Georgia Governor Brian Kemp has withdrawn his emergency request for a court to stop enforcement of Atlanta's requirement that faces masks be worn in all public places, while mediation over the state's legal effort to block the mandate proceeds. Kemp sued Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and the city 2 weeks ago to stop enforcement of the local mandate, aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus. The governor argued that the city lacks the authority to override his order encouraging but not requiring face coverings.

[For people living outside of the USA, it's important to get a glimpse of some stupidities ongoing. The value of face masks in reducing transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 is not controversial in scientific circles. Unfortunately, science hasn't found a cure for stupidity. - Mod.MPP]

- 16:50 GMT - Italian PM seeks to extend emergency period
Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has asked parliament to extend a state of emergency, which expands his government's powers. Opposition parties objected that Conte was trying to keep too much power in his own hands despite a dramatic fall in the rate of contagion. "The virus continues to evolve and has not run its course. It would be incongruous to abruptly suspend such an effective measure," Conte told the upper house, the Senate. However, he drew back from requesting an extension until the end of the year [2020], saying he only wanted a renewal until October [2020].

[Italy has been showing signs of increased transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 over the past few weeks with increasing 7 day averages. Restrictions were lifted over 2 months ago, but summertime has hit, and outdoor gatherings are occurring. The challenges when a population thinks lifting of restrictions means the virus has disappeared. - Mod.MPP

- 16:46 GMT - Malta
Malta's health ministry has said 65 migrants who were in a group of 94 people rescued at sea and brought to Malta on Monday [27 Jul 2020] have tested positive for COVID-19. It was the single largest cluster of positive cases detected on the Mediterranean island since the 1st case came to light in the country on [7 Mar 2020]. The health ministry said 85 of the migrants had been tested so far, with a further 9 still awaiting a test.

[What is not mentioned is the proportion of the positive individuals who were asymptomatic, and if the tests done were PCR or serology. Nor is there mention of countries of origin of these migrants as an indication of possible unidentified high levels of transmission in these countries.- Mod.MPP

- 15:12 GMT - Belarus
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has said he has had the coronavirus without any symptoms and had already recovered from it, the BelTA news agency has quoted him as saying. "Today, you are meeting a man who managed to survive the coronavirus on his feet. Doctors came to such a conclusion yesterday [27 Jul 2020]. Asymptomatic," Lukashenko said during a meeting with the military. The 65-year-old leader has resisted calls to impose lockdown measures or close the borders to contain the spread of the pandemic in the eastern European country.

[No comment. - Mod.MPP

- 14:38 GMT - Lebanon
Lebanon has agreed to reinforce nationwide lockdown measures after a spike in new cases threatens to overwhelm its healthcare system. On Saturday [25 Jul 2020], Lebanon recorded 175 new cases, its highest daily number of infections. To stem a larger outbreak, the government ordered a lockdown from [30 Jul 2020] until [3 Aug 2020], Information Minister Manal Abdel Samad said after a cabinet meeting. The lockdown will be suspended from [3 Aug 202] until [6 Aug 2020], with restaurants and cafes allowed to reopen at 50 percent capacity while nightclubs, bars, indoor pools and public parks remain closed. Lebanon, a country of some 6 million people, has recorded a total of 3879 cases of COVID-19, including 51 deaths.

[As of today 28 Jul 2020, there have been a total of 4023 cases of COVID-19 including 54 deaths reported by Lebanon, an increase of 441 newly confirmed cases since Saturday's [25 Jul 2020] report of 3582 cases. Impressive is the cumulative total number of cases reported by Lebanon on 1 Jul 2020 was 1788 (Data from https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries, and our spreadsheet of daily Worldometer data. - Mod.MPP

- 14:03 GMT - Turkey
Turkey plans to reopen schools nationwide on [31 Aug 2020], to get students back into classrooms and free up working parents, assuming a recent stabilisation in coronavirus cases holds. Teachers and administrators are preparing on-site health precautions, but 2 government sources told Reuters that the daily infection rate may need to dip below the more than 900 seen recently to allow them to execute what they called Plan A. Schools shifted to distance education in March [2020], when Turkey identified its 1st case and began restricting movement.

[Good luck. The opening of schools has become a controversial topic globally, in terms of the safety implications for the educational staff and the families of the school children. Children do get infected, and do transmit to their families, especially those over age 10 (see COVID-19 update (325): reinfection, child transm, selected countries, WHO, global 20200720.7592025 for more information.) - Mod.MPP

- 13:50 GMT - Global air traffic
World air traffic will not return to levels seen before the coronavirus pandemic until at least 2024, the International Air Transport Association has said. Uncertainty about the timing of border reopenings is the main factor weighing on international traffic, IATA's finance chief Brian Pearce told a news conference.

[The airline industry is one of the collateral damages of the pandemic with flights shut down between areas with ongoing active SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The projection of 2024 seems more realistic than other projections, as painful as it may sound. - Mod.MPP]

- 12:00 GMT - Southern Africa
Nearly 45 million people in 13 countries in southern Africa are food-insecure as a result of drought and flood and the impact of coronavirus, the region's bloc has said. The tally has risen almost 10 percent over last year [2019], the Southern African Development Community (SADC) said in a report. "Common climate-induced shocks ... economic challenges and poverty have been further exacerbated by the devastating impact of COVID-19 on communities," it said. Coronavirus restrictions have badly affected business activity, jobs, and remittances.

[This is a major collateral damage associated with the pandemic, not only in Southern Africa but globally. - Mod.MPP

- 11:45 GMT - Spain (Madrid)
The Madrid regional government is making the wearing of face masks mandatory in all public areas, limiting how many people can gather in one place, and targeting young people in a drive to stamp out new outbreaks of the coronavirus. Regional government head Isabel Diaz Ayuso announced that no more than 10 people can be present at private gatherings. Ayuso also said an information campaign will focus on young people, who are largely blamed for spreading the coronavirus through their social lives. She said young people "have it in their hands to reverse the trend".

[A common thread in areas where restrictions have been lifted or eased. Youths are invincible, and in the peak of their social existences. Unfortunately they are not all invincible, nor are their family members or co-workers. - Mod.MPP

- 11:30 GMT - Greece
Greece has announced it will open 6 of its big ports to tourist cruise ships starting on Saturday [1 Aug 2020], after they were banned because of the coronavirus pandemic. "All cruisers are welcome in Greece," Tourism Minister Haris Theocharis said on Tuesday [28 Jul 2020]. The country is to open the ports in Athens, Rhodes, Heraklion on Crete, Volos, Corfu, and Katakolon, he added.

[As to short term memory loss... have the experiences on the Diamond Princess and other cruise ships been forgotten?.....- Mod.MPP

- 11:15 GMT - WHO: SARS-CoV-2 not seasonal
The spread of the novel coronavirus does not appear to be impacted by seasonality, the World Health Organization has said, warning against false beliefs that summer is safer. "Season does not seem to be affecting the transmission of this virus," WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris told reporters in a virtual briefing. She pointed out that some of the hardest-hit countries are currently in the middle of different seasons.

For those saying the coronavirus will go away during the summer, check the statistics in Catalonia Spain, or Florida, Texas, and California in the USA, to mention a few locations. - Mod.MPP]

- 10:45 GMT - South Asian animal sellers go online for Eid al-Adha
Millions of goats, sheep, and cattle are slaughtered annually during Eid al-Adha -- the festival of sacrifice -- one of 2 major holy days observed by Muslims across the world, including some 600 million in South Asia. The pandemic has, however, badly hit India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan, which have shut or heavily restricted major markets, while fears of catching the virus are keeping customers away ahead of the main festival on Saturday [1 Aug 2020]. Faced with deserted markets, livestock breeders and traders have turned to websites, apps, and social media to showcase their animals.

[Another example of collateral damage, with clever approaches to overcome the barriers... - Mod.MPP]

- 10:15 GMT - Pakistan
Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan has warned citizens to continue to strictly follow government guidelines on limiting interactions, warning of a possible new surge in cases after the Islamic holy day of Eid al-Adha later this week. Khan's warning came as the country registered its lowest single-day rise in cases in almost 3 months, according to the latest government data.

[Case numbers have been decreasing, as has the percent of positive tests performed; unfortunately the upcoming holiday later on this week may reverse some of these gains if there are large family gatherings. - Mod.MPP

- 10:00 GMT - Papua New Guinea
Australia said it was sending a medical team to help Papua New Guinea fight an outbreak of coronavirus after the neighbouring country experienced a rise in infections. The Pacific nation, which had escaped the infection levels of its neighbours since the crisis escalated in March [2020], has recorded an increase in new cases in the past week, according to data analysis firm Worldometer. There were 62 confirmed virus cases as of late Tuesday [28 Jul 2020], up from just 8 infections 11 days ago.

[In the past 5 days cases have almost doubled from 32 on Fri 24 Jul 2020 to 63 on Tue 28 Jul 2020 (data from https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries - Mod.MPP

- 09:00 GMT - Germany
The rapid rise in Germany's coronavirus numbers is very worrying, the country's Robert Koch Institute for disease control said on Tuesday [28 Jul 2020], urging citizens to keep their distance and wear face masks. "We must prevent that the virus once again spreads rapidly and uncontrollably," RKI head Lothar Wieler told reporters. "The latest developments in the number of COVID-19 cases is of great concern to me and all of us at the RKI," he said. Separately, Germany's foreign ministry updated its travel advisory, recommending against travel to 3 regions in northern Spain grappling with renewed outbreaks.

[A summary of the latest situation in Germany from RKI is available at https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Situationsberichte/2020-07-28-en.pdf?__blob=publicationFile. Cumulative case count now 206 242 laboratory confirmed cases including 9122 deaths. Outbreak in Bavaria among harvest workers with more than 150 cases; increases in daily case counts occurring over past week; clusters related to large family events, leisure activities, occupational settings, in community and health facilities and increasingly from people returning from abroad.

- 08:45 GMT - Kenya
Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta has extended a nightly curfew and banned alcohol sales in restaurants as part of a bid to halt a steep rise in coronavirus cases. In a stern televised address to the nation on Monday [27 Jul 2020], Kenyatta said a countrywide curfew from 9pm to 4am will remain in place for another 30 days and that "there shall be no sale of alcoholic beverages or drinks in eateries and restaurants" over the same period.

[Kenya has rightly identified excessive alcohol consumption is linked to non-observance of social distancing and use of face masks, the key preventive strategies available now for COVID-19. As of today 28 Jul 2020, there have been 18 581 cases including 299 deaths reported by Kenya, having almost tripled since 1 Jul 2020 when the cumulative count was 6673 (data from https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries and our spreadsheet). - Mod.MPP

Indonesia has reported 1748 new coronavirus infections, bringing its tally to 102 051 confirmed cases overall, health ministry data showed. The number of deaths in the Southeast Asian nation related to COVID-19 rose by 63, bringing the total to 4901.

[While India is the powerhouse in terms of daily reported cases in the South East Asia region, Indonesia has been reporting around 1000 cases a day since 9 Jun 2020, with the cumulative case count almost doubling since 1 Jul 2020 when it was 57 770 and today's cumulative count at 102 051 (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries). - Mod.MPP

- 08:00 GMT - Taiwan
Taiwan is investigating its 1st possible local coronavirus infection in more than a month, a Thai man who tested positive last week [week of 20 Jul 2020], as the island also faces a rise in cases brought from overseas. Taiwan's early response was effective in keeping the pandemic at bay, with just 467 infections and 7 deaths. Most of the cases have been imported and have recovered. Until the Thai man's positive test, the island had not seen a local case of coronavirus infection since [24 Jun 2020].

[Taiwan has been one of the countries that has managed to succeed in limiting local transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 through intensive contact tracing, testing, and isolation. Communicating with colleagues in Taiwan, a fear is that it will catch up with them as has occurred in Singapore and Hong Kong to name a few places. If that fear will prevent complacency, this track record may hold. Obviously there are concerns of a local case, a sign of possible community transmission with an unidentifiable transmission chain. - Mod.MPP

- 07:45 GMT - Pakistan
The number of infections has dropped below 1000 for the 1st time in 3 months in Pakistan. The country counted 936 new cases reported in the last 24 hours throughout the country of 220 million people. Dr Zafar Mirza, special assistant to Prime Minister Imran Khan, tweeted praise for Khan, urging Pakistanis to wear masks as the "most effective practice to reduce the transmission of the disease."

- 07:30 GMT - Russia
Russia has reported 5395 new cases of the novel coronavirus, bringing its nationwide tally to 823 515, the 4th largest in the world. Russia's coronavirus taskforce said 150 people had died over the last 24 hours, pushing the official death toll in the country of around 145 million people to 13 504.

[Reporting of 5395 newly confirmed cases by Russia is a major improvement. On 1 Jul 2020, Russia reported 6556 newly confirmed cases, 8248 new cases on 18 Jun 2020, 9035 cases on 1 Jun 2020... a trend for decreasing daily case confirmations (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries). - Mod.MPP

- 07:15 GMT - South Africa
South Africa is closing in on a half-million confirmed coronavirus cases as the country posted nearly 300 deaths in a single day. South Africa now has 452 529 cases and 7067 deaths, making up more than half the reported cases on the African continent. It has the 5th-highest caseload in the world. Like many others, the country has struggled with trying to ease lockdown restrictions and then seeing cases rise. But businesses have expressed frustration as unemployment is now above 30 percent and likely to keep increasing.

[South Africa has been the dominant country reporting cases in the African region. Cumulative case counts have tripled since 1 Jul 2020 when there were 159 333 cases, with daily case counts exceeding 10 000 staring on 9 Jul 2020.

- 05:00 GMT - Philippines
The Red Cross in the Philippines is urging people to be more vigilant as COVID-19 cases in the country jump by more than 1000 each day, and an increasing number of hospitals are reporting they can no longer accommodate more patients. More than 80 000 people have been diagnosed with COVID-19, with more than 42 000 cases confirmed in July [2020]. "The biggest threat is complacency as we are far from being out of the woods," Philippine Red Cross Chairman Richard Gordon said in a statement. "We need to act like we already have the virus and keep wearing face masks and practising proper handwashing and physical distancing."

[The Philippines is the dominant country in the Western Pacific region in terms of daily case counts (see section [3] below). The cumulative case count has more than doubled since 1 Jul 2020 when it was 38 511, to today's count of 83 673.

- 02:50 GMT - Australia (Melbourne, Victoria)
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has cut short an interstate tour because of what he says is a "very complex" outbreak of coronavirus in nursing homes in the southern city of Melbourne, likely transmitted to them through the people working in the facilities. Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews has said 769 cases have been linked to nursing homes. "I cannot stand here and tell you that I have confidence that staff and management across a number of private-sector aged care facilities are able to provide the care that is appropriate to keep their residents safe," Andrews told reporters.

[See below for details of the situation in Melbourne, the capital of Victoria. Outbreaks in nursing homes have been a common occurrence during this pandemic, carrying with them high morbidity and mortality as the residents tend to be older ages with multiple pre-existing co-morbidities. - Mod.MPP

- 00:30 GMT - Peru
Peru says more than 900 girls and women are feared to have died as a result of domestic violence during the country's extended coronavirus lockdown; some 70 percent of those missing were under the age of 18. "During the quarantine from [16 Mar 2020] to [30 Jun 2020], 915 women in Peru were reported missing," and feared dead, Elionar Revollar, the head of the women's rights office of the National Ombudsman was quoted as saying by AFP. The number of women reported missing each day has risen to 8 compared with 5 before the pandemic.

00:15 GMT - UN: wasting, stunting
The UN says nearly 7 million more children will suffer stunting as a result of the coronavirus pandemic affecting food supplies. Writing in The Lancet, a team of experts modelled the impact on 118 poor and middle-income countries and found the prevalence of moderate or severe wasting among children under 5 would increase by 14.3 percent, or an extra 6.7 million cases. Wasting occurs when the body is so malnourished that muscles and fat begin to disappear.

[Food insecurity was present prior to the pandemic, but the number of families experiencing food insecurity related to the pandemic and loss of livelihoods is frightening. Especially with the impact on children. - Mod.MPP]

[These countries had been selected based on having had significant surges with SARS-CoV-2 infections but different responses. In some cases, transmission was almost interrupted, but resurgences have occurred, and countries have handled them differently. One observation is that lifting of restrictions has led to major resurgences in some areas; in others, early new threats seem to be importations, but community spread does recur. Good contact tracing has helped to shorten the time with new clusters and temporary new restrictions have had an impact. Countries not implementing restrictions have done more poorly, with major resurgences. Spain has been added again as it is dealing with a 2nd wave after lifting of restrictions, primarily focused in Catalonia and Aragon. - Mod.MPP]

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 28 Jul 2020.

Highlights
----------
- WHO has published an interim guidance on Considerations for implementing mass treatment, active case‐ finding and population-based surveys for neglected tropical diseases in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The document proposes a 2-step approach: a risk-benefit assessment, to decide if the planned neglected tropical diseases activity should proceed, and a review of a list of precautionary measures, to decide how the planned activity should be implemented.

- Ethiopia vaccinates nearly 15 million children against measles despite COVID-19 challenges. The campaign's target was 15 million children and it attained 96% coverage (14.4 million), showing that even with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, countries can continue to carry out life-saving mass vaccinations.

- The WHO Regional Office for the Americas and the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) launched the "Stronger Together" campaign to assist communities in promoting mental wellbeing and positive coping strategies during times of stress and crisis. The awareness campaign will run until November 2020 and includes a range of promotional materials and media.

- Today's 'Subject in Focus' provides an update on Infodemics management.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:

- The Americas region reported 52.4% of the global newly reported cases and 53.3% of newly reported deaths for this 24-hour period, maintaining its dominance as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 8.7 million cases. The USA reported 51.8% of cases (61 498), Brazil 20.7% (24 578), Colombia 6.9% (8181), Mexico 4.6% (5480), Peru 4.1% (4913), Argentina 3.5% (4205), and Chile 1.8% (2133).

- The European region reported 11.6% of the global newly reported cases and 8.9% of the newly confirmed deaths globally. Spain reported 24.2% (6361) of the regional newly confirmed cases, followed by Russia 20.5% (5395), France 8.6% (2254), Kazakhstan 5.8% (1526), Romania 4.2% (1104), Israel 3.9% (1037), Ukraine 3.5% (919), Turkey 3.5% (919), Uzbekistan 2.6% (686), the UK 2.6% (685), Kyrgyzstan 2.1% (548), and Germany 2.4% (633). Note that France and Spain did not report over the weekend so today's (28 Jul 2020) may reflect catch-up reporting.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 5.5% of the global newly reported cases and 10.6% of global newly reported fatalities. Iraq reported 20.6% (2553), of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Iran 19.7% (2434), Saudi Arabia 16.1% (1993), Oman 8.5% (1053), Pakistan 7.6% (936), Morocco 4.9% (609), Kuwait 4.9% (606), and Egypt 3.4% (420). Pakistan is decreasing its daily case count steadily during the month of July 2020 (on 1 Jul 2020, Pakistan reported 4133 newly confirmed cases), while at the same time cases are increasing in Iraq, Oman and Morocco. This region remains highly active, with multiple countries still in a surge mode.

- The African region reported 5.8% of the global newly reported cases and 8.6% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 53.8% (7097) of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Kenya 10.1% (1332), Ghana 9.0% (1187), Nigeria 4.9% (648), Algeria 4.7 (616), Ethiopia 4.4% (579), and Madagascar 3.0% (395). Since the beginning of July 2020, South Africa has reported daily new case counts of greater than 10 000, 18 of the 28 days, today's (28 Jul 2020) report is a major reduction from yesterday's 11 233 (27 Jul 2020).

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.7% of the global newly reported cases and 0.63% of global deaths. The Philippines reported 41.4% (1592) of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Japan 25.3% (972), Australia 13.8% (532), Singapore 12.2% (469), China 5.6% (217), and South Korea 0.73% (28).

- The South East Asia region reported 23.0% of the global newly reported cases and 18.1% of global deaths. India reported 91.3% (47 703) of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 5.3% (2772) and Indonesia 2.9% (1525). India continues to be the driving force of the dominance of this region.

Impression: The overall picture is basically the same. The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed cases on a daily basis followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, followed by the Africa region and the Western Pacific region representing the lowest daily caseload of all the regions.

[Comparing today's numbers with yesterday's (26 Jul 2020), the global case count rose by 1.5% in the past 24 hours. The USA and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts, although India has been rapidly increasing, with daily case counts around 50 000. At the rate of daily reporting, globally will most likely pass the 17 million mark tomorrow (29 Jul 2020).

In the past 24 hours, the USA reported 64 933 cases, followed by India (49 632), and Brazil (41 169). These 3 countries account for half of all confirmed cases globally (50.4%). There were 6929 deaths reported in the past 24 hours.

In descending rank order, the USA is number one for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by India, Brazil, Colombia, South Africa, Mexico, Argentina, Russia, Peru, Bangladesh, all known global hotspots. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed cases goes from 2960 to 64 933. Other hotspots are seen in the countries numbered 11-20 in this list: Iraq, Iran, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Chile, Spain, Indonesia, Philippines, Kazakhstan and Romania, and their range of reported new cases is 1151 to 2747.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase of 10.0%, and looking at daily reported deaths, the change is increased by 14.9%.

Impression: The SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts and mortality. That being said, the most severely affected region is still the Americas with cases increasing on a daily basis, even though the comparative 7-day average suggests things may be slowing down (or reporting is slowing down). - Mod.MPP]
