New sex disease diagnosed in Stockholm
--------------------------------------
A virulent form of chlamydia that has infected hundreds of men in the USA
and Europe has appeared for the 1st time in Sweden. Dagens Nyheter (a
Swedish newspaper) reports that 3 cases of lymphogranuloma venereum, or
LGV, have so far been diagnosed in Stockholm.
The disease is caused by a strain of chlamydia and is commonest in parts of
Asia, Africa, and South and Central America. In Europe and North America
the bacterial infection has started to spread among gay men, with the
Netherlands and France both reporting around 150 cases each, and the UK
around 30 cases.
Early symptoms of the disease include genital ulcers and tender glands
around the groin. LGV also causes rectal or anal inflammation, scarring and
narrowing. Those diagnosed in Sweden had been suffering with [rectal -
Mod.LL] pain and bleeding for some time before being diagnosed.
The disease is treated by a 3 week course of antibiotics. Left untreated,
it can cause lasting damage to lymph glands and lymph ducts. This can lead
to tissues in the penis and legs of the infected person becoming deformed,
and chronic scarring can form around the anus. Most of those diagnosed with
LGV in the Netherlands were gay men, and were typically HIV positive and
had had anonymous sex with many partners, making it difficult to trace
other men who might be infected.
The disease has an incubation period of a month, meaning that infected
people might have time to have sex with many other people before they
experience symptoms.
The Venhalsan gay sexual health clinic in Stockholm now routinely tests all
men with rectal chlamydia for LGV. The clinic intends to analyze the
results of the tests to see if there has been a more widespread outbreak.
