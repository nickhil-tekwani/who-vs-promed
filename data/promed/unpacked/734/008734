[In many ways, it is useful epidemiologically to look at parts of West
Africa, particularly the stretch along the coast from Ghana to Nigeria, as
being a quasi catchment area for certain animal diseases. Avian influenza
certainly falls into this category because of the traffic in people and
animals crossing the border between Ghana and Togo or Nigeria and Benin.

In fact, there were 4 recent outbreaks in Nigeria (Gombe, Kebbe, Kano,
Katsina), and it is important to intensively follow up this Benin outbreak
in a comparative fashion to see whether there is a common risk factor for
the reintroduction of avian influenza after months of no disease reports.
It is important to establish whether there is new virus circulation, since
the disease was reported on 4 farms last year in November and December 2007.

In Togo, there was one outbreak in June 2007, and there were 2 in July
2007. In Ghana, there were 2 outbreaks in April, 3 in May and one in June
2007. Of course, there were several outbreak farms in Nigeria in the summer
of 2007. Given that now we have cases in both Nigeria and Benin in July and
August 2008, it will be interesting if sampling in Ghana and Togo turn any
positives up during this period, if indeed such important and needed
surveillance is currently being conducted.
