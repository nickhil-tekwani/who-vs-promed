Injecting drugs users are vulnerable to a wide range of infections --
including those caused by viruses such as HIV (human immunodeficiency
virus) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) and bacteria such as _Clostridium
botulinum_ and group A streptococci [and recently anthrax -- see
ProMED-mail archived reports below] -- that can cause significant
morbidity and mortality.

The new report [Health Protection Agency, Health Protection Scotland,
Public Health Wales, CDSC Northern Ireland, and the CRDHB. Shooting
Up: infections among injecting drug users in the United Kingdom 2009.
London: Health Protection Agency, November 2010.] focuses on HIV
among injecting drugs users (IDUs), available at:
<http://www.hpa.org.uk/web/HPAweb&HPAwebStandard/HPAweb_C/1287143581697>.
Its key findings are that:

-- prevalence of HIV among those who have injected drugs remains low
and is estimated to be 1.5 percent overall in the UK. However, it
varies across the country from 0.6 percent in Scotland to 4.1 percent
in London;

-- HIV prevalence among current injectors has increased from 0.7
percent to 1.5 percent over the past decade, and is now similar to
the level found in the early 1990s;

-- uptake of HIV testing is improving, with 3-quarters (75 percent)
of IDUs now reporting that they have had a test; however, about a 3rd
(37 percent) of IDUs with HIV remain unaware of their infection;

-- the vast majority (79 percent) of the HIV-infected IDUs in contact
with specialist HIV-treatment services are receiving anti-retroviral therapy;

-- overall around one-half of IDUs have been infected with hepatitis
C virus, one-6th with hepatitis B virus and about one-3rd reported a
symptom of a bacterial infection (such as a sore or abscess) at an
injecting site in the past year;

-- needle and syringe sharing has declined in recent years, but
almost one-5th (19 percent) of injecting drug users continue to share.

The findings presented in the report indicate a need to continue the
development of services to reduce injecting-related harms and to
support those who want to stop injecting. These services should be
developed in line with published guidelines to ensure that their
provision has sufficient coverage to prevent infections

It is also noted that public health surveillance of the diseases and
behaviours associated with injecting drugs continues to be an
important tool to inform the development of UK policies and services
in this area.

[These findings are rather surprising in that among IDUs HCV at 50
percent is the most prevalent blood-borne virus infection followed by
HBV and bacterial infections, with HIV a long way behind. It is
encouraging that IDUs are now more inclined to seek treatment and
adopt safer practices. - Mod.CP]
