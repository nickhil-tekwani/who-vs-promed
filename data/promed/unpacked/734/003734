[Hedgehogs have been implicated in salmonella transmission

[The following article appeared in the 14 November issue of the Veterinary
Record, 143: 550-552, "Paralysis in hedgehogs (_Erinaceus europeus_)
associated with demyelination", A.C. Palmer et al. The abstract
follows.
Paraplegia affected 14 hedgehogs in a wildlife rescue hospital over a period
of six months. Post-mortem examination revealed demyelination in the brain
and spinal cord and an inflammatory response in the meninges, choroid plexus
and CNS. The peripheral nervous system was not affected. In the spleen,
lungs and liver there was an accumulation of megakaryocytes and other
evidence of extramedullary haemopoiesis, but there was no haematological
evidence of anaemia. The pattern of disease incidence and the nature of the
changes in the CNS suggest they were of viral origin but no causal agent was
isolated [though there was an initial cytopathic effect noted in NBL-7 and
A7 cell line passage and the possibility of a neurotoxin cannot be ruled out.
The script indicates that the hedgehogs were affected between October 1996
and February 1997; they had been hand-reared at the hospital or treaed for
various traumaic injuries. The site is the Wildlife Hospital Trust ("St
Tiggywinkles"), Haddenham, Alysebury. During this period there were some 500
hedgehogs in residence at any one time, with a constant throughput. They
were kept in pens on a concrete floor with hay bedding, and fed proprietary
canned dog food and had access to water at all times. Twelve of the affected
animals were in outside pens and two indoors. They were not from any one
particular part of the hospital. The floors were cleaned & disinfected
regularly with Trigene (MediChem Int.) at various strengths. Injectable
ivermectin was used as a drop-on solution to control ectoparasites.
All the affected animals developed ataxia and paresis slowly, eventually
becoming paraplegic, with urine retention. No other neurological deficit was
noted. The clinical course lasted from one to two weeks.
[Anybody else seen this or similar? Though I imagine there are few
establishments that see this number of hedgehogs routinely - Mod.MHJ
[One more thing for hedgehogs to struggle against in their fight
against extinction in the UK; we recently heard that whirling nylon
thread grass-cutters are shaving their spines & lacerating their
backs as they doze during the day in the shrubbery at the edge of
garden lawns - Mod.JW
