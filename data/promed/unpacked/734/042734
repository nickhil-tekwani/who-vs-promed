Outbreaks of blue tongue threaten the sheep in Annaba
-----------------------------------------------------
The sheep of the wilaya of Annaba, including 54 400 heads, is
threatened by Bluetongue, a deadly viral disease whose vector is the
mosquito [sic; midges]. So far, 11 outbreaks were recorded by the
veterinary services of the wilaya of Annaba, located in the rural
West, Berrahal, Treat, El Oued Aneb, Chorfa and El Eulma. 100 official
and private veterinarians have been mobilized to fight the disease and
prevent its spread by controlling and monitoring livestock markets and
movements of cattle between and within the wilayas. Farms were checked
for their performance of liming, disinfection, disinsectisation and
stable cleaning.

The 1st symptom of this disease is bluish swelling of the tongue [for
more accurate description of clinical bluetongue in sheep, go to
http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Media_Center/docs/pdf/Disease_cards/BLUET-EN.pdf].
Feed consumption is affected; animals can die within a few days; their
meat unfit for human food. This causes irreparable loss to hundreds of
farmers in the region.

The veterinary services of the wilaya which started an awareness
campaign across all farms were editing posters in the national
language, explaining how to fight against this disease and took
samples of affected animals to isolate the virus. It is recalled that
Bluetongue appeared in Annaba for the 1st time in 2000, reappearing in
2006 and 2011.

[In its initial notification, submitted 29 Sep 2011, Algeria reported
4 outbreaks which had started 23 Sep 2011; see 20110930.2956 and map
at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=11081.
During 2010, BTV-1 (46 outbreaks) and BTV-4 (2 outbreaks) were
reported from Algeria. The identity of the BTV serotype involved in
the current, new outbreak is anticipated.

Algeria's neighbour, Morocco, has been experiencing continuing BTV
epizootics caused by the same serotypes since July 2010, new cases
still recently occurring, as can be seen in Morocco's OIE reports and
interactive maps at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=9530
(BTV-1, 27 foci as of 3 Sep 2011), and
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=9531
(BTV-4, 288 foci as of 16 Sep 2011).

The single effective way to control BT in sheep is vaccination. -
