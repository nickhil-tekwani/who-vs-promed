Rust alert for North Coast soybean growers
------------------------------------------
An outbreak of the foliar disease leaf rust is threatening the North
Coast's bumper soybean crop due to be harvested in coming weeks,
according to NSW Department of Primary Industries (DPI). With 13 000
hectares [32 124 acres] of soybeans planted between Macksville and
Tweed Heads and a near record 36 000 tonne crop waiting to finish
off, growers are being advised to monitor their crops for rust and
treat if necessary and possible.

NSW DPI Grafton-based research agronomist Natalie Moore said the
current cool, rainy weather was favourable for rust growth, which was
a concern with harvest so close. "If left unchecked, the rust can
prematurely defoliate the soybean plants and significantly reduce
seed size and tonnage. Growers need to protect the green leaf on the
plant now, especially in the late-planted crops where the pods have
not yet finished filling. The green leaf plays a critical role in
making sure the pods fill to achieve yield potential."

Dr Moore said growers were looking towards a good harvest after last
year's crop was hit hard by flooding rains, especially in the
Richmond Valley and then leaf rust. "Some crops were set back this
season due to the hot dry conditions in January [2009] and late
planting -- so there is a fair bit riding on this harvest." Dr Moore
said growers should assess the stage of their crop -- and determine
whether they have enough green leaf to finish the pods. "If crops
have 5 weeks to run and the current wet conditions continue, growers
need to protect the green leaf with a rust treatment as soon as they
can get back on their paddocks," she said.

[Leaf rust (also called soybean rust, Asian rust) caused by the
fungus _Phakopsora pachyrhizi_ can result in yield losses of soybean
crops of up to 70 percent. It is widespread in Asia and Africa and
spreading in the Americas, but data are lacking on its establishment
in Europe. Besides soybean, over 30 other species in the family of
_Fabaceae_ can also be affected and may serve as pathogen reservoirs.
Spores are spread locally by splashing rain, or by wind over long
distances. Fungicides may be used in disease management, and
partially resistant soybean lines are available. However, new fungal
strains with increased virulence and fungicide resistances are
emerging.

A related, but less virulent species (_P. meibomiae_) is found in
South America and the Caribbean causing similar symptoms.
