WHO BURULI ULCER WORKSHOP
The increasing incidence of Buruli ulcer as an emerging disease in West
Africa prompted WHO to organize a workshop in Accra, Ghana, from the 7-10
June [1999 to facilitate a control strategy for the disease in
the African region.
Buruli ulcer, caused by _Mycobacterium ulcerans_
infection, is endemic in many foci in in sub-Saharan tropical Africa, as
well as in foci in south-east Asia and Australia. The incidence of the
disease has increased markedly in the last decade in several west
African countries, notably Benin, Cote d'Ivoire, and Ghana. In some
countries where once the disease was unknown there are now defined areas
in which there are hundreds of cases annually.
The skin lesions generally respond to early surgical treatment but
there is considerable morbidity associated with neglected lesions when
there is extensive ulceration.
Problems are due to lack of effective surveillance and case
identification, insufficient facilities for confirmation of diagnosis
and treatment, and virtually absent resources for patient rehabilitation
and follow-up.
As well as this requirement for improved facilities for diagnosis
and treatment there is an urgent need for research into this disease.
Research priorities include study of the epidemiology and pathogenesis
of the disease, preventive measures and vaccine development and
definition of optimal treatment programs such as defining the role of
antibiotics given at the time of surgery.
WHO, to address this disease, has adopted Buruli Ulcer as a special
initiative. Further information about this program may be obtained from
Dr. Kingsley Asiedu, WHO Program on Communicable Disease, Geneva,
Switzerland, asieduk@who.ch .
