The Chile Ministry of Health decided to decree a health alert in the
Bio-Bio region when 8 cases of [a] hantavirus [infection] were
confirmed. The cardiopulmonary syndrome is attributed to the explosive
increase of long tailed [pygmy rice] rats [_Oligoryzomys
longicaudatus_], the main transmitters of the disease [virus].

Thus, 3 regions can count on of additional resources to confront the
implications of this public health problem, since the branch of the
Ministry decreed the same measure in Los Lagos and Aysen. The decision
was taken as a preventive measure, "with the objective of avoiding the
spread of the virus in the area," stated the Subsecretary of Public
Health, Jorge Diaz, attending the laboratory of the Institute of
Public Health this Friday [12 Aug 2011].

[The hantavirus responsible for these cases and those reported below
in Chile is not mentioned, but is almost certain to be Andes virus.

In Hualqui [Concepcion province, Bio-Bio region], 2 people died due to
[a] hantavirus [infection], although the origin of the infection is
still unknown. This is a worrying health situation that affects the
neighbors in Hualqui. A 43-year-old man died in the Concepcion
Regional Hospital 23 days ago, where he was brought from Florida due
to evident respiratory complications. His widow is sure that he became
infected during his work repairing a road to the rural locality. Bad
news continued for the woman because on Friday [5 Aug 2011] her
brother-in-law, 33 years old, also died of [a] hantavirus
[infection].

Another 3 workers affected by the virus have been admitted to a
hospital in Penco [Concepcion province, Bio-Bio region].

A hantavirus infection takes a 2nd life in the Los Lagos region.
Although the results of the autopsy are awaited to confirm the cause
of death, the Base Hospital of Puerto Montt confirmed the death of a
resident from the Cochamo community [Llanquihue province, Los Lagos
region] from cardiorespiratory arrest.

Since May [2011], a plague of rodents has affected the inhabitants of
Palena province [Los Lagos region] and the Cochamo community.

The Subsecretary of Public Health, Jorge Diaz, confirmed 39 hantavirus
infection cases nationally, a figure greater than was expected, which
obliged strengthening of preventive work of the Ministry of Health in
the areas of greatest risk in the country, from Maule to Aysen. The
background was given by Diaz during a visit to the biology laboratory
of the Institute of Public Health, during which time he said that last
year [2010], 61 cases of the disease occurred nationally.

According to the current epidemiological situation, the official
stated that, "it is expected that the same number of cases will be
repeated in 2011, classifying the situation as worrying, given the
high fatality rate of the virus [infection]."

In addition to reminding [everyone] of preventive measures (such as
storing food stuffs in closed containers; not leaving leftover food on
the table, furniture and floors; ventilation of closed spaces before
entering), Diaz assured that -- as preventive action -- the SEREMIs
[Secretaria Regional Ministerial de Salud; Regional Ministerial
Secretariat of Health] of the southern regions of the country were
instructed to redouble preventive actions, especially in areas
affected by the earthquake.

Between 20 Jan and 3 Aug [2011], 11 people were confirmed with
hantavirus [infections] and one more is awaiting confirmation; of
these, 6 people died, which signifies a 55 percent fatality rate. Dr
Silvio Ortega, Director of the XVII Sanitary Region, indicated that
the cases were from different localities of Boqueron department, but
most of them were from Chaco Central [region] or nearby. To date,
there are no reports of various cases in just one place.

The physician indicated that the cases are always related to crops of
peanuts and sorghum, "as a relevant fact, the great deforestation that
can be seen in different places, which we think is the cause of
dispersion of mice (_Calomys laucha_)."

Lic. Hugo Paredes stated that as much as possible they will intervene
in places where infection occurred to search for more suspected cases
and to inform the public about preventive measures.

The hantaviruses involved in these cases and those reported below are
not specified. The 21 Jul 2011 ProMED post (archive no. 20110721.2196)
reported that in 2008, in the Boqueron department, there was a
hantavirus epidemic and the year ended with about 30 cases and 4
deaths. At that time, the health authorities attributed the outbreak
in the Chaco region to environmental problems from deforestation of
the region, constant fires, and land clearing that favored the
urbanization of rats, carriers of the virus that causes the disease,
in the communities.

_Calomys laucha_, a rural rodent common in central Chaco areas, is the
one that transmits Laguna Negra hantavirus, according to Paraguay's
Health Surveillance director Dr Ivan Allende. However, in addition to
Laguna Negra virus, other hantaviruses that can cause HPS (hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome) and are found in Paraguay (and their rodent
hosts), from a list kindly provided by Dr James Mills, include Bermejo
(_Oligoryzomys chacoensis_), Lechiguanas (_Oligoryzomys flavescens_),
Central Plata (_Oligoryzomys flavescens_), Anajatuba (possible HPS;
_Oligoryzomys fornesi_), Oran (__Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), and
Juquitiba (__Oligoryzomys nigripes_).

The 1st locally acquired case of [a] hantavirus [infection] in the
Itapua department was detected in a 28-year-old patient resident of
the General Delgado locality, as was confirmed by local health
authorities. The patient is currently in stable condition, admitted to
the Encarnacion Regional Hospital, after intensive treatment in the
Instituto de Prevision Social [Institute of Social Welfare]. This case
has no relation to the Chaco [region -- see [5] above], where an
outbreak of the disease was registered.

"Yesterday [6 Aug 2011] a team from the regional unit went there with
epidemiologists, physicians, and officials from SENAPA [Servicio
Nacional de Erradicacion del Paludismo; National Service for the
Eradication of Malaria], although in reality SENAPA is not in charge
of rodent issues. They went there to do collect data on where the
patient was working, to look for other people who might be suspected
of having the disease, and to look for any connection as to how this
happened," stated Dr Jose Antonio Rolon, Director of the 7th Health
Region.

The official confirmed that the patient is the 1st locally acquired
hantavirus [infection] case in Itapua department, where 3 cases were
detected in 2005 and 2006, [but] all were imported from other areas of
the country.
