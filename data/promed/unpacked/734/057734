Plague in western China kills one person
------------------------------
One person in China has died of the plague and another has been infected,
the health ministry and state media said Wednesday.
The cases were found in the western regions of Gansu and Qinghai, the
ministry said on its Web site. It did not provide any other details or say
in which area the death occurred. Telephones were not answered at health
bureaus in either region.
The Beijing News said local health officials and governments have "taken
measures to put things under control," but did not elaborate.
One case occurred in Sunan Yugu in Gansu, the newspaper said, while the
other was found in Qinghai's Qilian county.
Neither the health ministry nor the newspaper identified the type of
plague. The term "plague" applies to a number of contagious, likely fatal
bacterial diseases transmitted by fleas from infected rats and by contact
with infected blood or tissue. The most common form, the bubonic plague,
results in high fever, delirium and swollen lymph nodes.
Outbreaks have killed about 200 million people in the past 1500 years. The
most infamous epidemic, Europe's Black Death, started in 1347, killing 25
million people in Europe and 13 million in the Middle East and China within
5 years.
An outbreak in China's southwest in 1997 infected 19 people. The victims
were hospitalised, and disease prevention teams and villagers were
mobilized to kill mice and fleas, according to the official Xinhua News
Agency. Local officials denied there were any cases.
