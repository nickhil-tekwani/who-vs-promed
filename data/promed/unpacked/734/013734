The number of cases tied to Washoe County's viral meningitis outbreak rose to 54 as of last week, according to health officials.

The county's Health District announced via Facebook the new figure, saying 72 percent of the cases, or about 39, are children age 17 and under. The news brings the number of cases up from the previous report of 46 cases from earlier in November 2017.

Health officials say parents should go over prevention efforts with their kids, including encouraging washing hands, covering coughs and sneezes and disinfecting surfaces like doorknobs, handrails and desks.

[Meningitis refers to the inflammation of the meninges, the tissues that surround the brain and spinal cord, and implies lack of specific brain and spinal cord involvement (called encephalitis and myelitis, respectively, although some involvement may be present). In viral meningitis, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is usually visibly clear, but on laboratory examination, the CSF white cell count is 6 to 500 cells per cmm, usually with lymphocytes predominating. Usually, the CSF glucose level is normal (as compared to bacterial meningitis, where it is low), and the CSF protein level is mildly elevated (where in bacterial meningitis it is significantly elevated). As noted, the symptoms of viral meningitis usually last from 7 to 10 days, and the patient recovers completely.

The non-polio enteroviruses are the most common causes of viral meningitis, especially during the summer and fall months. Most people who get infected with enteroviruses are asymptomatic or have only a non-specific febrile illness. Enteroviruses are most often spread via the fecal-oral route from person to person, through fecal contamination of water or food, or contact with contaminated inanimate objects.

The ECHO viruses (enteric cytopathic human orphan) viruses are part of the enterovirus species in the picornavirus family. Type 30 has certainly been reported to cause outbreaks of viral meningitis. An example is Faustino A, Fano V, Muscillo M, et al: An outbreak of aseptic meningitis due to echovirus 30 associated with attending school and swimming in pools. Int J Infect Dis. 2006;10: 291-7; available at:
http://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(05)00203-1/pdf.

No available specific therapy for ECHO viruses has existed; however, pleconaril, a 1st-of-its-kind viral capsid-inhibitor compound -- an experimental agent with in vitro activity against most enteroviruses -- appears to have efficacy with a good safety profile. It does not appear that it has received FDA approval in the USA. - Mod.LL
