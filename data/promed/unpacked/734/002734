The following information was received from Prof S K Lam in connection
with
the recent chikungunya (CHIK) outbreak in Port Klang:
>Chikungunya virus is a member of the alphavirus group and related to
Ross
River virus, Barmah Forest virus and Sindbis virus. Malaysia had never
experienced such an outbreak, although a paper by Marchette et al. in
1980
indicated serological evidence of CHIK in the country (Southeast Asian J
Trop Med Pub Hlth 11: 14-23, 1980).
The clinical picture of this outbreak was classical of CHIK infection,
with
abrupt onset of fever, maculopapular rash and rheumatic manifestations.
The
outbreak started in early December 1998 and to date, 27 cases have been
identified, with 10 hospital admissions. 80% of the patients were adult
females, predominantly among Indians which made up the bulk of the
population in this area. Several patients experienced severe
arthralgias
which were polyarticular, migratory and predominantly affecting the
small
joints of the hands, wrists, ankles and feet.
The outbreak started after flooding in the locality and the _Aedes
aegypti_
index then was 3.2. [House index -- no. of _A.aegypti_/house? - Mod.JW]
Working in close collaboration with Dr David W Smith, Clinical Director,
Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, The Western Australian
Centre for Pathology and Medical Research, Perth, Australia, rubella,
dengue,
and other alphaviruses were ruled out. CHIK IgM was detected in 6 out of
6
samples tested and HI showed cross-reaction with Sindbis and Ross River
[viruses].
In anticipation of the further spread of the outbreak, the WHO
Collaborating
Centre for Arbovirus Reference and Research (DF/DHF) in Kuala Lumpur,
with
the help of Australia, will have the test available locally soon.
Countries
in the region where dengue is endemic should take note of the
possibility of
CHIK infection.

[Note that the mosquito vector of CHIK is identical to that of dengue, &
the symptoms are identical to those of dengue with the exception that
dengue predominantly affects the large joints -- elbows & knees. Mixed
outbreaks of both CHIK & dengue have been recorded, I think in the
Philippines - Mod.JW]
