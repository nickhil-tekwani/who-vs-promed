A new norovirus strain emerged during the winter of 2009-10, causing
16 percent of all norovirus outbreaks, CDC [Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention] scientists reported today [13 Jul 2011].

Outbreaks involving the virus, the most common cause of foodborne
illness, are typically caused by GII.4 genotype strains. However, that
winter, a new GII.12 strain emerged, causing several outbreaks.

The researchers' phylogenetic analysis of the strain found that it
was distinct from GII.12 strains that emerged before 2009 and was most
similar to ones previously identified from Australia and Hungary. The
increase in novel GII.12 outbreaks was detected using 2 different
surveillance networks, and the recombinant strain didn't show evidence
of enhanced efficiency to replicate. The investigators suggested that
unique amino acid substitutions that suggest emergence could have been
caused by virulence features that were coded outside the highly
variable P2 region or changes in population susceptibility. They added
that the high percentage of outbreaks caused by a rare genotype
supports the importance of norovirus strain typing.

[ProMED-mail does not routinely report outbreaks of norovirus
infection because of their ubiquity and short duration. However, the
appearance and dispersion of a new strain can be a relevant factor in
the epidemic process that should be recorded. - Mod.CP]
