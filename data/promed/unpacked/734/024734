Yellow Fever
Bolivia. As of January 1999 a total of 27 confirmed cases with 13
deaths have been reported to the Pan American Health Organization
(PAHO/WHO). All cases occurred in rural settings of the department of
Santa Cruz, located within 120 - 200 km south of the city of Santa
Cruz de la Sierra. Twenty-two cases (82%) were male and 5 (18%)
female. The age distribution of the cases was 82% over 15 years of
age, 11% 10 to 15 years, and 7% 5 to 10 years. Fifteen cases
were not vaccinated for yellow fever, two have presumptively received
the vaccine, and the status of 10 was unknown. Mass immunization was
started immediately after the confirmation of the first reported
cases. No suspected cases have been reported in the last two weeks
despite increased surveillance.
In the last 10 years, Bolivia has reported 461 cases of yellow fever.
Sixty three cases were reported in 1997 and fifty seven in 1998.
During 1997, the primarily affected Departments were Cochabamba (74%)
and Beni (15%). In 1998, the areas involved were lowlands of the
Department of La Paz (44%) and west counties of the Department of
Santa Cruz (30%). In 1999 all cases have been reported from the
southeast counties of Santa Cruz. The trend suggests a southeastward
spread of the disease through the country. The current lower
reporting of cases outside of the department of Santa Cruz may be
attributed to vaccinations implemented during the 1997 and 1998
outbreaks. The presence of the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito in Santa Cruz
has continuously presented a serious risk to the urbanization of
yellow fever.
Bolivia has recently developed with the assistance of PAHO a 5 year
project to strengthen its immunization program. This initiative will
be in part financed by the World Bank and includes plans to increase
the vaccination coverage of all age groups in the enzootic areas and
to introduce the yellow fever vaccine in the routine national
immunization program.
