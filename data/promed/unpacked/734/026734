CLIMATE CHANGE AND EMERGING INFECTIONS (11): RECENT ARTICLES
============================================================
Here are some references from last year that may be of interest.
Cheers,
Erwin.
===================
[] "Infectious Diseases and Global Warming: Tracking Disease Incidence
Rates Globally," N.C. Low (Low & Associates Actuary, 20125 Bader Circle,
Cerritos CA 90703), World Resour. Rev., 7(3), 386-402, Sep. 1995.
There is no global database system to monitor infections to which
global data of climate change and other environmental factors can be
calibrated, investigated and correlated. Discusses the importance of
choosing the correct measure of disease morbidity. Proposes establishing
such a database and discusses the infrastructure and data sources for
building it.
[] "Global Atmospheric Change and Human Health: More than Merely Adding
up the Risks," W.J.M. Martens (Dept. Math., Univ. Limburg, POB 616, 6200
MD Maastricht Neth.), J. Rotmans , O.J. Vrieze, World Resour. Rev., 7(3),
404-416.
Large-scale environmental disturbances may become important factors in
human health. Changes in climate, stratospheric ozone and air pollution are
interrelated, may be synergistic, and may be superimposed on changes in
socioeconomic development and population growth. Describes an integrated
modeling framework to assess changes in public health under various
environmental conditions, yield insights into the complex interrelations,
and develop strategies for sustainable development.
[] "Climate Change and Vector-Borne Diseases: A Global Modelling
Perspective," W.J.M. Martens (Dept. Math., Univ. Limburg, POB 616, 6200 MD
Maastricht Neth.), T.H. Jetten et al., Global Environ. Change, 5(3),
195-209, June 1995.
Uses general circulation model scenarios of climate change to assess
potential changes in areas vulnerable to malaria and schistosomiasis. The
transmission potential of both diseases is very sensitive to climate changes
on the periphery of the present endemic areas and at higher altitudes within
the areas. The health impact will be most pronounced in populations living
the less economically developed temperate areas in which endemicity is low
or absent.
