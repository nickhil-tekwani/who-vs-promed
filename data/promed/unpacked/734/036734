A total of 20 people have been reportedly killed by a cholera outbreak in Adamawa State, while 16 others are battling for their lives presently from the epidemic. SaharaReporters learned that the deadly disease, currently ravaging Gbalang town, in the Numan Local Government Area, has brought panic to the residents. Residents of the community called on Governor Ahmadu Fintiri, to urgently address the raging epidemic.

A youths leader in the Gbalang community, Umar Sadau, told SaharaReporters on [Thu 7 Oct 2021] that 20 people, including women and children, had died after contracting the disease. Saidu further disclosed that 16 others were receiving medical treatment at the Numan General Hospital and Gbalang Dispensary.

He said, "The disease (cholera) which is currently ravaging the community has taken its toll. When a victim comes down with cholera, they die within hours, and sometimes the following day. So far, we've buried 20 corpses, all victims of the disease, and 16 others are in the hospital right now."

Confirming the incident, the Director, Public Health in the state Ministry of Health, Dr. Laori Celine, said cholera was reported from the Numan area. She said, "Our records have shown 15 cases of the cholera outbreak and one dead in Numan LGA. And interventions such as the provision of Aqua tabs, awareness on hygiene are being given. We also engaged some NGOs to support us in reaching out to the affected communities."

[2] Cholera - Congo DR
Date: Tue 5 Oct 2021
Source: Outbreak News Today [edited]
http://outbreaknewstoday.com/cholera-democratic-republic-of-the-congo-reports-increase-in-number-of-new-cases-39254/


According to the WHO, The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has been experiencing a cholera outbreak since the beginning of 2021. From [January to 12 Sep 2021], a total of 4671 suspected cases of cholera, including 91 deaths (Case Fatality Ratio (CFR) = 2%), were reported from 73 health districts in 14 regions. The weekly average number of suspected cases is around 130.

In the week ending [12 Sep 2021], there was an increase in number of new cases reported with 186 cases and one death (CFR 0.1%) and this increase has been seen for four consecutive weeks. More than 96% of new cases were reported from 2 regions (Tanganyika and South Kivu) which declared new outbreaks a month before.

WHO says DRC faces cholera outbreaks every year since 1974 when _Vibrio cholerae_ was detected for the first time in the country. Overtime, the recorded case fatality ratio has always been above 1%, the acceptable threshold established by WHO. For 2021, the cholera outbreak shows a much lower intensity compared to the same period in the previous 4 years. This could be because of the positive impact of response interventions put in place in recent years, in particular the strengthening of water-sanitation and hygiene, the capacity building of health facilities in the detection and management of cholera cases and cholera vaccination in some at risk areas.

[3] Cholera - Mozambique (Cabo Delgado)
Date: Mon 11 Oct 2021
Source: Africa News [edited]
https://www.africanews.com/2021/10/11/mozambique-icrc-director-of-operations-says-combined-impact-of-conflict-and-extreme-weather-in-cabo-delgado-threaten-public-health/


Massive displacement in Cabo Delgado, Mozambique's northern province, has put an enormous strain on existing water and health facilities, some of which were previously damaged by extreme weather events. As a result, a concerning shortage of safe water, sanitation and health services is a looming threat to public health for displaced people and host communities.

"A lot of people depend on this type of water and this is definitely not to any standards of public health," said Dominik Stillhart, director of operations for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), who is completing a 3-day visit to Cabo Delgado. "I think it is very important to pay very serious attention to what is happening here, especially in the North of Mozambique."

Mozambique has increasingly been facing the compounded impact of armed conflict and climate change in recent years, which takes a toll on people's health. Recurring and more frequent cyclones and floods have damaged health and water facilities, such as the hospital on Ibo, which was the only health facility serving the archipelago. More than 800 000 people, one-third of the province's entire population, have fled their homes due to the escalation of the armed conflict, finding shelter in urban areas and on the islands. Displaced people frequently settle down in city outskirts, outside the coverage of the water distribution systems.

Rapid population movement and limited access to safe water sources in precarious settlements led to the rise of waterborne diseases like cholera and diarrhea. The ICRC has observed a correlation between the concentration of groups of displaced people, the absence of protected water sources and the spread of waterborne diseases. According to WHO, the number of cholera cases in Cabo Delgado at the beginning of [August 2021] was 3400, compared to approximately 2200 from the same period in 2020. In the first semester of 2021, 28 602 cases of diarrhea have been registered in the province, of which 40% of cases were registered in districts where ICRC has focused its work, such as Montepuez and Ibo islands. Diarrhea has become the 2nd cause of death among children under 5. COVID represents an additional risk, partially associated with the lack of hygiene.

A lack of functioning health facilities reduced the capacity of the health system to detect and respond to disease outbreaks. As many as 80% of health centres in the 9 most conflict-affected northern districts of Cabo Delgado are not functioning. The already fragile health infrastructure has been further weakened as a result of the armed conflict, even as the demand for health services increased by 20% to 30% in southern areas of Cabo Delgado province that have been receiving displaced people. The overstretched health facilities have been struggling with the shortage of space, overcrowding, and lack of staff and medical supplies.

The ICRC is working with local authorities to rehabilitate the existing water and health infrastructures, as well as build new ones, to improve access to health and clean water and prevent the spread of deadly diseases, both on the mainland -- for instance in the city of Montepuez -- as well as on the islands. The ICRC is constructing a new hospital on Ibo which will serve the entire 30-island archipelago. Because the coastal areas of Mozambique are vulnerable to climate shocks, all of ICRC's new rehabilitation and construction projects are systematically conceived and built with resilient infrastructure to prevent as much as possible potential damage by natural catastrophes.

On [2 Oct 2021] 16 suspected cholera cases were registered in Diffa region, in the southeast of the country, where no cases had been reported yet since the epidemic was declared on [9 Aug 2021]. With the start of the school year, the Komadougou river rising waters, and the ongoing population displacements, humanitarian actors in Diffa fear large-scale contamination. Humanitarian organizations are mobilizing to provide medical care, disinfection of water points, and awareness-raising activities. As of [27 Sep 2021], 5070 people across 6 of the country's 8 regions have fallen ill and 154 have died, with a 3% fatality rate, higher than the benchmark 1% rate.

[5] Diarrhea, fatal: Nepal (Kapilvastu)
Date: Fri 8 Oct 2021
Source: Kathmandu Post [edited]
https://kathmandupost.com/health/2021/10/08/samples-from-kapilvastu-villages-brought-to-kathmandu-for-tests


Samples of drinking water and stools of the infected people from wards 7, 8 and 9 of Krishnanagar Municipality in Kapilvastu district that have been hit by a diarrhea-like outbreak were sent to Kathmandu for tests on [Thu 7 Oct 2021], after the Lumbini Provincial Hospital could not diagnose the disease. The samples will be tested in the National Public Health Laboratory, officials said. "We have sent the samples to Kathmandu by air," Dr. Bikash Devkota, secretary for the provincial Ministry of Health and Population, told the Post over the phone from Butwal. "Although the symptoms in patients are similar to cholera, the laboratory of the provincial hospital could not confirm the disease, so the samples are being tested at the Kathmandu lab."

Since the outbreak started on [Mon 4 Oct 2021] night, at least 2 people including a 7-year-old have died and 370 others were infected as of [Thu 7 Oct 2021] morning, in the municipality. Officials at the municipality said that 32 patients, whose health conditions are serious, have been referred to Butwal and other cities for further treatment. "The number of diarrheal patients has been increasing every hour," Shankar Bhattarai, health coordinator of the municipality, told the Post, over the phone from Kapilvastu. "The situation has not yet come under control in the disease-hit villages."

Schools in the areas have been shut as a lot of children have been infected, according to secretary Devkota. Cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhea and vomiting, which causes dehydration and can lead to death within a few hours if left untreated.

Both the victims died at their homes before reaching the health facilities, according to Bhattarai. As the number of patients has been rising and the 15-bed local hospital overwhelmed, doctors are treating the patients on hospital grounds, under tents and at 2 schools, according to Raj Kishor Yadav, chairman of ward 7. "We have launched a door-to-door campaign to make people aware of diarrheal diseases and urged them to boil water before drinking and maintain proper sanitation and hygiene," said Yadav.

Cholera remains a problem in poor countries, which lack safe drinking water and proper sanitation infrastructures. Nepal is also a cholera endemic country as cases of infection of the deadly disease are detected every year. The disease also continues to be reported in Kathmandu Valley. Doctors say poor sanitation and contaminated drinking water are the main factors for a cholera outbreak. Authorities in the municipality suspected that contaminated water was responsible for the outbreak. "In more than 3 places, drinking water mains have been damaged by the heavy machinery used in the construction of Postal Highway," said Yadav. "People in the villages also drink water from tube wells, which could be contaminated."

Navsari District Collector Amit Prakash Yadav declared on [Wed 6 Oct 2021], Ambada cholera-affected after the village reported 63 cases of diarrhea the prior 2 days. According to local administration, the cause of disease is suspected to be leakage in the drinking water pipeline network. Of the 63 patients with diarrhea, 34 are admitted in primary health care centre at Ambada and Khudsad villages, while the remaining are undergoing treatment at home. Those infected also include 19 children.

After the incident came to light [Tue 5 Oct 2021] evening, the district health department officials reached Talav street in Ambada to examine the situation. The villagers were provided drinking water through tankers by the administrative teams. Residents of neighboring villages like Vasar, Singoda, Ughat and Todi have also reported symptoms of diarrhea.

The district panchayat officials have identified leakage in the water pipeline and got it repaired. Cleaning activities in Ambada and its neighboring villages were carried out by the health department, while roadside lorries and eatery stalls were closed. Collector Yadav reached Ambada village and spoke to local residents, and after consulting with the health department, declared the village cholera-infected. The health department has also started door-to-door survey at the village from [Wed 6 Oct 2021].

Chief District Health Officer Dr. Dilip Bhavsar told The Indian Express, "We have found that there was leakage in the drinking water pipeline network, and it was immediately repaired. Villagers are provided water through an underground pipeline network, from the overhead water tank at the village. The water tank has been cleaned today. We have deployed health department teams in Ambada village who are taking note of the situation."

A total of 63 patients had diarrhea and through laboratory testing a case of cholera was found in one of the reports, he added. "Residents from neighboring villages have also complained of vomiting and other symptoms of diarrhea. Our teams are deployed there as well and they are carrying out door-to-door survey," he said.

[As stated by Lutwick et al. (Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Edited by Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J. New York: Nova Bioscience; 2017, pp 113-127), oral rehydration therapy can be lifesaving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Guerrant et al. (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it first recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al. (1) highlight the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30% to 3.6% (4) and quote sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally, glucose- or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 mL/kg followed by 100 mL/kg in the first 4 hours and 100 mL/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the first 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
