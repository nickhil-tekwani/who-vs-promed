After infection with a potentially lethal bacterium claimed the life
of his father, the son is warning people against swimming in
Louisiana bayous [small, slow-moving streams or creeks].
During June 2007, a man was on the Robinson Canal in Cocodrie, LA,
when he fell overboard and cut his hand on a piece of tin. From then
on, he battled an infection with _Vibrio vulnificus_, a disease found
during the summer months in warm salt water. "He stayed in the
hospital on life support for 26 days, from the time of the accident
until he passed away on 12 Jun 2007," his son said.
_Vibrio vulnificus_ can be treated with antibiotics, but it has to be
treated early. Or, as the son warned, don't go into the water at all.
"As we have seen in the last month, it can be very devastating," he said.
The CDC (US Centers for Disease Control & Prevention) said
bloodstream infections are fatal in about 50 percent of cases.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett
[ProMED-mail has recently posted another case of life-threatening _V.
vulnificus_ originating in the waters off of Texas. This case
occurred in Louisiana, the state immediately east of Texas. Both
cases involved cutaneous exposure although the same illness can be
acquired after ingesting raw oysters or clams containing the organism.
A reasonable discussion of the disease in humans can be found in that
posting (20070719.2317). There are 2 points to be emphasized: that
vibrios are normal flora in warm salt water (not indicative of any
sewage contamination) and that most of the life-threatening illnesses
occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including
imunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes.
So-called normal individuals often just get gastroenteritis.
The range of disease due to _V. vulnificus_ can involve more northern
geographical areas if the area is affected by a substantial heat wave. - Mod.LL
