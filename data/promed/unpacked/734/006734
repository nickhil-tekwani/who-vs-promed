A boy has succumbed to rabies at the Phuentsholing hospital today [23
Apr 2011]. His age could not be confirmed. Dr. D K Mohanti said he
could be between 8 and 10. His family also could not be traced, and
his nationality is not established.

The hospital's ambulance picked him up from the town this morning [23
Apr 2011]. Dr. Mohanti said that by the time he was brought to the
hospital, he had already developed hydrophobia, or fear of water,
which is a symptom of rabies. The boy had told the doctor that he was
bitten by a dog about a week ago. This is the 1st death from rabies to
be recorded in Phuentsholing hospital this year [2011].

A 36-year-old woman died of rabies at the Gelephu Central Referral
Hospital on Sunday [24 Apr 2011]. The woman was bitten by her
neighbor's pet dog in February this year [2011]. This is the 1st case
of death caused by rabies in Gelephu this year. In 2009, 2 students
died of rabies.

Health officials in Gelephu confirmed that the woman had already
developed hydrophobia, or fear of water, when she was brought to the
hospital. Hydrophobia is a symptom of rabies. Medical records showed
that the deceased received only a tetanus toxoid injection from the
hospital. She did not get anti-rabies vaccination. Health officials
had advised her to come for anti-rabies vaccination if the dog that
bit her died within 10 days. Since the dog did not die, the deceased
did not go to the hospital. Health officials said anyone bitten by
stray dogs or who has come in contact with rabid animals should come
to the hospital for immediate treatment.

Veterinarians said since Gelephu has a porous border [with India to
the south] and is an endemic zone for rabies, people should be extra
cautious while dealing with animals. So far this year [2011], the
Gelephu Satellite Veterinary laboratory detected 9 rabies cases.

[Bhutan and the towns of Phuentsholing and Gelephu can be located on
the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at
http://healthmap.org/r/00CK. Both towns are located close to the
border with West Bengal (India).

Although rabies is endemic in Bhutan, cases of human rabies have been
infrequent (these are the only 2 fatalities this year [2011]).
Anti-rabies post-exposure prophylaxis appears to have been available
in each of the hospitals receiving these patients but was not
administered because, tragically, symptoms of rabies were already far
advanced in both cases. In one case, the victim had been wrongly
advised that there was no risk of infection if the dog involved
survived for more than 10 days after the incident. The details of the
other case are unknown. - Mod.CP]
