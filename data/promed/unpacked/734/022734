[This is the 3rd focus of LSD in Israel since 20 Jun 2006. The
primary outbreak, initially involving 30 cases in a dairy operation
comprising 609 bovines, was notified to the OIE on 26 Jun 2006. The
30 clinically affected head were reportedly destroyed, and a ring
vaccination was applied within 3-km radius around the infected farm,
including 4000 head in 5 localities. The vaccine used was a live
attenuated sheep pox vaccine
RM65; see <http://oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_12.HTM#Sec4>.
Two weeks later, on 11 Jul 2006, the authorities sent follow-up
report No 1 with updated data, notifying that 190 LSD cases were
detected among the 605-strong unit. The 190 clinical cases were
destroyed, and the vaccination extended to a 10-km radius around the
quarantined focus. See
<http://oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_10.HTM#Sec9>.
On 25 Jul 2006 (follow-up report No 2), a single case in a dairy cow
out of 130 (vaccinated) bovines, in a stable located in moshav Shafir
(1 km from the primary outbreak) was notified; the cow was destroyed.
See <http://oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_08.HTM#Sec11>.
The current case, in Kfar Varburg, at a distance of 3 km from the
primary outbreak, is thus the 3rd focus. The early detection of
sporadic/single cases, followed by their immediate destruction,
reflects the intensity of the clinical surveillance carried out in
farms around the outbreak.
An OIE map of the primary outbreak is available at
<http://www.oie.int/cartes/1930_ISR.png>.
For an interactive map, showing En Zurim as well as Shafir and Kfar
Varburg, see
<http://nona.net/features/map/placedetail.1524428/%E2%80%98En%20%E1%BA%94urim/>.
The observations on this exceptional outbreak of LSD ex-Africa, in
high-producing dairy cattle, might be a source of invaluable
information. It will be interesting to ascertain the accumulated
number of (post-vaccination) cases in the primary focus, and details
of the vaccination policy applied in southern Israel (are
revaccinations contemplated? if affirmative, how frequently?).
