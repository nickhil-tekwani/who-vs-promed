A 6-year-old boy passed away on Sunday [14 Apr 2013] due to hemorrhagic fever. In March [2013], 2 other fatal cases were reported, and there are 115 suspected cases in the whole Department [this year, 2013?]. The last case was reported in the town of Magdalena in a boy that, according to the family, has not been in the countryside.

The head of the Departmental Health Service, Dr. Camargo, suspects that the boy was in the country side even if the family denies it, since so far no hemorrhagic fever cases were reported in urban areas. At the beginning, dengue hemorrhagic fever [DHF] was suspected, so DHF was tested for due to the recent positive [confirmed] cases observed in the area [Apparently, the tests for DHF were negative. Mod.TY].

In March 2013, 3 persons were infected by the [Machupo] virus in an abandoned ranch in Nirumo (Guayanamerin), where the group stayed overnight. They slept on the floor and drank water. Two of them died. A further epidemiological investigation found 3 [Machupo virus] infected dead rodents in the area.

Dr. Camargo stated that hemorrhagic fever occurs due to the insufficient preventive measures implemented in Magdalena. This may be a consequence of hiring un-prepared staff to pursue preventive measures. Nevertheless, the individual in charge of the Hemorrhagic Fever Program stated that those problems can be solved.

[The occurrence of cases of Bolivian hemorrhagic fever continues in this area of Beni department. Last month (March 2013), the mayor of Magdalena municipality, Jaime Alverez, expressed his concern about the outbreak of hemorrhagic fever cases in this populace and requested that health authorities take the necessary steps to prevent this disease.

Last year (2012), ProMED-mail reported that 13 people had been infected with Machupo virus, which causes Bolivian hemorrhagic fever, and 7 had died as a consequence of the disease. In Beni department at that time, 5 municipalities, including Magdalena, were reported to have had large populations of _Calomys callosus_ mice, the reservoir host of Machupo virus, an arenavirus that can cause persistent infections in the mice. Apparently, this situation still exists. Rodent control in an around houses is the only effective way to prevent exposure to the virus. No vaccine is commercially available. Although health officials can provide information about rodent control and assist in implementing it, effective long-term implementation ultimately rests with local residents.
