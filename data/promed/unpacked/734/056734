Switzerland confirmed on Sunday [26 Feb 2006] its first outbreak of avian
flu in a wild duck on the shores of Geneva, near the city's famous jet
d'eau fountain.
Swiss officials said it was not yet clear if the bird, found on Wednesday
floating between 2 boats next to the jet d'eau pier, was infected with the
deadly H5N1 strain of the virus. "We have a 1st case of bird flu. It's H5,"
Federal Veterinary Office spokeswoman Cathy Maret said, adding that a
sample has been sent to a European reference laboratory in Britain to test
for the H5N1 strain in the duck.
Results are expected at the weekend, she said. [The website of VLA,

Switzerland has been on high alert for bird flu since the virus emerged in
neighbours France, Germany, Austria, and Italy. The country this month
ordered all poultry be kept indoors for an indefinite period to lessen the
risk from the fast-spreading H5N1 virus that has killed millions of birds.
The Swiss Federal Veterinary Office said that in addition to the Geneva
case, 2 wild ducks have tested positive for bird flu in the German towns of
Ohningen and Singen, over the border from Lake Constance in eastern
Switzerland. "Switzerland is equally concerned about these areas," the
government agency said.
The Swiss cantons Schaffhausen and Thurgau, located near the affected
German sites, on Sunday enacted controls to restrict the movement of
poultry and other birds and boost testing.
Officials in Geneva also enacted a surveillance zone around the site of its
bird flu finding, although there are few poultry farms in the immediate
area, which is principally urban.
Nearly 200 000 people live in Geneva, home to the United Nations European
headquarters, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and a
smattering of private banks. [And, ironically, the Mecca of public health
-- home to the headquarters of the World Health Organization. - Mod.AS]
In the city's Eaux Vives neighbourhood, red and white police tape blocked
public access to the jetty where the infected duck, a female thought to be
local to the area, was found [see comment below].
Dozens of people casually walked and jogged along a lakeside path next to
the blocked-off pier on Sunday evening. Young children kicked a ball within
steps of ducks and small birds on the water's edge. Local health
authorities stressed there was little human risk from the single outbreak
in Geneva despite its urban site.
Philippe Sudre, state medical officer for the Geneva canton, said that
although the infected bird was found in a densely populated area, it was
"extremely improbable" that the virus would spread to humans living near
the lake. "The risk from water is very, very close to zero," Sudre said.
In addition to the infected duck, Geneva sent samples from 16 other suspect
birds for laboratory testing and all were found negative for avian flu,
Laurence Mermod of the Geneva veterinary office told reporters.

[According to the Swiss press, the infected bird was a "gansesager", namely
the common merganser (goosander in Europe), _Mergus merganser_, a large sea
duck.(Picture at

Confirmation of the suspected H5N1 case, and further ornithological data,
including the geographical distribution and -- if not sedentary --
migratory patterns of this species, would be helpful. - Mod.AS]
