'Mystery' Epidemic was Relapsing Fever
--------------------------------------------------
Investigations by an international team during March and April 1999 have
identified the epidemic that has ravaged Rumbek County since last year
as louse-borne relapsing fever.
Consequently, a plan of outbreak control has been constituted in
consideration of the local circumstances. The action plan is "based on
local surveillance, tiered responses by primary health care personnel and
community health workers supported by NGOs," according to a preliminary
report of the investigation team.
The team comprised Rumishael Shoo, M. Ryan and P. Tharmahornpilas
from the World Health Organisation WHO, D. Dennis, K. Orlsoki and
D. O'Leary of the US Centres for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC)
and M. Kiruga from Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS).
The fatal malaria-like epidemic is characterised by high fever, headache,
chills, severe joint pains and prostration, often complicated by jaundice
and bleeding. The report defines relapsing fever as a severe febrile
disease usually lasting 2-3 weeks. It is caused by _Borrelia recurrentis_,
a bacterium, and is transmitted by body lice.
Relapsing fever's incubation period is about a week and about 20 percent of
untreated cases die. An effective treatment recommended by the report is a
single dose of simple antibiotics (erythromycin, tetracycline or doxycycline).
Preventive measures include improvement of personal hygiene and
elimination of transmission agents by the use of insecticides.
An earlier investigation conducted in January by six NGOs had confirmed an
outbreak of a mysterious epidemic throughout the Sudanese County and
suspected a viral cause. However, laboratory results proved negative for
viral fevers.
As the epidemic continued to wreak havoc, WHO and OLS stepped in,
sending a team to carry out a preliminary investigation and to collect further
laboratory specimens. Extensive testing of the samples was carried out at
the Kenya Medical Research Institute and at the National Institute of
Virology in South Africa. A number of the samples were positive for
_Borrelia_ sp. [species, which causes the relapsing fever.
A combined WHO, CDC and OLS team was formed last month to carry
out an epidemiological investigation to confirm the cause of the outbreak,
identify effective surveillance and control measures and assist the NGOs to
put them in place.
Though accurate statistics on the number of lives claimed by the epidemic
are not readily available, it is believed to have caused hundreds of
deaths. The final report on the deadly epidemic will be available in two to
three weeks.
The Catholic Bishop of the Diocese of Rumbek, Monsignor Caesar Mazzolari,
said here early this year that in the month of January 1999 alone, the
epidemic claimed 580 lives.
