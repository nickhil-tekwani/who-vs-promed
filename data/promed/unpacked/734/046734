Cattle Brucellosis Eradication in Texas: Close, But, Not Yet [edited]
--------------------------------------------------
Animal health officials were disappointed, but not surprised in September
2003, when they detected a cattle herd infected with brucellosis in
Henderson County, breaking a 13-month stretch during which no newly
infected herds were detected in Texas. Texas and Missouri are the only
states in the nation not free from this bacterial disease.
"We are closing in on the last infected herds in Texas, and after months of
not finding infection, we were hopeful we might have finally eradicated the
disease," commented Dr. Max Coats, deputy director for Animal Health
Programs at the Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC). "With more than 153
000 cattle herds in Texas, finding the last infected herds is like looking
for the proverbial 'needle in the haystack.' We still may find a few more
infected herds in Texas before we join the ranks of the other
brucellosis-free states in this national disease eradication program."
"Twice now, we've gone longer than a year without finding a
brucellosis-infected herd in Texas," said Dr. Coats. "The first time was
from July 2000 through December 2001, but soon after, we detected and
depopulated 4 infected herds in Montgomery, Rusk, Henderson, and Colorado
Counties. Then, after a lull of more than a year, we detected the latest
infected herd, in Henderson County, through our routine testing of adult
breeding cattle being sold at livestock markets. We're in the process of
testing neighboring herds and tracing cattle movement into and out of the
Henderson County herd to determine if infection has spread."

[With such a large number of herds in the state, such disappointments are
-- unfortunately -- to be expected. In Louisiana we had a similar
disappointment, having been free for a couple of years, when a rancher who
kept very much to himself and had a small herd suddenly needed some cash
and sold a few of his cows; one turned out to be a reactor at the auction
barn. So far we have had no more surprises from "hermit" herds. The new
RB15 vaccine has made a very significant impact on the success of the US
eradication scheme. - Mod.MHJ]
