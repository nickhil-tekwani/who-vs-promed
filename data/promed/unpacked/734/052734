Irish parents be warned: hand-foot-mouth disease [HFMD] cases are on the rise. With children back at school, there is a rapid increase in cases, and parents are being urged to look out for the signs.

HFMD is a common, mild illness caused by a type of virus called an enterovirus. It gets its name from the non-itchy rash that develops on the palms of your hands and soles of your feet. It can also cause ulcers in your mouth and make you feel generally unwell, although some people have no symptoms.

According to the Health Service Executive (HSE), the disease is very contagious and is common in children under 10 years of age. However, adolescents and adults can also be affected. The 1st symptoms of HFMD include fever and feeling unwell, loss of appetite, sore throat, and small red spots in the mouth, throat, and skin. Later symptoms include the following:

Mouth lesions
After 1-2 days, red spots in the mouth will develop into painful ulcers, particularly around the tongue, gums, and inside of the cheeks. It may be difficult to eat, drink, and swallow.

Skin rash
Any red spots on the skin will turn into a non-itchy rash over the following 1-2 days. The spots are flat or raised, sometimes with blisters, and smaller than chickenpox sores. The rash develops on the palms of the hands, the soles of the feet, and between the fingers and toes. In some cases, spots also develop on the buttocks and genitals.

To prevent HFMD,
- Always wash your hands after going to the toilet and handling nappies, and before preparing food. If your child has HFMD, encourage them to wash their hands regularly;
- Avoid sharing utensils with people who are infected with HFMD; and
- Make sure that shared work surfaces are clean.

The Department of Health's Centre for Health Protection (CHP) has launched an investigation into a case of severe enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection involving a primary school student. At the same time, the CHP urged the public and institutions to observe strict personal and environmental hygiene following the outbreak of hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) at a primary school in Tuen Mun.

The EV71 patient, an 11-year-old boy with good past health, had been having a fever, coughing, and a runny nose since [10 Oct 2018] before he was admitted to Tuen Mun Hospital on [3 Nov 2018], the CHP said.

He developed convulsion and upper-limb weakness on [4 Nov 2018] and was transferred to the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit on the same day. The CHP said he remained in critical condition.

The patient's rectal swab specimen tested positive for EV71 upon laboratory testing. The clinical diagnoses were EV71 infection and encephalomyelitis.

Initial inquiries found that the boy had no travel history during the incubation period. His father showed symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection recently, although he is now in a stable condition. The boy's other home contacts have remained asymptomatic.

The CHP's investigations revealed that there is an HFMD outbreak at Po Leung Kuk Fong Wong Kam Chuen Primary School in Tuen Mun, where the boy attended.

At least 8 boys, aged 11 to 12, have developed HFMD symptoms since [28 Oct 2018]. They all received medical attention and needed no hospitalization. They are now in stable condition.

Upon the CHP's recommendation, the school suspended classes for Primary 5 and 6 students from Thursday [8 Nov] to 21 Nov [2018], according to the school's website. The school has been placed under medical surveillance.

A spokesman for the CHP said EV71 is one of the causative agents for HFMD, and the infection can be transmitted from person to person by direct contact with nose and throat discharges, saliva, fluid from blisters, or the stool of the infected.

There have been 48 recorded cases of EV71 infection, including 3 with severe complications, in Hong Kong this year [2018], compared with 38 (2 with severe complications) last year [2017], according to official data.

The spokesman said although the usual peak season for HFMD and EV71 infection is from May to July, a smaller peak may also occur from October to December.

As young children are more susceptible, parents should be mindful of their health and physical condition, the spokesman said, adding that "institutional outbreaks may occur where HFMD can easily spread among young children with close contact."

[Hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) is a common disease in children caused by enteroviruses such as coxsackieviruses and enterovirus 71 (EV71). The EV71 infection is of particular concern, as it more likely associates with severe outcomes (like viral meningitis, encephalitis, poliomyelitis-like paralysis) and even death. The usual peak season for HFMD in Hong Kong is from early summer to autumn, and a smaller peak may also occur in winter [https://www.chp.gov.hk/en/healthtopics/content/24/23.html].

During the recent outbreak, according to the EV surveillance data from Centre for Health Protection (CHP), a total of 367 cases have been reported as of 8 Nov 2018, with 48 cases confirmed due to EV71 [https://www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/evbdo_evscan_2018_week_45_eng.pdf]. The disease is most contagious during the 1st week of the illness, and the viruses can be found in stool for weeks. It mainly spreads by contact with nose or throat discharges, saliva, fluid from vesicles, or patients' stool, or after touching contaminated objects. - Mod.UBA
