Chickenpox cases have soared in Perth this year [2011], with outbreaks
of the highly contagious viral disease being reported in schools and
even affecting vaccinated children. Latest figures show 176 cases of
chickenpox, a notifiable disease, had been recorded in the
metropolitan area for the year to 12 Aug 2011. At the same time last
year, 120 cases had been reported to the health authority.

Chickenpox, which is spread by airborne droplets, usually causes tiny
blisters, a rash and mild fever. It can lead to complications in
teenagers and adults, such as potentially fatal brain inflammation or
pneumonia. In pregnant women, it can lead to birth defects or
increased risk of babies' deaths.

Western Australian children can have a free chickenpox vaccine at 18
months or when they are in Year 7 at school. "One dose of varicella
vaccine provides around 80-85 per cent protection against infection,
meaning that some vaccinated children may still get chickenpox
infections when the disease is prevalent," a Health Department
spokesman said yesterday [23 Aug 2011]. "However, their infections are
milder on average than those in unvaccinated children."

He said chickenpox outbreaks continued because many children had not
yet been vaccinated. The vaccine was introduced only recently. The
Health Department confirmed yesterday [23 Aug 2011] that 5 children at
John Septimus Roe School were reported to have chickenpox. Parents
were advised to keep infected children away from school for at least 5
days after the rash appeared and spots had formed crusts.

[Chickenpox (varicella), is caused by Varicella virus -- a herpes
virus -- and is found worldwide (see ProMED-mail references below),
with most infections occurring during childhood in temperate climates.
Chickenpox is highly infectious and spreads from person to person by
direct contact or through the air from an infected person's coughing
or sneezing or from aerosolisation of virus from skin lesions. A
person with chickenpox is contagious 1-2 days before the rash appears
and until all blisters have formed scabs. It takes from 10-21 days
after exposure for someone to develop chickenpox.

About 15-20 percent of people who have received one dose of chickenpox
vaccine do still get chickenpox if they are exposed, but their disease
is usually mild. In 2006, the US Advisory Committee on Immunization
Practices (ACIP) recommended routine 2-dose varicella vaccination for
all children.

In unvaccinated children, chickenpox most commonly causes an illness
that lasts about 5-10 days. Children usually miss 5 or 6 days of
school or childcare due to their chickenpox and have symptoms such as
high fever, severe itching, an uncomfortable rash, and dehydration or
headache. In addition, about one in 10 unvaccinated children who get
the disease will have a complication from chickenpox serious enough to
visit a health-care provider. These complications include infected
skin lesions, other infections, dehydration from vomiting or diarrhea,
or more serious complications such as pneumonia and encephalitis.

Certain groups of people are more likely to have more severe illness
with serious complications. These include adults, infants,
adolescents, and people whose immune systems have been weakened
because of illness or medications such as long-term use of steroids.
