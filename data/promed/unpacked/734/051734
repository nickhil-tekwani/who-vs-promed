Irish breeding centre hit by IBR outbreak
-----------------------------------------
As many as 50 of Ireland's top breeding bulls are facing slaughter
following an outbreak of Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis (IBR) at
the country's National Cattle Breeding Centre in Enfield, County Meath.

Top-ranked dairy bulls on the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation's
Spring sire list are among those affected, as are some top beef bulls,
including Charolais, Limousin, Angus and Hereford. Staff at the centre
are said to be shocked by the scale of the outbreak, with a management
spokesman describing the situation as 'a nightmare.'

Virology experts from the Department of Agriculture have been drafted
into the centre to try to establish the source of the highly
contagious disease, which causes pneumonia-type symptoms among cattle
but is said not to pose any significant threat to human health.
Following earlier alarms, strict security is in place at the centre,
including compulsory showering for staff, and one theory being
examined is that some of the bulls may have had a latent form of IBR
when they 1st arrived.

In addition to losing its best bulls, the centre will also have to
dump some 70 000 doses of semen, valued at around 500 000 euros [USD
684 650]. "As a precautionary measure, we will be discarding all the
semen collected since our last clear test," said breeding centre chief
executive Bernard Eivers.

However, he was quick to allay farmers' fears about Spring breeding by
insisting that there are sufficient supplies in stock to meet demand.
"Customers can be assured that there will not be a problem with
supplies during the upcoming breeding season," he said, "and that all
semen in stock is of the highest health standard."

This latest IBR outbreak, following others in recent years, is a major
embarrassment for the Irish industry and damaging to the 'clean and
green' image used to promote Irish beef and dairy products on export
markets, including the UK. Given the high level of infection among
Irish herds, questions are being asked about the lack of an IBR
eradication programme, similar to those which have eliminated the
disease in many countries across Europe.

One of the harshest critics is an Irishman, Prof Patrick Wall, former
chairman of the European Food Safety Authority. Following an earlier
IBR outbreak, he said the Irish industry should "seriously examine if
it is 'best in class' when it comes to animal health status." And he
went on to warn: "Time is not on our side in the competitive global
market place and export contracts lost are hard to win back."

[An outbreak of IBR in an AI (Artificial insemination) centre can
indeed be regarded as very concerning; this herpes virus is readily
transmitted and widely spread by infected semen. For background on the
scope and ramifications of NCBC Ireland Genetics, the affected
enterprise, subscribers may wish to visit its website at
<http://www.ncbc.ie/>; see "latest news." Dr Patrick wall's comment
deserves attention (notably, Dr Wall is MD and DVM).

IBR is not zoonotic.

The following information (summarised) on this OIE-listed bovine
disease is derived from the introduction to chapter 2.4.13.
'INFECTIOUS BOVINE RHINOTRACHEITIS/INFECTIOUS PUSTULAR VULVOVAGINITIS'
of OIE's Terrestrial Manual:

"Definition of the disease:
Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis/infectious pustular vulvovaginitis
(IBR/IPV), caused by bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1), is a disease of
domestic and wild cattle. The virus is distributed world-wide, but has
been eradicated from Austria, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Italy
(Province of Bolzano), Switzerland, Norway and parts of Germany (the
'Oberfranken' and 'Oberpfalz' districts of Bavaria). Control
programmes are running in several other countries, for example in
Germany and Italy.

"Description of disease:
The disease is characterised by clinical signs of the upper
respiratory tract, such as a (muco)purulent nasal discharge,
hyperaemia of the muzzle (red nose disease) and by conjunctivitis.
Signs of general illness are fever, depression, inappetence, abortions
and reduced milk yield. The virus can also infect the genital tract
and cause pustular vulvovaginitis and balanoposthitis. Post-mortem
examinations reveal rhinitis, laryngitis and tracheitis. Mortality is
low, and most infections run a subclinical course. Secondary bacterial
infections can lead to more severe respiratory disease, and BoHV-1
could play a role in multifactor diseases such as 'shipping fever'.

"Identification of the agent:
The virus can be isolated from nasal or genital swabs from animals
with respiratory signs, vulvovaginitis or balanoposthitis, taken
during the acute phase of the infection, and, in severe cases, from
various organs collected at post-mortem. Following infection, BoHV-1
may persist in infected animals in a latent state in sensory neurons;
e.g.; in the trigeminal or sacral ganglia. The virus can be
reactivated and this results in virus shedding (re-excretion) without
exhibition of clinical disease. Therefore, antibody-positive animals
have to be classified as infected with BoHV-1 (with 2 exceptions:
serological responses induced by vaccination with an inactivated
vaccine or by colostral antibodies).

"BoHV-1 isolates can be subtyped by DNA restriction enzyme analysis
(RFLP) into subtypes 1.1 and 1.2. BoHV-1.2 isolates can be further
differentiated into 2a and 2b. Development of rhinotracheitis or
vulvovaginitis/balanoposthitis depends more on the route of infection
than on the subtype of the virus. The virus previously referred to as
BoHV-1.3, a neuropathogenic agent, is now classified as BoHV-5.

"Viral DNA detection methods have been developed, and the polymerase
chain reaction technique is increasingly used in routine diagnosis
including real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

"Serological tests: The virus neutralisation test and various
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA; indirect or gB-blocking)
are most widely used for antibody detection. With the ELISAs,
antibodies can be detected in serum or plasma, and with lower
sensitivity in milk or bulk milk samples.

"Requirements for vaccines and diagnostic biologicals:
Inactivated and attenuated live vaccines are available. The vaccines
protect cattle clinically in case of infection and markedly reduce the
subsequent shedding of field virus. Although vaccination may not
prevent field virus infection of individual animals, spreading of
wild-type virus in infected herds is efficiently reduced. The vaccines
must not induce disease, abortion, or any local or systemic reaction,
and must be genetically stable.

"BoHV-1 glycoprotein E deleted mutant marker vaccines are now
generally available (live or inactivated). The use of a
gE-antibody-ELISA makes it possible to distinguish field virus
infected cattle from cattle vaccinated with such a marker vaccine
(DIVA strategy)."

chapter, which was adopted by the World Assembly of Delegates of the
OIE in May 2010, available at
<http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.04.13_IBR_IPV.pdf>.

According to Article 11.11.7. of OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code,
Veterinary Authorities of countries which import frozen bovine semen
should require the presentation of an international veterinary
certificate attesting that:

1. the donor animals were kept in an IBR/IPV free herd at the time of
collection of the semen; or

2. the donor animals were held in isolation during the period of
collection and for the 30 days following collection and were subjected
to a diagnostic test for IBR/IPV on a blood sample taken at least 21
days after collection of the semen, with negative results; or

3. if the serological status of the bull is unknown or if the bull is
serologically positive, an aliquot of each semen collection was
subjected to a virus isolation test or PCR, performed in accordance
with the Terrestrial Manual, with negative results; and

4. the semen was collected, processed and stored in conformity with
the provisions of Chapters 4.5. and 4.6.*
