A new study published in Veterinary Microbiology found
methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA) is widely common
in Canadian pig farms and pig farmers, signaling to some that animal
agriculture as a source of the deadly bacteria. The Veterinary
Microbiology study (Khanna et al. Veterinary Medicine 2007) is the
1st to show that North American pig farms and farmers commonly carry MRSA.

Researchers looked for MRSA in 285 pigs in 20 Ontario farms and found
MRSA at 45 percent of farms (9/20) and in nearly one in 4 pigs
(71/285). One in 5 pig farmers studied (5/25) also were found to
carry MRSA, a much higher rate than in the general North American
population. The strains of MRSA bacteria found in Ontario pigs and
pig farmers included a strain common to human MRSA infections in Canada.

A study published last month [October 2007] in the Journal of the
American Medical Association (JAMA) (Klevens et al: Invasive
methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ infections in the
United States JAMA 2007; 298: 1753-1771) estimated almost 100 000
MRSA infections in 2005, and nearly 19 000 deaths in the United
States. In comparison, HIV/AIDS killed 17 000 people that year.

With the recent outbreak of the deadly disease researchers generally
believed MRSA as an opportunistic infection occurring mainly in
hospitals. However more information is coming to light that finds
even healthy people are developing MRSA infections and pig farms may
be a possible culprit. Now some experts in the in the medical,
agriculture, and environmental industries are calling for Congress to
compel the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to study whether the
use of human antibiotics in animal agriculture is contributing to the
reported surge in MRSA infections and deaths in the United States.

"Identifying and controlling community sources of MRSA is a public
health priority of the 1st order," said Richard Wood, Executive
Director of Food Animal Concerns Trust and Steering Committee Chair
of Keep Antibiotics Working. "Are livestock farmers and farms in the
United States also sources? We don't know for sure, because the US
government is not systematically testing US livestock for MRSA."

"Last summer, when we raised the MRSA issue, the FDA told us that it
had no plans to sample US livestock to see if they carry MRSA," said
David Wallinga, MD, Director of the Institute for Agriculture and
Trade Policy's Food and Health Program. "Given the latest science
that hog farms may generate MRSA, we need Congress to give FDA and
other relevant agencies the necessary funding and a sense of urgency.
Sampling needs to be done as soon as possible."

In Europe, MRSA has been shown to be transmitted from pigs to
farmers, their families, veterinarians, and hospital staff treating
farm-infected patients. The same pig strain that was detected in
Canada has been associated in Europe with serious human illness
including skin, wound, breast, and heart infections, as well as pneumonia.

Proposed federal legislation, The Preservation of Antibiotics for
Medical Treatment Act, sponsored by Senate Health Committee Chairman
Edward Kennedy (D-MA) and Senators Olympia Snowe (R-ME), Susan
Collins (R-ME), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), and Jack Reed (D-RI) in the
Senate (S. 549) and Rep. Louise Slaughter (D-NY), the only
microbiologist in Congress, and 34 other House members in the US
House of Representatives (H.R. 962), would phase out the use of
antibiotics that are important in human medicine as animal feed
additives within 2 years.

[Reports of MRSA infection and colonization in companion animals and
their human owners have appeared in the past few years (see
<http://www.infectiousdiseasenews.com/200606/darwin.asp>), as well as
have reports of MRSA in service dogs in nursing homes where MRSA is
endemic
(<http://www.newsday.com/news/health/ny-hspets295437222oct29,0,7605571.story>)
and in horses and people who work with the horses (see ProMED-mail
20070108.0076).

The transmission of MRSA from people to animals has been described as
an example of a "reverse zoonosis" (see ProMED-mail 20011225.3111 and
20011223.3103). MRSA has been described in other domestic animals
such as cats, cattle, sheep, chickens, and rabbits
(<http://www.medvetnet.org/cms/templates/doc.php?id=106>).

_S. aureus_ has been isolated from 66 percent of 444 samples of raw
chicken meat from 131 of 145 supermarkets in 47 prefectures
throughout Japan (S. Kitai et al, J Vet Med Sci 2005; 67: 107-10).
The frequency of MRSA isolation was, however, low -- only 2 of the
292 isolates were MRSA, which contained the SCCmec (staphylococcal
cassette chromosome mec) type IV gene (prevalent in
community-acquired MRSA) and belonged to a biovar that is
characteristic of strains of human origin. This suggested to the
authors that the 2 MRSA isolates were transmitted incidentally by
workers handling raw chicken meat during processing. The authors
stated that MRSA had not been previously isolated from samples of
chicken, beef, or pork meat.

Similarly in Korea, among 1913 specimens collected from the animals,
421 contained _S. aureus_; but only 28 of these contained _S. aureus_
resistant to concentrations of oxacillin higher than 2 microgm/ml.
Isolates from 15 of the 28 specimens were positive by PCR (polymerase
chain reaction) for the mecA gene, confirming that they were MRSA. Of
the 15 mecA-positive MRSA isolates, 12 were from dairy cows and 3
were from chickens. The authors found that genotype of 6 of the MRSA
isolates from animals were identical to the patterns of certain
isolates from humans. (JH Lee et al. Appl Environ Microbiol 2006; 69:
6489-6494).

In contrast in Europe, a high percentage of Dutch pig farms (85
percent) had pigs that carried MRSA and 39 percent of slaughtered
pigs carried MRSA (deNeeling et al. Vet Microbiol 2007; 122: 366-72
and van Duijkeren et al. Vet Microbiol. 2007 Jul 25; [Epub ahead of
print]). In addition, in Europe, MRSA has been shown to spread from
pigs to farmers, their families and hospital staff treating
farm-infected patients (Witte et al Emerg Infect Dis 2007; 13: 255-8,
Huijsdens et al. Ann Clin Microbiol Antimicrob 2006; 5: 26-9, and
Voss et al. Emerg Infect Dis 2005; 11: 1965-6).

Khanna et al (Methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_
colonization in pigs and pig farmers. Veterinary Microbiology
doi:10.1016/j.vetmic.2007.10.006) are the 1st to show that North
American (Ontario) pig farms and farmers commonly carry MRSA. The
news release does not state whether there is a genetic relationship
between the human and pig MRSA isolates, although it states that
these strains "included a strain common to human MRSA infections in
Canada." However, the Khanna et al article states that there was a
correlation between the presence of MRSA in pigs and humans on farms
and that the predominant spa type in pigs and humans was type 539 and
related strains, and that these spa types found in Canada as having
"previously been reported as being clonal complex (CC) 398 (Witte et
al., 2007)" in Europe. The 2nd most common spa type was type 2,
"classified as Canadian epidemic MRSA-2 (CMRSA-2), also known as
USA-100," the most common community-associated MRSA strain in humans
in Canada. The link between MRSA in the food animals and its presence
in the community is disturbing, although more information is needed. - Mod.ML]
