In a new step in the fight to kill mosquitoes that transmit St Louis
encephalitis [SLE] virus, heavy fumigation equipment began to
circulate in the neighborhoods in specific areas of Greater San Juan,
attempting to kill adult insects [mosquitoes] in at least 9 blocks
around the homes of the latest suspected cases. These [suspected
cases] now total 13 (without counting the 5 confirmed infections), in
the [provincial] capital as well as in Santa Lucia, Chimbas, and now
Rawson, 5 days after Public Health issued an epidemiological alert.

On the other hand, according to information issued yesterday [4 Apr
2011] by Frida Cappato, head of epidemiology of the province, in
recent hours a suspected case was added in Rawson, so that now there
are 13 [suspected cases] under study and 4 departments of Greater San
Juan in which the virus is thought might be present. Last week [week
of 29 Mar 2011] when the Ministry of Health issued the epidemiological
alert, there were 5 confirmed cases, all in the [provincial] capital,
and 3 under study.

In addition to halting watering of street trees to avoid standing
water in ditches (the main site of breeding of the common mosquito,
called _Culex pipiens_), it was announced that in the cemeteries there
would be no water for flower vases, and meanwhile the Ministry of
Health stated that representatives of that office would visit homes to
deliver informative material, carry out disinfection if necessary, and
advise about trash (elimination of tires, cans, and objects that can
hold water).

[SLE virus transmission continues ins San Juan, with new suspected
cases in nearby areas. SLE virus had previously caused outbreaks in
the central part of Argentina (mainly in the provinces of Cordoba and
Entre Rios), and the 2010 cases were the 1st time that it had been
detected in Buenos Aires. The report above adds to the 1st report for
ProMED-mail in San Juan province, although the occurrence of cases is
not surprising, given sporadic cases in the central Argentina
provinces mentioned previously.
