For the 1st time the disease "Usutu" in wild birds has been reported in
Switzerland. The virus was detected in birds found dead, as published by
the University of Zurich on Fri 25 Aug 2006.
The affected species were blackbirds, sparrows and owls. By the end of July
2006 an increased number of dead blackbirds and sparrows was recognized in
the city of Zurich. In addition, several owls died in the zoo.
Influenza virus was ruled out as the causative agent. The cases were
investigated by the department for Zoo-, Small- and Wild Animals at the
Vetsuisse faculty of the Zurich University of Zurich, the institutes of
Veterinary Bacteriology and Veterinary Pathology of the universities of
Zurich and Berne, and the institute for Pathology and Forensic Veterinary
Medicine in Vienna. The investigations revealed the presence of Usutu virus
in the dead birds. The virus originates from Africa, was isolated several
times in mites in South America and found in Europe once during an outbreak
in Vienna in 2001.

[Usutu virus (USUV) is a flavivirus closely related to West Nile virus.
Subsequent to its 1st isolation in South Africa, it was isolated from
birds, mosquitoes and mammals, one from _Praomys_ (African soft-furred
rat), and one from a man with fever and rash. In Africa, the virus
circulates between birds and mosquitoes with mammals being inadvertent
hosts if bitten by infected mosquitoes. There are no reports of severe
disease in man.
USUV was known only in Africa prior to 2001, when it was isolated
unexpectedly from birds dying of encephalitis in Vienna, Austria. For
additional background, see 20040827.2394. - Mod.AS]
