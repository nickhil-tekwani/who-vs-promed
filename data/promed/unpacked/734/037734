Measles cases in England: January to March 2013
-----------------------------------------------
A total of 587 cases of measles with onset dates in the 1st quarter of 2013 (January to March) was confirmed in England. This continues the trend of monthly totals which are around the highest recorded since the enhanced surveillance commenced in 1994 and follows the highest annual figure over the same period of 1920 laboratory confirmed cases in 2012.

The age distribution of the cases in the 1st quarter of 2013 shows a peak in the 10-14 year old age group with an apparent shift in age, when compared to the previous 4 years. Analysis of cases by year of birth shows that, apart from children born in 2012 (who would be too young to be eligible for vaccination); attack rates are higher in the cohorts born between 1997-2006 (now aged 7-16 years) with the highest attack rates in individuals born in 2000 (now aged 12/13 years).

The 587 cases are distributed across England, although the north-west and north-east have the highest totals. The geographical pattern does not suggest widespread circulation across the country. Cases are still being reported from "hard-to-reach" populations with known low coverage (travelling community - 81 cases, Orthodox Jewish population - 41 cases); and 119 (20%) cases were associated with school outbreaks. In school outbreaks, the overall attack rate has been just below 1% with limited ongoing spread.

Overall around 18% of all cases in England were admitted to hospital; of the 108 cases admitted to hospital 15 of these experienced complications such as pneumonia, meningitis and gastroenteritis.

Although the incidence of measles appears to be sustained at a high level, a substantial proportion of cases are still associated with known low coverage groups. The predominance of cases being confirmed in secondary school aged children from the general community is of particular concern. These cohorts have been most affected by the decline in MMR coverage in the early part of the century and are therefore a key priority group for targeted interventions.

To reduce the transmission and spread of measles, Public Health England in collaboration with the Department of Health and NHS England have announced a MMR catch-up programme which has 3 key components:

• an urgent, targeted communication strategy pushing unvaccinated young people towards primary care or other appropriate providers,

• a rapid active programme to identify and vaccinate unvaccinated and partially vaccinated 10-16 year olds,

• a sustained intervention over the longer term that will strengthen current routine approaches and specifically target vulnerable and underserved populations.

New surge in measles outbreak sparks call for Scots to be immunised
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Health chiefs in Scotland are urging parents to get their children vaccinated against measles after the number of cases south of the Border soared past 1500. Scottish health boards say they have so far avoided any significant outbreaks of the potentially deadly condition with just 16 cases recorded across the country. But with cases still spreading in England and Wales ahead of the forthcoming exam period and school holidays medics say there is no room for complacency in trying to contain the situation.

Health experts in Wales are preparing to enter their 3rd week of holding MMR clinics at schools and children are being urged to get immunised before their exams begin. The number of people that have contracted the disease in the south-west of
the country [Wales} now stands at 942 with some 83 people being admitted to hospital since the outbreak began.

On Thursday [25 Apr 2013] Chief Medical Officer Sir Harry Burns announced older children in Scotland were being offered the MMR vaccine. Uptake rate for the MMR vaccine in Scotland currently remains above the World Health Organisation's target of 95 percent with 97.1 percent of children vaccinated before they reach their 5th birthday. Wales is also hitting this 95 percent target. England is just below it at 94 percent.

Even so, there have been 16 laboratory confirmed cases in Scotland since the start of the year, a figure Health Protection Scotland says might indicate that the outbreaks in England and Wales are unlikely to be mirrored on a similar scale in Scotland. Dr Kevin Pollock, senior epidemiologist and research lead at Health Protection Scotland said: "In Wales, their vaccine uptake in those under the age one is similar to Scotland. "The problem is not the uptake rate of the younger children at the moment. "It is instead those children who didn't get the MMR vaccine over a decade ago when the parents decided that they didn't want to get that vaccine.
"In Wales, between 2000 to 2002, the MMR vaccination uptake rate was 70 percent. During the same time period in Scotland, this was 87 percent. "This was partly based on Wakefield's study and also because in Swansea, there was a local media campaign against the vaccine which had a big effect on the uptake. "The risks in Scotland are therefore much lower."

Around 18 months ago, children between 10 & 17 in Scotland were given a further chance to have the MMR vaccination in schools when the Secondary 3 booster was offered. In light of the outbreaks in England and Wales, NHS boards across the
country will now write to parents of all unvaccinated or partially vaccinated children aged 10 to 17 with an invitation to attend for vaccination over the next few weeks. Strongly supporting the plea, NHS 24 medical director Professor Crooks said: "Measles is not a minor condition of childhood that only causes a rash. "It is potentially serious and occasionally tragically fatal condition. Immunisation protects people against measles but you have to have the full course, one injection is not enough."

[3] UK (Wales): 1st fatality

Measles outbreak could hit 1000 at its peak, warn doctors
---------------------------------------------------------
Measles cases were expected to show another rise today [Tue 23 Apr 2023], when health officials announce the latest figures revealing the scale of the outbreak in Wales. Officials warned the outbreak could soon become the biggest in UK and Ireland for a generation, and may hit 1000 cases by the time it peaks. Shadow Health Minister Darrren Millar last night called on parents throughout North Wales to listen to public health professionals. There are over 10 000 children who are not fully protected by the vaccine in the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board area and at risk of contracting measles. Mr Millar said: "This is a very serious situation as although the outbreak has centred on the Swansea area, cases have been detected across Wales." Clinics will be held at 10 schools in the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board (ABMU) area throughout this week while Cwm Taf Health Board will be visiting 3 schools in the region.

Health officials at Cardiff and Vale University Health Board (UHB) also held top-level meetings yesterday to thrash out a vaccination programme for schools in its area. A spokesman for the board urged parents to sign and return consent forms for unvaccinated children to get their jabs as soon as possible.

1st fatality
------------
Meanwhile, the results of a post mortem examination on a man found dead at his Swansea home on Thursday morning are expected later this week. Gareth Colfer-Williams, 25, was suffering from measles when he died, and is the 1st fatality to be linked with the disease. Last week the epidemic, which is centred on the Swansea area, reached 808, with 20 new cases being seen every day. Latest figures are due to be released by Public Health Wales (PHW) on Tuesday and are expected to show a significant rise as the outbreak continues to show no signs of slowing down.

Officials have warned that it is now at risk of becoming the biggest outbreak in the UK and Ireland since the introduction of the MMR in 1988. The largest outbreak was seen in 1999-2000 when 1200 people were affected in Dublin and 3 died. A PHW spokeswoman said: "We are definitely expecting to reach 1000 cases as we are seeing 20 new cases a day, which will take us up to around 950 by the end of next week."

An increase in the incidence of measles began in February [2013] and continued until the present. The chief medical officer of Zelenograd Leonid Denisov, is calling the situation "complex." Since the end of February more than 20 people were diagnosed with measles and new cases are being identified. It affects children and adults, including staff of the Zelenograd hospital.

Doctors are trying to vaccinate all who had contact with the infected: co-workers, neighbors. The infected were in contact with more than 1000 people, nearly half of them children, including 60 infants under 1 year old who cannot be vaccinated against measles. 80 percent of children older 1 year old are vaccinated. In total about 2500 people were vaccinated over the past 3 months. [Protective target is 95 percent -- see Comment at end. - Mod.JW]

A Number of the staff in the Zelenograd hospital contracted measles from one of the patients hopsitalised in April. The last outbreak of measles in Zelenograd was recorded in late 2011 - early 2012. Prior to that, from 2008, cases of measles in the county were not recorded

[More than 20 people with measles were registered in Zelenograd, a city in Moscow Province, among them both adults and children. Sincere there were cases of measles infection that took place in the hospital, health personnel should be vaccinated against measles. In addition all adults and children older than 14 years of age (ideally all the seronegative population) should be vaccinated against measles too.

------------------------------------------------------------------
The WHO epidemiologist in charge of emergencies and Humanitarian actions in Orientale Province, Colin Ngobila, said Monday, 22 Apr 2013, that 82 cases of measles have been reported since March [2013] in the Health zones of Duruma, Dungu, Aba and Faradje in Haut-Uele district (Orientale Province). Epidemiologist Ngobila called for a strengthening of the Expanded Vaccination Programme (PEV in French) in these health areas. He declared that: "We promote the proper management of cases including vitamin therapy and we also require strengthening of the routine Systematic PEV, i.e. the PEV routine vaccination that is given to children before their first birthday."

Cases of Measles Have Been Detected in Northern Syria and in the Refugee Camps
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UOSSM [Union of Syrian Medical Relief Organisations] reports that more than 40 cases of measles have been detected in North Syria and the refugee camps, distributed as follow: 10 cases of measles in Aleppo, 2 of them fatal. A report by the Jordan Times recorded that 13 cases of measles have so far been detected among Syrian refugees in Jordan, accordion to a Health Ministry official (http://jordantimes.com/13-cases-of-measles-detected-among-syrian-refugees).

Dr Tawfik Chamaa, UOSSM spokesperson, said; "Measles is one of the most contagious, and deadly of all childhood diseases. However, it is preventable by vaccination. It is very imperative to undertake a wide campaign of vaccination to the displaced Syrian children, and those in the refugee camps. Those children have already missed their vaccination schedule due to displacement and the ceasation of vaccination programs in several areas across Syria, in addition to the high susceptibility among children to acquiring infectious disease, due to the harsh environmental conditions, the crowded area in the refugee camps, and the poor nutritional status many of them are suffering from." Dr Chamaa, added, " We call on WHO and UNICEF to conduct an urgent wide vaccination program on Syrian children, inside Syria and in the refugee camps."

UOSSM expresses its gratitude to the Jordanian Ministry of Health, Abdullat, for launching the initiative campaign to vaccinate the Syrian children in [the] refugee camp, according to the Jordan Times,"on Saturday to inoculate 90 000 Syrian refugees against measles and 24 000 against polio. In addition, 22 000 will receive vitamin A doses. Since the launch of the campaign, 3528 Syrians have been vaccinated against polio and 23 000 against measles, while 6985 were given vitamin A."

The UOSSM is a coalition of humanitarian and non-governmental organizations, created following the deadly events in Syria, to provide medical and humanitarian aid to Syrians. UOSSM was established by 14 organizations, and includes hundreds of physicians of mainly Syrian origin distributed in the United States, Canada, Europe and in different Arab countries.

The epidemic isn't near; it's already here
------------------------------------------
It's easy to get lost in the numbers. Easy to forget that every digit is a life put in danger, or a life lost. Less than 4 months into this year, there have already been 25 401 reported cases of measles. Thus far, 146 children across the country have lost their lives due to this easily preventable disease, and there are fears that this may only percent be the beginning.

Documents obtained by The Express Tribune paint a grim picture of what lies ahead: out of 7000-plus laboratory confirmed measles cases that surfaced in 2012, a staggering 60 percent of children were not given even a single dose of measles vaccine, while 20 percent were vaccinated with only one dose. Of those confirmed cases, 68 percent were below 5 years of age and 32 per cent were less than 10. The country's official estimate of 1st and 2nd dose measles vaccine coverage was 75 percent and 53 percent in 2011 and 80 percent and 53 percent in 2012, respectively. Not only are the numbers of immunised children declining alarmingly, the actual coverage is considered to be far lower than what the official figures claim. This is evident, the documents say, from the thousands of measles cases that have
emerged across the country from 2012 until now.

"These shocking statistics clearly reflect the main reason behind the measles outbreak in the country and the utter failure to ensure optimal coverage of routine immunisation," said an Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) official who wished not to be named. "With such poor and embarrassing coverage what message are we giving to theworld on the eve of World Immunisation Week, which starts from 24 April [2013]?" he asks.

It's not as if there wasn't ample warning, he says. The recent outbreak in Sindh should have been a wake-up call, but those responsible just kept sleeping, with the result that the epidemic travelled to Punjab. Now, Punjab tops the list with 16 608 cases and Sindh leads with 62 deaths. "The provincial and federal governments' attitude is clearly reflected by their delay in releasing the amount allocated to launch emergency measles Supplemental Immunisation Activities (SIA) in flood-prone areas by June 2013," said the official.

The total amount required for SIA is $65 million, out of which $35 million is being paid by the Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI), a global health partnership, while the Pakistani government has to generate the remaining $30 million. International donors have given a cold shoulder to Pakistan, and thus far Punjab has allocated $14 million and Sindh $4 million. Neither province has actually released the amount yet. Balochistan has not yet shown any interest while the federal government has requested the finance ministry for financial assistance but has not yet received any response. "If Pakistan fails to raise this amount by the end of May [2013], then it will be impossible to carry out the SIAs in the country and the lives of over 62 million children between the ages of 9 months to 10 years will be at risk," he warned.

World Health Organisation's (WHO) focal person on the measles outbreak in Pakistan, Dr Qamarul Hasan, said the reason for the epidemic is because children are either not vaccinated at all or only partially vaccinated. "Pakistan is one of the top 5 countries in the world having the highest number of unvaccinated children. Of course, no sensible mind can say this is a satisfactory achievement," he said. Suggesting steps to control the epidemic, he said the WHO recommends improving both the 1st and 2nd dose coverage to at least 95%, and then sustaining that level. Along with this, he says a nation-wide measles campaign has to be launched targeting all children below 10 years. And finally, Hasan said the government needs to ensure accountability at all levels for the effective and efficient utilisation of its own and donors' resources. At this point in time, none of these measures seem to be being carried out, and every passing day only increases the danger to Pakistan's children.

Health officials urge vaccination after measles outbreak in Stokes and Orange counties
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Local health departments and the N.C. Department of Public Health are working together to investigate an outbreak of measles.

8 cases, including 3 adults and 5 children, have been identified in Stokes and Orange Counties; 7 of the 8 cases identified had not been previously vaccinated against the measles.

Measles is very uncommon in the United States and is prevented through vaccine. It remains a common disease in many parts of the world, including areas in Europe, Asia, the Pacific, Africa and the Americas. Most of the measles cases that occur in the USA result from international travel by people who are typically not vaccinated against measles and get infected in other countries. Measles can be prevented by the combination MMR (measles, mumps & rubella) vaccine. It is important for all people 12 months of age and older to be vaccinated. These 3 vaccines are safe given together and are usually given in 2 separate doses to ensure effectiveness.

"Although measles is rare, it's important for everyone to know the signs, symptoms, and how to prevent it. The best protection is vaccination. Check to make sure you and your children are up-to-date on the MMR. If not, call your doctor or the health department," Barbara Ellis, public health director for the Rowan County Health Department, said in a news release.

For more information, contact the Rowan County Health Department at; 704-216-8777. Also visit http://epi.publichealth.nc.gov/cd/diseases/rubeola.html

More measles cases reported in Orange County
--------------------------------------------
4 more measles cases have been diagnosed in Orange County, public health officials said Friday. The 3 children and one adult are in addition to one child who was diagnosed last week. The children are all 9-11 years old. Officials said they don't believe the children were exposed to the disease at school. All of the new cases are among the contacts with the initial case in the county, and they were already in quarantine and will remain isolated at home, officials said.

14 measles cases have been diagnosed statewide in recent weeks, with a separate outbreak in Stokes County. Measles is a highly contagious disease that is spread through the air by coughing and sneezing. It also can be transmitted through contact with secretions from the nose or mouth of an infected person. Initial symptoms may include fever, runny nose, watery red eyes and cough. After a few days, a rash appears on the head and spreads over the entire body. Measles can be prevented by the combination MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine. It is important for all individuals 12 months of age and older to be vaccinated.
