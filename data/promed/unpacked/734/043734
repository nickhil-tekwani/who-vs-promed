An unknown disease has ruined paddy plants across 30 villages of Chingai Block in Ukhrul district [state of Manipur], the [local] Village Development Committee said.

[A] similar disease had destroyed the paddy plants at Chingai last year [2012], and the infestation of this mysterious disease has made farmers apprehensive. The villagers have to purchase rice, as their crops failed last year [2012] due to that unknown disease. However, the State Government did not render any assistance.

The farmers are now worried over mass destruction of paddy plants. The Agriculture Department should take up effective measures to control the spread of such unknown diseases, the Committee urged.
