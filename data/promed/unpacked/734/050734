Rising COVID-19 infections in China's city of Xian have spurred a lockdown of its 13 million residents, with stretches of highway eerily bare on Thursday [23 Dec 2021], as many people queued in the cold to get their noses swabbed at testing sites.

The daily count of domestically transmitted infections with confirmed symptoms in the northwestern city, famed for its terracotta warriors buried with China's 1st emperor, has increased for 6 straight days since 17 Dec 2021. That takes the tally of local cases to more than 200 over the period from 9-22 Dec 2021, smaller than many outbreaks outside China. No omicron infection has yet been found in Xian, capital of the northwestern province of Shaanxi.

But consistent with Beijing's stance that no flareup can be allowed to spread, Xian has made it hard for residents to leave. Those who want to leave must test negative before departure and get clearance from employers or community-level authorities.

The city has suspended long-distance bus services and banned out-of-town trips by taxis and cars hired on ride-hailing platforms, posting police at highway exits to dissuade trips authorities consider unnecessary. From Thursday [23 Dec 2021], each household may send only one person to shop for necessities every 2 days, while others may not leave unless they have essential jobs. Video images livestreamed by traffic police on social media showed some stretches of highway in Xian were nearly deserted.

The city has launched multiple rounds of mass testing. One student at a university based in the city said she lined up outdoors for about an hour while it snowed, in order to give a sample for a COVID-19 test. "The indoor gymnasium is not big enough, and the testing demand is huge," said the student, [Z]. "Temporary sites were set up in an outdoor sports field."

LONGi Green Technology Co., the world's biggest monocrystalline silicon solar maker, said production at its factories in Xian had not been affected. The factories have met the disinfection and virus prevention requirements set by Xian authorities, with workers now in "closed-off management," LONGi told investors on an online platform backed by the Shanghai stock exchange.

All domestic flights with Xian scheduled for Thursday [23 Dec 2021] have been cancelled, data from flight data services firm Variflight show, though outbound flights for Friday [24 Dec 2021] are still available, according to online travel booking apps.

South of Shaanxi, the province of Sichuan and the city of Chongqing demanded that recent visitors to Xian be quarantined for up to 14 days before they could travel freely.

For Wednesday [22 Dec 2021], mainland China confirmed 71 local symptomatic cases, 63 of them in Xian, the National Health Commission said in a statement. Mainland China had 100 644 confirmed cases by Wednesday, both local and among international travellers. The nationwide death toll was unchanged at 4636.

https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/12/23/1066871176/mask-n95-omicron-contagious


With another coronavirus variant racing across the United States, once again health authorities are urging people to mask up indoors. Yes, you've heard it all before. But given how contagious omicron is, experts say, it's seriously time to upgrade to an N95 or similar high-filtration respirator when you're in public indoor spaces. "Cloth masks are not going to cut it with omicron," says Linsey Marr, a researcher at Virginia Tech who studies how viruses transmit in the air.

Omicron is so much more transmissible than coronavirus variants that have come before it. It spreads at least 3 times faster than delta. One person is infecting at least 3 others at a time on average, based on data from other countries.

"It's very contagious," says Dr. Robert Wachter, chair of the Department of Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. "And the kind of encounter that you could have had with prior versions of the virus that would have left you uninfected, there's now a good chance you will get infected from it."

True, a cloth mask can be a "marginally OK to maybe a decent filter," Marr says. But with something as highly transmissible as omicron, just "OK" isn't good enough.

Marr notes that preliminary data from scientists at the University of Hong Kong have shown that omicron multiplies 70 times faster inside human respiratory tract tissue than the delta variant does. That study also found that omicron reaches higher levels in respiratory tract tissue 48 hours after infection, compared with delta.

"That would suggest to me that maybe it reaches higher levels and then we spew out more [virus particles] if we're infected," Marr says. And while it's too soon to tell, she says it's conceivable that omicron is so good at infecting us, we just need to breathe in fewer viral particles of omicron to get infected.

And virus particles from an infectious person can linger in the air indoors for minutes or even hours after they leave a room in some situations, says Dr. Abraar Karan, an infectious disease physician at Stanford University. "I think that people need to realize that transmission here can happen even when you're not near somebody," he says.

Given all this, you want a mask that means business when it comes to blocking viral particles. Unlike cloth masks, N95, KN95 and KF94 respirators are all made out of material with an electrostatic charge, which "actually pulls these particles in as they're floating around and prevents you from inhaling those particles," Karan notes. "And that really is key" -- because if you don't inhale virus particles, they can't multiply in your respiratory tract.

The material in surgical masks also has an electrostatic charge. But surgical masks tend to fit loosely, and a snug fit -- with no gaps around nose, cheeks or chin -- "really makes a big difference," says Marr, who has studied mask efficacy.

KN95s tend to be a bit more comfortable than N95s, but counterfeits continue to be a problem. For safer shopping, check out a site like Project N95, a nonprofit that helps consumers find legitimate personal protective equipment (https://www.projectn95.org/). Or check the CDC's site for advice on how to spot a counterfeit (https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/index.htm) and a list of trusted sources for surgical N95s (https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/respsource3surgicaln95.html).

For maximum protection, make sure your N95 fits snugly as well, creating a seal around your mouth and nose. The CDC explains what makes a good fit (https://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2020/03/16/n95-preparedness/) and how to test that yours is sealing well (https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2018-130/pdfs/2018-130.pdf?id=10.26616/NIOSHPUB2018130).

Still, surgical masks are cheaper than respirators. And if cost is a factor for you, at a minimum consider topping a surgical mask with a cloth mask to ensure a tighter fit, or get a mask fitter -- a frame that fits over your surgical mask to make it more snug. While these options won't offer as much protection as an N95, they're a big improvement over a cloth mask alone, Karan and Marr say.

As to when to wear a mask, obviously you want to cover up when you're using public transit, including airports and airplanes, and when you're indoors in grocery stores or other public places, as with previous surges. Check to see whether where you live has a lot of cases -- most places do right now.

Wachter says he's also covering up indoors with small groups of friends and family unless everyone is vaccinated and boosted. If they're not boosted, he says, "I consider them to be somewhere between vaccinated and unvaccinated, and I act appropriately if I'm going to be around them." That means he either has everyone mask up, or he has everyone take a rapid test to make sure no one is infectious at that moment. "One or the other." This is especially important if anyone attending is high risk.

Marr says that with omicron surging, she'd have kids wear respirators if possible when they're indoors in public spaces. Parents searching for good respirator options for their children can check out the work of Aaron Collins, aka "Mask Nerd," a mechanical engineer with a background in aerosol science. He's been testing the filtration efficiencies of hundreds of masks and respirators on the market. You can find his reviews on his YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3fF_rzkmZD0ufN685YE7lg). (This spreadsheet on kids' masks may also be helpful: https://bit.ly/3yVxm9n).

Combined with getting vaccinated and boosted, upgrading to a high-filtration mask will be key to enjoying a safer holiday season without having to hibernate, experts say. "I have a lot of confidence in the vaccines, if you're boosted, in protecting against severe outcomes," Marr says, "and I have a lot of confidence in an N95 and similar types of respirators. And I think that with those 2 things, you can still go about a lot of your normal activities."

[3] Quarantine time

https://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2021-12-21/u-s-mulls-reducing-covid-quarantine-time-amid-omicron-surge


US health authorities are considering reducing the 10-day recommended quarantine period for Americans who test positive for COVID-19 as the omicron variant tears across the country, White House medical adviser Anthony Fauci said on Tuesday [21 Dec 2021].

A spike in COVID-19 cases is alarming public health officials who fear an explosion of infections following social mingling over the Christmas and New Year holidays. Omicron now accounts for 73% of US coronavirus infections, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said Monday [20 Dec 2021].

Breakthrough infections are rising among the fully vaccinated population, including those who have had a 3rd, booster shot. However, omicron appears to be causing milder symptoms in those people, some of whom have no symptoms at all.

Reducing the CDC's 10-day quarantine recommendation would help asymptomatic people return to work or school, with the proper precautions, Fauci told CNN. "That's certainly an important consideration which is being discussed right now," said Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

The measure is being considered particularly in the context of healthcare workers, as the number of COVID cases rises together with the need for healthcare personnel, he said. For those without symptoms, they should put on an N95 mask, "make sure they have the proper PPE and they might be able to get back to work sooner than the full length of the quarantine period," Fauci said.

With omicron being so easily transmissible, the number to watch in this surge is hospitalizations, not overall infections. "If you really want to look at the true impact on society, it's much more important to see who gets sick and who doesn't, who requires hospitalization, or doesn't," he said. "If you just count the numbers of infections, you may get a misrepresentation as to what is actually going on."

https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/2021/12/22/covid-19-bangladesh-records-singe-daily-death-again-352-new-cases


Bangladesh yet again registered one new death from COVID-19 in the last 24 hours to Wednesday [22 Dec 2021] morning. Besides, in the 24-hour period, the country also recorded 352 new cases while seeing 281 patients recover, according to the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS).

The latest additions took the country's death toll to 28 052, the total caseload to 1 581 986 and the total number of recoveries to 1 546 352. A total 18 779 samples were tested at 849 labs across the country during the 24-hour period, yielding a positivity rate of 1.83%.

According to the data, the country's overall COVID-19 mortality rate until Wednesday [22 Dec 2021] morning stood at 1.77%, overall recovery rate at 97.75%, and the overall positivity lowered to 13.97%.

The 7-day moving average of single-day deaths in Bangladesh was 2 on Wednesday [22 Dec 2021]. The only single death in the country was recorded in Dhaka division.

Of the new patients, Dhaka logged 300 cases, the highest among the divisions. No new cases were reported in 32 districts of the country.

Bangladesh reported its first 3 cases of COVID-19, a severe acute respiratory illness caused by a strain of coronavirus later named SARS-CoV-2, on 8 Mar 2020. The 1st death was reported 10 days later.

The country, however, has been witnessing infection rates below or around 2% for the past few weeks. The country last recorded an infection rate of over 3% on 4 Oct 2021 when the figure stood at 3.19%.

A large number of the population has also been vaccinated with the country crossing the landmark of administering 100 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines on 1 Dec 2021, nearly in 10 months after kicking off a nationwide campaign. However, experts have warned against complacency, as many countries are seeing a surge in infections yet again.

Meanwhile, the discovery of a new variant, omicron, has triggered a global alarm. Called B.1.1.529, omicron is the 5th variant of concern designated by the World Health Organization (WHO).

The fast-spreading coronavirus has so far claimed over 5.3 million lives and infected over 276 million people throughout the world, according to Worldometer. More than 248 million people have recovered from the disease, which has affected 223 countries and territories across the planet.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1665195/12-suspected-omicron-cases-found-in-balochistan-health-official


Twelve suspected cases of coronavirus' omicron variant were reported in Balochistan on Tuesday [21 Dec 2021], according to a health official. Head of Operations Cell (COVID) Dr Naqibullah Niazi told Dawn.com that 32 cases had tested positive for COVID-19 out of which 12 cases exhibited signs of the omicron variant. They were from the town of Kalat.

He said their samples were sent to the National Institute of Health in Islamabad, where the presence of the variant would be confirmed after gene sequencing. Dr Niazi said the patients had been quarantined.

Pakistan reported its 1st suspected case of the omicron variant on 8 Dec 2021. Following its gene sequencing, Aga Khan University Hospital confirmed it as the new variant on 13 Dec 2021.

In a statement, the hospital had said the patient was at home and doing well. So far, no other patients at the hospital had been confirmed to have the omicron variant, it had added.

On 18 Dec 2021, health department sources told Dawn that another case of the variant had emerged in a 35-year-old man in Karachi who had arrived from the United Kingdom on 8 Dec 2021. "His genome sequencing report stating that the infection appeared to be of omicron has been sent to the National Institute of Health for further confirmation," an official had said on the condition of anonymity.

Last month [November 2021], Federal Planning Minister Asad Umar and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Health Dr Faisal Sultan had sounded the alarm, saying that the arrival of the omicron variant was inevitable and a matter of time. "This [strain] has to spread in the whole world as we saw before that when a variant comes, the world is so interconnected that it is impossible to stop it," Umar had said, adding that vaccination was the most logical solution to curb the threat.

Pakistan had placed a complete ban on 27 Nov 2021 on travel from 6 southern African countries -- South Africa, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique, Botswana and Namibia -- and Hong Kong in the wake of the variant's discovery. This travel ban was later extended to 9 more countries -- Croatia, Hungary, Netherlands, Ukraine, Ireland, Slovenia, Viet Nam, Poland and Zimbabwe.

Additionally, the National Command and Operating Centre placed 13 countries comprising United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Trinidad and Tobago, Azerbaijan, Mexico, Sri Lanka, Russia, Thailand, France, Austria, Afghanistan and Turkey in category B. All passengers from these countries need to be fully vaccinated, while everyone above the age of 6 must possess a negative PCR test report issued not more than 48 hours before boarding.

Omicron has been classified by the World Health Organisation as a "highly transmissible" variant -- the same category that includes the predominant delta variant.

Three more new cases of omicron COVID variant were reported today [22 Dec 2021] in Sri Lanka, COVID-19 Coordinator, Director of Technical Services of the Ministry of Health, Dr. Anwar Hamdani said. He told Daily Mirror that one out of newly detected patients was a Sri Lankan while the other 2 were foreigners.

"They had arrived in Sri Lanka some time back. However, no contacts were traced and there is no threat due to the new detection," he said.

Meanwhile, Dr. Jude Jayamaha, Consultant Virologist of the Medical Research Institute, told a news briefing today [22 Dec 2021] that 2 of the patients had arrived from Sudan while the other patient is a returnee from Tanzania. Accordingly, the total number of omicron patients identified in Sri Lanka increased to 7 as of today [22 Dec 2021].

The health authorities are of the opinion that omicron cases could increase in future and thus raised the importance of receiving the booster dose without further delay.

The 1st patient carrying the omicron variant of the COVID-19 was identified in Sri Lanka on 3 Dec 2021. The patient was a Sri Lankan citizen who had returned from South Africa on 23 Nov 2021.

The South Asian COVID-19 situation, according to data from Worldometer (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) as of 24 Dec 2021 at 01:24 GMT:
Country: Total cases / Total deaths / Deaths per million population
India: 34 772 657 / 478 863 / 342
Bangladesh: 1 582 368 / 28 054 / 168
Pakistan: 1 292 406 / 28 894 / 127
Nepal: 826 664 / 11 581 / 387
Sri Lanka: 582 149 / 14 832 / 688
Afghanistan: 157 878 / 7346 / 183
Maldives: 94 444 / 261 / 471
Bhutan: 2659 / 3 / 4

Over the last 7 days, 46 608, 1809, 1915, 1488, and 4425 COVID-19 cases were detected in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, respectively, compared with 51 305, 2009, 2125, 1622, and 7052 in the preceding 7 days, revealing the continuation of the decreasing trend of the disease in India, a decreasing trend in Sri Lanka, but a state of almost stability in Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Nepal.

As indicated in items B, D, and E above, more sporadic cases caused by omicron variant (variant B.1.1.529) of the virus are reported or suspected at least from 3 countries in South Asia -- India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka -- and such detection could indicate the probable start of a new surge of the disease across South Asia, as is seen in some other parts of the world. In this context, each country should strictly adhere to common preventive guidelines, such as keeping a physical distance of at least 1 meter [3.3 ft] from others; wearing a well-fitting mask; opening windows to improve ventilation; avoiding poorly ventilated or crowded spaces; keeping hands clean; coughing or sneezing into a bent elbow or tissue; and getting vaccinated.

The daily COVID-19 case positivity in Bangladesh was less than 1.5% for most of the days of the last 4 weeks or so, but the results from 22 and 23 Dec 2021 showed that the rate is now going to touch 2% (http://103.247.238.92/webportal/pages/covid19.php). The daily case positivity in India, however, still remains below 1%.

Preparation in South Asian countries is required to gather and analyze real-time disease data to assess the transmissibility, severity, and probable ability of the variant to evade immunity already developed in the populations through massive vaccination initiatives and also by natural infections.

An update on the omicron variant can be seen at https://www.who.int/news/item/28-11-2021-update-on-omicron.

As of 23 Dec 2021, at 08:00 IST (GMT+5:30) India has administered 1 396 976 774 doses of COVID-19 vaccine (https://www.mohfw.gov.in/).

Bangladesh has a plan for vaccinating 80% of the population above 18 years of age. As of 21 Dec 2021, 50.59% have received the 1st dose and 34.84% of the target population have received both doses (http://103.247.238.92/webportal/pages/covid19-vaccination-update.php).

As of 17 Dec 2021 at 10:49 AM, a total of 145 453 360 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered in Pakistan (https://ncoc.gov.pk/).

So far, Nepal has administered at least 19 157 444 doses of COVID-19 vaccine (https://covid19.who.int/region/searo/country/np), and Sri Lanka has administered at least 32 630 430. Assuming every person needs 2 doses, that number is enough to have vaccinated about 74.8% of the country's population (https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/countries-and-territories/sri-lanka/).
