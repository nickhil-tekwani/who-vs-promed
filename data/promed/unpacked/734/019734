Cholera hit the densely populated Kenya Ward of River Oli division
last week, killing at least one resident of the Municipality on Mon
17 Jul 2006. Two other victims were taken for treatment at Oli Health
Center and have been discharged according to the town Health
Inspector, Ms Norah Fuathum.
The Daily Monitor has learned that the cholera inpatients came from
the same family, while the deceased was their neighbor.
Mr Charles Asiki, the mayor, who recently won the mayoral race on a
pledge to clean up the town and eliminate occurrence of communicable
diseases, said he was embarrassed by the cholera resurgence because
it comes as a result of improper hygiene.
The mayor said the problem started in the premises of a landlord with
19 tenants and over 100 family members, all using a single latrine.

Five days after the district authorities declared Chhani Nagarpalika
as cholera- hit, 18 more people had tested positive for , as scores
of others were treated for gastroenteritis and diarrhea in different
hospitals in the city. Admitting that the number of cholera positive
cases had increased to 27 during the past week, Chief District Health
Officer (CDHO) Dr Bhagwat Etare said 5 more people were admitted to
the hospital with similar symptoms yesterday, 18 Jul 2006. The fluid
samples were collected for testing.
Although there was no report of any casualty due to the outbreak of
cholera, the disease had spread panic in Chhani and its neighboring
villages, as hundreds of people, including women and children, had
reportedly suffered from water-borne diseases during the last fortnight.
Sources in the CDHO office said about 90 patients were still admitted
to Chhani PHC, SSG and other hospitals in the city.
