In Himachal, more than 13 patients have died of scrub typhus.

An awareness campaign is on, and doctors are on high alert. This time,
more people died due to a prolonged spell of the rainy season.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Bharti for his report on scrub typhus in
Himachal Pradesh.

ProMED-mail posted a report of a large outbreak of scrub typhus in
Himachal Pradesh in March 2011; there were more than 200 cases,
although none were fatal at the time (see Scrub typhus - India: (HP) 20110319.0872).

Himachal Pradesh is a state in northwestern India that is bordered by
the Indian states of Jammu and Kashmir on the north, Punjab on the
west and southwest, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh on the south,
Uttarakhand on the southeast, and by the Tibet Autonomous Region on
the east (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himachal_Pradesh).

Himachal Pradesh is a mountainous state with an elevation ranging from
about 350 meters (1148 ft) to 7000 meters (22 966 ft) above sea level
and has one of the highest per capita incomes of any state in India.
