A white-tailed deer has tested positive for rabies. The [Pennsylvania] Department of Health says the deer was found in Empire Court Trailer Park in Centre Hall [Centre County].

The department urges anyone who may have been bitten or exposed to saliva, fluids, or tissue from the deer to call Centre County State Health Center.

Anyone with a pet that may have come in contact with the rabid deer should contact a veterinarian.

Exposure includes having been bitten, scratched, or had saliva, nervous system fluid, or tissue from an animal enter a person's open wound or mucous membranes such as eyes, nose, or mouth. Under these circumstances, individuals should seek immediate medical attention.

The department also reminds all residents that they should avoid contact with feral animals of any kind as it can be difficult to tell whether or not the animal is rabid.

All animals that can be vaccinated -- cats, dogs, and ferrets -- should be given the vaccine to protect them in case they are ever exposed to a rabid animal.

[There have been several previous reports of rabid deer in USA (more than 100 since 1990). From 2007 to 2010 there were 11 confirmed cases in 4 deer farms in Pennsylvania (see http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/1/pdfs/11-1189.pdf).

The rabies virus most likely was transmitted to the deer through contact with reservoir wildlife.

The state of Pennsylvania can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=2682317,19442. Centre County can be seen on the map at http://geology.com/county-map/pennsylvania-county-map.gif. - Mod.PMB]
