INFLUENZA - AUSTRALIA (3)
=========================
[Regarding Karl Johnson and Richard Doherty's comments on Influenza in
Australia]
National Influenza Surveillance is coordinated by the Department of Human
Services and Health in Canberra, Australia. Throughout the winter months data
are collated from a number of different sources and published fortnightly in
Communicable Diseases Intelligence.
In 1995 influenza A reports peaked in June, slightly earlier than usual. The
majority of isolates were identified as being H1N1 subtypes. A subsequent
rise in influenza B reports was seen in August.
During summer influenza activity monitoring continues through the laboratory
reporting scheme. As expected for the time of year few isolates have been
reported in recent months.
In reply to Richard Doherty's question - we are regular PROMED readers.
