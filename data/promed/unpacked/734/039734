Scientist begins to unravel what makes pandemic H1N1 tick
---------------------------------------------------------
As the number of deaths related to the pandemic H1N1 virus, commonly
known as "swine flu," continues to rise, researchers have been
scrambling to decipher its inner workings and explain why the
incidence is lower than expected in older adults. In a study appearing
online and in a future issue of Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences [see comment below], a UT [University of Texas] Southwestern
Medical Center researcher and his collaborators in California show
that the molecular makeup of the current H1N1 flu strain is strikingly
different from previous H1N1 strains as well as the normal seasonal
flu, especially in structural parts of the virus normally recognized
by the immune system.

Prior research has shown that an individual's immune system is
triggered to fight off pathogens such as influenza when specific
components of the immune system -- namely antibodies, B-cells, and T
cells -- recognize parts of a virus known as epitopes. An individual's
ability to recognize those epitopes -- spurred by past infections or
vaccinations -- helps prevent future infections. The challenge is that
these epitopes vary among flu strains. "We hypothesize that older
people are somewhat protected because the epitopes present in flu
strains before 1957 may be similar to those found in the current H1N1
strain, or at least similar enough that the immune system of the
previously infected person recognizes the pathogen and knows to
attack," said Dr Richard Scheuermann, professor of pathology and
clinical sciences at UT Southwestern and a co-author of the paper.
"Those born more recently have virtually no pre-existing immunity to
this pandemic H1N1 strain because they have never been exposed to
anything like it."

Between April and mid-October [2009], the current H1N1 virus sickened
roughly 22 million Americans and contributed to or caused about 4000
deaths, according to the figures recently released by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]. The deaths included 540
children. The CDC report also estimates the total number of
hospitalizations at around 98 000 nationwide, with children accounting
for 36 000 of the total.

For this study, researchers examined whether epitopes present in the
seasonal flu strains between 1988 and 2008 also are found in the
existing H1N1 strain. They used data catalogued in the Immune Epitope
Database as well as information from the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and the Global Initiative on Sharing
Avian Influenza Data's (GISAID) influenza genetic sequence databases.
Dr Scheuermann said his team also analyzed the virus genetic data
using the NIH-sponsored Influenza Research Database
(<http://www.fludb.org>), which he oversees at UT Southwestern. The
researchers found major genetic differences between the pandemic H1N1
strain and seasonal strains, potentially explaining why children and
young adults are more susceptible to the H1N1 strain now circulating
worldwide.

"Normally, older adults are generally more susceptible to pathogens
like influenza, however, for the pandemic H1N1 strain this does not
seem to be the case," said Dr Scheuermann, who is also a member of the
Cancer Immunobiology Center at UT Southwestern. "The antibody
epitopes, which provide protection against disease, for the pandemic
H1N1 strain are virtually all different from those present in recent
seasonal strains, so young people have no built-in protective
mechanisms. We speculate that older adults may have been exposed to
viruses in their youth in which the epitopes are more similar."

At this point, he said, scientists must continue to be vigilant about
tracking the pandemic H1N1 strain as it continues to evolve. "H1N1 has
not mutated in such a way as to make people sicker, but it could
happen," Dr Scheuermann said. "It is important that individuals follow
the public health guidelines regarding vaccination as the H1N1 vaccine
becomes more widely available."

[The report above is based on an open access paper published online in
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA entitled:
"Pre-existing immunity against swine-origin H1N1 influenza viruses in
the general human population" by Jason A Greenbaum and 10 others at
the Division of Vaccine Discovery, La Jolla Institute for Allergy and
Immunology, La Jolla, CA 92037; San Diego Supercomputer Center,
University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093; and
Department of Pathology and Division of Biomedical Informatics,
University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390;
available at
<http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/11/13/0911580106.full.pdf+html>.

The abstract reads: "A major concern about the ongoing swine-origin
H1N1 influenza virus (S-OIV) outbreak is that the virus may be so
different from seasonal H1N1 that little immune protection exists in
the human population. In this study, we examined the molecular basis
for pre-existing immunity against S-OIV, namely the recognition of
viral immune epitopes by T cells or B cells/antibodies that have been
previously primed by circulating influenza strains. Using data from
the Immune Epitope Database, we found that only 31 percent (8/26) of
B-cell epitopes present in recently circulating H1N1 strains are
conserved in the S-OIV, with only 17 percent (1/6) conserved in the
hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) surface proteins. In
contrast, 69 percent (54/78) of the epitopes recognized by CD8+ T
cells are completely invariant. We further demonstrate experimentally
that some memory T-cell immunity against S-OIV is present in the adult
population and that such memory is of similar magnitude as the
pre-existing memory against seasonal H1N1 influenza. Because
protection from infection is antibody mediated, a new vaccine based on
the specific S-OIV HA and NA proteins is likely to be required to
prevent infection. However, T cells are known to blunt disease
severity. Therefore, the conservation of a large fraction of T-cell
epitopes suggests that the severity of an S-OIV infection, as far as
it is determined by susceptibility of the virus to immune attack,
would not differ much from that of seasonal flu. These results are
consistent with reports about disease incidence, severity, and
mortality rates associated with human S-OIV."

These findings provide an immunological basis for the observation that
the incidence and severity of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection in
older people are less than expected in relation to the overall impact
of the pandemic. The epitope analysis undertaken by Professor
Scheuermann and collaborators has revealed that some memory T-cell
immunity against the 2009 (H1N1) pandemic virus is present in the
adult population, which may reduce the severity of illness but not
prevent infection. Nonetheless older people should continue to follow
public health guidelines recommending vaccination as a protection
against possible change in virulence of the pandemic virus. - Mod.CP]
