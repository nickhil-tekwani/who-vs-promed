[We] would appreciate any information that other student health centers
have regarding this. We believe that one of our sororities was affected and
have been in contact with the Illinois Department of Public Health and have
been contacted by the Centers for Disease Control [and Prevention].

Investigation of Respiratory Illness Among College "Spring Break" Visitors
to Acapulco, Mexico
----------------------------------------------------------
Update: 2 April 2001
The Pennsylvania Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention are beginning an investigation of clusters of acute
respiratory illness among students who traveled to Acapulco, Mexico for
"Spring Break" in early March [2001]. Based on clinical findings and chest
radiographs, we suspect a fungal infection such as histoplasmosis or
coccidioidomycosis. Laboratory confirmation is pending.
At this time, we are aware of illness in student travelers from 2
Pennsylvania colleges in different areas of our state. Both groups stayed
at the same hotel in Acapulco, Mexico during approximately the first week
of March. (Of note, the hotel is said to have had "major construction" at
the time of their visit. Also, there is a report of an earthquake in the
region at the time of the trips. The significance of the earthquake to this
investigation is not yet clear.) We have also heard rumors of illness among
students from a different campus in another state but this has not yet been
confirmed.
The total number of ill college students in Pennsylvania is not clear, but
at this time as many as 16 from one campus and 11 from another campus have
been reported to have suffered some fever and/or respiratory symptoms. The
students' illnesses mostly began during the last week of March [2001] and
generally include fever, dry cough, and substernal non-pleuritic chest
pain, with chest radiographs showing infiltrates consistent with a fungal
infection. Students initially treated with antibacterials such as
azithromycin showed no improvement, and some are now on oral antifungal
therapy (it is too early to tell if they are improving). Several were
briefly hospitalized but none are life-threateningly ill; others had less
severe symptoms and were treated on an outpatient basis.
If you become aware of other ill visitors to Acapulco, please let your
local or state public health authorities know, and we would appreciate it
if you would also let us know at the numbers below.

Investigation of Respiratory Illness Among College "Spring Break" Visitors
to Acapulco, Mexico
----------------------------------------------------------
Update 5 April 2001
Suspect cases are now being reported from multiple states, involving
similar symptoms with varying degrees of morbidity. The investigation by
CDC and now several state and local health departments continues. Please
contact your local or state health department to report ill travelers to
Acapulco. They will soon be able to work with you to complete a
standardized report form so that we collect the same information from all
the involved persons across the country.
At least one press report has appeared which incorrectly asserts that
histoplasmosis has been established as the cause of this outbreak
(Philadelphia Inquirer, 5 Apr 2001). _Histoplasma [capsulatum_] is
certainly on the list of possible etiologies, but at this time we do NOT
know what the actual etiology is in any patient. Other possibilities to
consider include other fungi such as _Coccidioides [immitis_], and various
other "atypical" causes of pneumonia such as _Legionella_, _Mycoplasma_, or
Adenovirus. In at least one cluster of ill college travelers, tests for
_Legionella_ antibodies and urine antigen were negative [Serum antibody to
_Legionella pneumophila_ detects antibodies to _L. pneumophila_ serogroups
1-4. This test will not detect infection with other _Legionella_ species
and may be negative during the acute infection. A convalescent sample
should be sent 2 to 3 weeks after the initial specimen to look for a rise
in titer. The _Legionella_ urinary antigen test is a rapid assay for the
detection of _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1 antigen in urine samples.
The test is particularly useful in the early stages of disease allowing for
the diagnosis during the acute phase. This test will not detect infection
with _L. pneumophila_ serogroups other than 1 or with other _Legionella_
species. - Man. Ed. DS]. In some instances, symptoms have lingered despite
therapy with azithromycin or quinolone antimicrobials. There is also a
report of a patient who did not improve after therapy with an oral
antifungal agent.
We are particularly interested in hearing about negative and positive
diagnostic tests, including especially from the more severely ill or
hospitalized patients. CDC will be coordinating outbreak laboratory studies
with your state health department. Please contact your health department if
you can provide serum, nasopharyngeal swabs, or tissue samples (such as
from transbronchial biopsy) from ill travelers.
