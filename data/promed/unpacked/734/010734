In the past 2 months, 64 cases of measles virus infection have been recorded. During this period, previously unrecognised susceptibility to measles virus infection was detected in the Roma population of the Volga and Volodarskay districts, and in [the city of] Astrachan, 26 medical students contracted the disease.

So far 15 people -- 8 children and 7 adults -- have required hospital in-patient treatment. According to the Regional Health Ministry, their condition is not giving cause for concern. At the request of the infectious diseases authorities of the Astrachan Region Ministry of Health, all necessary measures are being implemented to terminate the spread of the infection. Three days after the detection of the 1st cases of measles in the Volga Region, a total of 2200 people were examined and vaccinated.

It will be recalled that in September 2013, 26 students at the Astrakhan State Medical Academy contracted the disease. The outbreak virus had been introduced by a single student from Dagestan. Immediate steps were implemented to contain the outbreak at the Medical Academy by vaccination of students and staff.

[The fact that so many of the students at the Astrachan Medical Academy contracted measles from a single student originating from an adjacent republic suggests that vaccination coverage in the Astrachan Oblast is not as comprehensive as believed by the local medical authorities.

The declining trend in the number of laboratory confirmed cases of measles in England continued for a 5th successive month into September 2013, with only 13 new cases reported in that month.

The total number of cases for the year [2013] is 1385, unchanged from the total published to the end of August 2013. This is due to the exclusion of some cases initially classified as reactive but now reclassified. As in August 2013, the South-West region reported the most cases in September 2013, and almost all of these were associated with an on-going outbreak of a new D8 strain in the area. A few sporadic cases were detected in other regions.

So far this year [2013], 271 (20 percent) confirmed cases have been associated with primary and secondary school outbreaks. Small outbreaks have also been reported from "hard-to-reach" populations with known low vaccine coverage such as the travelling community and the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community in north London. Overall, 295 (21 percent) of all cases in 2013 were admitted to hospital; 47 reported complications including pneumonia, meningitis and gastroenteritis.

The latest outbreak comes less than 4 months after Wales' biggest measles outbreak. Public Health Wales (PHW) renewed its call for parents to urgently get their children vaccinated to stop the disease from spreading. PHW said it was "very frustrated" with cases reaching 36 since early October 2013. The latest outbreak comes less than 4 months after Wales' biggest measles outbreak ended, centred on the same area with 1200 suspected cases.

The outbreak has affected 4 schools in the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board (ABM) area. "Parents and young people should not underestimate how serious measles can be and how quickly it can spread," said Dr Jorg Hoffmann, consultant in communicable disease control for PHW. "In a school setting, one child with measles sitting in a classroom for just one hour will lead to at least 70 per cent of other pupils who are not vaccinated catching measles. PHW is working closely with ABM to bring the outbreak under control, and where a sufficient number of children are unvaccinated in a school where there have been measles cases, school vaccination sessions will be arranged.

The Swansea area epidemic lasted 8 months with suspected cases 1st reported in November 2012. By the time the outbreak was declared over in July 2013, it had resulted in 1219 notifications of measles cases in the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg, Hywel Dda and Powys health board areas. Some 88 people visited a hospital due to measles during the outbreak, and more than 75 000 were vaccinated throughout Wales. A 25-year-old male from Swansea died from pneumonia after contracting the virus at the height of the epidemic.

Although more than 70 000 catch up doses of MMR were given across Wales during the outbreak, around 30 000 children and young people in the 10 to 18 age group remain unprotected. Dr Hoffmann added: "We are very frustrated to see more cases of measles in the area so soon after the large outbreak earlier this year [2013], and we are very keen for this to be stopped before it can get any bigger and we return to a position where children are admitted to hospital or die or are damaged by the disease. The only way to achieve that is through vaccination, and I urge parents whose children have not received 2 doses of MMR to ensure that they speak to their GP immediately to arrange this quick, safe and effective vaccine."

A measles outbreak was reported on Mon 4 Nov 2013 by the Ukrainian Ministry of Health. A total of 42 children have been affected. Between 23-28 Oct 2013, a total of 42 children contracted measles, according to the statement.

As of Monday [4 Nov 2013], all patients with a mild form of the disease are in out-patient treatment. The General Directorate of the GosSanEpidemNadzor in the Rovenskoia Oblast created a rapid response team to investigate the causes of the disease. The epidemiological investigation established that 9 individuals had been fully vaccinated according to the recommendations of the national immunization schedule; 4 had received a single vaccination only, and the remaining 29 had not been vaccinated. Where appropriate, revaccination is being undertaken.

Measles outbreak response in Africa needs to focus on the youngest children, who are most affected, according to a report by Medecins Sans Frontieres on a resurgence of the disease in sub-Saharan Africa, published yesterday [5 Nov 2013] in PLoS Medicine. The group compared and contrasted 2 measles outbreaks that accounted for most measles cases in the region in recent years. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 128 111 measles cases occurred in 2010 and 2011, including 1454 deaths. 60 percent of those cases occurred in Katanga province, which saw an attack rate (AR) of 0.71 percent and a case-fatality rate (CFR) of 1.40 percent.

That contrasts with Malawi, which had 134 039 measles cases in 2010 but only 304 deaths. That country's AR was 0.96 percent, but its CFR was only 0.23 percent.

Age differences between the 2 outbreaks were dramatic. In Katanga, the median age of patients was 2 years, with 80 percent of reported case-patients 5 years old or younger and only 6 percent 10 years or older. In Malawi, the median age of patients was 7 years, with 41 percent of reported cases in children 5 years old or younger and 28 percent 15 years or older.

"Differences in measles epidemiology and country-specific control goals necessitate more than a one-size-fits-all strategy," the authors summarized. "The youngest children -- who account for the most deaths and complications -- should be prioritized by the outbreak response."

[From Measles Outbreak Response Immunization Is Context-Specific: Insight from the Recent Experience of Medecins Sans Frontieres http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.1001544: The authors conclude that: "In both settings, the highest ARs occurred among infants 6-8 months old, too young to be vaccinated by routine programs. The benefit of vaccinating earlier in regions with high birth rates, as in Katanga, has been previously discussed [20]. In Malawi, young infants aged 0-5 months were highly affected, with an AR higher than that of children 12 months and older. Recent studies showed lower concentrations and earlier loss of maternal antibodies against measles in infants of vaccinated women than in infants of naturally immune women [21]. In countries with effective measles vaccination programs, maternal antibody levels against measles may, therefore, be low. In such contexts, early vaccination of infants should be considered in the case of an outbreak, as described elsewhere [22].

In both settings, ARs were higher for young children born after the last SIA. Among these children, the proportion receiving their 1st or 2nd dose during the MSF reactive campaign was high, suggesting that non-selective strategies are efficient for poorly vaccinated age groups or those that have not been offered their 2nd immunization opportunity. Nonetheless, the high proportion of older individuals reporting having received more than 2 doses suggests that non-selective vaccination might not be the most cost-effective option for highly vaccinated populations. In such contexts, cost-benefit studies are urgently needed to evaluate the differential benefit in terms of disease prevention and mortality reduction [23] of continuing with non-selective strategies to deliver the 2nd dose, whether in SIAs or ORI campaigns.

As measles control improves across sub-Saharan Africa, outbreak response vaccination should also keep pace with these improvements. Countries should set their own priorities for outbreak response, targeted to their measles control goals. Immunization strategies should be tailored to local measles epidemiology, following early assessment. In particular, the age distribution of early cases should guide the decisions concerning which age groups to target in priority. Measles vaccination is an essential component of outbreak response in settings where the main objective is mortality reduction. In those contexts, the youngest children -- accounting for the most deaths and complications -- should be prioritised." - Mod.CP

The Ministry of Health, through the Department of Epidemiology has reported the occurrence of a measles outbreak in Brazil involving the States of Pernambuco, Sao Paulo, Minas Gerais, Santa Catarina, Paraiba and Distrito Federal. The Provincial Health Portfolio advised that those who are traveling to neighbouring administrations should obtain rubella and measles immunisation before travelling to and entering border areas (i.e. Puerto Iguazu, San Antonio, Bernardo de Irigoyen, San Pedro, The Proud, Alba Posse and San Javier).

It also recommended that people should in any case verify their vaccination status in relation to their age and the national requirements: i.e. children 13 months to 5 years must have received one dose of MMR [measles, mumps and rubella] vaccine, and persons aged 6-50 years should have received at least have 2 doses of a vaccine containing at least 2 of the 3 MMWR components (measles and rubella), and have documentary evidence to confirm their status, or alternatively accredited serology (IgG) for rubella and measles. People over 50 are considered to be immune (as a consequence of previous exposure to the infection prior to the availability of vaccine).

When there is doubt about vaccination status, it is recommended that people obtain vaccination at least 10 days before travelling.

[According to the Pan-American Health Organisation (PAHO), globally, measles remains a leading cause of death in young children, claiming an estimated 380 lives every day, or 15 every hour (WHO data, 2010). In 2002, the Americas became the 1st WHO region to interrupt endemic measles transmission. Between 2003 and 2010, annual notified measles cases averaged 156 per year, virtually all imported or related to importations. In 2011, the number of measles cases in the region jumped to 1324, due to importation of viruses from several large outbreaks occurring in Europe and Africa. 93 percent of all cases in the Americas in 2011 were reported from 3 countries: Canada, Ecuador and the United States http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_view&gid=19670&Itemid=.

The 1st case of measles in Brazil in the past 10 years was recorded on 21 Jan this year [2013]. Since then, a total of 114 cases of measles have been confirmed, 98 of them in Pernambuco, 7 in Paraiba, 5 in Sao Paulo, 2 in Mato Grosso, one in Santa Catarina, and one in the Federal District. Travellers to Brazil must ensure that they have been adequately immunised with the mumps-measles-rubella [MMR] vaccine. Immunity is assumed for those born before 1966, but for all others, a clear history of the disease, evidence of 2 vaccinations with MMR or a positive blood test are advisable, but, if in doubt, a single MMR vaccination a fortnight prior to travel should provide sufficient protection (From: http://www.traveldoctor.com.au/Article/Alerts/South-America/Measles-in-Brazil. - Mod.CP

Medical health officers in Lethbridge say they are bracing for a larger measles outbreak. The number of measles cases in the Lethbridge area has now climbed to 18, provincial officials confirmed Monday [4 Nov 2013]. Cases in the southern Alberta city have been steadily rising since the outbreak was 1st reported last month [October 2013]. Alberta Health Services officer Dr. Richard Musto expects the number to climb even higher. "Where we have populations that are under-immunized, this virus is very, very infectious and spreads easily. So, I expect we may see some more cases. The fact that we're at 18 is not a great surprise."

Musto says additional immunization clinics are being offered in the south zone, which covers much of southern Alberta. Immunizations are not mandatory in the province, but he says teams on the ground have been working hard to limit the spread of the disease, adding that other Alberta Health Services zones are looking at what vaccinations they might need to do. "It's an opportunity for us to review our own coverage rates for measles vaccine and see if there are any populations that are particularly under-vaccinated. Of course, we're in preparation mode, but, at the moment, there have been no reported cases outside of the south zone," said Musto.

The original case has been traced back to a traveller from the Lethbridge area who recently returned from Holland, site of a measles outbreak.

Saskatchewan's 1st suspected case of measles is not being linked to an outbreak in southern Alberta, but that has not left Saskatchewan health officials breathing any easier. With Regina preparing for several high-profile events, including the 101st Grey Cup game, Saqib Shahab, the province's chief medical officer, acknowledged "a suspected" case of measles had been reported with "some history of travel to southern Alberta." But Dr. Shahab was quick to add: "This case is not currently considered linked to the Alberta outbreak. The symptoms were mild, and the patient is fully recovered. ... Even so, we still have to raise awareness."

Given how far and how quickly the contagious disease can spread, Saskatchewan went on alert not long after Alberta Health Services reported its 1st case in late October, a Grade 9 student at the Coaldale Christian School. Southern Alberta has low immunization rates, and so far, 20 cases have been confirmed in the Lethbridge area.

Saskatchewan health officials took to reminding people that measles has not been eradicated and that vaccinations and booster shots are a necessary defence. "We are fairly close in proximity [to southern Alberta], and there are lots of cultural ties, family ties and business reasons for people to go back and forth," said Dr. Shahab, who is based in Regina. "The last 3 years, we've been increasingly aware of measles. Last year [2012], we had 2 cases in Regina in the spring and 4 cases in the fall. In Saskatoon and Prince Albert, we had 2 cases. So in recent years, we had 8 cases, and we did a lot to boost immunization rates."

Saskatchewan's immunization rate is 92 per cent for 2 doses of the measles vaccine. In Alberta, the rate sits at 85 per cent, well off the stated goal of 98 per cent to achieve what is known as herd immunity. Immunization is not mandatory in either province, yet both set up vaccination clinics and assessment centres. In Regina, staying measles free is about to become a necessity.

A new report shows an increase in the rates of certain infectious diseases in Michigan, including a case of measles in Calhoun County. The Michigan Department of Community Health issues a weekly report of the Michigan Disease Surveillance System. For the 2 Nov 2013 report, one case of measles was reported for Calhoun County. Health Officer Jim Rutherford of the Calhoun County Public Health Department said it was the 1st he's seen here in more than 5 years.

The measles case, an 8-month-old child, contracted the disease while in Pakistan earlier this year [2013]. The health department then suspected measles, but final testing was yet to come, officials said in May 2013. The MDCH report has confirmed it. The health department followed up by finding out who came into contact with the child in this area and worked with officials in Kalamazoo County as well.

Measles is a highly contagious respiratory virus. People of any age can get it, although the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine is effective against it. Children between 6 months and one year old can get the vaccine, Rutherford said. The MMR vaccine is required for school attendance in Michigan. The disease can be mild in children but dangerous to pregnant women; congenital rubella syndrome affects the fetus and can lead to health problems later in life.

The Calhoun case is one of 5 in the state so far this year [2013]. Three cases were in Midland County, and another one happened in Kent County. None were reported statewide in 2009 or 2010, 2 in 2011, and one in 2012.

The latest [measles] case is a 36-year-old woman but is not linked to the 6 children aged 7-14 reported yesterday [6 Nov 2013] who caught the disease while holidaying in Bali. South Australia [SA] Health has issued another public health alert after confirmation that the woman has the highly infectious disease. SA Health Chief Medical Officer, Professor Paddy Phillips said the woman is in a stable condition in hospital.

"While measles is not very common in Australia anymore, it is still widespread in other parts of the world, such as South East Asia and Europe," Professor Phillips said. "This case of measles was acquired in Bali, which is a very popular holiday destination at this time of year for schoolies and summer holidays. "If you are considering travelling overseas, it is important to remember to make sure all your vaccinations are up to date."

SA Health has contacted a number of other people known to have been exposed to the cases during the infectious period. "We are advising everyone, especially people who were in the locations mentioned during these times, to be alert for symptoms," Professor Phillips said. "The illness begins with fever, cough, runny nose, and sore eyes, followed by a rash which begins on the head and then spreads down the body. Complications of measles can be severe.

An alert has been issued to General Practitioners advising them of this case.

This is the 10th case of measles reported in South Australia during 2013, compared to 3 cases at this time last year [2012]. A total of 6 cases were recorded in 2012.

Contact points with the children who fell ill include the Adelaide Hills Farmers Market at Mt Barker on 12 Oct 2013, the Morphettville Medical Centre at Glenelg East on 13 Oct 2013, Kirinari Community School at Unley on 15-16 Oct 2013, and the Plympton Family Practice on 16 Oct 2013.

35 people have now contracted measles in Queensland in one of the worst outbreaks of the disease in Queensland's recent history. This year [2013], 30 of the 35 measles cases have emerged since August 2013, with 8 cases now confirmed at Woodford Correctional Centre. Last year [2012], only 4 Queenslanders contracted measles.

Questions are being asked whether the measles outbreak is linked to overcrowding in Queensland prisons. The Department of Justice and Attorney General on Wed 6 Nov 2013 evening confirmed there were now 6432 prisoners in Queensland jails. It is the 1st time in Queensland history that prisoner numbers have been more than 6000. The extra 832 prisoners include hundreds "doubling up" in cells at several prisons in the Ipswich area. Queensland's chief medical officer Dr Jeanette Young confirmed that "gene tracing" had matched the Woodford prison measles outbreak to the measles outbreak in Ipswich, which so far has affected 23 people including those at Woodford," Dr Young said on Thursday [7 Nov 2013] night.

"So far this year [2013], 35 people in Queensland have contracted measles, with 30 of these falling ill since August 2013, including the 23 in the Ipswich-Woodford outbreak." There has not been a connection to an Ipswich prison, although prisoner transfers are being checked, Dr Young told reporters last week. Dr Young confirmed the 3 extra cases of measles -- bringing the total to 8 confirmed cases -- inside Woodford Correctional Centre. Dr Young confirmed prisons were now a hotspot of concern for health authorities, after vaccinating 1200 prisoners and staff.

Dr Young said that as of 5 Nov 2013, 8 people -- 6 prisoners and 2 prison staff -- had contracted measles in the Woodford prison outbreak. That includes a 23-year-old male, a 41-year-old female, a 35-year-old male, a 36-year-old male, a 37-year-old male, a 20-year-old male, a 27-year-old male and a 24-year-old female. "This immunisation campaign saw all but one prisoner vaccinated," she said. "That particular prisoner is being kept isolated to remove the risk of contracting the disease."

A Corrective Services spokesman on Wednesday [6 Nov 2013] said no Woodford prisoner who had contracted measles had been sharing a cell. "Health considerations are taken into account when assessing prisoners for double-up placement," the spokesman said. "No prisoner at Woodford Correctional Centre who has contracted measles to date has been in double-up accommodation with another prisoner."

Health authorities have already warned that people between the ages of 20 and 40 are more vulnerable to measles because they believed they were immunised. Public health physician Dr Heidi Carroll said many adults in their late 20s and early 30s mistakenly believe they have been vaccinated for measles. "This may be because measles vaccine wasn't universally available to all children in Australia until the late 1980s and early 1990s," she said.

Most prisoners in Queensland prisons are aged between 20 and 40.
