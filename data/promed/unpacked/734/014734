It wasn't long into the pandemic before Simon Carley realized we had an evidence problem. It was early 2020, and COVID-19 infections were starting to lap at the shores of the United Kingdom, where Carley is an emergency-medicine doctor at hospitals in Manchester. Carley is also a specialist in evidence-based medicine -- the transformative idea that physicians should decide how to treat people by referring to rigorous evidence, such as clinical trials.

As cases of COVID-19 climbed in February [2020], Carley thought that clinicians were suddenly abandoning evidence and reaching for drugs just because they sounded biologically plausible. Early studies Carley saw being published often lacked control groups or enrolled too few people to draw firm conclusions. "We were starting to treat patients with these drugs initially just on what seemed like a good idea," he says. He understood the desire to do whatever is possible for someone gravely ill, but he also knew how dangerous it is to assume a drug works when so many promising treatments prove to be ineffective -- or even harmful -- in trials. "The COVID-19 pandemic has arguably been one of the greatest challenges to evidence-based medicine since the term was coined in the last century," Carley and his colleagues wrote of the problems they were seeing (1 [see source URL for complete references]).

Other medical experts echo these concerns. With the pandemic now deep into its 2nd year, it's clear the crisis has exposed major weaknesses in the production and use of research-based evidence -- failures that have inevitably cost lives. Researchers have registered more than 2900 clinical trials related to COVID-19, but the majority are too small or poorly designed to be of much use [see "Small Samples" figure at the source URL]. Organizations worldwide have scrambled to synthesize the available evidence on drugs, masks and other key issues, but can't keep up with the outpouring of new research, and often repeat others' work. There's been "research waste at an unprecedented scale," says Huseyin Naci, who studies health policy at the London School of Economics.

At the same time, shining examples of good practice have emerged: Medical advances based on rigorous evidence have helped to chart a route out of the pandemic. The rapid trials of vaccines were spectacular successes, and well-run trials of possible treatments have shown, for instance, that some steroids help to fight COVID-19, but the drug hydroxychloroquine doesn't. Many physicians point to the United Kingdom's RECOVERY trial as exemplary in showing how quick action and simple protocols make it possible to conduct a large clinical trial in a crisis. And researchers have launched "living" systematic reviews that are constantly updated as research emerges -- essential in a fast-moving disease outbreak.

As the COVID-19 response turns from a sprint to a marathon, researchers are taking stock and looking ahead. In October [2021], global-health leaders will meet for 3 days to discuss what's been learnt from COVID-19 about supplying evidence in health emergencies. COVID-19 is a stress test that revealed the flaws in systems that produce evidence, says Elie Akl, an internal-medicine specialist and clinical epidemiologist at the American University of Beirut. "It would be shameful if we come out of this experience and not make the necessary change for the next crisis."

["Evidence-based medicine, whose philosophical origins extend back to mid-19th century Paris and earlier, is the conscientious, explicit and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients. The practice of evidence-based medicine means integrating individual clinical expertise with the best available external clinical evidence from systematic research. By individual clinical expertise we mean the proficiency and judgment that we individual clinicians acquire through clinical experience and clinical practice. Increased expertise is reflected in many ways, but especially in more effective and efficient diagnosis and in the more thoughtful identification and compassionate use of individual patients' predicaments, rights, and preferences in making clinical decisions about their care. By best available external clinical evidence we mean clinically relevant research, often from the basic sciences of medicine, but especially from patient centered clinical research into the accuracy and precision of diagnostic tests (including the clinical examination), the power of prognostic markers, and the efficacy and safety of therapeutic, rehabilitative, and preventive regimens.... The practice of evidence-based medicine is a process of life-long, self-directed learning in which caring for our own patients creates the need for clinically important information about diagnosis, prognosis, therapy, and other clinical and health care issues, and in which we (1) convert these information needs into answerable questions; (2) track down, with maximum efficiency, the best evidence with which to answer them (whether from the clinical examination, the diagnostic laboratory from research evidence, or other sources); (3) critically appraise that evidence for its validity (closeness to the truth) and usefulness ([clinical] applicability); (4) integrate this appraisal with our clinical expertise and apply it in practice; and (5) evaluate our performance" (from Sackett DL. Evidence-based medicine. Semin Perinatol. 1997; 21(1): 3-5. https://doi.org/10.1016/S0146-0005(97)80013-4).

The Nature article on COVID and evidence-based medicine is a good article to read in full, in preparation for the next pandemic to challenge us. - Mod.LK]

[2] UK: B.1.617.2 variant spreading
Date: Fri 21 May 2021

https://amp.economist.com/britain/2021/05/22/a-covid-variant-is-spreading-in-britain-but-this-time-is-different


Bolton's vaccine bus plies the town's southern neighbourhoods. On social media the doctors who run it advertise the fact that there is "Pfizer on the bus!" That vaccine is more popular locally than one made by AstraZeneca, which has been dogged by reports of extremely rare blood clots. Queues form as the bus rolls up to car parks outside mosques, schools and community centres.

A new variant of coronavirus was detected in India last year [2020] and arrived in Britain this spring [2021]. Cases have grown quickly in recent weeks, particularly in Bolton. The viral geneticists call it B.1.617.2. The media call it the "Indian variant." The government's scientific advisers believe that 617.2 is more infectious than the "Kent variant," B.1.1.7, which drove Britain's deadly 2nd wave through January [2021]. Indeed, 617.2 has started to outcompete 1.1.7 [see chart at source URL found above].

It is doing so in a very different environment. Most Britons have received a 1st dose of coronavirus vaccine. Twenty million, most of them old or otherwise highly vulnerable, have had 2. Any infection a vaccinated person does get is likely to be milder, meaning they are less likely to distribute the virus. So 617.2 will spread in a different manner to 1.1.7.

The majority of new cases being found in Britain are in teenagers. In the 7-day period to 13 May 2021, just 4 people per 100 000 aged between 85 and 89 tested positive in England. The equivalent number for 10- to 14-year-olds was 46. Even though cases of 617.2 are growing proportionally, cases of coronavirus overall are flat. So are measures of hospitalisation and death. Whereas last week saw cases surge in Bolton and other places with clusters of infection, growth rates slowed through the beginning of this week and even declined in some areas.

The health service will struggle to deal with another COVID-19 surge even if it comes with a lower rate of serious illness and death. Waiting lists for other conditions have grown long and staff morale is low. A surge would also pose risks to children's education. Some schools in Bolton have already moved entire year groups back to online classes.

If the number of cases climbs, the government will face pressure to delay the relaxation of restrictions, and perhaps to implement local lockdowns. In the meantime, Bolton's vaccine bus has the right idea. It is focusing on getting jabs to areas of the city like Deane, Rumsworth and Great Lever. Data on vaccinations from Public Health England shows that those areas have far lower vaccine coverage than the average for Bolton or Britain. As of 9 May 2021 only 42% of people in Rumsworth aged 16 or older had taken a 1st dose of vaccine. The average across Britain is almost 70%. On 15 May 2021, Lynn Donkin, Bolton's assistant director of public health, told the Bolton Hindu Forum that new cases are concentrated in those areas too.

Some blame vaccine hesitancy among ethnic minorities in south Bolton for this low uptake. There may be some truth to that, but those areas are also poorer than their surroundings, with shabbier public transport. Yasmin Qureshi, the Labour MP for Bolton south-east, has said that the only place for her constituents to get vaccinated until recently was a health centre in the city centre. That the bus now brings the vaccine to them is good.

The world should keep an eye on Britain's struggle with 617.2. The outbreak in Bolton has already shown that uneven vaccine coverage can offer new variants a foothold. For as long as understanding of the virus and its variants remains murky, a risk remains that any foothold can become a platform for exponential growth. That threatens everyone.

[Vaccinated individuals will mostly be protected from disease following infection with B.1.617, but unvaccinated people will be at risk. The average vaccination across Britain is 70%, which is very good, but there are pockets with lower vaccine rates. The majority of new cases in Britain are in teenagers, as the vaccination rate is lower in this population than in older age individuals. The vaccine bus is attempting to reach as many unvaccinated persons as possible. - Mod.LK]

[3] Europe: CIDRAP updates
Date: Thu 20 May 2021

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/05/europe-makes-cautious-progress-urged-monitor-covid-19-variant-spread


Europe's COVID-19 cases have dropped 60% over the past month, but progress is fragile, as the region once again is on guard against a more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variant, B1617, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) European regional office said today [20 May 2021]. Hans Henri Kluge, MD, MPH, the group's director, said, "We have been here before. Let us not make the same mistakes that were made this time last year."

Some European countries took reopening steps this week, with, for example, United Kingdom residents returning to pubs and Parisians dining in outdoor cafes again.

Kluge warned that several countries have pockets of transmission that could fuel dangerous resurgences, and he noted that case incidence is still high in 8 countries. So far, 26 of 53 countries in the WHO's European region have identified cases of B1617, the variant first detected in India. He said most cases have links to international travel, but onward transmission is occurring, and the virus has the capacity to displace Europe's dominant B117 variant.

He urged countries that are easing restrictions to double down on measures such as testing, sequencing, isolation, contact tracing, and vaccination. Many people in the region are still susceptible to the virus, with only 23% currently immunized with a single dose and only 11% fully vaccinated, Kluge said. "Vaccines may be a light at the end of the tunnel -- but we cannot be blinded by that light."

In other European developments, the UK government yesterday [19 May 2021] announced the launch of the world's 1st clinical trial to look at the impact of a 3rd "booster" vaccine dose on immune response. The study is taking place in 2886 participants across 16 sites throughout the United Kingdom, with scientists assessing 7 vaccines. Initial findings are expected in September [2021] and will guide recommendations for fall vaccination, designed to shore up protection over the winter [https://www.gov.uk/government/news/world-first-covid-19-vaccine-booster-study-launches-in-uk].

Meanwhile, Public Health England today [20 May 2021] released estimates on the impact of the current vaccination program, including that the vaccine prevented 13 000 deaths through 9 May 2021 in people older than 60. It also estimated that vaccination prevented 39 100 hospitalizations in those over age 65 [https://twitter.com/PHE_uk/status/1395382011108499456].

Regarding travel as the summer tourism season approaches, the European Union today [20 May 2021] announced a final agreement on a "green digital certificate," which will allow vaccinated people to travel freely across borders [https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_21_2593].

More global headlines
- In India, daily deaths dropped below 4000 a day after setting a global record, but cases were up compared with the previous day.

- Africa's vaccine rollout has not only been hampered by a supply bottleneck due to a stall in a COVAX vaccine produced by India's Serum Institute but also by a lack of financial resources in some countries to put the shots into peoples' arms, the head of the WHO's African regional office, Matshidiso Moeti, MBBS, said today [20 May 2021] at a briefing. She added that the supply gap can be filled if developed countries donate doses, but some countries need help developing operational plans to best use their supplies, which includes hiring vaccinators, cold-chain storage, logistics, and transportation [https://worldhealthorganization.cmail20.com/t/ViewEmail/d/C4439A71B0E1ABE62540EF23F30FEDED/7979A0F208459AE6419C69E1CEBE89F9].

- Malaysia today [20 May 2021] reported a record single-day high of more than 6000 cases, according to CNN [https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/coronavirus-pandemic-vaccine-updates-05-20-21/h_6cfb73e03521c3defa91b85c625 cb07c].

- In the Americas, Panama is closing its border with Colombia to slow the spread of the virus, and in Brazil, Sao Paulo state -- the country's most populous -- is easing restrictions, despite rises in cases and deaths.

- The global total today [20 May 2021] topped 165 million and is now at 165 085 000 cases, along with 3 421 409 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins online dashboard [https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html].

[4] Argentina: lockdown

Argentina will tighten pandemic lockdown measures to combat a severe 2nd COVID-19 wave, President Alberto Fernandez said on Thursday [20 May 2021], underscoring concern as daily cases and deaths have broken records over the last week.

The strict "circuit-breaker" measures will come into force on Saturday [22 May 2021] and last until 31 May 2021. They include school and non-essential commerce closures and the banning of social, religious and sporting events in the nation of 45 million people.

"We are living the worst moment since the pandemic began," Fernandez said. "Today as never before we must all take care of ourselves to avoid all the losses that we can."

Citizens who are not classed as essential workers will be allowed to be out close to their homes between 6 am and 6 pm; otherwise, they must stay at home.

The restrictions come as the government accelerates a vaccination campaign that has lagged ambitious initial plans. So far, only 4.7% of the population has been fully inoculated and 18.4% has received at least one dose, according to a Reuters analysis.

Fernandez also announced an economic rescue package for sectors worst-hit by the pandemic, which has exacerbated a crisis that has plagued the country for the past 3 years and left millions of Argentines in poverty.

Argentina posted 35 884 new COVID-19 cases on Thursday [20 May 2021] after hitting a record high 39 652 on Wednesday [19 May 2021]. Total infections number some 3.45 million, which puts the country ahead of hard-hit Brazil on a per capita basis and has pushed hospital intensive care units to near-saturation. There have been 72 699 confirmed deaths.

[Argentina is restricting circulation and closing nonessential businesses until the end of May 2021 in an effort to check the rapid spread of COVID-19. There have been a series of lockdowns and movement restrictions imposed to control the disease from March 2020 until 8 Nov 2020. The latest renewed lockdown measures will take effect tomorrow (22 May 2021) in most parts of the country, where the number of cases and deaths from the coronavirus are high.

Responses to the outbreak have included restrictions on commerce and movement, closure of borders, and the closure of schools and educational institutions. Clusters of infections and deaths have occurred in nursing homes, prisons and other detention centers, and urban areas.

So far Argentina has applied 10.5 million doses of vaccines -- a combination of Russia's Sputnik V, China's Sinopharm, and Covishield, the Indian version of the AstraZeneca jab, but less than 5% of its population of around 45 million has been fully inoculated. - Mod.UBA]

[In the past 24 hours, India (259 269), Brazil (83 367), Argentina (35 884), and the USA (30 214) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 13 026 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 18 May 2021 to late 19 May 2021). Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (8 countries) include India, Brazil, Argentina, the USA, Colombia (16 086), France (15 415), Iran (12 426), and Germany (10 727). A total of 56 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 28 of the 56 countries are from the European region, 7 are from the Americas region, 10 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 6 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 2 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 16.7%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 2.7%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 21.4% decrease in daily reported cases and a 5.1% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily report counted over 650 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 165.84 million cumulative reported cases and over 3.44 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
