US Government Conducts Inventory of Laboratory Stocks of Poliovirus
--------------------------------------------------
The federal government is taking an inventory of poliovirus strains in labs
around the country as part of an effort to prevent the virus from
accidentally escaping and causing outbreaks once the disease is eradicated.
All 31 000 institutions that have poliovirus stocks -- including health
departments, hospitals and private companies -- have until Tue [31 Dec
2002] to submit reports to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The CDC is also asking labs that no longer need to work with the virus to
destroy any stocks they have. Slightly more than half of the 31 000
institutions have already submitted reports. Many have asked for extensions.
Federal officials have said poliomyelitis could be eradicated worldwide
within 2 years. Health officials learned a lesson from what happened with
the smallpox virus. That disease was eradicated from the world in 1977, but
less than a year after the self-congratulatory ceremonies, 2 smallpox cases
emerged from a lab in the United Kingdom. "When polio is eradicated, every
effort must be made to ensure that wild poliovirus is not similarly
transmitted from the laboratory," the CDC said.
Poliovirus, which can cause paralysis and death, is not thought to be as
dangerous as smallpox virus as a bioterrorist weapon, because fewer than 1
percent of those infected with poliovirus develop symptoms. People around
the world also have been vaccinated against poliovirus for decades.
However, the heightened focus on smallpox has made health officials much
more vigilant about the poliovirus inventory, said Dr. Donald Hopkins,
associate executive director of the Carter Center in Atlanta and a former
CDC deputy director.
There are only 10 countries where polio is endemic, and last year there
were fewer than 500 cases worldwide. The last U.S. outbreak happened in 1979.

[European countries are also cataloguing all laboratory stocks of
poliovirus as part of a global plan to ensure effective containment and
control of virulent poliovirus in a poliomyelitis-free world. Clearly,
documentation and control of the use of virulent poliovirus in laboratories
is a prudent measure. There can be few situations in diagnosis or research
where virulent poliovirus cannot be substituted by live attenuated poliovirus.
The comparison with smallpox is not exact. Smallpox virus (_Variola virus_)
and the vaccine virus (_Vaccinia virus_) are distinct virus species, and
vaccinia virus cannot be transmuted into virulent smallpox virus by current
technology. The 3 serotypic strains of poliovirus attenuated by Albert
Sabin, on the other hand, differ by relatively few mutations from their
virulent progenitors. The mutations responsible for the reduced
neurovirulence of poliovirus type 1 comprise a single mutation in the
5'-untranslated region (UTR), 2 amino acid substitutions in VP1, and one
each in VP3 and VP4; the mutations in poliovirus type 2 comprise a single
mutation in the 5'UTR region and a single amino acid substitution in VP1;
and the mutations in poliovirus type 3 comprise a single mutation in the
5'-UTR and a single amino acid exchange in VP4.
The Sabin vaccine viruses can and do revert to virulence even within a
single individual, but are contained by the immune response induced by the
majority attenuated component of the vaccine. Total destruction of virulent
virus is an unachievable aim, since reversion to virulence can occur
naturally, and the technology exists widely to reconstruct virulent virus
by the recombinant DNA route or by chemical synthesis as demonstrated
recently by Wimmer and colleagues. The requirement is to achieve
universally acceptable systems of control and surveillance rather than
eradication of virulent poliovirus -- at least until such time as the
attenuated polioviruses can be withdrawn from use also. - Mod.CP]
