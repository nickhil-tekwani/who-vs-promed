CCPP, the most serious of the respiratory mycoplasmosis of goats was earlier
believed to be caused by _Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. capri_ or _M. mycoides
subsp. mycoides_ LC subtype. More recently another mycoplasma _M. capricolum
subsp. caprineumonia_ (_M. caprineumonia_) was found to be responsible for
the classical form of the CCPP.
Studies on goat pneumonias associated with mycoplasma in Tanzania have been
done. Different mycoplasmas were isolated including _M. mycoides subsp.
capri_ and _M. mycoides subsp. mycoides_ LC subtype (belonging to mycoplasma
mycoides cluster), _M. ovipneumoniae_, _M. agalactiae_. Others included _M.
conjuctivae_ and _M. arginini_. In that study, _M. caprineumonia_ was not
isolated despite special attention paid during cultivation.
Tanzania has been mentioned in one publication in 1977 as a country where
CCPP occurs. The FAO-WHO- OIE Yearbooks (at least up to 1990) could not
confirm this statement. During recent years CCPP has been suspected in the
Northern regions of Tanzania without any confirmed outbreaks. The recent
heavy rains which started in October last year due to El-nino weather
phenomenon have resulted in floods in many parts of the country and an
upsurge of animal diseases including goat pleuropneumonias. Laboratory
investigation of suspected CCPP outbreak in Pawaga, Iringa in April 1998,
revealed negative results for _M. caprineumonia_. Therefore, classical CCPP
is yet to be confirmed in Tanzania.

Animal Health Officer (Disease Intelligence), Animal Health Service, FAO,
Rome, and Peter Roeder of the same organisation. I am glad to hear so
authoritatively that the situation in Northern Tanzania does not involve
CCPP. - Mod.MHJ
