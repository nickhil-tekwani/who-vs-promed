Relief as lab tests give pigs all clear from foot-and-mouth
-----------------------------------------------
Farmers breathed sighs of relief after the pigs tested for
foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] received the all clear. [For the
official notification, dated 9 Jan 2007, see item 2].
It followed a tense day in which both the farm where the pigs were
sourced and the [County] Antrim abattoir where suspicions were
aroused were placed under animal movement restrictions. These were
lifted late yesterday [9 Jan 2007] afternoon.
The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development confirmed that
the pigs had tested negative for both FMD and swine vesicular disease
(SVD), which displays identical clinical symptoms.
Chief veterinary officer Bert Houston said: "Negative results from
the laboratory tests mean that we have ruled out suspicion of FMD and
SVD. Restrictions are being lifted on the abattoir and the farm from
which the pigs originated. We picked up this suspect case as part of
routine surveillance. We expect to have cases like this from time to
time, and this shows our alert systems are operating effectively. It
also demonstrates that we are in a position to take necessary steps
quickly in a suspect disease situation. Good bio-security is a best
line of defense for these diseases, and I would like to thank the
abattoir and the farm concerned for their vigilance and cooperation
on this issue."
Robert Overend, chairman of the Ulster Pork and Bacon Forum, said he
was absolutely delighted to hear the news. "Everyone will be
breathing a sigh of relief because FMD is considered a very, very
serious disease right across the world," he said.

Negative Results For Foot And Mouth And Swine Fever
-----------------------------------------------
The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development [DARD] has
confirmed that tests on pigs for FMD SVD are negative.
Movement restrictions are now being lifted on the [County] Antrim
abattoir and Co Down farm following receipt of these negative test results.
Bert Houston, Chief Veterinary Officer said: "Negative results today
from the laboratory tests mean that we have ruled out suspicion of
FMD and SVD. Restrictions are now being lifted on the abattoir and
the farm from which the pigs originated. We picked up this suspect
case as part of routine surveillance. We expect to have cases like
this from time to time and this shows our alert systems are operating
effectively. It also demonstrates that we are in a position to take
necessary steps quickly in a suspect disease situation."
In conclusion, Mr. Houston said: "Good bio-security is a best line of
defense for these diseases, and I would like to thank the abattoir
and the farm concerned for their vigilance and cooperation on this issue."
Notes for editors:
1. The symptoms of Swine Vesicular Disease in pigs are difficult to
distinguish from those of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD).
2. As a precautionary measure and in accordance with EU requirements,
on 8 Jan 2007 DARD imposed some limited animal movement restrictions.
3. Test results are negative for Foot and Mouth Disease and Swine
Vesicular Disease.

[Timely investigations into suspected outbreaks of infectious animal
diseases are indispensable for their early detection, followed by
timely control and eradication activities. This is of particular
importance when vesicular diseases -- having the potential for
extensive and quick spread -- are suspected. The handling of the
current Northern Ireland event seems exemplary.
Similar investigations are carried out in FMD-free countries
regularly. In the UK, for example, there were 14 investigations into
suspect vesicular disease conditions during 2005, all having proved
negative (see a recent example at
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2006/061027c.htm>). Figures during
other years are of similar scale. - Mod.AS]
