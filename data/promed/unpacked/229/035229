The British Columbia Centre for Disease Control [BCCDC] is warning
that jars of watermelon jelly that were sold at charity booths around
BC the summer of 2010 could contain botulism.

A rare case of botulism on Vancouver Island has sparked a recall of
120 ml jars of the jelly made by Jamnation Fine Foods, according to
Sion Shyng, a food safety specialist at the BCCDC. "The jelly was sold
through the British Columbia Huntingtons Research Foundation charity
booths in Duncan, and may also have been sold in other parts of
province," explains Shyng. "We're concerned that this product may
still be in the homes of consumers as jellies can be stored and
consumed long after they are purchased."

The BCCDC is currently working with BC Health Authorities and the BC
Ministry of Health Services to ensure the recalled product is removed
from distribution and is investigating any possible cases of illness.

[Home and even commercial foods that are preserved by canning
techniques in cans or jars can transmit botulism. If not inactivated
by the proper heating, spores of _Clostridium botulinum_ can germinate
and produce the neurotoxin which affects neurotransmission by blocking
one of several steps in the neuronal synapse.

Symptoms of foodborne botulism usually develop 18 to 36 hours after
ingestion of the food containing the toxin, although cases have varied
from 4 hours to 8 days. Early signs of intoxication consist of marked
lassitude, weakness, and vertigo, usually followed by double vision
and progressive difficulty in speaking and swallowing. Difficulty in
breathing, weakness of other muscles, abdominal distention, and
constipation may also be common symptoms.

The types of foods involved in botulism vary according to food
preservation and eating habits in different regions. Any food that is
conducive to outgrowth and toxin production which, when processed,
allows spore survival and is not subsequently heated before
consumption can be associated with botulism. Almost any type of food
that is not very acidic (pH above 4.6) can support growth and toxin
production by _Clostridium botulinum_. Botulinum toxin has been
demonstrated in a considerable variety of foods, such as canned corn,
peppers, green beans, soups, beets, asparagus, mushrooms, ripe olives,
spinach, tuna fish, chicken and chicken livers and liver pate,
luncheon meats, ham, sausage, stuffed eggplant, lobster, and smoked
and salted fish.

The incidence of the disease is low, but the mortality rate is high
if not treated immediately and properly. Some cases of botulism may go
undiagnosed because symptoms are transient or mild, or misdiagnosed as
Guillain-Barre syndrome.

Botulinum toxin causes flaccid paralysis by blocking motor nerve
terminals at the myoneural (nerve-muscle) junction. The flaccid
paralysis progresses symmetrically downward, usually starting with the
eyes and face, to the throat, chest, and extremities. When the
diaphragm and chest muscles become fully involved, respiration is
inhibited and death from asphyxia results. Recommended treatment for
foodborne botulism includes early administration of botulinum
antitoxin and intensive supportive care (including mechanical
breathing assistance).

All people are believed to be susceptible to the foodborne
intoxication.

Although botulism can be diagnosed by clinical symptoms alone,
differentiation from other diseases may be difficult. The most direct
and effective way to confirm the clinical diagnosis of botulism is to
demonstrate the presence of toxin in the serum or feces of the patient
or in the food which the patient consumed. Determination of the source
of an outbreak is based on detection and identification of toxin in
the food involved. The most widely accepted method is the injection of
extracts of the food into passively immunized mice (mouse
neutralization test). The test takes 48 hours. This analysis is
followed by culturing all suspect food in an enrichment medium for the
detection and isolation of the causative organism. This test takes 7
days. - Mod.LL
