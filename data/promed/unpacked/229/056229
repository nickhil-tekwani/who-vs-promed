Recovery of 4 novel _Potato spindle tuber viroid_ sequence variants
from Russian seed potatoes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First described in the early 1930s, the limited distribution of
potato "gothic" disease made it of little economic significance in
European Russia until the early 1970s when meristem-tip culture was
widely adopted throughout the former USSR to increase production of
virus-free seed potatoes. Shortly thereafter, the yield and quality
of Russian seed potatoes began a dramatic decline. Symptoms of potato
"gothic" resemble those of _Potato spindle tuber viroid_ (PSTVd) (3),
and initial suspicions that in vitro plantlets and seed potatoes
might be viroid-infected were later proved correct when Kastalyeva et
al (2) showed that approximately 50 to 70 percent of in vitro
plantlets and tubers collected from different regions of Russia as
well as the in vitro germplasm collection maintained by the
All-Russian Potato Research Institute (ARPRI, VNIIF) were infected
with PSTVd. Measures have since been taken to reduce the incidence of
PSTVd infection, and numerous PSTVd isolates were collected from
territories of the former USSR; however, none of these isolates have
been characterized at the molecular level.
Four PSTVd isolates maintained in field-grown tubers at the VNIIF
were subjected to sequence analysis. This revealed the presence of 4
previously unknown PSTVd variants. All 4 tubers were also infected
with _Potato virus M_ and _Potato virus Y_ and one tuber also
contained _Potato virus S_. Tests for _Potato leaf roll virus_ were
negative. Each isolate appeared to contain only a single nucleotide
variant differing from PSTVd-intermediate strain at 2-5 positions.
The 3 closely related variants originating from Leningradskaya
Province (Northwest Russia) contained 2 to 3 nucleotide changes and
induced intermediate symptoms in Rutgers tomato. The 4th variant
originating from Samarskaya Province (Volga River Region) contained
additional changes and induced mild symptoms. Minor differences among
the Leningradskaya variants may represent sequence drift during
extended (9-11 years) tuber passage. The presence of additional
sequence changes in the variant from Samarskaya is consistent with
independent origin and/or prolonged separation. Additional studies
with a wider range of Russian isolates of PSTVd are currently
underway to develop diagnostic methods suitable for future
large-scale screening programs.

[PSTVd affects solanaceous crops causing severe losses in potato (up
to 65 percent) and tomato (up to 50 percent). Resistant cultivars are
not available. In the EU it is listed as an A1 quarantine pathogen.
Spread occurs via infected tubers or plants, seed, pollen, mechanical
means, or plant-to-plant contact. Only in the presence of _Potato
leaf roll virus_ it can also be transmitted by an aphid vector
(_Myzus persicae_).
Meristem tip culture is a form of tissue culture that has been used
to obtain virus-free material for plant propagation. Intra-cellular
plant pathogens -- such as viruses and viroids -- spread from cell to
cell and newly formed cells in the meristem will be invaded. If the
meristem is removed from the older infected cells before the pathogen
has spread, virus/viroid-free cell lines can be obtained. However, it
is necessary to verify the virus/viroid free status of the resulting
lines. For PSTVd, more than 50 percent of resulting plantlets were
found to be viroid-free when cold-treatment (6 months at 6-8 deg C
(43-46 deg F) preceded meristem tip culture (Lizarraga et al 1980;
Phytopath. 70, 754).
'Novel' in this context means 'taxonomically new'. A novel strain of
a known pathogen can vary in important disease aspects such as type
of symptoms induced and host range. In many cases just a few
nucleotide changes have been found to lead to major changes in the
pathogen/host interaction. This stresses the importance of
biosecurity even for pathogens that are already present in a certain
area since there may be strains of increased virulence imported from
elsewhere. On the other hand, mild strains or strains which induce no
symptoms at all can be used in some instances for protecting host
plants from infection with severe strains.
