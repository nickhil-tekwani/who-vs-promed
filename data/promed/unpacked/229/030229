Resume cattle restocking exercise
---------------------------------
Kazungula district commissioner Fred Siasuntwe has appealed to the Ministry
of Agriculture and Cooperatives to resume the cattle restocking in the
district in Zambia now that the contagious bovine pleural pneumonia (CBPP)
has been eradicated. Mr Siasuntwe made the appeal in Kazungula yesterday
[21 Apr 2009], saying the disease had been brought under control, hence the
need to resume the programme which was halted in 2006 after the outbreak of
the disease.

Kazungula has suffered cattle depletion for years when the CBPP broke out
from Sesheke following the collapse of the cordon line. The collapse of the
cordon line allowed the movement of cattle from Angola and Namibia into
Sesheke up to Kazungula, thereby spreading the diseases along the way.

Several contingents of veterinary department personnel were dispatched to
the district to fight off the disease. The department introduced the
programme under which animals were tested for the disease and those found
to be positive were slaughtered and owners of animals were given money.
Some of the farmers had been crippled after losing cattle because they were
now lacking draught power.

Mr Siasuntwe said while cattle restocking continued in other areas in
Monze, Kalomo, Choma and others, the programme was suspended in Kazungula
to fight off CBPP. He said now that the other districts were grappling with
the corridor disease the cattle restocking programme should be suspended
until the disease cleared.

Kazungula had a cattle population of 40 000 but about 15 000 animals were
slaughtered under the programme to fight the CBPP.

[During 2007, Zambia reported 15 outbreaks of CBBP (6 in the North Western,
9 in the Western, none in the Southern Administrative divisions). During
the 1st semester of 2008, 13 outbreaks were reported (6 in the North West,
7 in the South). No information on number of outbreaks during the 2nd
semester of 2008 is yet available on the OIE WAHID website, but the site
says that, during 2008, the disease was present, "limited to one or more
zones."

No OIE notifications on any change of the CBPP situation in Zambia are
available since 2005; a clarification on the actual current disease
situation would be helpful. - Mod.AS]
