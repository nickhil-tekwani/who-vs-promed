ERYSIPELAS, KANGAROOS - UK (ZOO): REQUEST FOR INFO

We have recently confirmed an outbreak of Erysipelas in kangaroos at a
wildlife park in UK. We would be interested to know of other outbreaks:
description, experiences, control.
The outbreak of _Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae_ is primarily in Red
Kangaroos. The affected group is a mixed group of 10 Red kangaroos, 12 Grey
Kangaroos and 22 Wallabies.
Their environment is free range on old iron ore mine workings of 2 acres
consisting of short grass, steep slope with blackthorn and scrub. Area
becomes very muddy in wet weather. The animals have access to heated
shelters. They are fed hay ad libitum and a concentrate macropod diet and
pony cubes, in troughs indoors. Fruit is given most days.
In the past, health problems have included "Lumpy jaw" and swollen foot
lesions for several years, and have been attributed to thorn and holly
bushes. Otherwise the adults are generally healthy. Some losses recently in
the Joeys [young] which have not been fully investigated. There is a
Clostridial vaccination program.
Regarding erysipelas, the clinical history is 4 deaths in 10 days of adult
red kangaroos. They have acute malaise with no specific clinical signs.
First case reportedly had some hemorrhage from the respiratory tract.
Specimens from the third case were sent to a diagnostic laboratory, and the
whole carcase of the fourth for post mortem examination. The fourth case had
been receiving potentiated sulfonamides for a swollen maxilla, which had
responded to treatment.
The post mortem examination reveled generalized subcutaneous ecchymotic
hemorrhages, with a single very severe hemorrhagic lesion affecting the
cranial and maxillary subcutaneous tissue, and internal organ congestion.
Additionally, there was gum retraction, gingivitis with tracking lesions/
infections along the margins of the cheek teeth. _Erysipelothrix
rhusiopathiae_ was isolated in profuse pure growths from the internal organs
and the severe hemorrhagic head lesion. _E. rhusiopathiae_ was also isolated
from specimens of third case.
We are interested to know of other outbreaks: description, experiences,
control, and any other assistance you can provide.

[_Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae_ is distributed worldwide and can live in
water, soil, decaying organic matter, slime on the bodies of fish, and in
carcasses, even after processing. The bacterium has a variable survival time
in soil, but not usually greater than 35 days. However, animal hosts may
cause recontamination of an area.
It causes swine erysipelas in its various forms: nonsuppurative arthritis in
lambs and less frequently in calves and kids; post dipping lameness in
sheep; uncommonly, joint-ill in goats; and acute septicemia in turkeys,
ducks, and occasionally geese and other birds.
In man the infection is usually localized and is termed erysipeloid. (It
should not be confused with erysipelas in man, a superficial cellulitis
caused by a group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus).
In acute disease, _E. rhusiopathiae_ usually occurs as a slender,
gram-positive rod, approximately 1 micrometer long. In chronic lesions and
old cultures, it often appears as a mixture of rods and filaments up to 20
micrometers long.
It is resistant to certain commonly used antiseptics, such as formaldehyde,
phenol, hydrogen peroxide and alcohol, but is readily destroyed by caustic
soda and hypochlorites. It is very sensitive to penicillin or ceftiofur but
less so to the tetracyclines. The many strains vary markedly in
pathogenicity. - Mod.TG]
