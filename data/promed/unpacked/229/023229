[This immediate notification complements the information already published in ProMED-mail posting 20190909.6664694.

"Swine production in the Philippines is a PHP 191-billion (USD 3.7 billion) industry and is the largest among the livestock and poultry industries of the country. It ranks next to rice with 18.28 [percent] contribution to the total value of agricultural production. Swine production plays a major role in ensuring the country's food security by providing about 60 [percent] of the total animal meat consumption of Filipinos. The Philippine swine industry is ranked 8th in the world in terms of the volume of pork production and number of breeding sows. However, [the] majority or about 65% of the pigs in the Philippines are kept by small-hold pig raisers." (Source: http://www.pcaarrd.dost.gov.ph/home/portal/index.php/quick-information-dispatch/2681-philippine-pork-to-the-world).

Based on the possible sources of infection and on the epidemiological comment made, "Suspected swill feeding, then spread through illegal movement of already sick pigs that were being sold at a lower price," the probability that the disease has spread to other areas within the country is high.

"Given the global socioeconomic repercussions of ASF, controlling the disease is a high priority for both affected countries and those free of the disease. It is for this reason that that the OIE calls on its Member Countries to ensure that they implement its standards and practices for the effective control of ASF, notably through the implementation of:

- Programmes for prevention, early detection and intervention, and compensation policies
- Biosecurity measures
- Pig traceability and movement controls
- Effective official monitoring
- Management of wild pig populations
- Slaughter of animals in accordance with animal welfare rules, and the safe disposal of contaminated animal products
- Improvement in collaboration between stakeholders and between countries
- Programmes of ongoing training and awareness raising

"Because of its complex epidemiology, it isn't possible to control ASF without a coordinated response from the different sectors involved. In addition to Veterinary Services, this includes customs and border control authorities, the pig production industry, universities, forestry management bodies, hunters' associations, tourist organisations and animal transport organisations. Clear and transparent communication is essential if all these actors are to fully understand their roles and responsibilities in the implementation of the measures required."
