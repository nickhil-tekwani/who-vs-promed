Nature shock: cannibal hippos
-----------------------------
In 2004, the Queen Elizabeth National Park [QENP] in Uganda was
confronted with a most disturbing mystery. Not only had some fool
commissioned another series of Wild At Heart, but, after a long spell
of dry weather, hippopotamuses began dying in large numbers along the
shores of the Kazinga Channel. Carcasses were found bobbing in the
water next to live hippos and the initial theory that the deaths were
caused by fighting was ruled out when keepers discovered a number of
peaceable females among the dead. Park wardens theorised that
poaching was to blame, until they saw that the ivory teeth of the
animals had been left intact. Vets then began to wonder if the deaths
were due to an infection. And tests revealed that the culprit was
indeed anthrax.

It became a race against time to identify the source of the outbreak
before more animals became infected. But how was it that hippos all
over the park were dying? The answer came when vets noticed some
unusual behaviour -- hippos chewing on the carcasses' intestines,
which had been expelled from the body by the gases inside. With the
dry weather killing off vegetation, the hippos had been forced to
seek other food sources -- including their own kind. The notion was
initially met with derision -- not least because hippos never eat
meat. But the astonishing theory now seemed irrefutable --
hunger-stricken hippos in Uganda were eating the infected corpses of
their brethren, only to become infected with anthrax themselves.

Episode 2: cannibal hippos
--------------------------
In August 2004, the Queen Elizabeth National Park in Uganda was
confronted with a most disturbing mystery. After a long spell of dry
weather, hippopotamuses began dying in large numbers along the shores
of the Kazinga Channel. Carcasses were found bobbing in the water
next to live hippos. The initial theory that the deaths were caused
by fighting was ruled out when keepers discovered a number of
peaceable females amongst the dead. "When the number became bigger is
when I became worried," says keeper Peter Acheroi. "It had never
happened before."

Park wardens theorised that poaching was to blame, until they saw
that the ivory teeth of the animals had been left intact. With the
death toll rising, chief wildlife vet Dr Patrick Atimnedi travelled
to the park to assess the situation. "Why the consistency in
mortalities and why these numbers?" he asks. The decomposing corpses
posed a risk to human and animal life, and the gruesome spectacle
threatened the park's burgeoning tourist industry.

Vets began to wonder if the deaths were due to an infection. Dr Risto
Heinonen, a Finnish vet based in Africa, thought he recognised the
symptoms. "These are criteria that fit very well with anthrax," he
says. Anthrax is spread by spores found naturally in patches of
earth. Outbreaks occur occasionally in African countries, but they
usually involve more than one species of animal. "How is it that it
affects only hippos? Where did it come from?" Heinonen asks.

Samples from an autopsy on one of the dead hippos were sent to
Germany for analysis. Epidemiologist Fabian Leendertz concluded that
the infection was indeed anthrax. It became a race against time to
identify the source of the outbreak before more animals became
infected. With the government on a state of alert, workers began
burying the corpses in the park. Leendertz flew to Uganda to assist
in the operation and quickly ruled out his theory that the water was
contaminated.

Leendertz now speculated that the anthrax originated in the hippos'
diet. It was most likely caused by hippos eating plants from infected
soil. But infected areas are usually quite small, so how was it that
hippos all over the park were dying? The answer came when Leendertz
noticed unusual behaviour in the hippos still living in the Kazinga
Channel. "Around the carcass there were always other hippos... and
they were really interested in the carcass," he says. "That was a bit
suspicious for me." Then he saw hippos chewing on the carcasses'
intestines, which had been expelled from the body by the gases inside.

Leendertz's theory held that, with the dry weather killing off
vegetation, the hippos had been forced to seek other food sources --
including their own kind. But the notion was met with derision -- not
least because hippos never eat meat. "We have never seen a hippo
eating meat, we know that hippos are vegetarian," says Nicholas
Kauta, head of the clean-up operation.

In search of further evidence, Leendertz read an article by a Dr
Joseph Dudley, who had witnessed a hippo eating an impala in Zimbabwe
[JP Dudley: Reports of carnivory by the common hippo _Hippopotamus
amphibius_". South African Journal of Wildlife Research (1998)28(2):
58-9 (abstract available at
<http://www.sabinet.co.za/abstracts/wild/wild_v28_n2_a4.html>). -
Mod.JW]. Then footage came to light of a hippo in Malawi eating a
hippo carcass. The astonishing theory now seemed irrefutable --
hunger-stricken hippos in Uganda were eating the infected corpses of
their brethren, only to become infected with anthrax themselves. This
explained the spread of the outbreak and why it was restricted to one
species. "The hippopotamus then becomes the world's largest
omnivore," says Dr Dudley, "and, as far as I can tell, the only such
mega-omnivore in the past 20 million years."

[Hippos have been recognised as cannibals for a number of years. This
epidemic in Uganda was a puzzler because it lasted so very long, from
June 2004 through to March 2005, with 287 official cases. - Mod.MHJ]

Basically the epidemic started at one point, maybe 2, and then
progressed continuously. This is atypical for normal point-source
anthrax outbreaks, which would have resulted in a more patchy
distribution and probably fewer dead animals.

The explanation of cannibalism came through my observation that they
were eating the expelled intestines of dead animals. In this way one
index case when eaten would result in the group being infected, and so onwards.

Analyses of water were negative, possibly due to the dilution effects
of water currents and animal activity.

My observation of cannibalism needs to be confirmed by others.

In a 2004 letter to ProMED-mail (archive number 20041214.3308), I
speculated that the large numbers of anthrax fatalities among hippos
during the 2004 anthrax outbreak in QENP, when contrasted with
notable lack of contemporaneous observations of observed anthrax
cases among buffalo and other normally susceptible ungulate species,
suggested that cannibalism of anthrax-infected hippo carcasses might
be driving this outbreak. [See ProMED-mail archive no. 20041215.3317
for confirmation by John Woodford.]

On a trip to the site of this outbreak earlier this year (June 2009),
my observations of the extremely high frequency and intimacy of
contacts between buffalo and hippos in water and on land within the
riparian areas of the Kazinga Channel where the outbreak occurred
appeared to support my hypothesis that some phenomenon must have been
involved in the 2004-2005 outbreak other than simple environmental
exposures of hippos and buffalo to contaminated forage, soil, or water.

Interestingly, high frequencies of anthrax mortality among hippos,
coupled with low frequencies in other species, were recorded by
Turnbull and colleagues during anthrax outbreaks in the Luangwa
Valley of Zambia in 1987 and 1988. I have seen film footage from the
Luangwa Valley of hippos feeding on buffalo carcasses, and it may be
that hippos there also occasionally feed on hippo carcasses as well,
as has been observed at sites in at least 3 countries that I am aware
of (Uganda, Tanzania, Malawi).

The much higher observed frequencies of anthrax mortality among
hippos in the 1987-1988 anthrax outbreaks suggests that that this
outbreak, like the QENP outbreak of 2004-2005, may have been
exacerbated by hippos feeding upon the carcasses of hippos and other
animals killed by anthrax.
