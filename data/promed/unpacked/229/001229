Circovirus, wild birds - The Netherlands
----------------------------------------
Increased mortality in multiple wild bird species, including gulls,
corvids, and pigeons, was reported by rehabilitation centres in The
Netherlands since the end of May. Clinical signs included ataxia, apathy,
and diarrhoea.
A total of 54 birds of 21 species were submitted to the Department of
Virology, Erasmus University, Rotterdam for pathologic and virologic
examination. Results of virus isolation and RT-PCR procedures for the
detection of flaviviruses (including West Nile virus), avian
paramyxoviruses (including Newcastle disease virus), influenza virus, and
infectious bursal disease virus were negative.
By histology, the most frequently found lesion in multiple species was
lymphocytic necrosis in lymphoid organs. The presence of a circovirus-like
agent was identified by electron microscopic examination of characteristic
basophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions in the bursa of Fabricius in 2
species: black-headed gull (_Larus ridibundus_) and domestic pigeon
(_Columba livia_). Similar inclusions were found in several other species
of birds.
Circovirus infections in birds are associated with immunodeficiency. They
are known to cause disease in chickens (chicken anaemia virus), psittacines
(psittacine beak and feather disease virus), and pigeons (pigeon
circovirus). In Europe, circovirus infection has been recorded in pigeons,
but not in other wild birds.
Further studies are underway to determine the possible relationship of the
circovirus-like agents found, the extent and distribution of the infection
in wild bird species, and their significance for the observed morbidity and
mortality.
In a collaborative effort with the National Veterinary Institute in
Uppsala, samples from wild birds in Sweden with similar clinical signs also
will be examined.
