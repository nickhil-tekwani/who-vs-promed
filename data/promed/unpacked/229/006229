2000/063 New taxonomy of _Alternaria_ species from citrus (edited by DH)
The taxonomy of citrus diseases caused by _Alternaria_ species has been
subject to controversy for many years, which has led to some confusion in
the literature. A recent taxonomic revision of some _Alternaria_ pathogens
found on citrus (Simmons, 1999), emphasised pathogens associated with brown
spot of tangerine and related hybrids and cultivars (also called brown spot
of Minneola tangelo - EPPO Alert List) and leaf spot of rough lemon
(_Citrus jambhiri_). Morphological characteristics of 135 isolates
originating from lesions on diseased citrus from citrus-growing regions of
Colombia, Israel, Turkey, South Africa and USA (Florida) and taken from
citrus lesions were examined under controlled culture conditions. Leaf
spot of rough lemon is essentially caused by _A. limoniasperae_ sp. Nov.,
and to a lesser extent by _A. citrimacularis_ sp. nov. It was concluded
that the disease called 'brown spot of Minneola tangelo', observed in many
citrus-growing regions of the world, is caused by several distinct species
of _Alternaria_. Note: this paper mentions the occurrence of _Alternaria_
brown spot in Colombia, which is a new record according to the EPPO
Secretariat.

[I decided to include this report on the assumption that it would be of
considerable interest to citrus pathologists, including those whose
interests include diseases of orange (a crop monitored by ProMED-Plant)
caused by _Alternaria_ spp. An improved taxonomy of _Alternaria_ spp.
should assist taxonomists in assigning isolates to the proper taxa. - Mod.DH
