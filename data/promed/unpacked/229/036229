From: Harry Hull <hullh@who.ch>

In regard to the "outbreak" of polio reported in the media and posted on
ProMED-mail on 9 November: The WHO office in Ethiopia reports that this
press report is based on old cases of polio. Visits to the area indicate
that there is no current outbreak. This press report was part of the
promotional campaign for the National Immunization Day campaign to immunize
all children less than 5 year of age earlier this month. A second round of
immunization is planned for December.

Although there is no major outbreak of polio in Ethiopia as indicated in
the press report, polio remains endemic in Ethiopia. This first National
Immunization Day should dampen the circulation of wild polio viruses.
However, it will require several additional years before Ethiopia will be
free of polio. The government of Ethiopia is to be congratulated for
undertaking this task.

[We thank Dr. Hull and W.H.O. for providing this clarification. It remains
remarkable to me that media reports continue to be so unreliable and
alarmist. Congratulations to Ethiopia for its efforts. - Mod.CHC
