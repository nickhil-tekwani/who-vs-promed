Since late April, illnesses have been attributed to the
microbe, called cyclospora, in Texas and at least eight other
states. Nearly 70 people also have been stricken in Toronto.
Health officials have identified 43 cases of the illness in
New York, at least 32 in New Jersey, eight in Pennsylvania, 28 in
Ohio, 71 in Florida, eight in Illinois, 28 in Massachusetts and
two in South Carolina.

Hundreds sickened by rare parasite; Texas blames strawberries
-------------------------------------------------------------
HOUSTON (AP) -- [Epidemiologists at the Texas Department of Health
have focused on strawberries for 55 confirmed and 96 suspected
cases of cyclospora-related illness in Houston.......
Elsewhere in Texas, there have been seven
cases in Austin and one in Port Lavaca.
In studying the Houston cases, epidemiologists found that
everyone who became ill had eaten strawberries......
California strawberries are being blamed because that state
produces most of the strawberries consumed at this time of year.....
The Centers for Disease Control and the Food and Drug
Administration said they were studying the apparent outbreak but
were not yet ready to draw conclusions.....
No deaths have been reported from the parasite, which can be
treated with antibiotics. Cyclospora can cause extreme watery
diarrhea, stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting and fatigue lasting
several weeks.
-- the first U.S. outbreak was [in 1990 --
