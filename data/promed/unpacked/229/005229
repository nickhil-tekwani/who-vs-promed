US 'import alert' on China food
-------------------------------
US authorities have issued a nationwide "import alert" for
Chinese-made food products in the wake of the melamine contamination
scandal. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had already issued
an alert warning Americans not to consume Chinese products containing
milk. Thousands of Chinese have been poisoned this year.

The latest alert goes beyond dairy products to such items as drinks,
sweets, and baby and pet food. It also allows US inspectors to seize
any Chinese products suspected of being contaminated.

Safety issues
-------------
The earlier restrictions were put in place on diary products after 4
Chinese children died from kidney failure and thousands more people
fell ill after consuming dairy products laced with melamine, which is
normally used in making plastics and fertiliser.

The FDA has now added more than a dozen other goods imported from
China, including biscuits, instant coffee and tea products.

In addition, US officials will be travelling to China next week for
consultations with the Chinese about safety issues. The FDA is also
planning to open three new offices in China to check products
intended for the US market.

US issues melamine alert on Chinese-made food products
------------------------------------------------------
US authorities Thursday [13 Nov 2008] issued a nationwide "import
alert" for Chinese-made food products for possible melamine
contamination and warned against consuming several products from
China including infant formula. The Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) said it had an alert in place since 10 Oct 2008 for specific
imports containing milk but that new data indicated that "a
countrywide import alert is warranted."

The FDA said it would test "a range of protein-containing products
beyond just dairy and dairy-containing products" for contamination
and would "take appropriate regulatory action" if needed. The import
alert covers a range of products including beverages, candy, baby
food and pet foods. It allows inspectors to seize any products
suspected of being contaminated.

At the same time, the FDA warned against consuming an infant formula
manufactured in China as well as more than a dozen products including
biscuit, instant coffee and tea products.

At least 4 children have died of kidney failure and 53 000 have
fallen ill in China this year after drinking milk or consuming dairy
products laced with melamine, which is usually used in making
plastics and fertilizers. The dairy scandal has expanded worldwide
with several governments recalling or banning Chinese products with
milk content.

In a related matter, the US government said FDA Commissioner Andrew
von Eschenbach and Health and Human Services Secretary Mike Leavitt
will travel to China next week "for consultations with their Chinese
counterparts" on safety issues and to open 3 new FDA offices in China.

The visit is "part of an ongoing strategy to address the food safety
issues in both countries and to share ideas to address global food
safety," a statement from Leavitt's office said.

"This will include a discussion of the recent outbreak of foodborne
illness in the United States related to fresh produce as well as the
melamine contamination of dairy products in China," the statement said.
