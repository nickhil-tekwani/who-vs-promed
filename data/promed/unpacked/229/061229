Nepal: People eating carbide-ripened mangoes fall ill
-----------------------------------------------------
People have started to fall ill after eating mangoes ripened
prematurely with the use of chemicals.

Around 30 to 40 patients come to Lahan Hospital daily on average
seeking treatment for abdominal complaints. "Most of them complain of
diarrhea, stomach pain, and nausea," said Dr Mishri Lal Sah. Dr Sah
said a majority of the complaints result from the eating of mangoes
ripened through the use of [calcium] carbide.

Mangoes ripen naturally by mid-June but businessmen use the chemical
carbide to ripen them early and fetch higher prices. "Carbide has a
negative effect on the stomach and intestines," Dr Pashupati
Chaudhary said.

Chief of District Public Health Office Dr Raj Kumar Chaudhary said
the number of patients coming in with stomach complaints is higher
compared to last year [2009]. Sagarmatha Zonal Hospital has also
reported a rise in the inflow of patients with upset stomachs.

Siraha and Saptari districts are major mango producers in the
country. The Agriculture Development Office, Siraha said that mango
varieties like maldaha, dasahari, and kalkatiya that normally mature
at the end of June appeared in the market in late May [2010].

Doctors say these mangoes, ripened prematurely through the use of
carbide, are harmful to health although they look very attractive and
tasty. They suggest that consumers instead buy green mangoes and keep
them in a warm place to ripen them.

[Calcium carbide is used to ripen fruit prematurely or ahead of its
natural cycle. A tray of mangos is covered with plastic and small
container of calcium carbide is placed under the plastic. The plastic
causes the fruit to sweat, or produce moisture. The moisture combines
with the calcium carbide to produce acetylene. Acetylene is known to
cause some neurological signs. Acetylene intoxication has long been
known because it is produced in some welding of metals. While welders
become intoxicated through inhalation, in this situation it may be
through ingestion. - Mod.TG]
