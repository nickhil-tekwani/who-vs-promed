Moderna is the 2nd company to report preliminary results from a large trial testing a vaccine. But there are still months to go before it will be widely available to the public. The drugmaker Moderna announced on Monday [16 Nov 2020] that its coronavirus vaccine was 94.5 per cent effective, joining Pfizer as a front-runner in the global race to contain a raging pandemic that has killed 1.2 million people worldwide [now over 1.3 million: see below. - Mod.SH].

Both companies plan to apply within weeks to the [US] Food and Drug Administration for emergency authorization to begin vaccinating the public. Officials said enough vaccine for about 20 million people would be ready sometime in December [2020], with the 1st doses going to people with the highest risk, like healthcare workers, emergency medical workers, and frail residents of nursing homes. But a vaccine that would be widely available to the public is still months away, while the need for one is growing increasingly urgent.

Public health officials greeted Moderna's news with a modicum of excitement, especially when viewed alongside the data released last week by Pfizer, which, in collaboration with BioNTech, reported that its vaccine was more than 90 per cent effective. The 2 companies were the 1st to announce interim data from large studies. 10 other vaccine makers are also conducting big phase 3 trials, including efforts in Australia, Britain, China, India, and Russia. More than 50 other candidates are in earlier stages of testing.

The Food and Drug Administration has said that coronavirus vaccines should be at least 50 per cent effective to be approved.

Moderna also reported on Monday [16 Nov 2020] that its vaccine had a longer shelf life under refrigeration and at room temperature than previously reported, which should make it easier to store and use.

Based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the company developed its vaccine in collaboration with researchers from the Vaccine Research Center, part of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Dr Anthony S Fauci, director of the institute, said in an interview: "I had been saying I would be satisfied with a 75 per cent effective vaccine. Aspirationally, you would like to see 90, 95 per cent, but I wasn't expecting it. I thought we'd be good, but 94.5 per cent is very impressive."

Researchers test vaccines by inoculating some study participants and giving others placebos and then watching the 2 groups to see how many people get sick. In Moderna's study, 95 people contracted the coronavirus: 5 who were vaccinated, and 90 who received placebo shots of saltwater. Statistically, the difference between the 2 groups was highly significant. And of the 95 cases, 11 were severe -- all in the placebo group. The 95 cases included 15 people 65 or older and 20 people who were Hispanic, Black, Asian, or multiracial. The company said the vaccine appeared equally safe and effective in all the subgroups. The results were analyzed by an independent data safety monitoring board, appointed by the National Institutes of Health.

At a news briefing on Monday [16 Nov 2020], Dr Fauci and Dr Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, emphasized that the hopeful news did not mean people could let down their guard. On the contrary, they implored the public to "double down" on mask-wearing, social distancing, handwashing, and avoiding crowds, and to stay that course until vaccines become available. That message was echoed by the head of the World Health Organization, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who said in a video, "A vaccine on its own will not end the pandemic."

Stephane Bancel, the chief executive of Moderna, said in a statement that the results had provided "the 1st clinical validation that our vaccine can prevent COVID-19 disease, including severe disease." Pfizer's chief executive, Dr Albert Boula, tweeted congratulations to Moderna. But in announcing the findings in news releases, not in peer-reviewed scientific journals, Pfizer and Moderna did not disclose the detailed data that would allow outside experts to evaluate their claims. Therefore, the results cannot be considered conclusive. The figures on effectiveness may change as the studies continue.

The companies' products open the door to an entirely new way of creating vaccines -- and creating them fast. Both use a synthetic version of coronavirus genetic material, called messenger RNA or mRNA, to program a person's cells to churn out many copies of a fragment of the virus. That fragment sets off alarms in the immune system and stimulates it to attack, should the real virus try to invade. Although a number of vaccines using this technology are in development for other infections and cancers, none have yet been approved or marketed.

"The fact that 2 different vaccines made by 2 different companies with 2 different kinds of structures, in a new messenger RNA concept, both worked so effectively confirms the concept once and for all that this is a viable strategy not only for COVID but for future infectious disease threats," said Dr Barry R Bloom, a professor of public health at Harvard. Natalie E Dean, a biostatistician at the University of Florida, said an important finding was that the vaccine appeared to prevent severe disease. Pfizer did not release information about disease severity when reporting its results.

Researchers say the positive results from Pfizer and Moderna bode well for other vaccines because all of the candidates being tested aim at the same target -- the so-called spike protein on the coronavirus that it uses to invade human cells. Dr Bloom said that the success of the 2 vaccines meant that measures of immunity used in earlier phases of the studies -- participants' antibody levels -- were reliable and that other companies could use those measures as proof of effectiveness to shorten the testing and approval process for their vaccines. It will be important to determine whether the vaccines work equally well in older and younger people, experts say. Researchers also want to know if the vaccines prevent people from spreading the virus -- an ideal result that could help quash the pandemic. Another big unknown is how long the immunity provided by the vaccines will last.

An additional concern is that both vaccines must be stored and transported at low temperatures -- minus 4 deg F [-20 deg C] for Moderna, and minus 94 deg F [-70 deg C] for Pfizer -- which could complicate their distribution, particularly to low-income areas in hot climates. Although both vaccines are made of mRNA, their temperature requirements differ because they use different, proprietary formulations of fat to encase and protect the mRNA, Ray Jordan, a Moderna spokesman, said. Other coronavirus vaccines being developed will need only refrigeration. If handled improperly, vaccines can become inactive.

But on Monday [16 Nov 2020], Moderna said researchers had found that its vaccine had a longer shelf life in the refrigerator than previously thought: 30 days, not 7. And it will last 12 hours at room temperature, the company said. Dr William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University, said the relative ease of handling the Moderna vaccine would give it a big advantage. "This vaccine presents the opportunity of using doctors' offices, clinics, and pharmacies as vaccination sites," he said, adding that he would not be surprised, should both vaccines become available, if vaccination sites requested Moderna's.

Moderna's vaccine against COVID-19 is strongly effective, the company said on Monday [16 Nov 2020], building excitement about the potential of controlling the global pandemic. The news comes exactly a week after results from Pfizer and BioNTech, which announced broadly similar results. The Moderna vaccine reduced the risk of COVID-19 infection by 94.5%. There were 95 cases of infection among patients who received placebo in the company's 30 000-patient study. There were only 5 infections in patients who developed COVID-19 after receiving Moderna's vaccine, mRNA-1273.

Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, admitted the preliminary data for the Moderna and the Pfizer vaccines -- the only 2 so far to have early estimates of vaccine efficacy -- are better than he had anticipated. "I'd like to say I would have predicted it, but I would not have," said Fauci, who has often said he would have been satisfied with COVID vaccines that were 70% or 75% efficacy. "Honestly, I would not have expected that. I thought that was too much to hope for," he told STAT.

Moderna also released data about the number of patients who had severe COVID-19. There were 11 cases of severe disease, all of them in the placebo group -- another point of encouragement for Fauci. "There was always the concern ... since the primary endpoint [of the trial] is just clinically apparent disease, how do we know it's going to have an impact on severe disease? And the results with severe disease were striking -- 11 to zero is very impressive," he said. At the time of their data release, Pfizer and BioNTech had no severe cases in their study.

Further, Fauci said the Moderna vaccine appears to have been protective in important subsets of participants -- the elderly and people from racial and ethnic minority groups, the latter of which make up 37% of the Moderna trial population. "It wasn't as if the only people who were protected were the young people. There were people in the elderly, there were people in the minorities," Fauci said. Efficacy was "really consistent across all groups".

The companies said they will file for an emergency use authorization with the Food and Drug Administration in the coming weeks and will file with other global regulators. The European Medicines Agency announced Monday [16 Nov 2020] that it has begun a rolling review of the Moderna vaccine.

Moderna said in its press release that there were no significant safety concerns. Severe events that occurred in greater than 2% of patients included fatigue and muscle pain, which happened in nearly 1 patient in 10, and headache and achiness. These events were "generally short-lived," the company said. "Honestly, I would not have expected that. I thought that was too much to hope for," he told STAT.

[As with last week's announcement (see COVID-19 update (483): vaccine efficacy, Americas region, WHO, global 20201110.7930703) this is promising news, albeit guarded pending release of the full data set. The information on the stability for 30 days if refrigerated and 12 hours at ambient temperature is very promising as distribution through established cold chains (maintaining required temperatures during transportation from production to point of service) would permit a wider distribution of vaccination locations. The absence of severe disease in the vaccinated group was also promising as an outcome of vaccination. We await further information. - Mod.MPP]

[2] CoV-OC43, 1890 Russian flu?
Date: Sun 15 Nov 2020
Source: The NY Times Book review [edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/03/books/review/apollos-arrow-coronavirus-nicholas-christakis.html


In a book review by David Quammen of a new book by Nicholas A Christakis, "Apollo's Arrow: The profound and enduring impact of coronavirus on the way we live," Quammen quotes an intriguing hypothesis raised in the book about the "community associated respiratory" coronavirus OC43:

"The virus called OC43 is a human coronavirus that causes nothing more severe than the common cold. In fact, along with one other coronavirus, it accounts for as much as 30 per cent of all colds. Christakis cites research suggesting that OC43 spilled into people, from cattle, around 1890, which happened to coincide with the beginning of a severe pandemic that was known as the "Russian flu," because its 1st major outbreak occurred in St Petersburg, in December 1889. This "flu" swept out of Russia, across Europe, to the United States, and much of the rest of the world, as fast as trains and ships could carry it, killing about a million people. Was it truly influenza? No one knows, because the concept "virus" hadn't yet been defined, because viruses couldn't be seen through a light microscope and because no modern scientific team has yet found a frozen victim of that 1890 pandemic, awakened a virus, and identified it by genome sequencing.

"There are hints. The lethality of the 1890 bug was low among children and especially high among people over 70. In addition to causing respiratory illness, it sometimes attacked the gastrointestinal tract or produced blazing headaches and body aches, symptoms that Christakis calls less typical of influenza. He suggests that the 1890 event was a pandemic of OC43, a coronavirus passed to humans from some Russian cow. "After being among us for a century, this virus would have further evolved to be a mild pathogen that just causes the common cold today." Routine exposure to OC43 during childhood, he posits, would give a person some acquired immunity."

[I haven't been able to read the book fully, but in brief, Christakis examines the 'Russian' or 'Asiatic' flu pandemic, which appeared to arise in Bukhara, in modern Uzbekistan in 1889 and spread globally causing massive outbreaks in cities including St Petersburg, London, and New York. While speculation of the cause has centered on influenza A H3N8 or H2N2, evidence for CoV-OC43 includes genetic clock data showing that OC43 may have diverged from its bovine counterpart bovine coronavirus (BCoV) around 1890, clinical features of the 1890s illness that differed from influenza such as neurovirulence, its relative sparing of children (unlike influenza), similar case fatality rates to SARS-CoV2 (1200 deaths the 1st week of January 1890 in New York City), and an antecedent outbreak of bovine respiratory illness. In a chapter entitled "How plagues end," Christakis sees a possible evolution to endemicity in SARS-CoV2.

Christakis attributes the hypothesis linking the 'Russian flu' pandemic of 1889-1890 to Leen Vijgen, et al, who described the whole genome sequence of OC43 and noted its likely divergence from BCoV around 1890 as well as the geographically widespread occurrence of cattle pneumonia of unknown cause preceding this.

ref: Vijgen L, Keyaerts E, Moës M, et al. Complete genomic sequence of human coronavirus OC43: molecular clock analysis suggests a relatively recent zoonotic coronavirus transmission event. J Virol. 2005 Feb; 79(3): 1595-1604; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC544107/

It has been possible to detect the H1N1 of 1918 from human remains and a similar approach might detect coronavirus in decedents of the 1890 pandemic. Certainly, the hypothesis is fascinating and plausible. - Mod.LM]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 218. A note of caution re weekend reporting artifact. During the weekend period, some countries do not submit reports to WHO (or elsewhere) or some reporting units within countries do not submit reports so it appears as though transmission may be slowing down when it is reporting that is slowing down.

Data by country, area, or territory for 16 Nov 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesNov16_1605559485.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 43.6% of daily case numbers and 44.1% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, maintaining its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 23.1 million cases. The USA continues to dominate, followed by Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, Canada, and Peru. Other countries/territories reporting more than 1000 cases include Chile and Costa Rica. Countries reporting more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000 in the past 24 hours include Panama, Puerto Rico, Ecuador, and Paraguay.

- The European region reported 40.4% of daily case numbers and 35.8% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 15.2 million. Countries not reporting cases today (16 Nov 2020) include Spain, Israel, Switzerland, Sweden, and Kazakhstan, among others. Countries reporting more than 10 000 cases in the past 24 hours include Italy, France, UK, Russia, Poland, and Germany. Countries reporting 5000-9999 cases include Ukraine, Romania, Hungary, Portugal, Netherlands, and Austria. An additional 12 countries reported between 1000 and 4999 cases.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 6.2% of daily case numbers and 10.9% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 3.57 million cases. Iran is dominant, with continuing record-breaking highs, followed by Morocco, Pakistan, Jordan, Iraq, UAE, Lebanon, and Tunisia. Palestinian Authority, Libya, and Oman, each reported more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000, while Sudan, Somalia, and Yemen did not report any cases in the past 24 hours.

- The African region reported 1.1% of daily case numbers and 1.3% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.40 million cases. South Africa maintains its dominance, followed by Algeria, Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, Nigeria, Mozambique, and Angola. Countries not reporting any new cases include Cameroon, Madagascar, Gabon, Botswana, and Mauritania, among others.

- The Western Pacific region reported 0.87% of daily case numbers and 0.61% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.80 million cases. The Philippines is dominant, followed by Japan, Malaysia, South Korea, Guam, and China. Viet Nam reported 16 cases and Mongolia 12 cases. Viet Nam confirmed 16 cases in returning citizens from Russia. Mongolia has imposed a lockdown for 2 weeks following local transmission after returning truck driver from Russia infected family members (https://www.latestly.com/world/mongolia-imposes-national-lockdown-till-december-1-after-first-covid-19-case-reported-2148275.html and https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20201111-mongolia-reports-first-domestic-coronavirus-transmissions).

- The South East Asia region reported 7.8% of the daily newly reported cases and 7.3% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 10.0 million cases. As previously, India remains dominant, followed by Indonesia, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives. Thailand has reported 9 cases. Thai media report 8 imported cases (https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2019891/thailand-logs-8-new-covid-imports-Sunday).

Impression: There is a continued dominance of Europe and the Americas region with combined reports from these 2 regions representing around 80% of both newly confirmed cases and newly reported deaths in the past 24 hours.

On the Overview tab at the WHO source URL, the epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases by WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 16 Nov 2020, is an excellent visual representation of the pandemic. - Mod.MPP]

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (171 678), Spain (29 291), India (28 555), and Italy (27 352), have been dominant. A global total of 7780 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (15-16 Nov 2020).

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (11 countries) include the USA, Spain, India, Italy, Russia (22 778), UK (21 363), Poland (20 816), Germany (14 582), Brazil (13 647), Iran (13 053), Switzerland (12 839). A total of 53 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 27 of the 53 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 10 are from the Americas region, 7 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 5 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 1 is from the African region. Noteworthy is an increase in global cumulative cases to above 55 million.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 4.7%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 8.8%. Looking at the same comparisons in the USA (which reported 32.1% of all newly reported cases in the past 24 hours), as the dominant country worldwide with clearly uncontrolled transmission, the 7-day change in daily reported cases is 30.6% and in reported deaths is 10.1%. In Italy, the dominant country in the European region, the 7-day change in daily reported cases is 7.3% and in reported deaths is 49.5%. And in Iran, the dominant country in the Eastern Mediterranean region, the 7-day change in daily reported cases is 28.1% and in reported deaths is 6.8%.

Impression: The global daily reported cases continue to increase. This appears to have slowed down with reduced reporting over the weekend although there is an increase today (16 Nov 2020) as the non-reporting countries begin to report. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, followed by the Eastern Mediterranean and the South East Asia regions. The USA continues to show uncontrolled transmission. - Mod.MPP]
