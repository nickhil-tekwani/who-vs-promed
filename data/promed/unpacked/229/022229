[4] Physician questions
Date: Thu 14 Jul 2022
Source: American Medical Association (AMA) [edited]
https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/public-health/monkeypox-physician-frequently-asked-questions


Clinical questions
------------------
1. What should prompt clinical suspicion for monkeypox infection?

Clinicians should be alert to patients presenting with a new characteristic rash or if the patient meets one of the epidemiologic criteria and there is a high clinical suspicion for monkeypox. The cases of monkeypox described in the current outbreak have some atypical features. The rash may start in the genital and perianal areas, the rash may not always disseminate to other parts of the body and typical prodromal symptoms may be mild or absent. These features of the newest monkeypox cases can easily be confused with sexually transmitted infections, including herpes, syphilis and varicella.

2. What should I do if I suspect a patient has monkeypox?

Clinicians should first isolate their patient in a single person room if available and immediately consult their public health department or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) through the Emergency Operations Center (770-488-7100) as soon as monkeypox is suspected. Prompt notification is important to facilitate testing, exposure risk assessments for close contacts as well as consideration of available medications and vaccination.

3. How do I access testing for monkeypox?

While testing was initially only available through public health labs, CDC has shipped tests to the 5 major commercial laboratories. LabCorp, Quest Diagnostics, Aegis Science, Mayo Clinic Labs and Sonic Healthcare will begin offering testing soon, which should make testing easier to order and less burdensome for physicians and patients. Testing is currently available through the following labs:

- Laboratory Response Network (LRN) laboratories. To initiate testing through LRN laboratories, please contact your public health department.
- Labcorp is now offering monkeypox testing at its largest facility in the United States and expects to be able to perform up to 10 000 tests per week. Healthcare providers can order the orthopoxvirus test from Labcorp just as they normally would order other tests.
- Mayo Clinic Laboratories can now test for monkeypox. Mayo Clinic Laboratories will offer testing at its Mayo Clinic's Division of Clinical Microbiology laboratories in Rochester, Minnesota, and can accept specimens from anywhere in the country. Mayo Clinic Laboratories expects to be able to perform up to 10 000 tests per week.

For initial laboratory testing of monkeypox virus specimens, the recommended specimen type is skin lesion material. Specifics on the acceptable specimen type accepted within these laboratories may vary. Please contact the appropriate public health department or commercial laboratory to determine acceptable specimens.

CDC has asked commercial labs to send positive samples to CDC for viral characterization testing, but healthcare professionals can act on positive results from commercial labs before CDC performs testing.

4. Which vaccines are available for monkeypox?

JYNNEOS (also known as Imvamune or Imvanex) and ACAM2000 are the 2 currently licensed vaccines in the United States to prevent smallpox. JYNNEOS is also licensed specifically to prevent monkeypox. Both JYNNEOS and ACAM2000 can be used before and after exposure to monkeypox in an outbreak setting.

However, ACAM2000 carries greater risk of certain serious side effects and should not be given to some people, including people with weakened immune systems, certain skin conditions such as eczema, heart disease or who are pregnant or lactating.

5. Who is eligible for vaccination in the United States?

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends vaccination for those at high risk following a confirmed monkeypox exposure.

The 2-dose JYNNEOS vaccine is being allocated to jurisdictions for use for the following individuals:

- Known contacts who are identified by public health via case investigation, contact tracing and risk exposure assessments
- Presumed contacts who may meet the following criteria: (1) Know that a sexual partner in the past 14 days was diagnosed with monkeypox or (2) Had multiple sexual partners in the past 14 days in a jurisdiction with known monkeypox
- JYNNEOS doses should be prioritized for those people who are at risk for severe adverse events with ACAM2000 or severe disease from monkeypox (such as people with HIV or other immunocompromising conditions)
- To supplement the supply of JYNNEOS, states, tribal nations and territories may also request ACAM2000.

CDC recommends that the vaccine be given within 4 days from the date of exposure to prevent onset of the disease. If given between 4-14 days after the date of exposure, vaccination may reduce the symptoms of disease but may not prevent the disease.

6. How can patients get access to vaccines for monkeypox?

On 28 Jun 2022, US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced an enhanced vaccination strategy to protect at-risk individuals from monkeypox. The federal government is partnering with state, tribal, local and territorial governments in deploying the vaccines. JYNNEOS vaccine will be allocated using a distribution strategy that prioritizes jurisdictions with the highest case rates of monkeypox.

Doses of JYNNEOS will be allocated to health departments based on the number of individuals at risk for monkeypox who also have pre-existing conditions, like HIV. For more information on accessing vaccine in their jurisdiction, physicians should contact their public health department.

7. What treatments are available for monkeypox?

There is no treatment specifically for monkeypox, but because the monkeypox and smallpox viruses are closely related, drugs and vaccines developed to protect against smallpox may be used to prevent and treat monkeypox virus infections.

Treatment will depend on how sick someone gets or whether they are likely to get severely ill. Most people with monkeypox recover fully within 2 to 4 weeks without the need for treatment. The antiviral drug tecovirimat (also known as TPOXX) was developed to fight smallpox, but the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allows CDC to use it to treat monkeypox during an outbreak. In addition, other drugs may be useful against monkeypox, but have not yet been tested:

- Vaccinia Immune Globulin Intravenous (VIGIV) is licensed by FDA for treating complications from smallpox vaccination. CDC has permission to use of VIGIV for the treatment of orthopoxviruses, including monkeypox, during an outbreak.
- Cidofovir (also known as Vistide) is an antiviral medication approved by the FDA for the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in patients with AIDS.
- Brincidofovir (also known as Tembexa) is an antiviral medication that was approved by the FDA in 2021 for the treatment of human smallpox disease.

Find more information from the CDC.

8. How do I get access to antivirals to treat patients with monkeypox?

Antiviral drugs used to treat smallpox and monkeypox require a prescription and must be released from the US Strategic National Stockpile at the request of a patient's local or state health department. If antivirals are needed, or additional information is required, physicians should contact their public health department or the CDC Emergency Operations Center at 770-488-7100, Monday through Friday, 8 am to 4:30 pm EST; at other times, call 404-639-2888 and request a clinical consult.

Infection prevention and control questions
------------------------------------------
1. What infection control precautions should be taken when evaluating a patient with suspected monkeypox?

Clinicians should use standard and recommended isolation precautions and notify infection prevention and control personnel immediately when caring for patients with suspected or confirmed monkeypox infection. The patient should be placed in a single-person room; special air handling is not required. PPE used by healthcare professionals who enter the patient's room should include gown, gloves, eye protection and NIOSH-approved particulate respirator equipped with N95 filters or higher.

Clinicians and patients in healthcare facilities who have had an exposure to monkeypox should be monitored and receive post-exposure management according to current recommendations.

[5] Virus in saliva and semen
Date: Thu 14 Jul 2022

Citation: Peiró-Mestres A, Fuertes I, Camprubí-Ferrer D, et al, on behalf of the Hospital Clinic de Barcelona Monkeypox Study Group. Frequent detection of monkeypox virus DNA in saliva, semen, and other clinical samples from 12 patients, Barcelona, Spain, May to June 2022. Euro Surveill. 2022; 27(28): pii=2200503.

Abstract
--------
A monkeypox (MPX) outbreak has expanded worldwide since May 2022. We tested 147 clinical samples collected at different time points from 12 patients by real-time PCR. MPX DNA was detected in saliva from all cases, sometimes with high viral loads. Other samples were frequently positive: rectal swab (11 of 12 cases), nasopharyngeal swab (10 of 12 cases), semen (7 of 9 cases), urine (9 of 12 cases) and faeces (8 of 12 cases). These results improve knowledge on virus shedding and the possible role of bodily fluids in disease transmission.

Discussion
----------
In this study, we provide data on 147 clinical samples, collected at 23 time points from 12 confirmed MPX cases in Barcelona. Our knowledge on MPX virus shedding is clearly limited, but greatly needed in the current epidemiological situation, where many countries are experiencing an upsurge of cases. To our knowledge, a single report (3 [see source URL for complete references]) has been published on this issue, reporting results on 24 samples from 4 cases and detected MPX DNA in semen (3 patients), blood (one patient), nasopharyngeal swab (3 patients), faeces (2 patients) and saliva (one patient). In addition, a study from Germany detected MPX virus in blood and semen of 2 cases. In the current outbreak, several clinical and epidemiological data support that close contact often in the context of sexual activity is driving disease transmission. Thus, a detailed description of the presence of the virus in bodily fluids may shed light on the mechanisms of viral transmission.

Our results on saliva samples are of special interest. In a previous report, saliva was only tested once in a single patient. Here, we find that MPX DNA was detected in saliva at some point in all 12 patients studied, in the samples collected between 4-16 days after the onset of symptoms. The other clinical samples analysed, including semen, frequently contained MPX virus DNA. We did not perform cell culture, and a clear correlation between real-time PCR and virus isolation has not been reported in existing literature. However, results from studies in animal samples that quantified MPX virus and performed cell culture indicate that virus isolation can be successful with viral loads in the range of 10exp4 to 10exp5 copies/mL. Furthermore, during the present outbreak, MPX virus has been isolated from skin lesion samples with a Cq of 20 in one case. With the low Cq values observed in our study in a variety of samples such as saliva, rectal swab, semen, urine and faecal samples, further research on the infectious potential of these bodily fluids and their potential role in disease transmission by close physical contact during sexual activity is warranted.

Conclusions
-----------
MPX virus transmission dynamics, similarly to other newly emerging viral infections, may need to be addressed under multidisciplinary approaches. Our results contribute to an improved understanding of a likely complex transmission puzzle and underline other immediate areas for research such as the infectivity of bodily fluids, the frequency of secondary and asymptomatic cases or the impact of social and behavioural factors affecting viral transmission. Our results may be valuable as well for diagnostic testing algorithms and public health interventions.

[6] Spread and response
Date: Wed 13 Jul 2022
Source: Axios [abridged, edited]
https://www.axios.com/2022/07/14/monkeypox-vaccine-treatment-fauci-cdc


The federal and state response to the escalating monkeypox outbreak is lacking access to enough vaccines, testing and treatments to keep up with the virus' spread, infectious disease experts are warning.

Why it matters: Public health officials are racing to halt the spread before the disease becomes endemic in more countries. Cases are rising quickly -- New York City, for example, has seen a tripling in patients over the past week.

The big picture: Some experts say this outbreak echoes the start of the HIV epidemic that also first appeared in communities of men who have sex with men (MSM), but NIAID director Anthony Fauci says there are "fundamental differences" from that traumatic time when there was an unknown agent killing patients rapidly.

- While this outbreak of monkeypox outside endemic countries is "unprecedented" in its rate of human-to-human spread, the virus for monkeypox has been identified, isn't nearly as deadly, and there are potential vaccines and treatments already in existence, Fauci tells Axios.
- "The challenge, now, is to obviously get a handle on the extent of this and the spread of this, and you do that by testing," Fauci says.
- "The other challenge is to implement the countermeasures we already have. Like getting the vaccines to the people at risk and to make sure that we mobilize the vaccines we contracted to be made years ago," he adds.

The latest: The CDC has now partnered with 5 commercial firms to make testing more widely available, but there's concern it hasn't reacted quickly enough.

- The FDA approved in 2019 the Jynneos vaccine for adults at high risk of monkeypox to Bavarian Nordic A/S, but there are not enough doses to distribute, Foote says. CDC press officer Scott Pauley says the CDC and HHS have delivered more than 41 000 doses of the vaccines as of 7 Jul 2022.
- While there's an effective antiviral treatment called TPOXX, which is FDA-approved for smallpox, it's only available for use in certain monkeypox patients via an onerous 120-page protocol for expanded access to investigational new drugs, which is a big barrier to access, Foote says. (FDA declined to "confirm, deny or comment" to Axios on "potential/pending applications.")

"We're worried that this could become a treatment only accessible by patients with privilege or who are very savvy at navigating a very complicated system," Foote says.

- "This is a call to action" that is hampered by the lack of a federal health care system, Lilian Abbo, professor of clinical infectious diseases at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, tells the IDSA briefing.

Between the lines: This strain has been affecting patients in unusual ways that include higher person-to-person transmission that sometimes leaves permanent damage, but a lower death rate than in endemic countries, Foote says.

- "A lot of people with this infection are really suffering, and some actually may be at risk for permanent damage and scarring. We've seen many people with symptoms that are so severe, that they are unable to go to the bathroom, urinate or eat without excruciating pain."
- Julie Swann, a public health researcher and professor at NC State University, tells Axios that researchers are looking into whether higher rates of syphilis in the MSM communities may play a role in the greater spread of monkeypox.

The CDC updated its guidance this week to warn everyone to take steps against infection, as "anyone who has been in close contact with someone who has monkeypox can get the illness," Pauley tells Axios.

- They are urging everyone to "use appropriate infection prevention and control measures."
- The virus is "not known to linger in the air and is not transmitted during short periods of shared airspace" although it can spread through respiratory secretions when people have close face-to-face contact.
- Monkeypox mainly spreads through direct contact with an infected person's body fluids or sores, or with direct contact with materials that have touched body fluids or sores, such as clothing or linens.
- "We continue to study other possible modes of transmission, such as through semen," Pauley added.

What's next: The WHO is expected to hold a meeting next week to determine if monkeypox should be declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), its highest alert.

[7] Outbreak avoidable
Date: Wed 13 Jul 2022 11:19 EDT
Source: People [edited]
https://people.com/health/expert-says-monkeypox-outbreak-was-avoidable-virus-was-potential-problem-for-decades/


As monkeypox cases rise across the country and worldwide, experts who have studied the virus are criticizing the response from health officials, claiming the current global outbreak was avoidable. Dr. Anne Rimoin, UCLA epidemiology professor who spent 2 decades in the Democratic Republic of Congo studying monkeypox, spoke to National Public Radio (NPR) and detailed the missteps from world leaders, stating there was only a global response to monkeypox when it spread beyond Africa.

"This virus has been spreading in marginalized and vulnerable populations [in Africa] for decades, and we've done nothing about it," Rimoin told the outlet. "We have known that monkeypox is a potential problem for decades."

There are currently 9200 confirmed monkeypox cases across 63 countries, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). As of Tuesday [12 Jul 2022], there are 929 confirmed monkeypox cases in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) 2022 Monkeypox Outbreak Global Map. However, Rimoin said there is likely an undercount due to a lack of testing.

The virus is named monkeypox because it was first identified in 1958 in colonies of monkeys. The 1st human case of the virus was found in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, according to the CDC.

Cases have mostly been concentrated in the Congo -- which typically sees thousands of monkeypox infections a year -- and Nigeria, where there have been more than 200 suspected and 500 reported cases since 2017, according to WHO. In the Congo, around one in 10 people who contract monkeypox die, but that is not the case in the United States, where no one has ever died due to the virus.

Rimoin said there should have been more efforts to address the virus in rural Africa earlier on due to possibilities it could easily spread through travel. "If we do want to get in front of emerging infectious diseases, we are going to have to prioritize dealing with emerging global disease threats at the site where they are spreading early on," Rimoin said, per NPR. "We are totally interconnected by trade and travel, population growth, population movement, and we cannot make the mistake again of thinking that an infection that's happening somewhere in a remote area of the world isn't going to affect us right at home."

"We will continue to be chasing behind them, and always be paying the price for not doing what's needed ahead of time," she added. "The good news is we have vaccines, we have therapeutics, we know a fair amount about this virus. The bad news is now we have to get the logistics together to be able to confront it head on."

Monkeypox first causes fever, headache, muscle aches, chills and swollen lymph nodes, and after one to 3 days patients develop a rash that spreads over the body and turns into fluid-filled lesions. The rare virus can spread through respiratory droplets, but is most likely to transmit from touching body fluids or the rashes.

Last month [June 2022], the Department of Health and Human Services (HSS) announced vaccinations will now be available to anyone with presumed exposure to the virus, in addition to individuals with known exposure who were already being offered immunizations.

HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra said the department will release 56 000 doses of the Jynneos vaccine immediately, with an additional 240 000 doses being made available in the coming weeks. In total, 1.6 million doses of the vaccine are expected by the end of the year [2022].

[Ironically, vaccine may not always be available. A 13 Jul 2022 report stated that New York City's monkeypox vaccine appointment website crashed on Tuesday (12 Jul 2022) "due to overwhelming traffic," the city announced as the nation sees an uptick in cases. "All available monkeypox vaccine appointment slots have been booked" (https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/3557335-monkeypox-vaccine-appointment-website-crashes-in-new-york-city/). - Mod.TY]
