One more case of sylvan yellow fever (YF) has been confirmed in a 15-year-old
boy in the Federal District [Brasilia. The patient lives in Brazlandia, 60
km from Brasilia, but according to the State Secretariat of Health he became
infected in Arraias (Tocantins State). This is the second confirmed case from
that State, and the 9th to be confirmed in Brasilia.
This was one of the cases that had been declared not confirmed on 25 Jan 2000.
His first test was negative, but as severe symptoms continued he was retested
and showed positive.
There have been 3 more cases confirmed from Goias State last week, which
with this one from Tocantins makes 14 cases of YF confirmed in Brazil so
far this year [2000, with 2 deaths. This is 4 more than the 10 reported
by Funasa [the National Health Foundation in its last report of 27 Jan
2000.

[Sylvan YF is the form transmitted in rural surroundings by forest
mosquitoes, not _Aedes aegypti_ which prefers towns. We hope all these
cases, both suspected & confirmed, have been reported within 24 hours to
WHO Geneva, as required by the IHR (International Health Regulations).
Travellers to & within Brazil should get vaccinated against YF 10 days
beforehand; YF vaccinations are free to all in Brazil. - Mod.JW
