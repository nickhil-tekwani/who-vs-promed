Abstract

Yellow fever virus remains a major threat in low resource countries in South America and Africa despite the existence of an effective vaccine. In Senegal and particularly in the eastern part of the country, periodic sylvatic circulation has been demonstrated with varying degrees of impact on populations in perpetual renewal. We report an outbreak that occurred from October 2020 to February 2021 in eastern Senegal, notified and managed through the synergistic effort yellow fever national surveillance implemented by the Senegalese Ministry of Health in collaboration with the World Health Organization, the countrywide 4S network set up by the Ministry of Health, the Institut Pasteur de Dakar, and the surveillance of arboviruses and hemorrhagic fever viruses in human and vector populations implemented since mid 2020 in eastern Senegal. Virological analyses highlighted the implication of sylvatic mosquito species in virus transmission. Genomic analysis showed a close relationship between the circulating strain in eastern Senegal, 2020, and another one from the West African lineage previously detected and sequenced 2 years ago [2019] from an unvaccinated Dutch traveler who visited the Gambia and Senegal before developing signs after returning to Europe. Moreover, genome analysis identified a 6-nucleotide deletion in the variable domain of the 3â€²UTR with potential impact on the biology of the viral strain that merits further investigations. Integrated surveillance of yellow fever virus but also of other arboviruses of public health interest is crucial in an ecosystem such as eastern Senegal.

[Yellow fever (YF) outbreaks have occurred sporadically in Senegal. Senegal is considered a high priority country by the Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemics (EYE) strategy. The WHO reported that from October to December 2020, a total of 7 confirmed cases of yellow fever (YF) were reported from 4 health districts in 3 regions in Senegal. The outbreak consists of a cluster of 4 confirmed cases from 3 health zones in Kidira health district, Tambacounda region; one case in the neighbouring Kedougou health district, Kedougou region; one case in Saraya health district, Kedougou region; and one case in Thilogne health district, Matam region (see Yellow fever - Africa (26): Nigeria, Senegal, WHO 20201231.8059011). The occurrence of cases in diverse geographic areas -- 4 health districts in 3 regions in Senegal -- underscore the importance of maintaining a high level of vaccination coverage over a wide area. There is an ongoing risk of spillover from sylvan (forest) or transitional (savannah) transmission cycles with the possibility of introduction of the virus into urban settings where the vector mosquito is present, leading to ongoing outbreak transmission. Surveillance is important to detect cases with prompt laboratory response to confirm YF. Contingency plans must be in place to accomplish rapid response by health authorities to implement vaccination and vector control efforts. As the above report mentions, this can be difficult in areas with poor access, especially during the rainy season when roads may become impassable. - Mod.TY
