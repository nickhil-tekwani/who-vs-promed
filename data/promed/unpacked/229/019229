The 1st case of yellow fever this year [2009] was recorded in Paraguay in a
man who appears to have been infected in northern Argentina, authorities said.

This report is of a 45 year old man who resided in Bella Vista, 350 km (217
miles) south of Asuncion, near the border with Argentina. According to
authorities, he had traveled recently to Posadas, capital of Argentina's
Misiones province, in the border area with Brazil, where he appeared to
have become infected.

The said Argentine province is one of the places where the [virus] disease
affected 2 people. [ProMED-mail archive no. 20090115.0168, posted on 15 Jan
2009, for the report of those 2 cases in Misiones province plus an
additional suspected case there. - Mod.TY]

The Paraguay Minister of Health has declared a health alert in the area
where the case occurred.

[The declaration of a health alert by the Paraguay Minister of health is
prudent, as there is a risk of ongoing transmission should the introduced
YF virus be acquired by _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes and an urban cycle of
the virus be initiated, as it was last year (2008) near Asuncion, the
capital city of Paraguay. One hopes that the massive YF virus vaccination
campaign carried out in Paraguay last year (2008) has rendered the vast
majority of the population in the country immune to YF virus infection.

Misiones province, where the infection was presumably acquired, can be
