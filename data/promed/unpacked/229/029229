Two people have died and 26 others hospitalised following cholera outbreak in Embu County. County Director of Health Stephen Kaniaru on Monday said the 2 died in Siakago and Runyenjes Level Four hospitals. He noted that the patients had developed severe diarrhoea and vomiting.

Mr. Kaniaru added that a KCPE (secondary education testing) candidate, who was among those admitted to various hospitals, had been discharged and was fit to sit the examination. Also among the sick is a 2-year-old girl, a 6-year-old boy from Majimbo and a 7-year-old boy from Dallas. Speaking in his office, Dr Kaniaru said 12 patients were recovering at Embu Level Five Hospital and others at Kiritiri, Runyenjes and Siakago Level Four hospitals.

He said health officials had identified the cause of the disease as contaminated water and had sent samples from Thiba, Ena, Rupingazi, Kapingazi and Muchina water project to Water Resources Management Authority (Warma) and government chemist for testing. Dr Kaniaru said most cases had been reported at Maranga, Ngeniari, Thagaiya, Mufu, Kangondi and Ndumari villages in Runyenjes.

In Mbeere South, cases had been detected in Kamurugu and Kirima villages. Other areas include Dallas, Grogon, Don Bosco and Majimbo in Embu West while in Mbeere North, cases had been reported in Kaungu, Riandu and BAT areas.

"We believe the cholera outbreak has been triggered by consumption of contaminated water. Those interviewed suggest they drank contaminated water" Dr Kaniaru said. He said doctors will tour various villages where the patients come from to establish their sources of water and examine the general hygiene.

Dr Kaniaru said the county government had banned food hawking and feasting in ceremonies such as weddings and funerals as health officials try to control the situation. He urged residents to avoid eating food from streets. He also assured residents that they situation would be contained. On [Sun 29 Oct 2017], 21 people were admitted to various hospitals in the county they exhibited cholera symptoms.

County Health Executive Jamleck Muturi said the disease was first detected in Grogon slums in Manyatta and Kanduri village in Runyenjes. He said other cases were later detected in Mbeere South. One of the patients is from Murinduko in the neighbouring Kirinyaga County. The executive said 8 patients were discharged[Mon 30 Oct 2017] evening. "Starting today, we will deploy health officials to check on the hygiene status of hotels and those found unhygienic will be closed," the official said.

[2] Cholera - Congo DR

Severe cholera epidemic: MSF treats more than 18,000 patients
-------------------------------------------------------------
Cholera is widespread in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. MSF has already treated more than 18 000 patients in 2017, with 38 000 registered nationwide. It is expected that it will take many weeks to contain the epidemic. While in some parts of the country the number of patients is declining or consistent, this time cholera also occurs in cities where no cases of illness have ever been registered. The ongoing spread of cholera in 21 out of 26 provinces is unprecedented in the history of the country.

"One of the main reasons why cholera cases have risen so much this year [2017] is the drought," said Francisco Otero, MSF Country Coordinator in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. "The wells have dried up or the water level has been so low that many people have been forced to take water from unsafe sources such as lakes or rivers. The authorities are not in a position to provide the population with clean drinking water."

This time, densely populated cities are affected. Goma, the capital of North Kivu, also on Kivu Lake, is affected as well as the cities of Minova and Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu. In all these cities MSF teams treat cholera patients.

Terribly, cholera in many cases affects infants, but over the past few days older children have been increasingly brought to treatment centers. "We believe that starting school has contributed to the spread of cholera," said Innocent Kunywana, MSF operations officer in South Kivu.

Another reason for the spread of cholera is insufficient preventive measures and insufficient information of the population. Cholera is endemic in several provinces of the Congo DR, and sporadic outbreaks are common. However, health care workers sometimes do not know how to treat cholera properly. "We've found hospitals where cholera patients are shared with patients with other illnesses," says Kunywana. "Therefore, the risk of infection for relatives and other patients was very high."

"According to the Ministry of Health regulations, the treatment of cholera should be free of charge," adds Otero. "But sometimes the hospitals are not equipped for it. You have to buy the materials and medicines yourself and somehow recover the costs. That's why they often charge them to the patient."

Although the population of the 2 provinces of North and South Kivu is suffering from a conflict that has been going on for more than 20 years, there are fewer and fewer NGOs and international relief agencies that can respond to medical emergencies like the cholera outbreak, especially in South Kivu , "We saw that during the measles epidemic this year [2017], we see it as helping the displaced, and now it shows again during the cholera epidemic," says Otero. "Such outbursts will repeat and worsen if nothing changes. The United Nations has ranked the highest level of humanitarian emergency in the province. We'll see if that translates into local help."

Chad: Cholera Outbreak - Emergency Plan of Action
-------------------------------------------------
Following the declaration of the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) about cholera epidemics in the village of Maréna, Koukou Angarana subprefecture, the Red Cross of Chad (RCC) Sila regional committee, informed by the national headquarters, carried out an evaluation mission from [21 to 22 Aug ] in Maréna, Tyéro and Dogdoré villages, where the epidemic seems to have started on [14 Aug 2017].

The epidemic spread on [11 Sep 2017] to the Salamat region, more specifically in the village of Amdjoudoul, Mouraye sub-prefecture in the Salamat region, a locality bordering the region of Sila. The Salamat Regional Committee of the RCC after holding the national headquarters at the disposal of the Regional Health Delegation (RSD) of Salamat a large number of volunteers in the framework of sensitization on the RSD. The Ministry of Health officially announced the cholera epidemic in this region.

For the 2 regions of Salamat and Sila 652 cases of cholera are recorded 59 including the beginning of the epidemic. However, for the region of Sila, the situation seems to be under control. In Salamat, from [11 Sep 2017] to [11 Oct 2017] (epi-week 41) in total 277 cases of cholera were confirmed with 11 deaths with a case fatality rate of 4percent.

[5] Cholera - Sudan
Date: Mon 30 Oct 2017

http://allafrica.com/stories/201710310306.html


Following more than a year of intensive efforts by the Sudanese Ministry of Health, the World Health Organization (WHO), the UN Children's Agency (UNICEF), and other health partners managed to mitigate the outbreak of Acute Watery Diarrhoea (AWD), the number of cases in the country dropped significantly during the past weeks. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Sudan reports in its latest bulletin that to stop the spread of AWD completely, the response must continue until no cases are reported in the country for 3 consecutive weeks.

Only 78 new cases and 2 related deaths were reported between [8 and 14 Oct 2017], down from a peak of nearly 2000 new cases at the end of June 2017. A total of 8 states reported active case transmissions and the only state reporting 2 AWD-related deaths was South Kordofan. The Health Ministry continued to lead an active scale-up of interventions to ensure a final stop to the spread of AWD.

One key measure -which the Health Ministry is considering to end the current outbreak- is a renewed Oral Cholera Vaccine (OCV) campaign. The Ministry, in consultation with WHO and other stakeholders, has decided to explore the need and possibility of introducing OCV in the high-risk states in Sudan, namely White Nile, Kassala, West and South Darfur, and South Kordofan, the OCHA bulletin reads.

Risk assessments are currently ongoing in these states to determine target areas and groups. Teams are investigating success factors such as accessibility and availability of health services, disease surveillance capacity, water, sanitation and hygiene, capacity to implement mass vaccination campaigns, cold-chain capacity at central and field levels, and monitoring and evaluation.

The possible OCV campaign, paired with ongoing and intensified activities in WHO's 6 other key response areas (health capacity building, AWD case management, provision of key medicine and medical supplies, water quality control, vector control, and hygiene promotion), are hoped to stop the AWD outbreak in Sudan.

In spite of numerous independent confirmations (conducted according to WHO standards) that the disease which broke out in Blue Nile state in August 2016 turned out to be cholera, the Government of Sudan and several international organizations still refuse to refer to it by this name.

[The mortality from cholera and most diarrheal illnesses is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.

As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 percent to 3.6 percent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
