[The previous BT event in Montenegro was also associated with serotype BTV-4. That event was resolved on 30 May 2015. See event summary report and map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=16351.

Montenegro borders Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Kosovo, and Albania. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montenegro#Geography_and_environment. On 29 Aug 2016, Bosnia and Herzegovina also reported Bluetongue, (see posting 20160830.4450348). Although the serotype is still pending, given the confirmation of BTV4 in the Montenegro, that detection is also likely to be BTV4. - Mod.CRD
