Police in Sussex say the sausages, which had been sliced open and filled with the blue pellets, were found on the Cuckoo Trail in Hailsham.

Police have issued a warning to dog owners after cocktail sausages believed to be stuffed with toxic slug pellets were found at a popular walking spot. Police in Hailsham, Sussex, have told dog walkers to be cautious after the contaminated meat was discovered by a member of the public.

The sausages were found on the Cuckoo Trail in Hailsham on Tuesday evening [8 Apr 2015].

An RSPCA spokesman said: "The RSPCA is deeply concerned about any spate of suspected poisonings, but especially one where evidence suggests it may be deliberate. Animals, and especially dogs, are often extremely curious and will be drawn to food. Ingesting just the smallest amounts of some substances can lead to kidney failure and death. [This statement suggests that the toxic blue pellets have been identified. Or alternatively this is more than a warning, as there are already deceased pets. - Mod.TG]

"If anyone suspects that their dog has been poisoned they must take it to a vet immediately. If possible, they should take a sample of what the dog has eaten."

The issue of dog poisoning was highlighted last month [March 2015] when the Irish setter Jagger died after competing at Crufts. It was initially thought he had been poisoned at the event, but toxicology results revealed the dog had eaten what is believed to be contaminated beef in Belgium.

Poisoning is a criminal offence in the UK under the Animal Welfare Act of 2006. The maximum penalty for those found guilty is up to 6 months imprisonment and/or a fine of up to GBP 20 000 [USD 29 309].

Anyone with evidence to support allegations that someone is deliberately trying to poison dogs is asked to contact the RSPCA's national cruelty line on 0300 1234 999.

[Unfortunately, it is not uncommon that malicious people stuff treats (meat bait) with some type of toxic substance. The pellets in the photo on both of these web sites may be a rodenticide -- except that most rodenticides do not cause kidney failure. Therefore, that statement means there are deceased animals, or they would not know it causes kidney failure. In which case perhaps these are pellets of melamine/cyanouric acid, which does have that effect. - Mod.TG
