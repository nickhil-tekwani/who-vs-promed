Dangerous outbreak of stem rust in southern Ethiopia
----------------------------------------------------
Farmers are on alert [see ProMED-mail post 20140109.2162758] after stem rust decimated more than 10 000 hectares [24 711 acres] of wheat in southern Ethiopia.

[It has now been] revealed that the strain of stem rust is possibly similar to a strain found in Turkey since 2007, and in Egypt and Germany in 2013. The pathogen did not have a noticeable impact on production in these areas, but in Ethiopia, the strain was lethal to popular variety Digalu.

According to David Hodson, CIMMYT [International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre], the previous lack of damage could mean that wheat varieties there are resistant, there were slight differences in the strains, or that environmental conditions have not been conducive. He said experts were surprised to see stem rust of any type in Germany, where the pathogen has not been detected for decades.

The researchers noted that the stem rust in Ethiopia is not a Ug99 strain. Digalu [is] resistant to both yellow rust and the Ug99 strains.

Wind models indicate the [strain] also could spread towards Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda, and the Middle East. Efforts are underway to identify varieties that might be susceptible to the strain causing problems in Ethiopia. Agriculture officials are advising farmers how to use fungicides to control an outbreak.

[Wheat stem rust is caused by the fungus _Puccinia graminis_ f. sp. _tritici_. Overall yield losses of up to 80 percent are reported, but some fields are totally destroyed. Stem rust spores are spread by wind and with infected straw. Some grasses or volunteer wheat may generate a "green bridge" providing inoculum for the next cropping season. Disease management may include fungicide applications, control of volunteer wheat, and resistant varieties if available.

New races are emerging, including Ug99 group strains, which have overcome the major resistance gene Sr31 used in current wheat varieties. Ug99 strains are known to be present in Ethiopia, but Ug99 resistant wheat varieties have been introduced in the country.

The strain identified now in Ethiopia appears new to the country. It has confirmed virulence on resistance genes Sr5, 21, 9e, 7b, 6, 8a, 9g, 36, 9b, 30, 17, 9a, 9d, 10, Tmp, McN, but is avirulent on Sr11, 24, 31 (see link below). It is not clear whether it is a recent incursion or a local mutation. Its relationship to the other strains from Europe mentioned above will need to be clarified, and results may indicate a possible source of the outbreak.
