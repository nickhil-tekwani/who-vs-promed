According to several Japanese newspapers, six workers and customers at an
Italian restaurant in Tokyo were found to have botulism on August 15, 1998.
Their signs and symptoms include difficulty in swallowing, drooping
eyelids, and nausea. A 64-year old lady was hospitalized and still in a
serious condition. The product in question is "Green Olives Bella di
Cerignola," a large glass bottle containing 2.7 kilograms of
salty water and olives.

The Tokyo metropolitan government urged the public to be on the alert for
jars of olives tainted with the [botulinum] toxin after five people became
ill after eating the fruit at a party last month.
Officials of the metropolitan government's Public Health Bureau said the
fit-for-consumption expiry date on the 2,700-gram jars, which were labeled
Green Olives Bella di Cerignola, was December 2001.
After eating the olives at a party in a restaurant on July 24, five people
complained of difficulty in swallowing and blurred vision - typical
symptoms of botulism. One victim, a 64-year-old woman, was hospitalized,
the officials said.
A public health center analyzed food at the party and discovered
botulinum-B toxin in the olives and their preservative. The bureau then
launched a full-fledged investigation to determine how many jars had been
sold and the distribution routes.
Because of the possibility the olives may have been widely distributed, the
bureau warned major supermarkets to remove them from their shelves.
