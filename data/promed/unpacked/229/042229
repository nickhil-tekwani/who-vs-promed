Avian Influenza in the United States of America in a commercial poultry
enterprise
------------------------
Emergency report
Information received on 11 Mar 2003 from Dr Peter Fernandez, Associate
Administrator, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA), Washington, DC:
Report date: 11 Mar 2003.
Nature of diagnosis: clinical and laboratory.
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: mid-January 2003.
Outbreaks:
Location: New London County, State of Connecticut
No. of outbreaks: two commercial operations managed by the same enterprise
Description of affected population: table-egg layer hens.
Total number of animals in the outbreak:
species / susceptible / cases / deaths / destroyed / slaughtered
avi / approx. 2 300 000 / ... / ... / 0 / 0
Diagnosis:
- The detection was made in a commercial layer operation consisting of
about 1.3 million hens. The poultry were showing respiratory signs and a
drop in egg production. Tissue sample results from this flock were positive
for avian influenza subtype H7 on PCR(1) testing, and virus was isolated
from passage in fertile eggs.
- A second flock owned by the same enterprise has evidence of exposure as
determined by serology; however, no virus has been isolated.
A. Laboratory where diagnosis was made: National Veterinary Services
Laboratories, Ames, Iowa.
B. Diagnostic tests used: serology, virus isolation, PCR, DNA sequencing.
C. Causal agent: the virus subtype is H7N2, and has been determined to be
of low pathogenicity by virus sequencing.
Epidemiology:
A. Source of agent / origin of infection: unknown at this time, but the
virus isolate seems to be the same one as that known to circulate
occasionally in live bird markets in the New York City area.
B. Mode of spread: direct contact, fomites.
Control measures: quarantine and movement control inside the country.
USDA-APHIS is working closely with the State of Connecticut conducting
epidemiological investigations, tracebacks, and area surveillance testing.
(1) PCR: polymerase chain reaction.
