A suspected outbreak of a parasitic disease at a Teesside pet centre has left 3 workers needing hospital treatment. Two people have been discharged, but one woman is still recovering in hospital.

Staff became unwell last week [week ending 8 Apr 2018] after treating sick lambs in an isolation unit at Pet Mania on Portrack Lane, Stockton. The cause of the illness is thought to be the parasite _Cryptosporidium_, which can lead to symptoms such as diarrhoea, fever and vomiting.

The pet shop, known for its array of exotic animals, remains open after management said there was "no risk to the public". Business development manager William Smith said: "There have been 3 members of the team who have been in hospital. They became ill after looking after some lambs that were unwell. Most have been in for a day and were OK after. They are now out. Only one person is still in hospital. I spoke to her this morning and she seems to be improving."

The infected lambs arrived at the pet shop at the end of March [2018] and were then treated in a non-public isolation unit. Staff first became unwell last [Thu 5 Apr 2018].

Mr. Smith said: "If we have sick animals they go into isolation. It is people who have been looking after them who fell ill. We sent stool samples away for tests. I have not been able to get the results yet. We think it is [an infection by] _Cryptosporidium_. It is common in a lot of animals."

_Cryptosporidium_ is a parasite that causes mild to severe watery diarrhoea. It is often accompanied by stomach pain, vomiting and fever, and affects between 3000 and 6000 people a year in England and Wales.

[Cryptosporidiosis, infection with _Cryptosporidium_ spp., is endemic in ruminants including sheep, cattle and goats. Transmission is seen in so called "petting farms" where children are close to animals, swimming pools (resistant to chlorination) and where surface water is used for drinking water. Animals may not be ill and thus quarantine is not a method to ensure the animals are not infected before the customers come in contact with them. - Mod.EP
