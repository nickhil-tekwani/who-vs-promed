I am not familiar with your list or the interests of its subscribers. A
posted item regarding the Japanese pearl oyster article was forwarded to
me. For those interested, here is some information which was up to date as
of April 1, 1998.
The verified information is that there have been pearl oyster mortalities
over about the last 1 1/2 years in five or so major production sites in
Japan.
No infectious etiology has been demonstrated although the limited
information available in regard to epidemiology suggests spread of a
transmissible agent. However, there remains a need for systematically
collected information to better establish the magnitude and geographic
distribution of the problem.
Certainly no virus has been isolated from diseased pearl oysters. [There
are no cell cultures for marine invertebrates in existence. There has been
one [possibly more claim of a possible viral etiology based on limited
ultrastructural observations but nothing solidly convincing that I am aware
of, even to support the contention that a virus is present. The same
comments apply for other types of infectious agents.
There are several research groups in Japan, including the National
Fisheries Research Agency, and university groups working to some extent on
this issue.
