The 1st major outbreak of theileria -- a mainly tick spread disease occasionally fatal to cattle -- in the South Island has been found in a dairy herd on the West Coast.

Tests confirmed last week that the unidentified herd had theileria after a farmer reported cows were showing signs of anaemia. Cows within the herd were understood to have previously been grazed in Canterbury.

First appearing in Northland in 2012, the theileria strain called ikeda, a blood-borne parasite, was across much of the North Island.

Known cases were previously restricted in the south to a single dairy cow last year [2013] in Canterbury, believed to have been moved from the North Island, and possibly infected heifers more lately coming from the Hawke's Bay.

The Ministry for Primary Industries [MPI] is understood to be sending out information to veterinarians to restrict its spread and raise awareness of the disease and animal management.

A local population of ticks either in Canterbury or the West Coast is suspected to be responsible for the infection as there was no apparent North Island connection.

This has yet to be confirmed as an investigation failed to fully show that ikeda was spread by a tick to infect the Canterbury dairy cow previously.

However, authorities believe the outbreak shows it will reach more South Island farms in the future. This depends on how easily ticks establish south of the Tasman area where they are found. While ticks have established for short periods in southern parts of the South Island previously, the climate is often unsuitable for numbers building.

The disease causes anaemia in cows in a breakdown of red cells. Signs include red urine, low appetite, pale mucous membranes, lethargy, and low milk production.

DairyNZ says farmers need to be aware of the disease and its signs and regional teams will work with them to give advice.

DairyNZ veterinary technical policy adviser Nita Harding said theileria had spread widely in the north.

"Theileria is only in areas where there are ticks so we have been keeping a close eye on the South Island because we know there are ticks in the Nelson and Marlborough area. We are not aware of ticks elsewhere, but that's not to say there could be small populations that we aren't aware of and this (West Coast) case only came to light the last few weeks."

She said further investigations would hopefully shed light if the theileria infection had come from Canterbury or the West Coast.

Southern farmers observing anaemia in cows should contact their vets, she said.

Theileria cases jumped by 45 in the month after 11 Jul [2014?] to bring the total to 717 mostly in dairy herds. Most cases this year had been concentrated around the Waikato and Auckland regions with drift towards the East Cape, Manawatu and Taranaki [North Island].

[Some North Island cattle are suffering anaemia as the result of infection with a strain of the parasite _Theileria orientalis_, called Ikeda. The infection is spread by ticks.

The issue 1st appeared in Northland in August 2012 and since then cases have been found across the North Island, but predominantly in the upper island. The bulk of cases appear in areas where ticks are very prevalent. It appears tick populations increased rapidly as a result of last summer's drought and the mild winter may mean they have survived and become active early this season.

MPI, the New Zealand Veterinary Association and the beef, dairy and farm industry bodies are monitoring the situation closely and providing information to farmers and veterinarians.

It would not be possible to eliminate this parasite from New Zealand because the cattle tick which carries the parasite is widespread. In tick areas of the North Island, farmers should work with their veterinarians or farm health advisors to plan the best approach to recognising cattle that might be ill and providing treatment where necessary.

Where herds are infected with the ikeda strain, the impacts can vary greatly dependant on a number of factors including animal health, nutrition, stress, and previous exposure to _Theileria_. Most cattle will not show obvious signs of illness. A very small proportion of cattle in a herd will suffer severe anaemia, which if left untreated, could lead to the death of the animal.

What is _Theileria_?
-------------------
_Theileria orientalis_ is a parasite that is transmitted by ticks when they feed on the animal's blood.

Cattle are at risk of infection when they are moved to areas where infected ticks are present. Likewise, if an infected animal is transported, it can spread infection to ticks in the new location, in turn spreading disease to uninfected animals. In areas where the disease is known to occur there may be outbreaks in resident cattle in times when there are sudden increases in tick numbers.

The disease is not spread by direct animal-to-animal contact in the absence of ticks. There are no human health or food safety risks associated with _Theileria_.

What to look out for -- information for farmers and veterinarians
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The signs of anaemia in cattle include straggling on the walk to the shed, pale rather than healthy pink vulva, and pale udders noticed at milking.

Farmers may notice animals lagging behind the rest of the mob when being shifted or lying down in the paddock.

Try not to stress and move affected animals, as their reduced capacity to transport oxygen around the body can lead to collapse and death if you stress or move them quickly.

Affected animals should be rested, given high quality feed and water, and handled only when necessary.

There are a number of causes of anaemia and its signs can be similar to those of other diseases.

Farmers who suspect they have animals with anaemia should contact their vet for advice.

Advice on prevention and control for _Theileria_
------------------------------------------------
Ticks are considered the main means of spread of _Theileria_.

The control of ticks is strongly advised. Farmers in affected areas should be regularly checking their stock for ticks and treating animals as necessary.

Treat any new animals -- make particular effort to treat cattle before moving from one property to another.

Manage the tick population -- inspect cattle for presence of ticks. Tick treatments can be useful to reduce the tick load and the severity of the disease.

Ease underlying disease or stress -- for example, transition management, trace element deficiency, BVD (bovine viral diarrhoea) and facial eczema.

While the Ministry for Primary Industries has put this out with regard to the North Island, it now appears it may equally apply to the South Island.
