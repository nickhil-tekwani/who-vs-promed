The Ministry of Health of the Republic of Congo [DRC] is launching an emergency mass-vaccination campaign against yellow fever in Ewo District in Cuvette-Ouest region beginning next week.

The emergency vaccination campaign aims to cover approximately 35 000 people in 3 health districts of Mbama, Ewo and Okoyo, all of which belong to the administrative district of Ewo.

The emergency vaccination campaign is being carried out after recent confirmation of a case with yellow fever virus infection that occurred in October 2012. The case was identified through the national surveillance programme for yellow fever.

Laboratory confirmation was done at Institut National de Recherche Biomedicale Kinshasa (INRB) and reconfirmed by a WHO regional reference laboratory for yellow fever, Institut Pasteur, Dakar, Senegal.

The vaccination campaign is being supported by the International Coordinating Group on Yellow Fever Vaccine Provision (YF-ICG), the GAVI Alliance, and the European Commission's Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection Department (ECHO).

The YF-ICG is a partnership that manages the stockpile of yellow fever vaccines for emergency response on the basis of a rotation fund. It is represented by United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), and WHO, which also serves as the Secretariat. The stockpile was created by GAVI Alliance.

[Yellow fever occurs sporadically in rural areas of the DRC. The Ewo district is a forested area in eastern DRC. YF virus infection in this case is presumably from the sylvan (jungle) cycle of transmission. Since there have been no reports of subsequent cases in the area since the initial case in October 2012, this may have been an isolated case without further human-mosquito-human transmission. Nonetheless, vaccination of people in the area where the case occurred is prudent. ProMED would appreciate receiving reports of any additional cases.
