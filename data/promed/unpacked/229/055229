Romanian killer bear had rabies
---------------------------------
The authorities in Brasov, central Romania, have declared a rabies alert,
after an infected brown bear killed 2 men and injured 6 others.
Brasov is under quarantine, and a close watch is being kept on animals
there. The forested area on the edge of the city, where the attack took
place on Saturday [16 Oct 2004], is being sealed off. Romanian television
says doctors have started vaccinating more than 100 people who came into
contact with the rabid bear or its victims.
While foraging for food, the bear, believed to be a female, attacked 5
people out picking mushrooms, and, fell on 3 others in another part of the
woods. One man is said to have died at the scene. Hunters shot and killed
the bear several hours after the attack. The animal had also attacked an
ambulance sent to help. Tests conducted at the Pasteur Institute in
Bucharest confirmed the bear had rabies.
A hospital official in Brasov told the AFP news agency that a 2nd injured
man died "after his condition weakened, due to being diabetic. His death
was not caused by rabies."
Cameraman Ciprian Oana, of private Pro TV Brasov, said he had visited the
scene. "I was asked to help with the transport of the injured. I got blood
all over my hands. That is why I think it is necessary to be vaccinated,"
he said.
Police have been mobilized to patrol the outskirts of Brasov to stop bears
reaching residential areas and rummaging through garbage bins. George
Scripcaru, a municipal official quoted by AFP, said people on the outskirts
had been "unknowingly encouraging" wild animals to forage for food.
Romania has thousands of brown bears living in the wild, and they often
come close to Brasov, a city of 350 000 people surrounded by large forested
areas in the mountainous Transylvania region.
