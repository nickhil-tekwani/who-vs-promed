[The location of the outbreak can be seen on the map included in the OIE report at the source URL above.

According to the EU's Animal Disease Notification System (ADNS) most recent available issue (update of 7 May 2013), since 1 Jan 2013, LPAI events (poultry) have been recorded in 3 EU member states (in brackets, number of events): Germany (6), Italy (1), and Netherlands (2). During 2012, the affected countries were Ireland (1), Italy (16), and Netherlands (2).

According to OIE's statistics, Spain's last LPAI event in poultry was recorded in June 2009, namely in Navarre, caused by H5N3. 54 birds ("cases") were registered among 27 903 susceptible "birds", all culled according to EU's 'stamping out' policy.

The designation of "species" as "birds" is rather general, lacking epidemiologically essential details. Which bird species has (have) been involved in this event? "Poultry" may mean chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese, and other domesticated birds, including backyard poultry, used for the production of meat or eggs for consumption, for the production of other commercial products, for restocking supplies of game, or for breeding these categories of birds. The maintenance methods applied in relation to the affected population is of epidemiological significance as well. The birds could be kept indoors or allowed free-ranching; in each case, their exposure to the virus could be of different nature. Such issues could be addressed under the article "affected population", which is allowed by OIE's questionnaire.

The information lacking above is hereby requested. - Mod.AS
