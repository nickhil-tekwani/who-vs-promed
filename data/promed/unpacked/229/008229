A meeting of the regional commission for the investigation of seal
mortality in the Kazakh water areas of the Caspian Sea, took place today
[14 May 2007, with participation of representatives from several ministries
of Kazakhstan, including the ministries of health, agriculture, and
emergencies], as well as representatives from the regional government.
[In an effort to clarify the causes of the seal deaths, 3 meetings with
site visits were carried out. The local authorities also surveyed the
territory with helicopters, and samples from carcasses and water were
collected.]
According to the information from the Ministry of Emergencies, as of 10 May
2007, there have been 928 dead seals. The number of dead fish is not
reported. According to laboratory analysis in the Atyrau region, the
concentration of phenol, heavy metals, oil products, and surface-active
material are [within the acceptable range]. The samples from the bodies of
seals submitted for sanitary-epidemiological analysis to the Ministry of
Health have shown no increased concentrations of copper, lead, cadmium,
mercury, zinc, or pesticides and their metabolites.
Following laboratory tests in the Research Institute of Biological Safety,
the "febris catarrhalis et nervosa canum" virus (canine distemper virus)
was identified. The results were verified by the Institute of Microbiology
and Virology of the Ministry of Health, Kazakhstan. [Neither of these
laboratories found Influenza A or B viruses.] The commission made some
recommendations for the prevention of similar incidents in the Kazakh
waters of the Caspian Sea.

[Atyrau is located on the northern tip of the Caspian Sea, and can be seen
on the map at
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/commonwealth/kazakhstan_pol01.jpg>. A
previous die-off of Caspian seals (_Phoca caspica_), due to canine
distemper virus (CDV) infection, was reported in 2000.
Canine distemper virus is a morbillivirus which, in 1987-1988, caused high
mortality among Baikal seals (_Phoca siberica_) in Lake Baikal in Siberia,
and was suspected of having caused a die-off of crabeater seals in
Antarctica, in 1955. In recent years, other morbilliviruses (phocine and
cetacean morbilliviruses) have caused several major epizootics among
aquatic mammal populations in various regions of the world. - Mod.AS]
