[With the addition of these 4 newly reported cases of MERS-CoV infection, the total number of cases reported through the Saudi MOH surveillance systems is now 1341, including 567 deaths. One of the 4 newly confirmed cases is an asymptomatic healthcare worker from Buraidah, the location of the currently reported nosocomial outbreak in the King Fahd Specialist Hospital, bringing the total number of reported cases from Buraidah to 21 cases, including 8 deaths. There have been 6 MERS-CoV infections in healthcare workers from Buraidah confirmed in this outbreak, representing 28.6% of the cases -- 3 of whom were reported to be in stable condition and 3 of whom were reported to be asymptomatic at the time of the initial confirmation reports. Information that would be of interest includes what percentage of documented asymptomatic infections remain asymptomatic throughout the course of the infection as well as the documented duration of virus excretion in asymptomatic infected individuals.

The additional 3 newly reported cases come from geographically dispersed areas, one from Baha, located in the southwest of the country, one in Riyadh, and one in Hail, located in the northwest of the country. Buraidah, the focus of the ongoing nosocomial outbreak, is located in the north central part of the country between Riyadh and Hail. A good map showing the locations of the newly reported cases can be found at the source URL.

According to the ECDC Communicable Disease Threats Report, week 10 (6-12 Mar 2016), as of 10 Mar 2016, there have been 1701 cases of MERS-CoV infection, including 652 deaths, reported by health authorities in 25 countries.

In the past 2 days since 10 Mar 2016, there have been a total of 6 newly confirmed cases and 3 deaths reported by Saudi Arabia, bringing the global total of cases to 1707, including 655 deaths (reported case fatality rate 38.4 percent).
