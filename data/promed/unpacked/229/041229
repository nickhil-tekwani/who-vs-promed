Ten cases have been confirmed and there is one "probable" case of
meningococcal [_Neisseria meningitidis_ infection in England and Wales
that have been associated with pilgrims who returned from the haj in Saudi
Arabia since 21 Mar 2000. Nine cases are confirmed to have [been infected
with _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup W135 infection. Three of these
cases have died. One case has meningococcal infection of unknown serogroup.
Eight of the cases, including two women who died, made the pilgrimage; the
other cases, including a 2-year-old boy who died, are contacts [of those
who made the pilgrimage.
There are no direct links between the pilgrim cases but Saudi officials say
that 1.25 million pilgrims came from abroad and conditions on the
pilgrimage were extremely crowded; there are reports of over ten people
sharing hotel rooms. Four confirmed cases of group W135 disease and one
provisional case have been reported from France and a case of meningococcal
disease (group not reported) has been reported from Germany.
The haj lasted from 15 to 18 Mar 2000, but visas were granted allowing
pilgrims to stay until the middle of April. The risk period may therefore
continue for some time. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of
meningococcal infection in returning pilgrims.
Large outbreaks of group A meningococcal infection have occurred in
association with the haj (1,2) and the Saudi authorities require visitors
on pilgrimage to produce proof of vaccination against group A meningococcal
infection (groups A and C for those over 2 years of age) (3).

In France, three people have died from meningitis [presumably due to
_Neisseria meningitidis_and three more are sick with the illness after
returning to France from a pilgrimage to the sacred Saudi Arabian city of
Mecca. Chief medical officer Lucien Abenhaim said the death Saturday of a
baby brought to three the number of people who had been killed by the
disease after having made the journey to Saudi Arabia.
Of the other three stricken by the illness, one was in a critical
condition, said Abenhaim. Other reliable sources said doctors had
discovered the cases in the southwest town of Bordeaux; at Reims in the
north; and in the Paris region. The outbreak is thought to have originated
in the city of Mecca.
They recommended that returning pilgrims, or anyone living with one, should
consult their doctor or a hospital without delay for preventive treatment.
"Fever and headaches are signs that require an immediate and urgent
consultation with a doctor," said the health service. Other cases had
already been recorded in Britain and Germany, said the health ministry.

[The vaccination requirements for the haj are published by WHO in the WER
(Weekly Epidemiological Record) every year in advance.It would be
interesting to learn if any of those infected with _Neisseria meningitidis_
serogroup W135 received an immunization against this serogroup and would,
therefore, be classified as vaccine failures. ProMED-mail would be
interested to learn of other confirmed cases of _N. meningitidis_ serogroup
135 in travelers and contacts of travelers to the haj, including those
alluded to in Germany. - Man. Ed. DS
