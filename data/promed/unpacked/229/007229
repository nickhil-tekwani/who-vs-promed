There must be some degree of misinformation. Even if used in higher
concentrations, and injected subcutaneously, BCG vaccine will not cause
tuberculosis. Disseminated BCG infection, that keeps certain similarity
with tuberculosis may occur, but it can be differentiated in clinical,
epidemiological and microbiological grounds.
Errors bound to happen if untrained personnel are employed are:
(1) inadequate dilution, i.e., a higher than appropriate concentration is
injected
(2) injection of larger volumes
(3) subcutaneous injection.

This report make[s me remember the report about leprosy, in the South
Pacific that was so ridiculous speaking of an epide[mic of this disease.
It says nothing of what kind of bacillus they are speaking and quickly they
say that the vaccine is the cause of all the trouble. To say that a vaccine
is the cause of the problem they must investigate if the bacillus of the
patients is the same bacillus, M. bovis of the vaccine. It is very rare
that a [tuberculosis vaccine causes a generalized illness, it only causes
a local problem. It's not the same to speak of [tuberculosis than of a
ganglion [tuberculosis caused by a vaccine. Please it is important to
speak clearly in medicine and so [much more through the mail.

I'm sorry to be so obtuse, but could one of the moderators, or perhaps the
originator of this report, explain to me how tuberculosis can be acquired
by vaccination? I am only guessing that the vaccination being discussed is
the use of BCG - is this correct? As far as I knew, this could not result
in transmission of active tuberculosis, though immunosuppressed patients
can develop disseminated disease with BCG.

I am concerned about the content of this report. It implies that a group of
children were vaccinated with BCG (?) and came down with tuberculosis. A
number of questions must be answered. Was the vaccine actually BCG? Was it
contaminated with a virulent form of _M. bovis_ or _M. tuberculosis_? Was
the difficulty in treating these children due to the presence of drug
resistant organisms? How did the disease present? Could you please request
additional information about this very disturbing issue?

[With varying degrees of collegiality subscribers have pointed out that
complications associated with BCG vaccination are uncommon when the vaccine
is used properly, and that when they do occur, those complications are
distinguishible from classical presentations of tuberculosis. It should be
noted that post-vaccination complications in children have been reported to
include lymphadenitis (1-4) and osteitis (1,4), and a syndrome referred to
as multisystem postvaccination tuberculosis (3). It is apparent from the
literature that there are several strains of BCG vaccine organism in use
around the globe, and that the Moscow BCG strain has previously been known
to cause complications in a dose-dependent manner. We cannot tell from the
previous posting which vaccine strain was used, or the precise nature of
the complications observed. Additional information from those familiar with
the outbreak would be appreciated. Thanks to all who responded. - Mod.ES
