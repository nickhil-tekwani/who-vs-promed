The Department of Health has recorded a steep rise in the incidence of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) among children nationwide, with more than 600 cases reported in the last 7 months.

In a surveillance report, the DOH said 612 suspected HFMD cases were recorded from 1 Jan to 4 Jul this year [2015], 175.7 percent higher than the 222 cases reported in the same period last year [2014].

The Cagayan Valley registered the largest number of cases, at 23.7 percent of cases, followed by Calabarzon, 20.1 percent; northern Mindanao, 15.5 percent; Metro Manila, 9.6 percent, and Mimaropa, 5.4 percent.

60 percent of the cases involved males, with more than half of the cases hitting the 1- to 4-year-old age group. No deaths were reported, according to the health department. HFMD is a common infectious disease caused by a group of enteroviruses, including Coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) and Enterovirus 71 (EV71). The DOH said that infection by the latter was of "particular concern" since it could cause severe disease in children, sometimes resulting in death.

HFMD affects mainly children and is commonly spread through direct contact with secretions, such as saliva, from infected people. Symptoms include fever that may last 24 to 48 hours, painful mouth sores and rashes and blisters on the hands, feet and buttocks. The DOH said there was no particular treatment for HFMD and medications given were usually for the relief of symptoms, such as fever and sore throat.

Warning that there was no specific way to prevent being infected with HFMD, the DOH advised the public to strictly observe good hygiene, such as frequent hand washing, to lessen the risk of catching the disease.

[Excerpted from PM Vijayaraghavan, S Chandy et al. Virological Investigation of Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease in a Tertiary Care Center in South India. J Glob Infect Dis.4(3); July-September 2012 (http://www.jgid.org/article.asp?issn=0974-777X;year=2012;volume=4;issue=3;spage=153;epage=161;aulast=Vijayaraghavan):

Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a mild, self-limiting, exanthematous disease of infants and children below 10 years of age. Human enterovirus 71 (HEV-71) and Coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16) are common etiological agents causing HFMD epidemics. Other Enteroviruses (EV) causing sporadic HFMD cases include CV-A4 to CV-A7, CV-A9, CV-A10, CV-B1 to CV-B3, and CV- B5. The characteristic distribution of the vesicle gives the disease its name. HFMD usually spreads from person-to-person through contact with nose or throat discharges, feces or vesicular fluid.

The etiological agents of HFMD belong to the _Enterovirus_ genus, family Picornaviridae. They are small, non-enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses. HEV-71-related HFMD epidemics in Singapore, Sarawak, and Taiwan have reported serious complications like encephalitis, myocarditis, and death. Comparatively, CV-A16 causes milder infections than HEV-71.

Enterovirus infections are common in children under 4 years of age and peak incidence is seen in one-year-olds. Moreover, infants younger than 6 months of age had lower mortality compared to those 0.5 to under one year of age. Highly susceptible children congregate in childcare centers, kindergartens, and preschools.

[Epub ahead of print] (http://journals.lww.com/co-infectiousdiseases/Abstract/publishahead/The_epidemiology_of_non_polio_enteroviruses__.99487.aspx).

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There are over 100 serotypes of human enteroviruses, which cause a spectrum of illnesses, including meningitis, encephalitis, paralysis, myocarditis and rash. Increasing incidence of hand-foot-and-mouth disease in the Asia-Pacific region and recent outbreaks of enterovirus-associated disease, such as severe respiratory illness in the United States in 2014, highlight the threat of these viruses to human health.

RECENT FINDINGS: We describe recent outbreaks of human enteroviruses and summarize knowledge gaps regarding their burden, spectrum of diseases and epidemiology.

SUMMARY: Reported outbreaks of respiratory, neurological, skin and eye diseases associated with human enteroviruses have increased in frequency and size in recent years. Improved molecular diagnostics and genetic sequence analysis are beginning to reveal the complex dynamics of individual serotypes and genotypes, and their contribution to these outbreaks. However, the biological mechanisms underlying their emergence and transmission dynamics remain elusive. They are likely to involve changes in the virus, such as fitness, antigenicity, virulence or tropism, and in the human population, such as levels of sanitation and of homotypic and heterotypic immunity. Improvements in surveillance, serological surveys and detailed genetic and antigenic characterization of viral populations would help to elucidate these mechanisms. This will be important for the design of outbreak control and vaccine development strategies. ... -more
