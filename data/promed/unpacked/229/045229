Love for chicken delicacies -- be it butter chicken or fried -- may involve a health risk for not only Indians, but the entire world, a new study warns [1]. According to the Indo-American study, Punjab, famous for its large and crowded poultry farms, may be sprouting "superbugs" or bacteria that are resistant to routine antibiotics.

The study reports high prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria detected in poultry farms in Punjab and warns of potentially disastrous consequences on human health due to use of growth-promoting antibiotics in animal farming.

"The world is on the brink of losing these miracle cures," said recently retired WHO Director-General Margaret Chan, referring to antibiotics that were hailed as "wonder drugs."

Crowded poultry farms could be breeding superbugs in Punjab, finds the new study. Next time you get an infection that is hard to cure by routine antibiotics, a phenomenon ominously called the emergence of superbugs, one may want to blame the poultry farms, especially from Punjab, where, experts say, use of antibiotics is rampant for rapidly fattening chickens.

Poultry farms are deploying antibiotics not to treat sick animals, but to fatten them quickly. The study led by researchers from the Centre for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy (CDDEP), Washington DC, published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives, finds high levels of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in chickens raised for both meat and eggs on farms in Punjab [1].

The study raises serious concerns over the use of antibiotics for growth promotion in farm animals. "Overuse of antibiotics in animal farms endangers us all as it multiplies drug resistance in the environment," said study author and CDDEP Director Ramanan Laxminarayan. "Punjab is one of the leading states in India in poultry farming. It is critical that we take measures to end the use of antibiotics for growth promotion in animal breeding practices."

According to the WHO, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) threatens the effective prevention and treatment of an ever-increasing range of infections caused by bacteria, parasites, viruses and fungi.

The Punjab poultry farm survey is the largest study of its kind looking at sources of AMR ever to be conducted in India. Researchers collected more than 1500 samples from 530 birds at 18 poultry farms in 6 districts of Punjab and tested these for resistance to a range of antibiotics.

2/3rds of the farms reported using antibiotics for growth promotion; these farms were also nearly 3 times more likely to report multi-drug resistant bacteria than those that did not use antibiotics for growth promotion. "AMR has huge implications for India," says Dr Henk Bekedam, WHO representative in India. Unfortunately, some of the blame falls on the lifeless but tasty tandoori chicken.

[The following is the abstract from the journal article referenced in the above news report:

"BACKGROUND: Agricultural use of antimicrobials in subtherapeutic concentrations is increasing in response to the rising demand for food animal products worldwide. In India, the use of antimicrobials in food animal production is unregulated. Research suggests that many clinically important antimicrobials are used indiscriminately. This is the largest study to date in India that surveys poultry production to test for antimicrobial resistance and the occurrence of extended-spectrum [beta]-lactamases (ESBLs) modulated by farming and managerial practices.

"OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to survey poultry production for resistance to 11 clinically relevant antimicrobials and phenotypic occurrence of ESBLs as modulated by farming and managerial practices.

"METHODS: Eighteen poultry farms from Punjab were surveyed, and 1,556 _Escherichia coli_ isolates from 530 birds were tested for susceptibility to 11 antimicrobials using the disk diffusion method and validated using VITEK 2 (bioMérieux, Marcy-L'Étoile, France). Samples from 510 of these birds were phenotypically tested for ESBL production using the combination disk method and confirmed using VITEK 2. Generalized linear mixed models were used to infer differences in resistance profiles associated with different farming practices and facility types.

"RESULTS: Resistance profiles were significantly different between broiler and layer farms. Broiler farms were 2.2 [ampicillin (AMP), p = 0:017] to 23 [nalidixic acid (NX), p under 0:001] times more likely to harbor resistant _E. coli_ strains than layer farms. Adjusting for farm type (broiler vs. layer), the odds of resistance (although not statistically significant) to all antimicrobials except nitrofurantoin (NIT) were higher in independent facilities (IUs) as compared to contracted facilities (CFs). Increased prevalence of multidrug resistance (MDR; 94% compared to 60% in layers), including prevalence of ESBL-producing strains (87% compared to 42% in layers), was observed in broiler farms.

"CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that unregulated use of clinically relevant antimicrobials in Indian broiler and layer farms may contribute to the emergence of resistance and support the need to curb the nontherapeutic use of medically important antimicrobials in food animal production."

Prior ProMED-mail posts have reported on the high rates of antimicrobial resistance in both human populations and the environment in India (see ProMED-mail posts Antibiotic resistance (04): India, China, environmental pollution 20161020.4574059, Antibiotic resistance (03): India (TG) environmental pollution 20161010.4548738, and Antibiotic resistance - India: (Delhi) E. coli, MDR, river water pollution 20151209.3850743). This study referenced by the news report above found that, on the surveyed poultry farms, of 510 cloacal samples collected for ESBL detection, 305 (59.8%) _E. coli_ were ESBL-positive. The study also found that this high level of ESBL production in poultry facilities varied by type of poultry facility: an astounding 87% of cloacal samples from broiler farms were ESBL-positive, whereas 42% from layer farms were ESBL-positive.

The prevalence of multidrug resistant (MDR) _E. coli_ was also higher in broiler farms (94%) as compared to layer farms (60%). ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae are usually highly resistant to multiple classes of antimicrobial drugs. In MDR organisms, genes encoding resistance are frequently linked so that exposure on farms to only one of the antibiotics whose resistance is genetically linked will select for emergence of resistance to the other genetically linked drugs.

The authors of the study say that use of antimicrobials in animal husbandry in India is mostly unregulated; in fact, all the poultry farms included in this study used antimicrobials, usually for growth promotion rather than for disease prevention or treatment. However, the study was unable to obtain data on the exact types and amounts of antimicrobials used by the poultry facilities studied.

Colonization of farm workers with antibiotic-resistant Enterobacteriaceae of animal origin has been found in European and North American studies (see ProMED-mail posts Staph. aureus - USA: (NC) livestock-associated, farm workers 20161119.4640552; Staph. aureus (MRSA) - UK: meat products, ST398 20150718.3519015; Staph. aureus (MRSA) - Denmark: porcine, human, ST398, increased incidence 20140827.2725468; and Staph. aureus (MRSA) - USA: (NC) livestock-associated, farm workers 20130715.1825814) and is likely to have occurred in workers at the studied poultry facilities, as their workers frequently took no precautions when in contact with the poultry or their contaminated environment. Antibiotic resistance could then spread to the general population via contact with poultry, the contaminated environment of poultry farms, their workers, and food products. Molecular typing of resistance genes in poultry, the poultry farm workers and environment, and the general human population would help identify transmission pathways, as the study's authors acknowledge. - Mod.ML
