Avian influenza in Chile: follow-up report No. 3
------------------------------------------------
Translation of information received on 29 June 2002 from Dr Hernan Rojas
Olavarria, Director, Department of Animal Protection, Department of
Agriculture and Animal Production (SAG), Ministry of Agriculture, Santiago:
Previous report period ended 17 June 2002 (see Disease Information, 15
[25], 103, dated 21 June 2002). End of this report period: 28 June 2002.
a. Avian influenza situation in the Province of San Antonio, Fifth Region
(Valparaiso)
Outbreak No. 1 is being disinfected after having been depopulated. To date,
in outbreak No. 2, the non-depopulated sectors are under daily
surveillance, with no increased mortality and negative serology up to now.
Cloacal and tracheal swabs have been collected to isolate the virus in
embryonated eggs.
In the perifocal areas (10-km radius), weekly sampling has been established
for commercial establishments and fortnightly sampling for backyard
poultry. There are 17 industrial establishments and about 150 owners of
backyard poultry. Positive serology for avian influenza has been
demonstrated in only 3 of these industrial establishments, one of which
belongs to the same company that owns the establishments designated as the
outbreaks. No virus isolates have been obtained to date. No positive
serology for avian influenza has been detected in backyard poultry in the
perifocal areas, nor in the rest of the free area.
Strict biosecurity and quarantine measures are being maintained in
establishments in the perifocal areas.
b. Avian influenza situation nationwide
A massive nationwide serological sampling operation was conducted during
the month following detection of infection by the avian influenza virus, to
detect any possible spread of the disease. More than 48 845 serological
samples were collected from broiler and layer grandparent flocks, broiler
fattening units, and layer units, ostrich, emu, duck, goose and pheasant
farms, aviary birds, backyard poultry, zoo birds, and wild and migratory
birds. A total of 358 commercial poultry establishments were sampled (all
the country's avian establishments), 284 backyard poultry holdings, and 4
wild bird sites.
The results indicate positive serology for avian influenza in 21
establishments, belonging to 5 poultry enterprises, in the central area of
the country (Fifth and Sixth Regions and Metropolitan Region). Only 2 of
the 21 establishments with serological evidence (outbreaks 1 and 2) also
presented raised mortality compatible with avian influenza. Both the
production parameters and mortality in the remaining 19 establishments are
normal for the different production lineages and stages.
All of the suspect establishments are under strict quarantine. Avian
influenza virus was isolated from some of the suspect establishments and
typed by the OIE Reference Laboratory in Ames, Iowa (United States of
America), as serotype H7N3. The establishments from which the virus was
isolated still have normal mortality rates and their production parameters
are within the norms defined for their genetic lineage.
The hypothesis that the positive serological results originated from the
use of biological products contaminated with the avian influenza virus
antigen is still not conclusive and continues to be investigated. The
development of a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (1) test
in the SAG Central Laboratory is proceeding, in order to increase the
laboratory's diagnostic capacity to deal with this emergency situation.
c. Viral isolation and typing
Virus isolates obtained from the suspect establishments by the SAG Central
Laboratory and sent to the Ames Reference Laboratory were typed as H7N3.
Preliminary results of tests carried out by the SAG Central Laboratory to
measure the pathogenicity index would appear to indicate that some of these
isolates behave like a highly pathogenic strain. The samples were sent to
the Ames Reference Laboratory, which reported difficulty in obtaining the
sequencing information and suggested that there might be a combination of
two different H7N3 genotypes present. Due to the unusual sequence, it is
still impossible to predict the potential virulence of the isolate. The
laboratory hopes to finish characterising the isolates soon.
The indications emerging from the SAG Central Laboratory's pathogenicity
test bear no relation to what is being observed in the field. While raised
mortality has been observed in only two establishments (outbreaks 1 and 2),
other pathologies and a process of poisoning concomitant with the detection
of avian influenza were also detected in those establishments. This means
that the raised mortality observed cannot be attributed entirely to the
active strain of avian influenza virus.
In accordance with the above-mentioned indications, it can be concluded
that the avian influenza episode in Chile is now under control, since the
disease continues to be limited to one area of the country, where all the
necessary prevention and control measures are being applied.

Avian influenza in Chile: follow-up report No. 4
------------------------------------------------
Translation of information received on 1 July 2002 from Dr Hernan Rojas
Olavarria, Director, Department of Animal Protection, Department of
Agriculture and Animal Production (SAG), Ministry of Agriculture, Santiago:
End of previous report period: 28 June 2002 (see Disease Information, 15
[27], 114, dated 5 July 2002). End of this report period: 1 July 2002.
The report was received from the OIE Reference Laboratory in Ames (United
States), characterising virus isolates received by Ames on 22 June 2002.
After completing the said characterisation it concluded that the 5 isolates
sent to the Ames laboratory correspond to serotype H7N3 and that they are
highly pathogenic, as shown by the results of the pathogenicity index test
in inoculated birds, all of which died on the 4th day after inoculation.
The Ames Laboratory reported that the amino acid sequence of the cleavage
site was highly unusual, saying it was not possible to predict the
pathogenicity of the isolates based on the amino acid sequence. There
appeared, however, to be an insertion of 10 amino acids at the cleavage
site in the low pathogenic H7N3 virus that was initially isolated in Chile.
This insertion is probably responsible for increasing the virulence of the
latest isolates. Finally, 2 different amino acid profiles were detected in
the latter isolates.
Furthermore, on 1 July 2002, the OIE Reference Laboratory in Weybridge
(VLA), United Kingdom, also reported that it had carried out the
pathogenicity test on the isolates from Chile, saying that the index
obtained in one of the isolates was 2.96 and in the other 3.00 and
concluding that they were highly pathogenic. They will be processing the
three remaining isolates this week.
The situation nationwide notified in follow-up report No. 3, concerning the
measures adopted and their evolution, leads us to conclude that the episode
is under control.

[It is good that control measures were previously under way as this virus
was clearly evolving from one with low pathogenicity found in the field to
a laboratory confirmed highly pathogenic strain. The veterinary authorities
in Chile may not be out of the woods yet. I wonder how commonly there is a
lack of correlation between field observations and laboratory results. -
