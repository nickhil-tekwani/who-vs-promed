In October 2005, a 3-month-old male infant presented with a weakness
of the right upper limb. One day later, he developed bilateral lower
limb paralysis with diminished reflexes. Poliovirus identical to
Sabin 2 strain was isolated from 3 sets of stool specimens
(respectively 100 percent, 99.67 percent, 99.89 percent similarity to
VP1 nucleic acid sequence). A lumbar puncture was performed and the
cerebrospinal fluid analysis was normal. Neither pleocytosis (white
cell: 0/mm3) nor an elevated level of protein (57 mg/dl) was found.
The results of magnetic resonance image and nerve conduction studies
proved polyneuropathy. The case was then reported to the AFP
reporting system and diagnosed as GB [Guillain-Barre] syndrome. The
stool samples taken from the close contacts were all negative for
enteroviruses. In May 2006, paralysis of the bilateral lower limbs
(more severe on left side) and monoplegia of an upper right limb were
still found present in the infant.
Tracing the infant's history, a perianal abscess was found at 15 days
of age, which subsided after oral antibiotic therapy. He received
oral poliomyelitis vaccine (OPV) at 2 months of age. The infant was
admitted to hospital due to fever and bleeding from an anal fistula
21 days after the immunization. He received a fistulectomy the next
day, but paralysis appeared 2 days after the operation. The parents
suspected the severe symptoms could be related to OPV, so they
applied for the national VICP in 2006 asking for compensation. After
review by the committee, the presence of vaccine-associated paralytic
poliomyelitis (VAPP) was suspected in the patient.
One case reported in the Journal of Infection, published in 2003,
also described a similar condition [see ref 5 below]. A 4-month-old
immunocompetent infant suffered from perianal abscess with surgical
intervention 3 days after OPV immunization. Paralysis developed 8
days later. Sabin-like polio virus type 1 and 3 were isolated from
his feces. He also had a high antibody titer to poliovirus type 3, so
VAPP was diagnosed.
The last polio case in Taiwan occurred in 1983, and polio has been
eradicated since 2000 in the West-Pacific region. However, since
there are outbreaks in neighboring countries and global polio
eradication is not yet achieved, the Taiwan ACIP still recommends
OPV. During polio epidemics in the 1970s, intramuscular injection and
surgery were forbidden as they probably activated the virus. Although
such cases are rare and there are still 14 percent of VAPP cases
without immunodisorders, the issue of whether to include surgery as
an OPV precaution will be discussed in the next ACIP meeting.

[Oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) has been associated with rare cases of vaccine-
associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) in individuals who have directly
received the vaccine and in contacts of recently vaccinated individuals. In
addition, there have been reports of cases of paralytic poliomyelitis
associated with a reversion to neurovirulence of circulating vaccine-derived
polioviruses (cVDPV).
With respect to the VAPPs, during 1980-1994, of 133 confirmed cases of
paralytic poliomyelitis reported in the USA, 125 (94 percent) were associated
with administration of OPV (annual mean: 8 VAPP cases) (6 were imported cases
and 2 were indeterminate without a poliovirus isolation, and no history of
direct or indirect contact with the OPV). Of the 125 VAPP cases, 49 (39
percent) were among immunologically normal recipients of OPV, 46 (37 percent)
among mmunologically normal contacts of OPV recipients (including 6 cases
among persons from whom vaccine-like poliovirus was isolated but who had no
history of direct contact with vaccinees), and 30 (24 percent) among
immunologically compromised OPV recipients or contacts of OPV recipients
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00045949.htm>. There have been no
further cases of VAPP reported in the USA since it changed its vaccination
policy to use IPV rather than OPV, -- see ref. below.
Given the above USA background on the decision-making process leading up to
the change in vaccine used for poliomyelitis prevention, the situation in the
USA is different from that in Taiwan, as mentioned by Drs. Chen & Liu. Taiwan
interrupted transmission of wild poliovirus in 1983, but is geographically
closer to a country where wild poliovirus circulation recently recurred
(Indonesia). A change to IPV is an expensive undertaking, and does carry the
inherent risk of not providing the same level of community immunity, as it
does not provide vaccination of contacts of vaccine recipients.
In the above report, Drs. Chen & Liu describe a case of post-OPV
surgery possibly associated with provocation poliomyelitis.
Provocation poliomyelitis was described as paralytic disease
occurring in a limb that had received an injection while an
individual was infected with a poliovirus. In Gromeier M & Wimmer E.
(see ref.6), the authors describe the pathogenic mechanism proposed
to explain provocation VAPP. "Skeletal muscle injury is known to
predispose its sufferers to neurological complications of concurrent
poliovirus infections. This phenomenon, labeled "provocation
poliomyelitis," continues to cause numerous cases of childhood
paralysis due to the administration of unnecessary injections to
children in areas where poliovirus is endemic.
Recently, it has been reported that intramuscular injections may also increase
the likelihood of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis in recipients of
live attenuated poliovirus vaccines. We have studied this important risk
factor for paralytic polio in an animal system for poliomyelitis and have
determined the pathogenic mechanism linking intramuscular injections and
provocation poliomyelitis. Skeletal muscle injury induces retrograde axonal
transport of poliovirus and thereby facilitates viral invasion of the central
nervous system and the progression of spinal cord damage. The pathogenic
mechanism of provocation poliomyelitis may differ from that of polio acquired
in the absence of predisposing factors."
While the literature does not have many reports of VAPP associated with
surgical procedures, one wonders if this might be a larger problem, and what
unpublished data on this phenomenon might exist.
