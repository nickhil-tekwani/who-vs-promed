On 7 May 2013, a technical seminar on Schmallenberg virus [SBV] disease was opened at the headquarters of the International Epizootic Bureau [OIE] (Paris, France). The seminar was attended by OIE experts, representatives of Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and the European Union. The Russian delegation was headed by the Deputy Head of the Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance, Chief Veterinary Officer Eugene Nepoklonov.

The main purpose of the workshop was to discuss the situation with SBV disease, including risk analysis of its spread, its diagnosis, and the required surveillance activities. The workshop was opened by OIE Director General Bernard Vallat, who stressed the importance of this event for the veterinary services of the Member Countries and international trade. He mentioned the publication of the OIE guidelines for SBV disease on the organisation's official website, which, however, may be subject to certain adjustments following the conclusions of the ongoing seminar.

The representative of the Technical Group on SBV, Ann Brigitte Cay, gave a presentation, which presented various aspects of the etiology, epidemiology, diagnosis, prevention and control measures against the disease, as well as some results of experimental animal infection trials with SBV.

In discussing the presentation, representatives of the Russian side noted that SBV disease is a relatively new, little-studied disease, so the adoption of the most stringent restrictive measures would be fully justified. Risk assessment and decisions could be attained only after receiving full information about all its aspects. At the moment, it is not fully clear which animal tissue(s) should be subjected to tests to define the location of persisting virus in convalescent animals. The length of periods for persisting antibodies are not clear. It is necessary to develop criteria for determining the status of countries regarding SBV.

Eugene Nepoklonov also stressed that SBV may behave differently in different geographical areas and that different strains of the pathogen might be circulating, causing different clinical manifestations of the disease. He also noted the inability to extrapolate the properties of genetically related [SBV viruses] without conducting additional research. He repeatedly raised the question of the lack of transparency of some countries on this issue, which affects the efficiency of the disease control efforts.

The Russian delegation proposed to include SBV disease in the OIE list, requiring its notification to enable a significant strengthening of control upon its distribution. The proposal was supported by the representatives of Belarus and Kazakhstan. However, OIE representatives indicated that the seminar was held for informational purposes only and was not intended for the adoption of an immediate decision on a proposal to declare SBV officially OIE notifiable.

The Deputy Chief Veterinary Officer of the Republic of Belarus, Ivan Smilgin, stressed that the absence of mandatory notification of SBV disease has led to the drift of the disease in the territory of a number of countries, leading to economic losses.

Chief Veterinary Officer of Kazakhstan Mereke Taytubaev raised the question of the possible impact of the virus on humans, and questioned the meaning of the expression "minimal risk."

During the 2nd part of the seminar, technical information and analysis of the spreading risk of SBV were discussed. The seminar participants exchanged views on the spread of the disease, specific risk materials, and other issues.

Concluding the seminar, Dr. Bernard Vallat once again explained to the participants the process of mainstreaming the OIE list of diseases, although the interpretation of some of the requirements of this procedure were divergent. In this regard, Dr. Bernard Vallat asked the representatives of Russia, Kazakhstan, and Belarus to send an official request to the OIE on the rationale for inclusion of Schmallenberg disease in the OIE list. A final decision on this matter can only be taken by the general assembly of the OIE.

Antibodies to Schmallenberg virus in domestic livestock in Turkey. Authors: Ahmet Kursat Azkur, Harun Albayrak, Ali Risvanli, Zuleyha Pestil, Emre Ozan, Oktay Yilmaz, Sukru Tonbak, Abdullah Cavunt, Hamza Kadi, Hasan Ceyhun Macun

Abstract:
This partly retrospective study was designed to determine the seroprevalence of Schmallenberg virus (SBV), a new Orthobunyavirus 1st reported in Germany in late 2011 in domestic ruminants from the Middle Black Sea, West, and Southeast regions of Turkey. An indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to screen serum samples collected from slaughterhouse animals between 2006 and 2013. The overall seroprevalence was 335/1362 (24.5 percent), with 325/816 (39.8 percent), 5/307 (1.6 percent), 3/109 (2.8 percent), and 2/130 (1.5 percent) recorded in cattle, sheep, goats, and Anatolian water buffalo, respectively. This is the 1st study to demonstrate the presence of antibodies to SBV in Turkish ruminants; it indicates that cattle are more susceptible to infection than sheep, goats, or buffalo and that exposure of domestic ruminants to SBV in Turkey may have occurred up to 5 years prior to the 1st recorded outbreak of the disease in 2011.

[The significantly lower rate of seropositive sheep and goats may indeed reflect higher susceptibility of cattle. However, other factors deserve to be taken into consideration, such as the altitudes at which those animals of different species were held or were grazing. Such conditions may have significantly influenced their potential exposure to vectors. In the described surveillance, based upon slaughterhouse sampling, the background of the sampled animals is not known/registered.

The paper includes a map showing the 8 locations throughout Turkey where samples were collected for testing (in fact, these are slaughterhouses).

In the discussion chapter, the authors state: "A concern was that the commercial kit employed may detect the antibodies against other Simbu serogroup viruses besides SBV. However, company staff tested a number of Rift Valley fever-positive and Akabane-positive sera on the "IDvet" SBV ELISA, and all sera were found negative (personal communication with Anna Lecoq, International Sales Manager). Our laboratory does not have live virus to perform virus neutralization tests. We planned to collect from wide areas in Turkey and from different periods and to do the virus isolation and/or the specific nucleotide sequence detection in the future."

Rift Valley fever is, like SBV, a member of the family Bunyaviridae but belongs to a different genus, Phlebovirus. Its very different clinical manifestations and the fact that it has never been suspected in Turkey or in its neighbors makes its candidacy for inclusion in a differential diagnosis list rather remote. However, the situation is different in relation to Akabane virus, which belongs to the same serogroup as SBV, namely the Simbu serogroup. This virus has been reported from several Middle Eastern countries in the past, including Turkey. There are also other candidates in this serogroup (e.g. Aino).

In view of the impact of their findings, in particular the proposed time-line, have the authors considered submitting samples from animals, found positive by the commercial kit, for confirmation in one of the laboratories specifically experienced with SBV, such as FLI (Germany)? - Mod.AS
