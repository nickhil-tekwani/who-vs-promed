A meningitis epidemic that has claimed 1625 lives in the impoverished
west African nation of Burkina Faso since January 2007 has slowed,
the health ministry said on Thu 26 Apr 2007.
"The situation as of 18 Apr 2007 is the following: there have been a
total of 24 633 cases recorded and the number of deaths is 1625,"
said a report from the national committee managing the fight against
the disease. It also said that the epidemic was active in 6 districts
as opposed to 30 a month earlier [March 2007], and the death rate had
dropped from 8 percent in March 2007 to 6.6 percent so far in April
2007.
Meningitis is still plaguing the northern regions of Dori and
Gorom-Gorom, central Yako, and Sapouy in the south, and Kongoussi in
the east but the capital Ouagadougou has been taken off the list of
epidemic-hit zones, the report said.
Although Burkina Faso has by far the largest number of cases, Benin,
Chad, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, and Togo have also
been affected to differing degrees.

From 1 Jan to 8 Apr 2007, a total of 11 786 meningitis cases and 704
deaths have been reported in southern Sudan. In northern Sudan 775
cases and 43 deaths had been reported as of 17 Apr 2007. In total, 46
counties in 16 states of Sudan have so far been affected.
In response to the high rate of mortality as a result of the
epidemic, the Sudanese Red Crescent (SRC) and the International
Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) has
combined forces with Partner National Societies (PNSs), national
authorities, and United Nations (UN) agencies to promote a 3-month
intervention program focusing on vaccinations, assistance for
treatment in hospitals and health centres, a community education and
awareness campaign, as well as health education for SRC volunteers.
