[This outbreak is at a location identical to that in 2018; see 26 May 2018 Anthrax - Myanmar (02): (SA) bovine, OIE 20180526.5821050. So one can presume that it is a repeat outbreak thanks to a failure in vaccinating to protect livestock after the previous outbreak and this spring (2019) along with either a contaminated source, grazing, or feed. The carcasses of the previous outbreak appear to have been neither buried nor burnt; see in the post cited above, "The farmer (owner) and colleagues did not bury the carcasses but consumed the meat of died cattle and buffaloes." - Mod.MHJ
