At least 12 new cases of hepatitis E virus have been reported in
Pader District, a top official of a taskforce instituted to eliminate
the disease in the district has confirmed. Mr Charles Kulwa told the
Daily Monitor on Friday [6 Mar 2009] the outbreak was first reported
on 21 Feb 2009. "There are 12 persons that are suspected to have
hepatitis E, according to their symptoms," he said. Mr Kulwa said the
affected persons are from Pajule in Kibong village were 5 cases have
been reported; 2 other cases were in Payimol; 2 in Acholi bur; Lapul
village had 2; and one person in Awere. All the cases are of school children.

He added that they are not leaving anything to chance in the fight
against the epidemic. "The task force, is on the ground to sensitise
people on hygiene in their areas of return [resettlement?] and in the
camps," Mr Kulwa said. Sanitation in the district is worrying as only
22 per cent of the families have toilets. The rest ease themselves in
bushes and this explains the continued contamination of water points
in the district.

Hepatitis E is a waterborne disease. The health inspector in charge
of Aruu County, Ms Ruth Among, said blood samples where taken to
Kampala on Thursday [5 Mar 2009] for tests. "While we are waiting for
the results from the samples, we are treating these people because
they have all the symptoms of persons with hepatitis E," she said.
The disease has found a safe ground in northern Uganda. In the 1st 4
weeks of this year [2009], Kitgum District had 53 cases.

The cumulative number of hepatitis E cases to date [9 Mar 2009]
stands at 128 since the epidemic was first reported on 21 May 2008.
