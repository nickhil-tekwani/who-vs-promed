Mystery disease kills 24 in north India
---------------------------------------
A mystery disease has killed at least 24 people, and affected about 50
others, in a village in Uttar Pradesh state, in north India, the Indo-Asian
News Service (IANS) reported on Monday [20 Sep 2004].
At least 50 people from the village in Sitapur district have been admitted
to hospital with high fever and shivering, followed by dysentery and
vomiting. The deaths have occurred over the past month.
"We have urged the government to send specialists from Lucknow to carry out
clinical and pathological investigations to diagnose the disease so that
appropriate treatment can be administered," IANS quoted Sitapur district
magistrate Amod Kumar as saying. Kumar, who visited the village on Sunday
[19 Sep 2004], said that "the local doctors are doing their best to save
the lives of the affected people. But, unless the killer disease can be
identified, the exact treatment will not be possible." He did not rule out
the possibility of more people falling prey to the mysterious virus.

24 die of mysterious disease in UP village
------------------------------------------
A mysterious illness in Gurdhapa village, in the Sitapur district of Uttar
Pradesh, has claimed more than 2 dozen lives within one week. Over 50
others are suffering from the disease in the village of just 900 people.
Sources said that many villagers started suffering from shivering, along
with high fever, followed by dysentery and vomiting.
According to the village pradhan, lives couldn't be saved, as the
government hospital was quite far, and the disease did not give enough time
to the relatives of the victims to take them to the hospital.
On Saturday [18 Sep 2004], District Magistrate Amod Kumar, along with the
deputy chief medical officer, visited the village with a team of doctors
from Mahmudabad. The doctors will conduct a study, and, assist the affected
the villagers. The district magistrate also gave assurances that he would
summon health teams from Lucknow to diagnose and treat the disease.

[The clinical picture described above is consistent with a fairly extensive
differential diagnosis; while the 1st newswire seems to implicate a
"virus", many of the diseases on the differential diagnosis list are
bacterial in origin. If the numbers given above are correct, about 5 per
cent of the population of the village were ill during either the past month
or the past week (depending upon which newswire one reads) and, of those
affected by the illness, there was a 48 per cent case fatality rate. Rather
than speculate, this moderator is requesting more information on this
outbreak from knowledgeable sources in India, as we have done many times
before. - Mod.MPP]
