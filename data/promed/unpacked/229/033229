[The detection of the outbreak might have been during its early
stages; the intervention of the authorities seems timely and
effective. It remains hopeful that eradication has been achieved and
that no additional foci of FMD occur in the Amur region. This
depends, to a certain extent, upon measures undertaken in China to
control the Asia 1 spread there. - Mod.AS]
