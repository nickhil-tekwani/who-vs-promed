As of 28 Oct 2015, 410 cases of whooping cough have been reported in El Sereif Beni Hussein locality, according to the Sudanese Ministry of Health (SMoH). The outbreak started in early September 2015 and has affected all age groups including infants, children and adults. No deaths have been reported so far, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported in its latest weekly bulletin.

Out of the 14 samples collected, 4 tested positive for whooping cough (pertussis). About half (193) of all cases have been reported in the El Hariga village where the outbreak started. The remaining cases are from 8 neighboring villages. The majority of cases are of people under 15 years of age.

In response, the SMoH, WHO, and health partners on the ground are implementing a 3-month action plan in the locality. MoH and WHO teams have been deployed to the locality to assist in the response activities. Medecins Sans Frontieres Spain (MSF-Spain) has initiated case management and community awareness-raising activities.

Between 17-22 Oct 2015, the MoH vaccinated more than 16 600 children under 5 years. The rate of transmission seems to be decreasing, according to WHO.
