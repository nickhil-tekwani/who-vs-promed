Victorian egg farm Farm Pride Foods (ASX: FRM) has confirmed the loss of a third of its productive hen flock due to outbreaks of bird flu impacting 2 farm facilities in the Lethbridge area.

The company 1st confirmed an outbreak of the H7N7 (HPAI) avian influenza virus at a Lethbridge farm 2 weeks ago, announcing its livestock would be depopulated in line with AUSVETPLAN, a nationally agreed-upon strategy for the response of emergency animal disease incidents in Australia. In a statement today [Wed 26 Aug 2020], Farm Pride confirmed a 2nd farm, a free-range operation housing 40 000 hens, has been affected by the virus, and Agriculture Victoria (Ag Vic) has issued a destruction order to cull all livestock on site. As a result of the outbreaks, the total number of layer (egg-laying) hens lost -- including cage, free range, and barn -- now stands at 380 000, representing about 33% of Farm Pride's productive hen flock.

In today's [Wed 26 Aug 2020] statement, Farm Pride said the latest outbreak has occurred "despite strict monitoring and controls having prohibited the movement of birds, equipment, and products within and out of restricted areas and this farm. It is disappointing, despite the highest biosecurity levels and efforts of the farm management and Ag Vic, that this site has now succumbed to the virus. The AI H7N7 virus is a particularly virulent and aggressive strain." Farm Pride said it continues to work closely with Agriculture Victoria to "ensure compliance with all restricted and control area orders".

From 7 Aug [2020], Victoria's chief veterinary officer Dr Graeme Cooke issued a housing of livestock clause for 30 days legally requiring all poultry owners within the state's Golden Plains Shire restricted and control area to keep their birds enclosed. This even includes those with just 2 or 3 chickens or birds.

The order came after the H7N7 avian influenza virus was detected at a free-range egg farm near Lethbridge, just outside of Geelong, on 31 Jul [2020], and a 2nd farm was confirmed to have the virus on 6 Aug [2020]. The 2nd farm appears to be Farm Pride's facility, as indicated in its 10 Aug [2020] announcement.

In addition, a turkey farm near Bairnsdale in East Gippsland was found to have the low pathogenic strain H5N2 (LPAI) on 10 Aug [2020].

"Work is now under way to thoroughly decontaminate all sites to ensure all remnants of the virus are eliminated," Ag Vic stated. "While this is an important milestone as part of eradication efforts, it does not mean the threat is over." Victoria's health department confirmed the H7N7 and H5N2 strains of bird flu are "not a risk to the public as they rarely affect humans unless there is direct and close contact with sick birds. There are no food safety issues identified; properly cooked chicken meat and eggs are safe to eat," it stated.

While there is a level of uncertainty regarding the extent and duration of the outbreak and its consequences, the company has forecast a reduction in full-year FY21 net revenue of between AUD 18-23 million [USD 13-16.6 million]. "Recovery strategies are already being implemented, and the company acknowledges the support of all of its stakeholders, especially our customers and staff," it said. It confirmed all other company operations remain unaffected by the bird flu issue, and operations are continuing as normal across all other parts of the business.

[Victoria now has both low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI).

With both forms of AI in the same state, biosecurity must be at the top of every operations activity. Biosecurity is not a catch phrase; it is a serious term used to mean disinfect everything possibly having come into contact with infected material. This includes vehicles, vehicle tires, boots, coveralls, the outside of feed sacks, hands, etc.

Between 1976 and 1997, 7 outbreaks of HPAI occurred in Australia. HPAI viruses caused clinical disease in commercial poultry in Victoria in 1976 (H7N7), 1985 (H7N7), and 1992 (H7N3); in Queensland in 1994 (H7N3); and in New South Wales in 1997 (H7N4), 2012 (H7N7), and 2013 (H7N2). Each time, there was severe disease in affected chicken flocks. All had obvious or circumstantial evidence of contact with wild waterfowl or surface water contaminated by wild waterfowl, or with free-range farmed ducks. There is some evidence that, initially, low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) may have been involved in the outbreaks in 1976, 1992, and 1997 (Selleck, et al. 2003).
