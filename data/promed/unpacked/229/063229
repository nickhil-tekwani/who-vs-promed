ASF outbreak reported in Mpumalanga
-----------------------------------
Dr Bothle Michael Modisane, chief director of the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Animal Production and Health, has reported an outbreak of African swine fever [ASF] at a farm in Mpumalanga province.

The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) received an immediate notification on Fri 13 Jan 2012. According to the report, pigs were also found to be sick at an abattoir in Gauteng. There are no pigs left on the farm, and the abattoir is also empty.

A total of 80 pigs were found susceptible to the outbreak, out of which 35 cases were identified. A total of 28 deaths were recorded, and the remaining 52 animals were destroyed.

The source of the outbreak remains inconclusive. However, it has been discovered that the outbreak occurred outside South Africa's ASF control zone. The source of the outbreak is under investigation.
