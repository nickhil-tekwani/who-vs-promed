Ebola in DRC: Outbreak total rises to 121

Since our last report on the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in Equateur Province in western Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) on 6 Sep 2020, an additional 9 total EVD cases have been reported; this includes one on 9 Sep, 5 on 10 Sep, and 3 on 11 Sep 2020.

This brings the outbreak total to 121 (115 confirmed and 6 probable cases). 53 people have recovered, and 48 total deaths (including 42 confirmed and 6 probable) have been reported.

39 health areas have been affected from 12 health zones.

New response teams left on Fri 11 Sep 2020 in the Bomongo health zone in order to strengthen the response activities currently underway in the Buburu health area, on the border with the Republic of Congo.

28 217 people have been vaccinated since the beginning of the outbreak.

On 1 Jun 2020, this 11th EVD outbreak in DRC was declared. Equateur province experienced its last Ebola epidemic 2 years ago, between May and July 2018.

#Ebola: 3 new cases in the Equateur outbreak in western DRC [1 in Bontele, 2 in Lotumbe]. That makes 8 new cases reported in the past 2 days. It had looked for a bit like this outbreak was slowing down; the opposite seems now to be true. Not good. There've been a total of 121 cases & 48 deaths so far.

#Ebola: Had looked like the growth in cases in the Equateur outbreak in DRC was slowing. But there were 5 new cases yesterday [10 Sep 2020], spread across 3 health zones. Not good. Outbreak totals: 118 cases, 48 deaths.

Five more sick in DRC's latest Ebola outbreak; total at 118 cases

A spurt of 5 new cases were reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) Equateur province outbreak, boosting the total to 118 [note 121 now], the World Health Organization (WHO) African regional office said in an update on Twitter today [11 Sep 2020].

No new deaths were reported, keeping the fatality count at 48.

The outbreak is the country's 11th involving Ebola and is occurring in the same area where the DRC's 9th outbreak took place in 2018, sickening 54 people and leading to 33 deaths.

Health officials are concerned about the new outbreak, as outbreak responders also grapple with COVID-19 amid scarce resources. In addition, illnesses are occurring across a broad area, some difficult to access, and some patients with confirmed infections have remained in the community, posing a high risk of further spread.

Ebola is spreading in a western province in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), raising fears that the disease could reach neighbouring Republic of Congo and even the capital, Kinshasa, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Fri 11 Sep 2020.

The outbreak in Equateur Province emerged in early June 2020 and has now spread into another of its 17 health zones, bringing the total number of affected zones to 12. So far, there have been 113 cases and 48 deaths [see updated numbers in 1st post above].

"The most recently affected area, Bomongo, is the 2nd affected health zone that borders the Republic of Congo, which heightens the chances of this outbreak to spread into another country," said WHO Spokesperson, Fadela Chaib, underlining the need for cross-border collaboration and coordination.

The risk of the disease spreading as far as Kinshasa is also a very real concern for the UN agency. One of the affected areas, Mbandaka, is connected to the capital by a busy river route used by thousands every week.

This is the 2nd Ebola outbreak in Equateur Province and the 11th overall in the DRC, which recently defeated the disease in its volatile eastern region after a 2-year battle.

This latest western outbreak 1st surfaced in the city of Mbandaka, home to more than one million people, and subsequently spread to 11 health zones, with active transmission currently occurring in 8.

The health zones all border each other and cover a large and remote area often only accessible by helicopter or boat.

Managing response logistics in Equateur is difficult as communities are very scattered. Many are in deeply forested areas, and reaching them requires travelling long distances.

In some areas, community resistance is also a challenge, Ms. Chaib added.

"We learned over years of working on Ebola in DRC how important it is to engage and mobilize communities. WHO is working with UNICEF in engaging religious, youth, and community leaders to raise awareness about Ebola," she said.

The situation has been further complicated by a health worker strike that has affected key response activities for nearly 4 weeks. Locally based Ebola responders have been protesting against low salaries as well as non-payment since the start of the outbreak.

Although some activities have resumed, many are still on hold, making it difficult to get an accurate picture of how the epidemic is evolving and which areas need the most attention.

WHO and partners have been on the ground since the early days of the outbreak. More than 90 experts are in Equateur, and additional staff have recently been deployed from the capital, including experts in epidemiology, vaccination, community engagement, infection prevention and control, laboratory, and treatment.

Nearly one million travellers have been screened, which helped identify some 72 suspected Ebola cases, thus reducing further spread. However, the UN agency warned that response is "grossly underfunded." WHO has provided some USD 2.3 million in support so far and has urged donors to back a USD 40 million plan by the Congolese government.

This latest Ebola outbreak is unfolding amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. As of Fri [11 Sep 2020], there were more than 10 300 cases and 260 deaths across the vast African nation.

While there are several similarities in addressing the 2 diseases, such as the need to identify and test contacts, isolate cases, and promote effective prevention measures, Ms. Chaib stressed that, without extra funding, it will be even harder to defeat Ebola.

[The case numbers are increasing and are likely an underestimate, which is generally the case in outbreaks, a result of health care worker strikes and the remoteness of the region. These factors, along with insufficient funding, are contributing to the problem and increase concern over expansion into a major public health threat. Fortunately, experts have been deployed to the region, but COVID-19 exacerbates the response.

Vaccination will help control Ebola, and contact tracing and case isolation will help control spread of both Ebola and SARS-CoV-2, but the health care system is also challenged with addressing HIV, malaria, typhoid, polio, cholera, TB, and more, increasing the challenge to the country.

The DRC recently reported 15 more cases of vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2), including 13 in Equateur province where the Ebola outbreak is underway and one each in Kinshasa and Mai Ndombe provinces, putting the country's 2020 total at 41. - Mod.LK
