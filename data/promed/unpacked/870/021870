Unknown Virus May Behind High Mortality Rate in Luanda Hospital
------------------------------------------------------------
An unknown virus might be a cause of the high mortality rate at the Neves
Bendinha Burn Injuries Hospital here, Angolan newspapers Friday quoted Neto
Monteiro, clinical director of the hospital as saying. He did not specify
what kind of virus is involved and said his hospital does not have the
resources to detect the killer virus. The hospital in question was opened 10
years ago and has never been disinfected, said Neto Monteiro, saying
disinfecting should be done at least twice a year. He called for the
renovation of the hospital to reduce the daunting death rate.
In the coastal strip of this southwest African country, home to over one
third of the country's 12 million population, where the hospital is located,
fatal diseases like malaria are rampant.

[ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving more information on this reportedly
high mortality rate. Is this a new event (such as an outbreak of an unknown
disease with a high mortality rate), or is it an ongoing problem with a high
nosocomial infection rate associated with a high mortality rate (more likely
to be bacterial in origin than viral as stated in the above report)? -Mod.
