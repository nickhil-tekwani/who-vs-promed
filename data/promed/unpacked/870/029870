DR Congo's last Ebola patient discharged, says WHO

The last Ebola patient in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has been discharged from a medical facility in the country's northeast, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced on Fri [15 May 2020].

In a tweet, the WHO Regional Office for Africa said the patient was released from a treatment center in Beni, referring to the city in North Kivu province as the "last remaining Ebola hotspot" in the country.

"Response teams will remain on the ground in full response mode for the rest of the 42-day observation period," read the WHO African Region tweet, which included a video of jubilant medics celebrating the patient's recovery.

WHO Regional Director for Africa Dr. Matshidiso Moeti also confirmed the "positive" development in a separate tweet.

"Yesterday [15 May 2020], the last Ebola patient was released in Beni, the only remaining Ebola hotspot in DRC. I am encouraged by this positive news & hope that we will soon finally bring this outbreak to an end," she said.

The WHO set up Ebola vaccination centers in Beni last month [April 2020], following a resurgence in cases and virus-linked deaths.

At the time, the WHO Africa office said efforts were focused on vaccinating all contacts of possible Ebola patients "to break the chain of transmission within the community."

[WHO Disease Outbreak News (abridged, edited)]
https://www.who.int/csr/don/07-May-2020-ebola-drc/en/

Ebola virus disease DR Congo situation as at 7 May 2020. No new cases reported from North Kivu Province

From 29 Apr to 5 May 2020, no new cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) have been reported from North Kivu Province, Democratic Republic of the Congo (Figure 1). Since the resurgence of the outbreak on 10 Apr 2020, 7 confirmed cases have been reported from Kasanga, Malepe and Kanzulinzuli Health Areas in Beni Health Zone. Of these, one is receiving care at the Beni Ebola treatment centre (ETC); one who was receiving care at the ETC recovered and was discharged, and one remains in the community. Four of the people confirmed to have Ebola died, including 2 community deaths and 2 deaths in the ETC in Beni. A total of 1137 people have been vaccinated in Beni and Karisimbi since 10 Apr 2020.

Specimens from all confirmed cases were sent to the Institut Research Biomedicale (INRB) for genetic sequencing to support the investigation of the source of infection. Laboratory sequencing of the virus showed that all 7 cases were linked to the same chain confirmed in July 2019, suggesting exposure to a persistent source of infection. Individuals in the current cluster may have been infected by direct contact with body fluids of a survivor (asymptomatic or relapse case). Investigations into the transmission chains from July 2019 in Beni and Katwa Health Zones and the confirmed cases reported in Beni Health Zone in April 2020 are ongoing. The origin of this cluster of cases is yet to be confirmed.

Surveillance performance has remained at a similar level compared to last week, although alert rates remain suboptimal. A total of 1102 contacts of the 7 recent confirmed cases have been registered to date. On 5 May 2020, of the 449 identified contacts to be followed, 438 (98%) were seen; 123 (27%) were high risk contacts who had direct contact with body fluids of confirmed cases. As of 5 May 2020, 19 (15%) of the 123 high risk contacts of confirmed cases have been offered accommodation in a dedicated facility where they are provided with food and other essential goods, to allow for closer monitoring and prompt isolation and provision of care to those who might become symptomatic.

From 29 Apr - 5 May 2020, an average of 2260 alerts were reported per day, of which 2252 were investigated within 24 hours. Of these, an average of 298 alerts were validated as suspected cases each day, requiring specialized care and laboratory testing to rule out EVD. From 27 Apr to 3 May 2020, 2113 samples were tested, including 1466 blood samples from alive, suspected cases; 308 swabs from community deaths; and 339 samples from re-tested patients. Overall, laboratory activities increased by 37% compared to the previous week.

As of 5 May 2020, a total of 3462 EVD cases, including 3317 confirmed and 145 probable cases, have been reported, of which 2279 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 66%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 57% (n=1970) were female, 29% (n=1002) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (n=171) were health care workers. As of 5 May 2020, a total of 1170 cases have recovered from EVD.

It is critical to detect, isolate, test and treat new suspected cases as early as possible in order increase the chances of survival of those infected, and to break the chain of transmission. Outbreak response teams face a number of challenges, including limited resources because of other local and global emergencies, and the presence of armed groups which limits access to some communities. A major funding gap is also constraining the response. WHO currently requires USD 21.5 million to ensure continuity of essential response activities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Study confirms risks of breastfeeding to infants of moms with Ebola
---------------------
A systematic review published yesterday [6 May 2020] in The Lancet Infectious Diseases underscores the importance of precautions to minimize the risk of transmitting Ebola via breastfeeding.

Led by World Health Organization (WHO) researchers, the review of 52 studies published from 1976-2019 found that Ebola virus was still detectable via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in breast milk 26 days after the mother began having symptoms and in amniotic fluid as long as 32 days after the virus had cleared from the mother's blood.

Of 274 pregnant women with Ebola, 197 (72%) died, similar to the death rate of the general population infected with the virus. Almost all the women had adverse pregnancy outcomes, with only 31 of 267 (12%) resulting in a live birth and all but 3 babies dying within 19 days. Maternal death rates from Ebola before 2014 were higher (91 of 107 cases [85%]).

The 2019 outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is ongoing, with 3453 cases and 2264 deaths as of 5 Apr 2020. Most cases have occurred in women, as they did in the 2014-16 outbreak in West Africa that killed more than 11 000 people.

Some pregnant women were denied supportive care in the 2014-16 outbreak because healthcare workers thought treatment was futile. "Our review, however, suggests that pregnancy is not associated with increased mortality or disease severity for women with Ebola virus disease," the authors wrote.

In a commentary in the same journal on WHO guidelines on the care of pregnant or breastfeeding women with Ebola issued in February 2020, the same authors said that breastfeeding infants of infected mothers should be separated and given a breast milk substitute and should be considered contacts for the purposes of outbreak management.

Summary. The outbreaks of Ebola virus between 2014 and 2020 have drawn attention to knowledge gaps related to Ebola virus disease in pregnant women. The aim of this study was to systematically evaluate available data on pregnant and lactating women with acute Ebola virus disease or following recovery. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library (CENTRAL), Web of Science Core Collection, CINAHL, POPLINE, Global Health, and WHO Global Index Medicus, in addition to grey literature, for relevant articles. Studies of all types and published between database inception and Aug 19, 2019, were eligible (PROSPERO 129335). We identified 1060 records, of which 52 studies met our inclusion criteria.

New WHO guidelines on the management of pregnancy and breastfeeding in the context of Ebola. Lancet Infectious Diseases Published: 06 May 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30375-3

Labour should not be induced, and invasive procedures should not be done for fetal indications in pregnant women with acute Ebola virus disease. These procedures might pose an unnecessary risk to women and further the risk of transmission of Ebola virus to health-care workers while benefits have not been shown. The natural course of untreated Ebola virus disease in pregnancy is associated with a near 100% fetal or neonatal mortality. With advances in therapeutics and care, this recommendation might need revision, providing proof of principle.

All pregnant women with acute Ebola virus disease should be cared for by use of both standard and Ebola-specific infection prevention and control measures, and all pregnant women who have recovered from Ebola virus disease (and who conceived before having Ebola virus disease) should be enabled and encouraged to attend frequent antenatal care. If there is no risk of exposure to pregnancy-related fluids during the visit, only standard precautions are required. Childbirth and pregnancy complications should be managed at Ebola treatment centres and Ebola virus infection prevention and control measures should be used in addition to standard precautions. Among women who become pregnant after resolved acute Ebola virus disease, standard infection prevention and control precautions should be used.

After recovery from Ebola virus disease, WHO suggests that pregnant women receive counselling and information on infection prevention and control and pregnancy management by provision of respectful care and the observation of women's choices in pregnancy continuation or safe abortion to the full extent of the law.

Surgically removing fetal tissue from the uterus following maternal demise from Ebola virus disease (occasionally termed post-mortem caesarean) might pose a risk of transmission to contacts and should be strongly discouraged. Burial ceremonies, such as those that engage in the practice of separating fetal tissue from the uterus following maternal demise, are culturally important in some communities. WHO suggests that principles on how to have safe and dignified burials be adapted to consider pregnant women who have died from Ebola virus disease, with careful consideration for cultural and religious values.

Breastfeeding should be stopped if acute Ebola virus disease is suspected or confirmed in a lactating woman or in a breastfeeding child. The child should be separated from the breastfeeding woman and provided an age-appropriate breastmilk substitute as needed. Children who are exposed to breastmilk should be considered contacts. We have already presented further details on Ebola virus disease and breastfeeding and conditional exceptions when breastfeeding can be continued.

Pregnant and breastfeeding women in affected areas should be offered vaccination with the prequalified, live, replicating recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus-Zaire Ebola virus-envelope glycoprotein vaccine (known as rVSV-ZEBOV-GP or Ervebo) during an active outbreak of Zaire ebolavirus, in the context of rigorous research or in accordance with a compassionate use protocol. Vaccination should occur with informed consent and in compliance with good clinical practice.

Given the high maternal and perinatal mortality associated with acute Ebola virus disease and the high vaccine efficacy, Ervebo should be offered to pregnant and breastfeeding women. Data should be collected on pregnancy outcomes and adverse events, and safety and efficacy data should be periodically evaluated to inform subsequent recommendations.

These recommendations are to be included in Ebola epidemic preparedness and response. Target audiences include policy makers, health-care providers, and emergency response teams. The complete guideline further outlines considerations for implementation, including how obstetric care can be provided safely in an Ebola treatment centre. The guidelines also include research questions that highlight the remaining evidence gaps related to pregnant and breastfeeding women with Ebola.

Telehealth tools developed for Ebola improve COVID-19 care
----
Telemedicine tools developed at UVA Health to battle Ebola have huge potential in the fight against COVID-19, UVA experts report in a new scientific paper. The tools, they say, allow doctors to provide personal, high-quality care while conserving vital personal protective equipment and reducing infection risks.

The battle against highly contagious diseases represents an important new application for the technology, which has traditionally been used to expand access to healthcare and spare patients the need to travel to see doctors and specialists. Other hospitals and healthcare facilities, the UVA experts believe, can benefit from embracing the potential of telemedicine to enhance care for patients with COVID-19 and other highly infectious illnesses.

"One of the few bright spots of the COVID-19 crisis is that it's shown us how remarkably powerful and versatile telemedicine can be during outbreaks of novel contagious diseases," said UVA Health epidemiologist Costi Sifri, MD. "Its importance in helping us care for patients in their home while sheltering-in-place is clear. What we show here is that telemedicine solutions can also be used within the walls of hospitals, emergency rooms and clinics to help provide enhanced, more efficient and safer patient care for those potentially infected with high-risk pathogens."

In a new paper published in the Annals of the American Thoracic Society, UVA's epidemiology and telehealth leaders report that iSOCOMS [Isolation Communication Management System] provided "clear benefit" to patient care and healthcare provider safety when ruling out potential Ebola cases. (No cases were found at UVA.) "We were surprised by the number of case-use scenarios that were built around iSOCOMS during Ebola preparedness planning, ranging from PPE use, supervision and support of direct patient care, healthcare worker safety, patient-team member communication, extension of consult health services, patient-family communication, patient-support service communications and trainee education," they write.
