Patients diagnosed with post-COVID conditions
An analysis of private healthcare claims using the official ICD-10 diagnostic code
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
Post-COVID conditions, also known by such terms as long COVID and post-acute sequelae of COVID-19, have become an issue of growing national [This is written from a US perspective, although such sequelae affect people elsewhere. - Mod.SH] concern. Until recently, researchers were limited by the lack of a specific ICD-10 diagnosis code for post-COVID conditions. Effective 1 Oct 2021, ICD-10 code U09.9 was introduced for "post-COVID-19 condition, unspecified". This report is among the first to use the U09.9 code for research purposes. Drawing on longitudinal data from FAIR Health's repository of billions of private healthcare claims, this report studies the population of 78 252 patients in the repository who were diagnosed with the U09.9 code from 1 Oct 2021-31 Jan 2022. That population is analyzed by COVID-19 hospitalizations, age, gender, number of days from initial COVID-19 diagnosis to last post-COVID diagnosis during the study period, preexisting chronic comorbidities, co-occurring diagnoses, and risk scores. Among the key findings:
- The majority (75.8 per cent) of patients diagnosed with a U09.9 post-COVID condition had not been hospitalized for COVID-19.
- Among patients who presented with a U09.9 post-COVID diagnosis, 81.6 per cent of females had not had a COVID-19 hospitalization and 67.5 per cent of males.
- The age group 36 to 50 was the most likely to be diagnosed with U09.9 post-COVID conditions; 34.6 per cent of patients with that diagnosis were in that age group.
- Females were more likely than males to be diagnosed with U09.9 post-COVID conditions. Females made up 59.8 per cent of the population of patients with that diagnosis, while males made up 40.2 per cent. By comparison, within the cohort of people diagnosed with COVID-19 in the FAIR Health repository, 53.8 per cent of patients were female and 46.2 per cent were male.
- Of patients who presented with a U09.9 post-COVID condition, 30.7 per cent had no identified preexisting chronic comorbidities.
- The 3 diagnoses most commonly co-occurring on the same claim line with the U09.9 post-COVID diagnosis in patients across all ages and genders were abnormalities of breathing (23.2 per cent of patients with post-COVID conditions), cough (18.9 per cent), and malaise and fatigue (16.7 per cent).
- In patients with a U09.9 post-COVID diagnosis, certain co-occurring diagnoses were more common in some age groups than across all age groups: for example, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in patients aged 0-12; abnormalities of heartbeat in the age group 13-22; generalized anxiety disorder in patients aged 23-35; and hypertensive diseases in the age group 65 and older.
- "Other and unspecified myopathies" (diseases that affect the muscles that control voluntary movement) occurred in patients in the post-COVID population 11.1 times more often than in the same population prior to COVID-19. Pulmonary embolism occurred 2.6 times more often. "Other disorders of the brain," including post-viral fatigue syndrome and certain forms of encephalopathy, occurred two times more often.
- On average, in all age groups, patients with a U09.9 post-COVID condition had higher Department of Health & Human Services-Hierarchical Condition Category (HHS-HCC) risk scores after their diagnosis of COVID-19 than before. HHS-HCC risk scores identify which patients are likely to consume more healthcare resources and potentially incur more healthcare-related costs in the long run.

[In the past 24 hours, 12 countries -- North Korea (262 280), USA (219 259), Taiwan (85 082), Germany (64 582), Australia (53 139), Japan (33 734), Italy (30 927), France (29 995), South Korea (28 105), Ireland (16 384), Brazil (13 525), and Costa Rica (11 369) -- all reported over 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 2168 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 17 May 2022 to late 18 May 2022).

A total of 29 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 11 of the 29 countries are from the European region, 6 are from the Americas region, 0 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 8 are from the Western Pacific region, 3 from the South East Asia region, and 1 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 57.5%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 0.21%. Comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 23.8% increase in daily reported cases and a 0.04% increase in reported deaths. There is an overall global trend of decreasing cases and deaths.

Impression: Worldwide over 0.94 million newly confirmed infections were reported in the past 24 hours. The cumulative totals exceed 525.03 million reported cases and 6.29 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
