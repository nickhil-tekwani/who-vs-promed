ROSS RIVER FEVER: DIAGNOSIS: REQUEST FOR INFO
=============================================
I received a call from a ship at sea that recently visited Australia. The
doctor aboard is treating a patient with the presumptive diagnosis of Ross
River fever and would like to confirm the diagnosis, if possible. What
specimens are required and where should they be sent? Thanks for
considering this request.
