The Secretariat of Public Health announced that the first 5 cases of
classical dengue have occurred in the state of Sonora so far this year [2009].

The head of the state organization, Raymundo Lopez Vucovich, said
that 4 [dengue] cases have been confirmed in Alamos municipality,
while the 5th has been reported in the border city of Nogales.

This official noted that this last case was imported from Bolivia, to
where the person who became ill had traveled recently and where
he/she contracted the disease.

He advised that the community must not rely on the low temperatures
that have been recorded, [because] even with weather changes the
vector mosquitoes _Aedes aegypti_, that transmit the illness [virus],
have maintained their presence.

He announced that the 5 people affected by classical dengue are in
the process of recovery and are out of danger.

Lopez Vucovich called for the population to maintain the patios of
their houses clean and continue with the strategy "operation everyone
against dengue", to avoid the proliferation of the insect [mosquito].

Dengue is an infectious disease, which in its benign form
incapacitates the patient for an average of 15 days. However, it can
generate cases of hemorrhagic dengue fever [DHF] with a high risk of
death. [Individuals suffering from classical dengue fever, "breakbone
fever," might not agree that the infection is benign. - Mod.TY]

[Some may say that 5 cases do not signify anything, but we must not
ignore that they are in winter in Mexico, and the temperature in
Hermosillo, in Sonora state, varies from minus 10 deg C (14 deg F) to
about 30 deg C (86 deg F), sufficient for the survival of _Ae.
aegypti_, but far from ideal for them. - Mod.LJS

Some 400 dengue cases have been recorded by the health authorities so
far this year [2009], an increase of more than 100 compared to the
same date last year [2008].

The previous [information] was issued by the vice minister of health,
Nerza Paz, who acknowledged that the work to combat the DHF mosquito
vector must be intensified in order to reduce the incidence of affected people.

"We have an increase in dengue cases over last year [2008] at this
date because we have seen an increase of more then 50, about 100, and
this has put us on alert," said Paz.

The official indicated that to confront this disease, they have made
20 million Lempiras [USD 1 058 117] available plus the help of
materials and equipment from the Mexican government.

However, the officials assigned to the fight against _Aedes aegypti_
are absent from the Secretariat of Health because the chief of the
program was dismissed and the metropolitan regional director of
health was suspended. These officials in recent years were those who
undertook a fierce fight, day and night, to control the [dengue]
epidemic, but now it is not known who is in charge of this task.

The most recent data indicate that the disease has affected 400
people of which 22 are suspected DHF [cases] and the rest are
classical dengue with one death.

The Bolivian government on Thursday [29 Jan 2009] acknowledged that
an epidemic of dengue fever is raging "out of control" in the Andean nation.

The Health Ministry announced that the number of people infected with
dengue has risen to 6699 so far this month [February 2009], while the
total of those with the often deadly hemorrhagic version of the
disease has been 11, of whom at least 4 have died.

Despite the fact that the press has been speaking of 5 deaths, to
date only 4 have been confirmed, the head of epidemiology at the
Health Ministry, Juan Carlos Arraya, told Efe.

"The situation is out of control, but the government never stopped
paying attention," health minister Ramiro Tapia said in the eastern
city of Santa Cruz, capital of the like-named province where the
epidemic is concentrated.

Next weekend [7-8 Feb 2009], government entities, along with the
army, will mobilize several social sectors in a campaign to clean up
Santa Cruz city, while in the country fumigation operations will be
undertaken at the foci of the disease, [the virus of] which is spread
by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito.

The symptoms of dengue include high fever, headache, nausea,
vomiting, and skin eruptions, and the hemorrhagic form of dengue is
especially dangerous for the very young and the elderly.

The epidemiology expert for the provincial health service in
Cochabamba, Teddy Penafiel, told Efe that the intense rains during
this time of year have fostered the presence of mosquito breeding
areas, mainly in the poorer communities.

"The control of the breeding areas is the problem. Therefore, we have
to change the habits of the public not to let their homes or
neighborhoods (be converted into) multiple breeding areas," Penafiel said.

"Unfortunately, the public is not cooperating, despite the fact that
fumigation is being done, trash is being collected in some
neighborhoods and homes and they have to have an ongoing clean-up," he said.

Dengue gives up no ground in Cochabamba where 43 patients with dengue
accompanied by hemorrhagic symptoms and 7 with DHF, 2 of whom died,
have been reported. The numbers in January [2009] account for a
reported 519 patients suspected of having dengue in the tropical
areas of Cochabamba [department], according to the chief of the
Departmental [state of province equivalent] Health's Dengue and
Malaria Service Program (SEDES), Arturo Quinones.

There are more than 34 hospitalized [dengue] patients. Of these, 10
are in the Viedma Hospital, 4 with DHF; 10 in the San Francisco de
Asis Hospital of Villa Tunari; 10 in Caja Cordes; 2 in Cossmil; and 2
in the Children's Hospital Manuel Ascencio Villarroel. At least 3 are
diagnosed as critical because they have developed dengue with shock.

SEDES warns that there are 50 000 inhabitants at risk and 30
fumigation brigades must spray with pulverized insecticide [fogging?]
to eliminate adult mosquitoes. On Monday [2 Feb 2009] it is expected
that 15 additional brigades will be added, according to an
announcement by the Mayor's office.

In facing the emergency, the Viedma Hospital is applying an emergency
plan to be able to receive patients, the hospital director Miguel
Tapia indicated.

The Viedma Hospital received the 1st DHF patients on 19 January [2009].

This Friday [30 Jan 2009] the government strengthened the national
campaign against dengue with the shipment of 6 tons of medicines to
the Santa Cruz capital, when the majority of [dengue] cases have been reported.

The minister of health, Ramiro Tapia, announced that the government
promised 8 600 000 bolivianos [USD 1 223 642], of which 4 million
[USD 569 136] will be for Santa Cruz, with the goal of helping people
who have presented with the disease as well as to prevent and
eliminate the proliferation of the insect _Aedes aegypti_, which
transmits dengue [virus].

"The work of our Ministry, of our government, has an obligation that
we have is to move forward to avoid greater propagation of dengue," Tapio said.

This Friday morning [30 Jan 2009], a Hercules aircraft of the
[Bolivian] Air Force arrived at the Viru Viru airport in Santa Cruz
with 6 tons of medicines, of a total of 12 [tons]. Included are 3
tons of water purifiers, 2000 liters of insecticide, 150 sets of
individual equipment for fumigation, 12 000 intravenous fluid units,
150 cots, and 150 mattresses. Additionally, the government sent 40
tents, which together with the cots and mattresses will be placed in
the 3 quarters of Santa Cruz in case the number of patients increases.

Currently, more than 18 000 members of the armed forces are helping
with this national health campaign, reinforced by hundreds of
volunteers dispersed throughout the eastern area and valleys of the country.

Even though the focus of dengue fever is located in the department
[state or province equivalent] of Concepcion, the capital of the
country has high levels of [household _Aedes aegypti_] infestation,
which facilitates the dispersion of the disease [virus]. In the
department of Amambay, the transmission of [dengue] virus has also
been detected, and so the health authorities have warned the citizens
to take extreme measures for the elimination and control of breeding
sites of _Aedes aegypti_.

Some 22.5 percent of the inspected houses in the Santa Maria de la
Asuncion neighborhood had recorded breeding sites with _Aedes
aegypti_ larvae, according to the report issued yesterday [30 Jan
2009] by the National Service for the Control of Diseases Transmitted
by Vectors (Senepa).

Other neighborhoods also had [household infestation indices] at risk
level for dengue virus transmission [the original report cites 4
other neighborhoods with indices ranging from 4.34 to 1.78 percent. - Mod.TY]

The only neighborhood without recorded larval presence was Ytay.

The main breeding sites detected by the [control] brigades consisted
of disposable pails, drums, toilets (covered, not used), bottles,
cans, flowerpot dishes, flower vases with water, and pitchers.

It is considered that to avoid dengue virus transmission, the
[household] infestation indices must be less than 1 percent, while
the number for yellow fever [virus transmission] is less than 5 percent.

In Asuncion, to date [31 Jan 2009], only 5 cases of the disease have
been confirmed, 4 of which were imported from Bolivia.

In the department of Concepcion 69 cases of the disease have been
confirmed, of which 65 are from the Yby Yau locale and 4 from Horqueta.

Also, 5 dengue cases have been recorded in the Pedro Juan Caballero
and Capitan Bado districts of Amambay department.

To date [31 Jan 2009], in [Paraguay], 79 people have been affected by
the disease and there are 229 suspected [dengue] cases in nearly all
departments of the country, with the exception of Caazapa, Misiones,
and Boqueron, according to the report issued by the office of the
Director of Epidemiological Surveillance of the Ministry of Public
Health and Social Welfare.

The health authorities urge people to eliminate all possible vector
mosquito-breeding sites, which are found in sites of clean and
stagnant water. As well, they ask citizens to protect themselves from
bites of this insect [_Ae. aegypti_] by means of physical and
chemical barriers such as bed nets, insect repellants, metal [window]
screens, or clothing with long sleeves. Especially, one should be
careful in situations where many people are gathered.

The Epidemiological Surveillance [unit] of Jequie (359 km [223 mi]
from Salvador) is investigating the death in the early hours of
Wednesday [27 Jan 2009] of a 23-year-old woman an employee of a
medical clinic, who was hospitalized 11 days ago in the Prado
Valadares regional hospital with suspected DHF.

This is the 2nd death this year [2009] of a hospitalized patient
suspected of having the hemorrhagic form of the disease [dengue]. At
the beginning of the month [January 2009], a child of 7 months of age
also died in the hospital.

In this most recent case, the director general of the unit, Gilmar
Vasconcelos, reported that it only fit the municipality
Epidemiological Monitoring [unit criteria] to "unite the serologic
test [results] for dengue with all the clinical information of the
case" to confirm the cause of death.

The director of Epidemiological Monitoring of the Municipal
Department of Health, Brasilino Almeida Junior, said his team also is
verifying the case. "In relation to the death the young woman, she
was discharged after being hospitalized with dengue, but we believe
that her death is not related to this disease [dengue]. Her symptoms
worsened and she returned to hospital, at which time the doctor who
attended her discovered that she had lupus, another condition which
lowers the immunity of a person," he emphasized.

From 4 January [2009] until this Wednesday [27 Jan 2009], the
Surveillance [unit] reported 1941 suspected cases of dengue, of which
541 are [laboratory] confirmed. Among these, more than 70 percent
were recorded in the Joaquim Romao neighborhood and surroundings.

To cope with the disease, the Surveillance unit made available to
community an emergency telephone number. All complaints directed to
this number are checked by a team of epidemic agents equipped with motorcycles.

Also, 74 military firefighters were also trained, from the Jequie
group, to act as epidemic agents in the municipality, in partnership
with Epidemiological Surveillance.

The fight against _Aedes aegypti_, the mosquito transmitting the
disease [virus], is being carried out by 140 agents who make periodic
visits from house to house on several fronts, starting with the 1st
outbreaks that were identified on [20 Nov 2008]. The work includes
the cleaning of canals and removal of trash.

Of the capital cities of the country, 15 are on alert due to dengue.
One of the most critical situations is that of Belo Horizonte, which
may be on the verge of an epidemic.

There was a block full of debris. Tiles, bottles, and even abandoned
vehicles can serve as a reservoir [breeding site] of mosquitoes that
transmit dengue [virus], which reproduce in clean and stagnant water.

A survey done by the municipal Secretariat of Health shows that in 10
buildings in the city, 4 have larvae of the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito,
the transmitter of dengue [virus].

"It is essential to mobilize all citizens within their own house and
also in their neighborhood [to control the mosquito vector], " said
Marcelo Teixeira, municipal Secretary of Health.

Starting this Monday [2 Feb 2009], teams will take turns in
volunteering to stop foci of mosquito [breeding].

Besides Belo Horizonte, another 14 [state] capitals are on alert. The
most critical situations are in Vitoria (Espirito Santo), Salvador
(Bahia), Sao Luis (Maranhao), Recife (Pernambuco), and Rio de
Janeiro, where just in the 1st 20 days of the year [2009], 117
[dengue] cases were reported; 2 deaths are under investigation.

In 2008 there was an outbreak of disease in the state, with 259 000
[dengue] patients and 240 confirmed deaths.

The government of Malaysia today [30 Jan 2009] confronts the worst
dengue epidemic in the history of the country that has already caused
14 deaths and close to 5000 infected [people] this year [2009].

The director general of the Health Ministry, Ismail Merican, told the
press that the number of victims represents almost 3 times those
registered in 2008 when 5 deaths and 2223 infected [individuals] were reported.

Merican called on the citizens to avoid combating the disease with
pesticides that only kill adult mosquitoes but not larvae.

Kuala Lumpur warned that the epidemic threatens the economy of the country.

In the meantime, health authorities relate the growth of the virus
[vector] with strong rainfalls in the last few months that lead to
create wells and swamp lands in residential regions. [_Aedes aegypti_
do not breed in swamp lands. The heavy rains probably have formed new
water catchments in and around houses in which _Ae. aegypti_ breed. - Mod.TY]

Dengue is a febrile viral disease that is transmitted by the mosquito
_Aedes aegypti_ with symptoms that include fever, intense pain in the
muscles and joints and inflammation of the lymphatic glands. Its
hemorrhagic strain is endemic in Southeastern Asia.

The disease spreads in the large cities, above all, due to the
stagnation of water, the favorite [breeding] habitat of the mosquitoes.

Singapore registered more dengue cases in the 1st 3 weeks of January
[2009] over the same period last year [2008], local media reported on
Thursday [29 Jan 2009].

Singapore's National Environment Agency (NEA) said that 509 people
caught dengue fever in the 1st 3 weeks of January [2009], compared to
341 during the same period last year [2008], according to a report by
the Straits Times.

The NEA said it was monitoring whether the increase in cases was
simply due to short-term fluctuations, adding that a surge in the
number of cases in neighboring Malaysia may have an impact on Singapore.

The English [language] newspaper said that Malaysia reported 4221
dengue cases in the 1st 23 days of this month [January 2009], which
almost doubled the figure of the same period last year [2008].

Singapore's key strategy to prevent dengue outbreaks is to keep the
mosquito population low to reduce their chances of transmitting the
disease [virus], the NEA said in the report.
