4 persons have been affected by anthrax in a tribal village of Koraput district [Odisha district]. They are HB 55, SS(1) 45, BK 48, and SS(2) 30, of Lugum in Lamataput block. While BK and SS(?1) are being treated at Lamataput hospital, the other 2 are admitted to a private hospital in Lamataput.

Sources said the affected villagers had killed a sick goat a few days ago and eaten its meat which might have led to the outbreak of the disease. "Patients have abnormal swellings and boils on their body, which are symptoms of anthrax. At present, the situation is under control with teams of doctors and health workers monitoring the situation and visiting the affected village," said chief district medical officer (CDMO) of Koraput Laxmi Dhar Kabi.

The fresh cases of anthrax sparked off a debate on the effectiveness of the administration's strategy to contain the disease. "Each year fresh cases are reported in the district. Vaccination of cattle has not started except in a couple of blocks. The awareness drive against the disease is a non-starter but officers attribute it to the lifestyle of tribals," said Bhabani Mishra, a Koraput based campaigner.

Officials countered that the drive against anthrax was progressing well. "The veterinary department has started vaccination of cattle. Awareness drives have been taken up in rural areas by health officials and voluntary organizations," the CDMO said.

[It is an unfortunate truth of life in India that the Tribals are underserved by their government. And in this instance as these human cases arose from a sick goat, they should also consider caprine vaccination in villages where goats are involved. Goats are browsers. They eat the leaves on the bushes where the blow flies vomit up their blood meal after feeding on a carcass. This is so that they can get rid of the excess fluid in their stomachs and eat the red blood cells in the vomit. In this way blow flies increase the number of anthrax cases around any carcass. This suggests that this consumed slaughtered goat was not the first sick and dying animal in this village.
