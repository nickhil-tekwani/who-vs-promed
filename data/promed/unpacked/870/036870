[1] Safer indoors in winter

With the winter season upon us in the northern hemisphere, cold weather conditions are forcing people to stay indoors. Coupled with children heading back to school and offices reopening, there is looming concern around a 2nd wave of the coronavirus in Europe, North America, and other parts of the world.

COVID-19 is a highly contagious respiratory disease. In closed and crowded indoor settings, there is a higher risk of it spreading compared with the outdoors, where the flow of fresh air can dilute and dissipate the virus particles.

According to the WHO, the coronavirus is primarily transmitted by droplets spread through direct or close contact with an infected person, and indirect contact with contaminated surfaces, also known as fomite transmission.

But there is also the possibility of airborne transmission in crowded indoor settings with poor ventilation, such as restaurants, gyms, night clubs, and offices.

A number of measures can be taken to reduce the risk of infection in such closed settings.

Natural ventilation
-------------------
Ventilation is the introduction of fresh air into an indoor space while the stale air is pushed outside.

Whether at home or in public buildings, such as schools and offices, ventilation can be improved by simply opening windows and doors whenever possible.

Luca Fontana, a water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) specialist consultant at the WHO, told Al Jazeera ventilation is "one part of the big package of infection prevention and control measures" along with physical distancing, hand hygiene, and face masks.

"The general proposal of ventilation in the building is to provide healthy air for breathing by both diluting the pollutant originating in the building and removing the pollutant from the space itself," he said in a recent Facebook live Q&A.

HVAC systems
------------
In public spaces, ventilation through mechanical measures like heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems can be helpful in improving indoor air quality.

According to the WHO, a well-maintained and operated HVAC system can reduce the spread of COVID-19 in indoor spaces by increasing the rate of air change, reducing recirculation of air, and increasing the use of outdoor air.

The air should preferably not be recirculated and the HVAC systems should be regularly inspected, maintained, and cleaned by professionals.

The WHO has outlined technical specifications for operating and maintaining these systems in the context of COVID-19.

Filters and fans
----------------
High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters that are commonly used in aeroplanes and hospitals are another useful tool to remove viruses and germs from the atmosphere.

These can minimise the duration of the exposure to any potential infectious materials produced by a cough or sneeze.

The use of fans, with certain considerations, can improve air circulation and reduce pockets of stagnant air in an enclosed space.

"A table or pedestal fan is safe for air circulation among family members living together who are not infected with the virus that causes COVID-19," said Maria Neira, director of the department of public health and environment at the WHO.

"However, fans should be avoided when people who are not part of the immediate family [are present], since some people could have the virus despite not having symptoms," she added.

"Air blowing from an infected person directly at another in a closed space might increase the transmission of the virus from one person to another."

When using a ceiling fan, Fontana said it was important to maintain good ventilation -- by opening a window for instance -- as an efficient way to increase the exchange of air between indoors and outdoors.

UV lighting
-----------
Ultraviolet (UV) radiation can generally be used to disinfect air, water, and surfaces. But its effectiveness in inactivating the SARS-CoV-2 virus -- which causes COVID-19 -- is not fully established.

According to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), UV radiation has been shown to destroy the outer protein coating of the SARS-coronavirus, but there is limited published data about the wavelength, dose, and duration of UV radiation needed to render it inactive.

The WHO's Fontana said UV lamps should always be used with HEPA filters and not as a stand-alone solution.

Meanwhile, the UN health agency has strongly cautioned against using UV light to disinfect hands or other areas of your skin as this may cause skin irritation and damage your eyes.

Redesigning buildings
---------------------
The pandemic is also pushing architects, engineers, and urban planners to rethink the way buildings, especially public places, are designed.

On its website, the US Environment Protection Agency (EPA) recommends: "Reorienting adjoining workstations so employees do not face each other could be an important component of an overall plan to address the virus." In places like Mauritius, Italy, and Ghana, Intensive Care Units (ICUs) and COVID-19 screening facilities have been purposely built to allow for natural ventilation.

"In the ... future, defining clear design may strengthen the use of natural ventilation in different healthcare settings," Fontana said, adding that the WHO was working to identify key building criteria not just for COVID-19, but other potential respiratory diseases as well.

Testing air quality
-------------------
Simple devices are available on the market to measure the airflow rate and direction.

Measuring the level of carbon dioxide (CO2) is a good indicator of indoor air quality, Fontana explained.

"The more crowded the place is, the more CO2 is produced into the space; and the more effective the ventilation is, the lower the level of CO2," he said.

Companies are also racing to find more sophisticated and innovative ways to tackle the pandemic.

PathogenDx, a US-based enterprise, has developed a DNA/RNA-based microarray testing technology to specifically detect the new coronavirus in the air and on surfaces. The human sample diagnostics are yet to be approved by the FDA, but the company is already selling its kits for environmental testing. Milan Patel, co-founder and CEO of PathogenDx, told Al Jazeera this hybrid technology can be beneficial in aeroplanes, gyms, call centres, and other enclosed spaces. The Native American Cherokee Nation is among their biggest clients, carrying out 200 to 300 tests a month for its population.

"This isn't an at-home test; it is one that a lab does because at the end of the day it's a molecular type of testing and it needs all the lab
equipment ... and the level of sensitivity with this type of equipment," Patel said.

[Good ventilation could be the key to avoiding coronavirus infections as autumn approaches and people spend more time indoors. The use of split air conditioning units that recirculate cooled room air may contribute to the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/7/20-0764_article).

Furthermore, the use of a ventilation system to ensure clean air circulation in the home should be coupled with checks of the vent filters as these are not fool-proof. In the US, researchers investigating the Oregon Health & Science University Hospital found that traces of coronavirus were trapped by the filters with some leakage reported. Similarly, in South Korea, a call centre on the 11th floor of an office building had one person infect more than 90 others.

Lessons for indoors, in addition to other precautions such as hand washing and disinfection, adequate ventilation, and air circulation while keeping the indoors comfortable during the cooler weather will be a challenge. - Mod.UBA]

[2] Spain: restrictions
Date: Wed 30 Sep 2020 CEST

Residents of infection hotspot Madrid are to be barred from leaving except on essential trips under new rules to fight the coronavirus resurgence, Spain's government said on Wednesday [30 Sep 2020].

But regional authorities said the decision had no legal basis, setting the stage for a political showdown in an area accounting for more than 1/3 of Spain's 133 604 new cases in the past 2 weeks.

"Madrid's health is Spain's health. Madrid is special," Health Minister Salvador Illa told a news conference to announce the new regulations, due to come into force in days.

The capital city, with more than 3 million people, and 9 surrounding municipalities with at least 100 000 inhabitants each, are to see borders closed to outsiders for non-essential visits, the government said.

People would be allowed to cross boundaries for work, school, doctors' visits, or shopping, but not for leisure.

Other measures include the closure of bars and restaurants at 11 p.m., from a previous curfew of 1 a.m., as well as shutting parks and playgrounds. Social gatherings will be limited to 6 people.

Madrid has 735 cases per 100 000 people, one of the highest of any region in Europe and double Spain's national rate.

The conservative regional assembly had already enforced localised lockdowns in 45, mostly poor districts, often with a high immigrant population.

But the wider restrictions announced by Illa see the Socialist-led central government override the regional authority after weeks of fighting over what should be done.

Spain has recorded 769 188 cases -- the highest in Western Europe -- and 31 791 deaths.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

Data by country, area, or territory for 30 Sep 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesSept30_1601553676.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 33.3% of daily case numbers and 36.1% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, maintaining its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 16.5 million cases. The USA and Brazil remain dominant, followed by Argentina, Colombia, Peru, and Mexico. Other countries reporting more than 1000 new cases in the past 24 hours include Chile and Canada.

- The European region reported 20.0% of daily case numbers and 16.8% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 5.8 million. Countries not reporting cases today (30 Sep 2020) include Spain, Israel, and Kazakhstan. The dominant country is Russia followed by the France, UK, Ukraine, Netherlands, and Czech Republic. Other countries reporting more than 1000 new cases in the past 24 hours include Germany, Italy, Romania, Turkey, Poland, and Germany.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 7.4% of daily case numbers and 9.8% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of greater than 2.3 million cases. Iraq remains the dominant country, followed by Iran, Morocco, Lebanon, Libya, Jordan, Pakistan, UAE, Oman, and Palestinian Authority.

- The African region reported 1.6% of daily case numbers and 2.8% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.1 million cases. South Africa is again the dominant country, followed by Ethiopia, Mozambique, Ghana, Uganda, Kenya, Nigeria, and Algeria. However, all reporting countries reported less than 1000 cases.

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.3% of daily case numbers and 2.1% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.61 million cases. The Philippines continues to dominate, followed by Japan, South Korea, and Malaysia.

- The South East Asia region reported 36.5% of the daily newly reported cases and 32.3% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 6.9 million cases. India continues to dominate followed by Indonesia, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Myanmar.

Today's report from Europe has weekend reporting artifact with key countries not reporting new cases in the past 24 hours. That being said, Europe is experiencing resurgences in many countries related to loosening restrictions and the summer vacation period. The Americas continue to have more countries reporting cases although there is a muting consisting with weekend artifact. Major transmission is also ongoing in South East Asia, specifically India, but other countries are following suit. - Cases are increasing in Nepal and Myanmar.

[The USA, India, and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations, with India in the 2nd position followed by Brazil. In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (86 748), followed by the USA (40 929) and Brazil (33 269) -- account for over half (54.4%) of all confirmed cases globally and 50.9% of all newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. As the daily reports from each of the 3 countries have been dropping, other countries are reporting more newly confirmed cases. A global total of 6208 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (30 Sep - 1 Oct 2020).

Countries reporting more than 5000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours include India, USA, Brazil, Argentina (14 392), France (12 845), Spain (11 016), Israel (8568), Russia (8481), UK (7108), and Colombia (5637); 36 countries have reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours. 8 of the top 20 countries reporting the highest daily newly confirmed cases are from the European region and 6 were from the Americas region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase in case counts by 0.90%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 3.0%.

Impression: While the global 7-day averages appear to have plateaued, when one looks at the country-by-country figures, the 3 major countries -- the USA, India, and Brazil -- have decreased their daily newly confirmed cases, but other countries have increased transmission, especially in Europe and the Americas. - Mod.UBA]
