[1] Sarilumab enters clinical trial for COVID-19

The rheumatoid arthritis drug Sarilumab is set to enter a clinical trial program for patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 infection, according to a joint statement released by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi. Sarilumab (Kevzara) -- jointly developed Regeneron and Sanofi -- is a fully human, monoclonal antibody that inhibits the interleukin-6 (IL-6) pathway by binding and blocking the IL-6 receptor. According to the pharmaceutical companies' joint statement, IL-6 may play a role in driving the overactive inflammatory response in the lungs of patients who are severely or critically ill with COVID-19.

In an email, Cassandra Calabrese, DO, of the Cleveland Clinic, and Leonard Calabrese, DO, RJ Fasenmyer chair of clinical immunology at the Cleveland Clinic, and chief medical editor of Healio Rheumatology, wrote there is a growing body of reports showing the benefit of targeting the IL-6 pathway in patients with COVID-19, most notably in recent single-arm study in China.

"It appears that IL-6 may play a key role in driving the inflammatory response that leads to morbidity and mortality and patients with COVID-19 who develop acute respiratory distress syndrome," they told Healio Rheumatology. "While we await evidence-based data, there have been reports of increasing experience using tocilizumab, another IL-6 inhibitor, to treat these patients with severe COVID-19 infection, including a non-peer-reviewed retrospective Chinese experience describing 21 COVID-19 positive patients with severe illness who received tocilizumab. They observed improvement in oxygenation and other clinical outcomes."

In that Chinese study, conducted by Xiaolong Xu, MD, of the First Affiliated Hospital of the University of Science and Technology of China, and colleagues, tocilizumab (Actemra, Genentech) was given to 21 patients with severe COVID-19, in addition to routine therapy, between [5 Feb and 14 Feb 2020]. According to the researchers, fevers returned to normal and all other symptoms "improved remarkably" within a few days. Additionally, 75% of patients had lowered their oxygen intake and one patient no longer needed oxygen therapy. There were no obvious adverse reactions. A total of 19 patients were discharged after an average of 13.5 days following treatment, with the remainder "recovering well" as of the time of the study's release, the researchers wrote.

According to Cassandra Calabrese and Leonard Calabrese, the role of IL-6 in the integrated host defense is complex. A review article published in June 2017 in Nature Reviews Rheumatology, and co-authored by Calabrese, found that IL-6 has a role in both the innate and adaptive immune responses that protect the host from a variety of infections. Clinical studies of IL-6 inhibitors, specifically tocilizumab, reveal that their use is associated with an increased rate of both serious and opportunistic infections generally in the range observed with other non-IL-6 directed biologic therapies, the researchers wrote.

"Although the role of IL-6 clearly important in the integrated host defense against a variety of pathogens, extrapolation from genetic knockout models is problematic and not consistent with partial neutralization during periods of overproduction," Cassandra Calabrese and Leonard Calabrese said. "The pathogenesis of progressive COVID-19 disease is still being investigated, but it appears that advanced disease states with hypoxemic pneumonia is associated with a marked pro-inflammatory state or 'cytokine storm' phenotype."

According to Regeneron and Sanofi, the US-based Sarilumab trial will begin in New York and will assess the safety and efficacy of adding the drug to usual supportive care, compared with supportive care plus placebo.

The multicenter, double-blind, phase 2/3 trial will come in 2 parts. In part one, patients with severe COVID-19 recruited from 16 centers will be evaluated for fever and need for supplemental oxygen. The 2nd, larger part of the trial will evaluate improvement in longer-term outcomes, including preventing death and reducing the need for mechanical ventilation, supplemental oxygen and hospitalization. The researchers anticipate enrolling up to 400 participants.

In addition to the Sarilumab program, Regeneron is also advancing a novel antibody cocktail for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, which the company hopes to have available for human testing this summer, according to the release.

"Data from China suggest that the IL-6 pathway may play an important role in the overactive inflammatory response in the lungs of patients with COVID-19," he added. "Despite this encouraging finding, it's imperative to conduct a properly designed, randomized trial to understand the true impact. Our trial is the 1st controlled trial in the United States to evaluate the effect of IL-6 inhibition prospectively in COVID-19 patients."

[2] Over 85% of COVID-19 Infections in China went undetected early on
Date: Mon 16 Mar 2020

Prior to widespread travel restrictions in China, more than 85% of COVID-19 coronavirus infections went unnoticed, a modeling study suggested. Only 14% of COVID-19 infections were documented in the 2 weeks prior to implementation of these widespread travel restrictions, meaning that the majority were people with mild symptoms or who were asymptomatic and who never sought care, reported Jeffrey Shaman, PhD, of Columbia University in New York City, and colleagues. Moreover, the transmission rate of undocumented infections was estimated to be 55% of documented infections during this time, the authors wrote Monday [23 Mar 2020] in Science.

These data were from mid-January [2020] before the Chinese government instituted strict containment and mitigation measures, like those now in place only in "pockets" of the U.S., the researchers pointed out on a conference call with reporters.

Researchers built a mathematical model that combined data on people's movements with infection rates, and modeled infections among 375 Chinese cities from [10 Jan to 23 Jan 2020], prior to travel restrictions in Hubei province going into effect. Moreover, in a model without transmission by undocumented cases, reported infections would be reduced by 79% in China and 66% in Wuhan during this time period.

"These people [undetected infected persons] were a major driver of it, they were the ones that facilitated the spread," Shaman said.

Co-author Sen Pei, PhD, also of Columbia University, added there were initially low documentation rates in China partially due to lack of testing assays. However, from [24 Jan to 8 Feb 2020], after the implementation of these restrictions and increased awareness, aggressive testing, and contact tracing, as well as increased personal protective behavior, 65% of infections were documented.

A 2nd study recently published on [6 Mar 2020] in Science also noted the effect of travel restrictions on the spread of COVID-19 in China, and co-author Alessandro Vespignani, PhD, of Northeastern University in Boston, noted they had "quite a modest effect" on the spread of the virus in China, though they did have a "more marked effect" on an international scale. Vespignani estimated they resulted in a "delay of a few weeks" in spreading of disease to other countries. When asked how this might apply to the U.S., he noted the epidemic is "already seeded" here, because we're seeing ongoing transmission in many states.

"Closing travel might delay progression of the epidemic in some places and provide some time for preparation," but he added "we need to have strong transmissibility reduction in [communities] where it's already seeded."

Reducing transmissibility includes early detection, isolation of cases, and community measures, such as social distancing and behavior changes, said co-author Elizabeth Halloran, MD, DSc, of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. And since undocumented cases, by definition, aren't included in official tallies, the number of cases in any given area could be exponentially higher than published counts.

Another co-author on the [6 Mar 2020] paper, Ira Longini, PhD, of the University of Florida, gave the example of 150 000 confirmed cases worldwide, but "generally, we're looking at an order of magnitude" higher for the number of actual infections -- thus meaning a worldwide total of around one million.

[3] Treatment for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome from COVID-19
Date: Fri 20 Mar 2020

https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(20)30127-2/fulltext


In The Lancet Respiratory Medicine, Kollengode Ramanathan and colleagues provide excellent recommendations for the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for patients with respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 2ary to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The authors describe pragmatic approaches to the challenges of delivering ECMO to patients with COVID-19, including training health-care personnel, resolving equipment and facilities issues, implementing systems for infection control and personal protection, providing overall support for health-care staff, and mitigating ethical issues. They also address some of the anticipated challenges with local and regional surges in COVID-19 ARDS cases; although there has been an increase in hospitals with the capacity to provide ECMO, the potential demand might exceed the available resources. Furthermore, some health-care systems offer advanced therapies such as ECMO but lack a coordinated local, regional, or national referral protocol.

Given the practical constraints on substantially increasing the global availability of ECMO services in the next few months, it is important to emphasise the other evidence-based treatment options that can be provided for patients with severe ARDS from COVID-19. Before endotracheal intubation, it is important to consider a trial of high-flow nasal oxygen for patients with moderately severe hypoxemia. This procedure might avoid the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation because it provides high concentrations of humidified oxygen, low levels of positive end-expiratory pressure, and can facilitate the elimination of carbon dioxide. WHO guidelines support the use of high-flow nasal oxygen in some patients, but they urge close monitoring for clinical deterioration that could result in the need for emergent intubations because such procedures might increase the risk of infection to health-care workers.

Since treatment of severe ARDS from COVID-19 is an ongoing challenge, it is important to learn from the patients who have been treated to gain an understanding of the disease's epidemiology, biological mechanisms, and the effects of new pharmacological interventions. Currently, there are some research groups working to coordinate and disseminate key information, including information on patients who have been treated with ECMO for COVID-19, although an accurate estimate of the number of such patients is not currently available. The Extracorporeal Life Support Organization is an international non-profit consortium that plans to maintain a registry of patients to facilitate an improved understanding of how ECMO is being used for patients with COVID-19.

[4] Rational use of face masks in the COVID-19 pandemic
Date: Fri 20 Mar 2020

Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that caused coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the use of face masks has become ubiquitous in China and other Asian countries such as South Korea and Japan. Some provinces and municipalities in China have enforced compulsory face mask policies in public areas; however, China's national guideline has adopted a risk-based approach in offering recommendations for using face masks among health-care workers and the general public. We compared face mask use recommendations by different health authorities (panel). Despite the consistency in the recommendation that symptomatic individuals and those in health-care settings should use face masks, discrepancies were observed in the general public and community settings.

Recommendations on face mask use in community settings
------------------------------------------------------
WHO
---
If you are healthy, you only need to wear a mask if you are taking care of a person with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection.

China
-----
- People at moderate risk *of infection: surgical or disposable mask for medical use.
People at moderate risk of infection include those working in areas of high population density (eg, hospitals, train stations), those have been or live with somebody who is quarantined, and administrative staff, police, security, and couriers whose work is related to COVID-19.
- People at low risk of infection: disposable mask for medical use.
People at low risk of infection include those staying in areas of high population density (eg, supermarket, shopping mall), who work indoors, who seek health care in medical institutions (other than fever clinics), and gatherings of children aged 3-6 years and school students.
- People at very low risk of infection: do not have to wear a mask or can wear non-medical mask (such as cloth mask).
People at very low risk of infection include those who mostly stay at home, who do outdoor activities, and who work or study in well-ventilated areas.

Hong Kong
---------
Surgical masks can prevent transmission of respiratory viruses from people who are ill. It is essential for people who are symptomatic (even if they have mild symptoms) to wear a surgical mask.
Wear a surgical mask when taking public transport or staying in crowded places. It is important to wear a mask properly and practice good hand hygiene before wearing and after removing a mask.
Singapore
---------
Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms, such as a cough or runny nose.

Japan
-----
The effectiveness of wearing a face mask to protect yourself from contracting viruses is thought to be limited. If you wear a face mask in confined, badly ventilated spaces, it might help avoid catching droplets emitted from others but if you are in an open-air environment, the use of face mask is not very efficient.

USA
---
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend that people who are well wear a face mask (including respirators) to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19.
US Surgeon General urged people on Twitter to stop buying face masks.

UK
--
Face masks play a very important role in places such as hospitals, but there is very little evidence of widespread benefit for members of the public.

Germany
-------
There is not enough evidence to prove that wearing a surgical mask significantly reduces a healthy person's risk of becoming infected while wearing it. According to WHO, wearing a mask in situations where it is not recommended to do so can create a false sense of security because it might lead to neglecting fundamental hygiene measures, such as proper hand hygiene.

However, there is an essential distinction between absence of evidence and evidence of absence. Evidence that face masks can provide effective protection against respiratory infections in the community is scarce, as acknowledged in recommendations from the UK and Germany. However, face masks are widely used by medical workers as part of droplet precautions when caring for patients with respiratory infections. It would be reasonable to suggest vulnerable individuals avoid crowded areas and use surgical face masks rationally when exposed to high-risk areas. As evidence suggests COVID-19 could be transmitted before symptom onset, community transmission might be reduced if everyone, including people who have been infected but are asymptomatic and contagious, wear face masks.

Recommendations on face masks vary across countries and we have seen that the use of masks increases substantially once local epidemics begin, including the use of N95 respirators (without any other protective equipment) in community settings. This increase in use of face masks by the general public exacerbates the global supply shortage of face masks, with prices soaring, and risks supply constraints to frontline health-care professionals. As a response, a few countries (eg, Germany and South Korea) banned exportation of face masks to prioritise local demand. WHO called for a 40% increase in the production of protective equipment, including face masks. Meanwhile, health authorities should optimise face mask distribution to prioritise the needs of frontline health-care workers and the most vulnerable populations in communities who are more susceptible to infection and mortality if infected, including older adults (particularly those older than 65 years) and people with underlying health conditions.

People in some regions (eg, Thailand, China, and Japan) opted for makeshift alternatives or repeated usage of disposable surgical masks. Notably, improper use of face masks, such as not changing disposable masks, could jeopardise the protective effect and even increase the risk of infection.

Consideration should also be given to variations in societal and cultural paradigms of mask usage. The contrast between face mask use as hygienic practice (i.e, in many Asian countries) or as something only people who are unwell do (i.e, in European and North American countries) has induced stigmatisation and racial aggravations, for which further public education is needed. One advantage of universal use of face masks is that it prevents discrimination of individuals who wear masks when unwell because everybody is wearing a mask.

It is time for governments and public health agencies to make rational recommendations on appropriate face mask use to complement their recommendations on other preventive measures, such as hand hygiene. WHO currently recommends that people should wear face masks if they have respiratory symptoms or if they are caring for somebody with symptoms. Perhaps it would also be rational to recommend that people in quarantine wear face masks if they need to leave home for any reason, to prevent potential asymptomatic or presymptomatic transmission. In addition, vulnerable populations, such as older adults and those with underlying medical conditions, should wear face masks if available. Universal use of face masks could be considered if supplies permit. In parallel, urgent research on the duration of protection of face masks, the measures to prolong life of disposable masks, and the invention on reusable masks should be encouraged. Taiwan had the foresight to create a large stockpile of face masks; other countries or regions might now consider this as part of future pandemic plans.

[5] Preliminary evidence that higher temperatures are associated with lower incidence of COVID-19
Date: Sat 21 Mar 2020
Source: Medrvix [preprint, edited]
https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.18.20036731v1.full.pdf


Abstract
--------
Seasonal variation in COVID-19 incidence could impact the trajectory of the pandemic. Using global line-list data on COVID-19 cases reported until [29 Feb 2020] and global gridded temperature data, and after adjusting for surveillance capacity and time since 1st imported case, higher average temperature was strongly associated with lower COVID-19 incidence for temperatures of 1°C and higher. However, temperature explained a relatively modest amount of the total variation in COVID-19 incidence. These preliminary findings support stringent containment efforts in Europe and elsewhere.

Case Report
-----------
An outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China caused by SARS-CoV-2 has led to a serious epidemic in China and other countries, resulting in worldwide concern. With the active efforts from prevention and control, the quantity of discharged patients is escalating. How to manage these patients normatively is still challenging. We hereby reported an asymptomatic discharged patient with COVID-19 who was retested positive for SARS-CoV-2, which arouses concern regarding the present discharge standard of COVID-19.

[The epidemiologic significance of a persistently positive RNA PCR test is uncertain, since detection of viral RNA alone does not mean that there are intact virions in adequate numbers to have infective potential. There are many unknowns regarding what criteria should be used to discharge a confirmed case. Globally countries and health agencies have revised or updated their guidance in this regard;

According to the CDC guidance published on 23 Mar 2020
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/disposition-hospitalized-patients.html;

- Clarified that patients with COVID-19 can be discharged from a healthcare facility whenever clinically indicated. Meeting criteria for discontinuation of Transmission-Based Precautions is not a prerequisite for discharge.
- Updated guidance for a test-based strategy: The recommendation to collect both NP and OP swabs at each sampling has been changed so that only one swab, preferably an NP, is necessary at each sampling.
- Added guidance for:
Discontinuation of transmission-based precautions without testing.
Discontinuation of empiric transmission-based precautions for patients suspected of having COVID-19.
When using a testing-based strategy for discontinuation of transmission-based precautions is preferred.

The Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) coronavirus (COVID-19) statement on 21 Mar 2020 states;
https://www.health.gov.au/news/australian-health-protection-principal-committee-ahppc-coronavirus-covid-19-statement-on-21-march-2020;

1. Confirmed cases with mild illness who did not require hospitalisation:
The person can be released from isolation if they meet all of the following criteria:
- at least 10 days have passed since the onset of symptoms; and
- there has been resolution of all symptoms of the acute illness for the previous 72 hours.
The person should be advised to continue to be diligent with hand hygiene and cough etiquette and practice social distancing, as is indicated for the rest of the community, as this will assist in reducing the influenza transmission.

2. Confirmed cases with more severe illness who have been discharged from hospital:
If the person is ready clinically for hospital discharge, but has not had 2 consecutive swabs taken at least 24 hours apart which are negative for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR, then they should discharged to home isolation.
The person can be released from isolation if they meet all of the following criteria:
- at least 10 days have passed since hospital discharge; and
- there has been resolution of all symptoms of the acute illness for the previous 72 hours.
The person should be advised to continue to be diligent with hand hygiene and cough etiquette and practice social distancing, as is indicated for the rest of the community, as this will assist be reducing the influenza transmission.

3. All cases who have specimens taken at clinical recovery can be released from isolation if they meet the criteria below
A confirmed case can be released from isolation if they meet all of the following criteria:
- the person has been afebrile for the previous 48 hours;
- resolution of the acute illness for the previous 24 hours;
- be at least 7 days after the onset of the acute illness;
- PCR negative on at least 2 consecutive respiratory specimens collected 24 hours apart after the acute illness has resolved.
