REAGENTS, DETECTION OF EMERGING DISEASES: REQUEST FOR INFO
**********************************************************
A ProMED-mail post

From: Dr. Thomas Egwang <egwang@imul.com>

We have been following with great scientific interest and understandable
concern about emerging, re-emerging diseases through out the world, e.g.
the current H5N1 influenza outbreak in Hong Kong. Our overriding concern is
how we would be able to handle the question of diagnosis of suspected
infections in the unlikely event (one hopes) that one day it strikes.
We are interested in stocking immunochemical reagents such as specific
antibodies or antigens for ELISA detection of pathogen antigens or history
of exposure by detection of specific antibodies, respectively, in serum
samples. We would like to do this for a wide variety of pathogens which
have caused outbreaks in other countries. The goal is to have some kind of
preparedness in being able to detect new infections or confirm suspected
diagnosis.
In addition to ELISA, our laboratory has facilities for PCR, post-PCR
analysis, and DNA sequencing. We do not have biological containment
facilities nor do we plan to in the near future apart from laminar flow
hoods for cellular immunology studies.
I would appreciate advice from scientists and public health specialists out
there how one would go about acquiring the required reagents for both
immunological and molecular detection of new pathogens, given our rather
limited facilities. For example, where would we be able to obtain H5N1
antigens or specific monoclonal antibodies?
