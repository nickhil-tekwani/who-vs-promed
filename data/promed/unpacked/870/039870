Infectious salmon anemia in the United States of America
-------------------
Emergency report
Information received on 16 Jun 2003 from Dr Peter Fernandez, Associate
Administrator, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA), Washington, DC:
Report date: 16 Jun 2003.
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory.
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 11 Jun 2003.
Estimated date of first infection: 9 Jun 2003.
Outbreaks:
Location: Broad Cove, Cobscook Bay, State of Maine
No. of outbreaks: 1 farm
Description of affected population: Atlantic salmon (Salmosalar).
Total number of animals in the outbreak:
species/ susceptible/ cases/ deaths/ destroyed/ slaughtered
pis/ 28,000/ 1
cage/ .../ 0/ 28,000
Diagnosis:
This is the first incidence of infectious salmon anemia (ISA) virus in
Maine since the ISA outbreak in the spring of 2001 (see Disease
Information, 14 [12], 65, et seq.). The surveillance programme that was
implemented as a result of the 2001 outbreak allowed early detection of the
virus.
Following the outbreak of 2001, all infected and exposed sites were
depopulated, cleaned and disinfected. Sites were fallowed for up to 90
days. Some sites were restocked in the spring of 2002. Biosecurity measures
were implemented, an integrated pest management programme implemented (for
sea lice), control of transportation movement implemented, and single
year-class farming implemented. All farms participate in the USDA ISA
programme. As part of the surveillance programme, low-risk sites are
sampled monthly, and high-risk sites are sampled twice a month. It was
through this
surveillance programme that the samples which led to this detection were
taken on 9 Jun 2003.
A. Laboratory where diagnosis was made: MicroTechnologiesInc., Richmond, Maine.
B. Diagnostic tests used: indirect fluorescent antibody test (positive at
+3) and RT-PCR(1) (positive). Tissue samples are being cultured for
definitive confirmation.
Epidemiology:
A. Source of agent / origin of infection: unknown.
B. Mode of spread: ISA virus is considered a slow spreading low virulent
virus. The mode of spread of ISA virus may be
passively in seawater, via sea lice as a vector, or there may be a natural
host acting as a reservoir, although none of these has been confirmed in
the field.
Control measures: on 16 Jun 2003 the farm was depopulated.
(1) RT-PCR: reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction
