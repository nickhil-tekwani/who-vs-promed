Seasonal Influenza: Influenza Virus Vaccine 2008/2009 season
------------------------------------------------------------
The Food and Drug Administration's Vaccines and Related Biological
Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) met in Gaithersburg, Maryland,
on 21 Feb 2008, to select the influenza virus strains for the
composition of the influenza vaccine for use in the 2008-2009 U.S.
influenza season. During this meeting, the advisory panel reviewed
and evaluated the surveillance data related to epidemiology and
antigenic characteristics, serological responses to 2007/2008
vaccines, and the availability of candidate strains and reagents.

The panel recommended that vaccines to be used in the 2008-2009
influenza season in the U.S. contain the following:

- an A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1)-like virus;
- an A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2)-like virus; *
- a B/Florida/4/2006-like virus. #

* A/Brisbane/10/2007 is a current southern hemisphere vaccine virus.

#B/Florida/4/2006 and B/Brisbane/3/2007 (a B/Florida/4/2006-like
virus) are current southern hemisphere vaccine viruses. The influenza
vaccine composition to be used in the 2008-2009 influenza season in
the U.S. is identical to that recommended by the World Health
Organization on 14 Feb 2008, for the Northern Hemisphere's 2008-2009.
