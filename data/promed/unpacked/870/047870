Malaria cases up among soldiers in Afghanistan
----------------------------------------------
Cases of the mosquito-borne disease malaria, which military doctors say are preventable, have struck US troops in Afghanistan at the highest rate there in 9 years.

According to a report published by the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center [AFHSC] last month [January 2012], 124 cases appeared among American troops in 2011. Of those, 91 -- nearly 3 out of 4 -- were diagnosed in Afghanistan.

The number of cases in Afghanistan is proportionately higher than the number of cases acquired in the tropical regions of Africa and Haiti, where US troops provided assistance following the 2010 earthquake.

In 2011, malaria diagnoses among US troops were highest in the Army, the largest ground force. "Unfortunately, after 10 years of US military presence in Afghanistan, and despite the availability of effective prevention measures and a long organizational history of fighting the disease, malaria remains a threat to US forces and their operations in Afghanistan," Col Mark Fukuda, a doctor with the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center's malaria surveillance program, wrote in a commentary that accompanied the report.

Cases by service
----------------
The Army had the largest number of malaria cases in 2011. Numbers of cases reported by each service:
Army: 99
Marine Corps: 12
Navy: 7
Air Force: 6
Total: 124

Of the 124 cases in the US military, 24 were linked to Africa, 4 to South Korea, and 5 were of unknown origin. No US service members have died from malaria, according to AFHSC.

Possible reasons for the jump in reported cases include the 30,000 troops who arrived in Afghanistan in 2011 and an improved capacity for reporting and diagnosing malaria, the AFHSC report said.

Lt Col Laura Pacha, of the US Army Public Health Command's disease epidemiology program, said that in spite of malaria's association with the tropics, infections do occur in temperate climates such as those of Afghanistan and Korea. "We used to have it in the United States as well, until we eradicated it," she said.

Fukuda wrote that malaria and other infectious diseases can be prevented with the combination of the right anti-malarial drugs, the use of DEET-based repellent, proper wear of permethrin-treated uniforms and the use of bed nets. Such measures are not only required but could "make a crucial difference -- in enhancing military operational effectiveness and saving lives," he wrote.

Between 2004 and 2006, while deployed to Liberia as part of an international peacekeeping force, Swedish troops suffered no malaria cases, Fukuda wrote. Soldiers were instructed to use DEET-based repellent and mosquito nets; and soldiers took anti-malaria tablets together at the same time every day. By contrast, Fukuda wrote, US troops in Liberia took their anti-malarials on the "honor system," had no bed nets, and their use of insect repellent was low. 36 percent of the US troops were diagnosed with malaria infections.

In November [2011], the Army dropped the anti-malarial drug mefloquine. Users had complained the pill caused psychiatric symptoms ranging from nightmares, depression, and paranoia to auditory hallucinations and mental breakdowns.

Pacha said soldiers are exposed to predeployment training and posters that caution soldiers to take preventative measures. She suggested soldiers wear their permethrin-treated uniforms with sleeves down and pant legs tucked in; coat exposed skin with DEET-based repellents; use their medication as prescribed and avoid going out at dawn and dusk, when mosquitoes are biting the most. "No single method is 100 percent," Pacha said. "You really do have to implement the full spectrum of prevention measures."

[The situation in Afghanistan makes surveillance, reporting, and control of malaria difficult.

An increase in malaria transmission in areas where control is not possible would be expected. A recent report of substandard malaria drugs in Pakistan could indicate that drugs available for the general population in Afghanistan were also substandard (see Leslie T, et al: Epidemic of Plasmodium falciparum Malaria Involving Substandard Antimalarial Drugs, Pakistan, 2003. Emerg Infect Dis. 2009;15(11): 1753-9; available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2857251).

A study published in 2007 found that "In 2002, the total malaria burden in Afghanistan was estimated to be 3 million cases annually, mainly from Takhar and Kunduz Provinces. Field investigations from 2001 to 2007 revealed a rapid resurgence of _Plasmodium falciparum_ and _P. vivax_ malaria, with annual incidence rates between 0.0026 and 4.39, and between 0.88 and 13.37 episodes/1000 person years, respectively. Both diseases peaked during 2002, and then declined independently, indicating two differing modes of transmission and epidemiology (Faulde MK et al: Epidemiology of _Plasmodium falciparum_ and _P. vivax_ malaria endemic in northern Afghanistan. J Egypt Soc Parasitol. 2008; 38(3): 679-92; abstract available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19209754).

_P. falciparum_ malaria has been reported in the Bamian valley (altitude 2250 m-2400 m/7400 ft-7800 ft) where the study found 63 cases of malaria (90.5 percent _P. falciparum_) out of 215 blood smears obtained, the remainder _P. vivax_ (see Abdur Rab M et al: High altitude epidemic malaria in Bamian province, central Afghanistan. East Mediterr Health J. 2003; 9(3): 232-9); available at http://www.emro.who.int/Publications/EMHJ/0903/PDF/01%20High%20altitude%20epidemic%20malaria.pdf. Areas above 2000 meters (6500 ft) altitude are usually thought to be too cold for sustained malaria transmission.

The data indicate that malaria is not under control in Afghanistan, is most probably underreported, and that protection against vectorborne diseases in United States servicemen can be improved.
