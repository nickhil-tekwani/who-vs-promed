BRUCELLA ABORTUS, HUMAN EXPOSURE - USA (KANSAS)

Human Exposure to _Brucella abortus_ Strain RB51 - Kansas, 1997
On May 26-27, 1997, nine persons (a farmer, four veterinary clinicians, and
four veterinary students) in Manhattan, Kansas, participated in an attempted
vaginal delivery, a cesarean delivery, and a necropsy on a stillborn calf
that died because of _Brucella abortus_ infection. The infection was confirmed
by isolation of _B. abortus_ from placental and fetal lung tissue cultures.
The National Animal Disease Center, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA),
identified the _B. abortus_ isolate from the calf as the RB51 vaccine strain.
RB51 is a live, attenuated strain that was licensed conditionally by the
Veterinary Services, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA, on
February 23, 1996, for vaccination of cattle in the United States. Before
1996, vaccine was made by using the S19 strain. This report describes
occupational exposure to animals infected with the RB51 strain and
emphasizes the need for surveillance of unintentional exposure of humans to
RB51 to assess outcomes of such exposures.
MMWR Editorial Note: Brucellosis, also known as "undulant fever" or "Bangs
disease," is a systemic infection caused by _Brucella_ sp., small
Gram-negative cocco-bacilli that can infect cattle (infection with _B.
abortus_), goats and sheep ( _B. melitensis_), pigs ( _B. suis_), and dogs
(_B.
canis_). Worldwide, brucellosis usually occurs in geographic areas with large
populations of these animal hosts. Disease manifestations in animals depend
on age and gestational status. The primary sign of infection in female
animals is abortion, and in male animals, epididymitis.
Brucellosis in humans is a systemic disease that has an acute or insidious
onset; signs and symptoms of the disease include continued, intermittent, or
irregular fever of variable duration; headache; weakness; profuse sweaty
chills; arthralgia; depression; weight loss; and generalized aches. The
disease can persist for periods ranging from days to years if not treated
properly. _B. abortus_ RB51 infection in humans is possible but has not been
documented.
Through a cooperative state and federal effort, the United States is now
approaching eradication of the field strain of _B. abortus_ in domestic cattle
and bison herds. In the United States, the Brucellosis Eradication Program
(BEP) was established formally in 1954 to prevent the considerable economic
losses caused by abortions that occurred before, or in the absence of,
prophylactic vaccination and to reduce transmission of the disease to
humans. Vaccination against brucellosis and testing or depopulation of
affected herds have reduced the number of infected cattle herds in the
United StatesÂ….
Veterinarians and other animal health-care personnel should be made aware of
the possible risk for infection associated with the veterinary use of RB51.
The epidemiologic conditions leading to possible infection in farmers and
veterinarians are not unusual. Using the estimated rate of unintentional
needle stick injuries among health-care workers in U.S. hospitals as a
surrogate for unintentional inoculations with RB51, at least 11,000
needle stick injuries per 5.5 million injections (i.e., the number of
Brucella vaccine doses administered in 1996) can be expected during 1 year.
Exposure of farm and veterinary personnel to infected calves or placentas is
another potential source of human infection, especially on farms where
heifers might be vaccinated mistakenly during mid-gestation (i.e., at which
time the calf fetus may be at greatest risk for post vaccination brucellosis).
CDC has established a registry of human exposures to the RB51 vaccine
strain; after unintentional, conjunctival, or other suspected exposure to
RB51, veterinarians, clinicians, or health department personnel should
contact CDC's Meningitis and Special Pathogens Branch, Division of Bacterial
and Mycotic Diseases, National Center for Infectious Diseases, to report the
incident and discuss additional recommendations; telephone (404) 639-3158;
fax (404) 639-0817.

[I contacted Fred Enright, D/Dept. Veterinary Science, LSU, a good friend
and a long time researcher on brucellosis for comments on the MMWR report.
Firstly, the infected Kansas calf died of dystochia. Secondly, this report
is part of an effort to determine what risk RB51 has for those handling and
vaccinating cattle. All reports are ultimately referred to Ed Young, Chief,
Infectious Diseases, Baylor Medical Center. The problem is that most
livestock veterinarians and many livestock owners have for decades been
exposed to S19, which can produce very nasty side effects when one
vaccinates oneself; self vaccination when working cattle is not at all
unusual. Because of this past exposure, any risks posed by this relatively
new vaccine are obscured. So anyone exposed is strongly advised to contact
the above clearing house, and especially those veterinarians that are newly
qualified or are still students.
So far RB51 appears to be safe and not a human pathogen, producing neither
infection nor disease. Only a fraction of people accidentally exposed
produce humoral antibodies. Apparently those injecting themselves are
advised to undergo 1 - 2 weeks of treatment with doxycycline; any exposure
less, one should merely watch & wait. It is an excellent vaccine, is
presently the vaccine to be used with US cattle, and holds promise as a
human vaccine. Similar derivatives involving _B. melitensis_ are undergoing
trials and look even better. The ability of RB51 to protect wildlife (elk,
bison) and to reduce shedding in reactors are still under trial. - Mod.MHJ]
