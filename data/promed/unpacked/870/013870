Comment on Reporting of Professor Ironside's Paper
--------------------------------------------------
James Ironside's widely reported paper at the British Association contains
nothing new [see CJD (new var.) - UK: update Sep 2001 20010906.2134. It
was a condensation of information reported in the 9th Annual Report of the
CJD Surveillance Unit [see CJD (new var.) - UK: 9th Annual Report
20010706.1293, the full contents of which are available on the CJDSU
Website at . However, the quoted phrase
"Another, which Professor Ironside thought was more likely, was that
northerners have had more exposure to the disease, because they were more
likely to have eaten more pies and burgers containing low-grade meat."
Either the condensation or the reporting gives a completely misleading
impression of the actual findings.
The Report actual states the following. "To investigate whether the
difference between North and South might be related to socio-economic
differences, we examined the Carstairs' index for each case based on their
place of residence (enumeration district [ED) in 1991. The mean Carstairs'
score for the cases was -0.41 (95% c.i. -1.02, 0.19), close to the national
average (0.0), and to the average conditional on their regional
distribution (0.11). The cases were evenly distributed across the 5
quintiles of the index.
Data from the Dietary and Nutritional Survey of British Adults on
consumption of those items most relevant to putative transmission of BSE
through diet are presented in Table 6 [not reproduced here, please refer to
original report - Mod.CP. Those items most likely to have contained
mechanically recovered meat (MRM) or high titre material from the central
nervous system ("burgers and kebabs," "sausages," "meat pies and pastries,"
"other meat products") show no consistent pattern of higher consumption in
the northern regions. While consumption of "meat pies and pastries" appears
to be highest in the north, consumption of "burgers and kebabs" and "other
meat products" appears highest in the South East.
Moreover, the statement: "However, SEAC [the Spongiform Encephalopathy
Advisory Committee says it has been "continually thwarted" in its efforts
to extract information from the industry. Last month the Food Standards
Agency (FSA) launched a new investigation to try to extract information
from the industry", which has been widely repeated in the media since FSA
launched its investigation a few weeks ago, shows how unaware official
bodies are of information already at their disposal.
In fact, an extensive audit for MAFF at the instigation of SEAC was already
carried [out between June 1996 and February 1997 by Leatherhead Food
Research Association in conjunction with the Meat and Livestock Commission,
with a questionnaire to several trade associations, including the British
Meat Manufacturers' Association (which collected data from member companies
and provided it to LFRA and MLC under coded references) and "selected key
companies" that were not referred to by name. This resulted in a 40-page
report for MAFF dated May 1997, entitled "Audit of Bovine and Ovine
Slaughter and By-products Sector" and written by Bob Hart and Nick Church
for Leatherhead FRA and A J Kempster and K R Matthews for the MLC. The
audit was broken down into 3 periods, 1980-85, 1986-90, and 1991-95. The
Report gave the most comprehensive analysis of the resulting data,
including that concerning MRM. It included calculation of the probable
incidence of spinal cord in beef MRM and arrived at an average
contamination level of 0.4 percent in 1980-89, falling to 0.005 percent in
1990-95 as the SBO ban took effect. The report was in the hands of MAFF in
1997. If [representatives of FSA claim, as reportedly they do, not to have
any knowledge of [the report, well 1997 was before the BSE Inquiry
exploded the prior culture of MAFF secrecy, and maybe the FSA and MAFF, and
now DEFRA, have not talked to each other on this issue!
Anyway, it is difficult to see how a new attempted survey 4 years later by
FSA will produce a more useful result. Some of the media rhetoric relating
to the supposed lack of data has implied that it is thwarting efforts to
protect the health of the UK population. Greater knowledge about
consumption patterns of MRM in the past may or may not prove to have a
bearing on the solutions of mysteries (variant CJD age-related incidence
and differing North/South incidence) and on prediction of future numbers of
cases -- as may also the pattern of consumption of 200 000 cattle brains
purchased from retail butchers per annum in the 1980s -- but, important
though knowledge of consumption patterns is, it really does not have a
bearing on the health of the population. The practice of obtaining MRM from
bovine backbone was (belatedly, as highlighted in the BSE Inquiry Report)
addressed by a ban in 1995, and by stringent enforcement of a number of
controls from August 1996. Any harm to public health through consumption of
any MRM-containing fragments of spinal cord had already been done, and will
not be prevented now by deriving these MRM data.
