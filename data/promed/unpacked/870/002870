[A local] grower will be ripping out 8000 trees at his pear orchard and burning them. They will be pulled out because 80 per cent are infected with fireblight. As many as 500 tonnes of pears have been harvested at the orchard in good years recently. This year [2016] only 150 tonnes were saleable.

The orchard had always had some fireblight, he said, but it was under control. Then the trees were weakened by flood, and staff were unable to get to some because of mud. The fruit set looked brilliant, but by November [2015] the extent of the disease was clear. A consultant has said the orchard is finished.

The region once had 13 pear growers, [now this] leaves just 3 smaller pear orchards.

[Fireblight is caused by the bacterium _Erwinia amylovora_ and is considered the most destructive disease of pome fruit trees worldwide. Many varieties of pear, quince, and apple are susceptible, although the level of susceptibility may vary with cultivars. Only members of the _Rosaceae_ are affected, mainly the sub-family _Maloideae_ (synonym _Pomoideae_), but also many cultivated rose and bramble varieties. The known host range covers more than 140 species from 40 genera. Many ornamental and weed species serve as pathogen reservoirs for crop infections.

The name of the disease is derived from the symptoms of blackening of the leaves as if they were scorched by fire. Affected shoots bend forming black hooks; some fruits may show lesions; cankers appear on branches and trunks and trees invariably die. The bacteria enter the host plant through wounds and are highly infectious. They are spread by insect activity (including pollinators), wind, water (rain, irrigation), mechanical means (tools, orchard workers), and with plant material (including budwood). Importation of plant material including fruit (shipments may also contain contaminated leaf or twig fragments) from areas with endemic fireblight poses a considerable quarantine risk.

The bacteria overwinter almost exclusively in cankers on limbs infected during the previous season and, consequently, the amount of inoculum and thus the risk of outbreaks are increased following years with high fireblight levels. Phytosanitation and monitoring are used to attempt exclusion of fireblight from individual orchards. Disease management may include cultural measures (such as removal of pathogen reservoirs) and bactericidal sprays. Certain cultivar/rootstock combinations may provide some protection. Currently, the most effective control is application of streptomycin during flowering, but the use of antibiotics in agriculture is mostly subject to strict regulations.

The pathogen is considered a major biosecurity risk in areas where it does not yet occur and has been included in the quarantine lists of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO). A continued spread of _E. amylovora_ to new areas and the emergence of new streptomycin resistant strains are a major concern to pome fruit industries worldwide.

In the report above, increased humidity would have favoured the spread of the pathogen as well as disease development, while at the same time access to trees for spraying at crucial times was limited. High levels of fireblight are currently also being reported from southern Germany and USA (see links below).
