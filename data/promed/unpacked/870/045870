From: Stuart A. Kirsch <skirsch@umich.edu>
It has been suggested that Tanah Merah, [the site of the Dutch prison camp
for Indonesian political dissidents during World War II, was the point of
introduction for tuberculosis to New Guinea. Tuberculosis is endemic
throughout the border region, to the point that virtually everyone shows
symptoms of infection at some point in their lifetime. The drought has
surely had an impact on hygiene and presumably on transmission of
infectious disease; the famine has probably exacerbated the consequences of
disease as well.

[Thanks to Stuart Kirsh for the historical perspective. In the two
previous postings of this thread data indicating that 155 cases of
tuberculosis have occurred in 25 villages having a combined population of
3,000 to 5,000 people. In the (02) posting, Budi Subianto presented a
"correction" that the case detection rate in Irian Jaya was 155/100,000. I
should have pointed out that these presentations of data are not
necessarily in conflict, if all 155 cases occur in the Lake Sentani area of
a region with a total population of approximately 100,000. - Mod.ES
