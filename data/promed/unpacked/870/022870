African swine fever [ASF] has hit farmers in Mai Mahiu [Nakuru County], leaving at least 80 pigs dead. Government officers have engaged pig farmers to stop the deaths. The Department of Livestock has banned the movement of pigs. The pigs were found dead in 2 farms on the Narok-Mai Mahiu Road. A farm worker said 10 pigs were found dead on Wednesday [14 Aug 2013] evening.

"We thought they had consumed something poisonous but we were left in shock after waking in the morning to find 70 more dead," he said. Speaking on the phone, Naivasha district veterinary officer Enos Amuyunzu said the situation has been contained. He said quarantine has been declared in Mai Mahiu. "It's true some pigs have died but we have put up measures to avoid more deaths," he said. Amuyunzu said samples of the affected animals were taken to laboratories in Nairobi for further analysis.

Nakuru county director of public health Samuel King'ori said they have launched an inspection of meat joints at Mai Mahiu trading centre. King'ori asked residents to desist from eating uninspected pork. "We have sent our officers on the ground to inspect food joints in the area," he said. King'ori said it will be easy to contain the situation as only a few farms were affected. Last month [July 2013] farmers in Murang'a lost herds of pigs following an outbreak of African swine flu.

ASF is endemic in East Africa; Kenya reported to the OIE outbreaks in domestic pigs during 2010, 2011, and 2012.

In the absence of laboratory confirmation, the event described is being regarded as "suspected". ASF cannot be differentiated from classical swine fever (hog cholera; CSF) by either clinical or post-mortem examination, and both diseases should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any acute febrile haemorrhagic syndrome of pigs. Bacterial septicaemias may also be confused with ASF and CSF. Laboratory tests are essential to distinguish between these diseases.

The above and the following information are mainly based upon the 2012-updated ASF chapter in OIE's Manual (http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.08.01_ASF.pdf).

"As no vaccine is available, the presence of ASFV antibodies is indicative of previous infection and, as antibodies are produced from the 1st week of infection and persist for long periods, they are a good marker for the diagnosis of the disease. The early appearance (from 7 to 10 days post-infection) and subsequent long-term persistence of antibodies make antibody detection techniques, such as ELISA, immunoblotting or IFA (indirect fluorescent antibody) test, very useful in diagnosing the subacute and chronic forms of disease.

"ASF epidemiology is complex with different epidemiological patterns of infection occurring in Africa and Europe. ASF occurs through transmission cycles involving domestic pigs, wild boars, wild African suids, and soft ticks. In regions where _Ornithodoros_ soft-bodied ticks are present, the detection of ASFV in these reservoirs of infection contributes to a better understanding of the epidemiology of the disease. This is of major importance in establishing effective control and eradication programmes.

"ASF is not a zoonotic disease and does not affect public health."

Since, at present, there is no vaccine for ASF, its prevention and control rely solely upon biosecurity measures, relying entirely upon preventing contact between the virus and the susceptible host. In order to do so it is necessary to understand the way in which the virus is transmitted and spreads. By implementing strict biosecurity measures that place barriers between the source of virus and the pigs it is possible to prevent infection. However, this has implications for free-ranging pig husbandry systems that are widespread in developing countries.
