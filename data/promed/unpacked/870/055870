The Ministry of Health is reporting that the number of new cases of
malaria in the Greenwich Town Area of Kingston continues to rise.
However, it is insisting that the outbreak of the disease in other
areas of the Corporate Area is under control. Speaking at Monday's
Post Cabinet Press briefing, Information Minister Donald Buchanan
told journalists that the Health Ministry is working feverishly to
reduce the number of new cases of malaria.
The Health Ministry has said that it will be taking precautionary
measures to ensure that the outbreak is contained in the affected
communities. Last weekend it stepped up its vector control programme
with Greenwich Town being among 6 communities targeted in the
Corporate Area. Latest figures from the Health Ministry show more
than 200 cases of malaria have been reported since last month.

The Ministry of Health continues to remain confident that the malaria
outbreak is under control. Speaking yesterday (22 Jan 2007), at the
weekly post-Cabinet press briefing at Jamaica House, Minister of
Information and Development, Donald Buchanan told journalists that
Cabinet received an update from the Minister of Health, Horace Dalley.
"The Minister has basically indicated continuing progress in terms of
the elimination and containment of the outbreak of malaria, but
indicated that in the Greenwich Town area of Kingston there had been
an unusual level of cases in the last couple of weeks and this has
somewhat exacerbated what otherwise, is a continued programme of
containment," he said.
Mr. Buchanan said that the Ministry had reported that, "it is now
fully on top of the situation." Since the outbreak of malaria in a
few areas in Kingston, the Ministry has worked feverishly to
implement a number of strategies to control the disease. These
include house-to-house surveys in the affected areas; prompt
treatment of suspected cases; vector control; public education and
inter-sectoral collaboration.

[Publication of new cases week by week would help knowing whether the
outbreak is under control or not. Clearly with a vector borne disease
with an incubation period of at least 10 days, new cases will
continue for some weeks. - Mod.EP]
[ Jamaica has remained free of endemic malaria for more than 50
years. Previously the vector was_Anopheles albimanus_ There are, I
believe, only 4 _Anopheles_ species on Jamaica, and I imagine that
the present vector is again _An. albimanus_, which incidentally is a
very efficient malaria vector in much of Central America.
_Anopheles albimanus_ breeds in fresh or brackish waters such as
pools, puddles, marshes, ponds and lagoons, especially habitats
containing floating or grassy vegetation. Adults bite people and
domestic animals both indoors and outdoors, at night. After
blood-feeding the adults rest mainly indoors, but the extent of
this will in part depend on the types of houses.
I understand that control directed at the vector involves mainly
spraying breeding places with insecticides and some fogging with
insecticides to kill the adults, also the [distribution] of
insecticide-treated bednets. All these measure are appropriate, but
it would be interesting to learn what insecticides are involved in
these operations. Mod. MS]
