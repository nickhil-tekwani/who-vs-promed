Surveillance Program - Mosquito Testing Season Wraps Up
The State of Connecticut today announced the final set of mosquito test
results for the 2000 season. With these results, the state will conclude
the mosquito trapping and testing surveillance program. The State will
complete the wild bird surveillance program in the next week with test
results available by the end of November. The risk to humans is low, and is
continuing to decline as the state experiences colder weather. No spraying
is planned. Residents are asked to reduce their exposure to mosquito bites
until a sustained hard frost occurs.
Mosquito Surveillance
For the week of 7 Nov 2000, the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station
(CAES) trapped, identified, and tested 86 mosquitoes from 48 sites
statewide, collected on 27 Oct 2000. All were negative for West Nile Virus
(WNV) and Eastern Equine Encephalitis virus (EEEV). The 2000 season total
is 137 199 mosquitoes trapped and tested statewide, with 14 isolations of
WNV and no isolations of EEEV.
Wild Bird Surveillance
Since 31 Oct 2000 (the last full WNV bird report), 28 birds have tested
positive for WNV, 2 from 2 new towns and 26 from towns with previous
positives. These birds were collected from 20 Sep 2000 - 24 Oct 2000. As of
7 Nov 2000, some 1105 birds have tested positive for WNV this year - 1095
crows and 3 blue jays, 2 robins, one dove, one finch, one sparrow, one
Canada goose, and one cowbird - in 109 different communities in all 8
Connecticut counties. Since 31 Oct 2000, a total of 4 additional birds
tested positive for EEEV, bringing the total to 10 birds; 9 crows and one
wild turkey from 9 towns. Only mosquitoes can spread EEEV to humans. To
date, all mosquitoes have tested negative for EEEV. The virus grows in
birds that live in freshwater swamps and is generally found only in these
birds and in mosquitoes that do not bite people. The risk of getting EEEV
is highest from late July through September. The virus is spread by adult
mosquitoes, which are killed by frost in the fall. Birds, people, or horses
that have the disease cannot spread the virus to humans.
Domestic Animal Surveillance
Equines: 33 horses; 7 positive (1-Hebron, 1-Milford, 1-Bethel/Danbury,
1-Middlefield, 1-Cheshire, 1-Newtown, 1-Glastonbury), 26 negative. The USDA
Veterinary Services in conjunction with the Connecticut Department of
Agriculture (DoAg) will be conducting horse serum surveys in the areas
around the positive WNV horses. The information collected will be used to
assess WNV activity in the area.
Birds: 26 Domestic birds; 16 Negative, 10 Pending. The birds reported today
were tested for WNV at the Department of Public Health (DPH) Laboratory and
The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station. The DPH coordinates the
collection of information on bird mortality, which includes reports of
sightings of dead birds and the testing of dead birds for WNV. The
susceptibility of crows to infection and death from WNV provides an
indication to the presence of this virus in Connecticut. Surveillance for
WNV in wild birds is one of several surveillance systems used to determine
if WNV is present in an area and if amplification of WNV poses a heightened
threat to people.
Mammals: 1 Dog, 1 Cat, 2 Llamas, 2 Sheep, 1 Rabbit, 1 Guinea Pig, 1 Goat -
all negative.
The State Mosquito Management Program
The State Mosquito Management Program is coordinated by the Department of
Environmental Protection (DEP) in collaboration with The Connecticut
Agricultural Experiment Station, the Department of Public Health,
Department of Agriculture, and the University of Connecticut. As part of
the mosquito management program, the DEP maintains a 24-hour information
line at (860) 424-4184 that is updated daily with the latest mosquito and
bird testing results. Information can also be found on DEP's web site at
<http://dep.state.ct.us>. Residents may also contact their towns for more
information.
Mosquito Summary: As of 7 Nov 2000, the state reports 137 199 mosquitoes
have been tested for West Nile Virus (WNV) and Eastern Equine Encephalitis
virus (EEEV). One isolation of WNV was confirmed in Westport in the
bird-biting mosquito species _Culiseta melanura_, collected on 2 Oct 2000.
A total of 4 isolations of WNV have been confirmed in Milford (2),
Fairfield (1), and Shelton (1). The mosquitoes were collected in Milford on
21 Sep, Fairfield on 19 Sep, and Shelton on 20 Sep 2000. A total of 3
isolations of WNV have been confirmed in Stamford (2) and Milford (1). The
mosquitoes were collected in Stamford on 20 Sep and in Milford on 18 Sep
2000. A total of 2 isolations of WNV have been confirmed in human-biting
mosquitoes in Meriden and Stamford. The mosquitoes were collected in
Stamford on 11 and 13 Sep 2000 and in Meriden on 12 Sep 2000. One isolation
of WNV has been confirmed in human-biting mosquitoes in Greenwich. The
mosquito pool was collected on 30 Aug 2000 from a trap near of the Civic
Center. A total of 3 pools of bird-biting mosquitoes have been confirmed
for WNV, one isolation in Stamford (reported on 21 Jul 2000) and 2 in
Norwalk (reported on 16 Aug and 22 Aug 2000). All mosquitoes were negative
for EEEV. A total of 20 isolations of Highlands J virus in mosquitoes has
been reported, 4 in Shelton, 4 in Monroe, 3 in Stonington, 3 in Guilford, 2
in North Stonington, one in Darien, one in Manchester, one in Stratford and
one in Old Lyme. The Highlands J virus does not produce disease in humans
and is not considered a veterinary threat.

Date: 9 Nov 2000
New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services, Test Results as of 9
Nov 2000 [edited
<http://www.state.nj.us/health/cd/westnile/enceph.htm>

Human Testing
In total, blood and/or spinal fluid samples from 55 residents have been or
are in the process of being tested for the presence of WNV. To date, 4
tests were positive, 36 were negative, 14 are pending and 1 individual
declined testing. These individuals either had symptoms or signs that met
the established WNV testing criteria or exhibited most of the symptoms and
are from counties where dead crows and/or mosquitoes with the virus have
been discovered.
New Jersey's positive human cases include an 82-year old Little Falls man
who became ill 3 Sep 2000, was admitted to a hospital 3 days later, and
died 14 Sep 2000. New Jersey's other human cases include a 43-year old
Jersey City man, a 54-year old man with dual residency in Brooklyn, N.Y.,
and Cliffside Park, Bergen County, and a 72-year old Bayonne woman. All 3
individuals have either recovered or are recovering.
Crow, Hawk & Falcon Testing
To date, the Department of Health and Senior Services' lab in Trenton has
accepted 2046 birds for testing. A total of 1125 birds (1122 crows, a blue
jay, a great horned owl and a cockatiel) found in 18 counties have tested
positive for the presence of WNV. Positive birds have been found in
Atlantic (3), Bergen (196, including a great horned owl), Burlington (15),
Camden (11), Cape May (5, including a blue jay), Essex (105), Gloucester
(7), Hudson (64), Hunterdon (6), Mercer (11), Middlesex (228), Monmouth
(158, including a cockatiel), Morris (57), Ocean (24), Passaic (85), Salem
(1), Somerset (38) and Union (111) Counties.
In addition, avian testing conducted by the New Jersey Division of Fish &
Wildlife has detected WNV in wild bird specimens in 8 counties. Positive
birds have been found in Bergen (1 merlin & 1 red-tailed hawk), Cape May (1
American kestrel), Gloucester (1 red-tailed hawk), Hudson (1 crow),
Middlesex (1 blue jay), Monmouth (1 red-tailed hawk), Passaic (1 crow), and
Union (2 crows, 1 Cooper's hawk, and 1 blue jay) Counties.
Mosquito & House Sparrow Testing
Some 53 mosquito pools collected in Bergen (22), Essex (2), Hunterdon (1),
Middlesex (3), Monmouth (3), Ocean (1), Passaic (11), Sussex (6), Union
(1), and Warren (3) Counties have tested positive for the presence of WNV.
In total, 14 329 mosquito pools from all 21 counties have been collected by
the Rutgers Mosquito Research and Control Unit and tested by the Department
of Health and Senior Services and/or the CDC.
In addition to mosquitoes, the CDC also analyzed blood samples taken from
541 house sparrows collected in Bergen, Passaic and Sussex County in late
July. No sparrows with WNV were discovered in New Jersey.
Sentinel Chicken Testing
This season blood samples were taken weekly from sentinel chicken flocks
placed in all 21 counties and tested by the New Jersey Department of
Agriculture for the presence of WNV. To date, 4 chickens, stationed in
Essex, Middlesex, Morris and Sussex Counties, have tested positive for WNV.
The National Veterinary Services Lab (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa, has confirmed
the test results.
Horse Testing
In total, 27 horses from Atlantic (3), Bergen (1), Burlington (2), Cape May
(1), Gloucester (1), Hunterdon (2), Middlesex (1), Monmouth (9), Ocean (2),
Salem (2) and Sussex (3) Counties have tested positive for WNV. Equine
testing is conducted by the New Jersey Department of Agriculture's animal
health laboratory in Trenton and results are sent to NVSL for confirmation.
A total of 7 horse deaths have been attributed to the virus.
Late Season Surveillance & Testing Plans
As mosquito season draws to a close and the potential for WNV infection
ends, statewide surveillance and testing activities for the year will be
discontinued. Active human surveillance (a weekly hospital reporting system
of suspect human cases) ended on 31 Oct 2000, and state lab testing for WNV
in humans will end on 30 Nov 2000. Crow submissions from northern and
central counties (including Mercer and Monmouth) ended on 31 Oct 2000,
while submissions from southern counties will continue through the end of
November.
The sentinel chicken flocks have been retired and routine WNV mosquito
surveillance for the season has been discontinued. County government
agencies, however, will continue appropriate surveillance for general
mosquito control.
