The CDC has asked GeoSentinel to disseminate the following advisory of
importance to international travelers in the pediatric age group. The
implicated vaccine was only distributed within the US but children who
received doses may now be spread throughout the world. It is also
possible that vaccine purchased in the US may have been sent by
various multi-national entities to sites overseas.

Children Under 2 Years Of Age May Need To Receive Additional
Diphtheria Booster Prior To International Travel
Anyone planning international travel should be up to date on their
diphtheria and tetanus vaccinations. Recently CDC has become aware of
a
problem with the potency of the diphtheria component of a specific lot
(Connaught Lot No. 1694732) of Tripedia DTaP vaccine; this lot was
distributed in 1998 for use in young children. Consequently, if you
are planning to travel with small children under the age of 2 to
high-risk areas for diphtheria (the former Soviet Union, Albania,
Haiti, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Brazil, Philippines, Indonesia,
and many countries in Africa and Asia),
please call your physician to see if your child needs an additional
dose of diphtheria vaccine prior to departure. Additional detailed
information and a list of high-risk countries is available on the
National Immunization Program webpage:
<http://www.cdc.gov/nip/announce/default.htm>
1) FDA announces voluntary recall of Tripedia DTaP vaccine lot 0916490
on 27 Jan 1999;
2) new recommendations from CDC/AAP/AAFP for children who
received doses from this lot;
3) and a related detailed Q&A document are available from this
Web-site.
