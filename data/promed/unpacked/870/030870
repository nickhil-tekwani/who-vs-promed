in a kindergarten in Estonia, May 2008. Eurosurveillance 2008; 13(24): 1]
-------------------------------------------
The Estonian Health Protection Inspectorate (HPI) is investigating an
outbreak of salmonellosis in a kindergarten in Harju County. As of 28 May
2008, 94 salmonellosis cases had been reported, including 85 children and 9
employees of the kindergarten. Of the 94 cases, 71 were
laboratory-confirmed for _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Enteritidis and 23
were shown to be epidemiologically linked.

Salmonellosis is the commonest foodborne disease in Estonia. In 2007, 428
cases were notified, resulting in an incidence of 31.9 per 100 000
population. Of the 428 reports, 65 cases (15 per cent) were linked to 3
outbreaks at birthday parties.

Outbreak investigation
----------------------
The epidemiological investigation of the current outbreak was launched on
12 May 2008, when the HPI received information from West Tallinn Infectious
Diseases Hospital that 2 children from a kindergarten in Harju County had
been admitted to hospital with symptoms of gastroenteritis. In one child,
_Salmonella_ group D was isolated.

An outbreak investigation team, set up jointly with the Veterinary and Food
Board (VFB) Harju County Service, conducted an inspection of the
kindergarten. A case was defined as a person who had attended the
kindergarten between 7 and 13 May 2008, had had meals in the kindergarten
between 7 and 9 May 2008, and had developed symptoms of diarrhea, vomiting,
and abdominal pain with fever.

Stool samples were taken from the children and all members of staff.
Several food items found in the kitchen of the kindergarten, including
frozen whole hens from Lithuania, were sampled and tested for pathogens,
and samples from utensils and working surfaces were collected for analysis.
A questionnaire was designed containing questions about the onset of
disease, symptoms, and food items consumed in the kindergarten. The
retrospective cohort study is still ongoing and the analysis of the data
collected has not yet been completed.

Preliminary results
-------------------
By 28 May 2008, a total of 94 salmonellosis cases had been reported,
including 85 children aged 2 to 7 years and 9 members of the personnel
including one kitchen worker. The earliest date of onset of disease was 8
May 2008, the latest 19 May 2008.

The cases notified on 8, 9, and 10 May were primary cases related to
consumption of a suspected meal; the cases notified on 11, 12, 13, 14, and
19 May were secondary _S._ Enteritidis-positive cases infected by
environmental contact. The epidemiological curve for these cases is shown
in the figure [see URL above. - Mod.LL].

Some 88 patients (94 per cent) developed clinical symptoms, and 6 (6 per
cent) were asymptomatic but tested positive for _S._ Enteritidis. It is not
known when these 6 patients were infected, and their epidemiological
importance to the outbreak will be investigated. Five children were
admitted to hospital; all have recovered.

Of the 94 reported cases, 71 (64 children and 7 staff members) were
laboratory-confirmed for the organism and 23 were shown to be
epidemiologically linked. _S._ Enteritidis was identified in the frozen
sample of a whole hen from Lithuania. The human and food isolates were sent
for phage typing and genotyping to the National Public Health Institute in
Finland. The laboratory investigation is still ongoing.

The preliminary results of the cohort study indicate that the outbreak was
foodborne and the probable vehicle of infection was a chicken soup that was
served for lunch on 7 May 2008. Cross-contamination during food handling is
also possible: ingredients of the soup with poultry meat could have been
prepared and processed with contaminated utensils or had contact with
contaminated working surfaces.

Control measures
----------------
The following steps were taken to control the outbreak
- all kindergarten and kitchen personnel were tested for salmonella;
- children and personnel were allowed to join the kindergarten activities
only after a negative laboratory investigation result;
- the public was informed about the outbreak via the media and HPI's website.
The Estonian VFB informed the European Commission Directorate-General for
Health and Consumers' (DG SANCO) Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed
(RASFF) and the Lithuanian State Food and Veterinary Service about the
positive result of salmonella testing of the frozen whole hen's sample. The
suspected food vehicle was removed.

[It is not stated in this posting how many children ate the presumed
vehicle so that an attack rate cannot be calculated. Adequately cooking a
hot soup is more than likely enough to kill the pathogen so that either
inadequate cooking or post-preparation contamination occurred.
