According to a recent report in "Qingdao Morning News", fishermen in
Shandong's Jimo City discovered a large number of seagull corpses
that had appeared on the beach. Local fishermen immediately reported
the situation to relevant authorities in Jimo City.
Official personnel rushed to the scene to investigate, and cleanly
disposed of the nearly 1000 dead seagulls. The cause of this mass
seagull death has yet to be determined. Concerned experts suspect
that the seagulls died of illness but have already ruled out the
possibility of avian flu.

On the morning of 17 Dec 2006, an employee of Jimo, Shandong's
Livestock Quarantine Center of the Animal Husbandry Bureau said that
a large quantity of dead seagulls were discovered on 12 Dec. It can
now be confirmed that the deaths were not caused by avian flu. It is
thought that the seagulls ate rotten sea cucumbers and other strange
items, giving rise to disease transmission.
Moreover, with regard to data that the number of dead seagulls was
above 1000, this may have been estimated based on investigations with
nearby villagers. The actual number of seagulls sent to the
Quarantine Center was only 72.

[Mass deaths in seagulls are likely to be caused by intoxication,
including botulism (generally type C); laboratory results will help.
