The city of Lubbock Health Department confirmed on Tuesday [12 Oct 2010]
the 1st case of St Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) [infection] for 2010. It
is Lubbock County's 1st case since 2004. The Lubbock County infection was
in a non elderly woman who did not develop a brain infection, said Beckie
Brawley, public health coordinator for the Health Department.

Between 1964 and 2007, 1015 cases of SLEV were confirmed in Texas said
Steve Presley, an associate professor at Texas Tech's Institute of
Environmental and Human Health. Cases were reported on the South Plains as
far back as the 1940s, and there were outbreaks in 1963 and 1964, he said.
The 2010 case is unlikely to indicate an epidemic, since cooler weather has
caused mosquito numbers to decline, Presley said.

The city is also spraying for mosquitoes, Brawley said. But anyone
experiencing symptoms should contact a doctor, she said. "The mosquitoes
will be out and about until the 1st freeze," she said.

[St Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) is a flavivirus endemic in the USA
closely related to West Nile virus. SLEV is transmitted from wild birds to
humans by _Culex_ mosquitoes, and causes sporadic outbreaks and scattered
individual cases.
