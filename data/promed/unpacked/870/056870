[1] Saudi Arabia, 4 new cases, 3 deaths - MOH 9 Mar 2015

As of 12 Noon, today 9 Mar 2015 there have been a total of:
945 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV, including
408 deaths
512 recoveries, and
25 currently active cases including 2 on home isolation

In the past 24 hours there have been:
4 newly confirmed cases
3 newly reported fatalities, and
1 newly reported recovery

Information on newly confirmed cases:
1- Riyadh: 48-year-old Saudi female, non-healthcare worker, currently in critical condition, history of pre-existing co-morbidities, no history of high-risk exposures in the 14 days preceding onset of illness (no animal exposure, no contact with suspected/confirmed cases in either healthcare environment or community).

2- Riyadh: 37-year-old Expat male, healthcare worker, currently in stable condition, history of pre-existing co-morbidities, history of possible exposure to suspected/confirmed case(s) in healthcare environment currently under investigation, no history of animal exposure or contact with case(s) in the community.

3- Riyadh: 48-year-old Saudi female, non-healthcare worker, currently in critical condition, history of pre-existing co-morbidities, no history of high risk exposures in the 14 days preceding onset of illness (no animal exposure, no contact with suspected/confirmed cases in either healthcare environment or community).

4- Riyadh: 61-year-old Saudi male, non-healthcare worker, currently in stable condition, history of pre-existing co-morbidities, no history of high risk exposures in the 14 days preceding onset of illness (no animal exposure, no contact with suspected/confirmed cases in either healthcare environment or community).

Information on newly reported deaths:
1-Riyadh: 41-year-old Saudi male, non-healthcare worker, history of pre-existing co-morbidities. [This case was most likely reported as newly confirmed case by MOH on 11 Feb 2015 at which time he was noted to be in critical condition. At the time of initial report, a possible history of contact with case(s) in the healthcare environment was under investigation. According to the WHO confirmation report this individual developed symptoms on 7 Feb 2015 while admitted to hospital since [27 Jan 2015], after being referred from another hospital due to unrelated medical conditions. The patient had no history of contact with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases in either hospital as none of the facilities had MERS-CoV cases at the time of his visits." see prior ProMED post MERS-CoV (26): Saudi Arabia, new cases, deaths, WHO, RFI 20150225.3186568 - Mod.MPP]

2- Riyadh: 75-year-old Saudi male, non-healthcare worker, history of pre-existing co-morbidities [reported by MOH as confirmed case on 24 Feb 2015 at which time he was noted to be in critical condition. At time of confirmation there was no history of high risk exposures. - Mod.MPP]

3- Riyadh: 61-year-old Saudi male, non-healthcare worker, history of pre-existing co-morbidities [Reported by MOH as confirmed case on 1 Mar 2015 at which time he was noted to be in critical condition. At time of confirmation was noted to have a history of contact with a suspected/confirmed case in the community. - Mod.MPP]

Information on newly reported recovery:
Riyadh: 64-year-old Expat female, non-healthcare worker, history of pre-existing co-morbidities [reported by MOH as a confirmed case on 1 Mar 2015 at which time was noted to be in stable condition. At time of confirmation there was no history of any known high risk exposures. - Mod.MPP]

[Newly confirmed cases continue to be reported, with 4 new cases and 3 new fatalities reported in the past 24 hours, bringing the total number of newly confirmed cases reported during the 1st 9 days of March 2015 to 25 and the total number of newly reported deaths during the same period to 13. Of the 25 newly confirmed cases during the period 1-9 Mar 2015, 20 (80 percent) were reported from Riyadh. Of the 25 newly confirmed cases, 4 gave a history of contact with suspected/confirmed case(s) in the healthcare environment and an additional 7 had a possible history of contact with case(s) in the healthcare environment -- suggesting that nosocomial spread is still a significant factor in MERS-CoV transmission. The case fatality rate continues to be approximately 43 percent. Of the 4 newly confirmed cases today, it appears as though cases no. 1 and no. 3 are almost identical: same location, same age, gender, nationality. The only difference between the 2 cases is that one gave a history negative for all known high-risk exposures, whereas the other has a possible history of contact with case(s) in the healthcare environment.

While preparing this report (and other reports in the past), the review of the WHO follow-up confirmation report on the newly reported fatality case no.1 above, I was struck by "According to the WHO confirmation report this individual developed symptoms on 7 Feb 2015 while admitted to hospital since [27 Jan 2015], after being referred from another hospital due to unrelated medical conditions. The patient had no history of contact with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases in either hospital as none of the facilities had MERS-CoV cases at the time of his visits." The thought that came to mind was to change the text to read: "The patient had no history of contact with ***known*** laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases in either hospital as none of the facilities had ***known*** MERS-CoV cases at the time of his visits. One can't help but wonder how many less severe respiratory illnesses seen in the healthcare environment are not tested for MERS-CoV, as they do not necessarily meet the existing case definitions for a more severe clinical illness.

[2] Germany ex UAE - WHO 9 Mar 2015

On [7 Mar 2015], the National IHR Focal Point for Germany notified WHO of 1 case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection.

Details of the case:
The case is a 65-year-old male German citizen who returned on [8 Feb 2015] to Germany from Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. He developed symptoms on [10 Feb 2015] and was hospitalized in an intensive care unit one week later. The MERS-CoV infection was laboratory confirmed on 2 samples; the latest sample was taken on [5 Mar 2015]. Currently, the patient is in a severe but stable condition.

All necessary, recommended, preventive and control measures have been applied since [23 Feb 2015] at the hospital where the patient is being treated. Contact tracing of all possible contacts is ongoing for this case. So far, no additional cases have been identified.

Globally, WHO has been notified of 1041 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 383 related deaths.

[The additional information provided in the above WHO confirmation of the case is that the individual had onset of illness on 10 Feb 2015 and was hospitalized in an ICU (intensive care unit) 1 week later (approximately 17 Feb 2015), and had 2 samples that confirmed MERS-CoV. It does not mention if the laboratory confirmation was based on PCR testing of lower respiratory specimens or if it was based on 2 serology specimens looking for a change in antibody levels consistent with an acute infection. It is now approximately 4 weeks since the onset of illness in this individual.

More information on the epidemiologic and laboratory investigations surrounding this case would be greatly appreciated -- such as possible high-risk exposures while in the UAE, types of laboratory tests leading to confirmation of infection, and numbers of presumed close contacts.
