Molecular evidence for a new potyvirus species in yam (_Dioscorea_
spp.) on the island of Guadeloupe
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prevalence of yam potyviruses in the French Caribbean island of
Guadeloupe was evaluated in 142 samples collected from yams showing
symptoms of mosaic and mottling and belonging to _ Dioscorea
rotundata_ (52 samples), _D. alata_ (52 samples), and _D. trifida_
(38 samples). Samples were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) with universal potyvirus monoclonal antibodies and by
immunocapture reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
(IC-RT-PCR) for the specific detection of _Yam mosaic virus_ (YMV)
and _Yam mild mosaic virus_ (YMMV).
Of the samples, 15 percent were positive in the broad-spectrum ELISA
used but negative in both the specific IC-RT-PCR tests used,
suggesting one or more other potyviruses might be present in the
ELISA-positive samples. The highest proportion was in _D. rotundata_
(29 percent), followed by _D. trifida_ (13 percent), and _D. alata_
(4 percent). In an attempt to characterize those potential yam
potyviruses, total RNA was extracted from one _D. trifida_ sample and
universal potyvirus degenerate primers were used to amplify the core
and C-terminal region of the coat protein (CP) and the 3'untranslated
region (3'UTR), which are commonly used as markers of genetic
relatedness of potyviruses.
Sequence information generated from the cloned fragments was compared
with sequences of other potyviruses by a BLAST [Basic Local Alignment
Search Tool] search and by pairwise sequence comparison carried out
on 209 potyviruses sequences. The partial amino acid (aa) sequence
available for the CP (152 aa) had the highest similarity with
_Zucchini yellow mosaic virus_ (ZYMV; 66 percent identity) whereas
the 3'UTR (126 nucleotides) had the highest similarity with _Potato
virus Y_ (PVY; 35 percent identity). Sequence comparisons of the CP
(aa) and 3'UTR with YMMV isolates, YMV isolates, and _Japanese yam
mosaic virus_ (JYMV) isolates showed the highest similarity at the
amino acid level (62.5 percent identity) with the JYMV CP and highest
similarity of the 3'UTR with YMMV (32 percent identity).
According to molecular taxonomy, this isolate should be regarded as a
distinct member of the genus _Potyvirus_ (family _Potyviridae_) and
was tentatively named Dioscorea mosaic virus.

[Yam (_Dioscorea_ spp.) is an important tuber crop in Africa, the
West Indies, and parts of Asia and southern America. Multiple viral
infections are common in field plants and may lead to severe disease
due to viral synergism (see ProMED-mail 20070624.2042). The
predominantly vegetative propagation of yam increases the chance of a
build-up of viruses.
Viruses so far found in yam include _Dioscorea latent virus_ (genus
_Potexvirus_), _Cucumber mosaic virus_ (genus _Cucumovirus_),
_Dioscorea bacilliform virus_ (genus _Badnavirus_), _Dioscorea
dumetorum virus_, _Dioscorea trifida virus_, YMV, YMMV, and JYMV (all
genus _Potyvirus_). ZYMV and PVY mentioned in the note above are
potyviruses, which are widely distributed but have not been reported from yam.
YMV is the most important and most prevalent virus infecting
_Dioscorea_ spp. in the tropics. It has been reported from several
African countries and the Caribbean. Symptoms include mild mosaic and
stunting of plants. Resistant yam cultivars are being developed for
different regions. JYMV causes similar symptoms on yam species in
Asia. YMMV is spreading in West Africa, Guadeloupe, and Guyana. It
causes mild mosaic and vein-banding symptoms, which are often transient.
The genus _Potyvirus_ (family _Potyviridae_) is transmitted by aphids
and mechanical means. It is the largest of the plant virus genera and
contains many species seriously affecting a wide range of crop
plants. Many of the species have a narrow host range. Disease
management includes resistant host cultivars if available, clean
planting material, and vector control.
