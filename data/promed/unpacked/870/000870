Maryland researchers predict bad year for fish-threatening algae
-----------------------------------------------
State researchers predicted on Monday [16 May 2005] that this summer could
rank among the 5 worst in 20 years for algae blooms that threaten fish and
other marine life in Chesapeake Bay.
Scientists and ecologists believe a 10-mile-wide algae bloom on the Potomac
River could begin in early June 2005 and last for 2 and a half months. On a
graphic distributed at a news conference on Mon 16 May 2005, the predicted
bloom appears about halfway up the river, which empties into Chesapeake
Bay. Read the full story to get the details.
"We're trying to predict the location, timing, duration and the extent of
this bloom."

used for recreational purposes may be unsafe to be in, as some of the
