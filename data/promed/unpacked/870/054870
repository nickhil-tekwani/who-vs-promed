Bovine tuberculosis in Upper Allgaeu
------------------------------------
Since the end of 2012, Upper Allgaeu authorities have operated surveillance covering all the district's cattle holdings to study the bovine tuberculosis situation, suspected to be endemic in view of cases discovered in slaughtered animals. The study addresses also the possible role of wildlife (such as deer) in the epidemiology of bTB in the district. Germany has managed to maintain its status as bTB-free since 1997, in spite of the detection of sporadic cases. Since screening [by tuberculin testing] has been discontinued, subclinical cases can be identified, since 1997, only by meat inspection at slaughter. 3 such cases have been detected in the past year [2012].

To determine whether these individual cases represent the tip of an iceberg, it has been decided to carry out a surveillance, to cover -- until the end of 2013 -- the total of about 2100 cattle holdings in the district and in the city of Kempten.

By 14 Mar 2013, 755 cattle-holdings had been examined, 569 recognised as free, while in 143 holdings there is suspicion of bovine tuberculosis (caused by _Mycobacterium caprae_) [previously _Mycobacterium bovis_ subsp. _caprae_; see ref 1 - Mod.AS]. In other words, from about 90 000 cattle in the Upper Allgaeu, 26 000 have been tested so far, of which 531 cattle, or about 2 per cent of them, have been found infected and been removed from the premises. The rate of infection is developing, so far, evenly. An update of these numbers is expected in April [2013].

Since early March [2013] the current test procedure has been revised, becoming faster (no need for an additional blood test). This "simultaneous test" is, however, significantly more expensive. Its further application is currently under discussion, as well as other aspects of the issue, legal ones included.

As part of an EU project, since 2011 wildlife is also being tested for infection with TB. Out of 479 deer shot during 2012, 21 have been found to be infected with the same pathogen as in cattle (_M. caprae_). The highest infection rate was found in Oberstdorf: 17 per cent (excluding fawns). A connection with the infection in cattle has neither been proven nor excluded.

[The article further discusses food (milk and meat) safety issues related to the infection].

Tuberculosis is an infectious bacterial disease. It can occur in humans and animals. The "human" tuberculosis is, in most cases, independent from animal infection since it is caused by a different species (_M. tuberculosis_). _M. caprae_ is regarded as less pathogenic to humans than _M. bovis_. An infection is not completely excluded, but the risk is extremely low. In Upper Allgaeu, no cases of _M. caprae_ in humans have been registered [however, see ref 3].

[Upper Allgaeu (Oberallgaeu) is a district in southern Bavaria, Germany, bordering the Austrian Tyrol on its south; see map at http://tinyurl.com/ck3sfcd.

Sporadic cases of bTB have been reported in recent years also from cattle farms in the 2 Austrian provinces bordering Bavaria, Tyrol and Vorarlberg (ProMED-mail archive no 20121125.1423321). This may be indicative of the presence of a wildlife bTB reservoir which is common to both countries. At the end of November 2012, a newspaper in the Austrian province of Vorarlberg, reported the detection of bTB in a dairy farm in Germany's Upper Allgaeu, and the decision to destroy all 17 cows on the farm (ProMED-mail archive no 20121127.1426225). In fact, the _M. caprae_ issue in the said German-Austrian region and its impact on cattle and human health are not new (ref 2,3). Outbreaks of bovine tuberculosis have been reported by Germany to the OIE throughout the years (2005 - 5 outbreaks, 2006 - 5, 2007 - 13, 2008 - 23, 2009 - 23, 2010 - 11, 2011 - 0). According to the current report, 3 outbreaks were recorded in 2012.

The following additional information from Germany has been kindly provided, following our request, by communicator Sabine Zentis:

"The German outbreaks of _M. caprae_ are so far restricted to regions bordering the Alps; wildlife is suspected as the source of infection. Intensive monitoring (in Bavaria and parts of Baden-Wuerttemberg) are planned for regions along the Alps, priority given to holdings which are sending their youngstock onto common grazing during the summer months as well as the farms which move all their cows to higher pastures during the summer to produce the famous cheese and other products there.

"It is planned to test all animals older than 12 months in the whole of Bavaria by the end of the year (2013).

"The role of wildlife as bTB reservoirs has become a matter of discussion between farmers and the organized hunters. During the winter months, red deer are kept and fed in enclosures. This leads to rather crowded conditions and a massive increase in the deer population and to weaker deer (infected with TB?) since animals which would otherwise die somewhere in the Alps during the winter, are kept alive and might become an ongoing source of infection. One of the sites suspected to enhance infection are the mentioned enclosures, where sometimes young cattle are housed for several days to become adapted to the Alps.

"Of the about 1500 red deer shot during the season, so far only about a third has been tested, the samples of the remainder are kept frozen awaiting testing.

"The change in the testing regime is interesting; so far, when reading the single skin test every inconclusive/positive animal had a blood sample taken on the day of reading and this sample tested with the Bovigam test (gamma IF). The blood samples were sent to different laboratories; results in many cases were not identical. Currently, Bovigam is no longer used, the animals tested with the comparative skin test.

"An interesting paper about surveillance of red deer in Austria is available at http://www.hindawi.com/isrn/vs/2012/245138/."

Thanks to Sabine for the complementary information above.

According to chapter 2.4.7 ("Bovine tuberculosis") of OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals 2012, "Disease caused by _M. caprae_ is not considered to be substantially different from that caused by _M. bovis_ and the same tests can be used for its diagnosis. In countries with tuberculosis eradication programmes, clinical evidence of tuberculosis in cattle is seldom encountered because the intradermal tuberculin test enables presumptive diagnosis and elimination of infected animals before signs appear." Are cases of _M. caprae_ to be considered, for international trade purposes, by the same criteria as _M. bovis_ (or, as named by some, _M. bovis_ subspecies _bovis_)? The advice of compatible authorities, such as national and/or OIE's laboratories (there are 3 of them: in Argentina, France, and UK), will be appreciated. - Mod.AS
