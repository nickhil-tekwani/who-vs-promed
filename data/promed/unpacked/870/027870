FAIRFIELD HOSPITAL (MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA) CLOSURE ANNOUNCED
============================================================
[The following item has been received for posting and is posted
as received. - Mod.]

Melbourne Australia 18/1/96

The Victorian State Government has recently announced that Fairfield Hospital,
Melbourne, will be closed during 1996 and its services relocated. (The
press release of the announcement can be viewed at
http//www.dpc.vic.gov.au/pressrel/8096.htm).

Fairfield is a specialist Infectious Diseases Hospital with extensive
laboratory facilities (the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference
Laboratories) including the Commonwealth High Security Laboratory, Australia's
only dedicated facility for handling biosafety level 4 human pathogens.
The Macfarlane Burnet Centre for Medical Research is also located on the same
campus.

Through the close association between the clinical and laboratory staff,
Fairfield Hospital has been able to make a significant contribution to the
diagnosis and management and research of infectious diseases, particularly in
the fields of Hepatitis, HIV and associated opportunistic infections,
and mycobacteriology. Fairfield has also served as the State's primary centre
for the investigation and management of imported and newly emerging
infections, and plays an important role in local disease surveillance and the
advanced training of health professionals from the Asia-Pacific region.
A Medline search using the terms "Fairfield" and "Australia" can provide a
more detailed view of the Hospital's recent scientific output.

To date, the future of the hospital clinical and laboratory services has not
been determined, but staff fear that the HIV clinical services, the non-HIV
infectious disease services and the laboratories may be split up between the
state's hospital networks. Without a critical mass, it is feared many of the
diverse functions of the clinical and laboratory service will be lost,
particularly expertise and laboratory facilities for the diagnosis and study
of diseases of low incidence (at present) in Australia.
Support is sought from the international infectious diseases community,
particularly those who have visited, or have had scientific collaboration with
Fairfield, to inform the State Government of the value of preserving an
integrated clinical-laboratory infectious disease service following
re-location.

If you wish to comment, please let the Victorian State Government know your
views by writing to:

The Hon Marie Tehan MP,
Minister for Health,
Dept of Health & Community Services
