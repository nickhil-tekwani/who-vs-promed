Re: Measles - Canada: (New Brunswick)
-------------------------------------
Public Health authorities in New Brunswick, Canada are investigating a cluster of 3 laboratory confirmed cases and 1 probable case of measles in Health Region 2 in New Brunswick (Saint John and southern New Brunswick area). Cases include 3 family members with an additional case whose potential contact with this cluster is being investigated. The earliest date of onset of illness for cases is 18 Feb 2013 and the latest is on 3 Mar 2013. The age range of cases is from 11 months old to 39 years old. All affected individuals are unvaccinated. There has been a history of travel to a resort in Mexico between 5 Feb 2913 and 12 Feb 2013 with flight connections in Toronto Pearson airport. Regional Public Health in Saint John, NB is conducting follow-up of cases and their contacts.

[The previous report in this thread (Measles - Canada: (ON) ex Mexico, alert 20130307.1576156) described a laboratory confirmed case of measles virus infection in an Ontarian resident returned from vacation in Mexico, and suspected to have contracted the infection in the resort area of Playa del Carmen. The report above describes a cluster of measles cases in New Brunswick involving persons recently returned from vacation in an undisclosed region of Mexico. These events suggest that there is a risk of measles transmission currently in one or more resort areas currently in Mexico and travellers are advised to ensure that their vaccination status was up-to-date.

However, in the interim Janice Chang (Division Director, Health Promotion/Disease Control Macomb County Health Department Mount Clemens, MI, USA) asked: "But have there been any reports of measles transmission amongst residents of Playa? Or is the source another vacationer in the area? This is a very relevant question. So far we have not been able to determine the prevalence of measles in this region of Mexico."

Of note, according to information available on both the PAHO (Pan American Health Organization) and WHO websites, autochtonous transmission of measles has been eliminated in Mexico. Data available for measles case surveillance in recent years, shows there were 23 cases reported in 2006, 0 cases reported in 2007/2008/2009/2010, and 3 cases reported in 2011. One suspects that what may be going on is importation of cases into Mexico, possibly from Europe countries where measles is currently endemic/epidemic, with subsequent transmission to other tourists.

A comment from anyone with relevant information would be welcomed. - Mods.CP/MPP
