Virus Infection Closes School in South Wales
--------------------------------------------
A school has been closed after around 170 children contracted a viral
infection, a [local school] council confirmed today. Coedffranc Junior
School in Skewen was closed yesterday after more than half the children at
the school became ill.
A spokeswoman for Neath Port Talbot County Borough Council said that around
40 children were ill on Wed 9 Oct 2002. By Thursday morning only 134 out of
the 300 children at the school turned up for classes and a further 10 became
ill during the course of the morning. The spokeswoman said: "A decision was
taken by the health authority and the council to close the school as a
precautionary measure." The premises have been cleaned and disinfected, and
environmental health officers are investigating the cause of the infection.
She added: "At the moment we do not know the exact cause but we can say that
it is a viral infection." The children all suffered from vomiting but are
recovering. It is understood that the school will reopen on the morning of
Mon 14 Oct 2002.

[The sudden onset, the nature of the illness, and the rapid recovery all
suggest that this is an outbreak of the "winter vomiting disease" which has
been afflicting hospitals, health care institutions, schools, and other
closed communities in many parts of the UK and Ireland throughout the
summer. It remains to be seen whether this is the tail-end of the previous
winter's series of outbreaks or the harbinger of the next. The viruses
associated with outbreaks of gastroenteritis of this type are caliciviruses,
belonging to the genus bearing the provisional designation "Norwalk-like
viruses". The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses has recently
approved the genus name _Norovirus_ for these viruses. It now would be
appropriate also to remove the word "winter" from the description of the
illness, since it seems to occur to greater or lesser extent during all
seasons. - Mod.CP]
