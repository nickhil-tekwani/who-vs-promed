Soldiers link baby deaths to jabs
----------------------------------------
The NGVFA is demanding an inquiry to investigate whether there is a link.
Some UK Soldiers who served in Iraq have expressed fears for their
unborn babies after claiming a number of child deaths are linked to
anthrax jabs. There have been 2 miscarriages, 3 premature births, one
still-birth, and a medical termination associated with one Hampshire
unit [so far in 2004]. At least one of the parents had received the
anthrax jab in each case.
A spokeswoman for the MoD said there was no link between a higher
rate of congenital disabilities and vaccines.
The National Gulf Veterans and Families Association (NGVFA) is
calling for a public inquiry into the deaths. It follows claims that
women in the first Gulf War were advised by the Army not to conceive
children for at least one year after they or their partner received
the vaccine.
A total of 105 soldiers from the Gosport based 33 Field Hospital were
stationed on the Kuwaiti-Iraqi border and then Basra at the beginning
of 2003. The unit includes medics, chefs, Royal Engineers, drivers,
clerks, and quartermasters.
Charles Plumridge, spokesman for the NGVFA, said several worried
parents-to-be had called him. He said: "I had several calls yesterday
on our helpline from mothers and husbands whose wives are now
pregnant and are worried their babies may be born with some form of
defect. One woman was due in 4 weeks and she was very, very irate.
They were all inoculated for Gulf War Two with anthrax and all the
other vaccines associated with the Gulf."
Among the cases is Lance Corporal Andy Saupe's son, who was born 10
weeks premature with growth problems and limb defects. Baby Kye
survived only 5 weeks before his life support machine was switched
off. L/Cpl Saupe, a 23-year-old Army chef, had 2 anthrax injections
before being deployed to the Gulf. His wife Alex, 25, became pregnant
weeks later but the foetus did not develop properly.
An MoD spokeswoman said: "The vaccine has been given to both civilian
and military personnel for many years without any clinical evidence
of long-term ill effects as a result. Congenital disabilities are
unfortunately common -- affecting about one in 33 live births." She
said a number of studies showed a high rate of congenital
disabilities of children born to 1991 Gulf veterans, but these were
not connected to vaccination programmes.
"The authors concluded they were unable to determine whether the
higher rate was due to inherited, or environmental factors or due to
chance. There's no link between the higher rate and vaccines," she
said.

Parents whose children have troubles at birth grieve terribly. It is
natural for them to look around for an explanation for why their
lives have been disrupted so. Because unvaccinated parents will have
miscarriages or give birth to children with birth defects, we must
expect vaccinated parents to have the same unfortunate experience.
With regard to the US-licensed anthrax vaccine, we know from
published studies that women vaccinated against anthrax conceive and
give birth to healthy children at the same rate as unvaccinated women
(Wiesen et al. JAMA 2002;287:1556-60). Men vaccinated against
anthrax have sperm of comparable quality and quantity as unvaccinated
men (Catherino et al. Fertility & Sterility 2002;78(Suppl 1);O-285).
We await a final report from a collaborative project between the U.S.
Naval Health Research Center (NHRC) and the Centers for Disease
Control & Prevention (CDC) regarding birth defects and anthrax
vaccine that involves chart review. That collaborative project
responds to preliminary data from a computer-based analysis that
raised a tentative signal that there may be an association with an
increased rate of birth defects if anthrax vaccine was given during
pregnancy; the same analysis showed no elevation in risk for
vaccination before pregnancy. This signal is being investigated
thoroughly, to determine which of several explanations for the signal
is most likely.
Both the US- and UK-licensed anthrax vaccines are inactivated
vaccines, composed of the kinds of proteins that men and women
encounter during everyday life. Because the anthrax vaccine is a
sterile, cell-free (filtered) bacterial vaccine, it is non-infectious
and is not expected to cause any harm to the fetus.

[This is an old problem when one has striking numerator events and
the denominator is either ignored or so small as to distort any
comparisons. In veterinary medicine I have not seen any specific
reports of negative impacts on livestock in the literature or from
farmers, and God knows we vaccinate more cows than the military its
solders. Plus we now have plenty of women in the military. It was a
regular question I would be asked when lecturing to the US Air
National Guard about being vaccinated and an obvious concern.
Now this is the UK vaccine ... and the second such negative
journalist report on their vaccine in almost as many weeks. Is there
a pattern? No, but if one was a conspiracy theorist, one would be
having a great time. Many thanks to John for his detailed report.
