Nearly 1900 people in the northern province of Yen Bai have been infected with rabies [more likely 1900 possibly exposed - Mod.MHJ], and 3 have died after being bitten by dogs since the beginning of the year [2014].

The local authorities noted that the disease has spread in the province and has affected all districts and Yen Bai city. On average, 5-6 new rabies infections [exposures] are being reported every day. Le Thi Hong Van, director of the provincial Preventive Medicine Centre, said that the number of people coming for rabies vaccination had increased year after year.

She noted, however, that lack of awareness among some people, including the ethnic groups in remote areas, has had deadly consequences. She cited the example of a 44 year old man who was asked to go to the district medical centre for rabies vaccination after being bitten by an infected dog in March [2014]. He refused to go and instead took some medicine. He died a month later.

To prevent further spread of the disease, the Preventive Medicine Centre has requested its districts to step up preventative measures against rabies, has forbidden people from transporting dogs and cats across districts, and has asked for increased communication about the disease.

[Yen Bai province is in the middle of Northern Viet Nam; see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yen_Bai_Province. Yen Bai is a mountain province characterised by rugged mountainous scenery and green rice paddy fields in the valleys, an ideal place for rabies to flourish, both in the village dogs and in the surrounding wildlife. From the wording of this announcement, the central authorities would like to see a more active rabies vaccination programme in the districts but are not offering support funding. - Mod.MHJ
