It will take at least two weeks to make a precise diagnosis of the disease
that has infected the population in a number of some villages in Darwaz
District (northeastern Afghanistan on Tajik-Afghan border) of Badakhshan
Province of the Islamic State of Afghanistan, Asia-Plus news agency learned
on 2nd March from a World Health Organization (WHO) epidemiologist,
(?Thomas Grain). Since 26th February Grain and his colleague (?Tokaki
Oyama)have been carrying out research in the disaster zone. The WHO experts
visited the villages of Jamarj-e Bolo, Warwaj and Yashtak (all in
northeastern Darwaz District), where, according to their statistics, from
60 to 80 per cent of the population had contracted the disease. In the
village of Jomarj-e Bolo alone 61 people have died of the disease.
Specimens of the virus have been sent for thorough analysis to the WHO
headquarters in Geneva and to organization's office in Islamabad. Thomas
Grain said that the preliminary clinical picture of the disease was
reminiscent of a type of acute respiratory disease. There are no medical
centres in the disaster zone, nor any doctors and medicines, either. Mr
Grain reported that a group of WHO medical staff and a consignment of
medicines will be sent to Darwaz soon from the Afghan (town of) Fayzabad.
International nongovernmental organizations accredited in Tajikistan held a
meeting in Dushanbe on 1st March at the WHO representative office, where
they discussed how to provide urgent medical aid to those suffering in
Darwaz District of the Islamic State of Afghanistan and also preparations
for a long-term programme to supply medicines to the region.
