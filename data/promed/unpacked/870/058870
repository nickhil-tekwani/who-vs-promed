A total of 2 flocks of birds at the recently concluded Central Washington State Fair were infected with bird flu, but health officials say it's a strain that has not been shown to infect humans.

On [Fri 6 Oct 2017] evening, the Yakima Health District sent local medical providers a notice about the possible exposure to fairgoers.

"The avian influenza viruses identified in 2015 to the present in U.S. birds are not known to have caused human illness but similar viruses have caused human illness in other countries," the alert said.

Health District administrator Andre Fresco spoke with a zoonotic specialist at the Department of Health [Fri 6 Oct 2017] night, who confirmed the concern with this low-pathogenic avian influenza strain lies in bird-to-bird transmission.

If birds contract avian flu, they need to be put down because of the risk of the virus spreading through the flock, Fresco said.

The Health District routinely sends alerts to medical providers if there is an uptick in a certain disease or a concern about an illness that may not be commonly seen here.

The 2 flocks of birds testing positive for avian flu were from Lewis County, not Yakima County. They were tested on 28 Sept [2017] but the Health District did not learn of the results until [Fri 6 Oct 2017].

The U.S. Department of Agriculture did the testing, although it's unclear where the testing took place, whether at the fair or at a farm before the birds were brought to the Yakima fairgrounds. The state Department of Agriculture is following up with the birds in Lewis County, and the Health District is working with fair directors to contact other exhibitors whose flocks may have been exposed.

Health District administrator Fresco did not know what kind of birds were involved.

In avian flu strains that do affect humans, symptoms show up one to 10 days after exposure. With low-pathogenic strains such as this one, symptoms are the same as for normal human flu: cough, fever, body aches, weakness and fatigue, and sometimes sore throat, runny nose, chills and difficulty breathing.

It is always important for people to wash their hands after handling animals, especially before eating or putting their fingers in their mouths, which can be difficult with small children, Fresco said.

If anyone is concerned they may be experiencing symptoms, Fresco said, they should speak with their medical provider.

[The strain of avian flu most frequently identified in the US in 2016 was a low pathogenic H7 (generally H7N2), but HPAI H7N8 was also seen. The most frequently identified strain in 2015 was highly pathogenic H5N2. However, we've already seen HPAI H7N9 in Tennessee in 2017 as well as LPAI H7N9 throughout several flocks in the southeastern states indicating the continued risk of AI as well as the diversity of HPAI and LPAI strains that can be spread from wildfowl to commercial poultry operations.

While this article mentions the strain as a low pathogenic AI variant, it could mean we are in for another tough year with avian influenza. As such all poultry producers should be on high alert and actively verifying appropriate biosecurity procedures are in place and being executed correctly. - Mods.TG/JH
