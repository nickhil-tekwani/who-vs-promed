Avian influenza situation in Indonesia - WHO update 8
-----------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health of Indonesia has announced one new confirmed
case of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) virus. The case
is a 29-year-old female, mother of the 2 cases earlier reported from
Bangli district, Bali Province. She developed symptoms on 10 Oct 2011
and died on 17 Oct 2011.

An epidemiological investigation conducted by the Ministry of Health
and local health officers indicated that she lived in an area with
poultry, and household and neighbourhood poultry had died prior to her
children's illness.

Laboratory tests have confirmed infection with avian influenza A(H5N1)
virus. Of the 182 cases confirmed to date in Indonesia, 150 have been
fatal.
