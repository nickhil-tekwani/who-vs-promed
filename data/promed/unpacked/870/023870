Another Ebola Patient Dead, Only One Remains In Isolation Facility
--------------------------------------------------------
Another person has succumbed to Ebola virus disease after a long battle with the deadly fever at the isolation facility at Kagadi government hospital in Kibaale district. This brings the total number of people who have died of the deadly disease to 17. The deceased's identity has however been withheld by the Health Ministry. The Ministry's public relations officer Rukia Nakamatte says since [the patient's admission] to the isolation camp her condition had never improved and her chances of survival were minimal. Nakamatte adds that the deceased was HIV-positive and by the time she contracted Ebola virus disease she had just had an abortion thus making her immune system very weak. She says now only one Ebola virus disease patient remains admitted at the isolation facility.

Nakamatte adds that 3 suspected Ebola virus disease cases are currently undergoing monitoring and their samples have already been taken to the Uganda Virus Research Institute for tests.

[The death toll in the Kibaale outbreak of Ebola Sudan virus infection has risen to 17, with only one other case remaining in the isolation facility and receiving treatment. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection may have been a contributory factor in the death of the 17th case. It will be relevant to establish the HIV-status of the other fatal cases in this outbreak. Three additional cases remain under surveillance. - Mod.CP.
