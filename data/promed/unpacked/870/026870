Brazil has confirmed the occurrence in its territory of a third positive case of super mushroom, also known as _Candida auris_. The authorities declared a state of "local outbreak".

The Brazilian National Health Surveillance Agency (Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária; ANVISA) said that the third person infected is a man, hospitalized in Recife. According to the agency, "actions were taken to contain the spread of the organism in the hospital and there is still another suspected case, which is under investigation". They remarked that, "Although at the moment there are only 3 confirmed cases and another under analysis in Brazil, it can be considered that there is an outbreak of _Candida auris_ in the country."

ANVISA said that the epidemiological definition of an outbreak "covers not only a large number of cases of contagious or health-related diseases, but also the appearance of a new microorganism in the epidemiology from a country or even from a health service, even if it's just one case".

_Candida auris_ causes serious blood infections and spreads among patients in hospitals and nursing homes. The scientists explained that the super mushroom virus [sic; _Candida auris_ is a fungus, NOT a virus. - Mod.ML] poses serious risks for people with compromised immune systems or those hospitalized in intensive care units that require catheters and vascular tubes. The contagion occurs by contact between people and by prolonged contact with surfaces or medical devices contaminated by the strain.

Symptoms include fever and chills, and it is estimated that 1 in 3 infected people dies from a massive infection a month after receiving the diagnosis. If none of the symptoms improve after being treated with antibiotics, a bacterial infection may be suspected. [Or the strain of _Candida auris_ causing the infection could possibly be resistant to the antibiotic being used to treat the infection. - Mod.ML].

The super mushroom resists drugs. _Candida auris_ was first discovered in 2009, when it was found it in the ear canal of a patient in South Korea. [This is not correct. _Candida auris_ was discovered in 2009 in the discharge from the external ear canal of a 70 year old woman in Japan (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1348-0421.2008.00083.x). - Mod.ML]. Subsequently, cases have been found in more than 30 countries, such as the United States, England, Venezuela, Colombia, Israel, Pakistan, Kenya, Kuwait and Spain, as well as Brazil.

[A prior ProMED post (Candida auris - Brazil: (PE) RFI 20220116.8700902) in mid-January 2022 reported 2 cases of urinary tract infection with _Candida auris_ in an unidentified hospital in the Brazilian state of Pernambuco; one case involved a 38 year old male patient and the other, a 70 year old female patient. The above news report adds a 3rd case of _C. auris_ infection in presumably the same unidentified hospital, now said to be located in the city of Recife, capital of Pernambuco. There likely may be additional patients since _C. auris_ tends to spread onto objects and other patients in the initial patient's environment. Targeted screening can identify these patients who may be asymptomatically colonized with _C. auris_ to control further spread. Screening is done by swabbing bilateral axilla and groin, the commonest and consistent sites of colonization, in high-risk patients (https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/candida-auris/c-auris-screening.html). Patients at highest risk include close healthcare contacts of patients with _C. auris_ infection or colonization (https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/candida-auris/tracking-c-auris.html). Patients at high risk of _C. auris_ colonization should be placed on appropriate transmission-based precautions (https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/candida-auris/c-auris-infection-control.html#transmission).

_C. auris_ is often resistant to multiple antifungal medications. _C. auris_ isolates are usually resistant to fluconazole, and many are also resistant to amphotericin B. Because isolates are uncommonly resistant to echinocandins (caspofungin, anidulafungin, and micafungin), echinocandins remain the initial empiric drugs of choice for infections caused by this pathogen, but _C. auris_ can emerge echinocandin-resistant on therapy.

More information from knowledgeable sources on the outbreak in the Pernambuco hospital would be appreciated.

Pernambuco (estimated population of 9.6 million in 2020) is a state located in northeast Brazil; Recife is the capital and largest city (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pernambuco).
