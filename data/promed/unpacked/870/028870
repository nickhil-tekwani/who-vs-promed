Cameroon has reported 28 suspected cases [of monkeypox] with 2 deaths from 4 districts across 3 regions since the beginning of 2022. Of these cases, 3 cases have been laboratory confirmed from Kumba Health District in the South-West (2) and Ayos Health District in the Centre Region (1).

The Central African Republic has so far recorded 17 suspected cases of monkeypox as of 19 May 2022, including 8 confirmed cases and 2 deaths (CFR 11.8%), for year 2022. The confirmed cases were reported from 3 health districts: Mbaiki (6 cases, 2 deaths), Alindao (one case, no death), and Bimbo (one case, no death).

In the Republic of the Congo, since the beginning of 2022, 7 suspected cases with 3 deaths have been reported from Impfondo District in the country's northern department of Likouala on the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo and Central Africa. Samples from 2 cases sent to the National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB) Laboratory in Kinshasa on 12 Apr 2022 were laboratory confirmed.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo has reported 1284 suspected cases with 58 deaths (CFR 4.5%) from 87 health zones across 18 provinces from 1 Jan - 8 May 2022. The most affected provinces account for 71% of the total cases reported in 2022: Sankuru (n=468, 36.4%), Tshopo (169; 13.2%), Ecuador (168; 13.1%), and Tshuapa (108; 8.4%).

[Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is endemic in several countries in the Central African Region, with 4 countries above reporting cases fairly frequently (see ProMED posts listed below). The above report does not indicate which of the 2 clades of MPX virus are responsible for the cases. The reported case fatality rates above are 4.5% and 11.8%, within the usual CFR range for the Central African MPXV clade.

The report does not indicate if the reported cases are due to person-to-person transmission or to contact with infected wild mammals. Monkeys are not the reservoirs of the virus, despite the name that the virus has received. Studies of the prevalence of MPX virus in populations of rodent hosts are not mentioned in this or previous reports. The main reservoirs of MPX virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp, an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_. Halting the bushmeat trade and consumption of wild animals to halt MPX virus exposure will be culturally and economically difficult, so continued occurrence of cases can be expected. MPX virus has been shown to be transmitted between people in Africa, but not readily. - Mod.TY
