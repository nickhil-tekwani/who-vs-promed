1. Lassa fever
Please note that the data reflects the routine reports i.e. all suspected cases including the laboratory positive and negative cases
1.1. Up to 12 suspected cases of Lassa fever were reported from four LGAs [local government areas] (3 States; Edo - 10, Nasarawa - 1 and Plateau - 1) in week 30, 2017 compared with 14 suspected cases with 2 Laboratory confirmed cases reported from 3 LGAs (3 States) at the same period in 2016.
1.2. Laboratory results of the 12 suspected cases are 2 positives for Lassa fever (Edo -2) while 8 were negative for Lassa fever and other VHF (Edo - 8) while 2 pending (Nasarawa - 1 & Plateau - 1).
1.3. Between weeks one and 30 (2017), 366 suspected Lassa fever cases with 88 laboratory confirmed cases and 56 deaths (CFR, 15.30 percent) from 68 LGAs (22 States) were reported compared with 760 suspected cases with 74 laboratory confirmed cases and 87 deaths (CFR, 11.45 percent) from 128 LGAs (27 States) during the same period in 2016 (Figure 1).

1.5.1. National Lassa Fever Working Group meeting and weekly National Surveillance and Outbreak Response meeting on-going at NCDC to keep abreast of the current Lassa fever situation in the country.
1.5.2. Response materials for VHFs prepositioned across the country by NCDC at the beginning of the dry season
1.5.3. New VHF guidelines have been developed by the NCDC (National Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers Preparedness guidelines, Infection Prevention and Control of VHF and Standard Operating Procedures for Lassa fever management) and are available on the NCDC website.
1.5.4. Ongoing reclassification of reported Lassa fever cases
1.5.5. Ongoing review of the variables for case-based surveillance for VHF
1.5.6. VHF case-based forms completed by affected States are being entered into the new VHF management system. This system allows for the creation of a VHF database for the country.
1.5.7. NCDC team sent to Edo State to support Lassa fever data harmonization and Updating of VHF case-based management database
1.5.8. Confirmed cases are being treated at identified treatment/isolation centres across the States with Ribavirin and necessary supportive management also instituted

[Overall, case numbers have increased by 28 confirmed, 3 laboratory confirmed and one death since [Fri 28 Jul 2017].

Once again, ProMED-mail thanks Dr Olutayo Olajide Babalobi for sending in the Epidemiological Report above.

As noted in earlier comments, Lassa fever remains a problem in Nigeria because the virus is endemic there. Virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or their excreta. Transmission also occurs in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed and barrier-nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients.

Images of mastomys mice, the rodent reservoir of Lass fever virus, can be seen at http://www.ispot.org.za/node/255877.
