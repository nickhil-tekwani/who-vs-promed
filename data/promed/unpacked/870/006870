News of the response
Presentation of the revised response plan
--------------------------------
- The Minister of Health, Dr. Oly Ilunga Kalenga, arrived in Beni Thu 18 Oct 2018 to present the new response plan. The operational review of the first 2 months of the response identified the strengths to be consolidated, the weaknesses to be corrected and the risk factors to be considered. Those who also traveled to Beni included Leila Zerrougui, Head of the UN Stabilization Mission in the DRC (MONUSCO), and Kim Bolduc, Deputy Special Representative of the UN Secretary General and Humanitarian Coordinator in the DRC.
- The objectives of this new plan are to strengthen the response capacity for all strategic areas in active households to end the epidemic by the end of November 2018, and to continue monitoring, community engagement, psychosocial care, prevention and control of infections in all affected health areas until the end of January 2019.
- The general principles of the revised strategy are:
-- Implementation of a new co-targeting approach based on integrated multidisciplinary interventions;
-- Accelerated ownership and community engagement;
-- Anchoring the pillars of the response in the local health system and gradually transferring activities to local actors; and
-- Preparation of peripheral provinces to minimize the spread of the epidemic.

Vaccination
------------
- Since the start of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 18 998 people have been vaccinated , including 8422 in Beni [North Kivu], 4391 in Mabalako [North Kivu], 1663 in Mandima [Ituri], 1392 in Katwa [North Kivu], 1085 in Butembo [North Kivu], 630 in Masereka [North Kivu], 434 in Bunia [Ituri], 355 in Tchomia [Ituri], 240 in Komanda [Ituri], 160 in Musienene [North Kivu], 121 in Oicha [North Kivu] and 105 in Kalunguta [North Kivu].

[2] Outbreak summaries
- Thu 18 Oct 2018. Ebola virus disease - Democratic Republic of the Congo
[WHO Emergencies preparedness, response, Disease Outbreak News (DONs); edited]
http://www.who.int/csr/don/18-october-2018-ebola-drc/en/

The response to the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has seen significant improvements over the past weeks, including strong performances by field teams conducting vaccinations, and improved community engagement and risk communication in priority areas. However, as new cases continue to emerge from Beni and appear closer to security "red zones," it is clear that risks remain and that strong response measures need to be prioritized. The virus' spread is partly due to security conditions that severely affect frontline and health workers, at times forcing the suspension of response activities and increasing the risk that the virus may spread to neighbouring provinces and countries. The Ministry of Health (MoH), WHO, and partners continue to rapidly adapt to these challenging circumstances, scaling up all pillars of the response: surveillance, contact tracing, community engagement, laboratory testing, infection prevention and control, safe and dignified burials, vaccination, and therapeutics.

Because of the challenges faced in the DRC, the 1st Meeting of the 2018 International Health Regulations (IHR) Emergency Committee for Ebola Viral Disease in the DRC took place on 17 Oct [2018]. Due primarily to the strength and tempo of current response operations, it was the view of the Committee that the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) have not been met. The Committee further concluded that the current outbreak has several characteristics of particular concern: the risk of more rapid spread given EVD presence in urban environments; that there are several outbreaks in remote and hard-to-reach areas; and that health care staff have been infected. Risk of international spread also remains high because of the outbreak's proximity to significant regional traffic. Logistical challenges due to poor infrastructure continue to affect surveillance, case detection and confirmation, contact tracing, and access to vaccines and therapeutics.

Despite these challenges, the Committee also noted that the response of the government of the DRC, WHO, and partners has been rapid and comprehensive. The Committee concluded that interventions already underway provide strong reason to believe that the outbreak can be brought under control, and that this vigorous response should be supported by the entire international community. A decline in the current level of response would cause the situation to deteriorate significantly. It is particularly important that there should be no international travel or trade restrictions, and that neighbouring countries should strengthen both preparedness and surveillance.

Since the last Disease Outbreak News (data as of 16 Oct 2018), 26 new confirmed EVD cases were reported: 19 from Beni, 3 from Butembo, 1 from Mabalako, 1 from Kalungata, and 2 from Masereka health zones in North Kivu. Of these confirmed cases, 5 have been linked to known cases or transmission chains within the respective communities, while 21 cases remain under investigation.

As of 16 Oct 2018, a total of 220 EVD cases (185 confirmed and 35 probable), including 142 deaths (107 confirmed and 35 probable; note: the number of cases is subject to change due to ongoing reclassification, retrospective investigation, and the availability of laboratory results), have been reported in 7 health zones in North Kivu Province and 3 health zones in Ituri Province (see Fig. 1 in the source file). An increasing trend in weekly case incidence has been observed (see Fig. 2 in the source file). The rising trends are likely underestimated given expected delays in case reporting, the ongoing detection of sporadic cases, and security concerns that limit contact tracing and investigation of alerts. Of the 211 confirmed and probable cases for whom age and sex information is known, the majority (60%) are within the 15 to 44 years of age range. Females (54%) accounted for a greater proportion of cases (see Fig. 3 in the source file). A total of 20 healthcare workers have been affected (19 confirmed and one probable), of whom 3 have died.

The MoH, WHO, and partners continue to closely monitor and investigate all alerts in affected areas, in other provinces in the DRC, and in neighbouring countries. As of 16 Oct [2018], 34 suspected cases in the DRC are awaiting laboratory testing. Since 11 Oct [2018], alerts have been investigated in several provinces of the DRC, as well as in neighbouring countries. To date, EVD has been ruled out in all alerts from neighbouring provinces and countries.

Public health response
----------------------
- The MoH continues to strengthen response measures, with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include coordinating the response, surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory capacity, infection protection and control (IPC) measures, clinical treatment of patients, vaccination, risk communication and community engagement, psychosocial support, safe and dignified burials (SDB), cross-border surveillance and preparedness activities in neighbouring provinces and countries.
- Surveillance: As of 16 Oct [2018], more than 11 000 contacts have been registered, of which 4798 remain under surveillance (note the total number of contacts under surveillance is highly dynamic with new cases being registered daily, and those who complete 21 days of post-exposure follow-up, without developing symptoms, are released from surveillance). Beni health zone presents the greatest challenges in contact tracing due to a combination of factors, including a large and increasing number of contacts, community reluctance and refusal for contact tracing, contacts lost to follow-up, and an unstable security situation. As surveillance activities have been enhanced, responders have seen a significant rise in the number of reported alerts and suspected cases tested each day. Prior to surveillance enhancement (effective 2 Oct 2018), an average of 26 alerts were issued per day (range, 17 to 47), of which 12 (range, 3 to 23) were validated as suspected cases and tested. Since 2 Oct [2018], improved surveillance activities have generated an average of 66 alerts per day (range, 46 to 106), of which 24 alerts (range, 11 to 38) were validated each day.
- Vaccination: As of 17 Oct [2018], 106 vaccination rings have been defined, in addition to 34 rings of health and frontline workers. To date, 18 943 eligible and consented people have been vaccinated, including 7134 health and frontline workers and 4495 children. With the help of community support and risk communication efforts, vaccination teams have nearly doubled the number of vaccinated children over the past month (adding 2133 since 19 Sep 2018, which represents 48% of all EVD-vaccinated children). Overall, vaccination teams have reached an additional 3115 eligible and consented people in the past week alone (10 to 17 Oct 2018; 807 of these were health and frontline workers). The past week's increase almost doubles the average number of persons reached each week (1709; range, 1328 to 2070) between 19 Sep and 10 Oct [2018].
- IPC activities are ongoing in the DRC and are supported by several partners in the field. The Ebola treatment centre (ETC) managed by the Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA) in Beni has increased its capacity to 41 beds. The International Rescue Committee (IRC) has recently strengthened IPC in Beni General Hospital by increasing the number of dedicated medical and WASH staff, instituting daily mentoring and supervision, and constructing improved medical waste management facilities.
- Risk communication, community engagement, and social mobilization continue to improve community ownership of response activities by engaging local leaders and influential community members, such as community chiefs, traditional practitioners, and civil society organizations, to encourage community call-to-action for preventing the spread of EVD and regaining confidence in response organizations. Teams have engaged 66 additional community associations this week who supported response operations in Beni, Butembo, and Mangina. Community dialogue activities continue through house-to-house visits in all affected health zones, and community concerns are addressed at ETCs, during vaccination, during SDBs, at points of entry, during routine surveillance activities, and during the discharge of EVD survivors from the ETC to support their return to the community. Interpersonal communication through house-to-house visits, mass communication through radio and media, and community sensitization activities are ongoing in all affected health zones.
- Current SDB capacity, through Red Cross (RC) and Civil Protection (CP) teams, is operational in Mangina (RC), Beni (RC and CP) Butembo (CP), Oicha (CP), Bunia (RC), and Tchomia/Kasenyi (RC and CP). Trained RC SDB teams in Mambasa and Goma are on stand-by. Security remains a concern in Beni and Butembo; Red Cross SDB activities in Butembo remain suspended until further notice. Training has started for 3 additional SDB teams. As of 17 Oct [2018], a total of 280 SDB alerts were received; of these, 232 were responded to successfully. Forty (40) responses were unsuccessful due to community refusals or burials conducted before the arrival of SDB teams, and one was pending at the time of reporting. A total of 7 SDB alerts have not been responded to due to security concerns. CP teams have responded to 41 alerts (31 successfully). Among all SDB alerts, 41% come from communities, 32% from ETCs, and 27% from other health facilities (non-ETCs).
- Point of Entry (PoE): As of 17 Oct [2018], health screening has been established at 48 PoEs, and more than 9.1 million travellers have been screened. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) continues to support 32 key PoEs in the DRC, with flow monitoring at 16 sites; IOM screening protocol requires a health declaration form, temperature check, observation of symptoms (if any), hand washing, and risk communication. A total of 8 priority PoEs have been identified in Ituri Province, and IOM is supporting PoE staff training and the establishment of a coordinating mechanism among PoEs and border facilities. IOM in Uganda is establishing 10 flow monitoring points along the border with South Sudan and the DRC and has activated 4 PoEs in South Sudan's Yei River State; 4 additional PoEs are being established in Busia, Tokori, and Livolo and Keriowa.
- Partners: To support the MoH, WHO is working intensively with a wide range of multisectoral and multidisciplinary regional and global partners and stakeholders for EVD response, research and urgent preparedness, including in neighbouring countries. Among the partners are a number of UN agencies and international organizations, including European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operation (ECHO); International Organization for Migration (IOM); the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF); UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR); World Food Programme (WFP); United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA); Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC); UK Public Health Rapid Support Team; US Agency for International Development (USAID); multiple clusters, peacekeeping operations, and the UN mission; UN Department of Safety and Security (UNDSS); World Bank and regional development banks; African Union, Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and regional agencies; health cluster partners and NGOs, including the Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA), Adeco Federacion (ADECO), Association des femmes pour la nutrition a assisse communautaire (AFNAC), CARITAS DRC, Centre de promotion socio-sanitaire (CEPROSSAN), CARE International, Cooperazione Internationale (COOPI), Catholic Organization for Relief and Development Aid (CORDAID/PAP-DRC), Harvard Humanitarian Initiative (HHI), International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC Red Cross), International Medical Corps (IMC), Intersos - Organizzatione Umanitaria par l'Emergenza (INTERSOS), International Rescue Committee (IRC), Medair, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), Oxfam International, Samaritan's Purse, Social Science in Humanitarian Action Platform (SSHAP), and Save the Children International (SCI); Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), Emerging and Dangerous Pathogens Laboratory Network (EDPLN), Emerging Disease Clinical Assessment and Response Network (EDCARN), technical networks and operational partners, and the Emergency Medical Team Initiative (EMT). GOARN partners continue to support the response through deployment for response and readiness activities in non-affected provinces and in neighbouring countries and to different levels of WHO.

WHO risk assessment
----------------------
This outbreak of EVD is affecting northeastern provinces of the country, which borders Uganda, Rwanda, and South Sudan. Potential risk factors for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels include transportation links between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries; the internal displacement of populations; and the displacement of Congolese refugees to neighbouring countries. The country is concurrently experiencing other epidemics (e.g., cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis) and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu and Ituri at times limits the implementation of response activities. WHO's risk assessment for the outbreak is currently high at the national and regional levels; the global risk level remains low. WHO continues to advise against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the DRC based on currently available information.

As the risk of national and regional spread is high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. The Emergency Committee has advised that failing to intensify these preparedness and surveillance activities would lead to worsening conditions and further spread. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure that health authorities are alerted and are operationally prepared to respond.

WHO advice
-------------
WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to the DRC based on the currently available information. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international travel to and from the DRC. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

Date of issue: 17 Oct 2018
Data as reported by: 15 Oct 2018

The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) continues to be closely monitored by the Ministry of Health (MoH), WHO, and partners. Significant improvements have been made over the past weeks, including strong performances by field teams conducting vaccinations and improved community engagement and risk communication in priority areas. However, as new cases continue to emerge from both Beni and near Kasenyi, which is in a security "red zone" and close to internally displaced person (IDP) camps, it is clear that risks remain and that strong response measures need to be maintained. This is largely due to security conditions that severely impact both civilians and frontline workers, at times forcing suspension of EVD response activities and increasing the risk that the virus will continue to spread. There is evidence of ongoing transmission within communities, particularly in Beni. For more than half of new cases, investigations are ongoing to establish epidemiological links. Neighbouring countries continue to receive support to improve their readiness capacities for potential threats of EVD. Additional resources are necessary to both expand the response in the DRC and increase preparedness in border nations. The MoH, WHO, and partners continue to rapidly adapt to these challenging circumstances, with more than 250 staff on the ground scaling up all pillars of the response -- surveillance, contact tracing, community engagement, lab testing, infection prevention and control, safe and dignified burials, vaccination, and therapeutics. See original source file for more, including table and figures covering EVD cases by classification and health zones, as well as confirmed and probable EVD cases noted by week of onset, age, sex, and geographical distribution.

- Thu 18 Oct 2018. Uganda at big risk
[CBC, edited]
https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/ebola-risk-of-spreading-congo-to-uganda-1.4868217

Uganda is at big risk of the spread of a deadly Ebola virus outbreak from neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), a senior health official said Thursday [18 Oct 2018], even as he said the situation is "being handled well" there. Uganda's director of health services, Henry Mwebesa, spoke to The Associated Press a day after the World Health Organization said the DRC's outbreak does not yet warrant being declared a global emergency but called for an intensified response.

Uganda is the most threatened as the risk of Ebola's regional spread is high, with confirmed cases discovered in recent weeks near the heavily travelled border. WHO has not recommended any travel restrictions.

Twice-weekly market days during which 10 000 Congolese cross into Uganda have put the country at "big risk," Mwebesa said. Unofficial border crossing points also are a cause for concern.

DRC's health ministry has said millions of travellers have been checked for Ebola at various points of entry since the outbreak was declared on 1 Aug [2018]. Mwebesa said 222 suspected cases of Ebola have been identified and isolated in Uganda among people arriving from the DRC, but none have tested positive. He said travellers arriving from the DRC are screened for a high body temperature.

Uganda has had multiple Ebola outbreaks since 2000. The chair of the WHO's emergency committee on Wednesday [17 Oct 2018] said that if the virus infects another country, that could trigger another meeting to determine whether this outbreak should be declared a global emergency.

DRC's health minister, Oly Ilunga, told the BBC ahead of the meeting that his country did not want the declaration, saying that "I think the situation is quite under control." His ministry, WHO, and aid groups have expressed alarm as the rate of new cases has more than doubled this month amid the threat of attack by multiple rebel groups and sometimes hostile community resistance to health workers in a part of the DRC facing its 1st Ebola outbreak.

- Thu 18 Oct 2018. Uganda: Government to move Ebola screening equipment to Kasese
[New Vision, abridged, edited]
https://www.newvision.co.ug/new_vision/news/1487933/govt-ebola-screening-equipment-kasese

A person suffering from Ebola can infect other people through physical contact with body fluids such as saliva, blood, stool, vomit, urine and sweat from an infected person and soiled clothing. The ministry of health is scheduled to move some of the hi-tech laboratory equipment from Entebbe to Kasese district to facilitate faster screening of persons for Ebola as they cross into Uganda.

Health officials have stepped up surveillance against the deadly disease, which has claimed more than 100 people in neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). A health surveillance team has been deployed at Uganda's border points with the DRC since the outbreak started about 2 months ago. Uganda has had no Ebola outbreak since 2012.

Dr. Henry Mwebesa, the director general of health services, said the health taskforce had so far screened 220 suspected cases of Ebola but none has tested positive for Ebola. On Tuesday [16 Oct 2018], one of the suspected cases admitted to Bwera Hospital was isolated and tested for the disease, but test results were negative, Mwebesa disclosed on Wednesday [17 Oct 2018].

It takes an average of 24 hours to deliver samples from the border points with DRC in western Uganda to Entebbe and test them for the Ebola virus. It takes about 6 hours to drive from Kasese to Entebbe.

Mwebasa said moving some of the hi-tech equipment to western Uganda would significantly shorten the period it takes to confirm the health status of suspected cases. "The minister has directed us to move testing equipment to western Uganda. It will take about 4 hours to confirm whether a suspected case has the Ebola virus," he explained.

The team is also teaching communities about Ebola, to be vigilant and report any suspicious cases for investigation, while health workers have been trained to detect and handle any suspected Ebola case. The joint team is also preparing to undertake vaccination of frontline health workers against infection with Ebola Zaire, the strain causing the outbreak in DRC.

[4] Ebola fight: Beni neighborhood leaders with cell phones
Date: Thu 18 Oct 2018
Source: Radio Okapi [online trans., abridged, edited]
https://www.radiookapi.net/2018/10/18/actualite/sante/lutte-contre-ebola-les-chefs-des-quartiers-de-beni-dotes-de-telephones

Thirty leaders from the neighborhoods of Beni's 4 communes received cell phones as part of the response to Ebola in North Kivu. The epidemic has already killed 104 people in the region.

According to the director general of the fight against the disease and coordinator of the response to the Ministry of Health, Dr. Bathe Ndjoloko, these phones will facilitate alerts if suspected cases are located in the neighborhoods of Beni.

"We have increased the capacity of the leaders of the neighborhoods to be able to notify, to be able to alert us. That's why we gave them these phones with credit so they can report as many cases as possible and take ownership of the fight against Ebola," he said.

The Ebola response team and the heads of neighborhoods agree to work together in the fight against the epidemic. "We are now going to work harder, including with the community relays, all the social actors and civil society, who have also committed themselves as the main actors of this response," continued Dr. Ndjoloko.
