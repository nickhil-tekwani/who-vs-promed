German authorities said Friday [7 Sep 2007] that more than 200 000
ducks would be slaughtered at 2 farms in Bavaria after tests
indicated the presence of the H5N1 strain of bird flu.
The head of Bavaria's state office for health and food safety, Volker
Hingst, said the slaughter was "a purely precautionary measure,"
taken after "laboratory indications of H5N1" were found. The birds
were not visibly sick, he said.
The 2 farms are located near Schwandorf, east of Nuremberg, and have
a total of 205 000 ducks. It was not immediately clear how the virus
might have gotten there.
Last month [August 2007], more than 160 000 ducks were slaughtered at
another Bavarian poultry farm following an outbreak of the disease.
Officials have said that contaminated straw was the likely source in that case.
The 2 businesses affected Friday [7 Sep 2007] are subsidiaries of
that farm, authorities said.

[It will be interesting to know what kind of diagnostic tests were
performed on what kind of samples, and their results, all of which I
am sure will be forthcoming. A map of the farm location can be found at
