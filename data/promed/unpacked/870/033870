The number of people in New York infected by a potentially deadly strain of
E. coli bacteria continued to rise Thursday, as health officials battled
one of the worst recorded outbreaks of the disease in the United States.
State health officials said there have been 497 unconfirmed cases of the E.
coli infection, which causes abdominal cramps and severe bloody diarrhea
and in the worst cases can lead to kidney failure and death. This is up
from 159 cases Tuesday.
So far 51 people have been hospitalized due to the E. coli infection,
including 10 children listed in serious condition.
A three-year-old girl died from the epidemic, believed to have started at
the Washington County Fair in Greenwich, N.Y. Aug. 28-29. Her younger
sister is in serious condition and is receiving kidney dialysis treatment
along with the other nine children, all of whom have Hemolytic Uremic
Syndrome (HUS), the New York State Health Department said.
"What I want ... is for people not to panic," said New York State health
commissioner Antonia Novello at a news conference after she and other
health officials examined the fairgrounds. She said the state health
officials were working with dozens of health agencies in New York and in
Vermont and Massachusetts, as well as the Federal Centers for Disease
Control.
WATER FROM WELL MAY BE CAUSE
The people affected may have caught the [infection after drinking well
water at the fairgrounds contaminated by runoff from a nearby dairy barn.
Investigators are still testing the well water to find a direct link
between the victims and the contaminated water, and Novello said they may
have an answer in three to five days.
About 46 percent of the people infected were between the ages of 20 and 59;
25 percent were 0 to 9 years old, and 11 percent were 10 to 19 years old.
Eight percent were over the age of 60.
HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOMS CROWDED
Health officials warned people who attended the fair but have no symptoms
to call their doctors and to stay away from overworked emergency rooms.
