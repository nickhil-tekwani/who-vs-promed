The ProMED-mail posting has the details correct.
I can provide a little additional background however. The feeder on this
herd recalled finding a dead cat within a round bale of hay. The hay smelled
bad but it was still thrown into a mixing wagon along with several other
components of the TMR [cattle ration. The feed was mixed and then put out
to 4 of 10 pens on the dairy. Only the four pens that were given this load
of feed were involved in the massive die off. Early concerns focused on
other toxins and so extensive feed analysis was performed in the CVDLS-Davis
toxicology labs. The feed samples had very uniform concentrations of all
feed components suggesting very good mixing. No compounds of concern were
found to be present in toxic concentrations. Examination of affected animals
in the field and in the diagnostic laboratory in Tulare brought about the
suggestion that perhaps botulism was involved.
This is when the feeder was questioned and mentioned the information
provided above. A small amount of feed has been tested for botulinum toxin
and the toxin (I believe type C1) was found. Rumen contents from an affected
cow were analysed and cat hair was found.
Testing is currently underway in an effort to find the toxin in samples from
affected cows. Tissues from a total of 10 animals were examined and other
than a single case of Johnes disease and a couple of abomasal ulcers there
were no significant lesions noted. Five of those ten animals were given a
full necropsy in the diagnostic lab and 5 were necropsied in the field by
the veterinarian. We also had a hard time understanding how 400+ cows could
die with botulism in one event but the evidence for uniform feed composition
throughout the load of feed is strong and it takes only a small amount of
botulism toxin to kill a cow. The working diagnosis at this point is
botulism toxicity but it is largely a circumstantial diagnosis until such
time that we can identify the toxin in samples from the cows themselves.

A dead cat infected with botulism toxin apparently caused the death of 418
cows on a dairy near Modesto last weekend. The cat carcass was found in one
of the feeding bins at the Genasci Brothers Dairy on Blue Gum Road west of
Modesto. It may have been picked up in a hay bale and mixed into the feed,
according to Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the California Department of
Food and Agriculture.
The cat carcass tested positive for botulism, one of the most deadly poisons
known. Botulism is not contagious and the remaining herd poses no danger to
the public. Botulism toxin is produced by a naturally occurring bacteria
present in the soil. The bacteria, _Clostridium botulinum_, must have an
oxygen-free environment to produce the toxin.
"The chances of it happening are almost infinitesimal out in the open like
this on a dairy," said Ron Terra, a veterinarian with Lander Veterinary
Clinic in Turlock. "It's the first case I've seen in 15 years of practice."
The toxin attacks the nervous system of an animal that ingests it,
paralyzing respiratory organs. "The cow basically suffocates," Hidalgo said.
Investigators don't believe the cat died of botulism. Some of the bacteria
spores were apparently present on the cat, and the bacteria grew as the
carcass decayed, according to Terra.
Owners from Genasci Brothers Dairy were not available for comment Friday.
The fact that a cat wound up in a hay bale is not unusual. "Small animals
are quite often caught up during baling in the field, as you might imagine,"
said Gary Conover, vice president of governmental affairs for Western United
Dairyman in Modesto. Cats, both pets and strays, are common on dairies, and
the baling process can pick up other animals like rabbits and mice, Conover
said. "Dairymen are always concerned about dead animals around the ranch. It
was a freak thing," Conover said. "The important thing was that the public's
safety was absolutely protected."
Milk from the affected cows was destroyed, and the dead animals were
rendered.
The ranch is being sanitized to make sure the botulism toxin isn't present
before new cows are introduced to the pens, Conover said. The toxin can't be
transferred from one farm to the next, so neighboring farms and the public
shouldn't be concerned about contracting it, Conover said.
The incident began during the early morning hours of April 10, when dairy
workers at the Genasci Brothers Dairy discovered a dead cow and others that
were sick. They called a veterinarian, and investigators from the California
Department of Food and Agriculture were called in when hundreds more cows
became sick and died through the weekend.
Toxicologists at the University of California at Davis worked through the
week to discover what caused the tragedy, finally narrowing the
possibilities down to the dead cat.
For the dairy owners, the incident is a huge financial loss, and much more
than that. Of the 418 cows that died, 184 were milking cows worth about
$1,200 to $1,300 each. The remaining 234 were registered, pure bred
holsteins and Brown Swiss, worth up to $10,000 each, depending on the animal
and the market. But the Genasci Brothers Dairy also lost 40 years of history
in a genetic breeding program, Conover said.
