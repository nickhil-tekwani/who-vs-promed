More than 550 fattening calves have died in recent days at Moshav Kfar Yehoshua in the Jezreel Valley. They were affected by botulism, a disease caused by a toxin produced by the botulinum bacterium in carcasses if the latter are present in animal feed.

Dr. Gil Shavit, a bovine health practitioner, said the appearance of botulism in fattening beef is rare. "For example, a dead snake in piles of peanut feed is sufficient to cause this," he said. In most cases, the phenomenon appears when poultry manure is fed to cattle; such feed may, at times, include dead birds in which the toxin is produced. Shavit explained that though an efficient preventive vaccine, costing a few shekels, is available, "the financial marginal profit of cattle growers is very small, sometimes causing them to save the expense for vaccination."

The damage caused to the owner of the calves in the current case is estimated at NIS 1.5 million [roughly USD 410 000]. As a result, cattle growers from around the country are getting organised to donate calves to him.

The Ministry of Agriculture issued a response to the case, saying that "calves in the moshav Kfar Yehoshua died due to feed intoxication by the botulinum toxin, which causes paralysis of body parts, including the respiratory muscles, leading to death. These calves were in the process of fattening and have not yet reached the phase of their slaughter; hence, no meat from this batch of calves has been marketed. The toxin has been produced by bacteria in the feed, unfortunately leading to the outcome. Laboratory investigations are still under performance. The Ministry of Agriculture is following the investigation, in wait for all results."

Reports of mass botulism intoxications in cattle have been published several times in the past in Israel. One of them, in 1978, caused more than 1000 clinical cases in Israeli dairy cattle following the inclusion of recycled chicken litter, containing remains of dead birds, in cattle feed. Spores of _C. botulinum_ type D, as well as the toxin itself, spread to many farms from the 2 central animal feed plants (Ref 1). The above and additional cases in cattle led the Israeli Veterinary Services to ban the feeding of poultry manure to dairy cattle. On top of the risk of botulism, this measure was applied due to the possible inclusion of public-health hazardous ingredients (e.g., heavy metals, medicines) in this product. It was further required from beef cattle producers to allow slaughter of their poultry-manure-fed animals only 2 weeks after the discontinued feeding of the animals with poultry manure. Vaccination with a toxoid botulinum vaccine C and D is recommended in all farms utilizing poultry litter.

The Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food (ACMSF) in UK's Food Safety Agency established in 2004 an ad-hoc group on botulism in cattle. The group submitted its final report in 2006. One of their main recommendations involved the main source of the toxin, considered to be broiler litter, including carcasses of birds that have died during production. It was speculated that even small fragments of carcasses transferred onto pasture by scavenger animals, such as foxes, dogs, or crows, can pose a risk to grazing cattle.

One of their points of discussion was the official status of the disease in cattle. They concluded: "Reporting botulism outbreaks in cattle is conducted on a voluntary basis. This may result in under-reporting of the disease. However, clinically affected animals are likely to be investigated, and, based on the low apparent risk to humans presented by toxin types C and D, which predominate in recent UK cattle outbreaks, statutory notification does not currently appear to be merited."

They further said that if litter has been spread on silage ground, it is advisable to raise the cutting blades so that the grass is cut less close to the ground. This will reduce the risk of decaying matter being included in the silage cut. Washings from poultry houses and yards should be collected in tanks rather than be allowed to flow onto adjacent land. Annexes 4 and 5 of the report present guidance to farmers on methods for the control of botulism in cattle. Vaccination is recommended, while indicating that it "should not be used as a substitute for preventing exposure of cattle to broiler litter that may contain carcasses."

For subscribers' convenience, we provide extracts from the "Diagnostic Tests" (for animals) chapter in the "Botulism" review published by The Center for Food Security and Public Health at Iowa State University (CFSPH), updated January 2018 (for the entire review, see http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/botulism.pdf):

"A definitive diagnosis can be made if botulinum toxin is identified in environmental samples (e.g., feed), serum, gastrointestinal contents (stomach, crop, or intestines), wounds, vomitus, feces, or tissues such as the liver. Fecal samples are more likely to be diagnostic than serum, which usually contains this toxin only in the early stages of the disease and is rarely positive in some livestock. Repeated fecal sampling may improve detection. Low levels of toxin can be difficult to detect, and a presumptive diagnosis in highly sensitive species (e.g., cattle and horses) must sometimes be based on the clinical signs and the exclusion of diseases with similar signs.

"Botulinum toxin is usually identified with a mouse bioassay (the mouse neutralization test), which can take up to 4 days, but ELISAs and PCR assays may be available in some laboratories. Because ELISAs detect both active and inactivated toxins, false positives are possible with this test. PCR tests may, likewise, amplify some "silent" botulinum toxin genes. Only active toxins are detected in mice. Pre-incubating samples under anaerobic conditions can improve the sensitivity of both ELISAs and PCR. One recent study reported that storing samples at room temperature or 5 deg C (41 deg F), rather than at -18 deg C (0 deg F), reduced the sensitivity of a _C. botulinum_ PCR test, even when the samples were stored for only 48 hours. Other types of assays are also in development, with the goal of replacing the mouse bioassay. Some measure the toxin's activity on synthetic peptides that mimic its targets. Botulinum toxins can be typed during the mouse neutralization test or with genetic techniques.

"Botulism can also be diagnosed by recovering toxin-producing clostridia from clinical samples and/or the suspected source of the intoxication. _C. botulinum_ can be cultured on various solid and liquid media, including blood or egg yolk agar, but anaerobic conditions are required. Heat and/or ethanol treatment, which destroy competing microorganisms but not clostridial spores, may aid recovery in highly contaminated samples such as food or feces. Biochemical tests, morphology, and the detection of volatile metabolic products, using gas-liquid chromatography, are helpful in identification. The metabolic patterns and other characteristics vary with the strain/ group. Definitive identification is by the demonstration of botulinum toxin. Molecular techniques such as multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) or variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) analysis can help determine the source of an outbreak.

Serology is not usually helpful in diagnosis, but antibodies to botulinum toxin have been reported in some animals that recovered, including horses, cattle, and a dog. In the dog, paired serum samples revealed a 4-fold increase in titer. Repetitive nerve stimulation studies have been used to help diagnose botulism in foals."

Botulism in animals is not notifiable in Israel, the UK, or in most countries. Hence, the actual number of events is not available. The UK 2006 report, mentioned above, addressed (in table 1) 67 incidents identified in cattle in England and Wales during the years 2003-2005. The authors advised farmers to report any suspicion immediately to their practitioners. Botulism is not included in OIE's list of notifiable diseases.

From a reliable source we have noted that the current event involves 3-6-months-old imported calves that have shown the initial signs, suspected as botulism, a few days after their release from the quarantine station and introduction into the fattening farm in Kfar Yehoshua. They have not been vaccinated against botulism while their feed included poultry litter. For the location of Kfar Yehoshua, in Hazafon (Northern) district, see https://tinyurl.com/y7fp955p.

A final confirmation of the Kfar Yehoshua event is anticipated.
