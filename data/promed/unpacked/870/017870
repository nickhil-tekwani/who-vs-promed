We describe a case of aseptic meningitis due to Toscana virus
imported to Switzerland and discuss the epidemiological situation. To
our knowledge, this is the 1st description of this infection acquired
on the island of Elba.

Introduction
------------
In Switzerland, aseptic meningitis is frequently encountered and most
often caused by enteroviruses, flaviviruses (tick-borne
encephalitis), herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2, varicella-zoster
virus or mumps and measles viruses. Other arthropod-borne viruses
that can cause clinical signs of meningoencephalitis, such as West
Nile virus, have been detected in other parts of Europe and also in
countries around Switzerland (e.g. Italy, France), but not as yet in
Switzerland itself. Toscana virus (TOSV) was 1st isolated from a
sandfly (_Phlebotomus peniciosus_) in central Italy in 1971 and
identified as a common cause of aseptic meningitis in this country.
Since then, it has been detected in other countries around the
Mediterranean. Studies carried out in Italy have shown that the virus
circulates not only in Tuscany but also in other regions such as
Emilia Romagna, Marches, Umbria and Piedmont [1]. So far, no data can
be found about infections acquired on the islands off the coast of
Tuscany, including Elba.

Case Report
---------
On 10 Aug 2008, a man in his 20s was admitted to the emergency
department of the Hospital of Lucerne, based in the central part of
Switzerland. He suffered from a pronounced headache since the
previous day and recurrent vomiting. He had stayed on the island of
Elba for 2 weeks and returned home on 8 Aug 2008. From 27 to 31 Jul
2008, he had stayed at a campsite east of Portoferraio before moving
to the southern part of the island (near Marina di Campo) for the
remaining week. The entire holiday was spent exclusively on Elba,
with no major stopovers on the way home from Piombino, the mainland
port for the ferry to Elba. At the campsite, the patient usually
slept outside the tent on a canvas chair; the ground was sandy and hard.

On admission, the patient had neck rigidity without clinical signs of
encephalitis or fever. White blood cell count and C-reactive protein
levels were normal. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), taken on the day of
admission, was clear and showed a white blood cell count of 196/mm3
(85 percent mononuclear cells), protein levels of 0.75 g/L, and
glucose levels of 3.7 mmol/L (the glucose level in the blood was 6.9
mmol/L). Gram stain was negative, and culture showed no
microorganisms. PCRs for herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2,
varicella-zoster virus and enteroviruses were negative. Serology for
_Borrellia burgdorferi_ and tick-borne encephalitis virus showed no
signs of active infection.

Because the patient had stayed on the island of Elba, TOSV meningitis
was considered and confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence that
showed high titres of anti-TOSV IgM and IgG, antibodies
("Sandfliegenfieber-Viren-Mosaik," Euroimmun, Lubeck, Germany).
Antibody titres against other sandfly fever viruses (sandfly fever
Naples virus (SFNV), sandfly fever Sicilian virus (SFSV), and sandfly
fever Cyprus virus (SNCV)) were found to be low or negative. Although
a PCR of the CSF taken on the day of admission could not detect TOSV
genome, the negative PCR result does not exclude an acute infection
with TOSV, as the virus rapidly becomes undetectable after the
appearance of antibodies.

The patient recovered completely within 3 days. Apart from analgetic
medication, no further treatment was necessary.

Discussion
---------
TOSV belongs to the genus _Phlebovirus_, family _Bunyaviridae_. The
genus _Phlebovirus_ currently comprises 68 antigenically distinct
serotypes, 8 of which have been linked to diseases in humans. Three
_Phlebovirus_serotypes are of importance in Europe: SFSV, SFNV and
TOSV. While the 1st 2 cause a febrile illness, TOSV is characterized
by its neurotropism and the clinical characteristics of meningitis,
meningoencephalitis and influenza-like illness. As stated in several
studies and case reports, TOSV is circulating not only in Italy but
also in Algeria, Spain, Portugal, France and Cyprus [2-9]. In central
Italy, a seroprevalence of approximately 20 percent could be detected
[10], whereas in Granada, southern Spain, the overall prevalence of
anti-TOSV IgG antibodies was almost 25 percent [11]. In both
countries, the seroprevalence was significantly higher in older age
groups and in the rural population, indicating exposure throughout
life and a higher vector density in the rural areas.

Transmission of the virus to humans results from the bite of small
female phlebotomine sandflies (_P. perniciosus_ and _P. perfiliewi_).
The activity of sandflies is mainly crepuscular or nocturnal. During
the summer months, concomitant with the period of maximum activity of
the sandfly vectors in August, TOSV appears to be one of the major
viral pathogens causing aseptic meningitis in tourists as well as in
the local population of the Mediterranean countries [12].

TOSV infections have an incubation period of 3 to 6 days. The
clinical picture is variable: In addition to meningitis and
meningoencephalitis, few cases of encephalitis without meningitis
have been described [13]. The high seroprevalence suggests that
asymptomatic infection is rather common and TOSV, therefore, probably
under-recognized. In a study performed in the area around Florence,
Siena and Arezzo, forestry workers with high occupational risk of
TOSV infection showed a seropositivity rate of over 75 percent, with
negative history of neurological symptoms. This confirms that TOSV
infection can be very mild or even completely free of symptoms [10].

To our knowledge, this is the 1st description of TOSV meningitis
acquired on the island of Elba. However, the geographic proximity to
areas where the disease is endemic and which have a very similar
climate, suggest that phlebotomes occur on Elba. Despite millions of
visiting tourists and an increasing number of TOSV infections around
the Mediterranean Basin, TOSV is still rarely considered as the cause
of aseptic meningitis in returning travelers. Either it is not
diagnosed, or the manifestation rate of severe infections is very
low. Patients returning from the Mediterranean and also from the
island of Elba and complaining of CNS symptoms should be tested for
TOSV infection.

[TOSV infection may be one of the arboviral diseases extending its
range into Europe as a consequence of climatic change. In view of the
increasing prevalence of the virus and its vector, TOSV infection
should be considered increasingly as cause of aseptic meningitis in
residents and travelers returning from the Mediterranean region.
