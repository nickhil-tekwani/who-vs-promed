Alberta: New Cases of Hantavirus Infection Reported
------------------------------------------------
Albertans are being cautioned to avoid mouse droppings or urine after 2
cases of hantavirus infection were reported to provincial officials last
week. Dr. Karen Grimsrud, Alberta's deputy provincial health officer, said
hantavirus is a potentially fatal infection spread by rodents in their
droppings or urine. "Albertans should be aware they need to take special
care when working or playing in locations that may expose them to rodents,
especially mice, that may carry the hantavirus," said Grimsrud. "There are
likely infected mice in all regions of Alberta."
This year 4 cases of the disease have been confirmed in the province. Since
1989, there have been 27 confirmed cases of the disease in Alberta, with 8
deaths reported. "Hantavirus infection is rare," said Grimsrud, "and only
affects a small portion of people who come into contact with mouse
droppings. The risk of contracting the infection can be reduced even
further by exercising caution." Contact with the virus can come, for
instance, during sweeping to clean up mouse droppings in a barn or garage
or washing the area with bare hands. A mask is recommended to prevent
breathing dust containing mouse droppings, and rubber gloves are urged when
washing the area with disinfectant.
The only confirmed carrier of the disease is the deer mouse, but since it's
possible that other rodents could carry the virus, all of them should be
treated as potential carriers. If a person is infected, the disease usually
appears in one or 2 weeks, but it can take up to 6 weeks to appear.
Symptoms resemble severe influenza, with a high fever, body aches, chills
and troubled breathing. Anyone who develops difficulty breathing and has
been in an area contaminated by rodents should see a doctor immediately.

[Several hantaviruses have been recorded in Canada: _Prospect Hill virus_,
_Bloodland lake virus_, _Topografov virus_, _Sin Nombre virus_, _New York
virus_, _El Moro canyon virus_, _Blue river virus_; all associated with
different species of rodents. Of these viruses only _Sin Nombre virus_ and
_New York virus_ are etiologic agents of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.
Unlike the other Canadian hantaviruses, these 2 are maintained in rodents
of the family _Muridae_, subfamily _Sigmodontinae_. The principal reservoir
of _Sin Nombre virus_ is the deer mouse (_Peromyscus maniculatus_), and
that of _New York_ virus the white-footed mouse (_Peromyscus leucopus_). It
seems likely, therefore, that _Sin Nombre virus_ is the virus responsible
for the cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in Alberta during 2002. -
