Israel: Influenza A Virus Outbreaks Affecting Israel Defense Force Personnel
--------------------------------------------------
The first outbreak was identified on 19 Oct 2003, and as of 28 Oct 2003 has
involved at least 12 cases of acute upper respiratory illness (cough, runny
nose, sore throat) with fever over 37.7 deg C. The onset of illness in the
index case was on 17 Oct 2003. All patients serve on the same military
base. One patient with a history of asthma was hospitalized due to
respiratory distress and blood oxygen desaturation. Nasopharyngeal swabs
were collected from 3 patients early in the outbreak, and 2 were found to
be positive for influenza A virus by PCR and immunofluorescence tests.
Viral typing showed the virus to be an [H3N2] strain.
A second outbreak occurred concurrently on a separate military base located
in a geographic area distant from that of outbreak 1. Outbreak 2 involved
at least 38 patients, 29 of whom serve in a single company numbering some
200 soldiers. The onset of illness in the index case was on 15 Oct 2003,
with most cases presenting at the base clinic over a 3-day period between
21 Oct 2003 to 23 Oct 2003. The clinical presentation was the same as in
outbreak 1. 7 of 11 clinical samples collected in outbreak 2 were positive
for influenza A by PCR, and 2 of these were positive by immunofluorescence.
Viral typing showed the virus to be an H3N2 strain.
Outbreak 3, identified in a small military outpost, was reported on 23 Oct
2003. Outbreak 3 involved 10 patients among a unit of approximately 50
soldiers. One patient was hospitalized and remains under treatment in a
respiratory intensive care unit due to secondary bacterial pneumonia and
[emphysema]. Epidemiologic investigation has traced the onset of illness in
the index case to 15 Oct 2003. PCR performed on a nasopharyngeal swab
collected from the hospitalized patient showed the same strain as in
outbreaks 1 and 2.
These 3 outbreaks were identified and investigated subsequent to reporting
by primary care physicians on the involved military bases. A cooperative
effort between clinicians, epidemiologists and laboratory specialists
facilitated rapid investigation, sample collection, laboratory diagnosis,
viral typing, and public health intervention. Investigative efforts have
been supplemented this year by the establishment of a laboratory-based
febrile respiratory illness surveillance system in collaboration with the
virology unit of the Hadassah Medical Organization.
These are the 1st influenza outbreaks to be reported in Israel this season.
To date, the Epidemiology Department of the Ministry of Health has reported
no outbreaks of influenza in the civilian sector, although influenza A
(H3N2) virus has been isolated from clinical specimens collected from
sporadic cases of influenza-like illness in the cities of Elad and Jerusalem.
In the Israel Defense Force, the annual influenza vaccination campaign was
initiated on 19 Oct 2003, prior to detection of the outbreaks. In light of
the above findings, vaccination schedules have been moved up, in order to
more rapidly reach vaccine coverage among targeted populations.

[This report of the 1st occurrence of influenza in Israel this season is
further confirmation of the predominant role of influenza A (H3N2) virus in
the outbreaks of influenza that are beginning to be reported worldwide.
Early reports suggest that the circulating A (H3N2) virus is antigenically
similar to the A (H3N2) component of the current vaccine. - Mod.CP]
