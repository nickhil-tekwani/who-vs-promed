Epidemic kills tons of fish, local breeders hit hard
----------------------------------------------------
At least 820 tons of goldfish here have died following an unprecedented
epidemic caused by the _Aeromonas hydrophila_ bacterium over the past
month, resulting in Rp 3.2 billion (USD 35.75 million) in losses.
The bacterium has been found to have contaminated the regency's reservoir,
breeding farms, and fishing ponds, head of the protection and health
division at the local agriculture office Bunbun B said on Thursday. He said
that since the first attack of the bacterium was detected on 16 Jun 2002,
his office had asked fish breeders to drain their fishing nets at Darma
reservoir, located 12 kilometers south of here. "The reservoir should be
drained and cleared of the bacterium to prevent it from spreading to the
remaining nets," he said.
Bunbun suggested that new fish breeding be suspended until September to
avoid the effect of poison contained in the substances used to clean the
reservoir.
He speculated that Aeromonas had come from the breeding stock of young fish
brought in from other regencies, notably the neighboring town of Subang.
"It (Subang) is the place where the bacterium was first found. I believe it
has already spread to Central Java, Yogyakarta and East Java," he said.
Separately, agriculture office chairman Kaswan Heryawan admitted that he
had received a report about the epidemic from many fish breeders and the
first district reporting an attack by the bacterium was Pasawahan, followed
by other districts such as Cigugur, Darma, and Kuningan.
He said that, based on the research conducted by the Center of Water
Fisheries in the regency, before being attacked by the bacterium, the fish
were infected with Rhabdovirus, a virus that weakens the fishes' immunity.
"Aeromonas is not a new type of bacterium and can be found everywhere. It
can be lethal if the fish's immunity is weak," he said. "The bacterium will
die within 24 hours if it cannot find a host such as fish gills. Neither
can Aeromonas live at a temperature above 30 degrees Celsius.
Heryawan said that a fish that had been attacked by Aeromonas would show
some white spots on its gills and scales and would die within 3 days. He
suggested that the traders stop trafficking in fish breeding stock in the
regions affected and breed other kinds of fish that were more resistant to
the bacterium until the reservoir water had been declared safe.
Sukarya, a fish breeder in Pasawahan district, said he had lost Rp 6
million [628 USD] to the epidemic while Suharna, who breeds fish at Darma
reservoir, said he had suffered almost Rp 7 million in losses.

[The remarks of Kaswan Heryawan are sound; _Aeromonas hydrophyla_ is
generally regarded not to be a primary cause for disease in fish (or in
other species, humans included) but an accidental, waterborne contaminant.
The severe damage described should be attributed to viral or environmental
factors that have affected the immune system of the fish, predisposing them
to the bacterial infection.
Recently, a major outbreak in Indonesian koi fish, suspected to be caused
by a novel herpes virus (KHV), has been notified to the OIE (see ref).
However, according to accumulated observations from elsewhere, the
suspected KHV has not affected exposed goldfish (H. Bercovier, personal
communication). It would be interesting to get more information from our
Indonesian colleagues about the currently suspected rhabdovirus. - Mod.AS]
