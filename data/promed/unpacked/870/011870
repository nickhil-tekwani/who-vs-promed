Taking into consideration the FMD epidemics in Europe, Hungary has also
introduced, with the effective date of 4 Mar 2001, some measures at the
borders:
1. Ban on animals entering Hungary, particularly when the addressee is in
Croatia, because Croatia closed down her borders completely from this point
of view.
2. Compulsory disinfection of all vehicles at the Hungarian border.
3. Compulsory disinfection of all aircraft which arrive in Budapest
(Ferihegy) airport from an infected country. This measure includes the
destruction (incineration) of all waste and garbage from such aircraft. The
disinfection of the passengers' shoes has not yet been introduced, but if
the situation worsens it will be introduced.
No FMD case or suspected case has been detected at the present moment in
Hungary.

The Belgian ministry of agriculture announced this afternoon that all
limitations implemented this weekend are withdrawn, with the following
exceptions:
The buffer zone around the farm is now 10 km (was 20). Within this zone all
the limitations are still in force.
For the rest of Belgium, 2 measurements [restrictions are still in force:
1. Every farm with even-toed animals must have a container available to
disinfect the feet of visitors.
2. Only essential access of persons and vehicles is permitted to farms.

Alerts in Europe and Asia over foot-and-mouth
---------------------------------------
Britain's Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) crisis spread at home and abroad on
Monday, with France banning exports of animals at risk, other continental
countries testing their livestock, and Asian states cutting European meat
imports.
France, which at the weekend found traces of the disease in slaughtered
British sheep and 2 French cattle in contact with them, also suspended the
transport of all cloven-hoofed animals­-except to slaughterhouses--for the
next 2 weeks.
"There is a considerable potential risk," said Farm Minister Jean Glavany.
"It could be a new tragedy for French farmers."
In Britain, the National Farmers' Union spoke of a possible "nightmare
scenario" as news broke that the disease had been found on a farm in
southwest England owned by Prince Charles. The number of confirmed infected
sites in Britain, where 67 000 animals have been slaughtered in a desperate
bid to stamp out the disease, rose from 52 to 69 on Sunday.
British supermarkets reported soaring meat sales, with shoppers stockpiling
supplies in anticipation of shortages. Much of the British countryside is
now a no-go area, with footpaths, forests and national parks off limits.
France began to follow that example by placing 9 farms under quarantine
inside 10km exclusion zones. Officials said horse-racing events were also
likely to be called off in France, echoing bans in Britain and Ireland
where several sports including rugby union have been hit.
The effects of the crisis were felt as far away as Japan and South Korea,
which restricted meat imports from Europe, and New Zealand, where air cargo
rates for meat shipments to Europe were climbing in anticipation of
increased demand.
FMD, which does not harm humans, causes blisters on the hooves and mouths
of sheep, pigs, cattle, and goats, followed by severe weight loss. No cases
have been confirmed in live animals in continental Europe.
Belgium's Farm Ministry said a suspected case among pigs in the west of the
country had proven negative. Hardly had Brussels given the all-clear,
however, when officials in the German state of Brandenburg said they had
sealed off a pig farm there after noting suspicious symptoms in one of the
animals.
Authorities throughout Europe have adopted a raft of measures to try to
keep the financially crippling disease at bay, effectively putting Britain
under quarantine. France's Agriculture Ministry said blood tests on British
sheep slaughtered at 9 farms in 5 French departments indicated they had
been in contact with the virus.
The ministry said 2 cattle in contact with some of the sheep at a farm in
the Cher department of central France had revealed "symptoms similar to
FMD." Both had been put down and the rest of the herd would be slaughtered.
Glavany last week ordered the preventive slaughter of 50 000 sheep: 20 000
from Britain and 30 000 that had come into contact with British livestock.
In Denmark, officials said they would know on Monday whether the disease
had crossed the North Sea to infect an animal there. Results of a second
test on a cow suspected of contracting FMD were due after an initial test
proved negative, the Danish Food and Agriculture Ministry said.
Irish soldiers manned checkpoints on the border with the British province
of Northern Ireland to try to prevent the spread of FMD into the Irish
Republic. The spreading crisis quickly hit export markets.
Bulgaria announced it had banned all imports of cloven-hoofed animals,
related products and fodder from France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands
and Ireland as a precaution. Japan said it had imposed a temporary ban on
imports of cloven-hoofed animals and related products from Belgium, France
and Denmark.
"It's a precautionary measure until we confirm the food safety there," an
Agriculture Ministry official said. In South Korea, officials added
possibly suspect meat from France, Germany and Denmark to a quarantine list
already set up for imports of cloven-hoofed animal products from Belgium.
That effectively suspended imports of cloven-hoofed animal products,
including pork, from those 3 countries until they are confirmed free of the
disease.
In Pakistan, veterinarians and cattle traders said thousands of animals
brought to Karachi to be sacrificed for the Muslim festival of Eid al-Adha
on Monday had shown signs of a disease similar to FMD. Neighboring
Iran-­where the virus is endemic­-discovered the disease in sheep in 3
centers east of the capital Tehran, state television reported.
The Mediterranean island of Cyprus began disinfecting the cease fire zone
separating the Greek and Turkish populations since 1974. Officials said it
was a precaution against possible infection from Turkey, where cases of FMD
were found in 2 regions of the southwest of the country. There was no
indication these were linked to the outbreak in Britain.
