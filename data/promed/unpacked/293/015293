University of Adelaide veterinary pathologists have confirmed that a marine virus not previously reported in South Australia has been identified in dead dolphins found washed up on the state's beaches.

Veterinary pathologist Dr Lucy Woolford, working within Roseworthy Campus' new Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, said they have identified dolphin morbillivirus and systemic fungal infection as the cause of the recent death of 2 juvenile dolphins.

Working with the Australian Marine Wildlife Research and Rescue Operation (AMWRRO), Dr Woolford has been investigating the deaths which have caused community concern. Over recent weeks 25 deceased juvenile dolphins have been found.

"This is the 1st report of dolphin morbillivirus (DMV) in South Australia," says Dr Woolford. "They have emerged as potent pathogens for marine mammals and this does raise some concern that more animals will be affected within South Australia in coming months. We don't know how big an impact it will have on the local dolphin population, whether it will be sporadic cases or become more widespread."

Dr Woolford conducted post-mortems on the dolphins with the help of AMWRRO and assistance from Biosecurity SA, and the pathology results have now been confirmed.

DMV has been previously implicated in the death of juvenile dolphins in Queensland, northern NSW, and Western Australia and, overseas, the virus has been thought to be the cause of die-offs of whales and dolphins.

The results of these findings have been provided to the recent task force set up by the State Government.

[Viruses in the _Morbillivirus_ genus, _Paramyxoviridae_ family, are enveloped, single stranded RNA viruses known to infect 3 mammalian orders: primates, carnivores, and Cetartiodactyla (previously separated as 2 orders, Cetacea and Artiodactyla). Special thanks to Cristina Casalone for sending this important piece of information about the episode.

Several dolphin die-offs have been attributed to dolphin morbillivirus (DMV) in the Mediterranean sea, since 1990. An acute form of the disease appears to occur during the die-offs, but following the outbreaks, unusual DMV infections affecting only the central nervous system were reported.

According to Guardo (Front Microbiol. 2012; 3: 431), several cases of chronic infection by DMV sharing striking features in common with human measles virus-related "subacute sclerosing panencephalitis" (SSP), as well as with canine distemper virus-related "old dog encephalitis" (ODE), have been recently described in Mediterranean dolphins. Indeed, these DMV-infected cetaceans showed immunohistochemical and/or biomolecular evidence of morbilliviral antigen and/or genome exclusively in their brain tissue, similarly to that reported in SSP-affected patients and ODE-affected dogs. - Mod.PMB
