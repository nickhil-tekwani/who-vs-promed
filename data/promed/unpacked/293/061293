Melioidosis, an infectious disease transmitted to the human body by contaminated soil and by inoculation, inhalation, and ingestion, has been detected in the coastal state of Odisha. Experts at the AIIMS in Bhubaneswar on Tue 29 Nov 2022, said more than 200 cases of melioidosis were found across the state where more than half of the cases were reported from the Khordha district. The disease has assumed an endemic proportion in neighboring countries like Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.

According to Prof Bijayini Behera from the Bhubaneswar AIIMS, melioidosis has baffled the medical community in having myriad manifestations presenting acutely with high fever, pneumonia, visceral abscesses culminating in life-threatening sepsis to indolent presentations of persistent low-grade fever, lymphadenitis and thus has earned a moniker of "great mimicker."

Patients with diabetes, hazardous level of alcohol consumption, and exposure to rice paddy fields run the highest risk of getting the disease. Urban people with minimum levels of soil exposure like gardening can also get the disease, said doctors. The disease is linked to environmental factors to afflict the human body through inhalation routes. The disease, without an accurate diagnosis and treatment, can be fatal in more than half of the cases, said the health experts.

[Melioidosis is a disease of the rainy season in its endemic areas. It mainly affects people who have direct contact with soil and water. Many have an underlying predisposing condition, such as diabetes (the commonest risk factor), renal disease, cirrhosis, thalassemia, alcohol dependence, immunosuppressive therapy, chronic obstructive lung disease, cystic fibrosis, and excess kava consumption (kava is an herbal member of the pepper family that can be associated with chronic liver disease).

Melioidosis may present at any age but peaks in the 4th and 5th decades of life, affecting men more than women. In addition, although severe fulminating infection can and does occur in healthy individuals, severe disease and fatalities are much less common in those without risk factors.

The most commonly recognized presentation of melioidosis is pneumonia, associated with high fever, significant muscle aches, and chest pain, and -- although the cough can be nonproductive -- respiratory secretions can be purulent, significant in quantity, and associated with on-and-off bright red blood. The lung infection can be rapidly fatal -- with bacteremia and shock -- or somewhat more indolent.

Acute melioidosis septicemia is the most severe complication of the infection. It presents as a typical sepsis syndrome with hypotension, high cardiac output, and low systemic vascular resistance. In many cases, a primary focus on the soft tissues or lungs can be found. The syndrome, usually in patients with risk factor comorbidities, is characteristically associated with multiple abscesses involving the cutaneous tissues, lung, liver, and spleen, and a very high mortality rate of 80%-95%. With prompt optimal therapy, the case fatality rate can be reduced to 40%-50%.

The melioidosis bacillus is intrinsically insensitive to many antimicrobials, and, in fact, bioterrorism strains may be engineered to be even more resistant. _B. pseudomallei_ is usually inhibited by tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT), antipseudomonal penicillins, carbapenems, ceftazidime, and amoxicillin/clavulanate or ampicillin/sulbactam. Ceftriaxone and cefotaxime have good in vitro activity but poor efficacy and cefepime did not appear, as well, to be equivalent to ceftazidime in a mouse model. The unusual antimicrobial profile of resistance to colistin and polymyxin B and the aminoglycosides but sensitivity to amoxicillin/clavulanate is a useful tool to consider in the treatment of infection with the organism.
