Fawns have wasting disease
4 animals in Nebraska youngest infected
---------------------------------------
The 4 fawns that tested positive for chronic wasting disease (CWD) in
Nebraska are the youngest animals found to carry the illness. Scientists
and wildlife officials call the development intriguing, though not
necessarily surprising. Few, if any, deer in that age range -- 6 to 8
months old -- have been killed and tested before, experts say. Hunters
submitting samples for chronic wasting testing rarely take fawns.
Still, the information is one more clue in a frightening disease vexing
agriculture and wildlife officials in Colorado, Wyoming, Nebraska and
elsewhere -- all of them desperate to keep it from spreading.
"Every time we pick up information on this disease, it gives us a little
more on how to solve it," said Bruce Morrison, assistant administrator for
the wildlife division of Nebraska's Game and Parks Commission.
The fawns -- originally reported by Nebraska officials as wild, but
actually part of a highly infected captive herd in the northern part of the
state's panhandle -- weren't showing outward signs of the disease.
The earliest stage a deer has shown physical symptoms of chronic wasting is
15 months. Those deer were part of an experimental herd given heavy doses
of the disease, said Mike Miller, a Colorado Division of Wildlife
veterinarian.
How the infected fawns in Nebraska contracted the disease isn't clear,
though experts don't believe the illness is passed on in the womb. They
believe close physical contact between an infected doe and her fawn after
birth is the more likely vehicle. CWD, which kills elk and deer, is similar
to mad cow disease in cattle, scrapie in sheep and "new variant"
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) in people. The illness causes tiny holes
in the brain. There are no verified cases of humans contracting chronic
wasting disease.
Until recently, the disease appeared confined to a small swath of Colorado
and Wyoming. But in recent years it has cropped up elsewhere, including on
private elk ranches. Wildlife and agricultural officials are scrambling to
contain and understand the illness, which has the potential to devastate
the hunting economy, tourism, and the elk ranching industry.
The infected fawns were discovered among a herd of captive elk and deer in
Sioux County in northwestern Nebraska.
