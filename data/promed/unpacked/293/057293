Japan: Man Believed to Have Contracted HIV via Transfusions
------------------------------------------------------------
A man who received blood transfusions earlier in 2003 at an eastern Japan
hospital has been infected with HIV, government and other sources said on
Wed 1 Oct 2003.
If donated blood were the source of the infection, it would be the 1st such
case in Japan since 1999, when the Japan Red Cross Society introduced a
highly sensitive virus detection method.

notwithstanding reports of recent problems in the control of blood products
