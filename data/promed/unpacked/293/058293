Two brothers have contracted the deadly bubonic plague after feasting on the meat of rodents. The men, from Mongolia, are said to have contracted the deadly disease from marmots, in a country where consuming the innards of the animals is traditionally believed to be good for your health. A 27-year-old and his brother, 17, are being treated in separate hospitals in Khovd province in western Mongolia. The older brother is in a "critical" condition.

The cases have now sparked urgent checks on 146 people with whom they were in contact. Health officials now face a big task ahead of them as it is believed 500 people may already be affected, say reports. Major security precautions have been put into operation amid fears of a spread.

The plague is spread by fleas living on wild rodents such as marmots, a large type of squirrel. The country's National Centre for Zoonotic Diseases confirmed that bubonic plague had been diagnosed, and emergency meetings have been set up.

It is a recurrent problem in the East Asian nation. A couple died of bubonic plague in the western Mongolian province of Bayan-Ulgii in April 2019 after eating raw marmot meat. It prompted authorities to warn against eating raw marmot because it can carry _Yersinia pestis_, the plague bacillus. The plague is spread by marmots coughing or through the bite of the tarbagan flea they carry, or through consumption of their meat.

Mongolia has quarantined its western region near the border with Russia after identifying 2 suspected cases of the black plague linked to the consumption of marmot meat, health officials said Wed 1 Jul 2020. Lab tests confirmed that 2 unidentified individuals had contracted the "marmot plague" in the region of Khovd, Mongolia's National Center for Zoonotic Disease (NCZD) said in a statement.

The NCZD said it moved to quarantine the provincial capital and one of the region's districts about 500 km [311 mi] south of the southern Siberian republics of Tyva and Altai. Vehicles are temporarily banned from entering the region, the state-run TASS news agency cited Mongolian media as saying.

The NCZD said it has analyzed samples taken from 146 people who it said had contacts with the 2 infected persons and identified 504 2nd-contact individuals. Media reports suggested that the victims were a 27-year-old male and a young woman of an unknown age.

Mongolia closed a key border crossing with Russia in May 2019 on suspicion that it may have played a role in an outbreak of the plague, stranding several Russian tourists. A husband and wife had died after eating marmot meat in that incident. Experts say the direct descendants of the same bubonic plague that killed 50 million people in the 14th century still exist today, killing around 2000 people a year.

[One report states that a 2nd case was the brother of the primary case, but the other report states that it was a woman.

Plague is caused by _Yersinia pestis_.

Most cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea, causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a "bubo." Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being bitten.

When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antimicrobial therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. At this stage, person-to-person spread can occur, causing other cases of "primary" plague pneumonia. A quarantine would be required with contact tracing and even prophylactic antimicrobials if the index case or cases actually had plague pneumonia.

Plague is endemic in Mongolia. Marmots such as the Tarvaga, the Tarbagan or Mongolian marmot, _Marmota sibirica_, a large rodent related to the American woodchuck (_Marmota monax_), are thought to be significant zoonotic reservoirs for _Y. pestis_ in Eastern Asia. The name marmot (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmot) comes from French marmotte, from Latin _mures monti_ "mountain mouse."

While foodborne transmission of _Y. pestis_ has been described (e.g., Leslie T, et al. Outbreak of gastroenteritis caused by _Yersinia pestis_ in Afghanistan. Epidemiol Infect. 2011; 139(5): 728-35; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20663260), it is far more likely that the bubonic plague cases were acquired via the bites of infected fleas. - Mod.LL
