[According to a report in the media published on 16 Oct 2022, "The country's chief veterinary officer, Albertina Shilongo, said the areas of Kabbe South and North constituencies have been declared FMD-infected areas, while the entire Zambezi region is declared a disease management area (DMA).

"Intensive FMD surveillance aimed at establishing the extent of the outbreak is underway, Shilongo said, adding that movement of all cloven-hoofed animals out and through the controlled area has been banned, with immediate effect.

"She said all previously issued permits into and out of the controlled area are canceled and recalled except animals originating from other FMD zones destined to export abattoir.

"The government has also banned the transportation of potentially infectious commodities out and through controlled areas such as hides, skins, game trophies, grass, and plant materials.

"She said vaccination of cattle against FMD will commence next week."

FMD is not readily transmissible to humans and is not a public health risk.

Please note that any discrepancies in event start, confirmation, and other dates in ProMED posts and the WOAH corresponding reports are the result of a technical problem already being addressed by WOAH. - Mod.CRD
