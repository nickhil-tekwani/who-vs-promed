Subject: Anthrax in Mursiland [Edited]

Anthrax in Mursiland
---------------------------
Denis Hoffmann, FAO, recommended that an apparently unusual manifestation
of anthrax in Mursiland be brought to your attention.
On Monday [18th Nov 2002] Barbara sent an email from Addis Ababa about 5
Mursi dying from anthrax and numbers [of other cases] with clinical signs
[of anthrax]. The Mursi are a semi-nomadic cattle herding tribe in southern
Ethiopia in the Omo River region. It is surprising that the Mursi were
unable to identify anthrax in their animals.
David Turton, an anthropologist, has lived with and published much about
this tribe. One of his publications details their approach to the health of
their cattle and it is obvious that they have extremely astute powers of
observation and closely correlate clinical signs with macroscopic
postmortem findings and disease epidemiology.
This is the extract of the relevant part of Barbara's email:
"I talked to Jonathan [a veterinarian] on the radio tonight. ... He told me
more about ... the anthrax outbreak down south in Mursiland. Five people
have died -- four from eating infected meat and one [of two] from drinking
blood from an infected beast; the meat-eaters died within 3-4 days; one
blood-drinker died within a day but the other survived but swelled up.
There are many others sick and lesions on those who were cutting up meat
and one from a fly bite. He is a bit concerned because the symptoms do not
sound normal for anthrax and asked me to ask you to do an internet search
for him. He wants to know about gastrointestinal anthrax in humans - rare
because [the Mursi] people don't usually eat infected cattle. [See above
for their ability to recognize anthrax in their livestock.]
Subsequently some lesser kudu and dikdik were noticed dead and those who
handled those carcasses now have lesions.
?The symptom that sounds different from the textbooks is that cattle which
are now sick have generalized swelling over the entire body and so do other
people who also ate meat. The swelling is so extreme that their fingers are
pushed apart and they cannot see out of their eyes. [This] generalized
swelling [is] unusual [for anthrax].

[This doesn't sound like anthrax because of the general body swelling,
unless the Mursi are seeing something the rest of us have missed.
The communication refers to "lesions" but without clarification. With
anthrax the common lesions are cutaneous, usually on the hands & forearms,
inflamed with small vesicles around the central wound area, which later
develops into a flat ulcer with a raised edge and turns black. The
pathognomonic characteristic is lack of pain though there will be fever.
One does get regional edema with _B. anthracis_ so that a hand or arm can
swell up, but I have never heard of generalized edema. A facial anthrax
lesion can spread the edema across the face and lead to closed eyes.
Cutaneous anthrax is commonly seen in folks butchering infected animals.
Horses traditionally get a dependent edema with their cutaneous infections
-- with a tide-mark where the edema starts -- and this has also been noted
in cattle. Generalized edema is not usually obvious with sick livestock
until one opens up the carcass and finds bloody fluid in the major cavities.
With gastrointestinal anthrax the victim passes bloody feces, develops
peritonitis, ascites, and dies; but for each obvious clinical case there
will be 5-10 with mild symptoms. The vegetative cells in infected blood are
very fragile and won't survive gastric juices. Thus, any drinking of
"infected" bovine blood should demand an entry site in the throat or
esophagus. Maybe this depends on the volume of blood ingested.
Gastrointestinal anthrax is, unfortunately, not uncommon these days in
Africa and Central Asia, but a generalized obvious body reaction is not
something that springs straight to mind. Chronic infections I have heard of
but not with disease ... it was a Brazilian cow chronically secreting in
its milk, very odd.
Rift Valley Fever is a possibility, but this is not usually lethal for
humans unless they are malnourished, have malaria, etc, as happened some
years ago in Somalia, Kenya and adjoining parts of the Ogaden. That was
associated with heavy rainfalls and large mosquito hatches.
Logically the central veterinary laboratory in Addis Ababa should be able
to work up any blood smears or swabs brought in to check for _B. anthracis._
