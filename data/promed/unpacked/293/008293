LUPIN SEED TOXICITY - AUSTRALIA: ALERT

Health bean has one problem: it kills, say authorities
------------------------------------------------------
A bean that is finding popularity because of its low GI properties
can be deadly if not prepared in the correct way, authorities have
warned. Lupins, which come in bitter and sweet varieties, are being
added to products like bread to lower its rating on the glycemic
index and in sausages to reduce fat. They can also be eaten raw as a
snack, but doctors say they must be treated 1st to remove dangerous
levels of a toxic alkaloid.

The warning comes after 2 women were taken to a Western Australia
(WA) hospital after being inadvertently poisoned by the beans. They
suffered blurred vision, light-headedness, lethargy and had
difficultly walking.

"Fortunately, neither of the 2 women who presented to hospital became
seriously ill," says Nevada Pingault, an epidemiologist at WA
Health's Communicable Disease Control Directorate. "But lupin
poisoning can be fatal."

An investigation revealed a quantity of bitter lupins had been milled
into flour to meet a local shortage in supply. It was onsold to
stores, but it contained 1000 times the alkaloid level permitted for flour.

Ms Pingault said there was an "increasing consumption of lupin
products" across the community, but consumers and food makers may not
be aware of the risks. "We recommend that information be provided ...
about the dangers of selling and eating products containing bitter
lupins that have not been appropriately treated to remove toxic
alkaloids," she says.

The warning is published in the Medical Journal of Australia.

[Lupins contain quinolizidine alkaloids, but some piperidine
alkaloids and other types of alkaloids have also been isolated from
various species of _Lupinus_. These alkaloids are usually nicotinic
in effect. The nitrogen oxides of some of these bases have also been
detected in some lupins. The alkaloids are present in the foliage but
the greatest concentration is in the seeds.

These women experienced an anticholinergic syndrome, meaning that
acetylcholine was blocked by one of the toxic principles in the lupin seed.

In Australia, there are 2 types of lupin seeds, the sweet and the
bitter. The sweet form has been used as a food source for some time.
If the bitter form is to be used the seeds must be soaked with
frequent water changes for a long period of time in order to remove
the toxins from the seeds. - Mod.TG]

[While the actual event occurred in 2007, there is concern of growing
use of lupin seed and lupin seed products in Australia, by a public
that is not aware of the potential toxicity of different types of seeds.
