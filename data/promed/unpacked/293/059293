HEALTH ALERT IN NUEVO LEON FOR DENGUE OUTBREAK
Health authorities in the Mexican state of Nuevo Leon, on the border with
the United States, on Tuesday placed the area on alert, due to dengue
outbreaks detected in the region, official sources announced.
According to Nuevo Leon Health Secretary Jesus Zacarias, there have been
dengue outbreaks mainly in the municipality of Linares in the southern part
of the state, and in the metropolitan area of Monterrey, its capital, where
150 cases of dengue fever, double the number of cases recorded last year,
have been reported so far in 1999.
Heavy rainfall favors the growth of larvae of the mosquito responsible for
transmitting the disease, Zacarias told the local media.
Health authorities have started spraying to "clean" more than 200,000 homes
in the areas where outbreaks have been documented.
Dengue fever, which is transmitted by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, causes
symptoms similar to those of the flu, with high temperature and vomiting,
but it does not endanger human life unless it turns into hemorrhagic dengue
[which affects a small percentage of people who have had a previous
infection with another strain of the 4 types of dengue - Mod.JW

[Brownsville, McAllen and Laredo are three cities in Texas that border on
Nueva Leon in Mexico. In prior years, cases of dengue have occurred in
Texas residents. Most have been imported cases from Mexico, but
periodically there has been indigenous transmission of dengue in Texas
residents without a history of travel to a known dengue endemic area. Given
the increase in cases reported in Nueva Leon, there is always the
possibility of cases occurring in neighboring Texas. - MPP
