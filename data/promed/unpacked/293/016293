The Limpopo Department of Health is alerting people, particularly those who regularly work or handle livestock and animals, to be cautious following confirmation of a case of brucellosis in the Giyani area, where a livestock farmer died after having been diagnosed with the disease.

Brucellosis is an infectious disease caused by a type of bacteria called _Brucella_. The bacterium can spread from animals to humans. The infection is acquired through ingestion or direct contact such as touching, splashes onto mucous membranes, and inhalation (breathing in) of contaminated animal products. The infection with _Brucella_ species is not spread from person to person.

Spokesperson for the department, Neil Shikwambana, says the farmer contracted the disease after he was reported to have drank unpasteurized (unboiled) milk from his cattle.

Brucellosis can be contracted through eating undercooked/uncooked meat or consuming unpasteurized/raw dairy products (milk, cheese, ice cream), or coming into contact with an infected animal. Bacteria can also enter wounds in the skin/mucous membranes through contact with infected animals. This includes people who have close contact with animals or animal excretions (newborn animals, fetuses, and excretions that may result from birth) such as slaughterhouse workers, meat-packing plant employees, veterinarians, farmers and hunters (inhaling the bacteria while dressing their game).

People most at risk include infants and young children, older adults, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems, such as people with cancer, an organ transplant, or HIV.
