Anthrax keeps killing
-----------------------
More animals have succumbed to the anthrax outbreak around Melfort,
including farmed bison and farmed white-tail deer, as farmers and the
Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) try to keep the toxin [sic]
contained. "We have 27 quarantined premises in the Melfort area, and we've
had 106 suspected or questionable deaths," said Dr. Greg Douglas, a
veterinarian with the CFIA. Five deaths of anthrax have been confirmed so
far, and many more results are pending, Douglas said. He said most of the
dead animals are cattle, but there have been positive anthrax test results
for bison and white-tail deer carcasses too.
A crew of about 25 people, including veterinarians, inspectors and support
staff, is dealing with the outbreak. Local veterinarians from Melfort are
also helping farmers vaccinate their herds. "As of today [8 Jul 2006], we
have dispensed 5000 doses of vaccine," said Ross Hawkes, a summer student
at a veterinary clinic in Melfort. "We are also in charge of distributing
the vaccines to necessary areas. It's in such short supply," he added.
Hawkes said most animals in the affected areas are being vaccinated,
including cattle, horses, goats and sheep. He said the CFIA bought an
emergency supply of vaccinations from the United States. [Presumably from
the Colorado Serum Company. - Mod.MHJ]
There have been anthrax outbreaks in Saskatchewan before, Douglas said, but
nothing quite like this. Anthrax spores can survive in soil for 50 to 250
years, he explained.

Melfort livestock death toll rises
-------------------------------------
Animals are continuing to die in more and more areas near Melfort, while
farmers try desperately to stave off an anthrax outbreak by vaccinating
their animals.
But even after vaccinating all the sheep and cattle on his farm, Lloyd
Haugerud is still losing animals. Another one of his cows died on Saturday
[8 Jul 2006] night, bringing the total of dead animals on his farm up to 9.
Outside his window, he can see the dead animals' carcasses burning.
People working with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency have been visiting
Haugerud's farm to keep track of the cattle deaths. They have given
Haugerud hints that the government may compensate him for his lost cattle.
"They just said, 'Keep track of what it's costing you,'" said Haugerud. At
this point, he estimates the labor, vaccinations, lost cows and other
expenses of this incident have cost him at least CAD 10 000 [USD 8900]. He
said he planned to vaccinate his cattle for a 2nd time on Sunday [9 Jul
2006] "to stop them from dying." But he found out vaccine supplies have run
out, meaning he will have to wait until Wednesday to give his cattle a
booster shot.
As of Friday [7 Jul 2006], there were 27 quarantined premises in the
Melfort area and 106 suspicious deaths. Five deaths from anthrax had been
confirmed at that time. Dr. Eldon Pederson, a veterinarian in the area,
said he couldn't give an official update of those numbers but said the
outbreak has not been contained. "We are still continuing to get some new
cases," he said Sunday.
Ken Tegstrom didn't start losing animals until after he had vaccinated his
200-strong herd. But 5 days after vaccinating his herd, he's lost 3 bulls,
and his farm has been quarantined. Tegstrom said the disease seems to have
started popping up outside of the 1st heavily affected area. On Saturday [8
Jul 2006], his farm was the furthest west to have been hit with animal
deaths, but by Sunday, another farm to the west of him had lost an animal.
"They're still dying fairly regularly," he said. Like Haugerud, Tegstrom is
counting the days until the vaccine has its full effect.
Both men have been told that cattle will have stronger immunity 4 to 12
days after being vaccinated.
"I'm on day 5," said Tegstrom. "By day 12, you should be pretty safe."

[Deaths from animals incubating disease at the time of vaccination will
occur up to 8 days following vaccination. By about day 9, there is usually
adequate acquired immunity to stave off infections. And the above
experiences are why it is strongly advised that ranchers/farmers 1st treat
their stock with a long-acting antibiotic, wait 7-10 days, and then
vaccinate. Spores can survive in soil for some 50-60 years but 250 years is
a bit of a stretch. The latter is based on an anecdotal report of a South
African colleague, but his spore isolation from those old bones has not
been confirmed by others. And frankly, if 100 year survivals were common,
we would never see the end of this disease, while the reality is that it is
getting less and less common, and significant areas of the world are now
essentially free of this disease thanks to proper control. The flip side is
that as outbreaks become infrequent, ranchers stop vaccinating, and if an
outbreak occurs, the neighboring cattle are susceptible. - Mod.MHJ]
