Trinidad, Colorado: News - Anthrax cow to remain in Raton landfill
The carcass of a cow that died of anthrax should not have been buried in
the Raton landfill, according to New Mexico Environment Department
officials. Those state officials, though, did acknowledge that the
veterinarian who brought the dead cow to the landfill and city workers who
accepted and buried the carcass were unaware at the time that they were
dealing with anthrax. Still, the Environment Department last week issued a
Notice of Violation to the City of Raton for placing the infected cow in
the city landfill in mid-August.
Chuck Hules, the supervisor for the Environment Department's Compliance
Monitoring and Enforcement Section, said the Notice of Violation issued to
the city contains no actual penalties, but requires the city to ensure that
landfill workers know the right questions to ask when a dead animal is
brought to the landfill. Hules said his department has instructed the local
workers on that matter since the anthrax cow was buried. City Sanitation
Director Butt said his employees are now asking the necessary questions,
something they had not been doing prior to the anthrax incident. "It had
never been a problem before," Butt said.
Hules and Ernie Gutierrez, a solid waste inspector for the department, met
with the local veterinarian who examined the anthrax cow and city landfill
officials in Raton recently to discuss and review the situation.
Hules said he believes there is "no chance" of any anthrax spores reaching
the groundwater below the landfill. Hules said groundwater in some parts of
the Raton landfill is as close as 31 feet to 40 feet below the bottom of
refuse pits, but that most of the landfill is separated by 70 feet to 100
feet from groundwater. Those distances are less than the current state
regulations that require at least 100 feet between groundwater and the
bottom of a landfill pit. However, the Raton landfill was opened in 1983,
prior to the current regulations being enacted, and so the landfill is
exempt from those distance standards, Hules said.
Despite the less-than-standard distances from groundwater, Hules said risk
of groundwater contamination at the Raton landfill is considerably reduced
by a natural layer of clay soils under the landfill. The clay provides a
fairly impermeable layer between trash and groundwater, according to Hules.
In addition, the diseased cow was buried in an area that sits on top of a
closed trash pit, providing an extra 20-foot to 30-foot buffer between the
cow and groundwater, according to Larry Butt, the director of the City of
Raton's sanitation department, which operates the landfill east of the city.
Butt admits, though, having the anthrax cow in the landfill makes him a
little nervous. "It's not what I'd call the most comfortable feeling," he
said. Plans call for the cow to remain in the landfill.
Florence Higgins, the Environment Department supervisor for the Raton area,
explained that trying to move the cow would likely release spores into the
air, creating the potential for people to become infected by inhaling them.
"Once we know where it is, it's better to leave it there," Higgins said.
She said, however, that she understands Raton residents' uneasiness. She
said her office has received some "complaints and concerns" from local
residents about the anthrax cow being in the landfill. "Anthrax is scary,"
Higgins said. "It scares people because it's strange and unusual."
Dr. David Keller, director of the state Department of Health's Infectious
Disease Epidemiology Program, stressed the importance of properly
destroying infected animal carcasses. Hules, of the Environment Department,
said the diseased cow should have been taken to one of several infectious
waste disposal sites in the state to be incinerated. But Raton officials
did not get test results back from the state - determining that anthrax was
present - until after the cow was buried.
Discussing the anthrax cow, Higgins said "everything occurred at the wrong
time" because Raton veterinarian Mark Jansen was very busy during the week
of the county fair when the cow died on a Wagon Mound ranch. Normally,
Higgins said, a dead cow's necropsy would be performed on the ranch and the
animal would be buried on the ranch. In this case, though, the rancher
apparently "panicked," Higgins said, and brought the dead cow to Jansen's
office in Raton, where the necropsy was performed. Higgins said Jansen
followed standard procedure in wanting to dispose of the carcass quickly
after examination to minimize the risk of any type of bacteria spreading,
not to mention avoiding the strong smell emitted from a dead animal that
has been examined.
Higgins said no more anthrax cases have occurred on the Wagon Mound ranch
where the anthrax cow was found dead Aug. 14.
Butt said the sanitation department plans to build up about 15 feet of dirt
on top of the cow carcass. That will not happen, though, until the
department's front-end loader is rebuilt into working order. Butt expects
that to be done in about a month. Currently, there is a four-foot to
six-foot layer of dirt on top of the cow, he said. City officials said
1,500 pounds of quicklime were placed on top of the spot where the cow was
buried to increase the acidity of the soil in an attempt to kill anthrax
spores. Sanitation workers have filled in holes and other low spots around
the burial area with material they hope will absorb rainwater and other
moisture so that standing water will not build up or soak into the dirt in
the area and provide a means for the spread of the spores.
Butt said he intends to place a "bio-hazard" marker on the cow burial area,
which has been mapped and closed off from the areas around it. Butt also
wants city officials to indicate the location of the cow with a special
note in the landfill property deed. "A hundred years down the road, who
knows," he said. "That's why we need that marker, so future generations
will know there's a problem there."

[There are a number of lessons to be learnt from this, starting with the
NMVMA running a refresher course on the gross lesions associated with
livestock anthrax and the proper disposal of affected carcasses. The latter
should always be by incineration, preferably on site, and not burial with
or without quicklime ... the function of the latter has always escaped me
but I presume it involves a chemical 'incineration' as well as folk
memories of burying executed murderers in prison yards. Placing 1,500 lbs.
15 feet above the buried carcass, vide supra, can only increase the amount
of calcium in the soil and increase the pH, both factors associated with
extended spore persistence. In our experience, spores have a slight
positive buoyancy in nature and therefore tend to float upwards when the
soil is wet, especially when the water is full of minerals. Having
signposted the site, I do hope that the authorities will take note of any
future unlicensed excavations, potentially by folk wishing to acquire
private cultures.
Lastly, a serious problem is highlighted by this incident ... the delay
between taking samples and obtaining laboratory confirmation. Depending on
a necropsy significantly increases the potential environmental
contamination, if incineration and site control is not initiated quickly.
Fixing, staining, and reading blood smears carcass-side is not something
that most vets are capable of these days, if only because it is a rare vet
with a microscope and capsular stain in his/her pickup. We need a reliable
field-diagnostic kit, such as an ELISA dipstick test. - Mod.MHJ
