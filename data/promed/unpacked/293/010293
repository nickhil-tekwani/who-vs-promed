3 new cases of H7N9 avian influenza infection in Shanghai
---------------------------------------------------------
The reporter learned from the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission at 21:00 on Thu 4 Apr 2013 that 3 more cases of H7N9 avian influenza infection were reported in Shanghai. To date, total 6 cases including 4 deaths have been reported in the city. One of the cases is a 4-year-old child who is recovering now.

On Wed 3 Apr 2013, 2 patients admitted in Tongji Hospital and Huashan Hospital died even after emergency treatments. Two of them were confirmed to have H7N9 avian influenza infection on Thu 4 Apr 2013.

Another reporter also learned from Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission that the National Avian Influenza Reference Laboratory has identified H7N9 avian influenza virus in specimens from a dove [pigeon] at the Shanghai Huai agricultural products wholesale market in Songjiang District. The genetic sequence analysis showed that the strains of low pathogenic avian influenza virus isolates were highly homologous with the H7N9 avian flu virus. The Shanghai Agriculture Commission is taking appropriate prevention and control measures rapidly as per guidance from the Ministry of Agriculture.

5th death from H7N9 avian flu reported in China
-----------------------------------------------
11 people in China have contracted the H7N9 virus, 4 have died from it. A new strain of bird flu has claimed 2 more lives in China's business capital of Shanghai, taking the total number of human deaths attributed to the H7N9 virus to 5, state media said on Thursday. 4 of the deaths have occurred in the commercial hub, while the other was reported in the neighbouring province of Zhejiang on Wednesday. Chinese authorities are trying to determine how exactly the new variety of bird flu infects people, but say there is no evidence yet of human-to-human transmission.

The total number of confirmed cases now stands at 14, including 6 from Shanghai, according to the official Xinhua news agency which cited health authorities. Shanghai Health Bureau said on Thursday a 48-year-old Jiangsu man, who worked in the chicken and duck transportation business, died on Wednesday morning [4 Apr 2013]after contracting the virus.

A 64-year-old farmer from Wuxing district in Huzhou city who was hospitalised on Sunday [31 Mar 2013] tested positive for the virus on Wednesday night [4 Apr 2013] by the Zhejiang Disease Control and Prevention Centre , Xinhua news agency reported on Thursday.

No abnormal conditions were found in the 55 people the man had been in close contact with, the report said.

Also on Thursday [4 Apr 2013], an expert team of Hong Kong health officials set off on a trip to Shanghai to gather and exchange information on the new flu strain. The 6-member Hong Kong team sent to Shanghai is led by the Hong Kong Hospital Authority's head of infection, emergency and contingency planning, Dr Liu Shao-haei, and consists of officials from the authority, the Centre for Health Protection, and Yuen Kwok-yung, chair professor of the University of Hong Kong's Department of Microbiology. The team will meet with Shanghai experts over 2 days to exchange treatment and clinical reviews regarding H7N9 influenza infection.

The World Health Organisation on Wednesday ruled out the possibility of a pandemic because the sub-type is not thought to be transmitted from human to human, unlike the more common H5N1 strain. But health experts have emphasised the need to quickly identify the source of the virus and its mode of transmission to reduce human exposure. China's Ministry of Agriculture said on Thursday the virus has been detected in pigeon samples collected at a marketplace in Shanghai, according to a Xinhua report, which did not define the nature of the samples.

After gene sequence analysis, the national avian flu reference laboratory found the strain of the virus in pigeons to be "highly congenetic with those found on persons infected with H7N9 virus".
