Concerning the possibility of transmission to human beings, has anyone
suggested looking at people who are at high risk (assuming that there is a
risk)? Specifically, taxidermists in the mountain west of the U.S.A. may
be at high risk. Farmers and ranchers whose land is frequented by elk and
deer may be at higher risk because [of elk and deer poaching. For
instance, farmers and ranchers who live along the western slope of the
Wasatch Mountains in Utah had a higher radioactive cesium load during the
age of nuclear testing because they were at the end of a food chain (just
above elk and deer) that concentrated cesium from nuclear fallout.
