A very ill Austrian citizen has been admitted to the Intensive Care
Unit of Ceuta Hospital, Morocco, after having been infected with the
rabies virus while he was in the country.
According to information received this afternoon [3 Sep 2004] from
the Ministry of Health via the epidemiological surveillance services
of the Autonomous City, approximately 40 days ago, a young Austrian
couple (23 and 24 years old) arrived in Morocco from Austria,
bringing their dog with them. A few days later, the animal developed
strange behavior and attacked its owner.
Shortly afterwards, the dog died, and it was buried near Agadir. On 1
Sep 2004, the young man was admitted to Ceuta Hospital with a
clinical condition that led health care workers to suspect that this
was a possible case of rabies. In spite of receiving anti-rabies
immunization, his health condition has worsened.

[The incubation period for rabies can be as short as 10 days in both humans
and dogs, allowing time for both illnesses to occur within the 40-day period
the victim was in Morocco. However, the dog could have been infected earlier
and brought to Morocco, rather than being infected there. One wonders if
the Austrian couple travelled overland, taking time in southern France en
route. If they did, they would have entered France after the end of the at-
risk period from the rabid dog that entered France from Morocco in May 2004,
and before that of the one that made the same journey in August; France has
been free of indigenous rabies since 1998 -- see refs. below.

It is not a good idea to take an unvaccinated dog to -- or to adopt any dog
in -- any rabies-endemic country. It is never a good idea to leave your dog
unvaccinated -- this should be done between the ages of 3 months & 1 year. -

[Several points arise:
1.The clinical suspicion of rabies should first be confirmed; this is
nowadays feasible in vivo.
2. Is it certain that "their dog" was indeed brought from Austria?
3. Had it been vaccinated?
4. Contacts of the human patient with other infected dogs cannot be excluded,
and it even could have been the same source that infected both dog and owner.
Obviously, when having a dog, one's chances for contacts with other dogs are
increased. Morocco is heavily infected with urban rabies. Officially reported
rabies cases in Morocco were:
2002: 23 humans, 192 dogs, 25 cats.
2003: 17 humans, 173 dogs, 14 cats.
Obviously, the actual incidence in animals was much higher. In addition,
there were numerous cases in domestic farm animals etc.
5. It is most unlikely that the dog got infected in Austria. Austria reported
one single rabies case -- in an equine -- during 2003; oral vaccination in
wildlife is applied. Â– Mod. ARN]
