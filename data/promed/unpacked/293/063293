As previously reported by "IA riag.ru", one of the sheep farms in the
Odintsovo district of the Moscow region was found infected with a dangerous
disease agent, brucellosis. "The case is not exceptional and the situation
is under control; no room for hysteria and panic," said the Odintsovo
District's chief veterinary officer, Vladimir Motoshin, in an interview.

As explained by Motoshin, in December 2007, a farmer introduced 100 sheep
from the Volgograd region without the prescribed permits and in violation
of all veterinary rules.

On 29 Feb 2008, the Odintsovo veterinary office was informed on the strange
behavior [see commentary] of animals on the Kozlov farm. The Head district
veterinarian visited the site on the same day and issued an official order
to put the farm and the village Solmanovo under quarantine.

A police post was established on the location. Out of 82 tested animals, 25
were found brucellosis positive. Prior to the established diagnosis, 18
sheep were gone. The owner said that they had been consumed by the family,
stating that they were not sold in Moscow.

Currently, the Kozlov family members and all neighbors are being examined.
The Prosecutor's office has been informed about the case, since the farmer
had managed to transport animals across nearly half of Russia without
proper documentations. passing through tens of police posts. As the farmer
explains, he successfully offered bribes in every road post.

After the final analysis, the unaffected sheep will be sent to an abattoir
and slaughtered for meat, while the infected sheep sent to a rendering plant.

Vladimir Mitoshin underlined once more that there is no danger to animals
or humans as of today.

[It may be assumed that the sheep, originating in the Volgograd region
(about 1000 km south of Moscow; map at
<http://www.geographicguide.net/europe/maps-europe/maps/russia-map.jpg>)
were found (or suspected?) to be infected by _Brucella melitensis_, a
zoonotic bacterium known to be endemic in the southern parts of Russia. The
event illustrates the complexity of controlling animal diseases in the huge
Russian territory.

The reported "strange behavior" of the sheep on the farm needs
clarification. The only clinical manifestation of brucellosis in sheep is
abortion; could this be the meaning of "strange behavior"?! The control of
_B. melitensis_ can be carried out, on top of quarantine measures, by the
"test and slaughter" policy, or by preventive vaccination, which should be
combined with animal identification. For the procedures and biologicals
applied, refer to chapter CHAPTER 2.4.2. in OIE's Manual of Diagnostic
Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals, available at
