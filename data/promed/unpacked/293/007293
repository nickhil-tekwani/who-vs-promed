Fishing communities and non-governmental organisations around Lake Victoria
want to take charge of the basin's resources, new research says.
Stakeholders in the Lake Victoria fisheries are dissatisfied with the
government's handling of the sub-sector and are lobbying to have
community-based organisations take over its management. The report,
prepared by a local NGO, Osienala, accuses the government of frustrating
locals' efforts in managing the lake's resources. Mr John Owino, a project
officer with Osienala, says Lake Victoria faces a management crisis which
could seriously affect employment and food security.
The report says poor implementation of government regulations and policies
on fishing have led to destructive fishing methods and exploitation of
fishermen. The rules and regulations as well as the fishing industry
development plans are only documented on paper but they are hardly
implemented at the local level, Mr Owino says. The traditional management
of Lake Victoria based on clan institutions, he says, ensured sound
management of the fisheries. The traditional management framework was based
on the territorial user rights, with clear enforceable rules and
regulations on who should fish where, when and how. This system, he argues,
resulted in rich fisheries that were more diverse in terms stock.
In the report, entitled "Community participation and the role of the
government in the management of Lake Victoria Fisheries", the researcher
says the government should provide an enabling environment for the
community to participate in the administration of the lake's resources. The
government should not undermine institutions which promote community
participation in Lake Victoria fisheries management but instead strengthen
their capacity through proper regulations.
The report also says the Fisheries Act adopted in 1989 and revised in 1991
has never been effectively implemented. Mr Owino suggests that the Act has
failed to help eliminate trawling in the lake. Trawling, a destructive
fishing method, has persisted in the lake for the past five years despite
demands for a ban by fishermen and environmentalists. The government has in
the past issued banning orders to little avail. The research condemns the
licensing of fishing boats as flawed, saying officials have turned it into
a fund raiser.
As a result of the loopholes in the Act, fishermen's cooperative societies
have collapsed and they have to contend with middlemen who reap huge
profits at their expense. It is claimed that many fishermen have become so
disillusioned with the cooperatives that they prefer selling their fish
directly to agents. The researcher recommends that the self help groups the
fishermen have formed should be supported by the government as they
provided an opportunity to conserve the lake and utilise its resources.
Mr Owino's report comes in the wake of the formation of a regional
stakeholders body to manage Lake Victoria's resources. Researchers and
economists have recently noted that the East African fishing communities
are continuing to slide into poverty despite abundant fisheries resources.
In a report from Local to Global Markets, Dr Eirik Jensen of the World
Conservation Union (IUCN) and Mr Richard Abila of the Kenya Marine and
Fisheries Research Institute paint a grim picture of the local fisherfolk.
They say the great transformation that has taken place in the Lake Victoria
fisheries have left local fishermen poorer than they were many years back,
as multinational firms penetrate the industry. The booming fish exports
have seriously compromised food security in the lake region. More than 90
per cent of fish caught in the lake are either exported as fillets or
processed into fishmeal for the agricultural industry.
The researchers recommend that the fisheries policy be re-focused to lay
greater emphasis on food security and address conflicting objectives. These
objectives are the goal to maximise foreign exchange earnings while
ensuring food security.
