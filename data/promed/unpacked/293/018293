A domestic cat in rural northwest Weld County has tested positive for plague.
The cat became sick in early June [2017] and is receiving treatment, according to a Wednesday news release from the Weld County Department of Public Health and Environment. The cat is expected to make a full recovery, and the owner is taking preventive antibiotics. Weld County has taken the lead on the case, but the home is near the Larimer-Weld county line.

The Larimer County Department of Health and Environment has one key message for residents: Don't panic. Larimer and Weld counties have instances of plague in rodents nearly every year, especially in more rural areas. Prairie dogs test positive for plague fairly regularly, and family pets occasionally contract the disease. Larimer County health department spokeswoman Katie O'Donnell said 3 cats and a dog have been infected in Larimer County in the past 2 years.

Plague is treatable, both in people and animals, as long as it's caught early, O'Donnell said.

The most common strain in the area is bubonic plague, which is not contagious person to person but is carried by infected fleas and rodents. People most commonly contract plague from the bite of an infected flea, but they can also get the disease from direct contact with an infected animal. O'Donnell said the department sees the bulk of its cases between spring and the 1st freeze in the fall.

Symptoms include a sudden onset of fever, headache, chills, weakness, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, as well as swollen and painful lymph nodes near the flea bite.

People can help prevent infection by applying insect repellent on themselves and flea-prevention treatments on their animals, O'Donnell said.

In 2015, TG, a 16-year-old Poudre High School student, died after he contracted septicemic plague, a rare and highly fatal strain. He was Larimer County's 1st confirmed plague death since 1999.

Plague is largely concentrated in the western United States, and an average of 7 people contract the disease nationwide each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control.

Prevent plague and other animal-borne diseases [Source: Weld County Department of Public Health and Environment]
- Avoid flea bites: Stay away from rodents, and consider wearing repellent when in areas where rodents are present.
- Keep fleas off your pets by applying flea-control products.
- Do not allow cats or dogs that roam and hunt to sleep in your bed, as they can carry fleas.
- Reduce rodent habitat around your home. Remove brush, trim vegetation and keep the area clear.
- Do not feed or handle wildlife. If you must dispose of a carcass, wear gloves or use a shovel.

[Domestic cats present a risk because they can bring infected fleas into the house. Also you don't want an infected pet cat nuzzling and breathing into your mouth. But _Yersnia pestis_ responds well to antibiotics if taken early, and preferably prophylacticly if exposure is suspected. If you can it is worth watching and listening to the video clip in this report. - Mod.MHJ
