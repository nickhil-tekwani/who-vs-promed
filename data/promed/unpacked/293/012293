Only 8% of more than 25 000 German COVID-19 patients had high viral loads, 1/3 of whom were presymptomatic, asymptomatic, or mildly symptomatic, according to a study published yesterday [Tue 25 May 2021] in Science. High viral loads suggest greater infectiousness.

Led by researchers from the Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, the study involved measuring SARS-CoV-2 viral loads and estimating probability of virus cell culture isolation in 25 381 coronavirus patients, 24% of whom were identified at testing facilities, 38% of whom were hospitalized, and 6% of whom were infected with the B117 variant first seen in the United Kingdom.

Viral load is the total number of copies of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in a patient sample, usually given as particles per milliliter of blood. Samples were collected from 24 Feb 2020 - 2 Apr 2021.

The researchers aimed to examine differences in infectiousness in presymptomatic people and those with mild or no symptoms by such factors as age, sex, and vaccination status; timing and degree of peak infectiousness, loss of infectiousness, increases and decreases in infectiousness rates, and how those rates are associated with symptom onset; and differences in infectiousness due to the properties of different virus variants.

Patients who were presymptomatic, asymptomatic, or mildly symptomatic had higher viral loads at their 1st positive coronavirus test than their hospitalized counterparts for all ages up to 70 years, and viral loads increased with age. Those infected with B117 had a mean viral load 1.05 times higher than those infected by other strains.

Youth had lower average and peak viral loads and an estimated 78% lower peak cell culture probability than adults, although the researchers cautioned that less viral material tends to be collected from children in general.

The researchers estimated a lag of 4.3 days from onset of viral shedding to peak viral load and the highest likelihood of cell culture isolation, which suggests that peak infectiousness could start several days before the appearance of any symptoms.

Culture probability was higher for patients with mild or no symptoms than for hospitalized participants, while probability for patients aged 0-5 years with mild or no symptoms was lower than that in those aged 20-65. Similarly, virus culture probability was an estimated 2.6 times higher for participants with B117 infections than in those infected with other strains.

"Laboratory studies may not as yet be in a position to provide a definitive explanation, but one thing is clear: B117 is more infectious than other variants," lead author Christian Drosten, MD, PhD, said in a Charite-Universitatsmedizin press release.

While patients admitted to the hospital are believed to have uniformly high peak viral loads, the researchers found that peak viral loads of nonhospitalized patients varied. Infections in patients with no or mild symptoms were identified, on average, 5.1 days after their viral loads peaked, compared with 7.4 days in other patients. Mean age of participants with high viral loads was 38 years.

"Our results indicate that PAMS [presymptomatic, asymptomatic, mild symptoms] subjects in apparently healthy groups can be expected to be as infectious as hospitalised patients at the time of detection," the authors wrote. "The relative levels of expected infectious virus shedding of PAMS subjects (including children) is of high importance, because these people are circulating in the community, and it is clear that they can trigger and fuel outbreaks."

Although viral load and cell culture virus isolation probability cannot determine infectiousness directly, especially in the context of society and behavior, they may generate the closest approximation of transmission odds, the authors said. Previous studies have also shown a strong link between SARS-CoV-2 viral load and transmissibility, they note.

Drosten said in the release that the findings "provide a virological foundation for the notion that a minority of infected individuals cause the majority of all transmissions. The fact that this includes so many people without any relevant symptoms underlines the importance of pandemic control measures such as social distancing and mandatory mask-wearing."

[Ref.: Jones TC, Biele G, Muhlemann B, et al.: Estimating infectiousness throughout SARS-CoV-2 infection course. Science. Published online 25 May 2021; eabi5273; DOI: 10.1126/science.abi5273.

"Abstract
Two elementary parameters for quantifying viral infection and shedding are viral load and whether samples yield a replicating virus isolate in cell culture. We examined 25 381 German SARS-CoV-2 cases, including 6110 from test centres attended by pre-symptomatic, asymptomatic, and mildly symptomatic (PAMS) subjects, 9519 who were hospitalised, and 1533 B.1.1.7 lineage infections. The youngest had mean log10 viral load 0.5 (or less) lower than older subjects and an estimated 78% of the peak cell culture replication probability, due in part to smaller swab sizes and unlikely to be clinically relevant. Viral loads above 10e9 copies per swab were found in 8% of subjects, 1/3 of whom were PAMS, with mean age 37.6. We estimate 4.3 days from onset of shedding to peak viral load (8.1) and cell culture isolation probability (0.75). B.1.1.7 subjects had mean log10 viral load 1.05 higher than non-B.1.1.7, with estimated cell culture replication probability 2.6 times higher."

"Summary
Our results indicate that PAMS subjects in apparently healthy groups can be expected to be as infectious as hospitalised patients at the time of detection. The relative levels of expected infectious virus shedding of PAMS subjects (including children) is of high importance because these people are circulating in the community, and it is clear that they can trigger and fuel outbreaks. The results from our time series analysis, and their generally good agreement with results from studies based on other metrics (often epidemiological), show that accurate estimations can be directly obtained from 2 easily measured virological parameters, viral load and sample cell culture infectivity. Such results can be put to many uses: to estimate transmission risk from different groups (by age, gender, clinical status, etc.), quantify variance, show differences in virus variants, highlight and quantify over-dispersion, and inform quarantine, containment, and elimination strategies. Our understanding of the timing and magnitude of change in viral load and infectiousness, including the impact of influencing factors, will continue to improve as data from large studies accumulate and are analyzed. A major ongoing challenge is to connect what we learn about estimated infectiousness from these clinical parameters to highly context-dependent in vivo transmission. Based on our estimates of infectiousness of PAMS subjects and the higher viral load found in subjects infected with the B.1.1.7 variant, we can safely assume that non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing and mask wearing, have been key in preventing many additional outbreaks. Such measures should be employed in all social settings and across all age groups, wherever the virus is present." - Mod.LK]

[2] Heart inflammation
Date: Mon 24 May 2021

The CDC is investigating a few dozen cases of myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle, found in young adults and adolescent vaccine recipients.

The incidents were first reported on 17 May [2021] during a Vaccine Safety Technical (VaST) Work Group meeting. The cases are mild, often follow the 2nd dose of mRNA vaccine, and are more often in males than females.

"Within CDC safety monitoring systems, rates of myocarditis reports in the window following COVID-19 vaccination have not differed from expected baseline rates. However, VaST members felt that information about reports of myocarditis should be communicated to providers," the CDC said.

Yesterday [Sun 23 May 2021] the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association issued a statement recommending vaccines despite these early reports.

"The few cases of myocarditis that have been reported after COVID-19 vaccination are being investigated. However, myocarditis is usually the result of a viral infection, and it is yet to be determined if these cases have any correlation to receiving a COVID-19 vaccine, especially since the COVID-19 vaccines authorized in the US do not contain any live virus," the association said in a statement. "We remain confident that the benefits of vaccination far exceed the very small, rare risks."

["Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart muscle (myocardium). Myocarditis can affect the heart muscle and the heart's electrical system, reducing the heart's ability to pump and causing rapid or abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias).

"A viral infection usually causes myocarditis, but it can result from a reaction to a drug or be part of a more general inflammatory condition. Signs and symptoms include chest pain, fatigue, shortness of breath, and arrhythmias.

"Severe myocarditis weakens the heart so that the rest of the body doesn't get enough blood. Clots can form in the heart, leading to a stroke or heart attack" (https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/myocarditis/symptoms-causes/syc-20352539).

Fortunately, the cases that have been observed are mild. - Mod.LK]

[3] Fungal infections
Date: Thu 27 May 2021

https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/baroda/nasal-aspergillosis-another-fungal-infection-on-the-rise-in-vadodara-7331961/


Even as concern grows over the increasing number of mucormycosis cases in the city, doctors have reported cases of another invasive fungal infection -- aspergillosis -- among COVID-positive patients as well as those who have recovered from the virus.

Vadodara, which has 262 patients undergoing treatment for mucormycosis in 2 government hospitals -- SSG and Gotri medical college -- now has at least 8 patients of aspergillosis in SSG, admitted over the past week.

SSG also has 13 patients of _Candida auris_, an invasive, multi-drug-resistant yeast infection that is being found in COVID-19 patients.

Dr Sheetal Mistry, advisor for COVID-19 to the city and district administration, told this newspaper, "Pulmonary aspergillosis is commonly seen in immuno-compromised patients, but aspergillosis of the sinuses is rare. We are seeing it now in patients who have recovered from COVID or are undergoing treatment. Although aspergillosis is not as mutilating as mucormycosis, it is also invasive. The fungal infections seen these days are mostly invasive in the rhino-orbital-cerebral passage."

Mistry attributes the growing cases of fungal infections to the usage of steroids for treating COVID patients as well as the use of non-sterile water used for hydrating the oxygen supply.

Mistry said, "Fungal infections are opportunistic in nature and feed on glucose. Therefore, patients with a history of diabetes, who have undergone a rigorous course of steroids to treat COVID-19, as well as those who have turned diabetic following COVID-19 infection are at risk of developing the fungal infection. We are also observing low counts of lymphocytes in the blood (lymphopenia), which compromises on immunity and makes way for fungal infections."

[Aspergillosis of the head and neck region primarily affects the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. There are more than 185 species of _Aspergillus_, and over 95 % of all infections are caused by _Aspergillus fumigatus_, _Aspergillus flavus_, and _Aspergillus niger_. Disease may present with nasal polyps, anterior and posterior nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, epistaxis, headache, anosmia, proptosis, or snoring.

_Aspergillus_ as a pathogen cannot actively penetrate undamaged and intact mucus membrane or skin as it lacks keratolytic enzymes. Aspergillosis is now classified into invasive (acute fulminant, chronic invasive, granulomatous invasive) and non-invasive (fungus ball and allergic fungal rhinosinusitis) forms with their own pathophysiology and clinical presentation. Any type of paranasal aspergillosis may progress to a more aggressive disease illustrating the importance of early recognition.

Previously, scientists thought aspergillosis occurred almost entirely in people with severely weakened immune systems. However, aspergillosis has been increasingly reported in patients without weakened immune systems but who have severe respiratory infections caused by viruses, including influenza. Several recent reports describe COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA).

Clearly, as the above report indicates, a whole spectrum of fungal diseases is being reported in COVID patients with compromised immunological status, particularly in diabetics. These fungal co-infections are reported with increasing frequency and can be associated with severe illness and death. Awareness of the possibility of fungal co-infection is essential to reduce delays in diagnosis and treatment in order to help prevent severe illness and death from these infections. - Mod.UBA]
