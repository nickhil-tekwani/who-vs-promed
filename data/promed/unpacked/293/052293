Officials with the Provincial Health Office are reporting the deaths of 3 children in Negros Occidental in the Central Visayas region of the Philippines. Records show that the victims, ages 9, 10, and 12 years old, came from the cities of Victorias and Sipalay and the town of Toboso. The 10-year-old female died on 3 Jul [2015], while a 9-year-old male passed away on 15 Jul, and a 12-year-old male on 21 Jul 2015.

According to the World Health Organization, the Philippines is among the top 10 countries in terms of rabies problems. It is responsible for the deaths of 200 to 300 Filipinos per year. In 2010, 257 died of rabies, and in 2011, 202 deaths were reported.

At least 1/3 of deaths due to human rabies are among children less than 15 years old. Animal bite cases have been increasing for the past 5 years. At least 328 459 persons in 2011, and 266 220 individuals in 2010 were bitten by animals. Almost half of rabies exposures are among school children.

Dogs remain the principal cause of animal bites and rabies cases. It was estimated that of the 9 million dogs across the country, only 1 million are vaccinated against rabies. March was Rabies Awareness Month in the Philippines, which has the ultimate goal of making the Philippines rabies-free by the year 2020.

[A check of the OIE zoonosis data showed that in 2013 the Philippines suffered 199 deaths from rabies, only a minor downward shift in incidence. We will not see a major downward shift until 8 million more dogs have been vaccinated. But as each province gets a hold on vaccinating dogs, we will see their numbers drop. This will encourage the others, 1 by 1. These child cases show that there are separate canine rabies problems in Victorias, Sipalay, and Toboso.
