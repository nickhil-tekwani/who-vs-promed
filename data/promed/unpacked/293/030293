Huge quantities of nuts tainted with a carcinogenic substance are
being sold in the markets of Riyadh, according to recent media reports.
Al-Riyadh newspaper said it received copies of documents relating to
the issue from the Food and Drug Committee, which is taking necessary
steps to deal with the problem.
The committee said that peanuts tainted with aflatoxin, a deadly
poison produced by certain fungi in food and which can cause liver
damage and cancer, are being sold in Riyadh. Aflatoxin is often found
in nuts stored in poor conditions.
A random sample of nuts was examined by the Food and Drug Committee
and found tainted with aflatoxin. However, the kinds of nuts and
their country of origin were not mentioned in the report. Health
specialists said there was an urgent need to remove all contaminated
nuts from the market to protect consumers' health.
Dr. Abdul Rahman Al-Qahtani, a health specialist, urged the Food and
Drug Committee to be open and inform people about an issue that can
potentially affect their health.
"The committee must disclose the names of the countries from which
these nuts originate, even if this harms businessmen and investors,"
Al-Qahtani added.
Tumadir Kurdi, a specialist in food poisoning, said that aflatoxin is
highly dangerous. "Aflatoxin may lead to fetus deformation and result
in growth problems," she said, adding that nuts, rice and milk can
all be affected by aflatoxin.
Kurdi said that the toxic substance could damage the liver, cause
lung cancer if inhaled and lead to serious poisoning if a person eats
great amounts of food tainted by aflatoxin. "When eating such food, a
person starts vomiting, gets fever, and suffers a stomachache. The
skin ultimately turns yellow. Antibiotics would not be very helpful,"
she added.

Aflatoxin is a naturally occurring mycotoxin produced by 2 types of
molds: _Aspergillus flavus_ and _Aspergillus parasiticus_.
_Aspergillus flavus_ is common and widespread in nature and is most
often found when certain grains are grown under stressful conditions
such as drought. The mold occurs in soil, decaying vegetation, hay,
and grains undergoing microbiological deterioration and invades all
types of organic substrates whenever and wherever the conditions are
favorable for its growth. Favorable conditions include high moisture
content and high temperature. At least 13 different types of
aflatoxin are produced in nature, with aflatoxin B1 considered as the
most toxic. While the presence of _Aspergillus flavus_ does not
always indicate harmful levels of aflatoxin, it does mean that the
potential for aflatoxin production is present. (From:
<http://www.usda.gov/gipsa/newsroom/backgrounders/b-aflatox.htm>).
Aflatoxins are acutely toxic and have been shown to be carcinogenic
for some animals. Their toxicity varies between different species,
but data from a large outbreak of poisoning in India in 1974, which
involved moldy maize and in which nearly 100 people died, suggests
that the toxicity of aflatoxin B1 for humans lies somewhere between
that for the dog and that for the rat. The involvement of aflatoxins
with human cancer is more complex and remains to be defined. (From:
<http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/capacity/en/2.pdf>).
For aflatoxin to appear in the milk of an animal, aflatoxin must be
consumed by the animal. Although aflatoxin is well documented to
appear in the milk of cattle, I am uncertain that it would appear in
the milk of camels. It is likely that it would, but camel physiology
is different than that of cattle.
Nevertheless, aflatoxin is not known to kill immediately. It usually
requires some time and some accumulation of the toxin or damage from
the toxin. Also, aflatoxin quickly leaves the body once consumption
is halted. Deaths from aflatoxin are generally in the form of liver
failure or liver cancer. Although other organs may fail when the
patient (regardless of species) is near death, aflatoxin is not
acutely associated with such things as kidney failure. Yellow skin is
a reflection of the affects on the liver and not directly related to
aflatoxin intoxication. Furthermore, there are liver-supportive
drugs, and given time, the liver can heal itself unless it has become
cancerous. Antibiotics are not effective in treating a toxin nor are
they indicated as a liver support agent.
It is unlikely that this occurrence will result in immediate human
cases or even immediate animal cases. Aflatoxin takes some time to
produce an effect unless doses are overwhelmingly high. Animals will
sometimes refuse such feed, and one wonders why humans would not
refuse such also. - Mod.TG]
