Inner-city Brisbane is the hot spot of Queensland's worst Ross River virus outbreak in almost 20 years.

Authorities are virtually powerless to stop the spread of the disease, which was sparked by swarms of mosquitoes flushed out by storms and king tides at the start of the year.

Since 1 Jan [2015], the virus has struck down more than 2835 people -- about 500 more than the entire tally last year [2014].

Queensland Health data shows most Ross River victims are aged between 25-39 and most live in Brisbane's Metro South and Metro North regions. More than 350 people have contracted the virus on the Gold Coast and 203 on the Sunshine Coast. The Cairns region, which is already battling a dengue outbreak, has recorded 193 cases.

Dr Sonya Bennett, senior director for Queensland Health's Communicable Disease Unit, said the state had not recorded a Ross River outbreak of this magnitude since 1996.

The virus is transmitted from animals such as wallabies and possums to humans by mosquitoes that breed in salt marshes, rivers and even containers on urban properties. "Heavy rains and high tides for much of the year so far have provided a perfect environment for an explosion in these mosquito numbers across the southern part of Queensland," Dr Bennett said. "These conditions have only been made worse as a result of the flooding and other associated effects of recent Cyclone Marcia."

Brisbane City Council has carried out a major mosquito control program to kill off as much of the population as possible but entomologists say total eradication of the pest is impossible.

The disease causes symptoms including headaches, fevers, joint or muscle pain, rash and fatigue and patients can be off work for several days.

A vaccine for the virus has been developed but the designer, Queensland virologist Professor John Aaskov, said governments and suppliers were reluctant to take it up because of the costs of producing it.

Dr Bennett said residents could take preventive measures such as using approved repellents, removing breeding spots from homes and putting screens on windows and doors.

[With more than 380 cases of Ross River virus (RRV) infection diagnosed on 12 Feb 2015 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20150218.3167404), the number climbed to 1000 just 2 weeks later, and that number now has risen to 2835 cases. As Steve Berger noted in his background comment, Queensland accounts for approximately 50 per cent of Ross River virus infections in Australia.

Notwithstanding increasing reports during January to February 2015, rates in Queensland have remained fairly constant for over 2 decades (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20150219.3176519). As reported in a 24 Jan 2015 ProMED-mail post (archive no. 20150126.3121230), New South Wales is also having a significant outbreak, with 322 cases as of late January 2015, and there have been 3 cases in Canberra. RRV transmission to humans, although sporadic in Australia, occurs during the wet season, when vector mosquitoes are abundant.

RRV is a zoonotic alphavirus transmitted by a wide range of mosquitoes including _Aedes_ and _Culex_ species. Although not fatal, it causes acute polyarthritis [pains in the joints] in humans that may persist long after the acute phase of the infection is over. The recommendations to avoid mosquito bites are prudent and should be adopted by individuals living in or visiting these hot spots.
