The administrator of Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), Muhammad Hussain Syed, has said that 40 per cent of up to 500 people, who got infected with leprosy every year in the country, belonged to Karachi. So it is totally wrong to state that this disease has been spreading in only colder regions or the north of the country.

During a visit to Marie Adelaide Leprosy Centre in Saddar on Wednesday [19 Dec 2012], the administrator of KMC said that Pakistan had been able to overcome the leprosy epidemic and the figure had decreased to 400 to 500 victims annually. The KMC chief announced a Rs1 million [USD 10 270] grant to Marie Adelaide Centre for rendering valuable services in the field. He said that India ranked number one on the list of countries with patients as every year some [126 000] people there contracted infected with the disease every year. Brazil was second on the list, he said.

He said that the World Health Organization (WHO) had been cooperating in various countries, including Pakistan, for free-of-cost treatment for leprosy patients. He said that at the outset of proper treatment for the skin disease, large ratio of the infecting bacteria died out while the chances of transmission to people in the surroundings of the infected person also decreased.

He said that in case of ill-treatment and lack of attention, bacteria of chronic disease had the ability to get transmitted to people in the immediate surroundings of the patient. He said that guardians and elders of persons suffering from leprosy should immediately consult a doctor in order to avoid disability. He said that leprosy is a 100 per cent curable disease but the aliment should be properly diagnosed and followed by speedy treatment. The KMC administrator, on the occasion, praised the services of Dr Ruth Pfau in the treatment and arrest of leprosy disease in the country.

The chief executive of the Leprosy Centre, Mervyn Lobo, in his briefing on the occasion said that Marie Adelaide had been running 170 centres in Pakistan and Azad Kashmir for treating thousands of leprosy patients along with patients suffering from tuberculosis. The Marie Adelaide Centre in Saddar had the ability to admit 34 patients at a time and rendered treatment free-of-cost.

The administrator offered to assist the management of the Marie Adelaide Leprosy Centre to open up more leprosy treatment centres in the Landhi, Korangi, and North Karachi.

[Leprosy is a chronic disease caused by a bacillus, _Mycobacterium leprae_ (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs101/en/). _M. leprae_ multiplies very slowly and the incubation period of the disease is about 5 years. Symptoms can take even as long as 20 years to appear. Although leprosy is not highly contagious, because patients with the lepromatous form of leprosy excrete enormous numbers of leprosy bacilli in their nasal secretions (that is, are multibacillary), a patient with untreated lepromatous leprosy poses increased risk for transmission of the infection to close, long-term contacts, such as household members. As the organism is also present in skin lesions in these patients, skin contact is thought to be another mode of spread. Because the organisms that are shed by lepromatous patients can persist on surfaces in the environment, fomites are also a potential source of infection. Casual and short-term contact does not seem pose a risk for spread the disease.

Leprosy is treated with dapsone, rifampin, and clofazimine. These drugs are provided by WHO free to all patients in the world since 1995; see http://www.novartis.com/corporate-responsibility/access-to-healthcare/our-key-initiatives/eliminating-leprosy.shtml. Patients are no longer infectious after the 1st dose of the treatment regimen. Patients with paucibacillary leprosy treated with rifampin and dapsone are cured within 6 months and multibacillary patients treated with rifampin, dapsone, and clofazimine are cured within 12 months. Between 1985 and 2005, more than 15 million leprosy cases were cured globally.

Pakistan belongs to the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR), which reports only a small proportion of the global new leprosy cases. Leprosy has been eliminated as a public health problem (that is, has a prevalence of less than 1 case per 10 000 population) from all countries of the EMR, except South Sudan (http://www.emro.who.int/health-topics/leprosy/). Some countries in the EMR still have a few districts that have not achieved elimination, such as Sudan, Egypt, and Yemen. South Sudan is the only country from the EMR among the 17 countries globally reporting more than 1000 new cases annually. Sudan, Egypt, Pakistan, and Yemen report between 300 and 900 new cases per year. Morocco, Afghanistan, Islamic Republic of Iran, and Somalia report fewer than 100 new cases annually.

India, Brazil, and Indonesia are the 3 countries that have the greatest number of leprosy cases. The top 10 countries in new case detections in 2005 are India, Brazil, Indonesia, DR Congo, Bangladesh, Nepal, Mozambique, Nigeria, Ethiopia, and Tanzania. Together, they constitute about 96 per cent of year 2005's global new case detections.

WHO emphasizes that sustained political commitment and adequate resources for leprosy services are required, especially for currently under-served population groups such as remote rural areas, urban slums, migrant labor, to sustain elimination at national levels, and progress towards further reducing the burden of leprosy. Also strengthening integration of leprosy services into the general health system through capacity building and skill development is required to ensure and sustain quality leprosy services, including diagnosis and treatment and prevention/care of disabilities (http://www.who.int/lep/resources/SEAGLP20062.pdf).

Karachi is a coastal city in the south of Pakistan, with an estimated population of 21 million people in 2012. It is the world's largest city in terms of population, and is Pakistan's main seaport and its centre of banking, industry, economic activity and trade, as well as the capital of the province of Sindh (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karachi).
