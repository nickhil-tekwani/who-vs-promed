[2] Bluetongue: French preparation on border with Spain
Date: Thu 8 Nov 2007
From: Susan Baekeland <grolleyog@Wanadoo.fr>


The French Ministry of Agriculture reports that there have been 3
cases of serotype 1 of the bluetongue virus [BTV] in the Spanish
Canton of Irun in the Basque Country of Spain.

The French Department of Pyrenees Atlantic, which has a frontier with
Irun, has now been designated an interdicted area, that is, no stock
movements out of the restricted zone.

Here, in France, we have 3 types of designation (see
<http://agriculture.gouv.fr/sections/thematiques/sante-protection-animaux/maladies-animales/fievre-catarrhale-ovine/fichiers-telecharger-2/downloadFile/FichierAttache_16_f0/pds_071107.pdf>):
[Interdiction zone], [Regulated zone], and [Surveillance zone].

[This map shows, in addition to the control program zones for BTV-8,
an interdiction zone for BTV-1 (pink) in the southwest of the country
in the French Department of Pyrenees Atlantic. - Mod.PC]

[The following terms and their English translations are used as
descriptors for the map: Zone en jaune pale (pale yellow zone)
Perimetres interdits deja en place serotype 8 (interdicted perimeters
already in place for serotype 8); Zone en jaune vif (bright yellow
zone) Nouveaux perimetres interdits serotype 8 (new interdicted
perimeters for serotype 8); Zone en bleu (blue zone) Zone reglementee
serotype 8 (regulated zone for serotype 8); Zone en bleu hachure
(hatched blue zone) Nouvelle zone reglementee serotype 8 (new
regulated zone for serotype 8). - CopyEd.MJ]

[3] Bluetongue - UK: request for information

[The following is copied from the news section of the Farmers Weekly
website containing a question and answer session with Prof Hugh
Pennington. See the source URL for the complete text and an
interesting interview on a wide range of animal and public health
issues. - Mod.PC]

"Q: Are you surprised by the arrival of the bluetongue virus?
Bluetongue has been expected for a long time, partly for the wrong
reason. The midge, which has transmitted it around the Mediterranean,
is very temperature-dependent and was moving northwards so, in the
fullness of time with global warming, it was expected to arrive,
bringing bluetongue with it. In fact the virus we have is not the
same as that occurring in southern Europe -- there are unanswered
questions about this. Will our winter kill it off?

A: The crucial factor will be temperature -- it needs an average
temperature of 12 deg C (54 deg F) year-round. We are not absolutely
certain if it is a question of the midges surviving or the virus
surviving in infected animals and in doing so harbouring a reservoir
of virus for midges the next year."

This statement gives the impression that _Culicoides imicola_ is
involved in BTV-8 transmission in the UK. I should be grateful to
learn whether recent vector surveys have shown the presence of _C.
imicola_ in the outbreak regions[. - SZ]
