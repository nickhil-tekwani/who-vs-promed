CDC/WHO travel recommendations
------------------------------
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have been working
closely with the World Health Organization (WHO) and other international
partners to track cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Since
16 Dec 2003, the Chinese Ministry of Health has reported 4 cases of SARS (3
confirmed and 1 probable). All 4 cases are from Guangdong, the same
province where the first case of SARS in 2003 was confirmed in a 32 year
old man and where the first cases of SARS were identified in November 2002.
All 4 patients have recovered from their illness and have been discharged
from the hospital. None of their contacts have developed SARS-like illness.
The source of infection of the 4 patients is not known; however, SARS
coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the virus that causes SARS, has been collected from
cages that housed civet cats in the restaurant where one of the patients
worked. The Chinese Ministry of Health continues to work in close
collaboration with WHO to broaden the investigation and enhance
surveillance throughout China. For additional information about these
cases, see: <http://www.who.int/csr/sars/archive/en/>.
Currently CDC and WHO do not recommend that the general public avoid travel
to any of the countries affected by SARS. Previous SARS research has shown
that SARS can be controlled and contained through early detection,
isolation of suspect cases, and tracing of their contacts. In addition,
based on limited available data, it would be prudent for travelers to China
to avoid going to live food markets and having direct contact with civets
and other wildlife from these markets. Although there is no evidence that
direct contact with civets or other wild animals from live food markets has
led to cases of SARS, viruses similar to the SARS-CoV have been found in
these animals, and some humans working with these animals have evidence of
infection with SARS-CoV, or a very similar virus.
CDC will provide updates on SARS
(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/index.htm>) and Travelers' Health
(<http://www.cdc.gov/travel>) websites as further information becomes
available.
Additional information about SARS for clinicians and the public can also be
found at the CDC SARS website (<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars)> and the
WHO SARS website (<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/en/index.html>).
