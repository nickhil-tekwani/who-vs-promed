Indonesia has impounded more than 200 tonnes of garlic. The garlic was imported from China in mid-February [2018] and after arriving at Jakarta's port was shipped to the island of Sumatra, the country's Agriculture Ministry said.

Despite being certified as free of pests in China, samples of the shipment contained _Ditylenchus dipsaci_, a microscopic worm that infects onions and garlic. [The] Ministry stated, "This could be very damaging to our garlic farming."

[_Ditylenchus dipsaci_ (stem and bulb nematode) is considered one of the most devastating plant parasites in temperate regions. Several pathogen races exist affecting more than 450 plant species, including important vegetable, cereal and legume crops. The onion and garlic race can also affect peas, beetroot, pumpkins, rhubarb, ornamental bulbs and several weeds. Symptoms in garlic include yellowing and necrosis of leaves, bulb scales are loosened, and bulb stems crack. Young plants can be killed by high infestations. Asymptomatic bulbs may still contain low nematode levels. Pathogen development continues during storage of bulbs, which may lead to large crop losses. Affected tissue is more susceptible to secondary fungal or bacterial rots.

Young nematodes feed on leaves, stems and bulbs, adults move into the soil once plant tissues become too degraded. They can be spread with water, soil, planting material or by mechanical means (such as contaminated equipment). Disease management includes exclusion, long crop rotations with non-host species, control of potential pathogen reservoirs, use of certified clean seed bulbs and soil pre-treatment with nematicides (drenching or fumigation). Thermotherapy of planting material and systemic nematicides in seed production are being used in some areas. Eradication of soil nematodes is extremely difficult and emphasis is often placed on keeping numbers below economically significant thresholds.

In China, an outbreak of the related potato rot nematode (_D. destructor_) was reported in 2017 (ProMED-mail post 20171207.5490078). This species can cause serious yield losses in potatoes and can also affect a range of other crops. _D. angustus_, the rice stem nematode, causes an important disease of deep-water rice ("Ufra"), as well as irrigated and rain-fed lowland rice, mainly in Asia.
