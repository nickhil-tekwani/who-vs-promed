Young's to stop selling, using unpasteurized milk
Health officials say salmonella outbreak ended
----------------------------------------------
Young's Jersey Dairy will no longer sell or use raw milk, ending a 45-year
tradition, after a salmonella outbreak infected 50 people last month. The
popular Clark County family business accepted a state recommendation and
announced Thu 16 Jan 2003 that it has surrendered its raw milk retail
license. Young's was the only place in Ohio where the product was legally sold.
"The Young family has looked painstakingly at whether we should continue
the sale of unpasteurized milk on our farm. It is part of our history. In
fact, it was the first product we ever sold here directly to the public,"
Dan Young, the dairy's chief executive officer, said. "After looking at
everything, we felt like it was the right thing to do, to ensure that we
could stay in business."
The store was the focus of an investigation by the state departments of
health and agriculture after customers had who consumed milk or milk
products there complained of becoming sick.
On Thu 16 Jan 2003, local health officials said the outbreak has ended.
Unpasteurized milk, which Young's previously sold in bottles and used in
its milk shakes, caused the majority of illnesses, local health officials
said. Salmonella-related symptoms include vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, and
abdominal pain. State officials began investigating the dairy 10 Dec 2002.
On the recommendation of the Clark County Combined Health District, the
dairy stopped selling its bottled milk and began using pasteurized milk in
shakes. Pasteurization is a heating process that kills contaminants such as
salmonella.
16 of the 50 people confirmed with the food-borne bacteria were Young's
employees. Tests of the employees, customers, and their families revealed
that those infected came from 12 counties in Ohio and 2 other states Tests
confirming salmonella in skim milk and cream from Young's led the Ohio
Department of Agriculture to recommend that the dairy discontinue selling
bottled raw milk, skim milk, and cream.
Young said the decision to give up the raw milk license came after
evaluating several factors, including customer safety, customer loyalty,
and the ability to secure insurance.
The same bacterial strain found in the confirmed salmonella cases also
existed in Ross and Columbiana counties last year [2002] before the local
outbreak, leading health officials to conclude the strain found at Young's
probably traveled from one of those counties and did not originate at the
dairy. Health officials have not been able to determine how the strain got
to Young's.
"We feel the outbreak is over," said Charles Patterson, Clark County's
health commissioner. "We want to follow up on those who have been shown to
be positive (for salmonella)." The health district, he said, wants to make
sure those infected -- even if they don't show symptoms -- show negative
results in 2 tests taken 24 hours apart to ensure they are free of the
bacteria and allow them to return to a restaurant and other public settings.
"We certainly don't want anybody to get sick or any food service or another
county to go through what's happened over the last month," Patterson said.
Young's began selling raw milk in 1958. In 1999, the dairy became the only
retailer permitted by Ohio law to sell raw milk. A grandfather clause
allowed dairies that already sold the product before October 1965 to
continue to do so.
Young said milk products make up less than 5 percent of the family
operation, which also includes a gift shop, the Golden Jersey Inn, and
recreational areas. The dairy has served more than 20 million customers in
nearly 5 decades, Young said.
