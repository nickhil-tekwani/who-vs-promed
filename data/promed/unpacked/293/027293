11 deaths due to Yellow Fever in Norte de Santander
---------------------
The outbreak is in rural Convention [Norte de Santander Department, on the
northern Venezuelan border - PN], 270 kilometers to the northwest of
Cucuta. The total number of deaths may be higher if there is confirmation
on the deaths of 60 people in the area of El Suspiro in Tibu. Information
is from the Benito Ovalle Hospital in Convencion.

The first reported case presented to the hospital on 2 Jun 2003, a 13 year
old boy who died than next day in Ocana. The boy came from the area known
as Honduras, 5 hours from Convencion and from there was admitted to the
Emiro Quintero Hospital of Ocana.

According to the authorities there is a shortage of 15 000 doses of
vaccine. The area involved is an area with ongoing political strife which
is also impacting on control measures. According to reports the population
affected are farmers who have been displaced due to the political strife in
the area. It is possible that the farmers were infected in the displaced
zone and then returned to their areas of residence already infected. It is
presumed that the disease came through the border with Venezuela.

The medical coordinator of the hospital, Luis Carlos Moreno, has requested
vaccines from the local Health Department and the National Ministry of
Health, stating the need to vaccinate over 20 000 farmers in the
area. This hospital has reported 27 cases.

Dr Moreno said that the deceased are, in his great majority, inhabitants of
Gramal, Cartagenita, El Cobre, and El Loro in Convencion, and Eden in the
municipality of Carmen, all located about 7 hours from Cucuta. This is the
second epidemic of yellow fever in this area, following a massive outbreak
in 1978.

"We are, at this moment, analyzing if the disease is being easily
transmitted due to the jungle density in El Catatumbo or if this is an
outbreak that has entered from Venezuela" Dr Moreno said.

This week a medical team, supported by the International Red Cross, will be
visiting the areas of Alto de Ventanas, Bella Union and Honduras in Convencion.

[More information on this outbreak would be appreciated. As this newswire
suggests this outbreak is along the Colombia/Venezuela border, information
on possible yellow fever activity in the neighboring area in Venezuela
would be appreciated as well. Of note, in a Jan 2003 ProMED-mail posting
there was a report of the death of 22 monkeys in this area near the
Colombia Venezuela border and the possibility of yellow fever was raised at
that time. More information on the results of the testing performed in
Cucuta Colombia at that time would also be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
