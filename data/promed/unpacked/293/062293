----------------------------------------------------------------------
Cassava (_Manihot esculenta_) is one of the staple foods in Africa, cultivated in around 40 countries. In Côte d'Ivoire, [it] is widely used [and] has become an alternative income source in coconut-growing areas, since the Côte d'Ivoire lethal yellowing phytoplasma (CILY, 16SrXXII-B, '_Candidatus_ Phytoplasma palmicola-related strains') devastated over 400 hectares of coconut plantations.

Recently, symptoms of leaf mosaic, curling and yellowing were observed in cassava orchards in Grand-Lahou [Lagunes district], which are currently affected by CILY. Leaf samples were collected at random from 12 symptomatic and 2 symptomless cassava plants from 2 villages. PCR with primers that specifically target the 16S rRNA gene and part of the intergenic region 16/23S rRNA gene of the Cape St Paul Wilt Disease phytoplasma (16SrXXII-B) from Ghana [was carried out]. Amplicons were produced from 6 of the 12 symptomatic samples but not from the 2 symptomless plants. Amplicons from each sample were sequenced. A consensus sequence was compared to those of other phytoplasmas in GenBank. Sequences from all samples shared 100 per cent sequence identity and were 99 per cent similar to those of the 16SrXXII-B phytoplasmas, including the CILY phytoplasma.

The Côte d'Ivoire cassava phytoplasma and the CILY phytoplasma exhibited identical AluI, RsaI, TaqI, HaeIII, BstUI, KpnI, HhaI, HinfI, HpaI, HpaII, MseI, Sau3AI, DraI, and BfaI [restriction enzyme analysis] RFLP profiles. Phylogenetic analysis supported the grouping of the Côte d'Ivoire cassava phytoplasma within the 16SrXXII-B cluster, closely related to '_Ca._ P. palmicola' (16SrXXII-A).

To our knowledge this is the 1st report of a phytoplasma affecting cassava in Côte d'Ivoire. The findings suggest that cassava may be a potential alternative host for the CILY phytoplasma, which poses a serious threat for food security of smallholder coconut and cassava farmers.

[Lethal yellowing (LY) diseases of coconut and other palms are caused by phytoplasmas of the palm lethal yellowing (LY or 16SrIV) group. A number of LY strains have been described from the Caribbean, Latin America, Africa, and southern Asia. LY has seriously jeopardised coconut industries in the respective areas. LY-type diseases like Cape St Paul wilt (CSPW) in Ghana, the "maladie de Kaincope" in Togo and Awka disease (lethal decline, LD) in Nigeria, previously included in 16SrIV group, have been reclassified as the new group 16SrXXII (Nigerian coconut lethal decline (LDN) group).

Symptoms include premature nut drop, blackening of inflorescences, yellowing of fronds, and death of the palm usually within 4 to 6 months. The planthopper _Myndus crudus_ is suspected to be the vector in the Americas, but different vectors may be involved in the spread of LY strains elsewhere. Seed transmission of the pathogens cannot be excluded and some weed species may serve as pathogen reservoirs (see for example ProMED-mail post 20070910.2983). Jumps of LY across apparently unaffected coconut populations have been observed, possibly due to aerial spread of infectious vector insects or human activities. Commercial control of LY relies on resistant varieties, but an unexplained resistance breakdown of some widely used hybrids (ProMED-mail post 20070522.1643) is causing great concern.

A phytoplasma with 99 per cent homology to the Cape St Paul wilt pathogen was reported for the 1st time from Ivory Coast in 2013 on coconut palms (ProMED-mail post 20130817.1885487). The detection of this phytoplasma now in cassava is doubly important, in that it identifies another disease of this essential crop as well as a widespread reservoir host for the pathogen.
