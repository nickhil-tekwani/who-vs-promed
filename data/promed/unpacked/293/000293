The local health agency in Banyumas regency has diagnosed around 200
residents from villages in 3 districts as being infected with the
mosquito-borne chikungunya virus (CHIKV).

Around 100 of them were from Sumpiuh district, and the rest from
Somagede and Kemranjen districts, all bordering each other. Banyumas
Health Agency head Gempol Suwandono told reporters Wednesday [18 Mar
2009] the 3 districts were vulnerable to the disease.

"We received reports from each community health center in the 3
districts" he said. He added that the 3 districts were labeled as
vulnerable areas a few years ago. "3 years ago, we determined they
were safe, but now the disease has recurred," Gempol said, adding that
many swampy areas and stagnant pools were found in the districts, thus
providing good breeding grounds for osquitoes. "I have urged
residents to maintain cleanliness and not leave stagnant water lying
around."

[The "swampy areas" mentioned by the local health agency
representative may breed mosquitoes, but not the vectors of
chikungunya virus. Cleaning up water catchments where the vector
_Aedes aegypti_ breeds is good advice. Chikungunya virus continues to
circulate in Java this year (2009).

[It is not clear whether these cases were lab confirmed or only
clinically diagnosed. In the latter case they could have been
confused with dengue, since the symptoms are very similar, and dengue
traditionally peaks in Java in March -- see ProMED archive
