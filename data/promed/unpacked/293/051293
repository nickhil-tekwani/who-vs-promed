A new study has found that the majority of residents in a rural village of Viet Nam harbored multi-drug-resistant (MDR), colistin-resistant _Escherichia coli_ bacteria. Colistin is typically used as a last-resort treatment when there are no other therapy options available. The research is presented at ASM Microbe, the annual meeting of the American Society for Microbiology, held from [7 to 11 Jun 2018] in Atlanta, GA.

"These results revealed the dissemination of MDR colistin-resistant _E. coli_, harboring the colistin-resistant mobile gene mcr among commensal bacteria of residents, in a rural community in Viet Nam," said Yoshimasa Yamamoto, of Osaka University, Osaka, Japan, presenting author on the study. The colistin-resistant bacteria were detected in 71.4 per cent of the residents in Nguyen Xa village in Viet Nam. All the colistin-resistant isolates were identified as _E. coli_.

The proportion of households that had members possessing colistin-resistant _E. coli_ was also quite high (80.6 per cent). A total of 69 of the 70 colistin-resistant _E. coli_ isolates possessed either mcr-1 and/or mcr-3. Only one colistin-resistant isolate did not contain any mcr-1 to mcr-5 genes. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of mcr (+) isolates to colistin were 8 microg/ml. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis indicated no clonal expansion of any specific strain. The majority of mcr (+) isolates showed that the rate of multidrug resistance (MDR) of colistin-resistant _E. coli_ isolates was 91.4 percent, which means that they show resistance to at least 1 antibiotic drug in 3 or more antibiotic classes.

"It is a remarkable finding from a public health viewpoint that most households that participated in the study had colistin-resistant _E. coli_ carriers," said Dr Yamamoto, "Thus, this requires urgent public health attention."

The researchers conducted the study in Nguyen Xa village, Thai Binh province, Viet Nam, from November [2017] to February [2018]. The village, a representative rural community in Viet Nam, had 7730 residents in 2008 households in 2015. A total of 98 healthy participants from 36 households were enrolled (an increase from what was recorded in the abstract). The researchers obtained one stool specimen from each participant to test for the presence of colistin-resistant _E. coli_, using a selective medium.

Current reports show an increase in colistin-resistant bacteria worldwide due to the abuse of colistin in the livestock sector. Furthermore, the discovery of mobile antibiotic resistance genes, such as mcr-1, in 2015 indicates the possibility of further spread of colistin-resistance to other bacteria. Extensive studies on colistin-resistant bacteria possessing mcr are being carried out on infectious disease specimens and livestock. The colistin-resistance with mcr represents an emerging global health threat.

"The susceptibility and exposure of local residents living in the areas of frequent usage of colistin in livestock to the colistin-resistant bacteria remains to be studied," said Dr Yamamoto. The carriage of colistin-resistant bacteria with mobile resistance genes by human residents may increase the risk of acquiring intractable infections.

[In November 2015 the 1st plasmid-encoded colistin resistance gene mcr-1 was detected in livestock and raw meat samples as well as human beings in China [1]. In Viet Nam, mcr-1 gene was detected in _E coli_ isolates from pigs and slaughter house, as colistin resistance _E coli_ in January 2016 [2].

Colistin (polymyxin E) and polymyxin B are polypeptide antibiotics; polymyxins are rarely used in human medicine but widely used in veterinary medicine. Colistin is given to chickens and other farm animals to make them gain weight faster and as pre-emptive protection against diseases.

Despite its high toxicity, colistin is a last resort antimicrobial for the treatment of severe infections caused by highly resistant bacteria in human medicine.

Detailed studies relating colistin use with a reduction of multi-resistance plasmids at the farm level are lack of evidence. Aminopenicillins, trimethoprim-sulfonamides, tetracyclines, aminoglycosides, cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones are the alternatives to colistin usage in animals.

Although food producing animals are the main concern for the transmission of AMR (antimicrobial resistance) from animals to man, also the risk of transmission of AMR via direct contact from companion animals should be considered.

The mobile colistin resistance (_mcr_) genes confer plasmid-mediated resistance to colistin, an antibiotic of last-resort used for treating Gram negative bacillary infections resistant to most other antibiotics. Location on a plasmid allows spread of colistin resistance within and between different species of bacteria through horizontal gene transfer. There are now 5 mcr genes (mcr-1, mcr-2, mcr-3, mcr-4, and mcr-5), and variants of those genes, each with different DNA sequences. mcr-1 was first described in China in 2015 and then elsewhere in the world in various bacterial isolates (such as _Escherichia coli_, _Salmonella enterica_, _Klebsiella pneumoniae_, _Enterobacter aerogenes_, and _Enterobacter cloacae_) isolated from humans, multiple other animal species, and the environment. As of 2017, mcr-1 has been detected in more than 30 countries on 5 continents (http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2017/08/more-colistin-resistance-genes-identified-europe). - Mod.ML
