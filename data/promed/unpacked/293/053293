With reference to inquiries regarding monkeypox in Zaire, WHO does not
recommend reintroduction of vaccination with the vaccine which effectively
eradicated smallpox in the 1970s and which also protects against monkeypox.
Monkeypox is a rare viral disease with a clinical presentation similar to
that of smallpox. It is largely limited to populations who come into contact
with animals that harbour monkeypox virus in remote areas of the tropical
rainforest in Africa. As mentioned in the article in Weekly Epidemiological
Record No.15 published 11 April 1997, the current measures undertaken to
interrupt disease transmission include education of health-care providers
and distribution of health messages, such as limiting contact with wild-
caught animals and restricting contact with suspected cases to a single
person (preferably the oldest member of the household who has either
recovered from monkeypox or has a "vaccinia" vaccination scar). Further WHO
studies are planned in the region to determine the need for additional
risk-reduction measures.
