The Ministry of Health this Friday, 15 [May 2015] announced that Zika virus is circulating in the country. The Instituto Evandro Chagas [national virus reference laboratory] stated that tests for 16 people gave preliminary results for the [Zika] virus. There are 8 [positive] samples from Bahia and 8 from Rio Grande do Norte. The Ministry is following the situation and participating in the investigation of other suspected cases of diseases with rash to define the causal agents and adopt complementary measures for surveillance, prevention and control in the country.

According to studies, just 18 per cent of people with Zika [virus infections] present with clinical manifestations of the disease. Its evolution is benign, with an incubation period of about 4 days. The diseases characterized by low fever, conjunctival hyperemia (red eyes) without secretions, and without itching, arthralgia (joint pain) and macular-papular rash (skin eruptions with white or red spots) muscle and back pain. Signs and symptoms can last for 7 days.

The majority of cases [infections] do not present with signs or symptoms and no mortality is associated [with the infection]. The virus is transmitted by bite of _Aedes aegypti_, the same mosquito that transmits dengue [and chikungunya viruses]. Because of this, the preventive and control measures are the same as those adopted for dengue and chikungunya.

Treatment is symptomatic and based on the use of acetaminophen (paracetamol) for fever and pain, following medical advice. The use of salicylic acid [aspirin] and anti-inflammatory drugs is contraindicated due to the risk of hemorrhagic complications, as occurs with dengue. Guidance is to seek medical care for adequate attention.

Independent of confirmation of [results from] other sample for Zika virus [testing], it is important for health professionals to remain alert when dealing with suspected dengue cases in the health units and follow the current recommendations for clinical management per the standing protocols

[According to the Ministry's previous communication, official Ministry confirmation would occur only after a report is issued from a reference laboratory (see archive listed below). That report has now been issued from the Evando Chagas Institute reference laboratory, indicating positive laboratory tests for Zika virus infection. Although the Ministry indicated that the tests were preliminary, the Ministry clearly accepts them as confirmation that the virus is present in the country. Clinicians in the health centers in the affected area, and beyond, face a real dilemma. Dengue, chikungunya and Zika virus infections often present with symptoms similar enough to each other that a differential diagnosis will require laboratory testing to be certain of the etiological agent involved. Epidemiology units responsible for tracking infections produced by these 3 viruses face a challenge as well. Can they rely on reports from the field when the case numbers are not supported by laboratory tests? Meanwhile, chikungunya -- and doubtless Zika -- viruses unfortunately will continue to march across the country and sooner or later spill over into neighboring countries.
