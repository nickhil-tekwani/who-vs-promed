More than 50 cases of typhoid reported in Tajikistan
----------------------------------------------------
More than 50 people including 40 children have contracted typhoid fever in
southwestern Tajikistan and have been hospitalized, a health ministry
officialreported. All the cases were recorded in the village of
Kolkhozabad, some 120 kilometers (70 miles) south of the capital Dushanbe,
the official told AFP, adding that a nearby pond may be contaminated.
More than 600 people including many children suffered from typhoid, a
potentially fatal infectious disease, in Oct and Nov 2003 in the central
Asian country of 6.3 million. That epidemic was blamed on a lack of water
treatment facilities.
In 1997 Tajikistan -- the poorest of the former Soviet republics -- was hit
by a major typhoid fever epidemic affecting some 17 000 people and claiming
dozens of lives.
