FEVER & BIRDWATCHING - SEYCHELLES, TANZANIA (9)
================================================
Subject: Re: PROMED-AHEAD-EDR: Fever & birdwatching
Re the differential diagnoses Sindbis fever and West Nile fever
offered to explain PUO after birdwatching in East Africa:

The patient experienced fever for 3 weeks or more. This is
inconsistent with uncomplicated infections due to a flavivirus or
alphavirus where fever lasts less than a week and only rarely for
longer. The other useful clincial characteristic of most alphavirus
and flavivirus infections producing non-CNS ilnesses (true of many
arboviruus infections) is that there is usually an accompanying
leukopenia during the acute febrile period.

In addition, the incubation period was atypically long for any
arboviral infection--it is inconceivable that an inoculum delivered by
a vector that established an inoculation-site infection would require
so many replication cycles (generally arboviral replication cycles are
less than 24 hours) to elicit symptoms.


The incubation period of most arboviral infections rarely exceeds
10-12 days. The disappearance of fever in alphavirus and flavivirus
infections is associated with appearance of neutralizing antibody; the
human immune response in normal individuals appears to efficiently
clear SIN and WNV viruses.
