Fighting Ebola: Could Sierra Leone have done better?
----------------------------------------------------
From all that we've heard so far from our health workers, politicians across West Africa and the UN World Health Organisation [WHO], we have to accept that Sierra Leone is firmly in the claws of the Ebola epidemic and it will take a struggle of herculean proportions to free ourselves.

We have lost and will lose many more of our people probably before I finish writing this piece. Victory against Ebola is not in sight. Without doubt, this is the most serious catastrophe Sierra Leone has had to confront since Foday Sankoh brought a band of wicked killers across from Liberia. We have a few more weeks, even months to go, assuming we intensify the fight and are more honest and transparent with ourselves on this issue.

Inevitably, questions abound as to [why,] unlike Uganda, we have been unable to isolate, attack and defeat Ebola after so many weeks with all the international goodwill. In fact the latest figures released by the ministry of health clearly tell us the disease is spreading. The leadership of president Yoweri Museveni in his nation's struggle against Ebola, was internationally acclaimed. I think we are missing that vital convincing spark that this is a national emergency. In just a few weeks we have lost more than 100 innocent souls. What does it really have to take to drum the message home that merely making speeches, throwing money at the problem and engaging in mindless spin are totally counter-productive?

It's almost as if it's the rebel war mentality all over again. Until the rebels came to Freetown, many people dismissed the war as a matter for the uncivilised rural poor. Since independence, we have allowed many of our rural communities to be isolated and remote -- even cut off from the rest of the country -- to the extent that a study done by one international agency in the days of Valentine Strasser, recorded people in some parts of Koinadugu district as saying that Siaka Stevens was still the president of Sierra Leone. The people are physically and emotionally cut off from whatever we are doing in Freetown. All they know is that every 5 years politicians would go around, and make promises to get them to vote for them. That's all.

People living in border communities of Sierra Leone are heavily influenced by their interaction with people on the other side. My village lies just a few miles from Sierra Leone's border with Liberia. The whole chiefdom uses Liberian money, they talk with a Liberian accent and send their children to school in Liberia. I am not comfortable with that, but I can understand why it's happening. It's about the proximity of Monrovia to that border, it's about trade, travel, inter-marriage and all that.

Let's confront this other issue head on: our health care system is just not robust and sophisticated [enough] to withstand the challenges of a modern health system. Yes, the free health care project achieved certain important results, just the fact that for once many pregnant and lactating women who would otherwise have never seen a doctor are now able to visit health centres is a great achievement. But it appears as if while we were busy celebrating free health gains in Freetown, other areas of the health sector were experiencing a chronic lack of investment leading to decay. So when ebolavirus attacked, the system in those abandoned parts of the country collapsed like a pack of cards.

[The author is not blaming Liberia for Ebola virus disease, but explaining the stronger influence of tribal culture in the borderlands over national citizenship. His comment on the dilapidated state of the health system in the interior of Sierra Leone explains a major part of the problem.

[2] Sierra Leone: tourism affected

The Sierra Leone Minister of Tourism and Cultural Affairs Hon. Peter Bayuku Konteh on Thursday, 17 Jul 2014, during the Government weekly press briefing called on journalists to be responsible and objective in the way they report the Ebola virus disease [EVD] outbreak. According to him, it is scaring, frightening and sending away tourists. He said, in as much as the EVD outbreak is scary and detrimental, media practitioners should know the way they do their reporting so as not to send away tourists, adding that the outbreak is not in any way helping the country but militating against the growth and developmental initiatives of the country through the government.

He said the tourism sector is one of the most valuable and sustainable sectors in the country. "The tourism sector is the most fragile in governance, so it must be cautiously handled so to enable it actualize its mandate by attracting tourists into the country that will contribute to national development."

He informed that, from January to June 2013 there were 41 820 guests who arrived into the country and a total of USD 30 182 000) was generated, whilst from January to June 2014, there were 32 944 guests who arrived in the country and generated the total sum of USD 23 944 000), which, according to him, is appalling and does not tell well for the country, as there are variances of 8 876 guests and a deficit of USD 6 000 579).

Also making a statement, Mr. Tony Shallop of Country Lodge said every week there are cancellation of tourist bookings due to the Ebola outbreak, which he stated is as a result of the way it is been reported by the media.

Funding shortfalls are limiting WHO's ability to contain the ebolavirus. International health officials warned Thursday [17 Jul 2014] that recent budget cuts have impeded the ability of the World Health Organization to respond to the Ebola virus disease [EVD] outbreak that has killed [632] people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

"The situation in West Africa should be a wake-up call to recognize that this weakening of this institution on which we all depend is not in anybody's interest," Scott Dowell, director of disease detection and emergency response at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], said during a briefing in Washington [DC, USA]. "In my view, there's no way that WHO can respond in a way that we need it to."

Partly because of declining donations from member countries during the global recession, the United Nations-backed WHO has suffered a 12 percent drop in its program budget in the last 2 years. This year's [2014] budget is USD 3.98 billion.

Efforts to address the deadliest outbreak of EVD in 40 years also have been hindered by the failure of some countries to implement the WHO's International Health Regulations, which went into effect in 2007, Dowell said. The regulations require countries to report outbreaks of certain diseases, including smallpox, polio and new strains of influenza, to the organization. "We saw spread and chaos ... and, frankly, a lack of strong leadership combined with very poor public health infrastructure in the area," Dowell said. Such poor management led to the resurgence of the virus, he said. "If there are poor areas of the world where pathogens can get a head start, we're all vulnerable," Scott Dowell said.

About 80 percent of UN member countries, including the United States [WHO's biggest contributor], have not met their public health policy obligations to the organization. Many countries could take years to develop the ability to survey disease outbreaks, including monitoring who is traveling into the country and developing a laboratory that can track pathogens nationwide, said Keiji Fukuda, WHO assistant director general for health security. In the meantime, they will need technical assistance from wealthier countries, he said.

Fukuda also expressed concern about his organization's ability to respond to simultaneous, multiple outbreaks around the world. "I think the answer is fairly clear," Fukuda said. "I don't think we're quite ready. We're not adequately set up or prepared to deal with those things."

[As an example of WHO's constraints, it is not sending its own consultants to the ebolavirus diagnostic labs in the 3 countries. It is asking the European mobile lab to hire personnel, and Public Health Canada to send theirs.
