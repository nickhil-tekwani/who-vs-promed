[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 1 699 661 with 81 953 (4.8%) cases reported by China. There are now a total of 1 617 708 confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported from 213 countries/locations outside mainland China, representing an increase of 95 895 cases when compared with the data on 9 Apr 2020, with the USA accounting for 34 310 (35.8%), the UK for 8681 (9.1%), France for 7120 (7.4%), Spain for 5051 (5.3%), Turkey for 4747 (5.0%), and Italy for 3951 (4.1%) of the newly confirmed cases. The total number of confirmed cases reported from outside China now represents 95.2% of the total number of reported cases. The epicenter has shifted outside of China to Western Europe and the USA. The USA now represents 35.8% of the global cases of COVID-19. The USA, Spain, Italy, Germany, and France, have overtaken China in total numbers of cases. A global total of 102 737 deaths have been reported, 99 398 (96.8%) outside mainland China.

It is now clear that while China has the largest population in the world and was the original location where the COVID-19 outbreak started, it has markedly reduced transmission to a manageable level, now monitoring all arrivals in the country from outside. South Korea has slowly decreased daily, new case counts hovering around or below 50 in recent days. The USA is now number one outside China for numbers of confirmed cases of COVID-19, Spain is number 2 and Italy is number 3. Iran has slowed down in growth rate and Turkey and the UK have been accelerating. - Mod.MPP]

[3] Italy: restrictive measures extended to 3 May 2020
Date: Fri 10 Apr 2020
Source: Italian Government COVID-19 website [In Italian, machine trans, edited]
http://www.salute.gov.it/portale/news/p3_2_1_1_1.jsp?lingua=italiano&menu=notizie&p=dalministero&id=4447


At the press conference today, [10 Apr 2020], Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte confirmed that he had prepared a new Decree of the President of the Council of Ministers [DPCM] to extend the restrictive measures until [3 May 2020].

"A difficult decision -- said President Giuseppe Conte -- but a necessary decision, for which I take responsibility after confronting the Scientific Technical Committee. The results of the epidemiological curve are encouraging and this confirms that the restrictive measures are working, but we cannot give in now, we risk losing the results achieved so far."

The President of the Council of Ministers recommended to keep the threshold of attention high even on these holidays, for Easter as for the long weekends of [25 Apr 2020] and [1 May 2020].

Libraries, stationery stores, and shops for babies and children reopen
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The extension foreseen by the DPCM, just signed, also applies to production activities. The intention is to loosen the measures to restart economic activities as soon as possible, but the conditions are not yet in place for this to be possible.

Compared to the previous restrictive measures relating to commercial activities, in the Prime Ministerial Decree there are some small variations, which concern partial re-openings. In particular, they will reopen from [14 Apr 2020], always in compliance with the indications of social distancing: bookstores, stationers, baby and children's shops, forestry, that is, the cutting of the woods necessary for the supply of fuels, and other forestry activities.

Phase 2
-------
Giuseppe Conte then recalled that "the government is already working to plan phase 2, we cannot wait for the virus to disappear from our country. The program -- said Conte -- rests on 2 pillars: the establishment of a working group of experts and the protocol for safety in the workplace."

The group of experts will be chaired by Vittorio Colao and will be made up of different professionals, selected from among the Italian excellences. The group of experts will cooperate with the Scientific Technical Committee to design a new organizational model.

The 2nd pillar is the strengthening of the Protocol for safety in the workplace, already signed on [14 Mar 2020].

[4] Obesity as risk factor for severe disease

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Letter to the Editor:
Risk factors for infectious disease severity are determined by the pathogen, host and environment [1]. COVID-19 disease, caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection includes a spectrum of illness; from asymptomatic infection [2] to severe pneumonia characterized by acute respiratory injury in about 20% of patients presenting to medical care [3]. The risk factors associated with disease severity, included increased age, diabetes, immune suppression and organ failure [3]. Recognition of risk factors for morbidity and mortality is important to determine prevention strategies as well as to target high-risk populations for potential therapeutics.

We performed a retrospective analysis of BMI [body mass index] stratified by age in COVID-19-positive symptomatic patients who presented to a large academic hospital system in New York City. Patients presented to the ED [emergency department] with signs of respiratory distress were admitted to the hospital. Critical care was defined based on intensive care accommodation status or invasive ventilator documentation in our electronic health record. Patients who were PCR-positive for COVID-19 during [4 Mar-4 Apr 2020] were extracted from our electronic health record system and analyzed with a chi-square Wald test using SAS v9.4 (SAS Institute, Care NC).

Of the 3615 individuals who tested positive for COVID-19, 775 (21%) had a body mass index (BMI) 30-34, and 595 (16% of the total cohort) had a BMI of 35 or higher. There were 1853 (51%) patients discharged from the ED, 1331 (37%) were admitted to the hospital in acute care, and 431 (12%) were either directly admitted or transferred to the ICU during admission. During analysis we found significant difference in admission and ICU care only in patients younger than 60 years of age with varying BMIs (Table 1).

Patients younger than 60 years with a BMI between 30-34 were 2.0 (95% 1.6-2.6, p less than 0.0001) and 1.8 (95% CI 1.2-2.7, p=0.006) times more likely to be admitted to acute and critical care, respectively, compared to individuals with a BMI lower than 30 (table 1) Likewise, patients with a BMI of 35 or higher and younger than 60 years were 2.2 (95% CI 1.7-2.9, p less than 0.0001) and 3.6 (95% CI 2.5-5.3, p=less than 0.0001) times more likely to be admitted to acute and critical compared to patients in the same age category who had BMI lower than 30.

Though patients younger than 60 years are generally considered a lower risk group of COVID-19 disease severity, based on data from our institution, obesity appears to be a previously unrecognized risk factor for hospital admission and need for critical care. This has important and practical implications, where nearly 40% of adults in the US are obese with a BMI equal to or greater than 30 [4]. The BMI range of individuals in this study appears representative of the nation, as 36% of the patients have a BMI of 30 or higher. There is geographic variation in reported mortality, as South Korea, China, and Italy report case fatality rates of 0.8, 2.3, and 7.2, respectively [5] and regional risk factors such as prevalence of smoking, pollution, or aging population has been cited. Unfortunately, obesity in people younger than 60 years is a newly identified epidemiologic risk factor which may contribute to increased morbidity rates experienced in the US.

[Doing a PubMed search there have been several recent comments in the journal Obesity related to observed increased morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19 in obese individuals. These findings are intuitive as obesity is a recognized risk factor for severe disease outcomes in any age group, but it is nice to see strong statistical support for the observation.

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CET, 10 Apr 2020

Highlights
----------
- No new country/territory/area reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.

- Dr Bruce Aylward, Special Adviser to WHO's Director-General, speaking of his recent mission to Spain at a press briefing yesterday [9 Apr 2020], highlighted the need for countries to understand that the virus can overwhelm even the most robust health systems, resulting in the need to entirely reconfigure health sectors in response. Find more about Dr Aylward's recent fact-finding mission to Spain at http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/health-emergencies/coronavirus-covid-19/news/news/2020/4/reconfiguring-health-systems-vital-to-tackling-covid-19.

- OpenWHO, a web-based learning platform, has launched a new online course Introduction to Go.Data -- Field data collection, chains of transmission and contact follow-up. The Go.Data tool supports outbreak investigation, focusing on field data collection, contact tracing and visualisation of chains of transmission. It is available to WHO staff around the world, Member States and partners. For more information, please see https://openwho.org/courses/godata-en.

- As the number of cases continues to climb in Europe, 2 new WHO tools launched today [10 Apr 2020] will help health planners in the European Region prepare for the rapidly increasing number of patients with COVID-19 requiring acute and intensive care in hospitals. For more details, please see http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/health-emergencies/coronavirus-covid-19/news/news/2020/4/new-who-tools-launched-to-help-hospitals-manage-surge-in-covid-19-patients.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside China now totals 210. This includes 18 countries (including 4 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 60 countries (including 7 territories) from the European region, 10 from the Southeast Asia region, 21 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 54 countries (including 18 territories) from the Americas region, and 47 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

The Americas region is reporting 38 463 new cases (in the past 24 hours) of which 80.2% were reported by the USA, followed by Brazil (5.7%), Peru (3.6%), and Canada (3.4%). Recognizing the USA data are overshadowing the regional proportions, without including the reported newly confirmed cases from the USA, Brazil reported 29.1% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Peru at 18.3%, Canada at 17.4%, and Ecuador at 6.8%.

The European region seems to be picking up again, having confirmed 40 035 (47.1% of the global newly reported cases) new cases and 4697 (64.5%) deaths in the 24 hours since the last WHO update, up from 39 442 new cases and 3877 new deaths from yesterday's update (9 Apr 2020). Spain reported 14.4% of newly confirmed cases, Germany 13.3%, the UK 10.9%, France 10.6%, Italy 10.5%, and Turkey 10.1%. These 6 countries (representing 10% of the European countries) account for 69.8% of newly confirmed cases in Europe.

In the Eastern Mediterranean region, Iran reported 1634 new cases representing 49.4% of the regional newly reported cases. Saudi Arabia, The United Arab Emirates (UAE), Pakistan, and Qatar, represent 10.7%, 10.0%, 8.4%, and 5.0% respectively. Removing Iran from the denominator, Saudi Arabia represents 21.2% of newly confirmed cases, followed by The UAE at 19.8%, Pakistan at 16.7%, and Qatar at 9.9%.

In the African region, Algeria reported 20.8% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by South Africa at 19.7%, Niger at 15.0, and Mauritius at 9.1%.

In the Western Pacific region, Japan reported 43.2% of the newly reported cases (outside of China), Singapore 21.4%, the Philippines 15.4%, and Malaysia 8.1%.

In South East Asia, 4 of the 10 countries reported no new cases in the previous 24 hours. Of the remaining countries, India reported 48.4% of newly reported cases, Indonesia 39.7%, and Bangladesh, 8.0%.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported outside of China, by date of report and WHO region through [10 Apr 2020], at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. One sees the contribution of the ongoing epidemics in Europe and now the increasing cases in the Americas region, fueled by the USA but other countries are following suit. The curve seems to show Europe increasing over the past few days, but the Americas are adding to the overall height of the curve on a daily basis. The 24-hour newly reported case total for the European region was 40 035 today (10 Apr 2020), compared with 38 463 for the Americas region.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: it is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4).

For the past 3 weeks, I have had help compiling all of the data presented in the tables and preparing spreadsheets, and want to publicly thank Coleman Schaefer for his amazing assistance -- a formidable task to say the least. - Mod.MPP]
