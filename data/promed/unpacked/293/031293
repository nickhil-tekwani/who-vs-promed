A tick bite led to amputations of all 4 of an Oklahoma woman's limbs. Doctors did it to save her life from the aggressive bacterium the bite had transmitted. It's the worst case of Rocky Mountain spotted fever they'd seen, the woman's cousin told CNN affiliate KOCO.

The intensity of this case may be rare, but infections unfortunately are not. Few people die from Rocky Mountain spotted fever anymore, since it can be treated with antimicrobials. But treatment should start in the 1st 5 days of infection. That time frame appears to have been missed in this case.

A tick carrying the rickettsial organism _Rickettsia rickettsii_ likely fed on the woman when she visited Grand Lake in north east Oklahoma during her vacation in July 2015. 4 days later, the woman thought she'd caught an severe flu. A day after that, she was in a hospital being tested for aggressive, life-threatening diseases like West Nile and meningitis. "She was shaking her hands because they hurt, her feet hurt," her cousin said. The patient went into septic shock, and her limbs turned black and blue.

Doctors amputated them below the knees and elbows in a series of operations, to try to keep the disease from spreading to other vital organs [actually more likely to be because of the development of overt gangrene from vasculitis and low blood pressure - Mod.LL].

Hundreds of people contract the disease each year, the CDC says. And the rate of infection is 3 to 10 times the national average in 5 states -- Oklahoma among them. Summer is high season for infections due to tick activity. Not every tick bite leads to the disease. Only 1 per cent to 3 per cent of ticks carry the bacteria called _Rickettsia rickettsii_, according to Oklahoma's health department, and to transmit it, the host tick usually has to feed for a number of hours.

[It is vital to diagnose rickettsial infection promptly to minimize morbidity and mortality. In states such as Pennsylvania, where the disease is less endemic than the Middle Atlantic states, it is particularly important to think of this infection.

When the female tick harboring the organism attaches to a passing human, she usually starts low on the body after transferring from grassy vegetation or even directly or indirectly from a dog. After crawling around on clothes seeking an appropriate cutaneous site (wearing white clothes makes a wandering tick easier to spot), she attaches and begins to feed.

If not already partially fed, after attaching, it generally takes 24 hours to activate and transmit the rickettsial organism. For this reason, daily or twice-daily tick checks with removal will minimize disease transmission. Ticks that attach in hairy areas such as the scalp or beard may be more difficult to find.

The incubation period of the disease is about a week after the tick exposure, long after the tick has detached. The presenting illness is generally nonspecific, fever, muscle pains, headache (but the headache is usually described as quite severe). The rash begins on day 3 of the illness, initially maculopapular at the wrists and ankles before becoming petechial and purpuric, involving the palms and soles as well as spreading proximally to the trunk. Purpura usually are not seen before the 6th day of illness. The mortality is indeed quite low if treatment (usually a tetracycline) is begun during the 1st 2 days of the rash or before.

Empiric treatment for this infection should always be begun in people with compatible symptoms inhabiting endemic areas during the spring and summer, even if no tick bite is known.
