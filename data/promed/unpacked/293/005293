The Center for Food Safety (CFS) of Hong Kong announced on Friday [20 Oct
2006] that test results of 22 raw oyster samples previously collected from
a food supplier and 4 food premises showed no presence of pathogens. A
spokesman for the center said that in investigating suspected food
poisoning cases, the CFS would take into account a number of factors and
take appropriate actions as the situation warranted. The factors include
clinical and epidemiological data, hygiene condition of the food premises,
sources and distribution of food concerned, and test results of food samples.
"From 26 Sep to 10 Oct 2006, 8 reports [of] suspected food poisoning cases
in 4 food premises were received. Investigations into the clinical and food
history of the patients revealed that the cases might be related to
consumption of raw oysters. The stool sample of one of the patients was
tested positive for norovirus. This virus usually exists in raw oysters,"
the spokesman said.
As to the source of oysters in question, the CFS is following it up with
the Chilean Consulate General as the supplier claimed that the oysters
concerned were frozen half-shells imported from Chile. CFS is also awaiting
information from the supplier to confirm the source.
"The center will continue to take effective food safety control measures to
protect public health," he said. There were frequent food poisoning cases
related to eating raw oysters found in Hong Kong recently. A total of 87
relational cases happened, involving 349 people hitherto in 2006.

[This report implicates norovirus infection as a possible cause of illness
in a recent outbreak of gastroenteritis associated with consumption of raw
oysters in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China.
Gastroenteritis associated with consumption of raw oysters is common
throughout the world and this culinary practice should be regarded as
unwise. Fortunately, illness as a consequence of norovirus infection,
although severe, is short-lived with no serious outcome.
Remarkably, the oysters responsible for this outbreak may have been
exported to Hong Kong from Chile. Previously oysters imported into Hong
Kong from both the Republic of Ireland and from Singapore (see ProMED-mail
references below) have been associated with outbreaks of gastroenteritis.
This global trade in oysters represents an unusual route for transmission
of enteric viruses and may be responsible for the frequent recurrence of
epidemics of shellfish-associated gastroenteritis, and a factor in the
short-lived immune response to enteric viruses such as noroviruses which
exhibit a degree of diversity. - Mod.CP]
