The public health service has temporarily closed the kitchen of the Doblemar Hotel, located on the Gran Via in La Manga del Mar Menor, after 63 guests were taken ill with food poisoning. Sources have since revealed that the outbreak was originally detected on 25 Jul 2021, but that more cases were reported in recent days and the kitchen was shut this week while the source of the contamination is investigated. While many of those affected have suffered only mild symptoms, such as nausea, fever or vomiting, as many as 20 of the guests have had to be admitted to hospital.

Food poisoning, or norovirus infection [this article does not clearly document that norovirus was the cause - Mod.LL], usually causes gastroenteritis, the commonest symptoms of which are stomach pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Most people develop symptoms 12 to 48 hours after contracting norovirus, and they can last up to 3 days. Contagion occurs by coming into direct contact with an infected person, by consuming intoxicated food or water and by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching the mouth with the hands. There is no specific drug against this virus, and doctors recommend drinking plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration.

A stomach virus, originating in the hotel kitchen, that affected the patrons of the Doblemar Hotel in La Manga del Mar Menor has now infected 79 people. Almost all are suffering from the effects of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, thought to be derived from a norovirus that has added 13 new casualties in recent days. The information was provided by Murcia's health minister, Juan Jose Pedreno, in an appearance this Monday [9 Aug 2021] following the COVID Committee meeting.

The virus itself "is not serious", said Pedreno, who added that the hotel kitchen remains closed. Although the majority of tourists affected by this food poisoning are only suffering from mild symptoms, some guests did have to be transferred to the hospital. The Ministry is in permanent contact with the hotel and is monitoring all new cases.

[A number of postings online refer to norovirus as the cause of the lingering outbreak related to the hotel kitchen, but it is not clear that this is the case. ProMED awaits more information regarding this outbreak. Many of those affected were Czech tourists (https://tn.nova.cz/clanek/hororova-dovolena-ve-spanelsku-u-skupiny-60-cechu-propukla-nakaza.html).

The 1st sign of norovirus is usually a sudden sick feeling, followed by forceful vomiting and watery diarrhea. Some people may also have a raised temperature (over 38 C/100.4 F), headaches, stomach cramps, and aching limbs. Symptoms usually appear 1 or 2 days after exposure to infection, but they can start sooner. Most people make a full recovery within a few days. Apart from the risk of dehydration, the illness is not generally dangerous, and there are usually no long-lasting effects from norovirus infection.

Norovirus infections can occur at any time of the year but happen most often during the winter months, hence its old name "winter vomiting disease." Norovirus activity can also be localized with increased activity in one area but not in others. Certainly, prominent focal summer activity has been reported in the past with this reference by Guadagnucci Morillo et al (1) as an example. Given the kind of isolation that has occurred related to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, winter-time infections with viruses such as norovirus and respiratory syncytial virus seem to be making their mark in the summer, as personal isolation procedures have been, at least temporarily, lifted.

La Manga, or La Manga del Mar Menor, is a seaside spit of Mar Menor in the region of Murcia, Spain. The strip is 21 km long and 100 meters wide, separating the Mediterranean Sea from the Mar Menor lagoon, from Cabo de Palos to the Punta del Mojon. The region in southwest Spain can be seen on a map at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region_of_Murcia.
