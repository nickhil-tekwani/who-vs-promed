Subject: Emergency Management Warning 5: Newcastle Disease in California in
Backyard Poultry
Newcastle Disease Confirmed in California
Officials with the California Department of Agriculture (CDFA) and the
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services (APHIS) are conducting an
eradication campaign for Newcastle disease. The disease was confirmed on 1
Oct 2002, and is restricted to backyard poultry. Clinical signs in
infected birds include respiratory, nervous, and gastrointestinal
signs. Mortality is up to 90 percent of exposed birds. Commercial
poultry, at this time, are not involved in the disease occurrence.
Investigations are on-going and all figures are pending final validation.
Situation Update:
Number of premises positive: 25
Number of contacts: 32
Number of premises quarantined: 147
Number of premises depopulated: 53
Premises waiting to be depopulated: 4
Birds depopulated to date: 9600 (approximate)
Counties with positive flocks: Los Angeles
Riverside
San Bernardino
Operational Update:
State and federal animal health officials are conducting door-to-door
surveys to identify fowl and other birds in the affected areas and are
following up on all epidemiologic associations. To date, depopulation,
cleaning and disinfecting, and carcass disposal are being conducted by CDFA
and APHIS. CDFA has closed all poultry exhibits and fairs and expositions
within the State of California.
The Newcastle disease situation is contained and is still considered a
single outbreak cluster within a 30-mile radius in Los Angeles County and
along the Los Angeles/Riverside/San Bernardino County border.
Affected and exposed backyard poultry are being euthanized, double-bagged,
disinfecting the bags, and transporting the carcasses to restricted
landfills for burial.
All door-to-door surveillance, along with interviews, has established that
there have been no links to eastern States within the United States and no
exposure to other backyard poultry in other States.
Local commercial table egg layer birds are being closely monitored and will
only be allowed to move intrastate under CDFA monitoring and spent-hen
movements restricted to the day they are scheduled for processing.
Trade Issues:
The Philippines has banned all live poultry and poultry products from the
State of California, retroactive back to 3 Oct 2002.
Guam has placed an embargo on all live poultry from the United
States. Under this action, both table eggs and hatching eggs are permitted
into Guam.

the United States.
Japan has banned all poultry and poultry products from a 50-kilometer
radius around the infected premises in California, for 3-months.
Taiwan has banned all shipments of fresh, chilled, frozen, and other
related poultry products produced or loaded in the State of California,
retroactive back to 3 Oct 2002. Poultry and poultry products transiting
California in sealed containers may be imported into Taiwan. The ban also
applies to dry pet food containing poultry. Canned pet foods and poultry
meat are permitted.
Canada has placed a ban on hatching eggs and live poultry from the entire
State of California.
Polish veterinary authorities have banned imports of poultry meat from the
State of California.

disease occurrence premises;
2. Poultry meat is banned for 2 months. 28 Nov 2002 would be the date the
banned area would be eligible again to export to Korea; and
3. Live poultry, day-old chicks, hatching eggs, and edible eggs are banned
for 12 months.
Effective 1 Oct 2002, the European Union has placed a ban on the entire
United States for the following commodities:
1. Live poultry and hatching eggs;
2. Live ratites and hatching eggs;
3. Fresh poultry meat;
4. Fresh meat and farmed or wild game birds; and
5. Fresh ratite meat.
Please forward this information to your federal, State, and
