[1] Herd immunity
Date: Tue 3 Aug 2021
Source: Bloomberg [edited]
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-03/delta-s-spread-seen-pushing-herd-immunity-threshold-above-80


The spread of the delta coronavirus variant has pushed the threshold for herd immunity to well over 80% and potentially approaching 90%, according to an Infectious Diseases Society of America briefing on Tue [3 Aug 2021]. That represents a "much higher" bar than previous estimates of 60% -- 70%, because delta is twice as transmissible, said Richard Franco, an assistant professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. "It is becoming clear that this is a very dangerous, way more dangerous virus than the original one," Franco said.

Herd immunity is based on the idea that when a certain percentage of the population has been vaccinated against the virus or gains immunity by a previous infection, it helps protect the broader population and reduce transmission. Nearly 60% of Americans have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, and about 50% have been fully vaccinated, representing about 165 million individuals, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Some 35 million people in the United States, meanwhile, have tested positive for the virus over the course of the pandemic.

[The problems with estimating what level of population immunity would create herd immunity are the extent to which vaccinated individuals may become infected and transmit the virus, and the evolution of new variants that may evade antibody stimulated by the vaccine even more efficiently than the delta variant does. With the vaccines currently being administered, it may be possible that we will never achieve herd immunity. - Mod.LK]

[2] Children: long COVID

Adding to the small body of research about long COVID in kids, scientists in the United Kingdom report that the vast majority of children recover from their infections 2 months after testing positive, but the number with persistent symptoms is not zero. Based on answers entered via a smartphone app by parents of more than 1700 patients, the study says a little more than 4% of children still felt symptoms -- fatigue was the commonest, followed by headache and loss of taste and smell -- after 4 weeks and just under 2% had lingering problems after 8 weeks. Consistent with previous case reports, adolescents were more likely to report long-lasting symptoms. A caveat: conducting the study via smartphone could limit the population its results reflect.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
Background
In children, SARS-CoV-2 infection is usually asymptomatic or causes a mild illness of short duration. Persistent illness has been reported; however, its prevalence and characteristics are unclear. We aimed to determine illness duration and characteristics in symptomatic UK school-aged children tested for SARS-CoV-2 using data from the COVID Symptom Study, one of the largest UK citizen participatory epidemiological studies to date.

Methods
In this prospective cohort study, data from UK school-aged children (age 5-17 years) were reported by an adult proxy. Participants were voluntary, and used a mobile application (app) launched jointly by Zoe Limited and King's College London. Illness duration and symptom prevalence, duration, and burden were analysed for children testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 for whom illness duration could be determined, and were assessed overall and for younger (age 5-11 years) and older (age 12-17 years) groups. Children with longer than 1 week between symptomatic reports on the app were excluded from analysis. Data from symptomatic children testing negative for SARS-CoV-2, matched 1:1 for age, gender, and week of testing, were also assessed.

Findings
258 790 children aged 5-17 years were reported by an adult proxy between 24 Mar 2020, and 22 Feb 2021, of whom 75 529 had valid test results for SARS-CoV-2. 1734 children (588 younger and 1146 older children) had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result and calculable illness duration within the study timeframe (illness onset between 1 Sep 2021, and 24 Jan 2021). The most common symptoms were headache (1079 [62.2%] of 1734 children), and fatigue (954 [55.0%] of 1734 children). Median illness duration was 6 days (interquartile range [IQR] 3-11) versus 3 days (2-7) in children testing negative, and was positively associated with age (Spearman's rank-order rho 0.19, p<0.0001). Median illness duration was longer for older children (7 days, IQR 3-12) than younger children (5 days, 2-9). 77 (4.4%) of 1734 children had illness duration of at least 28 days, more commonly in older than younger children (59 [5.1%] of 1146 older children vs 18 [3.1%] of 588 younger children; p=0.046). The commonest symptoms experienced by these children during the first 4 weeks of illness were fatigue (65 [84.4%] of 77), headache (60 [77.9%] of 77), and anosmia (60 [77.9%] of 77); however, after day 28 the symptom burden was low (median 2 symptoms, IQR 1-4) compared with the first week of illness (median 6 symptoms, 4-8). Only 25 (1.8%) of 1379 children experienced symptoms for at least 56 days. Few children (15 children, 0.9%) in the negatively tested cohort had symptoms for at least 28 days; however, these children experienced greater symptom burden throughout their illness (9 symptoms, IQR 7.7-11.0 vs 8, 6-9) and after day 28 (5 symptoms, IQR 1.5-6.5 vs 2, 1-4) than did children who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.

Interpretation
Although COVID-19 in children is usually of short duration with low symptom burden, some children with COVID-19 experience prolonged illness duration. Reassuringly, symptom burden in these children did not increase with time, and most recovered by day 56. Some children who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 also had persistent and burdensome illness. A holistic approach for all children with persistent illness during the pandemic is appropriate. - Mod.LK]

[3] Flu vaccine benefit

[ref: Taghioff SM, Slavin BR, Holton T, et al. Examining the potential benefits of the influenza vaccine against SARS-CoV-2: A retrospective cohort analysis of 74 754 patients. PLoS One. 2021 Aug 3; 16(8): e0255541. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255541]

COVID-19 patients who had received the flu vaccine 6 months-2 weeks prior to diagnosis were less likely to have sepsis, stroke, and--with some time constraints--deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) or emergency department (ED), according to a study yesterday [Tue 3 Aug 2021] in PLoS One.

The researchers used an electronic medical record network to match 37 377 COVID-19 patients who had received the flu vaccine with 37 377 of those who hadn't in January 2021, drawing from 56 healthcare organizations predominantly in the United States. Across 30, 60, 90, and 120 days after being diagnosed as having COVID-19, those who received the flu vaccine had lower occurrences of sepsis (risk ratio [RR], 1.36-1.45), stroke (RR, 1.45-1.58), and, for almost all time points, less likely to go to the ICU (RR, 1.17-1.20 for 30, 90, and 120 days, with day 60 approaching significance at 1.16).

From days 60-120, patients who had the flu vaccine also showed significantly less likelihood for DVTs (RR, 1.41 to 1.53) and, from days 90-120, significantly less likelihood of visiting the ED (RR, 1.20-1.58). Similar to previous studies, the researchers did not find any significance with mortality rates.

"In addition to guarding against a possible 'twindemic' of simultaneous outbreaks of influenza and SARS-CoV-2, the [number needed to vaccinate] trends observed within 30-120 days of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis for sepsis, stroke, ICU admission, DVT, and ED visits further strengthen the case in favor of a protective effect of influenza vaccination," write the researchers.

[The potential mechanisms for the protective effects of the flu vaccine on COVID-19 are discussed in the PLoS One paper cited above -- see paper for references -- and shown here:
"...Recently, several studies have suggested a possible protective effect of the influenza vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 (9-12). Although no cross-reactivity between influenza-induced antibodies and SARS-CoV-2 protection has been demonstrated, several theorized mechanisms of the potential protective effect of influenza vaccination have been proposed in the recent literature (9,13,14). The first hypothesis centers around the presence of MF59 in the influenza vaccine: an oil-in-water squalene emulsion that has been shown to assist in potentiating an immune response to SARS-CoV variants (14). Alternatively, influenza vaccination's potential protective effect may be explained by its ability to stimulate the activation of natural killer cells, the levels of which have been found to be considerably decreased in moderate and severe SARS-CoV-2 cases (15,16). Another proposed mechanism was described in a recent case-control study of 261 healthcare workers. The authors noted several prior studies that suggested both coronaviruses and influenza viruses engage with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) and tetraspanin antibodies. Thus, there is belief that ACE-2 and tetraspanin antibodies may inhibit both coronavirus and low-pathogenic influenza A virus infections. Outcomes of this study pointed to a potential protective effect in those with influenza vaccination (11). Additional studies reported that the influenza vaccine may lead to decreased risk of cardiovascular events due to potential interaction with immune and inflammatory systems to promote plaque stabilization (17, 18). It has also been recently reported that influenza vaccine-induced antibodies may interact with the bradykinin 2 receptor, leading to an anti-inflammatory effect secondary to increasing nitric oxide (18,19)." - Mod.LK]
