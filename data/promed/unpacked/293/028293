The UK Health Protection Agency (HPA) is strongly urging caterers and
the public to wash and thoroughly cook raw bean sprouts before they
are eaten, unless they are clearly labeled as ready to eat. This
warning comes on the heels of the detection by a government lab of
_Salmonella_ in a sample of raw bean sprouts.

HPA has confirmed 106 cases of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype]
Bareilly infections in England (102 cases), Wales (3 cases) and
Northern Ireland (1 case). Health Protection Scotland has confirmed 19
cases, all of which are a genetic match for the 106 cases in England.
At least some of the outbreak victims, when interviewed, reported
having consumed bean sprouts. Genetic typing results for the
_Salmonella_ found in the sprouts will be available in a few days.

Bean sprouts, along with other seed sprouts, have a long history of
involvement in foodborne disease outbreaks. In 1973, 4 people fell ill
after eating raw bean sprouts that were produced using a
do-it-yourself kit. The sprouts, when cultured in the lab, produced a
pure culture of _Bacillus cereus_.

The most notorious sprout-related outbreaks took place in Japan in
1996 and 1997. In all, some 12 000 people, many of them school
children, were infected with _E. coli_ O157:H7 after consuming
contaminated radish sprouts. 12 people died. The sprouts were produced
from radish seeds imported into Japan from the USA.

Raw alfalfa, soybean, radish, clover and mung bean sprouts all have
been implicated in foodborne outbreaks since 1973, most often due to
_E. coli_ O157:H7 or _Salmonella_. In May 2010, alfalfa sprouts
produced by Caldwell Fresh Foods (Maywood, California) were the source
of an outbreak of _Salmonella_ Newport that caused 44 (lab-confirmed)
illnesses in 11 US states.

The UK Food Standards Agency has issued the following updated advice
for preparing and cooking bean sprouts:
- keep bean sprouts refrigerated
- avoid sprouts that have turned brown or have a strange odor
- rinse raw bean sprouts thoroughly
- follow any instructions on the packaging and use the bean sprouts
by the 'use by' dates
- bean sprouts that are labelled 'ready to eat' can be eaten
uncooked, as long as they are consumed within the 'use by' date
- bean sprouts not labelled 'ready to eat' should be cooked
thoroughly until they are piping hot all the way through
- if you are unsure whether the bean sprouts are 'ready to eat,' or
in the absence of clear preparation instructions, always cook the bean
sprouts thoroughly before eating. This includes bean sprouts that are
labelled or appear 'pre-washed,' but are not described as 'ready to
eat.'
