There is a cluster of Legionnaire's disease in Orillia, Ontario. A total of 19 cases of Legionnaires' disease have been discovered in people who reside in or have visited the City of Orillia in recent weeks. The Simcoe Muskoka District Health Unit (SMDHU) is currently investigating the outbreak, said Dr. Charles Gardner, medical officer of health for SMDHU.

"We have had these cases reported to us very recently, indicating the need to investigate and to take steps to reduce the risk of further transmission," said Gardner. "The health unit is looking for a source of the bacteria, and healthcare providers in the community are being notified to watch and test for potential cases."

Legionnaires' disease is a lung disease caused by _Legionella_ bacteria, which are commonly found in natural freshwater environments. However, it can become a health concern in water systems, such as cooling towers, plumbing systems in large buildings, humidifiers, hot tubs and spas and decorative fountains when conditions allow the bacteria to multiply.

This isn't the first time Orillia has had to deal with the lung disease. In 2019, 10 confirmed cases were discovered. Nine people recovered and one person died. It was later determined that cooling towers in downtown Orillia contained a strain of _Legionella_ bacteria that was identified in the cluster of cases.

People can develop Legionnaires' disease when they inhale aerosolized water droplets containing the bacteria. People cannot get Legionnaires' disease by drinking water, and it cannot be passed from person to person. Most people exposed to the bacteria do not become ill.

The health unit is working with community partners, including the City of Orillia, to help raise awareness, gather information and monitor the impacts of the cluster.

Legionnaires' disease is a type of pneumonia (lung infection) caused by bacteria. People over 50, smokers, or those with certain medical conditions, including weakened immune systems, chronic lung disease or other chronic health conditions, are at increased risk for Legionnaires' disease. Legionnaires' disease can be treated with antibiotics, and most cases resolve without long-term effects.

Common disease symptoms are fever, chills, cough and difficulty breathing. Other symptoms can also develop, such as headaches, muscle pain and digestive problems (e.g., loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea).

The health unit recommends that if you have been feeling ill and have respiratory symptoms, you should follow up with your healthcare provider or call Telehealth Ontario at 1-866-797-0000 or seek immediate medical attention. More information on Legionnaire's disease can be found on the health unit's website (https://www.simcoemuskokahealth.org/Topics/InfectiousDiseases/DiseaseInformation/FactSheetsIL/Legionellosis.aspx) or by calling Health Connection at 705-721-7520 or 1-877-721-7520, weekdays from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.

[Orillia (pop., 33 411 residents in 2021) is a city in Simcoe County, in a densely populated and industrialized region of Ontario, Canada (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simcoe_County), between Lake Couchiching and Lake Simcoe, about 87 mi (140 km) north of Toronto. A map showing the location of Orillia can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Orillia,+ON,+Canada.

Humans acquire Legionnaires' disease after exposure to natural or human-made aquatic reservoirs, usually by means of inhalation of aerosolized _Legionella_ bacteria, but the disease can also be acquired by aspiration of _Legionella_-contaminated potable water in people prone to aspirate, such as debilitated hospitalized patients. _Legionella_ infection can be acquired less commonly by contamination of wounds. Possible person-to-person transmission has also been described (Correia AM, Goncalves J, Gomes, JP, et al. Probable person-to-person transmission of Legionnaires' disease. N Engl J Med. 2016; 374: 497-8; http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356).

Water temperatures of 25-40 deg C (77-104 deg F) support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems. Aerosolization of the contaminated warm water can be generated by showerheads, spa pools and hot tubs, misting sprays in outdoor event spaces and in grocery departments, fountains, cooling towers, and car washes.

Aerosols can spread for distances outdoors, wafted in air currents downwind from their source. In fact, "Broad Street pneumonia" was described in passersby on Broad Street in front of a Philadelphia hotel, but who had never entered the hotel, where the 1976 Legionnaires' disease outbreak occurred during a Pennsylvania Legionnaires' convention (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00045731.htm).

Genotyping of clinical isolates of _Legionella_ can help identify a common source outbreak if the genotypes of clinical isolates match. Molecular typing of environmental isolates of _Legionella_ can help identify the source of the outbreak, if the environmental genotype matches the genotype of the clinical isolates.

In 2019, Orillia had 10 confirmed cases of Legionnaires' disease; 9 people recovered and one person died. See ProMED posts Legionellosis - Canada (05): (ON) comment 20191221.6852109, Legionellosis - Canada (04): (ON) RFI 20191214.6840544, and Legionellosis - Canada (02): (ON) 20191013.6724136. The 2019 outbreak was attributed to a contaminated cooling tower on the basis of genotyping the _Legionella_ strains isolated from patients in the outbreak and the cooling tower (https://barrie.ctvnews.ca/legionnaire-s-outbreak-in-orillia-declared-over-1.4694534).

More information on the current outbreak in Orillia from knowledgeable sources would be appreciated. - Mod.ML
