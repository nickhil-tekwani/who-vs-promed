Bluetongue virus in Western Mediterranean: RFI
--------------------------------------------
According to a DPA (Deutsche Presse Agentur) news release from 10 or 11 Oct
2000, more than 2000 sheep were euthanized on the Balearic Islands Mallorca
and Menorca (islands in the Western Mediterranean basin), possibly with
Bluetongue virus (BTV). I contacted DPA, but could not obtain more details
or their source of information.
Regarding BTV, I discussed with a Spanish colleague the possibility that
the biting midges that act as vector (_Culicoides imicola_) had been
carried to the Western Mediterranean by winds from Northern Africa. Or was
the unknown virus reservoir on one of these islands? How and in which
direction was the virus spread? This colleague confirmed the Balearic
cases in a private e-mail, but was not authorized to post the information
in ProMED-mail.
This BTV "puzzle" can only be solved when the scientific community gets
more detailed information about these new virus outbreaks.
