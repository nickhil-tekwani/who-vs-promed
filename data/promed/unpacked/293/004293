An outbreak of Q fever with multiple cases of pneumonia has occurred in Vokany [Baranya county] since 7 May 2013, which has drawn the attention of the County Government Office of Public Health. The District Institute of Public Health, in collaboration with the county health department, immediately began interviews and blood sampling of the hospitalized patients. In parallel, the government Directorate of Animal Health and Food Chain Safety also started to assess infection in sheep, goats, and cattle.

Based on an epidemiological investigation the Q fever outbreak currently involves 91 patients in the Vokany region and there are 22 people hospitalized in Pecs.

Patients should be treated for 2-3 weeks with doxycycline. Given the long incubation period of the infection, more cases may be expected. The source of infection is still unknown, although pathogen-infected aerosols that drifted for miles may have played a role. However, other factors must be considered.

[_Coxiella burnetii_, an obligate intracellular rickettsia-like bacterial pathogen causes Q fever. _C. burnetii_ is highly resistant to drying and heat, which is attributed to a small cell variant of the organism that is part of a biphasic developmental cycle. Q fever is a zoonosis. Domestic ungulates such as sheep, cattle, and goats serve as the reservoir of infection for humans. The organism is shed in urine, feces, milk, and especially birthing products; intermittent high-level shedding occurs at the time of parturition, with millions of bacteria being released per gram of placenta.

Humans usually become infected by inhaling aerosolized organisms. Acute symptoms of a flu-like illness with hepatitis or pneumonia usually develop within 2-3 weeks after exposure, although as many as half of humans infected with _C. burnetii_ do not show symptoms (http://www.cdc.gov/qfever/symptoms/index.html). Although most persons with acute Q fever recover, others may experience serious chronic illness within a few months or several years after acute infection, with complications that include endocarditis (especially in patients with previous cardiac valvulopathy), infected aneurysms or vascular prostheses, and chronic hepatitis.

Chronic infection can follow symptomatic or asymptomatic infection. Endocarditis is the most common form of chronic disease and is fatal if untreated. Its diagnosis is difficult because routine blood cultures are negative and vegetative lesions are too small to be readily visualized by echocardiography. Pregnant women who are infected may be at risk for pre-term delivery or miscarriage, and are at high risk for developing chronic Q fever. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment (such as with doxycycline) of acute infection shortens the illness and reduces the risk for severe complications. No licensed vaccine is available in the United States.

Q fever occurs worldwide with the exception of New Zealand. Q fever is primarily an occupational hazard for farmers, veterinarians, and abattoir workers in contact with infected domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, and goats and for laboratory personnel performing _C. burnetii_ cultures and working with _C. burnetii_-infected animals (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC88923/). Sporadic cases can also occur in people living in urban areas that are downstream from farms or abattoirs where the organisms have become aerosolized. Occasional cases follow contact with farm animals or after contact with infected pets such as dogs and cats. The largest known reported Q fever outbreak that involved approximately 4000 human cases occurred during 2007-2010 in the Netherlands and was linked to dairy goat farms near densely populated areas. (See prior ProMED-mail posts of the Netherlands outbreak below).

The acute and chronic stages of infection correspond to 2 distinct antigenic phases of antibody response. During an acute infection, an antibody response to _C. burnetii_ phase II antigen is predominant and is higher than the response to the phase I antigen, whereas chronic infection is associated with a rising phase I immunoglobulin G (IgG) titer.

The CDC has recently issued recommendations for the recognition, clinical and laboratory diagnosis, treatment, and management of Q fever (Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Diagnosis and Management of Q Fever -- United States, 2013: Recommendations from CDC and the Q Fever Working Group. Recommendations and Reports. 29 Mar 2013/62(RR03); 1-23. Available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6203a1.htm).

Vokany is a small village in Baranya County near the city of Pecs (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vokány). Pecs, with a population of 156 801 in 2012, is the 5th largest city in Hungary, located in an agricultural region, close to the border with Croatia. It is the administrative center of Baranya County (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pécs#Economy). A map of this region of Hungary can be found at http://goo.gl/maps/sWqQ8. - Mod.ML
