Survey on potato bacteria in Estonia: first report of _Clavibacter
michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_ and absence of _Ralstonia solanacearum_
------------------------
In 2000, the Estonian Plant Production Inspectorate started a systematic
survey for _Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_ (Cms) and
_Ralstonia solanacearum_ (Rs), both [of which are EPPO A2 quarantine pests.
Samples (2000 potato harvest) were tested by IF [immunofluorescence? -
Mod.SH at the Plant Health Laboratory and [the results are the following:
seed potato production: 78 samples tested, no Rs and ... no Cms found. Ware
potato production: 73 samples tested, Cms found in 9 samples [but no Rs
found. Imported potatoes: all consignments of seed potatoes and most
consignments of ware potatoes were tested in the laboratory. No Rs or Cms
found.
The EPPO Secretariat had no data previously on the presence of Cms in
Estonia. ... NPPO-Estonia stated that phytosanitary measures in accordance
with European Union directive 93/85/EEC are being applied in order to
prevent further spread of Cms and to eradicate the disease. The situation
with regard to the 2 bacteria in Estonia can be summarised as follows: Cms:
present: limited distribution; Rs: absent: confirmed by survey.

[The findings are not surprising and should form the basis for continuing
surveys. It is encouraging that neither pathogen was detected in samples
from surveys of seed farms. - Mod.DH
