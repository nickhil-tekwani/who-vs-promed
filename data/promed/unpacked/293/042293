State Veterinarian Michael J. Neault has announced South Carolina's 1st case this year [2021] of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE).

The 18-year-old gelding was from Sumter County, said Neault, who directs Clemson University's Livestock Poultry Health [LPH] unit. The animal's vaccination status was unknown, and he was euthanized due to his deteriorating condition.

The National Veterinary Services Laboratories confirmed the diagnosis on Friday afternoon [3 Sep 2021].

Neault reminded horse owners to work with their veterinarian to create an appropriate vaccination schedule to protect their animals from EEE, West Nile virus (WNV), and rabies. Borne by mosquitoes, these diseases have a very high mortality rate in infected, unvaccinated horses: between 30% and 40% for West Nile and 90% for EEE. However, widespread vaccination has kept the number of cases comparatively low in South Carolina compared to nearby states.

Likewise, mosquito control is an important precaution. Both EEE and West Nile viruses are maintained in nature through a cycle involving the freshwater swamp mosquito, _Culiseta melanura_, commonly known as the black-tailed mosquito.

The EEE and WNV viruses are mosquito-borne and fast-acting. Signs of EEE in horses usually develop from 2 to 5 days after exposure. The signs include stumbling, circling, head pressing, depression or apprehension, weakness of legs, partial paralysis, the inability to stand, muscle twitching, or death.

In addition to EEE and WNV, other neurologic diseases, including rabies and EHV-1, can infect horses. Any livestock displaying neurologic signs -- stumbling, circling, head pressing, depression, or apprehension -- must be reported to the state veterinarian within 48 hours, according to state law.

A list of reportable diseases, along with other resources, is published on the LPH website at https://www.clemson.edu/public/lph/ahp/reportable-diseases.

A horse in Colleton County has tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), a viral illness causing inflammation of the brain. The horse is the 2nd to test positive for the virus in South Carolina so far this year [2021], according to the state's lead health agency.

Officials with the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control say certain birds are reservoirs for this virus, and mosquitoes feeding on these birds can carry the virus to people and other animals.

Colleton County Animal Services says owners should protect their horses by providing the proper vaccines. "Last year [2020], 2 horses were euthanized because of EEE. We now have our 1st case in Colleton County this year [2021]," they said.

"Horse owners are encouraged to practice preventive care for their horses as related to arbovirus diseases, as cases can be prevented through effective vaccination and mosquito management strategies," DHEC said.

Researchers say signs often develop anywhere between 2 and 5 days after exposure.

Clemson Veterinary Diagnostic Center currently provides testing for EEE and WNV at no charge, thanks to an agreement with the S.C. Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC).

A horse has tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), reports the Shawano-Menominee Counties Health Department.

According to a release, this is the 1st confirmed case of EEE found in a horse in Shawano County and the 5th case in horses reported in the state this year [2021]. Calumet County confirmed their 1st case in August [2021].

So far, health officials say there are no EEE cases reported to be in humans this year [2021]; however, they do report there were 2 humans infected in 2020.

How can you get infected?
Health officials say the virus is spread to humans, horses, and other animals through an infected mosquito bite.

How does this happen? A mosquito will become infected with EEE if it feeds on an infected bird. Officials stress this virus does not get infected from human to horse, horse to another animal, etc. It gets transferred through a 3rd party, a mosquito.

This positive case means there are mosquitos in Shawano County that could be carrying the EEE virus.

Will you get sick?
Health officials explain many people do not get sick when they are infected with the virus.

They do report when people do get sick, they develop a fever, headache, chills, and vomiting. The illness may become severe, though. If it does, health officials say it will result in encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), disorientation, seizures, coma, or death.

Currently, there are no vaccines or treatments for EEE available for people.

Signs of EEE in a horse
The following are a few signs you can look for that may indicate your horse has EEE:
- depression
- loss of appetite
- drooping eyelids and lower lip
- blindness
- paralysis
- death

There is a vaccine for horses that owners can get to protect them from becoming ill.

How to protect from mosquito bites
Officials say you should try to mosquito-proof your home and avoid bites by doing the following:
- Apply an insect repellent with DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, or IR3535 to exposed skin and clothing.
- Treat clothing with permethrin; do not apply permethrin directly to the skin before going outside.
- Wear long sleeves, long pants, and socks when outdoors to help keep mosquitoes away from your skin.
- Remove stagnant water from items around your property, such as tin cans, plastic containers, flowerpots, discarded tires, roof gutters, and downspouts to prevent mosquitoes from breeding around your home.
- Change the water in bird baths and pet dishes at least [every day].
- Trim or mow tall grass, weeds, and vines since mosquitoes use these areas to rest during hot daylight hours.

2 horses in Minnesota were euthanized after they were found to be suffering from different equine diseases.

According to the Minnesota Board of Animal Health, a horse in Itasca County was confirmed to have eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), which is spread by mosquitoes.

A horse in Washington County, meanwhile, was confirmed to have equine herpesvirus, which is spread between horses. [Please see ProMED posting on equine herpesvirus, archive 20210923.8695753). - Mod.TG]

Both horses were euthanized after their conditions deteriorated in recent weeks.

"How the diseases are spread, how they're prevented, and how we respond to them are different. Because of the varied threat to the health of your horse, we strongly encourage routine checkups with your veterinarian," Dr. Brian Hoefs, senior veterinarian of the Board's Equine Program, said in a statement.

The Itasca horse was the 1st documented case of eastern equine encephalitis this year [2021]. It began suffering muscle loss before tests confirmed the diagnosis. It was euthanized on 16 Aug [2021].

Eastern equine encephalitis can be fatal in both humans and horses. In its announcement, the Board of Animal Health emphasized the importance of the EEE vaccine for horses.

The horse had attended 3 different shows in the area in August [2021]. The Board of Animal Health has reached out to those locations to alert attendees.

A little more than a month after mosquitoes carrying the potentially deadly eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus were discovered in Oswego County for the 1st time this year [2021], a pair of horses have died due to the virus, according to county health officials.

The Oswego County Health Department on Friday [3 Sep 2021] reported 2 horses in the town of Palermo died earlier this week after becoming infected with eastern equine encephalitis (EEE). Health officials said the diagnosis was confirmed in test results released Friday [3 Sep 2021] by the state Department of Health (DOH).

The county Health Department said the horses lived on the same farm and had not been vaccinated for EEE.

Oswego County Public Health Director Jiancheng Huang on Friday [3 Sep 2021] said EEE remains active in the local environment and mosquito population and would until the 1st heavy frost occurs later this year [2021].

"Until we have a killing frost, people in all areas of Oswego County need to fully protect themselves from mosquito bites when they participate in outdoor activities," he said. "Please avoid being outdoors during the periods when mosquitoes are most active, primarily around dusk and dawn. If you are outdoors, you should be wearing long pants and long sleeves, and using insect repellents."

EEE was discovered for the 1st time this year [2021] in late July in the town of Albion, and the virus has since been detected in several other areas across the county, including sampling sites in Palermo, West Monroe, Hastings, Central Square, and Constantia. EEE has been detected in Oswego County mosquito populations for at least 8 straight years, largely in the Toad Harbor Swamp and Albion areas.

"EEE is endemic to our area," Huang said in a statement Friday [3 Sep 2021]. "Our surveillance shows the virus is still active in Oswego County. We continue to monitor and assess mosquito and virus activities. We work closely with the state Department of Health, which provides support and guidance."

The county Health Department recently conducted aerial spraying of the Toad Harbor Swamp area, and Huang said health officials are discussing another round of aerial spraying. Huang, however, has noted aerial spraying is a temporary, partial measure to control EEE, and individuals should continue to protect themselves from mosquitoes.

Local health officials encourage individuals in Oswego County to use insect repellents when spending extended periods outdoors, and to take proactive steps to reduce mosquito populations around the home.

According to the county, insect repellents containing DEET, picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus are most effective and noted that repellents containing permethrin are meant for clothing and gear and should not be applied directly to the skin. Individuals should read product labels and follow package instructions. [The same is true for the horses; please use only horse-approved mosquito repellent spray, as many other things can be toxic to your horse. - Mod.TG]

Individuals should also limit outdoor activities between dusk and dawn when mosquitoes are most active, and wear protective clothing, including long sleeves, pants, socks, and shoes when weather permits.

In an effort to reduce mosquito habitats around the home, residents are advised to take the following steps:
- Repair or replace window and door screens to keep mosquitoes outside and reduce or eliminate all standing water.
- Dispose of old tires, which can be significant mosquito breeding sites. Used tires are accepted at local transfer stations.
- Empty or dispose of pails, cans, flowerpots, and similar water-holding containers.
- Drill holes in the bottoms of recycling containers that are kept outdoors.
- Clear roof gutters and be sure they drain properly.
- Turn over wheelbarrows and wading pools when not in use.
- Clean and chlorinate swimming pools, outdoor saunas, and hot tubs, and drain pool covers.
- Change the water in birdbaths and horse troughs at least twice weekly.
- Remove leaf debris from yards and gardens, and clean vegetation and debris from the edge of ponds.
- Use landscaping to eliminate standing water.

Onslow County has made efforts to control mosquitoes in the Hubert area after a horse was found dead. Onslow County officials say the horse was given the presumptive diagnosis of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) as the cause of death. Officials say the horse was 4 years old and at a self-boarded facility.

After Onslow officials were notified, mosquito control measures were put into place. Officials say traps were also set, and those collected are being sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to test for the presence of EEE.

The deceased horse had not been vaccinated, which is encouraged by Onslow County officials.

Onslow County Health Director Kristen Richmond-Hoover suggests the guidance of the CDC (see https://www.cdc.gov/easternequineencephalitis/gen/pre.html) for residents to stay safe from mosquito bites.

[7] North Carolina (New Hanover County): Reporting error

https://www.wwaytv3.com/2021/09/17/recent-test-shows-eastern-equine-encephalitis-virus-among-mosquitoes-at-fort-fisher/


Earlier this week, New Hanover County Public Health reported a positive sample of eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) in a local mosquito pool at Fort Fisher in Kure Beach based on information provided by the state.

On Thursday [16 Sep 2021], the state informed New Hanover County Public Health that the CDC lab made a clerical mistake in the mosquito pooling report sent to the county, and the positive pool was not a _Culex nigripalpus_ mosquito species pool at Fort Fisher in Kure Beach but was actually a _Culiseta melanura_ mosquito species pool at the Marathon trap in North Castle Hayne.

This updated information should ease public concerns, because the _Culiseta melanura_ mosquito species bites birds almost exclusively, and rarely bites humans. Birds are a main reservoir for EEE transmission, which is how it was likely transmitted and then found within the sample. In addition, the Marathon mosquito trap is along a stream deep in the woods with little human population.

Horse farms in the North Castle Hayne area are encouraged to be proactive and ensure their horses have received the EEE vaccine. The American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP) recommends horses be vaccinated annually, at a minimum, and additional information about EEE in horses can be found at the North Carolina State University veterinary website (https://cvm.ncsu.edu/nc-state-university-veterinarian-on-protecting-horses-from-eastern-equine-encephalitis/).

The county has updated the online press release with this information.

New Hanover County Public Health's Mosquito Control division monitors mosquito activity throughout the county, including coastal areas, and helps control the mosquito population through active surveillance, community education, larviciding to target larvae in breeding environments, and targeted ultra-low volume spraying to kill adult mosquitos based on surveillance data with EPA-registered pesticide approved for public health use in urban environments.

"In addition to this positive sample in trapped mosquitos in New Hanover County, eastern equine encephalitis has also recently been found in a horse in Pender County and one in Brunswick County," said Public Health Director David Howard. "While human incidence of EEEV is rare, it is a dangerous viral infection causing severe disease, so residents should protect themselves by preventing mosquito bites. First and foremost, eliminate all standing water regularly by 'tipping and tossing,' as only a small amount of water can breed mosquitos; also use EPA-approved insect repellent according to labeling instructions. Other options include wearing long sleeves and pants and limiting outdoor activity at dawn and dusk when mosquitoes are known to be most active."

New Hanover County Mosquito Control continuously monitors mosquito activity throughout the county and is increasing surveillance and control in the Kure Beach area, including planned mosquito spraying this evening, Monday, 13 Sep [2021], beginning at 6 p.m.

The eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus was recently identified in eastern North Carolina. Horses in the 3 counties of Brunswick, Pender, and Onslow were recently diagnosed with EEE. In addition, the EEE virus was detected in a sample of mosquitoes in New Hanover County. So far, no human cases of EEE have been identified in North Carolina this year [2021].

Eastern equine encephalitis virus is transmitted by being bitten by an infected mosquito. It can cause serious illness not only in horses, donkeys, emu, and ostriches but also in people. Unusual for people, EEE is one of the most serious mosquito-borne diseases in both horses and humans in the United States. About 1/3 of people who get sick with EEE die. Many people who survive EEE suffer from long-term brain injury. People under the age of 15 and over the age of 50 are at greatest risk of developing serious illness. From 2003 to 2020, 12 cases of EEE were reported in North Carolina, with infections occurring from July to December.

In North Carolina, the EEE virus is most commonly detected in the eastern part of the state, and the virus usually passes between wild birds and mosquitoes. Mosquitoes, the main vector of EEE, spend most of their time in freshwater wetlands, most often biting birds rather than horses or humans.

You can protect yourself from EEE by avoiding mosquito bites. It is important to use effective mosquito repellents consistently during the months they are active. The 2nd method is mosquito control efforts, especially in areas near freshwater wetlands. There is no vaccine for protecting human beings from EEE, and when human beings become infected, they do not heal. Treatment is limited to the management of symptoms of the disease.

[Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) is carried by mosquitoes and is preventable [in horses] with a vaccine. The vaccine is a combination vaccine and usually includes EEE and WEE (western equine encephalitis), West Nile virus (WNV), and tetanus. Thus, there is a lot of value in this combination vaccine. As this is early September, some locations may need to repeat the vaccine in 3 months. Also, if this is the 1st time an animal is vaccinated, then it will need a 2nd vaccine in 2-3 weeks, and then a single shot in 3 months. Immunity to EEE wanes in 3-4 months. So, if you are in mosquito territory, such as by a coast or river, or a hurricane has come through, bringing more mosquitoes, it may be a good idea to re-vaccinate your horse. - Mod.TG
