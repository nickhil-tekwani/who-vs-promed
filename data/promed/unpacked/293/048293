A Comment on ProMED-mail Post: "Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome - USA (TX)"
-----------------------------------------------
The ProMED-mail report "Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome - USA (TX),"
archive number 20060301.0654, contains many inconsistencies and is
misleading.
(1) Sin Nombre virus (SNV), the etiologic agent of hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome (HPS), is not pathogenic for deer mice
(_Peromyscus maniculatus_), the principal rodent host of this virus.
Perhaps there were so many deer mice that a few died of old age, but
it was not SNV that killed the mice. And were they deer mice?
(2) One cannot make a definitive diagnosis of HPS by autopsy. This
must be done by detection of SNV, detection of SNV RNA, or by
serologic means.
(3) If the victim did die of HPS and definitive information was
omitted from the report, then "it was unclear where he contracted the
virus infection" is an important and relevant phrase.
(4) That information came from "a serviceman on base, through a
family member" says a great deal.
(5) The report further states that "7 service members had been
admitted there since Friday with symptoms of viral illness but that 4
have tested negative for hantavirus, with results pending for the 3
others." Allow me to interpret this: "No other SNV infections have
been detected."
(6) It is good to know that the military is finally cleaning up these
apparently filthy buildings.
(7) "Sin Nombre" in Spanish means "without a name;" "No nombre" means
"no name."
This is not a legitimate and accurate report and should be taken with
a grain of salt until further information is available, real data
rather than rumor.

[ProMED-mail appreciates Dr. Calisher's assistance in drawing
attention to the inconsistencies and inaccuracies in this press
report. No further information about this case of HPS has been
released, and the precise source of the infection remains unclear.
ProMED would welcome any additional information on this case. -
