Argentina: A Massive Enterovirus Outbreak in Rioja Province
-----------------------------------------------
Sanitary authorities will present today [23 Jan 2006] a report about the
cause of a massive enterovirus outbreak that has affected a quarter of the
inhabitants of the Ulapes community in Rioja province. Meanwhile, the
number of persons affected is decreasing, and new cases have been detected
in other provinces. The Health Minister of La Rioja province, Dr. Alejandro
Buso, indicated that other provinces, such as Chaco and Santiago, had cases
"above the normal range, so it is becoming a national epidemic outbreak."
Enterovirus infection has caused diarrheal disease in more than 800 of the
2700 inhabitants of Ulapes, and these persons have received urgent medical
care in order to prevent further complications. A team of professionals
from the National Epidemiology General [Directorate] who are visiting the
affected area in order to study this massive outbreak will stay in Ulapes
until today [23 Jan 2006]. They will present a final report about the
outbreak. Teams from the province "will stay in place for some time until
the outbreak is controlled," stated the Health Minister. Dr. Buso said that
"there has been a reduction in the number of cases" of persons affected by
enterovirus infection in Ulapes. "Since yesterday (speaking about Fri 21
Jan 2006), a reduction in the number of cases has been observed; we are
entering the descending portion of the curve, and now we are engaged in a
prevention campaign in the 9 Departments of the part of the province
affected," Dr. Buso explained. According to the Minister of Health, even
though "it is usual to experience enterovirus infection at this time of
year, [the number of cases greatly exceed] the usual number, and,
consequently, we are taking preventive measures."
An official said that the source of the infection has not been determined
yet, and "for us, the main thing is to stop any transmission route, since
this now is multifactorial." Dr. Buso pointed out that enterovirus
infection "is not a new disease, and in summertime, it appears in every
province with a warm climate. The important thing is that it does not
become an epidemic as it did in Ulapes."

[The identity of the etiologic agent is not immediately clear from the
above description. The phrase "enterovirus infection" is used in the sense
of a virus infection transmitted by an enteric route. There are many
potential agents that might be responsible for such an outbreak of
gastrointestinal illness. Control of such outbreaks is dependent on
implementation of measures to minimize the transmission of infection by the
fecal-oral route. Strict attention to personal hygiene, proper management
of food preparation and storage, provision of clean water supplies and
adequate sewage disposal are all obligatory.
Further information on the progress of the outbreaks and the identification
of the agent responsible would be welcomed. - Mod.CP]
