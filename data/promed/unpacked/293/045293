[The above is the 3rd outbreak within an event, caused by foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus serotype A, which reportedly had started on 9 Jun 2013 in southern China. No deaths have been reported. The details of the 3 outbreaks were the following:

1. Village Heping (Xianggelila, Diqing, province of Yunnan). Started 9 Jun 2013.
Cattle: 1213 susceptible, 283 cases, 1213 destroyed. Swine: 554 susceptible, no cases, 554 destroyed.

2. Village Zhuxi (Bomi, Linzhi, province of Tibet). Started 5 Jul 2013.
Cattle: 181 susceptible, 51 cases, 181 destroyed. Swine: 308 susceptible, 21 cases, 308 destroyed.

3. Quma township (Lazi, Rikaze, province of Tibet). Started 5 Aug 2013.
Cattle: 413 susceptible, 20 cases, 413 destroyed. No swine.
Report with map at http://tinyurl.com/m5tnaon.

According to the above OIE reports, stamping out policy has been applied for the control of these outbreaks. Vaccination is, reportedly, "not prohibited"; no information on the vaccination history of the affected animals/holdings is included. Such information will be helpful.

According to China's 2012 information to the OIE, FMD vaccination is allowed and routinely (compulsorily?) applied in cattle, sheep, goats and swine). The annual FMD vaccines production figures for 2012 were:
Conjugate Vaccine: 962 184 300 doses (no export data)
Inactivated Vaccine: 1 323 426 700 doses (no export data)

It will be helpful to note if vaccination (or booster-vaccination) is being applied in animals situated in locations around the depopulated farms. China's cattle population (2012) was 103 430 000, while the swine population was 475 922 000. - Mod.AS
