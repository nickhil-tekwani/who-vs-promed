Officials are warning the public after 3 people in South Carolina became ill from eating shellfish. The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control [DHEC] said on Wednesday, 16 Oct 2013, that the 3 people have confirmed cases. DHEC said the bacterium causes gastroenteritis, not cholera.

"We are working with the FDA and many partners to identify the source of the contaminated shellfish," said Linda Bell, MD and state epidemiologist. "We are informing healthcare providers of the situation and will continue to monitor the state for additional cases."

DHEC said there is no evidence the contaminated shellfish originated in South Carolina waters.

They said the symptoms of _Vibrio cholerae_ include nausea, vomiting and diarrhea that begin from a few hours to up to 5 days after consumption of raw shellfish. The infection is usually mild or without symptoms, but can occasionally be severe. In severe cases, an infected person may experience profuse watery diarrhea and vomiting that can cause dehydration and shock, DHEC said.

"The elderly, young and immunocompromised are particularly at risk of developing illness from consuming raw shellfish," said Bell. "The best way to protect yourself and your family from getting ill is to thoroughly cook all shellfish before eating."

[Given the statement that the infections were "not cholera," the organisms identified in the SC cases were likely non-epidemic strains of _Vibrio cholerae_ that were non-O1 and non O-139 isolates. Overall, non-O1, non-O139 strains of _V. cholerae_ tend to (but not always) cause milder gastrointestinal illness and also can have bacteremic, non-diarrhea presentations.

In almost all cases, non-O1, non-O139 _V. cholerae_ isolates do not possess the genes for either cholera toxin or the toxin-coregulated pilus (TCP). Yet, some isolates can cause substantial diarrhea (1-4). The type III secretion system (TTSS) is a mechanism for Gram negative bacilli to introduce effector proteins into host cell cytoplasm (5). It has been reported that a functional TTSS is required for at least some non-O1, non-O139 isolates to induce diarrhea in an animal model associated with small bowel damage and production of proinflammatory cytokines (6). In addition, TTSS contributes to virulence even in the presence of cholera toxin and TCP (6).
