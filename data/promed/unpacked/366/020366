Monkey malaria in Malaysia and Philippines: _Plasmodium knowlesi_
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Scientists investigating a form of malaria that is causing some concern in Malaysia and the Philippines have been making some progress to better understand the workings of this new menace. The new malaria is caused by the parasite _Plasmodium knowlesi_, mostly found in Sabah [Malaysia] and Palawan (the Philippines).

The parasite is carried by long-tailed macaques.

Scientists from Malaysia, the Philippines, United Kingdom and Australia recently gathered at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Kota Kinabalu to review the "Monkeybar" project investigating this new malaria.

_P. knowlesi_ has recently been added to the list of known human malaria. Dr Timothy William, the principal Malaysian investigator of the Monkeybar project, said that although the natural hosts of this malaria are macaque monkeys, over the last 10 years it has been found in the human population. "It is now the most common human malaria in Malaysian Borneo (Sabah and Sarawak)," he added. He said over the past 2 decades Malaysia has made extraordinary progress in eliminating malaria. "It is only because of this success that the importance of _P. knowlesi_ has become apparent.

Previously, relatively little was known about how and why it has crossed over into the human population," he added. The 5-year project is now in its 3rd year, and is collecting some useful data. Prof Chris Drakeley of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said the new disease has been shown to respond well to current malarial treatments.

[_Plasmodium knowlesi_ was previously classified as _Plasmodium malariae_, and it was the use of molecular typing of the plasmodia, which made it apparent that the infections were indeed _P. knowlesi_. So far transmission is from the macaques to humans, and human-to-human transmission has, to our knowledge, not been found. - Mod.EP
