Bird flu virus found among birds that died in Rostov region
-----------------------------------------------------------
A comprehensive analysis of the pathological material of poultry that
died at the Gulyay-Borisovskaya battery farm in the Zernograd
district, Rostov region, has detected bird flu virus H5N1, Krasnodar
Territory Chief Veterinary Vladimir Shevkoplyas said.

"The All Russian Animal Health Protection Institute conducted this
analysis detecting bird flu virus H5N1. We sympathize with our
colleagues in the Rostov region, we ourselves have lived under tense
conditions since 2006, when the 1st serous outbreak of the virus
happened at Tbilisskaya battery farm," Shevkoplyas said at a
territorial commission on prevention of bird flu and hog cholera.

Deputy Krasnodar Territory Governor Nikolai Dyachenko demanded that
every necessary measure be taken to secure the Krylovsky district,
Krasnodar Territory which borders the Zernograd district, Rostov
region, as well as neighboring Kushchevsky, Novopokrovsky and
Beloglinsky districts.

According to earlier reports, 450 000 hens are slated to be destroyed
in the Zernograd district, Rostov region because of the die-off of
birds that began last week. Expertise revealed A type flu among the
dead poultry.

Another case of bird flu in Poland
==--------------------------------
The number of bird flu cases in Poland has risen to 5. Vets
pronounced 3 wild birds in the village of Krzykaly, north-east
Poland, to be infected with the H5N1 virus.

As was announced by Ludwik Bartoszewicz, chief vet of the
warminsko-mazurskie province, at a press conference yesterday [11 Dec
2007] evening, 3 birds from the bird recovery centre in Krzykaly died
of bird flu.

The presence of the virus was confirmed in detailed medical
examinations in the National Veterinary Institute in Pulawy, eastern Poland.

There are more birds left in the recovery centre, among them 2
cranes, a white stork and mute swan. As these are all protected
species the decision whether to cull them will have to be consulted
with the Minister of the Environment.

A 10-km [6.2-mile] exclusion zone has been set out around the last
bird flu focus. There are several chicken farms in the area with
around 45 000 birds on them.
