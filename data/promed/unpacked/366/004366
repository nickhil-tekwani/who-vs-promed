116th human case of avian influenza A/(H5N1) influenza
------------------------------------------------------
Dr Abdel Rahman Shahin, spokesman for the Egyptian Ministry of Health,
announced the discovery of a new case of bird flu [avian influenza
A/(H5N1) virus infection]. The patient is a 56-year-old woman resident
in the eastern governorate of Sharqia. She becomes the 116th human
case since the onset of the outbreak [in Egypt in 2006].

Dr Shaheen stated that the woman had been admitted to a hospital in
Sharqia governorate suffering from high fever, cough, and with
difficulty in breathing. She had been exposed to domestic poultry
suspected of being infected with the bird flu virus. She had been
administered the drug Tamiflu on suspicion of avian influenza virus
infection and throat swabs had been sent for laboratory examination.

The official spokesman stated that the patient has developed
pneumonia, but remains in a stable condition and has been transferred
to a hospital in Cairo.

[Confirmation of this 116th human case of avian A/(H5N1) influenza
virus infection by the World Health Organisation (WHO) is awaited.
(The WHO table of Confirmed Human Cases of Avian Influenza A(H5N1) at
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2010_12_09/en/index.html> has not been updated since 9 Dec
2010).

It is unclear from this translation whether the diagnosis in fact has
been laboratory confirmed. In total, 38 of the 116 cases identified in
Egypt have been fatal since the beginning of the outbreak in March 2006.
