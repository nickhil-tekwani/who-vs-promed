A 19-year-old man died as a consequence of bartonellosis (also known
as Carrion's disease and Peruvian wart) in the La Mercedes Hospital of
Chiclayo [Lambayeque region]. The young man was a farmer from Piura
region who was referred to the hospital in Chiclayo after continually
presenting fever. The illness led to his death on 8 Jul 2011.

The chief of general medicine of the hospital, Winston Maldonado,
said that the health of the patient was compounded by a renal failure
that finally caused his death. "We were surprised that he had Carrion
disease, a disease that was believed to have been eradicated, although
it is an isolated case. We already notified the Regional Health Bureau
to take all appropriate preventive measures", the doctor said.

[Bartonellosis comprises infections caused by newly emerging
pathogens. In 1909, Alberto Barton described organisms that adhered to
red blood cells (RBCs). The name _Bartonia_, later _Bartonella
bacilliformis_, was used for the only member of the group identified
before 1993. _Rochalimaea_ (named for Rocha-Lima), a similar group,
were recently combined with _Bartonella_. Although these organisms
were originally thought to be rickettsiae, _Bartonella_ bacteria can
be grown on artificial media, unlike rickettsiae.

At least a dozen species belong to the genus _Bartonella_. 3 species
are considered important causes of human disease, but other
significant human pathogens in this genus will undoubtedly be found in
the future. _B. bacilliformis_ causes Oroya fever and verruga peruana
(Peruvian wart, also known as Carrion's disease). _B. henselae_ causes
cat scratch disease (CSD). _B. quintana_ causes trench fever. Either
_B. henselae_ or _B. quintana_ may cause peliosis of the liver (often
called bacillary peliosis; characterized by cystic, blood-filled
spaces in the liver), infections in homeless populations, and
infections in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). New species that may cause
human disease include _B. vinsonii_, _B. clarridgeiae_, and _B.
elizabethae_. Several of these other species are found in animals.

_Bartonella bacilliformis_ is endemic in the Andean Mountain regions
of Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia and usually substantially above sea
level but seems to have expanded its range to lower altitudes between
the highlands and jungles. The vector is the sandfly, _Lutzomyia
verrucarum_.

The acute form of the disease caused by _B. bacilliformis_ gets its
name from an outbreak that occurred in 1871 near La Oroya, Peru. More
than 7000 people perished. Some survivors later developed a skin
disease called verruga peruana (Peruvian wart). These skin lesions
were observed prior to the 1871 outbreak -- perhaps as far back as the
pre-Columbian era -- but a connection to Oroya fever was unknown. In
1885, a young medical researcher, Daniel Carrion, inoculated himself
with blood from a lesion to study the course of the skin disease. When
he became ill with Oroya fever, the connection became apparent. Oroya
fever is often called Carrion's disease in honor of his fatal
experiment.

Although the bacterium, _B. bacilliformis_, was isolated by Alberto
Barton in 1909, it was not identified as the cause of the fever until
1940. The _Bartonella_ genus includes at least 11 bacteria species, 4
of which cause human diseases, including cat-scratch disease and
bacillary angiomatosis. However, bartonellosis generally refers
exclusively to the disease caused by _B. bacilliformis_. The disease
is limited to a small area of the Andes Mountains in western South
America; nearly all cases have been in Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador. A
large outbreak involving thousands of people occurred in 1940-41, but
bartonellosis has since occurred sporadically. Control of sandflies,
the only known disease vector, has been credited with managing the
disease.

Once in the bloodstream, the bacteria attach to red blood cells
(erythrocytes). For a picture of a blood smear with the organism
associated with red blood cells see
http://web.mst.edu/~microbio/BIO221_2004/bartonella-1.jpg. Bacilli
can also enter the red blood cells.

In the process, up to 90 percent of the host's erythrocytes are
destroyed, causing severe hemolytic anemia. The anemia is accompanied
by high fever, muscle and joint pain, delirium, and sometimes coma.

An infected individual may develop verruga peruana 2-8 weeks after
the acute phase. However, individuals may exhibit the characteristic
lesions without ever experiencing the acute phase or even precede the
bacteremic phase. Left untreated, the lesions may last months or
years. These lesions resemble blood-filled blisters, up to 4 cm in
diameter, and appear primarily on the head and limbs. They can be
painful to the touch and may bleed or ulcerate; see
http://pathmicro.med.sc.edu/mayer/Bartonellosis8.jpg.

Bartonellosis is identified by symptoms and the patient's history,
such as recent travel in areas where bartonellosis occurs. Isolation
of _B. bacilliformis_ from the bloodstream or lesions can confirm the
diagnosis. Antimicrobial agents are the mainstay of bartonellosis
treatment. The bacteria are susceptible to several antibiotics,
including chloramphenicol, penicillins, and aminoglycosides. Blood
transfusions may be necessary to treat the anemia caused by
bartonellosis.

Antibiotics have dramatically decreased the fatality associated with
bartonellosis. Prior to the development of antibiotics, the fever was
fatal in 40 percent of cases. With antibiotic treatment, that rate has
dropped to 8 percent. Fatalities can result from complications
associated with severe anemia and secondary infections. Once the
infection is halted, an individual can recover fully. - Mod.LL]
