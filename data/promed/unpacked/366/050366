Subject: Emergency Management Warning 97: Exotic Newcastle Disease in
the United States
Exotic Newcastle disease (END) was confirmed on 1 Oct 2002, in the
State of California and is now in the final phase of total
eradication. For the past 4 week only 7 new backyard urban flocks
have been detected and they were immediately depopulated. The Animal
and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has also recently taken
the following significant regulatory actions:
1. A prohibition on the interstate and international movement of
animals for fighting, which directly addressed gamefowl movements for
fighting, was published in the Federal Register on 12 May 2003.
2. With the complete eradication of END in the States of Nevada and
Arizona, effective on 14 May 2003, APHIS lifted federal quarantines
on the 5 counties affected in Nevada and Arizona. Additionally, all
Federal/State emergency response incident command posts in the 2
States have been closed.
3. With the successful eradication of END in the single index flock
in Texas, the Federal/State incident command post in Socorro, TX has
also been closed.
APHIS is currently conducting END strategy meetings planning for
final eradication and surveillance activities. All U.S. trading
partners should be assured that all commercial U.S. poultry genetics
and products can be certified as END-free.

For immediate release 28 May 2003
Animal Health Officials Confident Exotic Newcastle Disease (END) is
Wiped Out in El Paso. Most Restrictions Released; Others Remain
State and federal animal health authorities are one step closer to
releasing restrictions on birds in El Paso County, following an
outbreak of the deadly bird virus Exotic Newcastle Disease (END) in
backyard birds in El Paso in early April 2003. After testing more
than 800 backyard flocks in El Paso and surrounding counties,
regulatory veterinarians say they have sufficient evidence that there
is no additional END infection in the area. END can be spread among
all bird species, causing losses of up to 100 percent. END is a
foreign animal disease and results in international trade
restrictions.
"As of Wednesday afternoon, 28 May 2003, birds and poultry may again
be moved freely within El Paso County. There is no need to obtain a
permit to move birds within the county," announced Dr. Bob Hillman,
Texas state veterinarian and executive director for the Texas Animal
Health Commission (TAHC), the state's livestock and poultry health
regulatory agency.
"On 10 Apr 2003, a 5-county quarantined area was established to
contain the disease, detected in a flock of backyard birds in El Paso
County. On 15 Apr 2003, the TAHC stopped all bird movement within El
Paso County, while teams continued working to eradicate the disease.
We began issuing permits 8 May 2003 to allow pet birds to be moved
within the county. Today, we are lifting movement restrictions,
allowing both pet birds and poultry to be moved freely within the El
Paso County boundaries."
Dr. Hillman explained that El Paso County birds and poultry still may
not be transported beyond the county borders, until state and federal
quarantines are lifted. "The task force in El Paso has submitted a
request to the USDA for federal quarantine release, and the
supporting documentation is being reviewed. We hope the process will
take only a few days," he said. Until the quarantines are released,
birds and poultry still may not moved out of El Paso and Hudspeth
Counties in Texas, and Dona Anna, Luna, and Otero Counties in New
Mexico.
"USDA and state quarantines will be lifted simultaneously. A very
small area within El Paso County, however, will remain quarantined
until mid-October 2003," said Dr. Coats, TAHC's deputy director for
animal health programs. "The precise dimensions of this long-term
quarantined area are being determined, but will encompass the
premises and the surrounding area where the outbreak started.
Movement of birds from this specific area must be restricted until at
least mid-October, so that we can be assured no virus remains in the
area, and to meet requirements for regaining international trade
status."
Dr. Coats said the task force's incident command center in Socorro
will be closed in the next few days. "We still urge residents to
call with questions or to report sick birds, so that they may be
tested," he said.
He referred callers in Texas to the TAHC's 24-hour hotline at
1-800-550-8242, or to the USDA's Veterinary Services office in Texas
at 512-916-5552. In New Mexico, bird owners may call the New Mexico
Livestock Board at 505-841-6161 or the USDA's Veterinary Services
office in New Mexico at 505-761-3160.
"This disease eradication effort is an excellent example of the
coordination among local and state emergency management personnel,
Texas and New Mexico state veterinarians' offices, and the USDA,"
said Dr. Hillman. "This teamwork is essential for successfully
managing an animal health emergency."
"This disease outbreak started during my first week in Texas as TAHC
executive director, and I was very impressed by the response of the
private veterinary practitioners, producers, pet and feed store
operators, and everyone who joined in to ensure this would be a
short-lived disease outbreak," he said. "The cooperation in the
community has been outstanding, and the work of all parties involved
has been exemplary. We expect to hear about the federal quarantine
releases very soon and will provide information quickly, so that
normal commerce and routines can be re-established."
