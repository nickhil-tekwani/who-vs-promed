The Veteran's Administration (VA) is sending out a rabies warning to
those who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The VA urges anyone who served within the past 18 months to get
treatment if they were bitten or scratched by an animal, or if a bat
was found in their living quarters. The alert comes after a California
soldier died of the infection just a few months after returning from
his tour.

[This alert appears to be a direct consequence of the death of a
serviceman at Fort Drum, New York state who had returned from
Afghanistan recently. He had contracted rabies from the bite of a
feral dog while deployed there. He had not received post-exposure
vaccination, nor exhibited symptoms, prior his return to the United
States.

Rabies virus is transmitted to humans by the saliva of an infected
animal (usually a dog) through a bite wound, contact with mucous
membranes or broken skin. Humans can become infected and harbor the
virus for weeks to months, and in extremely rare cases, years before
becoming ill. During the incubation period, which averages between one
and 3 months, rabies can be prevented with appropriate treatment,
which involves immunoglobulin administration and a series of
anti-rabies vaccinations. Once symptoms occur, however, death is
almost always the outcome. Consequently, servicemen returning from
deployment in a rabies endemic country (which would include
Afghanistan and Iraq) should request treatment even if they show no
symptoms of infection following injury during contact with even an
apparently normal dog or other susceptible animal. - Mod.CP]
