In April and May 1997, CDC received reports of seven event-associated
clusters of cases of cyclosporiasis from five states (California, Florida,
Nevada, New York, and Texas). Approximately 80 cases of infection with human-
associated _Cyclospora_ sp., a recently characterized coccidian parasite,
have been laboratory-confirmed. State and local health departments, CDC, and
the Food and Drug Administration are conducting investigations to identify
the vehicles of infection.
Both foodborne and waterborne outbreaks of cyclosporiasis have previously
been reported in the United States during spring and summer months. In 1996,
a total of 978 laboratory- confirmed cases of cyclosporiasis in the United
States and Canada were reported in association with a widespread foodborne
outbreak. The average incubation period of cyclosporiasis is 1 week.
Illness can be protracted (from days to weeks) with frequent, watery stools
and other gastrointestinal symptoms; symptoms may remit and relapse. Health-
care providers should consider _Cyclospora_ sp. infection in persons with
prolonged diarrheal illness and specifically request laboratory testing for
this parasite, which is not routinely performed by most laboratories.
Cyclosporiasis can be treated with a 7-day course of oral trimethoprim (TMP)-
sulfamethoxazole (SMX) (for adults, 160 mg TMP plus 800 mg SMX twice daily;
for children, 5 mg/kg TMP plus 25 mg/kg SMX twice daily). Treatment regimens
for patients who cannot tolerate sulfa drugs have not yet been identified.
Health departments that identify cases of cyclosporiasis should contact CDC's
Division of Parasitic Diseases, National Center for Infectious Diseases,
telephone (770) 488-7760.
