Koi herpesvirus [KHV] was 1st isolated in the United Kingdom in 2000
during a disease outbreak in northern England. Outbreaks of clinical
disease with signs similar to KHV disease had been reported in 1998
and 1999. Later, KHV DNA was detected in tissue samples taken in 1996
during an unexplained mass mortality of koi and common carp in the UK;
see "KHV in the UK," page 32, in "Trout News," No 38, July 2004,
available at
http://www.cefas.co.uk/publications/troutnews/tnews38.pdf.

The disease has been found to be spread to many countries worldwide,
predominantly through the trade in koi carp, before the current
knowledge of the disease and means to detect it were available. It is
now known to occur in, or has been recorded in fish imported into, at
least 23 different countries. In Europe, this includes Austria,
Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Poland,
Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. In Asia, China (Hong
Kong), Chinese Taipei, Indonesia, Japan, Korea (Rep. of), Malaysia,
Singapore (in fish imported from Malaysia), and Thailand (in fish
imported into Germany). Elsewhere, South Africa, Canada, and the
United States have reported occurrence of KHVD. It is likely that the
virus is present in many more countries but has not yet been
identified or reported.

Most of the above information on the geographical distribution of KHV
is included in chapter 2.3.6 of OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests for
Aquatic Animals 2011, accessible at
http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/aahm/2010/2.3.06_KHVD.pdf.
