--------------------------------------------------------------------
Further to your request for information on BTV-8 vaccination plans
and about the availability of vaccines to be applied in northwestern
Europe, may I bring to your attention a letter to the Parliament (No
VD. 2007/801, dated 5 Apr 2007) from the Dutch Minister of
Agriculture, G. Verburg, which included the following statement on
vaccination:
"Vaccination against bluetongue is permitted, in principle, according
to European legislation. However, no suitable vaccine against
BTV-8 (the serotype predominant in northwest Europe) is available yet.
The pharmaceutical industry has indicated that a suitable
(inactivated) vaccine could become available in mid 2008, but they are
waiting for a clear signal from the market. I have requested that the
agricultural industry prepare a cost-benefit analysis of vaccination".
To the best of my knowledge, the situation on vaccination in
northwest Europe has not changed since April [2007].

--------------------------------------------------------------------
To answer the question of the moderator [on vaccination and vaccine
availability], for your information:
LTO [see commentary] has, since September 2006m brought up the issue
of vaccination against BTV-8.
With the support of the European Parliament (MEP Jan Mulder) money
was allocated in the 2007 EU budget to support pharmaceutical
companies to develop vaccines against BTV-8.
Both Merial and Intervet have indicated they [have now developed]
inactivated vaccines. They are working with EMEA [European Agency for
the Evaluation of Medicinal Products] in London to get these
registered for EU-use by the end of 2007.
LTO is now, together with COPA-COGECA (EU umbrella) [COPA = Committee
of Professional Agricultural Organisations in the European Union;
COGECA = General Confederation of Agricultural Co-operatives in the
European Union. - Mod.AS] and the national farmers' organisations in
France, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Germany, doing a cost impact
analysis of the current BTV control measures and comparing these with
other possible measures such as (voluntary) vaccination of ruminants.
We take into account that BTV-8 has only caused significant economic
damage in the sheep sector and in particular in some (black headed)
sheep species (such as the so-called 'Mergelander sheep'). So far, no
goats have been found infected with BTV-8 in the 5 Member States.
The European Commission has already indicated it would support BTV
vaccination paying 50 percent of the costs based on a plan to be
submitted by the Member State.
In the Netherlands, the other 50 percent is likely to be paid by
animal owners. In other Member States, like France, chances are the
national government would pay the rest, as it does at the moment on
Corsica, where annual vaccination against BTV-2 is carried out.
On the current situation on the ground, now that BTV-8 has been found
again, it seems certain the disease will become endemic in central
Europe and it will spread further during the summer and autumn
seasons. So we will have to live with this disease.

[The 2 items above are complementary.
"LTO Nederland" is the Dutch Organisation for Agriculture and
Horticulture (Land- en Tuinbouw Organisatie Nederland) in the
Netherlands, an umbrella organisation for 5 regional and 16 sectoral
organisations in agriculture and horticulture. LTO has a particular
focus on political activities; its mission is "to stimulate a strong
economic and social position for farmers, and a sustainable
agricultural and horticultural industry in The Netherlands".
Since BTV-8 vaccine will not become available during the 2007 disease
season, which may last until December [2007], susceptible animals
within the affected areas may be seriously affected. These include
adult sheep and cattle which were not infected during 2006 and their
offspring, as well as offspring of animals affected in 2006 -- after
losing their maternal immunity (generally, 3-6 months).
As long as a vaccine is not available, the only means to try to
protect susceptible animals (particularly sheep of breeds known to be
vulnerable to the virus) is by the prevention of exposure to infected
culicoides. Could such animals be protected by the application of
insecticides or repellents, or rather by zootechnical means (such as
housing)? A satisfactory advice might be sought from entomologists,
and will depend upon the availability of updated information on the
identity and the ecology of the vector. - Mod.AS]
