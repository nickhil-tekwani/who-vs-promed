Meningitis Still Spreading
--------------------------
The meningitis outbreak in northern Namibia continues to claim victims,
even though vaccines have finally arrived after stocks were depleted within
2 days last month. The number of cases detected has risen to 65 in
Ohangwena, Oshana and Omusati and Oshikoto. Since Oct 2000, 9 people are
known to have died of the disease in northern and northeastern Namibia.
Top health official in the North, Dr. Naftali Hamata, said from his office
at Oshakati yesterday that 17 000 meningitis vaccine doses have arrived but
that syringes and needles have not yet been delivered from Windhoek.

[Namibia is not in the meningitis belt in Africa. On a review of the WHO
information sheet on meningitis, Namibia is not highlighted as having more
than 15 cases per 100 000 population. According to the Namibian Government
website, the projected population is 1.8 million (based on the 1991 census
with an annual growth rate of 3.1 percent), giving a reported
population-based rate of 36.1 cases per 100 000 population in this
outbreak. - Mod.MP]
[This is presumed to be a report of meningococcal meningitis. More specific
information about the strain of meningococcus responsible would be
appreciated. According to the GIDEON database, 130 cases of meningococcal
disease were reported in 1991; 364 in 1992; 104 in 1993; 2773 in 1994; 76
in 1995; 0 in 1999. - Mod.ES]
