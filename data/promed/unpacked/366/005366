The World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Africa recently released its updated Meningitis Weekly [2-29 Sep 2013] Bulletin [http://www.meningvax.org/files/BulletinMeningite2013_S36_39September.pdf], which shows the number of cases and fatalities from meningitis in 19 countries from the "African Meningitis Belt" and it shows that for the 1st 39 weeks [as of 29 Sep 2013] there were 16 385 cases including 1460 deaths. [For a map of the African meningitis belt see the source URL above.]

The overall lethality rate for this time frame is 8.9 percent. Nearly half (48 percent) of the total cases were reported from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (7880), which resulted in 712 deaths [a case-fatality rate of 9 percent]. Burkina Faso reported 2409 cases, being the country with the second most cases.

The countries of the African meningitis belt face outbreaks of the deadly bacterial disease every year.

According to the global health non-profit organization, PATH, about 450 million people are at risk of the deadly disease. Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, Chad, Sudan, and Ethiopia are considered hyperendemic, meaning populations in these countries are at the highest risk of developing meningitis.

[Outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis are reported in the sub-Saharan African region known as the "African meningitis belt" each year during the hot, dry season, between December and June (http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/yellowBookCh4-Menin.aspx). _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup A is said to be the most commonly isolated pathogen in the African meningitis belt. However, outbreaks have also been caused by other _N. meningitidis_ serogroups, such as serogroup C (http://www.cdc.gov/meningitis/lab-manual/chpt02-epi.html), W135 (http://www.expert-reviews.com/doi/abs/10.1586/14760584.5.3.319), and X (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X13004751), and in March 2012, a serogroup B outbreak occurred in Ethiopia (http://www.afro.who.int/en/clusters-a-programmes/dpc/epidemic-a-pandemic-alert-and-response/outbreak-news/3581-ethiopia-suspected-meningitis-outbreak-situation-as-of-08-march-2012-.html).

WHO recently reported (WHO Global Alert and Response, available at http://www.who.int/csr/don/2013_06_06_menin/en/index.html) that the number of cases reported from 1 Jan to 12 May 2013 (epidemiological week 19) is the lowest recorded during the epidemic season in the last 10 years (see ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - Africa: WHO meningitis region 20130606.1759273). The decrease in number of cases of meningitis was thought to be due to the progressive introduction of the newly developed meningococcal A conjugate vaccine in countries of the African meningitis belt since 2010. A preventive strategy based on conjugate vaccines could have a significantly larger and more enduring impact on attempts to control the yearly recurrences of this disease in Africa that causes considerable morbidity and mortality, especially among children (see http://www.jidc.org/index.php/journal/article/view/19745499/102). The meningococcal protein conjugate polysaccharide vaccines induce a T-cell-dependent response, resulting in an improved immune response in infants, provide long-lasting immunity, and prevent nasopharyngeal carriage of _N. meningitidis_, thus reducing transmission of this microorganism from person to person (see http://www.nfid.org/pdf/publications/meningococcalepid.pdf).

According to the WHO Meningitis Weekly Bulletin referred to above (Table 3, http://www.meningvax.org/files/BulletinMeningite2013_S36_39September.pdf), a bacterial pathogen was identified (by PCR, latex agglutination, or culture) in 802 out of 4209 (19 percent) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens that were obtained in the 16 385 (25.7 percent) meningitis cases. Of the bacterial pathogens identified, _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ was the most frequent (404 cases), followed by _N. meningitidis_ serogroup W135 (229 cases). _N. meningitidis_ serogroup A was identified in only 22 cases.

No bacterial pathogen was identified in almost 80 percent of the CSF specimens (3350 of the 4209). Presumably meningitis in these cases with CSF negative by PCR, latex agglutination, and culture was caused most commonly by viruses. In 57 CSF samples a contaminant was said to have been identified.

In Burkina Faso (BF), a CSF specimen was obtained in 1104 of 2409 cases (45.8 percent), but in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), in only 289 of 7880 (3.7 percent) cases. In Burkina Faso (BF), a bacterial pathogen was identified in 448 of the 1104 CSF specimens (40.6 percent) and in DRC in only 37 of the 289 CSF specimens (12.8 percent). In BF, _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ was the most frequent bacterial pathogen (244 cases), followed by _N. meningitidis_ W135 (165 cases). In DRC, "other pathogens" were most common (22 cases), followed by _S. pneumoniae_ (9 cases). - Mod.ML
