A group committed to preserving red squirrels has issued "strong advice" to people following an outbreak of squirrel pox in the Eden area.

The presence of the disease, which is fatal to red squirrels, was reported in the area around the Lowther Holiday Park near Penrith.

The Penrith and District Red Squirrel Group have asked people at the site to remove all squirrel and bird feeders, and to disinfect them as well as the feeding areas.

They also provided a list of signs and symptoms of the squirrel pox virus:
- skin ulcers;
- lesions and scabs;
- swelling and discharge from the lesions/ scabs near the eyes, mouth, feet and genitalia;
- lethargy and shivering.

Anyone who spots a squirrel exhibiting signs of the disease is asked to contact the Penrith and District Red Squirrel Group immediately on 07788 264 571.

According to the umbrella organisation Northern Red Squirrels, the origins of the squirrel pox virus are unknown. The 1st confirmed incident was in East Anglia in the 1980s.

Grey squirrels are carriers of the disease but are now immune to it.

The organisation adds that "infected animals are said to resemble rabbits with myxomatosis, in that they are sometimes found shivering and lethargic." Death is usually long and painful.

Information on countryfile.com states that there are now an estimated 120 000-140 000 red squirrels left in Britain; the majority residing in Scotland. Native reds first appeared 10 000 years ago.

The website adds that grey squirrels were introduced from North America in the 1800s. Unlike reds, they are able to digest acorns. They also have a better memory, allowing them to recover their own caches. Consequently they have been able to outcompete their counterparts, contributing to the dwindling numbers of reds.

[Squirrel pox is a viral disease that only affects squirrels. It is caused by a parapoxvirus that circulates naturally in gray and fox squirrel populations in eastern North America. While these species tolerate the infection, this virus results in fatal disease in red squirrels (_Sciurus vulgaris_), and it has resulted in extensive die-offs in the UK after its introduction in the island by grey squirrels (_S. carolinensis_) from North America, which rarely die from the disease. This virus was the main contributor to the red squirrel decline observed in Britain in the last 3 decades. Dispersal of grey squirrels in Ireland has been slower than that experienced in England and Wales. Until now, the disease was mainly found in England and Wales, sporadically in Scotland, and only a few years ago in Northern Ireland and Ireland, and not elsewhere in the red squirrel's European range. Pictures of a red squirrel with the typical lesions of the disease can be seen at https://news.images.itv.com/image/file/463604/image_update_img.jpg. - Mod.PMB]
