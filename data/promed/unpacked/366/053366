The Colorado Division of Wildlife has a surveillance programme for cases of
chronic wasting disease in elk and deer in the state based on hunter shot
animals.
So far this hunting season, 5/300 deer and 1/160 elk taken in Larimer
County have tested positive. Last year, by the end of the season, 6.5% of
deer and 1.5% of the elk tested positive.
Mike Miller, the DOW state veterinarian, commented that statewide testing
continues to indicate that the disease is concentrated in the Fort Collins
and Fort Morgan areas. Cases have also been reported in Wyoming. It is
unknown why it appears to be centered on Larimer county.
If any informed individuals in Colorado & Wyoming would care to comment on
this report, it would be greatly appreciated. Clearly there is much more
local knowlege of this disease than does this newspaper.
