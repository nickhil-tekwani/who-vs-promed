[Saudi Arabia's minister of agriculture and water Dr Abdullah Ibn Muammar
said more than 2417 cases of foot and mouth disease (FMD) have been
detected at 46 infected sites in different parts of the kingdom.
A total of 13 sites have been identified by the ministry in Riyadh region
alone. Muammar said the Agriculture Ministry had also registered 13
infected sites in the Eastern Province, 6 in Makkah region, 4 in Madinah
region, 3 in Asir region, 2 in Qassim region, and one in Hail region. A
total of 1767 cattle [presumably adult, Mod.SH and 650 sheep, besides
calves, goats, and other animals have been found infected with this disease.
After examining the measures put in place to contain the disease, the
minister said 141 cows and 88 sheep have died of the disease so far in
various parts of the kingdom. He said the veterinary teams have been sent
to a number of infected and suspected sites to ensure implementation of the
preventive measures and to educate the cattle farm owners in this regard.
The ministry, he said, had taken strict measures to disinfect the
cattle-rearing farms where the animals had been infected. He said 170 000
animals, mostly cows in the dairy farms, are being vaccinated as part of a
campaign to check the spread of the disease and reiterated [the message
that dairy products currently sold after strict laboratory tests in the
Saudi market are safe for human consumption.
Referring to the support extended by the United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization to contain the disease, Dr Muhammad Djerbi, FAO
program coordinator, said here yesterday the UN agency was supporting the
Kingdom to ensure better animal health. He said the FAO was always prepared
to work toward better control of the disease in Saudi Arabia and would
continue to offer all its support.
