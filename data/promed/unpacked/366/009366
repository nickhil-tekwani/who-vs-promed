Ebola Virus Brought into Uganda by Rebels based in Sudan?
---------------------------------------------------------
UGANDA: The [infectious agent that has killed 41 people in Uganda has been
identified as a strain of Ebola virus last seen in southern Sudan in 1979,
U.S. experts said Thursday, raising speculation that the virus may have been
[introduced into Uganda by Ugandan rebels based in Sudan. Pierre Rollin,
the leader of a U.S. Centers for Disease Control team, said the virus was
Ebola Sudan, one of the three [known strains of Ebola virus
This finding [suggests that rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army may have
introduced the disease during their regular attacks around Gulu, 225 miles
north of Kampala. The rebels have been fighting a 13-year war against
President Yoweri Museveni's government and have kidnapped thousands of
children, according to the United Nations and human rights organizations.
At least 41 people have died of Ebola and doctors fear 70 more may be
infected, said Okat Lokach, the Gulu district health director. Despite the
toll, World Health Organization experts praised local health workers for
their efforts in controlling the disease, saying the outbreak was likely to
be contained soon largely due to their efforts and the quick arrival of U.N.
and U.S. health experts.
The first Ebola case was admitted to Lacor Hospital in late September but
doctors did not immediately make an accurate diagnosis. A doctor and 2
nurses died within days. A blood sample was then sent to South Africa for
testing and the outbreak was officially confirmed last Saturday. Since then,
experts from WHO, aid workers from Doctors without Borders and investigators
from the Atlanta-based CDC have advised the Ugandans. A team of 4
epidemiologists and 2 microbiologists from CDC arrived Thursday, bringing
laboratory equipment to separate those infected from people with similar
symptoms, and to try to determine the source of the outbreak.
"If I compare this to my previous experiences, the facilities here are
outstanding compared to the classic Ebola situation," said Dr. Guenael
Rodier, the WHO team leader, who has worked on every Ebola outbreak since
1986. He said death and transmission rates have been kept down by "barrier
nursing" techniques in which health care workers wear surgical gear, masks,
gloves and knee-high boots and take steps to avoid contamination from
infected people. There is no cure for Ebola, but patients treated with
aggressive rehydration therapy have a chance of survival, Rodier said.
Typically, between 80 percent and 90 percent of Ebola victims die, but
Rodier said as many as 50 percent of the patients in Gulu may recover
because of good, early medical attention. Ugandan doctors attributed the
response to a culture that places emphasis on health and education. Uganda
was home to the first medical school in East Africa and is the only African
country that has slowed HIV infection rates.

[The Ebola viruses isolated in 1976 from the original simultaneous outbreaks
of hemorrhagic fever in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo) and
Sudan are now considered to be distinct subtypes of Ebola virus, designated
Ebola Zaire and Ebola Sudan. The resemblance of the Ugandan isolates to
Ebola Sudan is therefore a significant pointer to the origin of the current
outbreak around Gulu. - Mod.CP
