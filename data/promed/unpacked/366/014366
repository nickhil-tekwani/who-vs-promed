The Massachusetts Department of Public Health announced the 11th human case of eastern equine encephalitis [EEE] virus infection, a man in his 70s from Worcester County.

As a result, the communities of Auburn, Charlton, Dudley, Leicester, Southbridge, and Spencer have been elevated to high risk.

The Department of Public Health has also been recently notified by a hospital of a death from the virus of an Essex County resident. It marks the 4th death from eastern equine encephalitis virus this year [2019] in Massachusetts.

"Although mosquito populations are declining at this time of year, risk from EEE will continue until the1st hard frost," said state epidemiologist Dr Catherine Brown.

"We continue to emphasize the need for people to protect themselves from mosquito bites."

There are 35 communities now at critical risk, 46 at high risk and 122 at moderate risk for the virus in Massachusetts. A map of the state's current eastern equine encephalitis risk levels can be found at https://bit.ly/2mVNdnY.

In addition to the 11 human cases of the virus this season in Massachusetts, there have also been 8 confirmed cases of in animals -- 7 horses and a goat.

State officials continue to remind residents to take personal precautions to prevent mosquito bites.

Eastern equine encephalitis is a rare but serious and potentially fatal disease that can affect people of all ages. The virus occurs sporadically in Massachusetts, with the most recent outbreak years occurring from 2004 to 2006 and 2010 to 2012. There were 22 human cases of infection during those 2 outbreak periods, with 14 cases occurring among residents of Bristol and Plymouth counties.

The virus has been found in 422 mosquito samples this year [2019], many of them from species of mosquitoes capable of spreading the virus to people. An additional 83 mosquitos have tested positive for West Nile virus.

The Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources has now completed aerial spraying for mosquitoes for the season. Aerial spraying has been conducted in parts of Bristol, Plymouth, Middlesex, Norfolk, Worcester, Hampden, and Hampshire counties. Aerial spraying helps reduce risk of transmission, but some risk will continue to exist until there is a hard frost.

[The number of human EEE cases in Massachusetts continues to increase, with the diagnosis of the 11th case this 2019 season, with 4 deaths. A 21 Sep 2019 report stated that a 2nd person in Massachusetts has died from EEE. The patient was a man in his 70's and was the 10th confirmed case of EEE in the state (see Eastern equine encephalitis - North America (25): USA (CT, MA, MI) human 20190923.6688701). Now, there is one additional case. Killing frosts should be coming in the next 2-3 weeks [https://www.weather.gov/iwx/fallfrostinfo}, which will bring the EEE transmission season to an end. Meanwhile, Massachusetts residents and visitors should heed the advice to avoid mosquito bites and horse owners should vaccinate their animals if they have not done so already. - Mod.TY
