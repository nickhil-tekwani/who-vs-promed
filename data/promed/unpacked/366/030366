Malaria cases confirmed among Haitian football team
---------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health has confirmed 3 imported cases of malaria among
members of the Haitian under-17 football team who are in the island to
participate in the CONCACAF Under-17 Championship being held in
Montego Bay, St James.

The players are currently being treated. Some of their teammates are
also displaying symptoms of the illness and are undergoing treatment.

The ministry has recommended that in the circumstances they do not
participate in the tournament and therefore return to Haiti. These
arrangements are presently being made.

The Ministry has implemented its surveillance system to be able to
quickly identify and treat any other cases. Vector control measures,
including fogging of adult mosquitoes have also been put in place.

There have been no locally transmitted cases of malaria since the
start of the year.

Malaria is transmitted when a female Anopheles mosquito, infected with
a malaria parasite, bites an individual. Symptoms include fever,
chills and headaches, muscle aches and tiredness.

A Jamaican government statement said that the Haitian team arrived in
apparently good health on 3 Feb 2011, 6 team members were febrile on
14 Feb 2011 and 8 more subsequently, and all left Jamaica on 16 Feb
2011 at the Jamaican governement's request because of the danger to
public health, since the malaria-carrying _Anopheles_ mosquito is
indigenous to Jamaica. See:

Jamaica was declared free from malaria in 1966, but an outbreak with
local transmission started in 2006. 280 confirmed cases of malaria due
to _Plasmodium falciparum_ between 6 Nov 2006 and 3 Feb 2007 were
reported by the WHO
(<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2007_02_09/en/index.html>).

The World Malaria Report 2010 list 22 autochthonous cases of which 17
were _P.falciparum_
<(http://www.who.int/malaria/world_malaria_report_2010/en/index.html>). The
reintroduction of malaria in Jamaica in 2006 demonstrates that there
is a continuous risk of starting new transmission from imported cases.
