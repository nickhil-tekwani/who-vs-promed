Sweden finds no link between H1N1 vaccine and narcolepsy
--------------------------------------------------------
Preliminary results from an investigation by Swedish regulators into
reports of narcolepsy in people who received a 2009 H1N1 vaccine
found no link between the immunization and the condition.

In a report yesterday [8 Sep 2010] from the country's Medical
Products Agency, investigators said they found that narcolepsy
developed both in people who had and who had not received the
vaccine, Finland-based YLE News reported yesterday. The agency's
report said 6 narcolepsy cases in Stockholm were in children, 2 of
whom had not received the Pandemrix vaccine, according to the YLE
report. Of 10 narcolepsy cases reported in adults, half had received
the vaccine. Pandemrix is made by GlaxoSmithKline and contains an
adjuvant. Dr Ville Valtonen, an infectious disease specialist in
Finland, told YLE that respiratory infections with high fever, such
as 2009 H1N1 infections, can trigger narcolepsy.

Despite the findings of Swedish regulators, Finnish officials are
maintaining their recommendation that doctors suspend the use of
Pandemrix, YLE reported. The country's health officials have received
26 reports of suspected narcolepsy, 21 of them in children younger
than 15.

On 27 Aug 2010 Europe's drug regulatory agency launched a review of
Pandemrix in the wake of reports of narcolepsy through Swedish and
Finnish reporting systems. The agency said it would review all the
data and determine the background rate of narcolepsy. It said it
would decide at its meeting this month [September 2010] whether to
take any action on the vaccine while completing its investigation. A
few days later, on 1 Sep 2010, the US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) released a statement on the vaccine-narcolepsy
concerns, noting that Pandemrix, which has been administered to 30.8
million Europeans, has not been licensed in the United States. The
CDC said it reviewed information from the US Vaccine Adverse Event
Reporting System (VAERS) and found no signals or concerns linking the
US pandemic and seasonal flu vaccines to narcolepsy. The agency said
it has enhanced surveillance for narcolepsy cases that occur after
administration of the 2010-11 seasonal flu vaccine, which contains
the 2009 H1N1 virus as one of 3 subtypes.

[Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder marked by excessive sleepiness during
daytime or recurring, uncontrollable episodes of sleep during normal
waking hours, plus sudden episodes of muscle weakness (cataplexy).
Narcolepsy occurs in about 1 in 2000 people (in the US and Europe),
and much lower in some Asian countries. In some cases, the disorder
tends to run in families, but its cause is unknown. Although
narcolepsy has no serious medical consequences, it can be disabling
and increases the risk of accidents. Narcolepsy persists throughout
life but does not affect life expectancy. Symptoms resemble what
happens during REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. The muscle weakness,
sleep paralysis, and hallucinations of narcolepsy resemble the loss
of muscle tone, paralysis, and vivid dreaming that occurs during REM
sleep. For further information see the NINDS (National Institute of
Neurological Disorders and Stroke) website at
