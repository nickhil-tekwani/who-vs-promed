Parasite outbreak strikes more victims; Source still a mystery; city
believes water safe
--------------------
Health authorities said Thursday they still were seeking the source of a
parasitic outbreak in Lawrence as the number of cases continues to rise.
Officials also said they thought the city's water supply was safe from
cryptosporidium -- but admitted they had not yet tested to ensure its
absence from Lawrence drinking water. "We'll probably start testing soon,"
said Shari Stamer, the city's water quality manager. The number of
cryptosporidium cases in Lawrence has increased to 15, up from 11 when the
outbreak was disclosed a week ago today [22 Aug 2003], said Kay Kent,
director of the Lawrence-Douglas County Health Department. There were no
cases reported in Douglas County in 2002. Federal and state health
officials are in Lawrence helping investigate the outbreak.
Students at 4 Lawrence elementary schools Thursday were sent home with
questionnaires designed to help authorities determine how far the disease
has spread -- and whether the outbreak has a common source. "We've had some
anecdotal information that there may be more diarrhea in the community, so
we're really thinking there might be more cases out there," Kent said. She
added: "The truth of the matter is we do not know the source."
More than 2/3 of those who contract cryptosporidiosis are children -- and
Kent said Thursday that 11 of the 15 Lawrence victims were younger than 18.
The parasite is easily passed in swimming pools, because it is able to
survive outside the body for long periods of time and is resistant to
levels of chlorine typically found in pools. In Lawrence, the outbreak was
serious enough for officials to temporarily shut 4 swimming pools for
decontamination.
They were closed from Friday until Sunday, some of the hottest days of the
summer. Kent said Thursday officials had known since late July 2003 that at
least one person with cryptosporidium had been swimming, but they chose not
to take action at the pools until the number of cases grew larger. The
closure orders came after consultation with the federal Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention and the Kansas Department of Health and Environment.
She said there was not a standard number of cases that prompts pool
closures. "One is not it," she said. "But it really had to do with the fact
of the number (of cases), the number that had ... some similar type of
contact."
While the source is unknown, Kent said some suspects were low on the list
of possible causes. Terrorism, for example, is unlikely. "We've asked that
question ourselves," she said. "Just because of the location of the cases
and where they occurred, we don't believe so. But we asked that question --
you always ask that question these days."
Kent said the city's water supply was not suspected. "At this point in
time, we have no reason to believe that the general water supply is
implicated," she said. "We are looking at all risk factors, though." Stamer
said the city was not required to test the water supply for
cryptosporidium, but federal officials were expected to order monthly
testing by 2004. An effective test only recently became available. Other
tests of the system are designed to detect drinking water contamination,
Stamer said.
"Filtration is the barrier for cryptosporidium -- chlorine does not kill
it," she said. "We watch our filter performance, we've done filter
performance testing and that type of thing." Lawrence draws its water from
Clinton Lake and the notoriously dirty Kansas River. Stamer said
cryptosporidium might be lurking in those waters before arriving at the
city's treatment plants. "I can't tell the public it's not out there, at
least in the source water," she said. "It's not a sterile environment, we
know that. Because of how we handle our business here, at the plants, and
how the work is being done, I'm pretty confident the water is safe." City
pools aren't regularly tested for the parasite in Lawrence or elsewhere,
said Jimmy Gibbs, the city's aquatics supervisor. Such tests would cost
upwards of $1000 per sample, he said.
"Right now, there are no basic regulations or standards," Gibbs said. "It's
kind of one of those things that when it does show up, then you react to
it." Kent said city pools on Thursday were tested for the parasite for the
first time. It was not known late Thursday when those test results would be
available. 4 officials from the CDC and one from KDHE have been in Lawrence
this week helping to investigate the source of the outbreak. Questionnaires
went to students of 4 randomly selected schools -- Hillcrest, Prairie Park,
Quail Run, and Sunflower.
The cases do not appear to be centered in any particular neighborhood, Kent
said. "We actually are going to be pinpointing them," she said. "Just
getting addresses at this point; they appear to be scattered throughout"
the city. She said families should return the surveys today, so officials
could analyze the results this weekend. Officials also will conduct phone
interviews with residents in coming weeks. "We will be interviewing the
cases, then, to find out what they've been doing, to find out what the risk
factor is," Kent said. She did not have a target date for completing the
investigation. "It's unusual," Kent said of the outbreak. "So it's very
important to find the source and look at ways to intervene or prevent it."

[It now seems less certain that the source is swimming pools, and the
authorities need to perform some in-depth interviews with cases as well as
tracing other hitherto undiagnosed cases. A case-control analysis
interviewing a random sample of citizens without diarrhea and comparing the
results with the cases may come up with the most likely source. - Mod.EP]
