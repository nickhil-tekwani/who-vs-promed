[2] Encephalitis
Date: Wed 25 Nov 2015
Source: Neurology Advisor [edited]
http://www.neurologyadvisor.com/general-neurology/chikungunya-mosquito-virus-brain-encephalitis/article/456267/

An outbreak of the mosquito-borne chikungunya virus on La Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean that occurred between September 2005 and June 2006 resulted in 57 cases of associated central nervous system disease initiated by encephalitis. This was a highly significant outbreak of a modified strain with more serious outcomes than previous outbreaks of the virus, according to a study published in Neurology [see reference below].

Of the 57 patients studied who had chikungunya virus (CHIKV)- associated central nervous system (CNS) disease, 24 had altered mental status that corresponded to encephalitis according to International Encephalitis Consortium (IEC) criteria, for a regional incidence of 8.6 per 100 000. The burden of the La Reunion outbreak, therefore, was greater than that reported from 1999 - 2007 with the West Nile virus in the U.S. or the worldwide spread of Japanese encephalitis.

The investigators found that the pattern of CHIKV-encephalitis showed a U-shaped distribution, favoring very old and very young people. Of the 57 patients who developed encephalitis, 21 were adults aged 33 - 88 years (mean age = 63.9) and 36 were infants aged 4 days to 5.4 months (mean age = 1.6 months).

Symptoms varied between the age groups: impaired consciousness, coma, focal neurological signs, seizures, and fatal events occurred more frequently among adults, while infants were more likely to display fever prior to hospitalization, skin rash, and behavioral changes.

Infants with CHIKV-associated encephalitis were more likely to survive than adults who were infected. The infants carried higher CHIKV loads than the adults, while protein, glucose, and chloride levels in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) were higher in the adults. All of the infants survived, while 6 adults died during hospitalization from outcomes associated with CHIKV infection. The 8 adults who were discharged continued to experience neurologic consequences, and 1 died 3 months after discharge. The overall death rate for CHIKV-encephalitis was 17 percent, while 35-45 percent of survivors experienced persistent disability.

More than half of the 36 infants who were infected were lost to later follow-up. The remaining 17 infants were re-evaluated at approximately 38 months of age. Of these, 4 children showed impaired neurological development and 1 developed cerebral palsy and blindness. The number of children lost to follow-up was attributed to a milder course of infection.

The investigators concluded that although infants seemed to be more susceptible to CHIKV-encephalitis than older persons, 3-year outcomes were far more likely to be poor among adults infected with the virus (52.6 vs. 18 percent, p = 0.020).

Chikungunya virus-associated encephalitis: A cohort study on La Reunion Island, 2005-2009.

ABSTRACT
Objective: To estimate the cumulative incidence rate (CIR) of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV)-associated CNS disease during the La Reunion outbreak, and assess the disease burden and patient outcome after 3 years.

Methods: CHIKV-associated CNS disease was characterized retrospectively in a cohort of patients with positive CHIKV reverse transcriptase PCR or anti-CHIKV immunoglobulin M antibodies in the CSF and fulfilling International Encephalitis Consortium criteria for encephalitis or encephalopathy. Neurologic sequelae were assessed after 3 years.

Results: Between September 2005 and June 2006, 57 patients were diagnosed with CHIKV-associated CNS disease, including 24 with CHIKV-associated encephalitis, the latter corresponding to a CIR of 8.6 per 100 000 persons. Patients with encephalitis were observed at both extremes of age categories. CIR per 100 000 persons were 187 and 37 in patients below 1 year and over 65 years, respectively, both far superior to those of cumulated causes of encephalitis in the United States in these age categories. The case-fatality rate of CHIKV-associated encephalitis was 16.6 percent and the proportion of children discharged with persistent disabilities estimated 30-45 percent. Beyond the neonatal period, the clinical presentation and outcomes were less severe in infants than in adults.

Conclusions: In the context of a large outbreak, CHIKV is a significant cause of CNS disease. As with other etiologies, CHIKV-associated encephalitis case distribution by age follows a U-shaped parabolic curve.

[3] Vaccine
Date: Tue 24 Nov 2015
Source: EurekAlert [sum. & edited]

An experimental vaccine to protect against the mosquito-borne illness chikungunya is being tested in a Phase 2 trial sponsored by the [US] National Institutes of Health. Results from an initial trial of the vaccine, which was developed by scientists at the NIH National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), were reported in 2014. In that study, all 25 vaccine recipients developed robust immune responses and no safety concerns were noted. The new trial is designed to enroll 400 healthy adult volunteers aged 18 - 60 years at 6 sites in the Caribbean. It will continue to gather data on the candidate vaccine's safety and ability to elicit immune responses, including antibodies.

The hallmark symptoms of chikungunya are severe joint pain accompanied by fever and headache. The pain typically eases after about a week but can persist for months or years in some cases. There are no specific treatments for chikungunya infection and no vaccine to prevent it.

Since its appearance in the Western Hemisphere in late 2013, cases of chikungunya have skyrocketed. So far in 2015, more than 621 000 suspected and confirmed cases have been reported throughout the Americas.

The experimental vaccine, developed by investigators at NIAID's Vaccine Research Center, uses virus-like particles (VLPs) instead of either inactivated or weakened whole virus. VLP vaccines can stimulate immune responses comparable to those resulting from naturally acquired immunity following infection and, because virus is not needed to produce VLP vaccines, they do not need to be prepared in high-level biocontainment facilities.

Eligible volunteers will be randomly assigned to enroll into 1 of 2 groups of 200 people each. Study participants will receive either 2 doses of the candidate vaccine spaced 28 days apart or 2 doses of an inactive placebo. Blood samples will be drawn at multiple time points following the injections to assess whether the candidate vaccine prompted the production of antibodies to chikungunya virus.

Additional details about the trial can be found at ClinicalTrials.gov/ using the identifier NCT02562482.

[These results are very encouraging. However, one wonders if the demand for a CHIK vaccine is sufficiently great to justify the considerable expense of the extensive clinical trials necessary for licensing, or once approved, will it be of low enough cost for individuals or national governments to afford its purchase. - Mod.TY]
