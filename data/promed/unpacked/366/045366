ANTHRAX, ZOO ANIMALS - CANADA (WINNIPEG)

Following a report in the Winnipeg Free Press, I spoke with the Curator,
Dr. Bob Rigley, who confirmed that they had recently lost three bison and
one white tailed deer to anthrax; a cow bison and her calf were noted to be
ill but responded very quickly to treatment with antibiotics. All other
animals & species at risk have now been vaccinated.
The source of the infection is not known. The zoo was established 1904 and
the curator knew of no previous cases in the zoo.
Zoo outbreaks traditionally involve carnivores and scavengers being fed on
dead stock, frequently from surrounding farms. This obviously does not
apply in this case. The bison and deer had been receiving hay and
concentrate nuts.
