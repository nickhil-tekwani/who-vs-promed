Algeria: Outbreak of Conjunctivitis Affects at Least 40 000 in Algiers Area
--------------------------------------------------
Health authorities in Algeria are struggling to cope with an outbreak of
conjunctivitis, a viral infection that causes severe itching under the
eyelid. Reports say up to 40 000 people have been infected over the past
week. Hospitals and health centres in the capital Algiers are being
overwhelmed, as the highly infectious conjunctivitis continues to spread.
"We are drowning with the number of patients that are seeking treatment.
They come from all the districts of Algiers and the surrounding
localities," said a doctor from the Mustapha Pasha hospital. He said the
hospital was receiving up to 800 patients a day -- sometimes whole families
are infected.
Most of the victims come from the Boumerdes area, which was struck by a
massive earthquake in May 2003. Doctors said the spread of the eye
infection was being exacerbated by the poor hygienic conditions that still
prevail in the areas struck by the earthquake. The number of cases recorded
since the outbreak of the infection was first reported on Wed 20 Aug 2003
has reached nearly 40 000. But the authorities say the number could be
higher, because a large number of those infected are seeking treatment in
private health facilities.
To curb the spread of the infection, health authorities have announced that
all those infected will be given free medication in public
hospitals. However, some medical facilities are already reporting they are
running out of medical supplies due to the high demand. They are also
urging the public to exercise high levels of hygiene. Kamel Kellou from the
Ministry of Health said people should avoid shaking hands, while those
already infected should be quarantined. Authorities in Algiers say if the
epidemic is not controlled, it is likely to affect the re-opening of
schools in September.

[The identity of the infectious agent is unclear from this report. Further
information would be welcomed. Conjunctivitis may have many causes, and a
viral etiology cannot be assumed. Adenovirus type 11, coxsackievirus type
A24, and enterovirus type 70 are regularly associated with acute
conjunctivitis, and adenoviruses types 8, 19, and 37 with epidemic
keratoconjunctivitis. Since the conjunctiva and tear ducts are a major
portal of entry for respiratory viruses, other viruses may be implicated,
though less frequently. The occurrence of the outbreak in the aftermath of
a serious earthquake suggests that other factors such as mechanical
abrasion and allergic reactions should also be taken into consideration. -
