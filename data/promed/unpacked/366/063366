Belize fights dengue fever - all 118 cases
--------------------------------------------------------
118 cases of dengue fever have been detected in the capital city, Belmopan
and 10 surrounding villages in the Cayo district: Armenia, Camalote, Cotton
Tree, Las Flores, Ontario, Roaring Creek, Salvapan, San Martin, Unitedville
and Valley of Peace, said a Government Information Service release.
The ministry is now asking the public's help in containing the outbreak by
a cleanup campaign to destroy mosquito breeding sites.
"We call on the public to assist with what we are doing in the Ministry of
Health -- to control the situation by eliminating all potential breeding
sites," said Director of Health Services Dr. Errol Vanzie. "If we control
the breeding sites of mosquitoes, we can avoid dengue."
The public is asked to clean up and remove all containers that collect
water that might serve as a breeding site for mosquitoes. This means burn,
bury or dispose of containers, like old tires and bottles, that can collect
water. Water vats, drums, buckets and all other containers used to collect
water should be covered.
Drums should be washed out at least once a week. The public is also asked
to use insecticide and/or larvicide provided by the health ministry to kill
off the mosquitoes for areas such as ponds or other low-lying areas covered
by water.
Vanzie told Channel 7 News, that destroying all breeding sites does not
mean an end to the outbreak, "there are cases incubating that have not
shown symptoms yet. And even after we've eliminated the mosquitoes, at
least for a week we will still continue to have new cases."
The presence of dengue was confirmed by laboratory analysis in Belize, and
another batch of samples has been sent to laboratories abroad for further
confirmation.
Residents of the above-mentioned villages and neighbouring communities are
asked to report any sudden onset of fever, headache, muscle and joint pain,
rash and pain behind the eyes to their community Nurses Aides, voluntary
collaborators or community leaders who will then report to the hospital
authorities.
Vanzie said anyone who shows any of these signs doesn't need to go to the
clinic. They should drink lots of liquids and rest. Patients with the fever
should be nursed in screened rooms. Tylenol may be taken for the pain,
however, victims should not take any medication that contains aspirin,
because it makes it worse.
He also indicated that cases had also been reported in 6 villages in the
Corozal district as well as Belize City, increasing the chance for the
disease to spread throughout the country and result in a major outbreak.
Classical dengue displays flu-like symptoms. It is self-limiting in the
sense that it comes and goes through its course and within 3 to 4 days it
disappears by itself.
The symptoms are usually pain, generalised pain, especially in the joints,
muscle ache, pain behind the eye (which is very specific to dengue), and a
high percentage of cases will manifest rash.
Vanzie adds that Belize has never had a case of dengue hemorrhagic fever
and, in fact, very few cases have the potential to develop into hemorrhagic
fever.
The Ministry of Health will also be intensifying its spraying operations.
Vector control personnel will also be out applying larvicide to destroy larvae.
Belize is a small country with 250 000 residents.

25 more cases of dengue fever confirmed on St. Croix
---------------------------------------------------
A Health Department epidemiologist said on Tuesday that lab results have
confirmed 25 additional cases of dengue fever in the territory.
The confirmed cases were all from St. Croix, Dr. Eugene Tull said. The
results, which the Health Department received in the last 2 days, were from
blood specimens collected between June 24 and July 6 and sent to a Centers
for Disease Control and Infection lab for processing, Tull said. The
specimens were collected at Luis Hospital.
Of the additional 25 confirmed cases, 22 occurred in people who had had
dengue before, Tull said.
"This indicates that dengue has been very active on St. Croix in the past,"
Tull said.
There are 4 types of the dengue virus, which is transmitted to people
through the bite of an infected mosquito. Someone who has been infected by
one of the strains and has developed immunity to it is still vulnerable to
the other strains.
People who previously have been infected with dengue and are infected again
are at higher risk for developing serious complications, such as dengue
hemorrhagic fever, Tull said.
The figures released Tuesday raise the number of laboratory-confirmed
dengue cases on St. Croix this year to 36.
Tull said on Tuesday that he has yet to compile updated statistics on
suspected and confirmed dengue cases on St. Thomas and St. John. The most
recent information for the district, which the Health Department released
almost a month ago, indicated that 9 dengue cases have been confirmed on
St. Thomas and 3 on St. John.
Tull said updated statistics for St. Thomas and St. John would be available
by the end of the week.
A dramatic increase in reports of suspected dengue on St. Croix followed
publicity surrounding the death of a14-year-old girl from William's Delight
June 18 at Luis Hospital, Tull said. She died from acute dengue shock syndrome.
A statement Health released Monday indicated that more than 200 suspected
cases of dengue [fever] have been reported on St.Croix.
Public concern over the death, combined with the large number of suspected
dengue cases on St. Croix and the fact that many have been clustered in
certain neighborhoods, prompted the Health Department to identify dengue
"hot spots" on St.Croix: William's Delight, Mutual Homes and Aureo Diaz
housing communities, and Estates Barren Spot and Glynn, Tull said.
A statement [the Health Department] released Tuesday night said that
Environmental Health officers receiving training in entomology and
surveillance from 2 CDC biologists on Tuesday morning discovered an
abandoned building in William's Delight where more than 50 tires had been
illegally dumped.
The statement indicated that Health [Department] gave the V.I. Housing
Authority, which is responsible for the community, noticed that it had 2
hours to get rid of the tires. The site had been cleaned by early
afternoon, according to the statement.
No one answered a Daily News call to the Housing Authority on Tuesday
night. The statement did not say what was done with the tires. Discarded
tires, when they fill with water, can provide a fertile breeding ground for
mosquitoes that carry the dengue virus.
Tull, who took the epidemiologist post at Health [Department] in February,
said Tuesday that because the Health Department had not been consistently
collecting dengue fever surveillance information in previous years, he does
not have complete and accurate data to compare with the number of cases
reported this year.
"We're building a surveillance system right now," Tull said. "Next year, we
won't have to be in this situation." Tull said it was not clear whether
there are more cases occurring this year, or whether people experiencing
symptoms are seeking medical help more quickly because of the girl's death.
In October 2004, an infant died of dengue hemorrhagic fever on St. Thomas.
Symptoms of dengue include high fever, joint and muscle pain, severe
headache, backache, rash, eye pain, nausea and vomiting. Treatment includes
rest, fluids and pain relievers.
Tull said that while the Health Department has been consistently getting
reports from both hospitals, health officials continue to suspect that they
are not receiving reports of all suspected dengue cases from private
physicians.
Anyone with symptoms of dengue should consult a physician. Medical
agencies, clinics and private physicians are supposed to report dengue
cases to Tull at 773-1311 ext. 3241.

Philippines issues alarm over dengue in tourist resort Cebu
--------------------------------------------------
The Department of Health (DOH) of the Philippines issued an alarm over the
rise [of] dengue cases in Central Visayas, particularly in several areas in
Cebu province, local newspaper said on Wednesday.
Suzana Madrietta, Central Visayas regional acting director of DOH, said
1298 cases with 26 deaths [CFR or case fatality rate of 2003 per 100 000]
had been reported from Cebu, Bohol, Negros Oriental and Siquijor as of 26
Jul 2005.
The number rose by more than 50 percent compared to the same period of
2004, when only 537 dengue cases with 8 fatalities [CFR of 1490 per 100
000] were reported in the region.
Madrietta said the number of dengue cases "has not yet reached an epidemic
proportion," but "if the incidents continue to rise, then perhaps we may
reach that level."
She added most of the reported cases came from Cebu City and Cebu province,
the place that attracts tourists from around the world.
The number of dengue cases in Cebu City reached 497, followed by Mandaue
City with 77 cases, Talisay City with 71 cases, Lapulapu City 51 cases and
Toledo 45 cases.
Madrietta said the government has launched a campaign to teach residents in
the communities how to eliminate the breeding grounds of dengue-causing
mosquitoes.
Dengue is an acute, infectious tropical disease caused by an arbovirus
transmitted by mosquitoes, and characterized by high fever, rash, headache,
severe muscle and joint pain and possible death.

8 cases of suspected dengue have been reported in Rajkot
--------------------------------------------------
To beat the dengue bug, RMC has a brainwave: cover up
RMC [the Rajkot Municipal Corporation] asks housing societies to pitch in.
In a precautionary measure against dengue, RMC has asked school authorities
to instruct students to wear dresses covering their hands and legs, even as
8 schools were given notice to remove water logging and leaking after
_Aedes aegypti_ larvae was found in their water reservoirs.
A total of 8 cases of suspected dengue have been reported in Rajkot so far.
Larvae were also found at 16 places in Rajkot on Thursday.
According to RMC Commissioner Mukesh Kumar, all schools have been asked to
see that students wear dresses that cover their hands and legs. School
authorities have also been asked [relax dress codes]. Besides, Mukesh Kumar
also contacted the presidents of various housing societies, architects and
builders to join hands in anti-dengue drive.
The RMC health department has said that more _Aedes aegypti_ breeding sites
were found at in the old as well as new city areas.
According to the health department, it has also started a door-to-door
campaign to take blood tests of those suffering from fever.
Meanwhile, Gujarat High Court on Wednesday took suo motu cognisance of the
rising number of dengue cases in Ahmedabad and ordered the formation of 3
committees, under the registrar-general of the high court, to inspect
affected areas under the jurisdiction of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation
(AMC) and Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority (AUDA).
A division bench of K R Vyas and A K Mehta has directed the committees to
visit areas and find whether local authorities have adhered to provisions
of municipal law pertaining to public health. The committees have also been
asked to photograph or videograph and draw panchnamas [file reports or
affidavits] of affected areas and people to uncover the causes behind the
outbreak.
The committees have also been asked to look into instances of negligence in
cleaning garbage and waterlogging and report to the high court.
