15 kidney dialysis patients were infected with hepatitis C at a
hospital in China's Anhui Province, authorities said. The patients
were infected at Yicheng Hospital, which opened an investigation last
month [December 2009] after several patients with renal issues were
diagnosed with the disease. 39 of 77 dialysis patients treated at the
hospital were found to have hepatitis C, but only 15 cases could be
linked to the hospital's dialysis clinic, Xinhua, China's state-run
news agency, reported on Wednesday [6 Jan 2010].

"There's a chance that some of the patients may have had the disease
before taking the dialysis treatment," an unidentified health
official told Xinhua. Patients confirmed to have contracted hepatitis
at the hospital would receive free treatment, the spokesman said.

[This report is ambiguous. It may be that the patients with hepatitis
C virus infection were being treated in the hospital as a consequence
of their infection and none acquired their infection in the hospital.
It is unclear why 15 of the 39 hepatitis C virus infected dialysis
patients are considered to have acquired their infection in the
dialysis clinic. Clarification would be welcomed.
