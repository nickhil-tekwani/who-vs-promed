[1] Omicron: origin
Date: Fri 28 Jan 2022
Source: Nature [edited]

Where did omicron come from? Three key theories
-----------------------------------------------
Little more than 2 months after it was first spotted in South Africa, the omicron variant of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has spread around the world faster than any previous versions. Scientists have tracked it in more than 120 countries, but remain puzzled by a key question: where did omicron come from?

There's no transparent path of transmission linking omicron to its predecessors. Instead, the variant has an unusual array of mutations, which it evolved entirely outside the view of researchers. Omicron is so different from earlier variants, such as alpha and delta, that evolutionary virologists estimate its closest-known genetic ancestor probably dates back to more than a year ago, some time after mid-2020.(1) "It just came out of nowhere," says Darren Martin, a computational biologist at the University of Cape Town, South Africa.

The question of omicron's origins is of more than academic importance. Working out under what conditions this highly transmissible variant arose might help scientists to understand the risk of new variants emerging, and suggest steps to minimize it, says Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization in Saskatoon, Canada. "It's very difficult to try to mitigate a risk that you can't even remotely wrap your head around," she says.

The World Health Organization's recently formed Scientific Advisory Group for the Origins of Novel Pathogens (SAGO) met in January [2022] to discuss omicron's origins. The group is expected to release a report in early February [2022], according to Marietjie Venter, a medical virologist at the University of Pretoria in South Africa, who chairs SAGO.

Ahead of that report, scientists are investigating 3 theories. Although researchers have sequenced millions of SARS-CoV-2 genomes, they might simply have missed a series of mutations that eventually led to omicron. Alternatively, the variant might have evolved mutations in one person, as part of a long-term infection. Or it could have emerged unseen in other animal hosts, such as mice or rats.

For now, whichever idea a researcher favours "often comes down to gut feeling rather than any sort of principled argument", says Richard Neher, a computational biologist at the University of Basel in Switzerland. "They are all fair game," says Jinal Bhiman, a medical scientist at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in Johannesburg, South Africa. "Everyone has their favourite hypothesis."

Craziest genome
---------------
Researchers agree that omicron is a recent arrival. It was first detected in South Africa and Botswana in early November 2021 (see 'Omicron takeover'); retrospective testing has since found earlier samples from individuals in England on [1 and 3 Nov 2021], and in South Africa, Nigeria and the United States on [2 Nov 2021]. An analysis of the mutation rate in hundreds of sequenced genomes, and of how quickly the virus had spread through populations by December [2021], dates its emergence to not long before that -- around the end of September or early October last year [2021].(2) In southern Africa, omicron probably spread from the dense urban province of Gauteng, between Johannesburg and Pretoria, to other provinces and to neighbouring Botswana.

But because Johannesburg is home to the largest airport on the African continent, the variant could have emerged anywhere in the world -- merely being picked up in South Africa because of the country's sophisticated genetic surveillance, says Tulio de Oliveira, a bioinformatician at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban and at Stellenbosch University's Centre for Epidemic Response and Innovation, who has led South Africa's efforts to track viral variants, including omicron.

What stands out about omicron is its remarkable number of mutations. Martin heard about it when he took a phone call from de Oliveira, who asked him to look at the craziest SARS-CoV-2 genome he had ever seen. The variant has more than 50 mutations when compared with the original SARS-CoV-2 virus isolated in Wuhan, China (see <go.nature.com/32utxva>). Some 30 of these contribute to changes in amino acids in the spike protein,(1) which the coronavirus uses to attach to and fuse with cells. Previous variants of concern have had no more than 10 such spike mutations. "That is a hell of a lot of changes," says Neher (see 'Most mutated').

Researchers have seen many of these mutations before. Some were previously known to give the virus an increased ability to bind to the ACE2 receptor protein -- which adorns host cells and is the docking point for SARS-CoV-2 -- or to help it evade the body's immune system. Omicron forms a stronger grip on ACE2 than do previously seen variants.(3) It is also better at evading the virus-blocking 'neutralizing' antibodies(4) produced by people who have been vaccinated, or who have been infected with earlier variants. Other changes in the spike protein seem to have modified how omicron enters cells: it appears to be less adept at fusing directly with the cell's membrane, and instead tends to gain entry after being engulfed in an endosome (a lipid-surrounded bubble).(3)

But more than a dozen of omicron's mutations are extremely rare: some have not been seen at all before, and others have popped up but disappeared again quickly, presumably because they gave the virus a disadvantage.(1)

Another curious feature of omicron is that, from a genomic viewpoint, it consists of 3 distinct sublineages (called BA.1, BA.2 and BA.3) that all seem to have emerged at around the same time -- 2 of which have taken off globally. That means omicron had time to diversify before scientists noticed it. Any theory about its origins has to take this feature into account, as well as the number of mutations, notes Joel Wertheim, a molecular epidemiologist at the University of California, San Diego.

Silent spread
-------------
Researchers have explained the emergence of previous variants of concern through a simple process of gradual evolution. As SARS-CoV-2 replicates and transmits from person to person, random changes crop up in its RNA sequence, some of which persist. Scientists have observed that, in a given lineage, about 1 or 2 single-letter mutations a month make it into the general viral circulation -- a mutation rate about half that of influenza. It is also possible for chunks of coronavirus genomes to shuffle and recombine wholesale, adds Kristian Andersen, an infectious-disease researcher at Scripps Research in La Jolla, California. And viruses can evolve faster when there is selection pressure, he says, because mutations are more likely to stick around if they give the virus an increased ability to propagate under certain environmental conditions. ...

Chronic infection
-----------------
An alternative incubator for fast-paced evolution is a person with a chronic infection. There, the virus can multiply for weeks or months, and different types of mutation can emerge to dodge the body's immune system. Chronic infections give the virus "the opportunity to play cat and mouse with the immune system", says Pond, who thinks it is a plausible hypothesis for omicron's emergence. Such chronic infections have been observed in people with compromised immune systems who cannot easily get rid of SARS-CoV-2. ...

Mouse or rat
------------
Omicron might not have emerged in a person at all. SARS-CoV-2 is a promiscuous virus: it has spread to a wild leopard, to hyenas and hippopotamuses at zoos, and into pet ferrets and hamsters. It has caused havoc in mink farms across Europe, and has infiltrated populations of white-tailed deer throughout North America. And omicron might be able to enter a broader selection of animals. Cell-based studies have found that, unlike earlier variants, omicron's spike protein can bind to the ACE2 protein of turkeys, chickens and mice.(3,7)

One study found that the N501Y-Q498R combination of mutations allows variants to bind tightly to rat ACE2.(6) And Robert Garry, a virologist at Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana, notes that several other mutations in omicron have been seen in SARS-CoV-2 viruses adapting to rodents in laboratory experiments. ...

In the dark
-----------
...The answer to omicron's emergence will probably be one or a combination of the 3 scenarios, says Bloom. But, he adds, researchers are far from explaining the processes that brought omicron here, let alone predicting what the next variant will look like. And many scientists say they might never find out where omicron came from. "Omicron really shows us the need for humility in thinking about our ability to understand the processes that are shaping the evolution of viruses like SARS-CoV-2," says Bloom.

Abstract
--------
Introduction
Immunoassays targeting different SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies are employed for seroprevalence studies. The degree of variability between immunoassays targeting anti-nucleocapsid (anti-NP; the majority) vs the potentially neutralising anti-spike antibodies (including anti-receptor-binding domain; anti-RBD), particularly in mild or asymptomatic disease, remains unclear.

Aims
We aimed to explore variability in anti-NP and anti-RBD antibody detectability following mild symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and analyse antibody response for correlation with symptomatology.

Methods
A multicentre prospective cross-sectional study was undertaken (April-July 2020). Paired serum samples were tested for anti-NP and anti-RBD IgG antibodies and reactivity expressed as binding ratios (BR). Multivariate linear regression was performed analysing age, sex, time since onset, symptomatology, anti-NP and anti-RBD antibody BR.

Results
We included 906 adults. Antibody results (793/906; 87.5%; 95% confidence interval: 85.2-89.6) and BR strongly correlated (ρ = 0.75). PCR-confirmed cases were more frequently identified by anti-RBD (129/130) than anti-NP (123/130). Anti-RBD testing identified 83 of 325 (25.5%) cases otherwise reported as negative for anti-NP. Anti-NP presence (+1.75/unit increase; p < 0.001), fever (≥ 38°C; +1.81; p < 0.001) or anosmia (+1.91; p < 0.001) were significantly associated with increased anti-RBD BR. Age (p = 0.85), sex (p = 0.28) and cough (p = 0.35) were not. When time since symptom onset was considered, we did not observe a significant change in anti-RBD BR (p = 0.95) but did note decreasing anti-NP BR (p < 0.001).

Conclusion
SARS-CoV-2 anti-RBD IgG showed significant correlation with anti-NP IgG for absolute seroconversion and BR. Higher BR were seen in symptomatic individuals, particularly those with fever. Inter-assay variability (12.5%) was evident and raises considerations for optimising seroprevalence testing strategies/studies.

Final Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 anti-RBD IgG antibody, using an in-house assay, showed a significant but not absolute correlation with the Abbott anti-NP antibody reactivity expressed as BR. Higher reactivity was seen in those with fever and anosmia; in contrast, cough appeared to have no effect on anti-RBD BR. Observed inter-assay variability may have implications for population-based seroprevalence and longitudinal studies. Discordance between assays appeared more apparent as time progressed from symptom onset and in those with low BR following asymptomatic infection. As anti-NP assays utilise a non-neutralising antibody, the observed discordance could limit their use for any future interpretation of anti-NP results alone if neutralising antibodies are correlated with inferred immunity. Further work comparing a range of commercial and research assays will allow for further characterisation of the dynamics associated with inter-assay variability.

COVID-19 tracker: World hits 10B COVID shots administered; serious inflammatory post-COVID illness much more prevalent in unvaccinated kids
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As of Friday [27 Jan 2022], 10 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses have been administered around the world, according to the Our World in Data project at Oxford.

Unvaccinated children who contract COVID-19 are much more susceptible to multi-system inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C), a serious condition associated with COVID-19, according to an Epic Research study.

The worldwide case count has come close to 367 million as of Friday afternoon [27 Jan 2022], with 5.6 million reported deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University's COVID-19 dashboard. [https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6]

UPDATED: Fri 28 Jan 2022
As of Friday [28 Jan 2022], the world has reached the 10 billion mark in vaccinations administered according to the Our World in Data project at the University of Oxford. But that total obscures lots of disparity among the world's 7.9 billion people. In some low-income countries, less than 10% of the population have received one dose. "Ten billion doses is a triumph of science but a complete failure of global solidarity," Madhukar Pai, a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at McGill University in Montreal, told the New York Times.

Of children hospitalized with multi-system inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C), a serious condition associated with COVID-19, 98% were unvaccinated, according to a study from Epic Research. The study revealed that unvaccinated children with mild COVID-19 symptoms were more at risk for MIS-C. Of the 1499 pediatric hospitalizations for MIS-C, 1474 (98%) were unvaccinated. This is a factor as the FDA considers approving Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine for children 4 and younger. [https://epicresearch.org/articles/98-of-mis-c-hospitalizations-were-unvaccinated-pediatric-patients]

The newly discovered subvariant of omicron, BA.2, has a greater growth rate than the original version, and transmission in households is likely to be higher, said the U.K. Health Security Agency. There is no indication yet that vaccines would offer any less protection against symptomatic disease from BA.2 than the original omicron variant. The organization warned that data this early in the cycle of a variant are unreliable.

Six preclinical lab studies show that Merck and Ridgeback's oral antiviral, molnupiravir, is active against the omicron variant of COVID-19. The studies were conducted independently in the U.S., Belgium, Czech Republic, Germany, Poland and the Netherlands. The findings provide additional "confidence in the potential of molnupiravir" to treat high-risk individuals with mild-to-moderate COVID-19, Merck Research Laboratories chief Dean Li, said in a release. [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/merck-ridgeback-molnupiravir-investigational-oral-114500209.html]

Walvax Biotechnology of China has recruited most of the 28 000 needed in a trial of the country's first mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. The study has taken on urgency, as the 2 vaccines in use in China -- produced by Sinopharm and Sinovac -- have shown to be ineffective against the omicron variant. The country has not imported mRNA vaccines. Walvax has the potential to produce the bulk substance for 400 million vaccines a year and is working to secure more capacity, the company said. [https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/chinas-walvax-says-most-participants-150722147.html]

UPDATED: Thu 27 Jan 2022
The European Medicines Agency has conditionally approved the use of Pfizer's COVID-19 antiviral pill, Paxlovid, for those with the virus who do not require oxygen and are at risk to progressing to a severe form of the disease. A decision on Merck's oral antiviral, molnupiravir, is expected early next month [February 2022]. The U.S. approved use of the treatment in December [2021]. [https://www.aa.com.tr/en/europe/eu-regulator-conditionally-approves-pfizers-covid-19-pill/2487479]

The U.S.' top infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said that when the Pfizer vaccine is approved for children ages 4 and younger, it likely will require a 3-shot series. During the White House press briefing, coronavirus response coordinator Jeff Zients added that the supply of Pfizer's antiviral COVID-19 pill will increase over the next few months and will become more plentiful by June [2022]. [https://nypost.com/2022/01/26/kids-under-4-will-get-3-doses-of-covid-19-vaccine-fauci/]

A study measuring the risk of carditis associated with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, Comirnaty, showed that a 2nd dose of the shot can raise the risk of the heart inflammation disorder, albeit very slightly, according to a study at the University of Hong Kong. In comparison, Sinovac's vaccine showed an incidence of 0.31 cases out of 100 000 versus an incidence of 0.57 per 100 000 cases for the Pfizer shot. The study was written up in the Annals of Internal Medicine. [https://consumer.healthday.com/risk-of-carditis-tied-to-second-dose-of-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-2656462506.html] ...

World's brightest x-rays reveal COVID-19's damage to the body
-------------------------------------------------------------
Tafforeau and Walsh are part of an international team of more than 30 researchers that has created a powerful new kind of x-ray scan called hierarchical phase-contrast tomography (HiP-CT). With it, they can finally go from a complete human organ to a zoomed-in view of the body's tiniest blood vessels and even individual cells.

The technique is already providing fresh insights into how COVID-19 damages and reshapes the blood vessels of the lungs. And while its long-term promise is hard to define, because nothing quite like HiP-CT has ever existed before, researchers excited by its potential are enthusiastically dreaming up new ways to understand disease and more rigorously chart the terrains of human anatomy.

A global total of 11 182 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 27 Jan 2022 to late 28 Jan 2022). The exponential rise in cases over the last few weeks can be attributed to the rapid spread of the omicron variant globally. The 7-day averages indicate an increasing global trend for cases and deaths.

A total of 93 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 45 of the 93 countries are from the European region, 17 are from the Americas region, 15 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 8 are from the Western Pacific region, 6 from the South-East Asia region, and 2 are from the African region.
