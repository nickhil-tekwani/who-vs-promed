Measles control in Krasnoyarsk
------------------------------
So far this year [2011], 9 laboratory confirmed cases of measles have
been recorded in Krasnoyarsk. The vice-mayor of the city summoned a
meeting with the municipal public health authorities to discuss the
situation. The mayor's office stated that a widespread epidemic had
been avoided because 95 per cent vaccine coverage of both children and
the 18-35 year age group had been achieved. Coverage of the migrant
population remains a problem, with immunization coverage reaching no
more than 53 per cent of the population.

Immunization of the 18-35 year old age group is expected to be
completed by Mon 31 Jan 2011. Currently public health workers are
operating in the 14 biggest markets in the city in an attempt to
increase vaccine uptake among in the immigrant population of the city.
The vice-mayor reaffirmed that immunization is the only feasible means
of preventing measles and that it has to be comprehensive to succeed.

[Krasnoyarsk city is the administrative centre of Krasnoyarsk Krai
(territory). It is located on the Yenisey River and is the 3rd largest
city in Siberia. It has a population of around 950 000. Krasnoyarsk
city is an important junction of the Trans-Siberian Railway. By virtue
of its location and economy Krasnoyarsk is likely to attract migrants.
As elsewhere in Europe migrants present a continuing problem in
attempts to eradicate measles virus infection by vaccination, despite
the existence and wide deployment of an inexpensive and effective
vaccine.
