Global study notes risk factors for uncommon severe COVID-19 in kids
--------------------------------------------------------------------
A 10-country study of more than 3000 children who tested positive for COVID-19 in emergency departments (EDs) finds that 3% went on to develop severe disease within 2 weeks, with risk factors being older age, having chronic conditions, and experiencing symptoms longer.

The study was published yesterday [11 Jan 2022] in JAMA Network Open. [Anna L. Funk, Todd A. Florin, Nathan Kuppermann, et al. Outcomes of SARS-CoV-2-Positive Youths Tested in Emergency Departments. The Global PERN-COVID-19 Study. JAMA Netw Open. 2022;5(1):e2142322. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.42322]

An international group of scientists report that, among 3221 children 17 years and younger studied in Argentina, Australia, Canada, Costa Rica, Italy, New Zealand, Paraguay, Singapore, Spain, and the United States, 107 (3.3%) experienced severe outcomes within 2 weeks, and 4 (0.12%) died. Among children discharged home from the ED, the risk was much lower.

The children had visited an ED from [7 Mar 2020 to 15 Jun 2021], a span that mostly predated the delta variant (B1617.2) and well before the current omicron (B.1.1.529) variant was detected.

"Fortunately, the risk of developing severe disease in children with COVID-19 discharged from the emergency department is very low," study co-lead author Todd Florin, MD, an associate professor of pediatrics at Northwestern University, said in a University of Calgary news release. "Our findings can provide reassurance to parents and clinicians for children well enough to be managed in the community, while also providing important insights on which children may be at particular risk for severe outcomes." [EurekAlert https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/939824]

Asthma not found as a risk factor
---------------------------------
Of the 3221 children treated at one of 41 EDs, 2007 (62.3%) were from the United States, 1694 (52.6%) were male, and 484 (15.0%) had a self-reported chronic illness. They tended to be young, with a median age of 3 years.

After 14 days of follow-up, 735 children (22.8%) were hospitalized, 107 (3.3%) had severe outcomes, and 4 (0.12%) died. The researchers used a composite measure to define severe outcomes that included intensive interventions during hospitalization, such as positive-pressure ventilation; diagnoses that indicated severe organ impairment; and death.

Characteristics associated with severe outcomes included being aged 5-9 years (odds ratio [OR], 1.60 compared with kids younger than 1 year), being age 10-17 (OR, 2.39), having a self-reported chronic illness (OR, 2.34), prior episode of pneumonia (OR, 3.15), symptoms starting 4-7 days prior to seeking ED care (vs starting 0-3 days before seeking care: OR, 2.22), and country (e.g., Canada vs US: OR, 0.11; Costa Rica vs US: OR, 1.76; Spain vs US: OR, 0.51).

The study authors wrote, "Although asthma has been suggested as a risk factor for severe illness in youths with COVID-19, our study, as well as a registry-based study in the United States, did not confirm this association."

Among the 2510 kids discharged home from the ED after initial testing and who had complete follow-up, 50 (2.0%) were eventually hospitalized and 12 (0.5%) had severe outcomes.

When compared with hospitalized children who tested negative for COVID-19, the risk of severe outcomes was higher among hospitalized COVID-positive patients, with a risk difference of 3.9% (95% confidence interval, 1.1% to 6.9%).

The authors note, "Because participating EDs were located in academic pediatric institutions, we cannot generalize our results to all community EDs nor can we generalize to countries beyond those included in our analysis."

"There are no specific evidence-based treatments and therapies for children at this time, and detailed research data describing outcomes in young people with COVID-19 has been lacking, so this study offers important insights that we believe will be helpful to front-line care providers treating children with COVID-19," said co-senior author Stephen Freedman, MD, a pediatrician at the University of Calgary, in the news release.

US COVID vaccination may have saved 240 000 lives in first 6 months
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The US COVID-19 vaccination program may have averted 14 million infections, saved more than 240 000 lives, and prevented upwards of 1.1 million hospitalizations in the first half of 2021, according to estimates from a modeling study yesterday [11 Jan 2022] in JAMA Network Open.

Led by York University scientists in Toronto, the research team simulated the pandemic trajectory under two scenarios: no vaccinations and a program that reached only half the actual daily vaccination rate. Total infections, hospitalizations, and deaths under each scenario from [12 Dec 2020 to 30 Jun 2021], were compared with simulated trends under US vaccination campaigns.

The researchers didn't consider waning vaccine immunity or recovery from COVID-19 in their estimations.

Relative to the no-vaccination scenario, the actual US vaccination campaign prevented upwards of 14 million COVID-19 infections, saved an estimated 240 797 lives (95% credible interval [CrI], 200 665 to 281 230), and prevented 1 133 617 hospitalizations (95% CrI, 967 487 to 1 301 881).

COVID-19 vaccination may have also averted a wave of infections driven by the alpha (B117) variant in April 2021. The wave was projected to have led to 4409 deaths (95% CrI, 2865 to 6312) and 17 979 hospitalizations (95% CrI, 13 191 to 23 219).

Under the scenario of daily vaccination rates of half that of the reported rate, another 77 283 (95% CrI, 48 499 to 104 519) deaths may have occurred, along with 336 000 more hospitalizations (95% CrI, 225 330 to 440 109).

"Our analytical model suggested that the US COVID-19 vaccination program was associated with a reduction in the total hospitalizations and deaths by nearly half during the first 6 months of 2021," the researchers wrote.

"As new variants of SARS-CoV-2 continue to emerge, a renewed commitment to vaccine access, particularly among underserved groups and in counties with low vaccination coverage, will be crucial to preventing avoidable COVID-19 cases and bringing the pandemic to a close."

Researchers develop wearable air sampler to detect COVID-19 exposure
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Yale University researchers have developed a wearable passive air sampler to monitor personal exposure to COVID-19, they reported yesterday [11 Jan 2022] in Environmental Science & Technology Letters.

The polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based air sampler, the Fresh Air Clip, continually monitors exposure to virus-containing aerosols, which could prove helpful to workers in high-risk settings such as healthcare. While active indoor air sampling devices are available, they are usually large, expensive, and nonportable, and they require electricity, the authors noted. Passive samplers, however, can be small, lightweight, portable, and inexpensive.

The researchers tested the air sampler in a rotating drum containing aerosols laden with a surrogate virus similar to SARS-CoV-2. They found virus in the sampler through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, demonstrating its ability to estimate airborne virus levels.

When 62 volunteers wore the samplers for 5 days, PCR detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 5 (8%) of them, 4 of them worn by restaurant servers and 1 by a homeless shelter worker. The highest viral loads (more than 100 RNA copies per clip) were found in 2 clips worn by restaurant servers.

While the Fresh Air Clip hasn't been commercialized, the study authors said it could be used as a semiquantitative screening tool for monitoring personal COVID-19 exposure and as a way to identify high-risk areas for indoor exposure.

"Our findings demonstrate that PDMS-based passive samplers may serve as a useful exposure assessment tool for airborne viral exposure in real-world high-risk settings and provide avenues for early detection of potential cases and guidance on site-specific infection control protocols that preempt community transmission," they wrote.

[This air sampler would be useful for teachers to wear in classrooms to determine exposure to virus aerosols. Similarly, such devices would also be useful in any close indoor space such as theatres, concert halls. Highly positive results would suggest strong air filtration is needed to protect students and teachers. - Mod.LK]

[3] What lies ahead
Date: Tue 11 Jan 2022

One of the most indelible -- and ultimately telling -- moments of the early coronavirus pandemic came in late February 2020. A top official at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that the spread of the virus was "inevitable."

"It's not a question of if this will happen, but when this will happen, and how many people in this country will have severe illnesses," Nancy Messonnier said. The comment caused a blowup at the White House and among top administration officials, who had to account for President Donald Trump's consistent desire to downplay the threat during his reelection campaign. Then-Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar would later acknowledge that Messonnier had been "right."

On Tuesday [11 Jan 2022], nearly 2 years later, came another such plainly stated and significant warning of what lies ahead in the pandemic: for most people, an infection.

"I think it's hard to process what's actually happening right now," said Janet Woodcock, acting commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, "which is most people are going to get COVID."

Woodcock pitched this as being a necessary acknowledgment when it comes to charting the path forward -- recognizing that the focus now needs to be on averting the worst that widespread infections could bring in the near term.

"What we need to do is make sure the hospitals can still function, transportation, you know, other essential services are not disrupted while this happens," she said. "I think after that will be a good time to reassess how we're approaching this pandemic."

Woodcock's projection might not be terribly surprising, given the number of daily positive tests rising to record levels. On Monday [10 Jan 2022], the 7-day average reached more than 760 000, meaning about 1 in every 60 Americans has tested positive in the last week alone. (And that's probably a significant undercount, given the mildness of many omicron cases and the availability of at-home tests.) A study released about 4 months ago -- before the rise of the unprecedentedly infectious omicron variant -- estimated that 31% of the U.S. population had already been infected even by that point.

Woodcock's comment also came shortly after a World Health Organization official warned the same day [11 Jan 2022] that Europe could see more than 50% of its population infected over the next 6-8 weeks.

But as with Messonnier's comment, the acknowledgment is a momentous one in the fight against the virus. There has been some hope that omicron could spike and fade relatively quickly -- as it appears to have in South Africa. But Senator Richard Burr (N.C.), the ranking Republican on the Senate Health Committee, which hosted Woodcock and other health officials, noted Israeli scientists were less bullish that their country would be following the same trajectory.

In responding to Burr's comments about South Africa, Anthony S. Fauci added another reality check, warning of inevitable future variants and that omicron infections might not provide natural immunity against them.

"If we wind up getting infected with omicron at a very, very low level of pathogenicity, is that going to be sort of almost like a live attenuated vaccine? I don't think we can say that right now," Fauci said.

Fauci added: "We really have to see how things spread out, when we see how that fares in the next variant. So there will be invariably another variant; we're going to have to take a look at whether or not there's going to be any protection there."

Even as they warned about the peril that lay ahead and the likelihood of infection for many Americans, Woodcock, Fauci and the others were careful to emphasize the importance of preventing infections as much as possible, given the strain widespread infection could put on hospitals and essential services.

Woodcock also repeatedly seemed to argue for a new footing in the fight against the virus: one that acknowledges what lies ahead in the near term and deals with institutional changes later on.

Senator Mike Braun (R-Ind.) later in the hearing cited a Washington Post editorial arguing for a change in approach to the pandemic from the administration. Braun compared the situation to a business at which high-ranking officials might be fired and things would be decentralized. [https://tinyurl.com/2pb32vmb]

"I think that we're talking about a natural disaster, and you can fire your board of directors because your factory was devastated by a hurricane, a tornado or a wildfire," Woodcock said. "But I don't know whether that would improve this situation."

Woodcock added: "I think right now we need to focus on continuity of operations for hospitals and other essential services as this variant sweeps through the population. I don't think that will last a really long time, but that's where I think we are right now."

[For those who wish to see the detailed global data, a snapshot of the Worldometer table at the time we accessed it is available at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/2022%20WORLDDATA%20JAN12_1642105904.pdf.

A 7-day series of cumulative data reported by countries, territories, and reporting entities can be found at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/2022%20JAN12WORLD7_1642105916.pdf.

In the past 24 hours, 35 countries including the USA (953 818), France (361 719), Italy (196 025), India (241 976), Spain (179 125), Argentina (131 082), the UK (129 544), Australia (153 850), Turkey (77 722), Brazil (88 464), Sweden (21 939), Israel (47 073), Germany (80 542), Mexico (44 187), Portugal (40 945), Switzerland (32 804), Greece (24 245), Vietnam (28 291), Canada (32 577), The Netherlands (32 043), Philippines (32 161), Sweden (22 949), Colombia (29 857), Denmark (22 729), Bolivia (14 063), Ireland (20 909), Russia (17 946), Serbia (12 877), Japan (13 223), Austria (17 006), Poland (16 173), Czech Republic (12 413), and Norway (11 825) reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases.

A global total of 8829 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 10 Jan 2022 to late 11 Jan 2022). The exponential rise in cases over the last few weeks can be attributed to the rapid spread of the omicron variant globally. The 7-day averages indicate an increasing global trend for cases and deaths.

A total of 72 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 38 of the 72 countries are from the European region, 9 are from the Americas region, 5 are from the Western Pacific region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 3 from the South East Asia region, and 11 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 44.4%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 10.5%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 33.5% increase in daily reported cases and a 42.1% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 3.3 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with more than 317.54 million cumulative reported cases and over 5.53 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA
