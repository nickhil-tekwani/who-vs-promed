A case of equine infectious anemia (EIA) has been confirmed in a 2-month-old foal from Rhineland-Palatinate. All equines from the holding and surrounding farms tested negative for the virus, including the mother of the foal.

Investigations are underway to establish how the foal became infected. It was born on the holding but had been transported earlier to a horse clinic in North Rhine-Westphalia twice for conditions that are not related to EIA.

Tracing of contact horses is under way.

[EIA recurred in Germany in September 2006, after its absence since June 2002. The number of reported outbreaks (infected sites) since 2006, as reported to the OIE, was as follows:
2006 - 7; 2007 - 2; 2008 - 10; 2009 - 4; 2010 - 27; 2011 - 5.

The countrywide spread of EIA during 2010-2011, shared with other EU member countries, was attributed to introduction of infected horses from Romania. Results of the epidemiological investigation of the current outbreak are anticipated.

EIA is not zoonotic. For an updated review, see http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/equine_infectious_anemia.pdf. - Mod.AS
