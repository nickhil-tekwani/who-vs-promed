Background
----------
Chikungunya [CHIKV] and dengue [DENV] viruses emerged in Gabon in 2007, with large outbreaks primarily affecting the capital Libreville and several northern towns. Both viruses subsequently spread to the south-east of the country, with new outbreaks occurring in 2010. The mosquito species _Aedes albopictus_, that was known as a secondary vector for both viruses, recently invaded the country and was the primary vector involved in the Gabonese outbreaks. We conducted a retrospective study of human sera and mosquitoes collected in Gabon from 2007 to 2010, in order to identify other circulating arboviruses.


--------------
Not previously considered an important human arboviral pathogen, the epidemic capacity of Zika virus (ZIKV, a dengue-related flavivirus) was revealed by the Micronesia outbreak in 2007, which affected about 5000 persons. Widely distributed throughout tropical areas of Asia and Africa, ZIKV is transmitted by a broad range of mosquito species, most of which are sylvatic or rural, _Aedes aegypti_, an anthropophilic and urban species, being considered the main ZIKV epidemic vector.

In a context of emerging arbovirus infections (CHIKV and DENV) in Gabon since 2007, we conducted a retrospective study to detect other, related viruses. In samples collected during the concurrent CHIKV/DENV outbreaks that occurred in the capital city in 2007, we detected ZIKV in both humans and mosquitoes, and notably the Asian mosquito _Aedes albopictus_ that recently invaded the country and was the main vector responsible for these outbreaks. We found that the Gabonese ZIKV strain belonged to the African lineage, and phylogenetic analysis suggested ancestral diversification and spread rather than recent introduction.

These findings, showing for the 1st time epidemic ZIKV activity in an urban environment in Central Africa and the presence of ZIKV in the invasive mosquito _Aedes albopictus_, raise the possibility of a new emerging threat to human health.

[This is the 1st report of an outbreak of Zika virus infections that ProMED-mail has posted for Gabon. It is interesting that an invasive mosquito vector, in this instance _Aedes albopictus_, increased an endemic virus, ZIKV, to an outbreak situation. This invasive mosquito is proving to be a public health problem in various parts of the world because of its capacity to transmit a variety of important arthropod-borne viruses. Zika virus has been spreading recently, with outbreaks in New Caledonia and French Polynesia [see ProMED archives below].
