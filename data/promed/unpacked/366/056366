Farms' Movements Restricted Amid Brucellosis Fears
-----------------------------------------------------
Movement restrictions have been placed on 8 neighbouring farms after
an outbreak of a "serious" cattle disease, it was announced today.
Preliminary tests have shown that 6 animals from a 38-strong beef
suckler herd, near Liskeard, Cornwall, may have brucellosis, which
causes abortions in cattle.
The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs [DEFRA]
described the move as "precautionary".
Brucellosis is caused by infection with the bacterium _Brucella
abortus_, but it can also cause a disease of humans known as undulant
fever.
Defra said while the disease was "serious, it is not nearly as
serious as foot and mouth disease," which crippled the industry 3
years ago.

Defra Confirms Brucellosis on Farm in Cornwall;
Movement Restrictions on 7 Neighbouring Farms
---------------------------------------------------
Defra has imposed movement restrictions on 7 neighbouring livestock
holdings in South East Cornwall following an outbreak of brucellosis
in a beef suckler herd.
Preliminary test results have shown that 5 animals in the single herd
have the notifiable disease, which causes abortions in cattle. The
35-cow herd, near Liskeard, has been under restriction since
unexplained abortions were reported in the herd earlier in March 2004.
Further serological results are expected from the Veterinary
Laboratories Agency, Weybridge, very shortly. The 5 reactors will be
culled and if the laboratory culture results are positive, the whole
herd will be slaughtered.
State Veterinary Service vets are currently undertaking forward
tracings of animals that have left the suckler unit, although
evidence so far suggests that the overwhelming majority of animals
have gone to slaughter.
Farmers are reminded of their statutory requirement to notify
abortions in cattle immediately to Defra.
The neighbouring herds have been placed under movement restrictions
while blood tests take place. Milk tests from neighbouring dairy
farms show no evidence that the disease is currently present.
Wildlife can spread disease by moving infected afterbirth to
neighbouring farms, but it is normally spread by cattle-to-cattle
contact. While the disease is economically serious, it does not carry
the same implications as Foot and Mouth Disease. The Food Standards
Agency advise that whilst it is possible to catch the disease by
drinking infected unpasteurised milk or dairy products, this rarely
happens in the UK and the risk is very small. The risk from meat
products is even smaller.
Chief Veterinary Officer Jim Scudamore said that Great Britain has
official brucella-free status. There were 2 cases during 2003 in
Scotland which were linked with imported consignments from the
Republic of Ireland.
Mr Scudamore said it was vital for all livestock farmers,
particularly in Cornwall, to report all abortions in cattle to their
local Animal Health Divisional Office. Further investigations into
the source of the outbreak are continuing.
Notes for editors
1. Brucellosis of cattle is caused by infection with the bacterium
_Brucella abortus_, which can also cause a disease of humans known as
undulant fever. This used to be a major problem for farmers and vets.
A full question-and-answer brief is available from the Health
Protection Agency
(<http://www.hpa.org.uk/infections/topics_az/zoonoses/brucellosis/menu.htm>).
In cattle, it causes abortion or premature calving of recently
infected animals; the foetus, placenta and uterine fluid contain
large quantities of _Brucella abortus_ bacteria, which can affect
other cattle coming into contact with an infected animal around the
time of calving. The organism continues to be excreted in the milk;
in the past humans were frequently infected through drinking
unpasteurised milk.
2. Great Britain gained formal recognition as a region of the
European Union with Official Brucellosis-Free Status in 1991. OBF
status is not necessarily compromised by occasional outbreaks [see
comment].
3. Animals will be slaughtered under the Animal Health Act 1981. On
the farm, there are 35 cows and 96 other cattle (including bulls and
young stock). All susceptible animals on the farm will be slaughtered
following veterinary assessment.

[_Brucella abortus_ had not been isolated from any premises in Great
Britain since October 1993 until its confirmation on 4 premises in
Scotland during early 2003. An additional, unrelated case was
identified later (2 Dec 2003) in a Scottish beef herd when
post-import blood testing was undertaken on a heifer imported from
the Republic of Ireland.
<http://www.scotland.gov.uk/pages/news/2003/12/SEEN721a.aspx>
According to article 2.3.1.2. of OIE's terrestrial animal health
code, a Country or zone shall satisfy the following requirements to
qualify free from bovine brucellosis:
1) bovine brucellosis or any suspicion thereof is notifiable;
2) the entire cattle population is under official veterinary control
and it has been ascertained that the rate of brucellosis infection
does not exceed 0.2 percent of the cattle herds in the country or
zone under consideration;
3) the serological tests for bovine brucellosis are periodically
conducted in each herd, with or without the ring test;
4) no animal has been vaccinated against bovine brucellosis for at
least the past 3 years;
5) all reactors are slaughtered;
6) animals introduced into a free country or zone shall only come
from herds officially free from bovine brucellosis or from herds free
from bovine brucellosis. This condition may be waived for animals
which have not been vaccinated and which, prior to entry into the
herd, were isolated and were subjected to the serological tests for
bovine brucellosis with negative results on 2 occasions, with an
interval of 30 days between each test. These tests are not considered
valid in female animals which have calved during the past 14 days.
In a country where all herds of cattle have qualified as officially
free from bovine brucellosis and where no reactor has been found for
the past 5 years, the system for further control may be decided by
the country concerned. - Mod.AS]
