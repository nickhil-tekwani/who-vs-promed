An anthrax scare has hit Thirukanur and other villages in Tamil Nadu after several milch cows died in Villupuram district, reportedly due to anthrax. "Over 50 milch cattle had died in the last one week at Nolambour village in Vanur taluk of Villupuram district in Tamil Nadu. Hence we want the government to take measures to protect our animals," said A V Veeraghavan, a resident of Mannadipet and spokesperson of Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) in a petition to Chief Minister, Chief Secretary and secretary, Animal Husbandry.

Animals are traded in the Madgadipet market on the Puducherry-Villupuram highway by traders from Tamil Nadu, particularly from Kooteripet in Villupuram and such animals are bought by Puducherry cattle rearers. Some of the animals bought could be already [latently] infected by anthrax, fears Veeraghavan.

Moreover, death of a cow is not limited to the death of an animal, but has a socio-economic aspect as it would lead to loss of livelihood for those who make their earnings through sale of milk, he said. With the Department of Animal Husbandry not having adequate funds, there is a shortage in supply of medicines, vaccines, and injections [and presumably veterinary staff. - Mod.MHJ]. This should be addressed, he added.

[Unfortunately livestock anthrax is enzootic in Tamil Nadu, not unusually from the contaminated wastewater downstream from slaughterhouses and hide processing plants. With 50 cases, albeit unconfirmed, in one village, I might be more suspicious of exposure to contaminated dairy feed. With the high incidence of livestock anthrax in India, local commercial bone meals will not always be sterile.

In the past 5 years, Tamil Nadu reported 8 mixed cattle and small ruminant outbreaks in 2006, 2007 (12), 2009 (11), 2010 (4), 2011 (10), and 2012 (12). For good or ill they rarely report human cases these years, but this might just be a bureaucratic oversight.

It would be appreciated if one of our members in Tamil Nadu can provide confirmation of this bovine die-off from anthrax.
