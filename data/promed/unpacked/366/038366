Abstract: "The Ebola virus disease outbreak in West Africa was unprecedented in both its scale and impact. Out of this human calamity has come renewed attention to global health security -- its definition, meaning, and the practical implications for programmes and policy. For example, how does a government begin to strengthen its core public health capacities, as demanded by the International Health Regulations? What counts as a global health security concern? In the context of the governance of global health, including WHO reform, it will be important to distil lessons learned from the Ebola outbreak. The Lancet invited a group of respected global health practitioners to reflect on these lessons, to explore the idea of global health security, and to offer suggestions for next steps. Their contributions describe some of the major threats to individual and collective human health, as well as the values and recommendations that should be considered to counteract such threats in the future. Many different perspectives are proposed. Their common goal is a more sustainable and resilient society for human health and wellbeing."

[Prof. David L. Heymann, Head and Senior Fellow of the Chatham House Centre on Global Health Security, brought together a diverse group of experts to reflect on the broad meaning of global health security in the context of the West African Ebola outbreak, in a public policy paper published in _The Lancet_.

This is a very thorough examination of the lessons gleaned from the Ebola epidemic that is now winding down, with Liberia having just been declared Ebola-free on Sat 9 May 2015. Such discussions are critical to changing the system that allowed such a large outbreak to occur, to insure it does not happen again. - Mod.LK]

[2] Liberia declared Ebola-free
Date: 9 May 2015

WHO declares Liberia free of Ebola virus transmission. 42 days have passed since the last laboratory-confirmed case was buried on 28 Mar 2015. The outbreak of Ebola virus disease in Liberia is over.

Interruption of transmission is a monumental achievement for a country that reported the highest number of deaths in the largest, longest, and most complex outbreak since Ebola first emerged in 1976. At the peak of transmission, which occurred during August and September 2014, the country was reporting from 300 to 400 new cases every week.

During those 2 months, the capital city Monrovia was the setting for some of the most tragic scenes from West Africa's outbreak: gates locked at overflowing treatment centres, patients dying on the hospital grounds, and bodies that were sometimes not collected for days.

Flights were cancelled. Fuel and food ran low. Schools, businesses, borders, markets, and most health facilities were closed. Fear and uncertainty about the future, for families, communities, and the country and its economy, dominated the national mood.

Though the capital city was hardest hit, every one of Liberia's 15 counties eventually reported cases. At 1 point, virtually no treatment beds for Ebola patients were available anywhere in the country. With infectious cases and corpses remaining in homes and communities, almost guaranteeing further infections, some expressed concern that the virus might become endemic in Liberia, adding another -- and especially severe -- permanent threat to health.

It is a tribute to the government and people of Liberia that determination to defeat Ebola never wavered, courage never faltered. Doctors and nurses continued to treat patients, even when supplies of personal protective equipment and training in its safe use were inadequate. Altogether, 375 health workers were infected and 189 lost their lives.

Local volunteers, who worked in treatment centres, on burial teams, or as ambulance drivers, were driven by a sense of community responsibility and patriotic duty to end Ebola and bring hope back to the country's people. As the number of cases grew exponentially, international assistance began to pour in. All these efforts helped push the number of cases down to 0.

Liberia's last case was a woman in the greater Monrovia area who developed symptoms on 20 Mar 2015 and died on 27 Mar 2015. The source of her infection remains under investigation [See ProMED mail Ebola update (65): Liberia, possible sexual transmission, susp., funding 20150503.3338104, for discussion of ability of Ebola virus to be transmitted in semen]. The 332 people who may have been exposed to the patient were identified and closely monitored. No one developed symptoms; all have been released from surveillance.

Health officials have maintained a high level of vigilance for new cases. During April [2015], the country's 5 dedicated Ebola laboratories tested around 300 samples every week. All test results were negative.

While WHO is confident that Liberia has interrupted transmission, outbreaks persist in neighbouring Guinea and Sierra Leone, creating a high risk that infected people may cross into Liberia over the region's exceptionally porous borders.

The government is fully aware of the need to remain on high alert and has the experience, capacity, and support from international partners to do so. WHO will maintain an enhanced staff presence in Liberia until the end of 2015, as the response transitions from outbreak control, to vigilance for imported cases, to the recovery of essential health services.

Evolution of the outbreak
----
The start of the outbreak was deceptively slow. Health officials were on high alert for cases following WHO's confirmation, on 23 Mar 2014, of the Ebola outbreak in Guinea. Liberia's first 2 cases, in the northern county of Lofa near the border with Guinea, were confirmed on 30 Mar 2014.

On 7 Apr [2014], 5 more cases were confirmed, 4 in Lofa and 1 in Monrovia. All 5 died. The situation then stabilized, with no new cases reported during April and most of May [2014].

Further cases were detected in early June [2014], mainly in Lofa county, but the trend did not look alarming, especially when compared with the situation elsewhere. At the end of June [2014], Liberia reported 41 cases, compared with 390 in Guinea and 158 in Sierra Leone.

The impression of a calm situation turned out to be an illusion. The 1st additional cases in Monrovia were reported in mid-June [2014]. The city was ill prepared to cope with the onslaught of infections that rapidly followed as the virus raced through hospitals, communities, and eventually entire neighbourhoods.

Case numbers that had multiplied quickly began to grow exponentially. On 6 Aug 2014, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf declared a 3-month state of emergency and announced several strict measures aimed at getting cases down.

In mid-August [2014], a WHO team of emergency experts estimated that Monrovia needed 1000 beds just to treat currently infected patients. Only 240 beds were available.

In September [2014], WHO began construction of a new treatment centre, using teams of 100 construction workers labouring in round-the-clock shifts. On 21 Sep [2014], the Island Clinic was formally handed over by WHO to Liberia's Ministry of Health and Social Welfare. The clinic added 150 beds to Monrovia's limited treatment capacity. However, within 24 hours after opening, the clinic was overflowing with patients, demonstrating the desperate need for more treatment beds.

WHO supported the construction of 2 additional Ebola treatment centres, augmenting Monrovia's treatment capacity by another 400 beds. The remaining need was eventually met by multiple partners. The rapid increase in treatment capacity, especially in Monrovia, likely did much to turn the outbreak around.

The outbreak began to subside in late October [2014], when more new cases were detected early and rapidly treated in isolation, and more safe and dignified burials were performed. Case-fatality rates dropped. As the number of survivors grew, public perceptions changed from viewing treatments centres as "death traps" to seeing them as places of hope. That altered perception, in turn, encouraged more patients to seek early treatment.

The incidence of new cases stabilized in mid-November [2104], with daily reports showing only 10 to 20 new cases. During the early months of 2015, cases dwindled further, eventually allowing detection and investigation of the last remaining chains of transmission. From late March 2015 on, daily reports consistently showed 0 cases.

Factors that contributed to success: big dreams
-----
A number of factors contributed to the success of Liberia's Ebola response.

The 1st decisive factor was the leadership shown by President Sirleaf, who regarded the disease as a threat to the nation's "economic and social fabric" and made the response a priority for multiple branches of government. Her swift and sometimes tough decisions, frequent public communications, and presence at outbreak sites were expressions of this leadership.

As President Sirleaf famously stated in her memoir, "The size of your dreams must always exceed your current capacity to achieve them. If your dreams do not scare you, they are not big enough."

Next, health officials and their partners were quick to recognize the importance of community engagement. Health teams understood that community leadership brings with it well-defined social structures, with clear lines of credible authority. Teams worked hard to win support from village chiefs, religious leaders, women's associations, and youth groups.

One of the 1st signs that the outbreak might be turned around appeared in September 2014, when cases in Lofa county, Ebola's initial epicentre, began to decline after a peak of more than 150 cases a week in mid-August [2014]. Epidemiologists would later link that decline to a package of interventions, with community engagement playing a critical role.

In Lofa, staff from the WHO country office moved from village to village, challenging chiefs and religious leaders to take charge of the response. Community task forces were formed to create house-to-house awareness, report suspected cases, call health teams for support, and conduct contact tracing.

See-through walls around the treatment centre replaced opaque ones, allowing families and friends to watch what was happening inside, thus dispelling many rumours. Calls for transportation to treatment facilities or for burial teams were answered quickly, building confidence that teams were there to help.

The effectiveness of this response, which was duplicated elsewhere, points to a 3rd factor: generous support from the international community, including financial, logistical, and human resources. This support added more treatment beds, increased laboratory capacity, and augmented the number of contact tracing and burial teams. The deployment of self-sufficient foreign medical teams from several countries had a dramatic impact on the outbreak's evolution.

Finally, strong coordination of the international and national response was essential for success. International support was slow to start, but abundant when it arrived. Innovations such as the Presidential Advisory Committee on Ebola and introduction of an incident management system helped ensure that resources and capacities were placed where needed.

Many of these lessons and experiences are reflected in WHO's new response plan, which aims to identify all remaining cases in West Africa by June 2015.

[This is a very welcome milestone for Liberia, West Africa, and the world, and which the country should be proud to have achieved. Nonetheless, as recognized in Liberia, vigilance for evidence of reintroduction must be maintained, since neighboring Sierra Leone and Guinea continue to report cases, making for a fragile situation. - Mod.LK]

[3] Liberia: Vaccine trial phase 2 complete
Date: 7 May 2015
Source: Front Page Africa [edited]
http://www.frontpageafricaonline.com/index.php/health-sci/5145-liberia-completes-phase-two-of-ebola-virus-trial-vaccines


Liberia has completed Phase 2 of the experimental Ebola vaccines. "As of 30 Apr 2015, we have completed the vaccination of 1500; there was significant concern worldwide that Liberia could not conduct a rigorous study," Liberia lead Researcher Stephen Kennedy said.

Kennedy said, the clinical trial is safe based on an evaluation of the findings from an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board review. He explained that the study was initially for 600 people but added that the limited participation of females was one of the reasons responsible for the increase to 1500.

The Liberian Lead Researcher averred that study is the largest Ebola trial vaccines globally, adding that the primary winner in the study is the volunteers and that the clinical trial is safe due to several reviews by an independent panel adding that they have given a clean bill, "meaning we have done well. They have announced that the study has been relatively safe, despite the vaccines is over those who participated will be followed for 1 year," Kennedy said. Based on the findings the study has advanced to phase 2, the study is sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which is a part of the National Institutes of Health.

"We are grateful to the Liberian people who volunteered for this important clinical trial and encouraged by the study results seen with the 2 investigations Ebola vaccine candidates," said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. "Now we must move forward to adapt and expand the study so that ultimately we can determine whether these experimental vaccines can protect against Ebola virus disease and therefore be used in future Ebola outbreaks."

Dr. Kennedy disclosed that phase 3 of the study may likely not be done in Liberia because there is no new Ebola case. "We can no longer do that here in Liberia because we do not have Ebola." Kennedy said that discussion is ongoing to have [the next] phase of the study be carried out in either Guinea or Sierra Leone.

Kennedy said a regional approach is needed to complete study, adding with such vaccines countries in the region will be better prepared for future outbreaks. The Liberia lead researcher said the clinical trial was not done based on Liberian standards, adding it was based on internationally recognized standards. "The study that was done in Liberia can be taken to any country; we did not carry out a study that was a Liberian study, it was done based on international standards," Kennedy said.

The PREVAIL trial, which began on 2 Feb 2015 in Monrovia, Liberia, is testing the safety and efficacy of the cAd3-EBOZ candidate vaccine co-developed by NIAID scientists and GlaxoSmithKline, and the VSV-ZEBOV candidate vaccine developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada and licensed to NewLink Genetics Corporation and Merck.

Volunteers are assigned at random to receive a single injection of the NIAID/GSK (cAd3-EBOZ) vaccine, the VSV-ZEBOV vaccine, or a placebo (saline) injection. The trial is also double-blinded, meaning that neither study subjects nor staff knows whether a vaccine or placebo was administered. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is considered the "gold standard" in clinical research.

While the initial enrollment goal in the Phase 2 study has been met and the vaccines proven safe, the researchers are continuing Phase 2 study enrollment at Redemption Hospital in Monrovia, Liberia, through late April 2015. This would boost enrollment in the Phase 2 portion of the trial to approximately 1500 people and would be done, in part, to increase the percentage of women (currently, about 16 percent) in the study for a more robust data set overall.

The study follow-up period would be at least 1 year, and 2 additional blood samples would be obtained from all volunteers at 6 and 12 months post-vaccination to determine the durability of the immune responses. These proposed changes will be discussed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and are under review by the institutional review boards in Liberia and the United States.

Investigators planned to enroll 27 000 people in Liberia at risk of Ebola infection in the Phase 3 portion of the trial. Given this decline in Ebola infection incidence, the trial leaders -- H. Clifford Lane, M.D., NIAID Deputy Director for Clinical Research, and Liberian co-principal investigators Stephen Kennedy, M.D., and Fatorma Bolay, Ph.D. -- have determined that it is scientifically appropriate to expand the trial to additional sites in other West African countries. Discussions are underway to explore that possibility.

[The vaccine candidate, cAd3-EBOZ, uses a chimpanzee-derived cold virus to deliver Ebola virus genetic material from the Zaire strain of virus, which is the strain causing the outbreak in Liberia. The vaccine was co-developed by NIAID scientists and GlaxoSmithKline. The 2nd candidate in the trial, VSV-ZEBOV, employs vesicular stomatitis virus, an animal virus that primarily affects cattle, which carries an Ebola virus gene segment. The VSV-ZEBOV vaccine was developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada and licensed to NewLink Genetics Corporation through its wholly owned subsidiary BioProtection Systems Corporation.

According to NIH (http://www.niaid.nih.gov/news/newsreleases/2015/Pages/PREVAIL.aspx), participants were to be assigned at random to 1 or 3 equal-sized groups. Volunteers in 1 group received a placebo (saline) injection, while the others received a single injection of either the cAd3-EBOZ vaccine or the VSV-ZEBOV vaccine. In addition to including a placebo group, the trial was planned to be double-blinded, meaning that neither volunteers nor staff knew whether a vaccine or placebo was administered. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is considered the "gold standard" in clinical research. All participants were to be advised on how to minimize the risk of becoming infected with Ebola virus and should have been contacted by study staff about 1 week after the injection and then monthly for the duration of the study. -Mod.LK]
