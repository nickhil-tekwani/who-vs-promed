A total of 4 cases of brucellosis have been reported in the municipality of Villa Juárez in the State of San Luis Potosí, Mexico, according to a Pulso report (computer translated). The cases are being linked to unpasteurized goat cheese. It is recommended that the population acquire cheese that is pasteurized to avoid this contagion.

Brucellosis is a contagious disease of animals that also affects humans. In humans, it is known as undulant fever. Brucellosis is one of the most serious diseases of livestock, considering the damage done by the infection in animals. Decreased milk production, weight loss, loss of young, infertility, and lameness are some of the affects on animals. The Brucella species are named for their primary hosts: _Brucella melitensis_ is found mostly is goats, sheep and camels, _B. abortus_ is a pathogen of cattle, _B. suis_ is found primarily in swine and _B. canis_ is found in dogs.

There are 2 common ways people get infected with brucellosis. First, individuals who work with infected animals that have not been vaccinated against brucellosis. This would include farmers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians. They get infected through direct contact or aerosols produced by the infected animal tissue. _B. abortus_ and _B. suis_ are most common. The 2nd way is through ingesting unpasteurized dairy products. Brucellosis is also an occupational hazard to laboratory workers who inappropriately handle specimens or have an accident or spill. _Brucella_ is highly infectious in the aerosolized form.

If someone gets infected with _Brucella_, the incubation period is about 2-3 weeks, though it could be months. Fever, night sweats, severe headache and body aches and other non-specific symptoms may occur. Acute and chronic brucellosis can lead to complications in multiple organ systems. The skeletal, central nervous system, respiratory tract, the liver, heart, gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts can all be affected. Untreated brucellosis has a fatality rate of 5%.

[Brucellosis is a disease that is thought exists since ancient times, as it was 1st described more than 2000 years ago by the Romans and Hippocrates. It was not until 1887 that a British physician, Dr. David Bruce, isolated the organism that causes brucellosis from several deceased patients from the island of Malta. This disease has had several names throughout its history, including Mediterranean fever, Malta fever, Crimean fever, Bang's disease, and undulant fever (because of the relapsing nature of the fever associated with the disease). See: http://www.medicinenet.com/brucellosis/article.htm.

The symptoms and signs of brucellosis may develop from days to months after the initial exposure to the organism. While some individuals may develop mild symptoms, others may go on to develop long-term chronic symptoms.

The signs and symptoms of brucellosis are extensive, and they can be similar to many other febrile illnesses, so recognition of potential exposure from ingestion of unpasteurized milk or cheese, working in a slaughter house or meat processing plant, or working in a microbiology lab is critical information when evaluating a case. - Mod.LL
