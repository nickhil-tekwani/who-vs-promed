China; 74 Cases of Rabies Reported in Guangdong Province
--------------------------------------------------
At least 74 people have contracted rabies and [with fatal outcome] in
southern China, state press and local officials reported on Mon 21 Jul
2003. The Xinhua News Agency stated that the cases were reported in
Guangdong Province between 5 Jan and 30 Jun 2003, adding that almost 7000
dogs have been rounded up and killed. Governments at various levels in the
province have stepped up precautionary measures, including the organized
killing of stray dogs and the immunization of local residents, the report
said. An official at the Guangdong Health Department refused to give a
death toll. In Maoming, the most seriously affected area, almost 4000
people have been mobilized to round up and kill stray dogs. A total of 786
rabies cases have been reported in Guangdong since 1990, the Xinhua Agency
reported.
Rabies is a serious, fatal disease that can be transmitted by dogs, cats,
livestock, and certain wild animals and birds. Guangdong, where the SARS
virus originated, has also witnessed a "mini-outbreak" of encephalitis B
[caused by Japanese encephalitis virus] since the end of April 2003. The
most recent figures available, from 2 Jul 2003, showed that the disease had
killed 27 people from 310 confirmed infections.

[It might be more constructive and effective to implement compulsory canine
vaccination and to control wild-life rabies using baited vaccine, rather
than resorting to destruction of stray dogs and vaccination of the human
population in high-risk areas, as this report suggests is the current
policy. - Mod.CP]
