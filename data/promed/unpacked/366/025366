[Several factors can contribute to the spread of all avian influenza (AI) viruses, including: movements of people and goods, marketing practices (live bird markets), farming practices, and the presence of the viruses in migratory wild birds.

Wild birds can normally carry avian influenza viruses in their respiratory or intestinal tracts but they do not commonly get sick. They have historically been known as reservoirs and vectors of AI viruses. Around the world, surveillance measures have been put in place to monitor occurrence and characteristics of AI viruses in wild birds. The majority of AI viruses do not cause disease in wild birds, but is very likely that wild birds might spread the virus via their migratory flyways.

National authorities are strongly encouraged to raise the awareness and established cooperation mechanism with hunters and other individuals who may come into contact with wild birds, in order to provide early information on sick or dead wild birds (http://tinyurl.com/q7wwqma).

Subscribers are again encouraged to refer to the FAO EMPRES Watch Vol 35 (September 2016, p 1-6) entitled "H5N8 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) of clade 2.3.4.4 detected through surveillance of wild migratory birds in the Tyva Republic, the Russian Federation -- potential for international spread" available at http://www.fao.org/3/a-i6113e.pdf, mentioned previously in postings 20160920.4501532 and 20161104.4608240. - Mod.CRD
