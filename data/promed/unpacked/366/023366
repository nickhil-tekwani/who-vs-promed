A kitten and 2 raccoons have tested positive for rabies in Cobb and Douglas counties, and some people and pets were exposed to the animals. The Cobb and Douglas Public Health Department said Thursday [30 Jan 2020] that tests confirm all 3 animals -- one kitten and raccoon in Cobb and another raccoon in Douglas -- were all carrying the virus. The kitten was found by a couple in the 300 block of Baskin Drive in Marietta on 15 Jan [2020], according to Cobb County spokesman Ross Cavitt.

The kitten scratched the husband and wife, who took the animal to a veterinary clinic, where it also bit 2 technicians, Cavitt said. On 21 Jan [2020], a raccoon attacked a family dog in the 3700 block of Tommy Drive in Powder Springs. Cavitt said the dog was current on its rabies vaccination, but there was possible exposure to the family "because the husband killed the raccoon, and there was saliva and blood from the raccoon on the dog."

In Douglas County, spokesman Rick Martin said a raccoon tested positive after attacking a dog 16 Jan [2020] in the area of Bomar and Pope roads. The dog that was attacked, as well as another dog who may have been exposed, are under a 45-day quarantine. Valerie Crow, spokeswoman with the Cobb & Douglas Public Health Department, said humans exposed to the virus have received treatment.

Treatment typically includes the human rabies immune globin shot and rabies vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Animals and humans can get the virus if they are bitten or scratched by an infected animal. The virus, which affects the central nervous system, is "nearly 100% fatal without proper care following exposure," the department said. "Because survival is so rare following clinical signs of the virus, individuals exposed to or suspecting exposure from an animal bite should receive immediate medical attention to assess the need for vaccination and report the exposure to local animal control."

Health department officials encourage residents to take the following steps to reduce their chances of coming in contact with a rabid animal:
- Vaccinate all dogs, cats, and ferrets against rabies. You should also consider vaccinating livestock and horses, and other animals that have frequent contact with humans.
- Pet owners should not allow animals to roam free to reduce their chances of catching rabies; spaying or neutering your pet also cuts down on chances of animals roaming.
- Do not feed pets outdoors since empty bowls and stray food could attract wild animals.
- Keep garages securely covered.
- Avoid keeping wild animals like bats, raccoons, or foxes as pets.
- Teach children to never handle unfamiliar animals.
- Report wild animals acting aggressively and any animal bites to animal control officers. Cobb residents call 770-499-4136 and Douglas residents can dial 770-942-5961.

[Rabies virus remains a deadly disease that is preventable by vaccination. Take your pets for vaccination. It helps protect you too. There are very few people who have ever survived this disease, and their lives post-rabies is difficult, to say the least. Please protect yourself. Please protect your pets by getting vaccinations.

Pets without vaccinations who may get bitten or get in a fight with a wild animal may well be euthanized out of precaution to keep people safe. It is a painful way to lose a companion. Even young puppies and kittens can be infected with rabies.

The rabies virus infects the central nervous system. If a person does not receive the appropriate medical care after a potential rabies exposure, the virus can cause disease in the brain, ultimately resulting in death. Rabies can be prevented by vaccinating pets, staying away from wildlife, and seeking medical care after potential exposures before symptoms start.

After a bite or other rabies exposure, the rabies virus has to travel through the body to the brain before it can cause symptoms. This time between the exposure and the appearance of symptoms is called the incubation period, and it may last for weeks to months. The incubation period may vary based on the location of the exposure site (how far away it is from the brain), the type of rabies virus, and any existing immunity.

The 1st symptoms of rabies in human beings may be very similar to those of the flu, including general weakness or discomfort, fever, or headache. These symptoms may last for days.

There may also be discomfort or a prickling or itching sensation at the site of the bite, progressing within days to acute symptoms of cerebral dysfunction, anxiety, confusion, and agitation. As the disease progresses, the person may experience delirium, abnormal behavior, hallucinations, hydrophobia (fear of water), and insomnia. The acute period of disease typically ends after 2-10 days. Once clinical signs of rabies appear, the disease is nearly always fatal, and treatment is typically supportive. To date, less than 20 cases of human survival from clinical rabies have been documented, and only a few survivors had no history of pre- or postexposure prophylaxis.

If you have been bitten or scratched by an animal, wash the bite/scratch with copious amounts of soap and water. Seek medical attention.

Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) consists of a dose of human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) and rabies vaccine given on the day of the rabies exposure, and then a dose of vaccine given again on days 3, 7, and 14. For people who have never been vaccinated against rabies previously, PEP should always include administration of both HRIG and rabies vaccine. The combination of HRIG and vaccine is recommended for both bite and non-bite exposures, regardless of the interval between exposure and initiation of treatment.

People who have been previously vaccinated or are receiving preexposure vaccination for rabies should receive only vaccine.

Adverse reactions to rabies vaccine and immune globulin are not common. Newer vaccines in use today cause fewer adverse reactions than previously available vaccines. Mild, local reactions to the rabies vaccine, such as pain, redness, swelling, or itching at the injection site, have been reported. Rarely, symptoms such as headache, nausea, abdominal pain, muscle aches, and dizziness have been reported. Local pain and low-grade fever may follow injection of rabies immune globulin.

The vaccine should be given at recommended intervals for best results. Talk to your doctor or state or local public health officials if you will not be able to have your shots at the recommended interval. Rabies prevention is a serious matter, and changes should not be made in the schedule of doses. Patient-assistance programs that provide medications to uninsured or underinsured patients are available for rabies vaccine and immune globulin.

People cannot transmit rabies to other people unless they themselves are sick with rabies. PEP will protect you from developing rabies, and therefore you cannot expose other people to rabies. You can continue to participate in your normal activities.
