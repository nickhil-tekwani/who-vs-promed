The multistate hepatitis A outbreak linked to 'Townsend Farms Organic Antioxidant Blend', which contained pomegranate seeds from a company in Turkey, has increased to 162 cases as of [20 Sep 2013], according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) update Monday [23 Sep 2013]. The cases have been recorded from 10 states to include Arizona (23), California (79), Colorado (28), Hawaii (8), New Hampshire (1), New Jersey (1), New Mexico (11), Nevada (6), Utah (3), and Wisconsin (2).

The CDC notes that the cases reported from Wisconsin resulted from exposure to the product in California, and the cases reported from New Hampshire reported fruit exposure during travel to Nevada. All those affected reported eating this product purchased it from Costco markets.

The strain of hepatitis A, belonging to genotype 1B, was found in the majority of the patients. The CDC says this genotype is rarely seen in the Americas but circulates in North Africa and the Middle East. Based on Food and Drug Administration (FDA) traceback and traceforward investigations and the CDC's epidemiological investigation, FDA and CDC have determined that the most likely vehicle for the hepatitis A virus appears to be a common shipment of pomegranate seeds from a company in Turkey, Goknur Foodstuffs Import Export Trading.

The berry mix was recalled earlier this summer and on [29 Jun 2013], the FDA announced that it will detain shipments of pomegranate seeds from Goknur Foodstuffs Import Export Trading of Turkey when they are offered for import into the United States. There have not been any importations of these products since that time. The Turkish company has since been put on 2 separate Import Alerts.

[Hepatitis A is a liver disease caused by hepatitis A virus. The virus is primarily spread when an uninfected (and unvaccinated) person ingests food or water that is contaminated with the faeces of an infected person (in the above cases some person or persons involved in the processing of the frozen fruit). The disease is closely associated with a lack of safe water, inadequate sanitation and poor personal hygiene. Unlike hepatitis B and C, hepatitis A infection does not cause chronic liver disease and is rarely fatal, but it can cause debilitating symptoms and fulminant hepatitis (acute liver failure), which is associated with high mortality.

The map shows the current case count of persons infected with hepatitis A virus by state. - Mod.CP]
