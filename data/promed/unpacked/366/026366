Further possible cases of _E. coli_ infection are being investigated in children attending a Cork creche [childcare center] where a case has already been confirmed. The HSE told parents of children attending First Steps in Midleton that the infection is now being treated as "an outbreak investigation" following reports of diarrheal illnesses in more babies.

The HSE received official confirmation of the 1st case on Wed 19 Feb 2013. It is understood that a baby tested positive. All 85 children and 15 staff who attend the Mill Rd. creche must now be tested.

Yesterday [21 Feb 2013], the HSE distributed kits to parents for collection of 2 stool samples. The samples will have to be microbiologically tested at the National VTEC (Verotoxigenic [or enterohemorrhagic] _E. coli_) reference laboratory in Dublin. In the meantime, the parents have been warned by the HSE that their child should not attend any childcare facility until both samples test clear of infection. Staff have also been asked to refrain from working with children.

A parent whose child attends the creche said environmental health officers were "happy with hygiene and food preparation at the premises." He said the strain of EHEC infection has not been identified.

First Steps, which caters for children from 3 months and which also runs an after-school service, was shut temporarily as a precaution against the spread of EHEC. It is likely to remain closed until late next week. The source of infection has not yet been identified. A spokesperson for Cork County Council said yesterday [21 Feb 2013] that if the source of infection was the public water system, they would have been notified by the HSE.

"The HSE did not notify us; therefore, there is no problem with the public water supply," said the spokesperson.

[The serotype of EHEC in this cluster is not stated.

Secondary spread of EHEC is quite common in day care centers. A Minnesota study (1) reported person-to-person EHEC transmission in all 9 daycare facilities examined with a median attack rate of 22 percent. The median age of the primary case was 26 months. Introduction of EHEC into the daycare center is often from an asymptomatic, household-acquired infant. After EHEC is introduced into this setting, screening policies should not be based solely upon reported symptoms, since it is clear that asymptomatic shedding occurs. Because of this, in the presence of EHEC, screening of all children in attendance at the daycare setting with at least one stool examination for EHEC is recommended (2).
