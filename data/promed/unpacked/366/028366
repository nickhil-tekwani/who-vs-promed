Islands Closed - The Conservation Minister has closed the Auckland and
Campbell Islands to visitors in response to potential risks to human
health, from the mystery illness that has caused mass fatalities of New
Zealand (Hooker) sea lions. See the Politics Wire. There is general concern
that a series of environmental malaise may be linked. Besides the sea
lions, dead marine life have been washing up on the parts of the eastern
coasts of the Wairarapa and Kaikoura. In the Wairarapa a number of people
and animals have suffered sore throats, headaches and irritations, these
have been linked to algae at sea being blown on shore. Shellfish gathering
has also been stopped on Great Barrier Island following the discovery of
mussels contaminated with a natural toxin.

1. Animals are dying and swimmers are falling ill around the coast of New
Zealand. On Great Barrier Island people have been told to stop harvesting
shellfish, on the Wairarapa Coast people are becoming ill and seals are
dying on the Auckland Islands. The Conservation Minister has closed the
Auckland and Campbell Islands die to the unknown nature of the mysterious
ailment which is killing New Zealand sea lion pups.
2. Algae blooms are appearing around the coast causing problems for
shellfish and other marine mammals in a number of areas. El Nino is being
blamed.

Is it possible that this massive die-off of sea lions is a consequence of
the near extinction the species experienced in the 19th century?
The tremendous loss of biodiversity at that time would have led to extreme
inbreeding with the now large population possessing little biodiversity. All
students of biology are taught that biodiversity is the key to longevity of
a species. What we are seeing now might be massive die-offs of genetically
similar individuals of a population following exposure to some sort of
regularly occurring agent, biological or otherwise. While this event, from
human perspective, appears tragic, it is the age old winnowing of a
population by natural selection.

[An interesting idea but first off I would not expect such a scenario to
start with a massive die off 100 years later. Any comments? Latterly, it has
become clear that the removal of large parts of the middle of the marine
food chain, such as by large-scale fishing in international waters, can have
devastating effects on marine ecology as a whole. To return to our sheep,
can someone in New Zealand give us a better overview of what is being seen
and recorded in New Zealand waters beyond that in the sea lions. mod MHJ}
