Chronic wasting disease (CWD) has been in the news again this week with the report that a deer in Houston County in far southeast Minnesota tested "presumptive positive" for the disease.

In a news release Wednesday (4 Dec 2018), the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources said confirmation was expected, which will mean the 1st confirmed case of CWD in Houston County since testing began in 2002.

Now, it appears CWD also is making inroads in North Dakota, where a deer in Unit 3A1 initially has tested positive for the disease. As in Houston County, [MN], the case would be the 1st for northwest North Dakota.

According to Jeb Williams, wildlife chief for the North Dakota Game and Fish Department (NDGFD) in Bismarck, the deer was a mule deer buck shot in the northwest portion of Unit 3A1. As with any initial results coming back positive, a sample from the deer has been sent to a 2nd lab for confirmation, Williams said. Results from that 2nd test aren't yet available, but the department has never had an initial positive come back negative in secondary testing, he said.

"We are operating under the assumption it is" positive, Williams said Friday [7 Dec 2018].

An acronym having become all too familiar in recent years, CWD is a fatal brain disease to deer, elk, and moose. The DNR has been battling pockets of the disease in southeast and central Minnesota for several years with special hunts, feeding bans, and similar restrictions. In North Dakota, CWD had been confined to deer hunting Unit 3F2 in the far southwest part of the state, where testing already has found 2 more initial positives this year, Williams said.

North Dakota's 1st CWD case was confirmed in 2009, when a mule deer shot by a hunter in 3F2 tested positive. Including this year's 2 initial positives, that makes 11 cases of CWD in 3F2 and 1 likely case in 3A1, Williams said.

While disappointing, the news of an initial positive in northwest North Dakota isn't a surprise, Williams said. The department has been watching that part of the state since last spring, when a deer just 7 mi [11.3 km] across the border in Saskatchewan tested positive; CWD also has been found in neighboring Montana.

During an advisory board meeting 27 Nov 2018 in Fordville, ND, before news of the initial positive in 3A1, Williams said the department already was considering steps, including a baiting ban, to reduce the risk of CWD in northwest North Dakota because of its proximity to the Saskatchewan case.

North Dakota for years has prohibited baiting in 3F2 and has implemented restrictions on importing whole carcasses of deer, elk, or moose from states and provinces where CWD exists; in addition, whole carcasses can't be taken outside 3F2.

The import restrictions include no spinal column or brain matter.

Battling CWD is difficult because the disease isn't caused by a bacteria or virus, which eventually runs its course. Instead, CWD is triggered by an abnormal cellular protein called a prion, and once on the landscape, it's there to stay, Williams says. The prion can be transmitted through feces, saliva, urine, and other bodily fluids when deer are drawn into close contact at baiting sites.

"Since we 1st had CWD on the landscape in 2009, there's been a lot learned and a lot more research, a lot more discussion on CWD the last 10 years in a lot of states," Williams said in an interview before deer season. "And the bottom line is any of the information having come out in the last 10 years hasn't been good. There's nothing good giving us a thought process that we need to lessen our restrictions and regulations on CWD."

[This article expands CWD in both North Dakota and Minnesota. Both cases expand the range of this disease. At the rate this disease seems to be expanding its territory, the entire continental USA will likely have it before another decade passes. If the previous statement is viewed as prediction, then I hope I am wrong. - Mod.TG
