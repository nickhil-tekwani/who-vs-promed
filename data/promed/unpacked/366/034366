This article is of particular interest relative to data developed for _Pythium insidiosum_ incidence in our lab for the last several months. We have seen a significant increase in the number of serologic positive samples from canines and equines in the South Eastern region of the USA. For the period from [1 Jun to 25 Oct 2015] equine cases demonstrating antibodies titers, which correlate with significant exposure or infection have been greater than 150 cases. For the years from 2009 through 2014 the average number of similar cases, for the same time period, were less than 50 per year. In canines the 2009-2014 average was less than 25, but for 2015 these months we have had 60+ cases.

A similar increase was observed in samples originating from animals in Texas after the flooding experienced during the spring of 2015.

The increase is thought to be related to the periods of extreme rainfall and subsequent flooding, but may be also impacted by greater awareness and more frequent testing by the veterinary community.

_Pythium insidiosum_ is an oomycete [fungus] pathogenic in mammals. The infection occurs mainly in tropical and subtropical areas, particularly in horses, dogs, and humans. Infection is acquired through small wounds via contact with water that contains motile zoospores or other propagules (zoospores or hyphae). The disease, though described as emerging has in fact already been described since 1884. Depending on the site of entry, infection can lead to different forms of pythiosis, that is, a cutaneous, vascular, ocular, gastrointestinal, and a systemic form, which is rarely seen. The infection is not contagious; no animal-animal or animal-human transmission has been reported so far. Therapy includes radical surgery, antifungal drugs, immunotherapy or a combination of these therapies. The prevention to contract the disease in endemic areas is difficult. Avoiding stagnant waters could be of help, although the presence of _P. insidiosum_ on grass and soil in enzootic areas renders this practice useless. [Abstract from Gaastra W, Lipman LJ, De Cock AW, et al: _Pythium insidiosum_: An overview. Vet Microbiol 2010; 146(1-2): 1-16, doi:10.1016/j.vetmic.2010.07.019].

The research on this fungus infection in the US is described on the Pan American Veterinary Laboratories website (http://pavlab.com/pavlab/pythiosis-insidiosum/): "Pythiosis results from the infection with the fungal-like organism _Pythium insidiosum_ and occurs in equines, canines, felines, bovines, humans, and other species. This disease is also known as phycomycosis, Florida horse leeches, swamp cancer, and other colloquial names. The disease is worldwide in distribution and is especially prevalent in tropical regions. Recently, numerous cases have been reported in the Midwest and Northeast United States and as far north as Wisconsin and Washington State.

_P. insidiosum_ is an oomycete of the Kingdom Stramenopila. Pythium develops hyphae like structures and, in culture, appears similar to the fungi. It is one of many organisms belonging to the Pythium family, which typically infect plants in very wet environments. Pythium propagates by producing motile oospores, which travel through standing water and infect new hosts. Oospores, which come in contact with susceptible animals, may invade via breaks in the skin and set up infection.

During the past 10 years, we have studied the Pythium life cycle, introduced several immunological diagnostic assays. Research and development of an immunologic treatment for pythiosis continues."

Robert has widened our awareness to cover a probable mycotic infection response to rainfall. But, to return to the original observation, has anyone seen an increase in intestinal parasite infections in relation to the flooding in South Carolina or elsewhere? - Mod.MHJ]
