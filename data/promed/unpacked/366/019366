So far, a total of 6 patients in Argentina have undergone testing after being struck by a mystery illness, as 3 patients are currently still hospitalised. Tests ruled out the presence of most common infections, like COVID-19, sparking concerns of a new disease outbreak. Health officials on Wednesday [31 Aug 2022] announced that 2 people in northwest Argentina died this week from a form of severe pneumonia of "unknown origin".

While this disease is puzzling doctors, they assured that the situation was "under control". According to Argentina's Ministry of Health, the 6 reported cases are 5 health workers and one patient who started showing symptoms between [18 and 22 Aug 2022]. Three of the patients are still in the hospital, while one is in a "satisfactory condition" and has been isolating at home, according to health officials.

According to a statement by the National ministry, all of them "started showing symptoms between [18 and 22 Aug 2022]." The provincial minister, Luis Medina Ruiz, said: "These patients have in common a severe respiratory condition with bilateral pneumonia, and present an imagery very similar to COVID-19, but this has been ruled out." He added that the cases "have already been tested for COVID-19, influenza, influenza A and B, hantavirus (rodent-borne infections), and 25 other germs," all of which were negative.

He noted that while this disease may be due to an infectious agent like a virus or bacteria, toxic and environmental causes have not been ruled out. Authorities are now analysing the water and air conditions and sending samples for further analyses to the national reference laboratory in Buenos Aires.

Mr Ruiz added: "No new cases have been reported since [22 Aug 2022]." This included the close contacts of the patients, which the minster hailed as "positive news", assuring that the situation is "under control".

[ProMED would like to thank the many individuals that submitted information on these cases. - Mod.JH

The reports above describe an outbreak that likely involves a patient admitted to an ICU in Argentina and 5 healthcare workers, all with severe bilateral pneumonia that was fatal in 2 of the 6 (case fatality rate of 33%) patients. Sufficient detail is missing from the reports to know if the patient was the index case and the 5 healthcare workers developed pneumonia following contact with this initial patient. We are also not told the clinical characteristics of the disease other than bilateral pneumonia or if the initial patient was admitted with pneumonia or developed this infection once in the hospital. We are not told of any travel, occupational or other exposures that could have placed the initial index patient at risk.

The current situation in San Miguel de Tucumán is reminiscent of the emergence of new respiratory coronaviruses that include the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus in 2003 (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome virus (MERS-CoV), which had high secondary attack rates within healthcare facilities among healthcare workers due to unprotected exposure to infected patients and associated with high case fatality rates. According to the 2nd report above, COVID-19, influenza A and B, hantavirus (rodent-borne infections), and 25 "other germs" have been ruled out.

More information would be appreciated on the San Miguel de Tucumán outbreak from knowledgeable sources.

San Miguel de Tucumán (pop., almost 550 000 residents in 2010) is the capital and largest city of Tucumán Province, located in northern Argentina 1311 km (815 mi) from Buenos Aires; it is the 5th-largest city of Argentina after Buenos Aires, Córdoba, Rosario and Mendoza and the most important of the northern region (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Miguel_de_Tucumán).
