[The previous bovine outbreak in Botosani was in Flondora, Manoleasa, not in Trusesti (see 19 Jun 2017 Anthrax - Romania (03): (BT) bovine, human, OIE 20170619.5116427; 14 Jun 2017 Anthrax - Romania (02): (BT) bovine, human confirmed 20170614.5105743; and 13 Jun 2017 Anthrax - Romania: (BT) bovine, human susp 20170613.5102411), and was finally resolved on 25 Oct 2017. The August [2018] porcine outbreak in Botosana was reported in 7 Aug 2018 Anthrax - Romania: (BT) porcine, OIE 20180807.5951531; in this posting, we suggested the outbreak might have come about from feeding viscera from a dead cow to the pig in Saveni, also not in Truesesti.

As is unfortunate with many OIE formal reports, the cause of this and other Romanian outbreaks remains obscure. There is probably a background of unreported, unexpected livestock deaths that go unreported and uninvestigated. The ecology of Romanian soil is prime for anthrax spore survival. Botosani is at the top of a wide band of these soils along the eastern boundary of the country and along the southern border with Bulgaria. As a result, the disease maintains its sporadic nature. - MOD.MHJ
