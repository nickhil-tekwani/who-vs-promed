Two people have died from _Listeria_ infections in Australia after probably eating contaminated smoked salmon, officials say. A 3rd person also contracted the illness -- known as listeriosis -- but survived. The 3 cases happened in different states.

Local media reports that the contamination is believed to originate in Tasmania, which produces most Australian salmon.

Health officials warned people most at risk to avoid certain foods.

The people who died were both aged above 70 [years] and had underlying health conditions, said Australia's chief medical officer Prof Brendan Murphy.

The Tasmanian government said the state's salmon producers had been cleared of food safety breaches following the _Listeria_ cases in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland.

Officials said pregnant women, the elderly, infants, and those with weakened immune systems were most at risk of severe symptoms. "This is a timely reminder for people to ensure that food is handled, prepared and stored safely, and that those most at-risk of listeriosis avoid certain foods," Prof Murphy said in a statement on Wednesday [24 Jul 2019].

What is listeriosis? It can be caught from food containing _Listeria_ bacteria, or close contact with farm animals. Cases usually involve unpasteurised milk or dairy products, such as Camembert and brie. Pre-packed foods, including sandwiches and pate, can also contain _Listeria_. Symptoms include high temperature, flu-like symptoms, vomiting and diarrhoea. Most people infected display no symptoms, but elderly and very young people are vulnerable.

Last year [2018], a _Listeria_ outbreak traced to rockmelons killed 7 people across Australia. Other nations have also seen recent outbreaks. One in South Africa killed 180 people and was said to be the worst in history.

[_Listeria monocytogenes_ is widely distributed in the environment where it can form biofilms, which enables it to attach to solid surfaces and become extremely difficult to remove. It is found in the intestinal tract of many animals, including cattle, sheep, and humans, and is found in soil and water, especially in regions in close proximity to cattle farms, indicating that these animals may contribute to its dispersal in the environment through their fecal matter. The organism can be also found in agricultural land fertilized with sewage, and in silage, raw vegetables, raw meat and poultry, raw milk, soft cheeses, and kitchen premises, as well as in birds, crustaceans, fish, shellfish, ticks, and insects.

Refrigerated smoked salmon is a recognized potential source for listeriosis, similar to other cold cut meats and non-heat treated cured smoked meats, being a ready-to-eat product that does not require further cooking before eating.

Even if initial contamination adds only a few _Listeria _ organisms to the food, the contamination can be significant for refrigerated foods, because _Listeria_ can subsequently multiply at refrigerator temperatures to sufficient numbers to cause disease.

Genotyping the clinical isolates from the 3 affected individuals, if they match, will establish whether we are dealing with a common-source outbreak, and genotyping isolates from smoked salmon eaten by the affected individuals would establish transmission pathways, if the genotypes from the smoked salmon and the clinical isolates match. - Mod.ML
