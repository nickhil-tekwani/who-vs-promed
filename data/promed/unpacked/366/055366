Re: ProMED-mail. Classical swine fever - South Korea: (CJ) OIE, RFI 20160708.4333148

Korea QIA maintains a variety of active sero surveillance on poultry, swine and cattle farms on weekly basis. Most likely based on these surveillance systems, Minister of Food and Drug Safety decides collective slaughtering of animals.

[ProMED-mail thanks Sangwoo Tak for the submission above, responding to the following published RFI: "According to the report, the event involved 2 animals with "Sub-clinical infection", leading to their - and the entire holding's - immediate destruction. Such a scenario may be indicative of an ongoing monitoring/surveillance scheme. Details thereof, or of a possible other policy explaining the detection of the infection, will be helpful".

The efficiency of Korea's "Targetted surveillance" on swine farms in relation to CSF has been demonstrated by its ability to discover the subterranean circulation of the virus in the current event. According to the report, CSF vaccination is "prohibited", thus the surveyed population is expected to be fully susceptible to the virus. It will be interesting to note if the virus involved, apparently of Chinese origin, is being further studied for its pathogenicity and genetic background. China has been applying since decades mass vaccinations of swine with live attenuated vaccine strains. - Mod.AS]
