PALENQUE, Mexico -- Vampire bats preying on the cattle of southernmost
Mexico have caused an outbreak of rabies killing thousands of cattle.
Ranchers and a veterinarian who coordinates several government animal
health programs have criticized state officials for failing to act quickly
to control the outbreak; state officials insists it's under control.
"The outbreak is very grave. They did not take precautionary measures and
there is a delay in the distribution of vaccines by health authorities,"
said Yolanda Herrera, a veterinarian with the Mexico-U.S. Commission for
the Prevention of Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD). She said bats should also
be targeted in the caves and corrals where they live.
Candido Lopez, spokesman for the Livestock Union of the Northern Region of
Chiapas, said the outbreak began early this year in the impoverished state
of Chiapas, where most ranches are small.
At least 2 300 cattle have died on 92 ranches in the first 3 months of the
year, according to Gilberto Perez Guillermo, a spokesman for the regional
department of livestock health. Jesus Ugalde, leader of the Livestock
Association in Palenque, 1 of 4 affected municipalities, put the number of
deaths at 3 000.
Perez Guillermo said the bats have attacked 27 residents of the northern
municipality of Salto de Agua, many of whom live in wooden shacks without
doors. The victims were being treated by health officials to prevent them
from getting rabies, he said.
But the health minister for Chiapas, Humberto Cordoba, said the bats had
not attacked any people.
Herrera, who conducted necropsies on some of the dead cattle, said 90
percent of the deaths were caused by rabies transmitted by vampire bats.
She said rabies first appeared in central Chiapas in 1987 and has spread
throughout the state as the bats migrated.
However, the chief of animal health for the state Ministry of Agriculture,
David Lopez, insisted the rabies outbreak was under control. He said his
agency had provided 60 000 rabies vaccines to local ranchers at a cost of
about 11 cents each -- far cheaper than the 90 cents charged by private
clinics.
Ugalde said it was only a tenth of the 600 000 vaccines needed. "It isn't
possible for the state to ignore this emergency situation and say it is
under control," he said. "On the contrary, it is ... a serious public
health problem."
Rancher Pedro Lopez, who lost 7 cattle to the disease on his small ranch,
criticized the government for its inaction. "We have no help from the
government. The vaccines are expensive for us at private laboratories,"
said Lopez, 70.
"It's shocking," said Manuel Perez, a cowboy at another ranch. "In less
than a month more than 50 registered animals have died, between bulls, cows
and calves. We have never faced a situation so grave."
Francisco Coller, head of the state agency charged with eradicating the
bats, said the effort was initially slowed by ranchers' failure to
recognize the threat and their reluctance to vaccinate their herds. "Now
the panic has grown because of the impressive death of cattle and now the
same producers who denied the existence of the bats are asking us to
eradicate them," he said.
