In Seattle & King County, Washington, beginning in late March 2012, influenza B isolates have outnumbered influenza A isolates in our sentinel lab surveillance and at the University of Washington clinical virology laboratory (primarily pediatric isolates). Since that time, flu B has continued to increase. This is coincident with an increase in the proportion of influenza-like-illness (ILI) emergency department (ED) visits among children 5-17 years, such that since late March 2012, the proportion has exceeded the 5-year peak seasonal average for this age group by a few percentage points. ED ILI visits for other age groups remain similar to or below peak 5-year average ILI levels. Five-year average levels exclude the 2009 H1N1 season.

Prior to the increase in influenza B, we were seeing a mixture of A/H1N1 and A/H3N2, and for approximately the past 10 weeks, those strains have been isolated in roughly equal numbers without any corresponding spike in ILI above seasonal peak levels among any age group.

A limited number of local influenza B isolates have been subtyped by CDC, with approximately equal numbers of Yamagata and Victoria lineage viruses. This suggests to me that the current increase in ILI among school age children may be related to late season influenza B activity with a significant proportion of non-vaccine-related flu B strains.
