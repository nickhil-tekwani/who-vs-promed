At least 63 people died of Japanese encephalitis in Assam in the last 37 days while 347 were infected, prompting the state health department to undertake various measures to deal with the disease, reports said on 8 Aug 2022.

On 6 Aug 2022, 3 fresh deaths were reported from Nagaon district while fresh infections were reported from 10 districts including Cachar, Dibrugarh and Kamrup Metro.

According to the National Health Mission (NHM), since 1 Jul 2022, at least 63 people have died after being infected by the vector-borne disease in more than 22 of the state's 35 districts.

NHM officials said that they directed the district authorities to constitute district rapid response teams and accordingly, these were constituted to keep a close watch on the situation and to take preventive measures.

Japanese encephalitis and malaria kill many people in Assam every year, specifically during the monsoon season that usually starts in May and stretches to October.

Principal secretary, health, Avinash Joshi and NHM director MS Lakshmi Priya are in close touch with the district authorities and asked them to remain pro-active to deal with the situation.

The NHM has also issued a standard operating procedure and guidelines to tackle the situation arising with the outbreak and health workers have been conducting a massive awareness campaign against the disease.

[Cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) in Assam continue to increase at several locations in this state. Since 1 Jul 2022, the number of deaths has increased to 63. The number of JE cases has risen rapidly from 183 reported on 19 Jul 2022 to 347 cases on 8 Aug 2022. Interestingly, these 347 cases were classified as JE and not acute encephalitis syndrome. Although there is still no mention of a vaccination campaign in the state the previous report indicated that fogging with malathion is being done. The current JE virus transmission season may last an additional 2 or more months, so more cases can be expected. - Mod.TY]
