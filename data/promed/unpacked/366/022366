These data are being published in the EWARS (early warning reporting
system) weekly bulletin No. 33 published by the epidemiology and disease
control division of the [Nepal department of health services, Ministry of
Health.
Yesterday, WHO/SEARO air-freighted JE diagnostic kits; samples will be
processed at the National Public Health Laboratory, Teku, Kathmandu. If
enough kits are available, the BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences
(Dharan) will be also processing samples for the Eastern Region.
As results become available, we'll be informing accordingly.

Epidemiological Alert!:
There has been an alarming increase in the reported number of cases/deaths
of encephalitis since the epidemiological week No. 32. The majority of
these cases are believed to be secondary to Japanese Encephalitis (JE). JE
is an acute inflammatory disease involving the central nervous system and
is caused by a virus. Primarily a zoonotic disease, it is transmissible to
humans through the bite of mosquitoes. In Nepal, it occurs in seasonal
outbreaks (May-October with a peak between August and September). Not all
individuals bitten by infected mosquitoes develop the disease (average
ratio of overt disease to inapparent infection 1:300). Mild cases often
occurs as febrile headache or aseptic meningitis; severe infections are
usually marked by acute onset, headache, high fever, meningeal signs,
stupor, disorientation, coma, tremors, occasional convulsions (especially
in infants) and spastic (rarely flaccid) paralysis. Respiratory
dysregulation, coma, abnormal plantar reflexes, prolonged convulsions and
extreme ages, are associated with poor prognosis. Case fatality rates may
reach 20-50% and sequelae may occur in up to 70% of the survivors.
Epidem. Week No.33: 300 cases and 52 deaths due to encephalitis had been
reported to the EDCD/DHS through the EWARS network, with 3 hospitals
reporting the majority of cases: Koshi Zonal Hospital (Biratnagar, Morang
district) has reported 85 cases (including 12 deaths); Bheri Zonal Hospital
(Nepalgunj, Bankey District) reported 45 cases (2 deaths) and Birgunj
Hospital (Bara district), with 83 cases (including 18 deaths). Jhapa,
Butwal and Bharatpur have also reported an important number of cases (37,
33 and 22 respectively, with 10, 4 and 2 deaths). During 1997 epidemic
"peak" (Weeks No. 15-41), 1500 cases and 86 deaths of encephalitis were
reported through the EWARS (only 8 hospitals reporting). As in 1998, a
dramatic increase in the number of cases was observed from week No. 28.
Cases were reported from 24 districts (32% of the total number of districts
in the country); 56% of the cases were male, with 50% of cases in the age
group of 5-14 years, 32 % aged 15-44 years and 12% in the age group of 1-4
years. A total of 229 serological samples were collected and tested for JE
antibodies; of these, 123 (54%) were positive to JE. Eleven cases (5%) were
positive to _P. falciparum_ and 3 (1.3%) to _P. vivax_.
Case definition: "any case having elevated temperature (> 38 C), altered
consciousness or unconsciousness, will be considered suspected
meningitis/encephalitis and referred for lumbar puncture"; "if the
suspected case has between 5-100 cells per mm3 (predominantly lymphocytes)
in the CSF, it will be diagnosed as having probable viral encephalitis";
"if a probable viral encephalitis case has a positive anti-IgM test in the
CSF or serum at the time of illness, the case will be considered as a
confirmed case of encephalitis due to Japanese Encephalitis Virus".
Diagnostic methods: 1) At HP/SHP levels, diagnosis will be based on the
clinical features presented by the patient; if classified as possible
meningitis/encephalitis, the case needs to be referred to a more
specialized treatment facility. 2) At PHC, District and Zonal Hospitals,
possible meningitis/encephalitis cases will be subjected to lumbar puncture
for complete CSF examination. In the absence of a skilled laboratory
technician, lumbar puncture must be carried out to look for pressure,
turbidity and cell count; in endemic areas of _P. falciparum_ or outbreaks
have been reported recently, a blood film to look for malaria parasites
must be done. 3) CSF and Serum specimens for the detection of specific IgM,
should be collected and referred to the NPHL, Teku, Kathmandu.
