A report yesterday [28 Sep 2022] from the UK's Health Security Agency (HSA) shows sexually transmitted _Shigella_ infections are rising again in England after falling during the COVID-19 pandemic (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/non-travel-associated-shigella-infections/sexually-transmitted-shigella-spp-in-england-data-up-to-quarter-2-2022#antimicrobial-resistance-among-sexually-transmitted-shigella-spp). Analysis of data from 2 surveillance databases, the Second-Generation Surveillance System (SGSS) and the Gastrointestinal Data Warehouse (GDW), shows _Shigella_ infections climbed by 189% in SGSS and 172% in GDW from the 3rd quarter of 2021 to the 2nd quarter of 2022.

The number of travel- and non-travel-related shigellosis cases began to climb following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions and is now nearing prepandemic levels. The increase was most notable (127%) in men who have sex with men (MSM), and the highest proportion of diagnoses among presumptive MSM was in London. The report also found that among presumptive MSM, antimicrobial resistance is consistently high in _Shigella flexneri_ and _Shigella sonnei_ isolates, with 96% and 92% of isolates classified as multidrug resistant (MDR) or extensively drug resistant (XDR), respectively. A sustained increase in the proportion of XDR _S. sonnei_ has been driven by a resurgence of an _S. sonnei_ clade 5 outbreak strain.

In a recent study [see citation below] published in the Lancet Infectious Diseases, HSA investigators reported that of 72 confirmed shigellosis cases identified in the UK from 1 Sep 2021 to 9 Feb 2022, all belonged to clade 5 and all were genotypically MDR or XDR.

While shigellosis is often associated with exposure to contaminated food and water, it can be transmitted through oral and anal sex and is considered a sexually transmitted disease. A report in February 2022 from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) noted an increase in XDR _S. sonnei_ infections in the UK and elsewhere in Europe and warned that the risk of spread among networks of MSM who engage in high-risk sexual practices, such as oral-anal contact, could be high in the coming months (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Shigella-infections-MSM-Feb-2022.pdf).

Shigella_ was discovered over 100 years ago by Japanese microbiologist Kiyoshi Shiga, for whom the genus is named. There are 4 species: _S. boydii_, _S. dysenteriae_, _S. flexneri_, and _S. sonnei_. _Shigella_ organisms can survive transit through the stomach since they are less susceptible to acid than other bacteria; for this reason, as few as 10 to 100 organisms can cause disease. Ingested bacteria pass into the small intestine, where they multiply; large numbers of bacteria then pass into the colon, where they enter the colonic cells. Given its relatively low infectious dose, transmission can occur via contaminated food and water or via direct person-to-person spread including sexual practices more common in MSM (men who have sex with men). Humans are the only natural reservoir for the disease.

Dysentery (formerly known as flux or the bloody flux) is an inflammatory disorder of the colon, which results in severe diarrhea containing mucus and/or blood in the feces with fever, abdominal pain, and rectal tenesmus (pain while passing the diarrhea).

The following are comments from by colleague Mod.ML from an earlier post:

Of the 4 _Shigella_ species (_Shigella sonnei_, _Shigella flexneri_, _Shigella boydii_, and _Shigella dysenteriae_), _S. sonnei_ is the commonest species in the United States. Humans are the only reservoir for _Shigella_, which are easily transmitted person to person because _Shigella_ are relatively resistant to gastric acidity, and only a few (10 to 100) organisms, if swallowed, will survive passage through the stomach and be sufficient to establish infection in the lower intestinal tract.

The organisms are spread via hands, mouth, food, or water that have come into contact with the stool of a person infected with _Shigella_. Humans are the only natural reservoir for the disease. Although shigellosis is usually self-limited in 5-7 days without antimicrobial treatment, antibacterials are commonly used to decrease fecal excretion of the organism, which may otherwise last up to several weeks and, for severe cases, have prolonged dysentery or sepsis. However, resistance to antimicrobials has restricted treatment options.

In 2015 ProMED posted a report of an outbreak of multidrug-resistant (MDR) _Shigella sonnei_ in the USA, affecting more than 300 people, which appeared to have been repeatedly imported by international travel in men who have sex with men (MSM) (ProMED post Shigellosis - USA (03): travel, MSM, antimicrobial resistance 20151021.3732921). In 2016 ProMED posted a report of a single clone, based on whole-genome sequencing (WGS), widespread in South Asia, that was likely driving an intercontinental surge of ciprofloxacin-resistant _S. sonnei_ (ProMED post Shigellosis, antimicrobial-resistant - South Asia: spread 20160904.4464085). Then, in 2019, ProMED reported an outbreak between March and November 2018 in the UK of 17 cases of shigellosis caused by an MDR _Shigella_ clone, based on whole-genome sequencing, that clustered among MSM. A total of 9 further cases were identified in the USA (Shigellosis - UK: multiresistant, MSM 20190128.6279377 and https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/769163/SHGLL-SONN_2018275.pdf).

Resistance markers in this clone included blaCTX-M-27, which encodes an extended-spectrum Î²-lactamase (ESBL), a single gyrA mutation associated with reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones and the macrolide resistance markers erm(B) and mph(A). Consequently, treatment of infections caused by this MDR strain with fluoroquinolones, azithromycin, and ceftriaxone is unlikely to be effective. TMP/SMX had been one of the drugs of choice for treatment of shigellosis, but emerging resistance to this antimicrobial drug limited its empiric use (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3462054/). - Mod.LL
