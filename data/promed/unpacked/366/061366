Surveillance for the World Cup, France, 1998
The association football World Cup 1998 began in France yesterday, and will
attract many thousands of visitors to its ten venues (for which 27 of the
97 local health departments in metropolitan France are responsible) until
after the final whistle blows on 12 July. The concentration of people at
mass gatherings provides an opportunity for the spread of communicable
diseases (1) as well as for injury and the effects of exposure to the
environment, causing - for example, heat related illness (likely to be a
particular problem during day time games in the south of France
(Montpellier, Toulouse, and Marseilles)). Just as for the Atlanta Olympics
(1,2), preparations for the World Cup have included considerable planning
to create systems for the surveillance, prevention, and control of disease.
The objectives of the surveillance system are to detect outbreaks that may
require investigation and intervention (e.g. foodborne outbreaks), unusual
diseases that may require prevention or control measures (e.g. diphtheria),
and clustering of disease events that may justify collective prevention
measures (such as heat related illness).
Data will be collected from three main sources. Notifiable disease
surveillance is being activated, with daily rather than weekly transmission
of notifications to the Reseau National de Sante Publique in Paris. All
health workers directly involved in the event (emergency rooms, health care
providers in the stadiums, paramedics (SAMU), and the fire department) are
collecting disease event data in a standard format. Apart from unusual
diseases, health events under routine surveillance include gastroenteritis
and foodborne outbreaks, heat related illness, acute respiratory
infections, meningitis, and asthma. More than a thousand sentinel general
practitioners, private pharmacists, laboratories, and a pharmaceutical drug
distributor voluntarily report daily to health authorities.
A computer application has been designed to analyse data daily and produce
an epidemiological report to the ministry of health and the public. In the
absence of precise denominators, indicators will include proportional
morbidity (e.g. the percentage of general practitioners' workload
attributable to gastroenteritis) and trends that make use of averaged data
for the preceding three days. Data are accessible (in French) on the
Internet site of the Reseau National de Sante Publique:

As well as enabling health authorities to monitor the situation, the
surveillance system is increasing the awareness of health care providers
for public health surveillance. The mobilisation of the resources described
towards the goal of controlling disease spread is the key to ensuring a
safe and healthy World Cup.
