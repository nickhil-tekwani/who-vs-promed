Japan reports another outbreak of avian flu
--------------------------------------------
3 chickens at a farm in western Japan have tested positive for avian
flu in what may be the country's 5th outbreak of the disease,
officials said Thursday.
The news was another blow to Japan's increasingly frantic efforts to
contain the deadly illness, which has already spread through much of
Asia. The government immediately banned people from going within a
500-metre radius of the poultry farm, located outside Kyoto, and sent
more than 100 troops to help decontaminate affected farms.
"We may be headed for the worst possible scenario," said Kyoto
prefectural Gov. Keiji Yamada. "We must strictly investigate the
route of infection."
Officials were conducting further tests to confirm that the 3 birds
had contracted the flu. They will also determine whether the birds
were infected with the deadly H5N1 strain that has killed 22 people
in Thailand and Vietnam.
The H5N1 strain has been reported in 8 Asian countries, and
governments throughout the region have slaughtered 100 million
chickens, ducks, and other poultry in efforts to keep the virus from
spreading.
Tests on the 3 chickens in Japan were conducted after a farmer became
concerned over the deaths of 11 chickens and notified authorities.
The birds were from a farm 5 kilometres north of Asada Nosan, in the
town of Tamba, where more than 130 000 birds perished last week in a
flu outbreak. Asada management has come under fire for not telling
authorities its chickens were dying en masse, preventing officials
from containing the disease at an early stage.
The Kyoto government was tipped off about that outbreak by an
anonymous phone call.
The 3 chickens in the latest case had no contact with birds from
Asada Nosan, and authorities were investigating how the flu might
have spread.
Kyoto is about 370 kilometres west of Tokyo.
On Thu, 4 Mar 2004, about 120 ground troops arrived in Tamba to
begin spraying cages at both farms, using the same chemicals that
cleaned Tokyo's subways after a religious cult released the nerve gas
serin on trains in 1995.
Japan's top government spokesman said Tokyo would consider revising
laws to compel farmers to quickly report suspected cases.
"Once a disease breaks out, it is important that farmers notify the
authorities," said Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuo Fukuda.
"We can minimize the damage if everybody adopts this attitude."
On Wednesday, the Agriculture Ministry announced new fines for
farmers who don't immediately report suspected outbreaks or conceal
cases. The government also earmarked subsidies for farms where the
flu has been confirmed to have killed chickens.
Japan's possible 4th outbreak was detected on a farm in Shimane
prefecture, about 720 kilometres west of Tokyo. A preliminary test
earlier this week indicated a chicken there had the disease.

[Discovering sporadic cases of HPAI in very small holdings underlines
the level of alertness in Japan. As seen during 2003's HPAI in the
Netherlands, small holdings and hobby birds may become a significant
obstacle on the road to
complete disease eradication.
For updated (5 Mar 2004) information on the H5N1 situation in China,
Indonesia and Thailand, as well as on the H7 situation in Pakistan,

Results of the laboratory investigations, in particular, data on the
influenza strain involved, are anticipated. - Mod.AS]
