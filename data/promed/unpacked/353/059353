Health officials have discovered three new cases of listeri[osis in
France, bringing to 26 the number of people who have been [infected by the
bacterium since outbreaks began in November.
In a statement released late Friday, the Health Ministry said the National
Listeria Center had found two elderly people and a newborn infant suffering
from listeriosis.
The statement also said the three newest cases were likely caused by the
consumption of tainted pork tongue in gelatin. Authorities have said that
pork tongue is likely at the root of the epidemic, though they have not yet
isolated the specific factory where the meat was produced.
Seven people have died of listeria poisoning in France since outbreaks
started in November.

[We have received additional news reports that I have not posted since they
did not shed much light on the source of the outbreak and did not report
new cases. To summarize reports from various French and Spanish
newspapers, the strain of _Listeria_ isolated from Sapar food products pork
tongue was reported to be different from the strain responsible for the
outbreak. The Sapar plant mysteriously burned two days after this strain
discrepancy was reported, so records have been destroyed. Sapar pork
tongue was initially suspected because of a report from Austrian customs
officials that Sapar pork tongue products had unacceptable levels of
_Listeria_ contamination. Most EU countries have recalled Sapar products at
this point in time. Pork tongue is still suspected since 55% of infected
persons have reported consuming this product. Eleven suppliers are under
investigation. - Mod.ES
