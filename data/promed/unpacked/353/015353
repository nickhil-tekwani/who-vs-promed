The 2006 FIFA World Cup football tournament began
in Germany on 9 Jun [2006] and will continue
until 9 Jul [2006] [1]. An estimated 3.2 million
fans from many countries, including Germany, will
attend at least one of the 64 matches [2], which
are being played in 12 cities around Germany.
An outbreak of measles in children and young
people has been occurring since the beginning of
January 2006 in the German state of
Nordrhein-Westfalen, and consequently, several
governmental agencies in countries throughout
Europe, and the WHO Pan American Health
Organization, are advising travellers to Germany,
especially football fans and people travelling to
this state, to ensure that they have had measles
vaccination before their trip. The mumps, measles
and rubella (MMR) vaccine is recommended. [3-6].

Three of the 12 cities where matches are being
played are located in Nordrhein-Westfalen
(Koeln/Cologne, Dortmund and Gelsenkirchen),
although sporadic measles cases only have been reported in these cities.
The latest cumulative total of notified measles
cases in the Nordrhein-Westfalen outbreak now
stands at 1452 (an incidence in the state of
8/100 000 inhabitants). Most cases have been
reported in children and young people. Although
this number is still increasing, the weekly
reported case numbers are falling, from a peak of
151 cases in April (week 17, 2006) to fewer than
50 per week currently. This outbreak has so far
resulted in 4 cases of measles encephalitis and
one case of measles meningitis [7].
There are also ongoing outbreaks of measles in a
number of other European countries, the largest
being in the Ukraine, where it is affecting
mainly young adults, and the case total exceeded
20 000 at the end of February 2006 [8]. The
Ukrainian national football team is one of the 32
World Cup qualifying teams and Ukrainian fans
have travelled to Germany to attend matches. The
Ukrainian team's first match took place on 14 Jun
[2006] in Leipzig, eastern Germany.
In addition to the enhanced surveillance and
response system implemented during the World Cup
[1] the local and state health authorities and
the Robert Koch-Institut (RKI) have the following
procedures in place, should people from other
countries be identified as being infected with or
exposed to the measles virus and plan to return
to their home country during the infectious
period (usually 4 days before and after onset of rash).
1. Suspected measles is a notifiable event in
Germany and such notification will trigger
investigations and control measures as indicated
by the local health authorities.
2. Affected and exposed persons will be given
advice on how to reduce the risk of transmitting the infection to others.
3. The national reference laboratory for measles
at the RKI offers free laboratory testing of
suspected measles cases and has distributed
non-invasive as well as traditional testing kits
to the local health departments where World Cup games are taking place.
4. People from foreign countries who are
suspected to be infected with or exposed to the
measles (or other notifiable infectious
pathogens) will also be asked to contact the
local health authority at home once they have
returned. A form will be filled out in English
which will contain the individual�s self-reported
travel itinerary, details on the diagnostic
evidence and additional epidemiological
information. With the individual's permission,
the RKI will immediately transmit this form to
the national public health institution in his/her country of residence.
5. Information concerning important infectious
disease events during the World Cup in Germany,
updated daily, is available in English and German at <http://www.rki.de >.
For visitors to Germany, the additional risk of
acquiring measles by attending the World Cup
games or related events in Germany is estimated
to be very small. Travellers to many other
countries with measles outbreaks may be at higher
risk of measles infection even if special travel
alerts are not published. Nevertheless, doctors
should be aware that anyone, including adults,
with rash and fever who has recently returned
from Nordrhein-Westfalen or other areas with
current measles outbreaks could have contracted measles.
Regardless of the current outbreaks in Europe and
the World Cup gathering, it is always advisable
for people living in or travelling to Europe
ensure that they are fully immunised against
measles. The World Health Organization Regional
Office for Europe aims to eliminate measles in the region by 2010.

[This has been a significant year for measles
activity in Europe (see references below, as well
as the body of text in the above report). The
recommendation for attendees to the World Cup to
be up-to-date on measles vaccinations is a
prudent one. One hopes that the recommendation,
while voluntary, will have a high compliance to
prevent further importations of measles virus
into countries that have interrupted transmission of measles virus.
