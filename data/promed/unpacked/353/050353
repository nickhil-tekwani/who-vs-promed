Speculation on the Role of Tonsillitis in Prion Transmission
------------------------------------------------------------
Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) [previously abbreviated as CJD new
var. is the human form of mad cow disease. The victims of vCJD may have
succumbed to the disease because they ate contaminated beef when they were
suffering from a bout of tonsillitis or a simple sore throat. This theory
has been advanced by a leading American scientist, Professor Stephen
DeArmond, of the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF). He said
it could explain why relatively few people had been struck down with the
illness so far and why so many of those who had were under the age of 35.
Scientists still know very little about why the vCJD seems to strike some
people and not others. To date, it has killed 94 people in the UK. Another 8
are suspected sufferers and are still alive. Researchers believe the illness
is caused [when infectious proteins called prions [are passed to humans
through meat contaminated with the brains and spinal tissue of cattle
suffering from bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease.
But the exact route remains a mystery. Now, Professor DeArmond, one of the
world's leading prion experts, has told the BBC that inflammation in the
throat area of victims could be the key factor. "All I am trying to do is
search for something that would get the protein into the lymphoreticular
system, particularly into the tonsils, and certainly some irritation there,
injury or inflammation, might have been one way that these 90-odd people
were unlucky," he said. The tonsils are an important focus for research
because they are known to be a reservoir for prions. It is this fact that
has prompted British hospitals to dispose of all surgical implements used in
tonsillectomies, to counter the very slight risk that the equipment could
pass vCJD from one patient to another. But Professor DeArmond said serious
consideration was now being given to the idea that the tonsils were the
route through which the primary infection from cattle to humans occurred.
"Why does it [the infection get into the tonsils for instance and it
doesn't happen in sporadic CJD or any other forms of CJD that we know of.
"Could it be that these patients had a sore throat and they were just
unlucky that they ate a sausage or a meat pie that had a lot of BSE brain
associated with it? "Again, I'm trying to think of any other factor that
would explain why a relatively small number of individuals would get the
disease." With perhaps 30 to 40 percent of the British population having the
genetic make-up susceptible to vCJD infection, and so many contaminated
meals eaten over the years, Professor DeArmond said one could have expected
many more victims to have emerged by now. However, if sore throats had acted
as a contributory, but limiting, factor, it might also explain the age
profile of vCJD victims. "Young people go through a lot of colds and sore
throats that you become immune to later in life," Professor DeArmond said.
"As you get older, you experience more viruses and you reach a stage where
you become less susceptible to these problems."
Researchers in the UK said the ideas expressed by Professor DeArmond were
plausible but nothing had been proven. "The truth is we don't know what the
reason is for the particular age distribution of the vCJD cases that have
been observed so far," said Professor Peter Smith, the Acting Chairman of
the government's Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC). "There
are a lot of changes that take place around adolescence. Other people have
suggested for example that it may be related to the sort of changes in teeth
that take place at around that age - with some dental procedures there may
be a risk. "These are all possible hypotheses but we really don't know."
The UCSF professor is a colleague of Stanley Prusiner, the scientist
honoured with a Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on prions. Californian
researchers are now developing a therapy that will block the action of
infectious prions. The therapy, which has shown promise in the lab, will go
into animal trials in the next 12 months. If these experiments are
successful, they could lead to an effective treatment for spongiform
diseases in humans within 10 years, Professor DeArmond said.
