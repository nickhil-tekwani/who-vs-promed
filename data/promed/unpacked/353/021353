Death toll in dropsy deaths in the Capital rises to 32
Two more people succumbed to dropsy in Delhi raising the death toll to 32.
The Chief Minister, Mr Sahib Singh Verma, said he had written to the Delhi
High Court Chief Justice, asking him to depute a sitting judge for an
inquiry into the epidemic. The judicial probe will cover all aspects,
including lapses, negligence and conspiracy, and fix responsibility. He
said the government would take strong action against the culprits.
Earlier, Delhi health minister, Dr Harsh Vardhan, claimed the situation was
improving. He said 606 persons were undergoing treatment in various
hospital and 877 people have been discharged.
