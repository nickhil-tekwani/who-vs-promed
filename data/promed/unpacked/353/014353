Health officials who suspected tainted tri-tip sickened at least 27
people in September 2008 now have some evidence. _E. coli_ bacteria
found on frozen leftover meat perfectly matches the bacteria found in
stool samples taken from several people who became ill, said Dr Mark
Lundberg, Butte County health officer. He said it's still unclear how
the meat became contaminated.

Hundreds of people attended the barbecue on 6 Sep 2008, which raised
money for the volunteer fire department in Forest Ranch. Afterward, a
number of people became sick with severe stomach cramps and diarrhea.
4 people got so ill they had to be hospitalized. Health officials
learned that the sickness was caused by a dangerous strain called _E.
coli_ O157:H7.

Interviews with people who attended the event led officials to
conclude the tri-tip was contaminated and made people sick. However,
they couldn't be sure until the link was proven by test results from
the state lab, Lundberg said in a phone interview on Monday [6 Oct
2008]. It's still not known how the cooked meat became contaminated,
he said, and it may never be known.

Food preparers at the event had the right equipment and, according to
interviews, seemed to do everything right, he said, but obviously
something went wrong.

When large amounts of food are prepared there is the potential for
contamination, he said. It's possible the cooked meat came into
contact with juices from the raw meat. Or possibly, he said, someone
who helped prepare the food was sick and didn't wash his or her hands properly.

[The tri-tip, a small triangular cut of beef from the bottom sirloin,
may well have been contaminated, with for example raw ground beef,
after cooking and cooling. If not, it is remarkable that the
suspected vehicle in this is steak and not ground beef or another vehicle.

Tri-tip (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tri-tip>) often labeled "Santa
Maria steak" appears to be most popular in the Central Coast region
of California. The traditional Santa Maria style of cooking is
grilling at low heat over a red oak pit.

As noted in a past posting (E. coli O157, frozen steaks - USA
(Midwest): recall 20030701.1617), the bacteria associated with steak
are usually external, meaning that the pathogen would be killed by
heat, which might not inactivate internal bacteria. In that posting,
the meat had been injected with tenderizers so that the _E. coli_
could be inoculated internally. This is another example of a
technique developed to fool Mother Nature, which produced more
collective harm than individual good.

Forest Ranch is located in Butte County, California located in the
state's Central Valley, north of the state capital, Sacramento. The
county can be found on a map at
