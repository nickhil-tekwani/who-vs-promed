Avian influenza returns to the Omsk region
------------------------------------------
During the course of laboratory investigations H5N1 avian influenza virus
was isolated from the carcasses of wild birds at 14 lakes in the Omsk
region. [Map at <http://russiatrek.org/r_omsk.shtml>].
According to the Directorate of the Federal Service for Veterinary and
Phyto-sanitary Supervision for the Novosibirsk oblast, all foci of avian
influenza in domestic poultry have been eradicated in the territory of the
Siberian federal district in Russia.
In addition a complex of anti-epizootic measures has been implemented to
eradicate avian flu foci in wild birds at one site, namely the lake of
Ubsa-Nur in the Republic Tyva. [What is avian-influenza "eradication" in
wild birds? Clarification would help. - Mod.AS]
Following the completion of the control measures required, quarantine
measures have been withdrawn in other, earlier infected, regions of the
Siberian Federal district.
According to information obtained from the press-service of the Federal
service for veterinary and phyto-sanitary supervision, 8 million domestic
birds are maintained in the zones at risk, while more than 10 million birds
have already been preventively vaccinated. This includes vaccination of
poultry in 7 rural areas within the Novosibirsk region which are not
regarded as being at immediate risk but are located on transit routes of
poultry and poultry products.
During earlier spring and summer months, H5N1 was detected in 5 regions of
the Siberian federal district -- the regions Altay, Krasnoyarsk,
Novosibirsk and Tomsk, and the republic of Tyva.
