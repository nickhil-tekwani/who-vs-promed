Democratic Republic of Congo has confirmed 2 new cases of Ebola, including one far from the centre of the outbreak, provincial Health Minister Eugene Nzanzu Salita said on Thursday [18 Feb 2021].

The cases were found in Katwa and in Manguredjipa, which is about 150 km (93 miles) west of the city of Butembo, where all the previous cases have been clustered.

One of the new cases was a known contact of another patient, but investigations are under way for the 2nd to know how he might have been infected, said Salita.

Congo has now confirmed a total of 6 Ebola cases and 2 deaths since it declared a resurgence of the disease on 7 Feb [2021].

[2] Guinea and Congo DR: Ebola response gains steam

With both Guinea and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) reporting Ebola recurrences just a week apart, the World Health Organization (WHO) today [Thu 18 Feb 2021] said it is deploying 100 staff and, for Guinea specifically, has released USD 1.25 million to support local control efforts and prepare neighboring countries for possible spread.

The WHO's African regional office also shared more details about the cluster in Guinea, where the total currently stands at 7 cases, 3 of them confirmed and 4 listed as probable. (Two days ago, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention listed the totals at 17 cases and 5 deaths.)

In an update late yesterday [Wed 17 Feb 2021], the WHO said 2 patients with confirmed infections are hospitalized in isolation, one in Conakry, the country's capital, and one Gouecke in N'Zerekore prefecture. Five have died, including the index patient, a nurse from N'Zerekore prefecture in the southeast, the same area where West Africa's massive 2014-2016 outbreak began.

Earlier this week, health officials said initial analysis showed the virus involved in the cluster is from the Zaire subtype, the same one involved in the country's earlier outbreak. However, genetic analysis is underway to shed more light on the source, such as another introduction from an animal source.

So far, no cases have been detected in other countries, but the WHO said the outbreak area is located at a travel crossroads, so the risk of the virus spreading to countries such as Liberia and Ivory Coast is high.

At a WHO African regional office briefing today [Thu 18 Feb 2021], Matshidiso Moeti, MBBS, the group's director, said more than 11 000 vaccine doses in Geneva are being prepared to ship to Guinea, with more to be shipped from the United States [for a total of approximately 20 000 doses - Mod.LK]. Dr. Mohamed Lamine Yansane, senior advisor to Guinea's health ministry, said samples are leaving Conakry today [Thu 18 Feb 2021] for further sequences in Senegal. He said the 1st vaccine doses are due in Guinea on 21 Feb [2021], with immunization to start the following day [Mon 22 Feb 2021].

Also, today [Thu 18 Feb 2021] at a WHO briefing in Geneva, Mike Ryan, MD, who leads its health emergencies program, said that work is underway to form a coordinated vaccination strategy in African countries, which includes the Merck vaccine that has been used successfully in ring vaccination activities. He also said it's possible that the strategy could include the Johnson & Johnson vaccine for related efforts, such as vaccinating healthcare workers in the region.

In the DRC, where the number of cases remains at 4 [now 6 - Mod.LK], vaccination began earlier this week in Butembo.

So far, one symptomatic person traveled by taxi to Conakry, where 290 contacts have been identified, of which 94% have been evaluated, according to Moeti. Ryan added that no cases have been detected outside of Guinea, and officials are on heightened alert.

In a separate statement, the WHO detailed plans to scale up the response to the Guinea and DRC outbreaks. It will have more than 100 staff on the ground by the end of February [2021], starting with a team of 8 from the WHO African regional office who are leaving soon.

"Our collective, quick action is crucial to averting an uncontrolled spread of Ebola amid the COVID-19 pandemic, which has already pushed health workers and health facilities to the edge," Moeti said.

In other developments,
- a humanitarian flight arrived on N'Zerekore on 15 Feb [2021], carrying medical equipment donated by the WHO and its partners;

- in the DRC, 20 WHO experts are already on the ground, and nearly 70 people have already been vaccinated;

- along with the USD 1.25 million from the WHO for response efforts in Guinea and neighboring countries, the United Nations has disbursed USD 15 million for responses in the Guinea and the DRC, which covers preparedness steps in neighboring countries.

[3] Guinea: 4 outbreaks (Ebola, COVID-19, Yellow Fever, Measles)
Date: Fri 19 Feb 2021 5:30 a.m. PST
Source: Washington Post [abridged, edited]
https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/ebola-guinea-west-africa/2021/02/18/1219a8c0-71ee-11eb-a4eb-44012a612cf9_story.html


When he heard about Ebola resurging in Guinea, cardiologist Fode Kaba hoped his country could dodge catastrophe this time.

The hemorrhagic fever killed more than 11 000 people across this West African nation and 2 neighbors from 2013-2016 in the deadliest outbreak on record. Health-care workers knew what to do when new cases arose this week: trace contacts, isolate the potentially exposed, and warn everyone to take special precautions.

But medical centers are already stretched thin as Guinea confronts the coronavirus pandemic on top of yellow fever and measles outbreaks. People are tired of locking down and losing work in an era of seemingly endless restrictions. And the flare-up emerged where the last epidemic started: a region near the borders with Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Ivory Coast.

"We lost a lot of doctors on the front lines, even my best friend," said Kaba, who treats patients in the capital, Conakry. "The government needs to do more in rural areas where there are poor health centers, poor roads, and poor electricity. The panic is there."

Health officials projected optimism on 14 Feb [2021] when the West African nation declared a new epidemic. Sakoba Keita, head of the National Health Security Agency, estimated Guinea could contain the menace in 6 weeks. Messages of support poured in from all over.

"The world cannot afford to turn the other way," Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said in a statement. "We must do everything in our power to respond quickly, effectively, and with commensurate resources to stop these outbreaks before they become large-scale epidemics."

West Africa has more Ebola-fighting experts than anywhere else on Earth, and Guinea is expected to receive 11 000 Ebola vaccines this weekend from the World Health Organization. Busy markets have shuttered. Weddings and funerals are on pause.

"We are not panicking," said Amie Kaba, a physician in Conakry. "We learned lessons from the last outbreak."

Yet the early details about how Ebola returned have spooked some doctors.

The death toll rose to 6 on Wednesday [17 Feb 2021]. Guinea has counted 10 suspected cases and at least 216 people who interacted with them, but experts say more contacts are likely to emerge.

The nightmare began again with a sick nurse in the town of Gouecke. Authorities are still trying to record every person the nurse encountered on her 10-day quest for help. Someone who attended her burial, for instance, developed symptoms and took a bus to the hospital.

"There are certainly a lot more contacts," said Amer Sattar, a general physician in Conakry who worked on the last Ebola response. "Those people are now impossible to find."

One big obstacle, he said, is a lingering perception that reporting symptoms to the government means certain death. Some fear if they enter an isolation center, they will never come out. Quashing stigma was central to getting the last outbreak under control.

Doctors and nurses, meanwhile, shoulder crushing work schedules. By Thursday [18 Feb 2021] Guinea had confirmed 15 088 coronavirus cases and 85 deaths. (Infections have flattened since record highs in May [2020], but health officials urge vigilance.)

"There is a systemic shortage of health-care workers," Sattar said, "because of the lack of training centers and because the pay is horrendous."

Leaders in Guinea vowed to mend those problems after the last Ebola outbreak. The government pledged to recruit 6000 more health-care workers and boost salaries by 40%. Spending on health care climbed from 4% of the national budget to 8%.

Many of the recruits were sent from the capital to rural areas. Yet they struggled to stick around, according to a 2019 study in the peer-reviewed journal Human Resources for Health. The researchers found absenteeism rates of up to 41% at the small-town medical centers they toured.

"Participants reported that the staff, purposefully recruited from the capital, was parachuted in underserved areas for just a few months to benefit their civil servant salary," the authors wrote.

A health-care worker described the city recruits as "prepared for anything except staying in rural areas."

One of those rural areas is the epicenter, Gouecke, which is 533 miles from Guinea's capital.

Ivory Coast sits to the east, Liberia is just south, and Sierra Leone borders on the west. All 3 have ramped up epidemiological surveillance at the frontier, aiming to avoid the kind of cross-border contamination that set off the explosion of infections in 2014. (The index case, a toddler thought to be infected by a bat, exhibited symptoms in December 2013.)

Teams from the United Nations and WHO are bolstering the response in the epicenter, while ringing the alarm about another Ebola outbreak in Congo. (The Central African nation has confirmed [6] cases and 2 deaths.)

The pandemic has already "pushed health workers and health facilities to the edge," said Matshidiso Moeti, WHO's regional director for Africa.

More than 28 000 people contracted Ebola before the West Africa's epidemic ended.

One was [FAC], 51, who lives near the town where the nurse died. The virus killed 13 of his family members.

"The news that Ebola is back is scaring me at night," said Camara, a fruit seller. "I haven't been able to sleep for the past few days." Loss haunts him. He flips through the local news and sees politicians weaving through maskless crowds. "Tell me how I can protect myself from Ebola and corona when our leaders aren't wearing masks?" he said. "May God save Guinea."

"Abstract
-----------
Background
The state of the Guinean health workforce is one of the country's bottlenecks in advancing health outcomes. The impact of the 2014-2015 Ebola virus disease outbreak and resulting international attention has provided a policy window to invest in the workforce and reform the health system. This research constitutes a baseline study on the health workforce situation, professional education, and retention policies in Guinea. The study was conducted to inform capacity development as part of a scientific collaboration between Belgian and Guinean health institutes aiming to strengthen public health systems and health workforce development. It provides initial recommendations to the Guinean government and key actors.

Methodology
The conceptual framework for this study is inspired by Gilson and Walt's health policy triangle. The research consists of a mixed-methods approach with documents and data collected at the national, regional, and district levels between October 2016 and March 2017. Interviews were conducted with 57 resource persons from the Ministry of Health, other ministries, district health authorities, health centers and hospitals, health training institutions, health workers, community leaders, NGO representatives, and development partners. Quantitative data included figures obtained from 7 health professionals' schools in each administrative region of Guinea. A quantitative analysis was conducted to determine the professional graduate trends by year and type of personnel. This provided for a picture of the pool of professional graduates available in the regions in relation to the actual employment possibilities in rural areas. The districts of Forecariah and Yomou were chosen as the main study sites.

Results
Limited recruitment and a relative overproduction of medical doctors and nurse assistants have led to unemployment of health personnel. There was a mismatch between the number of civil servants administratively deployed and those actually present at their health posts. Participants argued for decentralization of health workforce management and financing. Collaboration between government actors and development partners is required to anticipate problems with the policy implementation of new health workers' deployment in rural areas. Further privatization of health education has to meet health needs and labor market dynamics." - Mod.LK]

[3] Liberia (Monrovia)
- Thu 18 Feb 2021. Suspect case
[Global News Network Liberia, abridged, edited]
https://gnnliberia.com/2021/02/18/liberia-health-ministry-reportedly-investigating-ebola-suspected-case-in-monrovia/

According to a report that has now been highlighted on social media, the reported suspected case of Ebola from Guinea last evening, 17 Feb 2021, is reportedly being treated at the Redemption Hospital awaiting testing.

According to the report, Dr. Mohammed Swaray, who treated the suspected case of a lady at Medicover Clinic, Soul Clinic Branch, has been in self-isolation, while the clinic has been placed under surveillance. The relatives of the patient, who escorted the lady from Guinea to the clinic, have been asked to keep in isolation until otherwise.

The patient returned from Nzerkoure, one of the troubled spots in Guinea, a few days ago with a high fever and running stomach and was on medication at a local clinic around the FDA Community in Paynesville for about 3 days before going to Medicover Clinic.

There has been no confirmation of this report, but health authorities in Monrovia say they are investigating this report. The investigation continues.

- Fri 19 Feb 2021. Case tests negative for Ebola
[Liberia Broadcasting system, abridged, edited]
https://elbcradio.com/2021/02/19/suspected-ebola-patient-from-guinea-tested-negative/

Health Minister Dr. Wilhelmina Jallah says the 25-year-old female, who travelled from Guinea recently, has come out negative for Ebola. Minister Jallah said they conducted both Ebola and COVID-19 tests on the patient, who was showing symptoms of COVID-19 after traveling from Guinea. However, Dr. Jallah said they are still awaiting the result of the COVID-19 test.

The patient is currently in the isolated unit at the Redemption Hospital in New Kru Town.

Minister Jallah is, meanwhile, calling on the public not to panic, but to remain on high alert and take all the necessary precautions.
