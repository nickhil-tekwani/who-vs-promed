Researchers have found that strains of bird flu found in Korea and
Japan this year [2008] are almost genetically the same. The National
Veterinary Research and Quarantine Service said Wednesday [21 May
2008] that the genetic makeup of a strain of bird flu sampled from
chickens in Gimje, South Jeolla Province was 99.7 percent identical
to a sample from swans found in Japan's Akita prefecture. The finding
gives grounds to analysis that the latest outbreak of avian influenza
may have originated from migratory birds.

The highest bird flu alert status has been declared in Rimbo Mulyo
village in Rimbo Bujang district, Tebo regency, Jambi province [on
the east coast of central Sumatra], during the past 3 days after the
sudden deaths of thousands of domestic birds in the area.

The alert means local people, especially those living on Jalan 15 and
Jalan 23, where the sudden deaths occurred, are obliged to report to
the local community health center every hour as a precaution.

The regency health office has set up a special task force to
anticipate the possible transfer of the bird flu virus to humans by
conducting door-to-door health checks.

"We're also calling on all members of the community to report to the
community health centers should their neighbors, friends, or family
members become sick," head of Tebo health office Haflin said Tuesday
[20 May 2008].

Haflin said his office has worked hand in hand with the husbandry
office to take preventive measures including providing [veterinary]
vaccines, spraying disinfectant, and culling possibly infected poultry.

Disinfectant has been sprayed and medicine distributed within a 1 km
(o.6 mi) radius of the areas where the sudden deaths occurred, head
of Tebo husbandry office Alfred said.

[Indonesia declared that HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza)
H5N1 had become endemic in its "final report" to the OIE (World
Organisation for Animal Health), dated 26 Sep 2006; see at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=5887>.

For an explanatory note on the meaning of "final reports" to OIE,
subscribers are referred to the commentary in the ProMED-mail posting
"African swine fever - Caucasus, FAO update 20080522.1692."

The outbreaks in Japan and Korea are, reportedly, "continuing."
