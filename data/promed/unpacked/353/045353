Background information on Anthrax in Kazakhstan
Most cases of human anthrax are reported during May to November, with a
peak during July to August. 74 percent of cases are acquired from cattle
and 14 percent from sheep or goats.
Kazakhstan accounted for approximately 12 percent of cases reported for the
former Soviet Union during 1983 to 1989.
A major military [biological production] plant had been located on
Vozroshdeniye Island during the Soviet era. [This is in the Aral Sea on the
western border of Kazakhstan. The island recently underwent a massive
decontamination process. - Mod.MHJ]
5 outbreaks were reported from Kazakhstan (Akzhar and Dzhambul) in 1997; 2
in 1998. A total of 78 'incidents' of human anthrax were reported during
April 1997 to October 1998.
4214 cases were reported during 1958 to 1998. 51 cases of human anthrax
were reported in 1985; 28 in 1990; 20 in 1995; 23 in 1996; 70 during
January to September 1997; 15 in 1998; 9 in 1999; 34 in 2000 (33 of these
in the southern region). 13 cases were reported in 2001 (11 of these in the
south). Rates per 100 000: 2.4 in 1966; 0.42 in 1997; 0.1 in 1999; 34 in 2000.
