Nova Scotia mumps outbreak hits 715 cases
-----------------------------------------
There are 9 new cases of mumps in Nova Scotia this week, bringing the total
number to 715 since the outbreak began last winter, the Department of
Health Promotion and Protection said on Friday [2 Nov 2007]. Dr Shelly
Sarwal, the province's medical officer of health, said last week that
between 10 and 20 new cases have been reported each week since the outbreak
started in February, with a jump since students went back to class.

Since schools reopened in September there have been 129 new cases in the
province. The increase was not unexpected because a second round of
vaccinations has yet to fully kick in, Dr Sarwal said. In July, the
province announced Nova Scotia's post-secondary and Grade 12 students would
be offered a second dose of mumps, measles and rubella vaccine.

The mumps can be spread through coughing, sneezing and exchanging of saliva
through kissing or sharing drinks. Symptoms include aches, pains, fever and
loss of appetite. In extreme cases, mumps can lead to meningitis,
inflammation of the testicles or ovaries, hearing loss and, according to
the Canadian Medical Association Journal, reduced male fertility.

Dr Sarwal said last week it could be weeks before the mumps outbreak is
brought under control. For more information, see:

[Cases of mumps have declined significantly in Canada since the
introduction of vaccination programs against the disease in the early
1970s. This year, a mumps outbreak centred in the Maritime province has
affected 9 Canadian provinces, and revealed gaps in MMR (mumps, measles and
rubella) triple vaccine coverage.

In the early 1950s, an average of 34 000 cases of mumps were reported each
year. By the late 1990s, the average number of cases had declined to less
than 400 per year. Occurrence of the disease declined further following the
introduction in 1996-97 of a second dose of the MMR vaccine for measles
control. The second dose was introduced for children at either 18 months of
age or 4-6 years of age, depending on the jurisdiction.

It is felt that most people over 40 have natural immunity to mumps through
previous exposure to the virus. It is possible, however, that individuals
who have not received a second dose of the vaccine dose may experience
diminishing levels of immunity, and may be susceptible to the virus. In
addition, some individuals may never have been vaccinated. For this reason,
individuals between the ages of 12 or 17 (depending on the jurisdiction)
and 40 years are considered to be among the most susceptible to mumps
infection.

Five mumps outbreaks have been reported in the past decade in Canada.
Outbreaks of the same strain of mumps virus that is currently occurring in
Canada have also been reported in the United States and United Kingdom.
