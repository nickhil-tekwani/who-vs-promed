A 2nd outbreak of measles recorded in an educational institution in the Astrakhan Oblast
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some students at Astrakhan State University (ASU) have been admitted to the Regional Infectious Diseases Hospital with a diagnosis of measles virus infection, according to Svetlana Smrnova, the Deputy Minister of Health. This is the 2nd occasion in recent years that cases of measles virus infection in an educational institution have resulted in hospitalisation.

At the beginning of September [2013] a student from Dagestan was diagnosed with measles virus infection and was quarantined in the Astrakhan Medical Academy (ASMA). Subsequently 27 students were diagnosed with measles virus infection by laboratory investigation. As a consequence, on the basis of these cases, more than 5200 people, including more than 3000 students, were vaccinated against measles.

An extensive survey was undertaken to differentiate measles cases from other infectious diseases on the basis of clinical features. Measures were undertaken to restrict the outbreak to the one institution and to undertake supplementary vaccination to prevent further spread of the outbreak.

"We have determined now that the focus of the outbreak is confined to the sick students in the ASU. Mass immunisation and 'daily checkups' have been initiated to prevent spread of the outbreak to any other institution."

Measles cases in England up to the end of August [2013]
-------------------------------------------------------
For the 4th successive month the number of laboratory confirmed cases of measles in England has declined, with only 21 cases confirmed in August [2013], bringing the number reported since the start of the year to 1386 cases. In August, South-West region reported the most cases (8), almost all of which were associated with an on-going outbreak in the area of a new D8 strain, MVs/Bristol.GBR/21.13. There was a smaller cluster of cases in Yorkshire and Humber region of a B3 strain, MVs/Bradford.GBR/26.13. Sporadic cases of MVs/Taunton.GBR/27.12 continue to be identified.

So far this year, 274 (20 percent) cases have been associated with primary and secondary school outbreaks. Small outbreaks have also been reported from "hard-to-reach" populations with known low vaccine coverage such as the travelling community [Roma] and the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community in north London [see ProMED-mail measles update 39]. Overall 294 (21 percent) of all cases in 2013 were admitted to hospital; 46 reported complications including pneumonia, meningitis and gastroenteritis.

As previously reported, the shift towards cases in secondary school age groups during 2013 is likely to be due to the fall in routine vaccine coverage of MMR between 1999 and 2005. To reduce the risk of larger outbreaks of measles in the next academic year, Public Health England, the Department of Health and NHS England announced an MMR catch-up programme in late April. The campaign has targeted children aged between 10 and 16 years who have a record of none or incomplete MMR vaccination. Returns from the NHS Areas Teams confirm that almost 5000 practices have already signed up to participate in the programme. The service involves sending letters from general practices inviting under-vaccinated children to attend the surgery for vaccination. The primary target population was the estimated 8 percent of that age group who had received no vaccine (around 1/3rd of a million). Secondary targets included a similar number of that age group who had received one dose of MMR, and a similar number of children in other age groups.

Data has been extracted from approximately 4400 practices (around half of the total) on the MMR status of children turning 10 to 16 years of age in August 2013. Comparing this with children aged 9-15 years in 2012, it suggests that the proportion recorded as unvaccinated fell by around 1.8 percent (representing around 42 500 children in the participating practices). If this progress was replicated nationally this suggests that around 78 000 unvaccinated children have received MMR since last year [2012]. The proportion recorded as having received 2 doses of MMR has increased by 2.5 percent. Although some of this may represent data cleaning, this scale of increase is consistent with the vaccine ordering data, which suggests that around 200 000 extra doses have been used. So far, most vaccination has been conducted in primary care, although schools campaigns were conducted in response to local outbreaks in many areas during the last academic year. Plans are being developed to sustain these activities and to undertake specific programmes in some schools during the next 2 terms.

[It is clear from the initial statement that: "For the 4th successive month the number of laboratory confirmed cases of measles in England has declined, with only 21 cases confirmed in August, bringing the number reported since the start of the year to 1386 cases" -- the 2013 measles outbreak in England (and probably the remainder of the United Kingdom) has passed its peak and is unlikely to recur to the same extent.

The relevance for future outbreaks of the persistence of more than a single genotype of measles virus is unclear at present. - Mod.CP

Public Health Wales (PHW) said it has received 2 notifications of measles in pupils at Cwmtawe School with one case laboratory confirmed. It comes 3 months after Wales' biggest measles outbreak ended. The 1st cases in Swansea were reported last November [2012] before spreading to mid Wales. More than 75 000 were vaccinated during the outbreak throughout Wales. But experts say more than 30 000 children in the 10 to 18 age group still remain unvaccinated.

Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board is arranging for MMR vaccinations to be offered next week to all pupils at the school who are not fully vaccinated. Of 1260 pupils, 62 are recorded as having received no doses of the MMR vaccine and 142 have received only one dose.

PHW communicable disease control consultant Dr Jorg Hoffmann said: "This case of measles comes only 3 months after the end of Wales' biggest ever measles outbreak... so we are obviously concerned and want to act quickly. "We have written today to all parents of unvaccinated children in Cwmtawe School to urge them to arrange for their children to be vaccinated. "In the meantime, to prevent the spread of infection, we would urge parents of any children who become unwell with measles-like symptoms over the weekend to keep them at home and seek medical advice, and not to allow them to attend events where other children will be present."

By the time the outbreak was declared over after 6 months, it had resulted in 1219 notifications of measles cases in the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg, Hywel Dda and Powys health board areas. Some 88 people visited a hospital due to measles during the outbreak. A 25-year-old man from Swansea, died from pneumonia after contracting measles at the height of the epidemic.

18th measles case confirmed in Queensland
-----------------------------------------
In the latest case, the infected person visited Ipswich police station and the Ipswich Courthouse a number of times between 23 and 27 Sep 2013 as well as UFS pharmacy at Booval on 26 Sep 2013.

Public health physician Dr Heidi Carroll says those who have visited these areas should be alert for measles symptoms, particularly if they have not been vaccinated against the potentially deadly disease.

The new case was the 8th in the Ipswich area this year [2013], Dr Carroll said.

9th case of measles confirmed in Ipswich
----------------------------------------
Health officials expect more cases to be confirmed before the outbreak ends. A total of 8 of the 9 confirmed cases have been in adults, with one baby also suffering the disease. West Moreton Hospital and Health Service public health physician Dr Heidi Carroll said any adult with 2 doses of the Measles Mumps Rubella [vaccine] is 99 per cent immune.

Dr Carroll said a higher vaccination rate amongst adults would help prevent the outbreak spreading. "Adults who were born in 1966 or later and who do not have documentation of having received measles vaccine, or having had the infection, are particularly at risk of contracting the disease, in the current outbreak setting." Dr Carroll said it was unlikely the measles outbreak could become wide-spread. According to West Moreton-Oxley Medicare local, 94.45 per cent of children under the age of 5 have been vaccinated. Measles symptoms usually start around 10 days after infection. But symptoms can occur between 7 and 18 days after infection.

Health Minister Lawrence Springborg said with the eradication of so many diseases in the past generation, some parts of the community have forgotten how serious those diseases are. He said parents who don't vaccinate their children put the health of their own children and others at risk. Children can receive the measles vaccination from 12 months [of age].

The 1st measles case was confirmed by health officials on 6 Sep 2013; 2 weeks later 4 cases had been confirmed, with the 8th and 9th detected this week [week of 30 Sep 2013]. The symptoms of measles are usually treated with rest, plenty of fluids, and paracetamol.
