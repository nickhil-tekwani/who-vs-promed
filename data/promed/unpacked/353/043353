Dr. Guido Sanchez, Head of the Departmental Health Service (SEDES,
according to its Spanish initials), confirmed the death of an
8-year-old girl as a result of rabies virus infection, and, therefore,
health authorities will maintain a sanitary alert in the whole
department. This may be the 1st case of laboratory-confirmed human
rabies this year [2011].

"Laboratory examinations confirmed that the death of this girl was
caused by rabies virus. A sample of her brain tissue was sent to our
laboratory in Quillacollo. Tests have been reported as positive, so
this is the 1st confirmed case of human rabies. We also have reported
15 cases of canine rabies and a case of rabies in a monkey," reported
Dr. Sanchez.

The health officer also explained that the deceased child apparently
did not find bite marks on her body, so the likely transmission might
have been through contact with saliva of the infected animal.

"Since the girl did not show bite marks, we suppose that the virus
was present in the saliva of the animal, sometimes pets kiss humans on
their lips, sometimes pets lick humans, and also sometimes we stroke
our pets, and we do not wash our hands afterwards; the virus may be
dispersed in the air, and we have to maintain hygienic conditions in
order to fight the virus," said Dr. Sanchez.

Because of the sanitary alert declared in the department, Dr. Sanchez
confirmed that next May [2011 or 2012?], a general vaccination
campaign will be carried out, covering the whole department. "We
programmed for next May the 1st canine rabies vaccination campaign for
all our department. We expect to immunize 150 000 pets, including
dogs, cats, and monkeys; however, we request people not wait until the
last days of the campaign. Pets must be vaccinated from the very 1st
month and once every year. We do have plenty of free-of-charge vaccine
available in our health center," explained Dr. Sanchez.

The health officer recommended that people go as soon as possible to
a health center if they are attacked (bitten) by unknown animals or by
pets presenting with suspicious symptoms. "When animals are infected
by the rabies virus, they may become quite friendly, or they may be
aggressive; they may hide in dark places; they may not be willing to
eat; they may be afraid of water, so these are signals that the
animals may be incubating the rabies virus, and owners must be alert
so immediate intervention and specialized assessments can be carried
out," he explained.

Dr. Sanchez added that, in case rabies virus infection is confirmed,
persons must undergo medical therapy for 7 days (post-exposure
prophylaxis) using injected vaccines and medical follow-up, which are
given free of charge in every public health center.

[The source of the child's infection has not been resolved. Perhaps
infection by contact with an infected bat should be considered a
possibility. Contact with bats, of either the vampire or non-vampire
species, can often leave little evidence of physical injury. Genotypic
analysis of the rabies virus isolated from the nervous tissue of the
deceased child might identify the vector of the virus. Further
information would be welcomed.

Cochabamba is a city in central Bolivia, located in a valley bearing
the same name in the Andes mountain range. It is the capital of the
Cochabamba department. It can be located on the map of Bolivia at:
