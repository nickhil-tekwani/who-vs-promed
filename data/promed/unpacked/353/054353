- 11:35 GMT - Philippines: Highest single-day increase
The Philippine government's COVID-19 task force confirmed 3954 new infections, the country's largest single-day increase in new coronavirus cases. The information on the surge in infections, which was a sharp increase from the record 2539 cases confirmed on [8 Jul 2020], was mentioned in a regular circular issued by the inter-agency task force. The health ministry was expected to release further details later on [Thu 30 Jul 2020].

- 10:30 GMT - China: Urumqi imposes COVID-19 restrictions
Authorities imposed travel restrictions on people coming in and out of Urumqi, the capital of China's western Xinjiang region, seeking to contain an outbreak of the coronavirus there. The city has been at the centre of the new wave of infections in mainland China, accounting for 96 of 105 confirmed COVID-19 cases reported on [29 Jul 2020]. Non-residents seeking to leave the city will have to test negative in both nucleic acid and antibody tests before they can leave if they have been in the city for 14 days or more, Vice Mayor Song Yajun said during a daily briefing. He added that residents should not leave Urumqi unless necessary. Urumqi will also mandate 14-day quarantine for people arriving in the city from high-risk COVID-19 areas, Song said. Others entering the city will need to show proof of a negative test within the past 7 days, among other requirements, which vary depending on where they are coming from.

- 10:25 GMT - Iran: Number of coronavirus cases passes 300 000
The number of infections from the new coronavirus in Iran has reached 301 530, according to official Health Ministry figures announced on state TV. The alarming surge in daily fatalities has sent shockwaves across Iran as the healthcare system is already overwhelmed [EPA]. Iran has the Middle East's highest number of recorded COVID-19 cases and infections and deaths have risen sharply since restrictions on movement began to be eased in mid-April [2020]. There were 226 deaths from the new coronavirus in the past 24 hours, taking the total number of deaths from the pandemic to 16 569.

- 10:20 GMT - Czech Republic: Coronavirus spike, cases top 16 000
Cases of the new coronavirus in the Czech Republic have surpassed 16 000 as a recent spike in infections continues, Health Ministry data showed. The central European country of 10.7 million has faced a rise in cases in July [2020] in several hot spots, including in an eastern mining region and more recently in the capital Prague, which reported a daily record of 101 cases on [Tue 28 Jul 2020]. The ministry recorded 278 cases nationwide on [Wed 29 Jul 2020], the 2nd-highest daily rise in July [2020]. The 7-day average reached 216, the highest since [10 Apr 2020]. In total, the country has seen 16 093 cases since the outbreak started in March [2020], with 11 429 recoveries so far and 374 deaths from the COVID-19 illness.

- 07:45 GMT - Russia: Over 5500 new coronavirus cases
Russia reported 5509 new cases of the novel coronavirus, pushing its national tally to 834 499, the world's 4th-largest caseload. Officials said 129 people had died in the last 24 hours, bringing the official death toll to 13 802.

- 09:24 GMT - Pakistan: Downward trajectory of active coronavirus cases
Pakistan's downward trajectory of active cases of the coronavirus continued, with the number of such cases dropping to 25 253, the lowest since [12 May 2020]. Overall, there were 1114 new cases registered on [Wed 29 Jul 2020], taking the countrywide total tally of cases since the outbreak began in late February [2020] to 277 402. At least 36 patients died in the last 24 hours, official data shows, bringing the total death toll to 6018. With the Muslim festival of Eid-ul-Adha to be held over the weekend, authorities in Pakistan are continuing to ask citizens to maintain strict social distancing guidelines, to avoid a repeat of an explosion of cases over Eid-ul-Fitr, just over 2 months ago.

- 08:23 GMT - India: Daily coronavirus cases top 50 000
India has reported more than 50 000 daily coronavirus cases for the 1st time. There were 52 123 new cases in the previous 24 hours, according to federal health data, taking the total number of infections to almost 1.6 million. Some 775 people died of COVID-related conditions over the same period, raising total deaths now just under 35 000, low compared to the total number of cases, but showing little sign of slowing. While major cities like New Delhi and Mumbai have seen their cases ease, infections in rural areas are continuing to rise sharply, alarming experts who fear weak healthcare systems there will be unable to cope. India has the 3rd-highest number of infections globally, behind the United States and Brazil.

- 07:25 GMT - Hong Kong: Virus ban on restaurant dining reversed
Hong Kong reversed a day-old ban on restaurants serving dine-in customers -- introduced to control the spread of coronavirus -- following widespread public anger. All restaurants in the city of 7.5 million were ordered to only serve takeaways as part of a raft of ramped-up social distancing measures aimed at combating a fresh wave of virus cases. But social media was quickly swamped by photos of primarily blue-collar workers forced to eat on pavements and parks and even inside public toilets to escape a torrential downpour. On [Thu 30 Jul 2020] city authorities published new guidelines saying restaurants could operate dine-in facilities, but only during the day, at half capacity, and with no more than 2 people to a table.

- 06:35 GMT - Poland: May quarantine returnees from some EU, non-EU states
Poland may reinstate quarantine measures for people returning home from some countries, a government spokesman said, after recent data showing a spike in coronavirus infections. Citing Spain and France as countries triggering concerns about the coronavirus, he said the government may announce its decision within days if the epidemic spikes in a particular country. Poland is also experiencing a resurgence in the number of coronavirus infections. On [Sat 25 Jul 2020] the number hit 584, the 2nd-highest daily tally since the beginning of the pandemic. On [Wed 29 Jul 2020] the ministry reported 512 new cases bringing the total number to 44 416. So far there have been 1694 documented deaths from COVID-19 in the country of 38 million.

- 06:10 GMT - Ukraine: Daily high of 1197 new coronavirus cases
Ukraine reported a record daily high of 1197 new coronavirus cases on [30 Jul 2020], the country's council of security and defense said. The number of new daily infections has increased sharply in the past 2 months following the gradual lifting of restrictions that began in late May [2020]. The total number of cases rose to 68 794, including 1673 deaths and 38 154 recovered as of 30 Jul [2020].

- 06:01 GMT - Japan: Spike in coronavirus cases
Japan is bracing for a surge in the number of coronavirus infection after fresh cases exceeded the 1000 mark for the 1st time. Tokyo confirmed 367 new coronavirus infections, national broadcaster NHK said, topping the previous record of 366 cases on [23 Jul 2020]. Japan had 1264 new cases on [Wed 29 Jul 2020], according to NHK, surpassing the previous record of 981, with infections spreading rapidly not only in Tokyo, but also in other regions, including remote islands. Northern Japan's Iwate prefecture, which had been the last-remaining prefecture free from coronavirus infection, had its 1st cases on [Wed 29 Jul 2020], while the southern island of Okinawa had 44 infections, hitting a record for the 3rd day in a row.

- 05:00 GMT - US: Johns Hopkins researchers call for "reset" in US pandemic response
With US cases and deaths continuing to climb, researchers at Johns Hopkins University are calling for a "reset" of the country's coronavirus response. "The COVID-19 pandemic is a challenge far beyond what any one state, territory, or community can handle alone," they said. "It is only our collective action that will generate the change necessary to regain control of this epidemic, avoid cascading crises in our healthcare system and economy, and save great numbers of lives throughout the United States."

- 04:30 GMT - Vietnam: Hanoi plans mass testing in wake of Danang outbreak
Authorities in Hanoi, the Vietnamese capital, say they will test some 21 000 people who recently returned from Danang where an outbreak of coronavirus was confirmed last weekend. Vietnam recorded 9 new cases on [Thu 30 Jul 2020] morning, one of which was in Hanoi and the rest in the central city of Danang, a popular holiday destination. Authorities in Hanoi have also imposed a ban on mass gatherings and the closure of all bars and nightclubs.

- 03:30 GMT - Australia: Highest number of cases
Australia has reported the highest number of confirmed cases since the coronavirus pandemic began. The state of Victoria is the worst-hit with outbreaks centered around care homes and workplaces in Melbourne and its sprawling suburbs. State authorities reported 723 new cases on [Thu 30 Jul 2020] and 13 deaths. "Today is not a good day," Victoria state Premier Dan Andrews said in a statement. He noted that while most cases in the state were in Melbourne and the suburbs, there had been a "significant jump" in cases in regional communities, which warranted additional measures to curb the disease's spread. Mandatory mask wearing extended across the state from [Sun 2 Aug 2020], and in some areas, residents will not be allowed to go to other people's houses or have visitors to their own home. Internal borders have been closed to help curb the spread of the virus beyond Victoria. The state of Queensland in the northeast earlier announced 3 new cases; 2 of the people are thought to have been exposed to the virus in Sydney.

00:15 GMT - Australia's Victoria state: to report more than 700 cases, 13 deaths
The local media in Australia is reporting that the state of Victoria, the epicentre of a new wave of coronavirus in the country, will report more than 700 cases and 13 deaths on [Thu 30 Jul 2020] morning.

- 03:20 GMT - PNG: Coronavirus situation worsening
An Australian medical emergencies team has been deployed to Papua New Guinea, where the outbreak has deteriorated in recent days. AFP news agency says the country's pandemic response centre was closed yesterday [Wed 29 Jul 2020] after a senior adviser was diagnosed with the virus, and the health minister is also being tested. The situation in Papua New Guinea is fraught. Cases are growing; testing and treatment are near capacity. Yesterday [Wed 29 Jul 2020] the COVID-19 crisis response centre was shut after a senior health advisor tested positive. Around 100 people are now being tested, including the health minister.

- 01:35 GMT - US: Records a coronavirus death every minute as total surpasses 150 000
One person in the United States died about every minute from COVID-19 as the national death toll surpassed 150 000, the highest in the world, according to Reuters. US coronavirus deaths are rising at their fastest rate in 2 months and have increased by 10 000 in the past 11 days.

- 00:00 GMT - Brazil: Reports record numbers of coronavirus deaths, cases
Brazil's Health Ministry has just confirmed a record of 1595 daily deaths from coronavirus. Taken on a weekly basis (7677 this week), deaths are also at their highest since the pandemic began. The authorities also reported a record number of cases for a single day (69 074), partly as a result of working through a backlog of previously unregistered cases. Despite the accelerating pandemic, the government of President Jair Bolsonaro has moved to ease restrictions to boost the economy, and on [Wed 29 Jul 2020] said a ban on foreign travellers to the country would be lifted.

[2] USA: Experts recommend "reset" coronavirus approach
Date: Thu 30 Jul 2020 10:21 GMT
Source: Al Jazeera [edited]
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/07/johns-hopkins-researchers-urge-reset-coronavirus-approach-200730091140899.html


Scientists in the United States have urged the government to reset its approach to the coronavirus pandemic, warning that the world's hardest-hit country was "not on course to get control" of an outbreak that has so far killed 150 000 people and infected 4.4 million.

[Wed 29 Jul 2020]'s call from researchers at Johns Hopkins University came as the US reported its highest single-day jump in COVID-19 deaths since May [2020], with the states of California, Texas, and Florida all setting one-day records for fatalities.

The scientists' policy brief said that while the US had managed to bring down cases in May [2020] by implementing stringent stay-at-home orders, the current spike in infections was overwhelming hospitals in many parts of the country and "stressing many sectors of society, from business to education to healthcare."

Hospitalisation rates for COVID-19 in most states now match or exceed numbers seen in New York City, the previous epicentre of the outbreak in the country during the peak months of March and April [2020].

"Unlike many countries in the world, the United States is not currently on course to get control of this epidemic. It's time to reset," the brief said, outlining 10 actions required to stem the virus's spread.

Chief among them was a recommendation for the universal use of masks, physical distancing, hand hygiene, and avoidance of large gatherings. "Without having these measures in place, it will be difficult to maintain control of outbreaks or turn the corner on an outbreak that is accelerating," the brief said.

"COVID-19 has reached a point in the United States where these protective actions should no longer be called a matter of individual choice, but measures of societal responsibility."

Stay-at-home orders
-------------------
In areas where the outbreak is worsening, officials must reinstate stay-at-home orders until numbers improve for at least 2 weeks, the brief said. Such a decision will be disruptive, it acknowledged, and therefore leaders must prioritise clear and transparent communications to convey to the public the motivations and anticipated timelines for the closures.

Other recommendations included bolstering supplies of personal protective gear and diagnostic testing kits at healthcare facilities. The scientists also called for better analyses of epidemiological data and scaling up contact tracing across the country.

"The coronavirus pandemic is the most serious epidemic threat to the United States in a century," the brief said. "The United States has reached a critical point in the outbreak trajectory, and serious consideration needs to be given to ways in which the response can be improved. The time is now to move forward to reduce transmission and save lives."

The brief echoes the advice of many health experts who say the US outbreak could be brought under greater control if guidelines to maintain physical distancing and wear masks in public were enforced nationwide.

But President Donald Trump has rejected a federal mask order, and while he was initially reluctant to be seen wearing one, he has recently come round to the idea. The president is also pushing states to fully reopen schools when the academic year begins in the autumn, but teacher unions and local officials have called for students to stay home and for classes to move online.

Experts meanwhile say the new surge in cases is hampering the country's economic recovery effort. "We have seen some signs in recent weeks that the increase in virus cases and the renewed measures to control it are starting to weigh on economic activity," the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, said on [Wed 29 Jul 2020].

[3] Early COVID-19 spread linked to travel
Date: Wed 29 Jul 2020
Source: Contagion Live [edited]
https://www.contagionlive.com/news/early-covid19-cases-linked-china-italy-iran-


A new study published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases suggests that people with travel links to China, Iran, and Italy accounted for nearly 2/3 of initial COVID-19 cases in affected countries.

Data on the early spread of SARS-CoV-2 are limited, and the global epidemiology of confirmed cases outside of mainland China will likely be a point of scientific inquiry for some time due to complex transmission dynamics.

Investigators publishing in The Lancet sought to move this area of epidemiological research forward by compiling information in publicly available reports from the pre-pandemic period leading up to [10 Mar 2020]. Reports were gathered via public health agency websites, transcripts of press conferences, and social media feeds of government agencies. Travel history, exposures to other cases, and case characteristics were noted.

In each of 99 affected countries outside of mainland China, 75 (76%) had recent travel to affected countries. According to investigators, 60 (61%) had travelled to China, Italy, or Iran.

Among 1200 cases examined with age or sex information available, 874 (73%) were early cases. Early cases were defined as within the 1st 100 a country records. Among 762 early cases with age information, the median age was 51 years (IQR 35-63); 25 (3%) of 762 early cases occurred in children younger than 18 years. Additionally, 21 (2%) of these 1200 cases were among healthcare workers.

Out of 101 clusters identified during the pre-pandemic period, the most commonly identified transmission setting was households (76 [75%]; mean 2.6 cases per cluster [range 2-7]). The 2nd and 3rd most common sources of an outbreak appeared to be in non-healthcare occupational settings (14 [14%]; mean 4.3 cases per cluster [2-14]), and large-scale community gatherings (11 [11%]; mean 14.2 cases per cluster [4-36]).

The investigators point out that although close household contact was an overwhelmingly large source of early clusters, clusters in occupational or community settings tended to be large. This means the results should not be taken as an endorsement or rejection of particular outbreak control policies by the authors.

[These countries had been selected based on having had significant surges with SARS-CoV-2 infections but different responses. In some cases, transmission was almost interrupted, but resurgences have occurred, and countries have handled them differently. One observation is that lifting of restrictions has led to major resurgences in some areas; in others, early new threats seem to be importations, but community spread does recur. Good contact tracing has helped to shorten the time with new clusters, and temporary new restrictions have had an impact. Countries not implementing restrictions have done more poorly, with major resurgences. Spain has been added again as it is dealing with a 2nd wave after lifting of restrictions, primarily focused in Catalonia and Aragon. - Mod.UBA]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:

- The Americas region reported 51.8% of the global newly reported cases and 56.5% of newly reported deaths for this 24-hour period, maintaining its dominance as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 8.7 million cases. The USA reported 48.4% of cases (54 022), Brazil 20.8% (23 284), Colombia 7.2% (8125), Mexico 4.5% (4973), Peru 4.4% (4920), Argentina 4.3% (4890), and Chile 1.7% (1877).

- The European region reported 9.7% of the global newly reported cases and 13.3% of the newly confirmed deaths globally. Russia reported 26.1% (5475) of the regional newly confirmed cases, followed by Israel 9.7% (2052), Kazakhstan 7.4% (1544), Romania 5.4% (1151), Ukraine 4.8% (1022), Turkey 4.6% (963), Spain 4.3 % (905), Germany 3.3% (684), France 3.2% (672), Kyrgyzstan 3.2% (668), Uzbekistan 3.1% (663), and the UK 2.7% (581).

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 6.7% of the global newly reported cases and 8.4% of global newly reported fatalities. Iraq reported 21.1% (2747), of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Iran 20.4% (2667), Saudi Arabia 14.5% (1897), Pakistan 8.1% (1063), Oman 6.5% (846), Kuwait 5.9% (770), Morocco 3.8% (500), and Egypt 3.5% (465). Pakistan is decreasing its daily case count steadily during the month of July 2020 (on 1 Jul 2020, Pakistan reported 4133 newly confirmed cases), while at the same time cases are increasing in Iraq, Oman, and Morocco. This region remains highly active, with multiple countries still in a surge mode.

- The African region reported 5.7% of the global newly reported cases and 4.9% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 59.0% (7231) of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Ghana 6.4% (782), Ethiopia 5.3% (653), Algeria 5.2 (642), Nigeria 5.1% (624), Kenya 4.9% (606), Zambia 3.7% (450), and Madagascar 3.4% (414). Since the beginning of July 2020, South Africa has reported daily new case counts of greater than 10 000, 18 of the 28 days, today's (29 Jul 2020) report is a slightly higher than yesterday's 7 097 (28 Jul 2020).

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.6% of the global newly reported cases and 0.23% of global deaths. The Philippines reported 45.1% (1633) of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Japan 25.9% (940), Australia 10.2% (369), Singapore 9.9% (359), China 5.8% (212), and South Korea 1.3% (48).

- The South East Asia region reported 24.9% of the global newly reported cases and 16.4% of global deaths. India reported 90.3% (48 513) of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 5.5% (2960) and Indonesia 3.3% (1748). India continues to be the driving force of the dominance of this region.

Impression: The overall picture is basically the same. The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed cases on a daily basis followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, followed by the Africa region and the Western Pacific region representing the lowest daily caseload of all the regions.

[Comparing today's numbers with yesterday's (28 Jul 2020), the global case count rose by 1.7% in the past 24 hours. The USA and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts, although India has been rapidly increasing, with daily case counts around 50 000. At the rate of daily reporting, we globally passed the 17 million mark today (29 Jul 2020).

In the past 24 hours, Brazil reported 70 869 cases, followed by USA (69 694) and India (52 249). These 3 countries account for half of all confirmed cases globally (50.7%). There were 6735 deaths reported in the past 24 hours.

In descending rank order, the Brazil is number one for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by USA, India, South Africa, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Argentina, Russia, Bangladesh, all known global hotspots. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed cases goes from 3009 to 70 869. Other hotspots are seen in the countries numbered 11-20 in this list: Iraq, Iran, Israel, Chile, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Spain, Kazakhstan and France, and their range of reported new cases is 1392 to 2968.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase of 7.8%, and looking at daily reported deaths, the change is decreased by 7.7%.

Impression: The SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts and mortality. That being said, the most severely affected region is the Americas with cases increasing on a daily basis, even though the comparative 7-day average suggests things may be slowing down (or reporting is slowing down). - Mod.UBA]
