Botswana polio case shocks officials: finding is setback for eradication
effort
-----------------------------------------------
The effort to eradicate polio worldwide by year's end 2004 received a major
jolt yesterday Tue 13 Apr 2004 as health investigators confirmed a new case
in Botswana that they [linked] to northern Nigeria 3000 miles away. The new
case served as a reminder that the threat of polio's spread is ever-present
and spurred Botswana officials to begin planning a nation-wide immunization
program.

"This shows unless the virus is eradicated everywhere, no one is protected
anywhere," Jean-Marie Okwo-Bele, senior adviser for immunization activities
at UNICEF in New York, said in a telephone interview. "As long as we have
a couple of pockets of transmission, we are not safe at all."

The infection of a 7-year-old boy in northeastern Botswana -- the 1st case
in southern Africa since 1997 -- shocked international and local health
officials. Botswana officials said last night -- Tue 13 Apr -- that, in
response, they plan to conduct 2 rounds of house-to-house immunizations
nationwide starting in May 2004 involving all children under the age of 5.
They hope to reach 250 000 children, at a cost close to USD 1 million.

Health officials said they still hope this setback will not block the goal
of eradication by the end of 2004. But they added that much depends on
halting the spread soon in Nigeria, where anti-American sentiment has
fueled suspicion of the vaccine. If they are successful, polio will be only
the 2nd disease affecting humans that has been eradicated, following smallpox.

"It's really still way too premature to [give up on] the 2004 goal, but if we
don't get 2 [immunization] rounds in the spring [of 2004] in northern
Nigeria, it will make it really, really tough," said Bruce Aylward, the World
Health Organization's polio eradication coordinator.

Polio cases around the world have decreased by 99 percent since 1988, when
an estimated 350 000 people were infected. In 2003, 784 cases were
reported, a major drop from 1918 cases in 2002, but still higher than the
figures for 2000 and 2001. In 2003, Nigeria accounted for 45 percent of the
world's cases. In 2004, as of 7 Apr, Nigeria has 48 of the world's 72
reported infections, or 2/3.

Several Muslim and secular leaders in sections of northern Nigeria have
effectively shut down efforts to vaccinate children for polio for nearly a
year because of rumors that the vaccine was tainted in an American plot to
sterilize Muslim children. Some Muslim leaders also have said that even if
the vaccine is safe, they will boycott the immunizations simply because the
United States is a major funder in polio eradication; they say it is their
way of protesting US wars in the predominantly Muslim countries of
Afghanistan and Iraq.

In the face of such opposition, Nigerian and international leaders have
gone to great lengths to convince skeptics the vaccine is safe. A 23-member
panel traveled this year to laboratories in Indonesia, South Africa, and
India, where samples of the vaccine were tested. The committee, which
included 2 officials from the northern Nigerian state of Kano, concluded in
mid-Mar 2004 that the vaccines were safe, but Kano leaders have yet to
comment.

The next immunization in Nigeria is planned for late April 2004. In March
2004, Kano was the only state not to participate.

In contrast to Nigeria, the efforts to eradicate polio have proceeded well
in recent months in India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Egypt, and Niger -- the
other 5 countries where the virus is endemic. In India and Pakistan
particularly, the immunization campaigns have gone better than expected.

"It's pretty exciting progress around the rest of the world," Aylward
said. "Maybe the Botswana case will heighten the need for international
cooperation in attacking the problem in Nigeria."

At first, health officials were not sure whether to believe the lab results
of the Botswana polio case. They hashed out one theory that it could have
come from a contaminated sample in a South African lab which tests samples
from around Africa.

They ordered more tests. Scientists tested the genetic sequencing of the
virus and determined it was a better than 99 percent match with the virus
type found in northern Nigeria. They plan to officially announce the
results today, Wed 14 Apr.

"It is definitely from northern Nigeria," said Deo Nshimirimana, WHO's
regional adviser in Africa for vaccine preventable diseases, in a telephone
interview from Harare, Zimbabwe. "We tested it and re-tested it. The only
way we know it is linked to Nigeria is that the lab shows the virus is
related to the one there."

But no one knows how the 7-year-old boy became infected. The boy,
Nshimirimana said, showed weakness in his limbs, but later recovered and
now is apparently suffering no ill-effects. Only about 10 percent of such
cases do not involve a degree of paralysis.

In Botswana, local investigators canvassed his neighborhood and visited
others who came in contact with him. But officials in Gabarone, the
Botswana capital, said they have found no one who has been to Nigeria
recently or who has been in contact with someone who has traveled there.
The poliomyelitis virus, which affects mainly children and often cripples
their legs and arms, is most often transmitted by drinking water
contaminated by infected feces or by contaminated hands.

"We have not, as a country, confirmed this is an imported case," said Dr.
Patson Mazonde, Botswana's director of health services. "We have teams in
the field. Until their work is done, we will not have a conclusion."

Polio From Nigeria Spreads Further Afield to Botswana - UN Health Agency
------------------------
Underlining the spreading risk to polio-free areas of imported infection
from northern Nigeria where immunization was suspended during 2003, the
United Nations health agency today reported the 1st case in 13 years of the
paralyzing and sometimes fatal disease in the southern African country of
Botswana.

"Children across Africa will continue to be at risk of polio from such
importations until the disease is eradicated everywhere," the Geneva-based
World Health Organization (WHO) said.

The magnitude of the risk posed to polio-free areas is compounded by the
growing vulnerability of populations to polio globally after the cessation
of preventive polio immunization campaigns in most polio-free countries
from 2002 to 2003, it added.

In the past 18 months new cases genetically linked to the poliovirus
endemic to northern Nigeria have occurred in the previously polio-free west
and central African countries of Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central
African Republic, Chad, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana & Togo.

These cases have been associated with an extensive outbreak in Nigeria
after immunization was suspended in some northern states in August 2003,
when religious and other leaders voiced concern over the safety of the oral
vaccine. As of March 2004, all Nigerian states with the exception of Kano
had resumed mass polio immunization.

In the Botswana case a 7-year-old boy from Ngami in the northwest had onset
of paralysis in February 2004. The government, WHO, the UN Children's Fund
(UNICEF) and partners are currently preparing an emergency response,
including heightened disease surveillance and a nationwide immunization
campaign to ensure that any transmission is stopped rapidly.

Neighbouring countries are being notified of the importation, and urged to
further strengthen their surveillance for polio and routine immunization
coverage.

Polio reported in Botswana
-------------------------
A case of paralytic poliomyelitis due to an imported type 1 poliovirus has
been reported in Botswana, a country which had been polio-free since 1991.
The virus has been closely linked genetically to poliovirus endemic to
northern Nigeria. The case -- a 7-year-old boy from the Ngami district of
north-western Botswana -- had onset of paralysis on 8 Feb 2004.

In the past 18 months, wild polioviruses genetically linked to northern
Nigeria have caused new cases of polio in the previously polio-free
countries of Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad,
Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana and Togo. The importations are associated with an
extensive outbreak of polio in Nigeria, which resulted following the
suspension of polio immunization campaigns in some northern states of the
country in August 2003. As of March 2004, all states in Nigeria, with the
exception of Kano, had resumed mass polio immunization activities.

The polio case in Botswana underlines the magnitude of the risk posed to
polio-free areas by the ongoing polio outbreaks in west and central Africa,
and is compounded by the growing vulnerability of populations to polio
globally, following the cessation of preventive polio immunization
campaigns in most polio-free countries in 2002/03. Children across Africa
will continue to be at risk of polio from such importations until the
disease is eradicated everywhere.

The Government of Botswana, WHO, UNICEF and partners are currently
preparing an emergency response to the importation, including heightened
disease surveillance throughout the country and a nationwide immunization
campaign to ensure that any transmission of wild poliovirus in Botswana is
stopped rapidly. Neighbouring countries are being notified of the
importation, and urged to further strengthen their surveillance for polio
and routine immunization coverage.

The Global Polio Eradication Initiative is spearheaded by WHO, Rotary
International, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and
UNICEF. The poliovirus is now endemic in only 6 countries, down from over
125 when the Global Polio Eradication Initiative was launched in 1988. The
6 countries with indigenous wild poliovirus are: Nigeria, India, Pakistan,
Niger, Afghanistan, and Egypt.

[This is now the 9th formerly polio-free country to have been re-infected
as a result of ongoing poliovirus transmission in Nigeria. (As mentioned
in the WHO press release above, the other 8 countries are: Benin, Burkina
Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, and
Togo.) According to the WHO Polio website on 23 Feb 2004, a massive
synchronized polio immunization campaign was launched in 10 countries
across west and central Africa (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central
African Republic, Chad, Cote dIvoire, Ghana, Niger, Nigeria and Togo), in
an effort to immunize more than 63 million children.
<http://www.who.int/vaccines-polio/all/news/files/pdf/position_20040303_sia.pdf>

The occurrence of a case in Botswana in southern Africa, without a direct
history of travel to Nigeria or known contact with persons who had recently
traveled to Nigeria, suggests that there is now circulation of the wild
poliovirus in Botswana. In the laboratory finding mentioned in the 1st
newswire above, genetic sequencing matching those viruses in circulation in
Northern Nigeria is significant evidence that the origin of the virus
involved in this case was West Africa. As mentioned above, there have been
polio cases in 8 additional countries in West Africa as a result of the
continued poliovirus transmission in Nigeria, and the case in Botswana
could be associated with contact with individuals from any of these 8
countries in addition to Nigeria.

Looking at a map of Africa, one realizes that many countries lie between
Nigeria and the west African countries and Botswana to the south, including
countries with significant infrastructural challenges as well as political
unrest, such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Angola. One
wonders whether the current virus arrived via air or land. If the latter,
it suggests that there is ongoing poliovirus transmission in a wider
geographic region of Africa. This scenario would prove to be a significant
obstacle to the goal of polio eradication. We await further information on
the result of increased surveillance for polio-like illness (acute flaccid
paralysis) in the countries in the region. The barriers to vaccination
activities in Northern Nigeria seem inexcusable and might well be defined
as a form of bio-terrorism in today's environment. - Mod.MPP]
