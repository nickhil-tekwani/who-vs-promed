Following an initial report by the clinicians of the Kantha Bopha hospital that, despite their best efforts, dozens of deaths had occurred in young children presenting with encephalitis associated with pulmonary edema, human enterovirus serotype 71 (EV71) was identified by the Institut Pasteur in Cambodia. The virus was then also detected in mild or severe hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) cases in many hospitals throughout the country through a surveillance system established by the Ministry of Health, WHO, National Institute of Public Health with the support of many partners like US CDC.

We analyzed 3 isolates randomly selected from patients originating from different Cambodian provinces over a 4-week period. Approximately 841 base pairs of the VP1 gene (positions 2268 to 3109) were sequenced and aligned with sequences of strains isolated in Viet Nam in 2011 and 2012 (data kindly provided by Thanh Tran Tan, Jeremy Farrar, Rogier van Doorn; Oxford University Clinical Research Unit -- Ho Chi Minh City -- Viet Nam/Wellcome Trust Major Overseas Programme), in Shanghai in 2011 and 2012 (data provided by Ralf Altmeyer and Ke Lan; Institut Pasteur Shanghai), and with various sequences available in GenBank and originating from other Asian countries (e.g., Singapore, Malaysia).

The phylogenetic analysis shows that the EV71 sequences from Cambodia cluster with those of the EV71 strains genotype C4 isolated in Viet Nam in 2011 and 2012 (homology at the nucleotide level: 98.78-99.39 percent; homology at the amino acid level: 98.78-100 percent) [and] are closely related to the sequences of the C4 genotype viruses detected in 2010-2012 in China (homology at the nucleotide level: 98.17-99.39 percent; homology at the amino acid level: 98.17-100 percent).

Further genomic characterization is still ongoing. These preliminary data, however, suggest that strains in Cambodia are part of the ongoing outbreak of EV71 that is proceeding across Asia and involves strains similar to those observed in other countries in the region. This is important, as Cambodia does not have enough data yet to evaluate the true case fatality rate of the current EV71 outbreak. This denominator of the total number of non-severe cases will be ascertained by targeted seroprevalence studies that are currently being developed.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Philip Buchy for providing the information that human enterovirus 71, genotype C4 is the principal etiologic agent responsible for the outbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease currently affecting children in Cambodia and Thailand, and other countries in Southeast Asia.

According to Chan YF, Sam IC, AbuBakar S., in "Phylogenetic designation of enterovirus 71 genotypes and subgenotypes using complete genome sequences," published in Infect Genet Evol. 2010 Apr;10(3):404-12. Epub 2009 May 22. (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134809001257):
"Human enterovirus 71 (EV-71) is genotyped for molecular epidemiological investigation mainly using the 2 structural genes, VP1 and VP4.

Based on these, EV-71 can be divided into 3 genotypes, A, B and C, and within the genotypes B and C, there are further subgenotypes, B1-B5 and C1-C5. Classification using these genes is useful but gives incomplete phylogenetic information. In the present study, the phylogenetic relationships amongst all the known EV-71 and human enterovirus A (HEV-A) isolates with complete genome sequences were examined.

A different tree topology involving EV-71 isolates of subgenotypes C4 and B5 was obtained in comparison to that drawn using VP1. The nucleotide sequence divergence of the C4 isolates was 18.11 percent (17-20 percent) when compared to other isolates of subgenotype C. However, this positions the C4 isolates within the cut-off divergence value of 17-22 percent used to designate the virus genotypes.

Hence, it is proposed here that C4 should be designated as a new genotype D. In addition, the subgenotype B5 isolates had an average nucleotide divergence of only 6.14 percent (4-8 percent) when compared to other subgenotype B4 isolates. This places the B5 isolates within the subgenotype B4. It is proposed here that the B5 isolates be re-designated as B4. With the newly proposed genotype D and inclusion of subgenotype B5 within B4, the average nucleotide divergence between genotypes was 18.99 percent (17-22 percent). Inter- and intra-subgenotype average divergences were 12.02 percent (10-14 percent) and 3.92 percent (1-10 percent), respectively. A phylogenetic tree built using the full genome sequences is robust as it takes into consideration changes in the sequences of both the structural and non-structural genes. Similar nucleotide similarities, however, were obtained if only VP1 and 3D RNA polymerase genes were used. Furthermore, addition of 3D RNA polymerase sequences will also show recombination events. Hence, in the absence of full genome sequences, it is proposed here that a combination of VP1 and 3D RNA polymerase gene sequences be used for initial genotyping of EV-71 isolates."

Further information on the progress of analysis of clinical isolates of enterovirus 71, genotype C4 particularly in relation to severity of disease is awaited.
