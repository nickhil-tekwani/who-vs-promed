Nationwide rubella epidemic -- Japan, 2013
------------------------------------------
Rubella usually is a mild, febrile rash illness in children and adults; however, infection early in pregnancy, particularly during the 1st 16 weeks, can result in miscarriage, stillbirth, or an infant born with birth defects (that is, congenital rubella syndrome [CRS]). As of 2013, goals to eliminate rubella have been established in 2 World Health Organization regions (the Region of the Americas by 2010 and the European Region by 2015), and targets for accelerated rubella control and CRS prevention have been established by the Western Pacific Region (WPR). In 1976, Japan introduced single-antigen rubella vaccine in its national immunization program, targeting girls in junior high school. In 1989, a measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine was introduced, targeting children aged 12-72 months. However, adult males remain susceptible to rubella. From [1 Jan 2013] to [1 May 2013], a total of 5442 rubella cases were reported through the rubella surveillance system in Japan, with the majority (77 per cent) of cases occurring among adult males. A total of 10 infants with CRS were reported from October 2012 to [1 May 2013]. Countries and regions establishing a goal of accelerated control or elimination of rubella should review their previous and current immunization policies and strategies to identify and vaccinate susceptible persons and to ensure high population immunity in all cohorts, both male and female.

From 1999 to 2007, rubella surveillance in Japan consisted of aggregate case reporting to the pediatric sentinel surveillance system. Cases were reported from a representative sample of about 3000 pediatric inpatient and outpatient medical facilities. In January 2008, the sentinel surveillance systems were replaced by nationwide case-based surveillance for rubella, and all physicians were required to report any clinically diagnosed or laboratory-confirmed rubella case to local health officials. In April 1999, nationwide, case-based surveillance for CRS had been established.

Until the early 2000s, rubella was endemic in Japan, with periodic epidemics approximately every 5 years and seasonal increases in the spring and summer. The number of reported rubella cases remained at record low levels until 2010, and in 2011, a few outbreaks were reported in the workplace among adult males. In 2012, the number of rubella cases sharply increased to 2392, with the rise in cases continuing into 2013. From [1 Jan 2013] to [1 May 2013], a total of 5442 rubella cases were reported. Of these cases, 3936 (72.3 per cent) were laboratory confirmed. Geographically, over 60 per cent of rubella cases were reported from the Kanto [region] in the eastern part of Japan, comprised of Tokyo and its surrounding prefectures. In recent weeks, the epidemic has expanded from Kanto to other parts of Japan, including Osaka, Hyogo, Aichi, Fukuoka, and Kagoshima. Of the 5442 cases, males accounted for 4213 cases (77.4 per cent), of which 3878 cases (92.0 per cent) were in persons over 20 years old. Of the 4834 cases in persons over 20 years old, 1727 (36 per cent) were in persons aged 30-39 years and 1535 (32 per cent) in persons aged 20-29 years. Among rubella cases, vaccination history was unknown in a majority of cases (3538 [65 per cent]). For the 1904 reported rubella cases with known vaccination status, 1566 (82 per cent) occurred in persons who had not received rubella vaccine. Virus genotypes were determined for 150 cases in 2012; of these, 123 (82.0 per cent) and 26 (17.0 per cent) were genotypes 2B and 1E, respectively.

From 2008 to 2011, 3 cases of CRS were reported nationwide. Since October 2012, 10 CRS cases have been reported from Hyogo (2), Aichi (2), Osaka (2), Tokyo (1), Kagawa (1), Saitama (1), and Kanagawa (1). Of the mothers of infants with CRS, 6 had not received rubella vaccine, and 4 had unknown vaccination history.

Population immunity is measured by administrative coverage and seroprevalence surveys. In 2011, administrative measles-rubella (MR) vaccine coverage was 95.3 per cent at age one year, 92.8 per cent at age 5-6 years, 88.1 per cent at age 12-13 years, and 81.4 per cent at age 17-18 years. Population immunity for 8 vaccine-preventable diseases is measured by the National Epidemiological Surveillance of Vaccine Preventable Diseases, an annual, national seroepidemiologic survey conducted among a representative sample of the Japanese population. In 2012, 14 prefectures in Japan joined this serologic survey by measuring rubella hemagglutination inhibition antibody levels in 5094 healthy persons. Among adults aged 30-50 years, seropositivity for rubella antibody (1:8) was 73-86 per cent among males and 97-98 per cent among females.

In response to the current outbreak, Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare provided guidance to health care authorities. The guidance is to provide information on rubella disease and CRS for pregnant women and their households and encouraged vaccination of the family members of pregnant women (because rubella vaccine is contraindicated in pregnant women) and vaccination for women who plan to get pregnant. The local governments in approximately 100 cities, including several districts in the Tokyo metropolitan area that had high numbers of reported rubella cases, have provided partial funding to help with the cost of MR vaccine or a single rubella vaccine for women planning pregnancy and for men who are living with a pregnant woman. In addition, mass media agencies in Japan have provided information about the rubella epidemic, including rubella disease and CRS, which has helped increase awareness about the importance of rubella vaccination.

MMWR editorial note
-------------------
The primary purpose of rubella vaccination is to prevent congenital rubella virus infection, including CRS. In WPR, the Immunization Technical Advisory Group endorsed a regional accelerated rubella control and CRS prevention goal to decrease rubella incidence to less than 10 cases per million population and CRS incidence to less than 10 cases per million live births each year by 2015. In 2012, Japan reported 18.7 rubella cases per million population, a rate higher than the WPR annual incidence target. As of May 2013 (4 months into the year), the number of reported rubella cases is already double the total number of cases in 2012.

In 1976, Japan established a goal to prevent CRS and introduced single-antigen rubella vaccine in its national immunization program, targeting girls in junior high school. In 1989, an MMR vaccine was introduced, targeting children aged 12-72 months, but this combination vaccine was withdrawn in 1993 after reports of aseptic meningitis related to the mumps component. In 1995, vaccination policy was changed to make all vaccines strongly recommended but not mandatory, and in 2006, the MR combined vaccine was introduced, with a 2-dose schedule administered at 1-2 years and 5-7 years. After a large measles outbreak in 2007 and 2008, a catch-up MR vaccination program was implemented, targeting 2 age cohorts (those aged 12 years and those aged 17 years) each year from 2008 to 2013 to ensure high population immunity among persons aged 12-22 years in 2013.

In the current outbreak, males aged 20-39 years, who were not included in the initial rubella vaccination program, accounted for 68 per cent of the reported cases. However, with the introduction of 2 doses of MR vaccine into the national vaccination schedule in 2006 for both boys and girls and the successful catch-up vaccination program, children who are currently under 15 years old account for only 5.6 per cent of the cases. In other countries (for example, Brazil, Chile, and Argentina), where only adolescent or adult females have been targeted through national immunization programs or as part of mass vaccination campaigns, similar large outbreaks have occurred among adolescent and adult males, with a concomitant increase in CRS cases. These types of outbreaks emphasize that national immunization programs should ensure high levels of immunity in all cohorts born since the introduction of rubella vaccine (both males and females) either through the routine program or high-quality mass campaigns that are sufficient to interrupt rubella virus transmission and prevent CRS cases. In addition, programs should implement high-quality, case-based rubella and CRS surveillance and respond promptly and rapidly to outbreaks.

The effects of this outbreak have been wide-ranging, both within Japan and internationally. In the Region of the Americas, where endemic rubella virus transmission has been interrupted, importations have occurred in the United States and Canada in 2013. The international spread of rubella virus from Japan provides a reminder that countries in regions that have eliminated rubella need to maintain high levels of vaccination coverage and high-quality surveillance to limit the spread and detect imported rubella virus.

[Congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) is caused by fetal infection with rubella virus from the mother, and is characterized by birth defects such as hearing impairment, heart defects, and cataracts. Several countries that initially vaccinated only adolescent or adult women, then later introduced rubella vaccine into their routine programs or conducted mass campaigns in adolescent and adult females, have experienced large rubella outbreaks among adolescent and young adult males, with a concomitant increase in infants with CRS. In 2012, the number of rubella cases in Japan sharply increased to 2392, with the rise in cases continuing into 2013 and resulting in a cumulative total of 5442 cases from 1 Jan 2013 to 1 May 2013. Of these cases, 23 per cent were in females. Since October 2012, 10 congenital rubella syndrome cases have been reported. Countries using rubella vaccine should aim to prevent rubella outbreaks by ensuring high rubella immunity across all age groups (both males and females). In cohorts born since the introduction of rubella vaccine, this immunity is achieved primarily through uniformly high vaccination coverage. - Mod.CP
