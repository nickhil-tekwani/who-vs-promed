A Missouri resident has been infected by a microscopic organism that causes a rare, life-threatening brain infection after swimming in late June [2022] at Lake of Three Fires State Park in Southwest Iowa.

The Iowa Department of Health and Human Services has closed the Taylor County lake to swimming as officials test for _Naegleria fowleri_, a single-cell, parasitic amoeba that can cause primary amebic meningoencephalitis.

The brain infection is rare -- only 154 cases in the United States since 1962 -- but it's nearly always fatal.

_Naegleria fowleri_ can be present in warm, freshwater lakes and ponds. Infection occurs when water is forced up a swimmer's nose and the organism travels to the brain, where it destroys brain tissue, the Health Department reported. The infection can't be spread from one person to another and can't be contracted by swallowing contaminated water.

"It's the worst parasite in the world that we know of because it causes such devastating pathology," said Christopher Rice, a research scientist in the Center for Drug Discovery at the University of Georgia, who studies _Naegleria fowleri_.

The brain infection is difficult to diagnose because it requires a sample of cerebral spinal fluid, Rice said. He believes some deaths attributed to other diseases causing meningitis may actually be caused by this parasite.

"_Naegleria fowleri_ can kill you within 3 days, so the longer it takes for diagnoses it can be time ticking away," he said. There are some drugs available to treat the infection, but they haven't proved very effective in the lab, Rice said.

Lisa Cox, the spokeswoman for the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, said on Friday [8 Jul 2022] that the infected person is in intensive care at a Missouri hospital. Officials have not disclosed the person's age or gender.

_Naegleria fowleri_ most often infects children or young adults who are swimming and jumping into lakes and ponds, Rice said. Other cases, many in Pakistan, involved middle-aged men who use neti pots to rinse out nasal passages.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention informed Missouri officials on Wednesday [6 Jul 2022] about the exposure, Cox said. Officials believe the person swam at Lake of Three Fires sometime in the last 2 weeks of June [2022].

"It's strongly believed by public health experts that the lake is a likely source, but we are not limiting the investigation to that source and it's not confirmed," Cox wrote in an email. "Additional public water sources in Missouri are being tested as well."

Lake of Three Fires, about 25 mi [approx. 40 km] east of Clarinda, is an 85-acre lake popular with boaters and anglers, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources reports. The state park was dedicated in 1935 and is named after a group of Native Americans from the Potawatomi tribe, known as the "Fire Nation," who once inhabited the area. The lake has frequently been closed to swimming in past summers because of harmful algae that create toxic microcystins that can sicken swimmers. Algae are fed by phosphorus that washes from farm fields into streams and lakes.

The Iowa DNR issued swim warnings at Lake of Three Fires for 3 weekends in 2021, with 2 for _E.coli_ bacteria and one for _E.coli_ and microcystins. In 2020, the state advised against swimming there 3 weeks because of microcystins.

Algae and bacteria provide a welcoming environment for _Naegleria fowleri_, which are common in soil and water, Rice said. "We do know the algal blooms and other bacterium do allow the parasite to survive, because that's generally what it feeds on," he said.

The CDC is providing the Iowa DNR with equipment to test water at the Lake of Three Fires next week, state Health Department spokeswoman Sarah Ekstrand said on Friday [8 Jul 2022]. "The CDC will be doing the analysis. The DNR, Iowa HHS and CDC are working closely to coordinate testing and will provide additional updates as test results become available," Ekstrand said. "At this time, there are no plans to test other lakes."

It is unlikely _Naegleria fowleri_ would be carried from one water body to another, Rice said, although there is some research about whether it could be spread by other animals, such as birds.

While the brain infection is rare, people who experience the following symptoms after swimming in any warm body of water should contact their doctor immediately, the state advises:
Severe headache
Fever
Nausea
Vomiting
Stiff neck
Seizures
Altered mental status
Hallucinations

[This unfortunate case of primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) occurred in a Missouri resident who was presumably exposed by swimming in the Lake of Three Fingers, which is situated in southern Iowa not far from the Missouri border. The age and gender of the patient have not been disclosed, but historically most cases of PAM in the USA have occurred in young males exposed to warm recreational waters (predominantly in lakes, ponds, and reservoirs) during the summer months. The parasite is thought to enter directly into the CNS through olfactory neuron foramina in the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone at the base of the skull. The invasive _Naegleria_ trophozoites then consume neurons and astrocytes, with rapid and devastating consequences for the brain. Other CNS amebic infections include _Acanthamoeba_ and _Balamuthia mandrillaris_.

_N. fowleri_ is a thermophilic organism, and the seasonal occurrence of PAM may be related not only to ambient water temperature per se, but also to increased food supply during the warmer months. In that regard, it is noteworthy that the article mentions that prior algal blooms have forced the closure of the Lake of Three Fingers in past summers. With climate change, we may expect to see more cases of PAM occurring farther north than in the past (see https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5100007/pdf/nihms-824416.pdf).

The article states that the affected patient is hospitalized in an ICU. The case fatality rate is >95%, and the few reported survivors of PAM in the USA were diagnosed less than 2 days following exposure and were treated with the recommended complex cocktail of drugs that include the mainstay drug of amphotericin B and the newer antiprotozoal agent miltefosine (for details, see https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/naegleria/treatment.html). - Mod.LXL
