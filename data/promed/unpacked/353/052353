One animal in one cattle herd on one western Saskatchewan farm is the lone
confirmed case of anthrax poisoning so far this spring and summer [2009] in
western Canada's livestock herds. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency said
Friday [26 Jun 2009] that this case was reported 3 Jun 2009 on a farm in
the RM of King George, in the Rosetown/Outlook area.

The spores that cause anthrax poisoning are known to exist in soil across
the Canadian Prairies, and findings of anthrax are "common", CFIA said.

Despite the low incidence so far this grazing season, CFIA still advised
producers to consult with their veterinarians about making anthrax
vaccinations part of a regular herd-health maintenance program should they
reside in a known anthrax-infected area.

[It is still early days, so there will be more outbreaks in Saskatchewan
before the summer is over. However, the Canadians have been working very
hard to persuade their ranchers in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba to
get their cattle vaccinated. Because of the recent epidemics across the
prairies, there are many contaminated sites scattered here and there just
waiting to be found by a susceptible grazing cow.
