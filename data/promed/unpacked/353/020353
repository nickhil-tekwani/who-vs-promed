Yesterday [22 May 2010] the Guangdong Provincial Health Department
reported that 16 people in Guangzhou and 9 people in Zhuhai developed
suspected food poisoning [specifically paralytic shellfish poisoning
- Mod.LL] after eating scallops at home.

According to the notification, the Provincial Health Department
received reports from Guangzhou and Zhuhai municipal health bureaus
in recent days. By 21 May 2010, the 2 cities had a total of 25 people
who developed suspected poisoning after eating fresh scallops at
home. The patients' clinical symptoms were relatively mild, and the
main symptoms were blurry vision, dizziness, and weakness. In some
cases there was vomiting and diarrhea. All patients recovered after treatment.

The Provincial Health Department reminds all residents to be cautious
and reduce consumption of shellfish, and when preparing [scallops] be
sure to cleanly remove the internal organs to prevent food poisoning
[and only eat the adductor muscle. - Mod.LL]
