Acute respiratory syndrome - Democratic Republic of the Congo
-------------------------------------------------------------
As of Fri 22 Nov 2002, over 4000 cases of acute respiratory illness,
including about 500 deaths, have been reported since October 2002 from
Bosobolo (Equateur Province), Democratic Republic of the Congo.
The clinical features of the illness include rhinorrhea, headache,
arthralgia, and respiratory insufficiency. Laboratory confirmation of the
cause of this outbreak is pending.
Access to and communications with the affected area is difficult.
Currently, Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF-France), Epicentre, and WHO are
supporting the Ministry of Health in investigating this outbreak and
providing medical services.

[Many respiratory pathogens can cause outbreaks of this type. Recent
experience in Madagascar (referenced below) indicates that influenza virus
is the prime suspect in the absence of other information, which is awaited
with interest. - Mod.CP]
