The observation that an increasing number of persons are surviving
hantavirus pulmonary syndrome may be due to: a) initial case-fatality rates
were "inflated" due to retrospectively recognized patients who had died of
HPS b) preferential recognition of the more severe manifestations of a new
syndrome in the time period after it is first described c) increasing
awareness by clinicians requesting hantavirus testing on patients earlier
in the course of disease as opposed to post-mortem thus increasing the
potential for survivors among those tested d) cases being treated at
hospitals more adept at intensive cardiopulmonary support or possibly
published recommendations on management of this syndrome actually having a
beneficial effect on outcome(?).
[Very nice list. You might add attenuation of the virus. Oh, to be able to
gauge the relative effect of each factor on increased survival.- Mod. pc]
I agree that ribavirin is probably not a big factor here.
