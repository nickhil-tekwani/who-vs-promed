There is currently a statewide outbreak of syphilis in Arizona, a bacterial infection that is usually spread by sexual contact. Medical providers are seeing the largest increase of syphilis cases in women and newborns.

A pregnant woman can pass syphilis to her unborn child, which is called congenital syphilis. Congenital syphilis can lead to problems with the skin, eyes and brain, stillbirth or infant death. Up to 40 percent of untreated syphilitic pregnancies result in stillbirth or newborn death.

In a follow-up on a report in early October [2018], Arizona state health officials report the number of congenital syphilis cases, or syphilis cases in babies, has risen to 45 as of today [25 Nov 2018]. Of this total, 8 baby deaths have been reported.

Since January 2015, the monthly average of syphilis cases in women has increased by more than 250 percent, with 637 cases reported year-to-date.

The Arizona Department of Health recommends pregnant women discuss their risk with a health care provider and get tested. Getting timely testing and treatment can reduce negative health outcomes for mother and baby.

[Congenital syphilis occurs when a fetus is exposed in utero to a mother with untreated early syphilis. Up to 40 per cent of babies born to women with untreated early syphilis may be stillborn or die from the infection as a newborn (https://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/stdfact-congenital-syphilis.htm). Some babies are asymptomatic at birth but, if untreated, may show developmental delay and damage to their bones, teeth, eyes, ears, and brain either in the 1st few weeks after birth or years later.

During 2013-2016, the rate of primary and secondary syphilis increased nationally in the U.S. both among men and women. During 2015-2016, the rate increased 14.7 per cent among men and 35.7 per cent among women. These increases among women are of particular concern because congenital syphilis cases tend to increase as the rates of primary and secondary syphilis among women increase (https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats16/figures/44.htm).

After decreasing to 8.4 cases of reported congenital syphilis per 100 000 live births in 2012, the rate increased nationally in the U.S. each year to 12.3 in 2015, with 492 cases of congenital syphilis, and to 15.7 in 2016, with 628 cases of congenital syphilis, including 41 syphilitic stillbirths (https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats16/tables/1.htm#modalIdString_CDCTable_0). Rates of congenial syphilis this high hadn't been seen since 1998. National data for 2017 are not yet available.

Arizona reported 13-15 cases of congenital syphilis per year in the years 2012-2016, with rates of 15.0 to 17.3 per 100 000 live births (https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats16/tables/41.htm#modalIdString_CDCTable_0).

During 2012-2016, the increase in reported congenital syphilis cases in the US was primarily attributable to an increase in the western region (Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming); during this period, the congenital syphilis rate increased 365.5 per cent in the West, 100 per cent in the Northeast, 29.9 per cent in the South, and 23.5 per cent in the Midwest (https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats16/Syphilis.htm). - Mod.ML
