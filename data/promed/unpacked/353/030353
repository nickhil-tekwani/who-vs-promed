US flu activity continues to rise sharply
-----------------------------------------
Influenza activity continued its sharp rise through the last week of 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said today [4 Jan 2012]. "Reports of influenza-like-illness (ILI) are nearing what have been peak levels during moderately severe seasons," said Joe Bresee, MD, chief of epidemiology and prevention in the CDC's flu division, in a CDC statement [http://www.cdc.gov/flu/spotlights/flu-activity-picks-up.htm] today.

The percentage of outpatient visits for ILI reported to the CDC's ILI network reached 5.6 percent for the week ending 29 Dec 2012 (week 52), up from 4.2 percent the week before and well above the national baseline of 2.2 percent. In the last moderately severe flu season, 2007-08, ILI activity peaked at 6.4 percent, in late February. By comparison, that marker reached 8.0 percent during the peak of the 2009 pandemic in October, according to CDC data.

As outlined in the agency's weekly FluView update, 31.6 percent of 9363 lab-tested respiratory specimens during week 52 were positive for flu, up from 29.6 percent the week before. That number approached 60 percent in midwestern states [see http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/].

41 states reported geographically widespread flu activity, 7 had regional activity, and one reported sporadic activity. During the previous week, 31 states reported widespread flu activity. The H3N2 strain -- typically associated with more-severe seasons -- continued to dominate, constituting 1209 (98 percent) of 1234 influenza A viruses that were subtyped, with the other 2 percent being pandemic 2009 H1N1. All told, 79 percent of flu viruses tested were type A and 21 percent type B. The circulating strains continue to be well matched to the strains in the flu vaccine, and no resistance to antiviral drugs has been detected, the CDC said. 2 new pediatric flu deaths were reported, bringing the season total to 18.

"While we can't say for certain how severe this season will be, we can say that a lot of people are getting sick with influenza and we are getting reports of severe illness and hospitalizations," Bresee said, adding, "Anyone who has not already been vaccinated should do so now."

Summary - week 52/2012 [24-30 Dec 2012]
---------------------------------------
Influenza-like illness (ILI) and acute respiratory infection (ARI) consultation rates continue to rise, following a west-to-east progression across the WHO European Region. For the 2nd week, reporting of influenza surveillance data was incomplete, due to the holiday period. Countries mainly in the western part of the Region reported co-circulation of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and type B viruses. The proportion of A(H1N1)pdm09 is considerably higher in comparison with the same time period last season. The number of reported of hospitalizations due to severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) remains low, with no cases being associated with influenza detection.

In week 52/2012, the reported number of specimens testing positive for influenza, along with the number of samples tested, was relatively low, due to suboptimal reporting by countries in the eastern part of the Region during the holiday period. Overall, a total of 844 specimens tested positive for influenza in week 52/2012: 593 were type A and 251 were type B. Of the influenza A viruses, 194 were subtyped: 55 as A(H3N2) and 139 as A(H1N1)pdm09.

Since week 40/2012 [1-7 Oct 2012], influenza A and influenza B viruses had been detected in comparable proportions. The prevalence of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 increased in week 52, however; 4068 influenza viruses from sentinel and non-sentinel sources have been typed: 2454 (60 percent) were influenza A and 1614 (40 percent) influenza B. Of the influenza A viruses 1293 were subtyped: 655 (51 percent) as A(H3N2) and 638 (49 percent) as A(H1N1)pdm09.

The proportion of A(H1N1)pdm09 cases is significantly higher than in the same period last season, when these cases, from sentinel and non-sentinel sources, represented less than 5 percent of total detections.

In week 52/2012, Denmark, the Czech Republic, Germany, and Turkey reported influenza A as the dominant virus type, while Ireland, Luxembourg, and Spain reported influenza B as dominant. France and Switzerland reported influenza A and B as co-dominant. It is still too early to assess which influenza viruses will dominate this season as the number of detections remains relatively low.

Virus strain characterizations
------------------------------
Since week 40/2012, 81 influenza viruses characterized antigenically by 7 countries (Denmark, the United Kingdom (England), Germany, Latvia, Portugal, Romania, Switzerland) corresponded with the viruses recommended by WHO for inclusion in the current northern hemisphere seasonal influenza vaccine. 8 countries (Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden) have characterized 91 influenza viruses genetically.

Monitoring of susceptibility to antiviral drugs
-----------------------------------------------
Since week 40/2012, 7 countries (Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom) have screened 81 viruses for susceptibility to the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir. The 37 influenza A(H3N2) viruses, 28 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, and 16 influenza B viruses showed susceptibility to both drugs. The 14 influenza A(H3N2) and 5 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses screened for susceptibility to adamantanes were found to be resistant.

Outpatient surveillance for influenza-like illness (ILI) and/or acute respiratory infection (ARI)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Consultation rates for ILI and ARI remain at low levels throughout most countries in the WHO European Region, but are increasing in some western countries (France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Norway). In addition, a growing number of countries (Belgium, Denmark, Italy, France, the Netherlands, Norway, and the United Kingdom (England)) reported regional or widespread circulation of influenza in week 52. Although some countries in eastern Europe and central Asia reported increasing trends in ILI or ARI, influenza activity remains low in this part of the Region.

ProMED-mail is supplementing the above with the following additional information describing the current situation in Norway, translated from a Norwegian newspaper by Dr Peter Andras Csango.

"At the beginning of the entrance to the new influenza season, the laboratory reports are at a level that indicates low influenza activity. Last week [week ending 30 Dec 2012], of the 590 samples analyzed 4 influenza A viruses and 3 influenza B viruses were detected. 2 of last week's influenza A viruses were A(H1N1)pdm09, the other 2 have not been subtyped yet. Earlier this fall [2012], most surveyed A virus was A(H3N2). The hitherto studied 3 influenza B viruses belong to the Yamagata [lineage], as do most B viruses in recent months. There were fewer influenza A cases than in the previous week, when most came from hospitalized patients at a single hospital. Otherwise the incidence appears to be on the same level as in the previous week."

Overall there are differences currently in the frequencies of the A and B strains circulating in Europe and North America, but the outbreak strains are still all well-matched with the current northern hemisphere vaccine. It will be interesting to observe to what extent this close-matching will have on the severity and course of the developing global epidemic, in comparison with previous years. - Mod.CP]
