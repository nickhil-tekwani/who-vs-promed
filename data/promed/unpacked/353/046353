The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today [23 Mar 2015] received notification from the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) of a human case of avian influenza A(H5N1) affecting a man aged 34 in Yunnan.

According to the information provided by NHFPC, the patient lives in Kunming and had been exposed to poultry. He developed a fever on 13 Mar 2015 and attended a local hospital on 15 Mar 2015. He is currently hospitalised for treatment and is in a serious condition. His specimen, which was tested by the relevant authority, was positive for avian influenza A(H5N1).

"Locally, we will remain vigilant and work closely with the World Health Organization and relevant health authorities to monitor the latest developments," a spokesman for the DH said.

Health surveillance measures have been implemented at all boundary control points. Thermal imaging systems are in place for body temperature checks on inbound travellers and the DH also conducts temperature checks by handheld devices. Suspected cases will be immediately referred to public hospitals for follow-up. ... -- more

FluTrackers 2015 Global H5N1 Case List (https://flutrackers.com/forum/forum/china-h5n1-h5n8-h5n6-h5n3-h5n2-h10n8-outbreak-tracking/727743-china-yunnan-province-announces-new-h5n1-bird-flu-case-march-23-2015)

Excerpted and edited from Outbreak News Today (http://outbreaknewstoday.com/china-reports-another-human-case-of-h5n1-avian-influenza-25816/): the most recent data on cumulative H5N1 cases from the WHO dated 3 Mar 2015 puts the count at 784 cases and 429 deaths since 2003. However, with recent cases in China and Egypt, the numbers reported are not up to date.

H5N1 is a type of influenza virus that causes a highly infectious, severe respiratory disease in birds called avian influenza (or "bird flu"). Human cases of H5N1 avian influenza occur occasionally, but it is difficult to transmit the infection from person to person. When people do become infected, the mortality rate is about 60 per cent.

Almost all cases of H5N1 infection in people have been associated with close contact with infected live or dead birds, or H5N1-contaminated environments. The virus does not infect humans easily, and spread from person to person appears to be unusual. There is no evidence that the disease can be spread to people through properly prepared and thoroughly cooked food.
