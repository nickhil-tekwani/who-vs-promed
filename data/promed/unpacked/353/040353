Officials at the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) have confirmed a horse at a private facility in Hillsborough County with West Nile virus (WNV). The affected 7 year old miniature horse mare experienced onset of clinical signs on 1 Nov 2020. Signs included depression, incoordination, listlessness, and hind-limb weakness. This case marks the state's 14th confirmed case of WNV in 2020.

WNV transmission occurs when infected mosquitoes feed on animals, as well as humans, after having fed on infected birds.

Clinical signs of WNV in horses include:
- mild anorexia and depression;
- fine and coarse muscle and skin fasciculation (twitching);
- hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound);
- changes in mentation (mentality), when horses look like they're daydreaming or "just not with it";
- occasional drowsiness;
- propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control);
- spinal signs, including asymmetrical weakness; and
- asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia.

West Nile virus has no cure; however, some horses can recover with supportive care. Equine mortality rates can reach 30%-40%. The American Association of Equine Practitioners includes WNV as one of the core diseases all horses should be vaccinated against at least annually.

Seek the advice of a qualified veterinarian before proceeding with any diagnosis, treatment, or therapy.

["West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquitoborne virus 1st detected in the USA in the New York City area in 1999. Since 1999, the virus has spread throughout the USA and Canada, infecting birds, humans, horses, and other animals. The virus is maintained in the wild bird population and is spread between birds by mosquitos. Birds are considered the natural reservoir for WNV since high levels of virus circulate in their bloodstream. Mosquitos acquire WNV in blood meals from infected birds and pass it on to other birds, animals, and people. Mosquitos that feed on an infected horse or human have not demonstrated the ability to ingest enough of the virus to transmit it to other animals or humans; therefore, horses and humans are considered dead-end hosts.

"Clinical signs: WNV may cause a wide range of clinical illness ranging from mild flu-like signs to encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) that may be fatal to both humans and horses. While horses are susceptible to WNV infection, many infected horses do not develop clinical illness and recover uneventfully.

"Consult a veterinarian if your horse exhibits any of the following clinical signs:
- fever
- incoordination, especially in rear limbs, causing stumbling and falling
- generalized weakness, muscle twitching, seizures or coma
- drooping lips and lip smacking, head drooping, grinding teeth
- hypersensitivity to touch or sound
- recumbency (inability to rise)

"Diagnosis: Any horse displaying abnormal behavior or neurologic signs should be examined by a veterinarian to rule out neurologic diseases, such as WNV, equine herpes virus-1, equine protozoal myeloencephalopathy, eastern/western encephalomyelitis and rabies.

"Blood samples should be collected by a veterinarian and sent for diagnostic testing. The WNV IgM capture ELISA test is a specific test that detects acute WNV infection in animals, is usually positive within 6 days post-infection, and can remain positive for up to 2 months post-infection. A positive WNV IgM capture ELISA test is indicative of recent infection. Unexposed animals vaccinated for WNV will test negative on the WNV IgM capture ELISA test.

"Treatment and prognosis: Currently, there is no specific treatment for WNV. Supportive care includes administration of anti-inflammatory drugs and intravenous fluids. Recumbent WNV-positive horses are at a higher risk of dying or requiring euthanasia. For horses exhibiting clinical signs of WNV, the case fatality rate is approximately 33%; however, many infected horses will fully recover following infection.

"Prevention: Vaccination and mosquito control minimize the risk of WNV infection in horses. Although the number of WNV-infected horses has declined over the last 5 years, WNV remains an important disease in unvaccinated horses. The American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP) recommends incorporation of a WNV vaccine as an annual core vaccine in equine vaccination protocols. Currently, there are 4 US Department of Agriculture (USDA)-licensed WNV vaccines available for horses in the USA. Horse owners should consult with their veterinary practitioner to ensure current WNV vaccination status of their horses.

"Mosquito control: Minimizing horse exposure to mosquitoes during the peak mosquito feeding periods at dawn and dusk decreases the risk of horse exposure to WNV. Application of mosquito repellant can also effectively reduce the number of mosquito bites on horses. Mosquito control efforts to eliminate mosquito breeding sites are also important. Methods to eliminate mosquito breeding sites include:

- draining unnecessary standing water found in wheelbarrows, tires, etc.
- cleaning water containers at least weekly (such as bird baths, plant saucers)
- scheduling pasture irrigation to minimize standing water
- keeping swimming pools optimally chlorinated and draining water from pool covers
- stocking of water tanks with fish that consume mosquito larvae (contact local mosquito control for assistance) or use mosquito dunks available at hardware stores."
