The residents of Zamzam camp for the displaced near El Fasher, capital of North Darfur [Sudan], complain about the spread of a 'new disease', especially among children.

An activist told Radio Dabanga from the camp that since last week [week of 2 Nov 2015] children began to complain of a high fever at night and an itchy skin during the day.

"The majority of the infected children are under 15-years-old. Many of them are coughing too." He attributed the disease to "the difference of temperatures these days. It is very hot during the day, and at night the temperature drops quickly."

The activist appealed to the federal and the state Ministries of Health to speed up the provision of medicines to the camp. Hosting more than 150 000 displaced, Zamzam camp is one of the largest camps in Darfur.

[Outbreaks of undiagnosed febrile illnesses have been reported repeatedly in refugee camps in the Darfur region of Sudan in recent years (see also's below). ProMED-mail recently reported that children living in refugee camps in North Darfur have died from an unidentified disease with body swelling, a high fever, diarrhea, vomiting, and joint pain that has spread among the population beginning 2 months ago, following heavy rainfall (Undiagnosed hemorrhagic fever - Sudan (05): (ND) RFI 20151108.3775050). Now we are told above of a "new disease" outbreak with high fever, itchy rash and cough among children at another refugee camp in North Darfur.

North Darfur, with a population of about 1 583 000 (in 2006), is one of the 5 states (Central, East, North, South and West Darfur) that compose the Darfur region of western Sudan (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Darfur). Al-Fashir, or El Fasher, is the capital of the state. For a map of Sudan showing the location of North Darfur, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:North_Darfur_in_Sudan_(Kafia_Kingi_disputed).svg.

This region has many displaced people living in camps where malnutrition is compounded by extreme overcrowding, shortage of clean water, inadequate latrines, and appalling sanitary conditions. Many families have no shelter other than small, tarpaulin-covered huts that are highly vulnerable to heavy rains and winds. However, the news report above does not state the conditions in which the children in the Zamzam camp are living, but is reported to be bad (http://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/health-situation-north-darfurs-zamzam-camp-deteriorating).

Illnesses in children with high fever and an itchy rash include scarlet fever, chickenpox, and measles, but each has a very distinctive clinical picture. Cough is common in measles. However, the information given in the news release above is insufficient to identify a specific cause of the illness in these children. ProMED-mail would appreciate additional information from knowledgeable sources about these cases. - Mod.ML
