Veterinary Research Institute director Dr Aziz Jamaluddin said all the
states except Sabah and Sarawak were hit by Newcastle disease [NCD
from August last year [2000 to January [2001, adding the sickness
was still prevalent in some states.
"There is no cause for alarm. It is safe to consume chicken," he told
reporters during the regional conference on the latest advances in
diagnosis and control of Newcastle disease in poultry organized by the
institute in Ipoh on Wednesday.
The seminar was opened by Veterinary Services Department deputy
director-general Dr Matta Abdul Rahman. Dr Aziz said the conference
was held to instill awareness among breeders of the need to vaccinate
their poultry.
He said the problem of the disease started in August last year [2000,
but breeders did not inform the Government, the Department, or a
private veterinarian. "They tried to settle it on their own because
they were worried the Government would close down their farms. They
tried to absorb the losses as far as they could until 58 000 chickens
in a farm in Johor died in September last year. They knew then they
could not hold back anymore as the virus could spread to other farms,"
he said.
He said the virus here was different from the one in Australia, which
had mutated and become more aggressive than its original form. "The
difference in Asia is we do not have a critical mutation. The main
problem is vaccination is not carried out efficiently and people have
been compromising on rules. Vaccination is only being carried out at
big farms but not on chicken reared in villages," he added.
Dr Aziz said there was a need to improve building structures to
prevent birds from spreading the virus. He said poultry that had been
attacked by the disease would have symptoms such as respiratory
problems like coughing, and paralysis.
He said all poultry farmers must use the vaccine, adding there were
now about 10 local and foreign vaccines available.

[This outbreak seems unique in its extent, but perhaps not its
virulence. Sabah and Sarawak were perhaps spared because they are not
part of Peninsular Malaysia but are on the island of Borneo,
suggesting there isn't much trade in poultry with the mainland.
However, the breeders should not be lax regarding vaccination.
According to OIE´s Handistatus statistics, 50 outbreaks of NCD which
killed over 120 000 poultry have already been reported from Peninsular
Malaysia through April 2001:

and there were 44 outbreaks in 2000, beginning as early as February:
