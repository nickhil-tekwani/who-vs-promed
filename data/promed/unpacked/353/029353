In Sudan, during surveys of citrus trees conducted in commercial orchards, nurseries and gardens from 2013 to 2014, symptoms of citrus canker were observed on lime trees (_Citrus aurantifolia_) in the state of Al Qadarif (Gadaref). High disease incidence was observed near the city of Al Qadarif. Studies have revealed the presence of a new strain of _Xanthomonas citri_ subsp. _citri_ (EPPO A1 List). It is concluded that further research is needed to characterize strains of _X. citri_ subsp. _citri_ which are present in Eastern Sudan.

[Citrus canker (CC) is caused by the bacteria _Xanthomonas axonopodis_ pathovar _citri_ (synonyms _X. campestris_ pv. _citri_, _X. citri_) or _X. a._ pv. _aurantifolii_, depending on the region. The disease is now present in most citrus growing areas worldwide, except Australia, where an outbreak was successfully eradicated (ProMED-mail post 20090206.0528). CC affects most commercial citrus varieties as well as other members of the family _Rutaceae_. A number of different strains (pathovars) specialise in infecting different hosts to cause bacterial blights in, for example, pomegranate and onion. CC can destroy an entire crop and poses a serious economic threat to citrus industries. Symptoms may include blister-like formations (cankers) on fruit, leaves and branches leading to defoliation and premature fruit drop, as well as twig dieback and general tree decline. Although the taste of the fruit is not affected, it cannot be sold or processed.

The bacterium can be transmitted by mechanical means, water or insects within groves, while long-distance spread occurs mostly by infected plant material. Disease management relies mainly on phytosanitation and use of clean planting and grafting material but may also include bactericidal sprays and use of less susceptible crop varieties. Planting of windbreaks to reduce the number of insects present in groves that can cause wounds on leaf surfaces serving as ports of pathogen entry may also be used to reduce CC incidence.

For Sudan, the original article (see link below) reports the detection of a new lime-specific strain which did not affect other surrounding citrus crops, such as grapefruit or orange. The new strain was found to be related to previously reported lime-specific strains from several other locations in Asia and Africa. This group of strains has been called 'atypical Asiatic form' (Xcc-A*) and differs from other strains by host range and symptomatology.
