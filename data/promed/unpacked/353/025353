An out break of Lassa fever in Lafia, the capital of Nasarawa State, which was confirmed last week, has led to the death of at least one person who shuttled between Nasarawa's 2 biggest health facilities in the frantic search for attention.

The 2nd and 3rd cases involving a couple were confirmed last Friday [25 Jan 2013] after diagnoses conducted on the victims by a team of epidemiologists at the Dalhatu Araf Specialists Hospital (DASH) in Lafia, the Chief Medical Director (CMD), Dr Ahmed Yakubu Ashiki, told the Weekly Trust newspaper, yesterday [25 Jan 2013]. The 3 victims including the deceased, the Weekly Trust learnt, were neighbours in Tudun Gwandara, an over-populated and one of the dirtiest sections of the metropolis.

Dr Ashiki told Weekly Trust that the 2 victims are still on admission at his hospital, and are "doing very well." He expressed hope that with the medication they are receiving, they will be out of the hospital hale and hearty. He confirmed that one other person also contacted the virus, but added that "he is not with us; he was not hospitalized here."

Enquires by the Weekly Trust showed that the 3rd patient, a male, could not secure admission at the DASH because of inadequacy of beds, following which he was advised to proceed to the Federal Medical Centre (FMC), in Keffi, about an hour and 40 minutes drive from Lafia. But sources said this hospital also did not have bed space for the patient, and had to advise him to seek medical attention elsewhere. He died eventually, shuttling between DASH and FMC.

Dr Emmanuel Akabe, State Commissioner for Health who confirmed the outbreak by telephone also informed the Weekly Trust that he has information that the 3rd victim died 3 days ago. He said the patient was first at DASH, but added that there was no bed space to accommodate him, following which the state hospital referred him to the Federal Government-owned health facility, in Keffi. The commissioner said reports available to him showed that the patient died 3 days ago, after he reached DASH, but refused to stay longer while arrangement for his bed was being made.

Jamilu Nagogo, head of the information unit at the FMC, confirmed that the patient was at the hospital for medical attention, just as he confirmed that he had no admission there because of lack of bed space.

[Lassa fever is an acute viral illness that occurs in West Africa. The illness was discovered in 1969 when 2 missionary nurses died in Nigeria, West Africa. The cause of the illness was found to be Lassa virus, named after the town in Nigeria where the 1st cases originated. Lassa fever virus, a member of the virus family _Arenaviridae_, is a single-stranded RNA virus and is zoonotic, or animal-borne. Lassa fever is mild or has no observable symptoms in about 80 percent of people infected with the virus, the remaining 20 percent have a severe multisystem disease. Lassa fever is also associated with occasional epidemics, during which the case-fatality rate can reach 50 percent.

The reservoir, or host, of Lassa virus is a rodent known as the "multimammate rat" of the genus _Mastomys_ (see image at http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fil:Mastomys_coucha.jpg.). It is not certain which species of _Mastomys_ are associated with Lassa; however, at least 2 species carry the virus in Sierra Leone. _Mastomys_ rodents breed very frequently, produce large numbers of offspring, and are numerous in the savannas and forests of West, Central, and East Africa. In addition, _Mastomys_ generally readily colonize human homes. Lassa fever may also spread through person-to-person contact. This type of transmission occurs when a person comes into contact with virus in the blood, tissue, secretions, or excretions of an individual infected with the Lassa virus.

Approximately 15-20 percent of patients hospitalized for Lassa fever die from the illness. The death rates are particularly high for women in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy, and for fetuses, about 95 percent of which die in the uterus of infected pregnant mothers. However, overall only about one percent of infections with Lassa virus result in death. The antiviral ribavirin has been used with success in the treatment of Lassa fever patients. It is not stated in this report the nature of the treatment available in Nigerian hospitals.
