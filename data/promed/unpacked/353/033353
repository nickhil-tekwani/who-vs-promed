Governor Sutiyoso said on Friday [16 Sep 2005] that all poultry farms
in Jakarta should relocate to outside the city in order to stop the
spread of avian influenza in the capital.
"I have told relevant officials to list existing poultry farms ...
The capital must be rid of them," said the governor, when commenting
on a laboratory test that confirmed a 37-year-old woman died of bird
flu at Bintaro International Hospital last week [2nd week September
2005].
Sutiyoso said he had told the City Agriculture, Livestock and
Maritime Agency to find suitable places to relocate the poultry farms.
Citing the result of a test by a laboratory in Hong Kong, Minister of
Health Siti Fadilah Supari announced on Friday [16 Sep 2005] that the
woman who was hospitalized at Bintaro International Hospital had died
of bird flu.

[Minimizing unnecessary mixing between people and domestic poultry,
in order to limit the exposure of humans to zoonotic infections, is
epidemiologically compelling. Since the 1997 Hong Kong avian
influenza H5N1 outbreak, which killed 6 people, the health
authorities there have implemented efficient steps in this direction,
such as enhanced biosecurity measures in poultry farms, biweekly free
days on the wet markets, and limiting slaughter of ducks and geese to
veterinary-controlled abattoirs. This, on top of intensified
surveillance activities and poultry vaccinations. The Indonesian
authorities might commendably consider following the Hong Kong
example.
An official Indonesian report on their epidemiological investigation
following the 1st human cases there was sent to the OIE on 2 Aug
2005; see
