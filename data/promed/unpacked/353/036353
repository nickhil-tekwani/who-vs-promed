News of the response
-------------------
Since the declaration of the epidemic on Wed 1 Aug 2018, several rapid response teams from the Ministry of Health have been sent to the city of Beni and the health zone of Mangina, epicenter of the current epidemic of Ebola.

The case that alerted the provincial health authorities is that of a 65-year-old woman living in Mangina who had been hospitalized at the Mangina Reference Health Center (CSR) a few days before being discharged in mid-July 2018. She died at home a few days later. After her unsecured burial, the family members who cared for her began to show the same symptoms, and 7 of them died.

In reviewing patient records, local health authorities identified earlier sporadic community deaths. Ongoing investigations will determine whether these former community deaths have an epidemiological link between them.

The initial investigations by the surveillance teams reveal that community deaths (probable cases) as well as suspected and confirmed cases have appeared in 7 health zones, including 5 in the North Kivu Province and 2 in the neighboring Ituri Province.

The installation of a mobile laboratory in Beni will facilitate the testing of samples taken from suspected cases in the affected areas. Other mobile laboratories of the Ministry of Health are already operational in several cities in the provinces of North Kivu, Tshopo and Ituri, and they can also be used to test samples taken if necessary.

The 1st Ebola Treatment Centers (ETCs) will be located in Mangina, Beni and Goma. Other ETCs could be installed depending on the evolution of the epidemic.

So far, 879 contacts have been registered by the health authorities.

Vaccination will be an integral part of the response. The Expanded Program on Immunization still has 3220 doses of vaccine in stock in Kinshasa. The cold chain will be deployed in Beni this weekend. Once the optimal temperature of -70 C is reached, the vaccines will be sent to Beni.

The Ministry of Health works closely with the Ministry of Defense and MONUSCO to ensure the protection of health workers and the population.

[Note especially:
- In reviewing patient records, local health authorities identified earlier sporadic community deaths. Ongoing investigations will determine whether these former community deaths have an epidemiological link between them. One has to wonder how long this 10th outbreak has been percolating unnoticed. How much earlier did these sporadic deaths occur? What were the symptoms prior to death, i.e., were they suggestive of Ebola?

- The initial investigations by the surveillance teams reveal that community deaths (probable cases) as well as suspected and confirmed cases have appeared in 7 health zones, including 5 in the North Kivu Province and 2 in the neighboring Ituri Province. It is important to include Ituri Province in the investigations. At least mobile laboratories of the Ministry of Health have been established there.

[2] Response
- Fri 3 Aug 2018. Situation evaluation
WHO [edited]
https://www.afro.who.int/news/ministry-health-who-and-partners-conduct-first-mission-evaluate-ebola-outbreak-mangina-north


The Ministry of Health (MOH) conducted a joint mission on 2 Aug 2018 with the World Health Organization (WHO) and other partners to evaluate the situation in the Mangina health area, where the majority of the cluster of new Ebola cases have been detected.

They met with local authorities, including the Mayor of Beni, Mabalako health zone chief, and other members of the community to discuss the best way to respond to the outbreak. "All the pillars of the response are ready to be implemented to fight this new outbreak in Beni and areas," said Dr Oly Ilunga, DRC Minister of Health. A strong multidisciplinary team will be set up quickly in Beni and in Mangina under MOH leadership and coordination, he added.

The Minister of Health, the Governor of North Kivu and representatives from the Ministry of Health, WHO, UNICEF, MONUSCO, the World Bank, the Deputy Humanitarian coordinator, and dozens of health experts participated in the joint mission.

"WHO is deploying more than 18 experts including epidemiologists, logisticians and experts in Infection Prevention Control, risk communication, social mobilization and community engagement from Goma, Kinshasa and Mbandaka to support the Ministry of Health to stop rapidly the Ebola virus from spreading," said Dr Allarangar Yokouid√©, WHO Representative in the DRC. "Surveillance measures at all entry and exit points between Beni and other major cities are also being strengthened to ensure daily follow up of contacts of 4 confirmed cases to break transmission chains," he emphasized.

Mr. Julien Paluku, North Kivu Governor also launched a message campaign via radio and television to reinforce hygiene and prevention measures in the community. He urged and encouraged safe burials during this outbreak.

[Is Ituri province, where suspected cases have been reported, included in the joint mission? This report only refers to "the Mangina health area, where the majority of the cluster of new Ebola cases have been detected." Perhaps this is as much as they can manage, but all known locations where cases have occurred must be managed. - Mod.LK]

The mobile laboratory is already operational in Beni for the analysis of samples of the Ebola virus disease in the North Kivu province, the ACP learned Fri [3 Aug 2018] from the Ministry of Health.

According to the source, it is proposed that all samples be sent to Beni, while information is gathered to set up another laboratory in Mangina, the epicenter of the 10th epidemic. For entry points, the source indicates that 3 points have been identified at the Uganda border at Kasindi, Kamango and Kiavionongo.

Within the province, there are also several entry points. As part of this response, the Vaccination Commission intends to use the same principles as those used in the previous epidemic. We note that the particularity of this epidemic is the participation of the Ministry of Defense and MONUSCO.

- Sat 4 Aug 2018. Congolese refugees, VOA [edited]
https://www.voanews.com/a/congolese-refugees-risk-infecting-neighboring-countries-with-ebola/4513607.html


U.N. officials warn the deadly Ebola virus could be spread by refugees leaving the Democratic Republic of Congo's North Kivu province. Officials are urging neighboring countries to increase surveillance at border crossings.

More than 100 armed groups are involved in long-standing conflicts in DR Congo's North Kivu province. Ongoing fighting and instability in the region are adding layers of complexity and difficulty to international efforts to combat an Ebola outbreak in the region.

At least 2 decades of conflict have displaced more than one million of the province's 8 million inhabitants. Peter Salama is World Health Organization emergency response chief. He tells VOA an additional threat is posed by refugees. He warns some of those fleeing into neighboring Uganda, Tanzania and Burundi may be taking the infection with them.

"So, not only do you have the problem of tracking that internal displacement, but then you have the potential exportation of infection across borders," Salama said. "And, that is why we are already working with the government of Uganda particularly, but also Rwanda, which shares a border, as well with northern Kivu to be fully prepared for any eventualities across the border."

The U.N. refugee agency is lending its expertise to this situation. It is preparing shelters for at least 1000 vulnerable internally displaced persons and other extremely vulnerable people in the Ebola-affected Beni area. It also is undertaking protection and monitoring activities.

UNHCR [UN Refugee Agency] spokesman Andrej Mahecic says his agency's staff in Uganda, Rwanda and Tanzania are on Ebola alert.

"Specifically, in Uganda, we have a continuous influx from the DRC. Our operation has intensified the awareness-raising among the refugee and host communities. We have also increased the infection control and outbreak preparedness measures," Mahecic said. "And, we also are preparing for entry screening, that could be the temperature checks, for arriving Congolese refugees at the borders."

Mahecic says around 92 000 Congolese refugees have fled to Uganda so far this year [2018]. He says they are continuing to arrive at an average rate of between 100 and 200 a day.

[Increased surveillance in neighboring countries should not be limited to border crossings. If the virus has been circulating longer, undetected, then surveillance should be widespread in the neighboring countries, and perhaps further.

The report suggests that enhanced education to raise awareness among refugees and host communities in Uganda is taking place, as well as increased infection control and preparedness. What is not addressed is enhanced surveillance as mentioned above. This is critical to picking up new cases. - Mod.LK
