Wound botulism in Switzerland
An increased number of suspected cases of wound botulism have been observed
in Switzerland. Five cases have been reported since September 1998, all of
them male injecting drug users. All cases occurred in the north east of
Switzerland. None of the cases has been microbiologically confirmed, but
the specimens submitted for examination were all grossly inadequate. The
degree of clinical suspicion was high in all cases, who needed up to three
weeks of assisted ventilation. So far, no common source of the heroin used
by the cases has been ascertained. Only one case of wound botulism had been
reported in Switzerland previously, in 1997. This case was confirmed by
isolation of _Clostridium botulinum_ (which produced toxin A) from a wound
in an injecting drug user.
A recent review of botulism in the European Union identified only one case
of wound botulism between 1988 and 1998. This case was a 47 year old
carpenter in Italy, where a total of three confirmed cases have been
identified since 1979, all of them associated with injuries sustained in
building and agricultural occupations. Three cases of wound botulism were
identified among injecting drug users in Norway in 1997, but none was
microbiologically confirmed.
Wound botulism is a rare cause of flaccid paralysis due to germination of
_C. botulinum_ spores in wounds and subsequent production of botulinum
toxin. It was first described in association with traumatic injury, but an
association with injecting drug use has been recognised since 1982. In the
United States the condition has been linked to the subcutaneous injection
of black tar heroin, a form of the drug whose use is believed to be
increasing.
