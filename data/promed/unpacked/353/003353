Re: ProMED-mail: Undiagnosed deaths, dolphin - Italy: morbillivirus susp. 20130421.1661903
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Italian stranding Network on Marine Mammals, <www.centrostudicetacei.it/index.php> [in Italian], born from a collaboration between the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Environment in order to coordinate the issue, managed the unusual mortality event occurred along the Tyrrhenian coasts of Italy. The network obtained complete traceability of reports and of sampling as well as uniform diagnostic procedures.

Post mortem investigations were performed by Istituti Zooprofilattici Sperimentali (IIZZSS) [Experimental Zooprophylactic Institutes], namely IZS Lazio Toscana, IZS Mezzogiorno, IZS Sicilia, and IZS Sardegna coordinated by IZS Piemonte Liguria and Valle d'Aosta and supported by the Cetacean Emergency Response Team (CERT = 96 Padova University), applying uniform diagnostic protocols and sharing the results of laboratory analysis. They sampled 58 percent of the stranded animals, according to their conservation conditions. Data obtained allowed to advance 1st hypotheses about possible causes of this unusual mortality.

Most of the animals showed a significantly compromised immune system.

Approximately 30 percent of the tested subjects resulted infected by dolphin morbillivirus (DMV). This percentage could increase to 41 percent in case of confirmation of the 6 pending analyses.

Other pathogens, acting as opportunistic agents, were identified such as _Photobacterium damselae_ subspecies _damselae_ (60 percent), herpesvirus (27.7 percent), _Toxoplasma gondii_ (9.62 percent), and non-specific inflammatory lesions were found in a lot of the tissues sampled.

From available data it is not possible to assert with high level of probability the role of DMV as the primary cause of death in these cetaceans, however its action on the immune system may have played an essential role in this mortality event.

[Special thanks to Cristina Casalone for sending this important piece of information about the episode.

The data fit well with the notion of a vicious cycle, in which deteriorated immunocompetence makes an individual more prone to infections, which impoverish even further the immunocompetence, and so on.

If so, what remains to be unveiled is what originated these vicious cycles. - Mod.PMB]
