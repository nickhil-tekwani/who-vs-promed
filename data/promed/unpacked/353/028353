P4 labs worldwide today

From: "Prof.Dr.M.Dietrich" <dietrich@bni.uni-hamburg.de>

In our institute the department of virology has had a P4 laboratory for
17 years, probably the oldest P4 laboratory of this kind in Europe, at
least on the continent. The group of Prof.Schmitz is working on Lassa
fever, Marburg, Ebola (Sudan and Zaire strains) and other viruses.
The clinical department has a quarantine ward and two isolation bed
systems, which are unique in having both possibilities to treat patients
in strict isolation and also reverse isolation. Therefore the systems
have been in use over the years and the staff is experienced to handle
patients there.
The P4 lab and clinical department with the isolation facilities are under
one roof in the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine. Patients
suspected having hemorrhagic fever are referred to the institute from
the region of northern Germany. These instances are rare.Therefore,
experiences with such patients should be exchanged among centers dealing
with them.

Institute: http://134.100.62.10/bni2/english/index_eng.html
