An Afghan official said on Tuesday that a contagious unknown
respiratory disease killed more than 21 people over the past 2 days
in northeastern Afghanistan. The nature of the disease wasn't
immediately clear.
Ghafour Dawar, the chief of public health in Faizabad, the provincial
capital, said that the victims in the remote Koof district of
Badakhshan province died due to respiratory problems.
"We are concerned about it. It seems the disease is a contagious
one," he said, without elaborating.
Dawar added that doctors could only reach Koof through neighboring
Tajikistan due to the heavy snowfall in the area.
The fatalities bring the total number of people who have lost their
lives of diseases related to the tough winter weather in Afghanistan
over the past month to almost 100.

[The obvious suspect for the etiology of these deaths would be
influenza, considering that this is a relatively isolated population
with reduced access to health care. The newswire states that
physicians can reach the area only via Tajikistan, suggesting that
local Afghani-provided health services are minimal. Under these
conditions, both primary influenza deaths and secondary deaths due to
bacterial pneumonia complicating influenza would be more frequent. We
do not have the necessary information to attempt a
calculation/estimate of either the attack rate or the case fatality
rate. There is also the possibility of a novel viral respiratory
infection, especially considering the report of 21 deaths in a 2-day
span. More information from knowledgeable sources would be
appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
