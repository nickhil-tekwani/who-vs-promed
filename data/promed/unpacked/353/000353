Nodding Disease, Uganda: further data needed
---------------------------------
In several animal species, a clinical presentation of "head nodding" indicates cerebellar involvement. Is there any reason why routine histopathology of the brain, particularly of the cerebellum and related cerebral structures, has not yet been published by PubMed?

Results of such studies should be available within a few days of autopsy. This disease was reported months ago. To date, thousands of people have been afflicted.

Histopathology might quickly and cost-effectively rule in/out an infectious etiology or aquired cerebellar abiotrophy... and also provide a "raison d'etre" for ancillary testing for a possible etiology.

[ProMED-mail thanks Professor Deryck Read for his comment. We entirely agree. We have been asking for autopsy studies and more MR imaging studies including the brain stem.

Published and unpublished MR's have not been consistent, and some described as normal. Results from a few spinal taps describe the spinal fluid as macroscopical normal, but cell counts and protein analysis have not been performed to our knowledge. Also to our knowledge no post mortems have been performed and we agree with Professor Read, that this is urgently needed.

With a prevalence of up to 519 per 100 000 in Pader District, it is urgent to increase efforts to define the etiology in order to be able to control the outbreak prevent new outbreaks. HealthMap location: http://healthmap.org/r/2rUf. - Mod. EP]
