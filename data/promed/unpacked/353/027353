[Some populations of Mandarin ducks (_Aix galericulata_) are year-round residents in South Korea and Japan. Other populations migrate between Russia and eastern Asia. In South Korea, HPAIV was detected from Mandarin duck samples in 2010 (H5N1), 2014 (H5N8) and 2016, suggesting that Mandarin ducks are a major host species for H5 HPAIV and can disseminate the virus throughout South Korea and into other countries. - Mod.PMB
