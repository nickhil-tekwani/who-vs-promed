A type of pesto has been linked to a case of foodborne botulism in Italy. The laboratory confirmed case of botulism occurred in Rome and was reported by Italian officials this week. No details were given about the condition of the patient.

An epidemiological investigation has placed suspicion on a Sicilian broccoli and almond pesto. The label on the jar stated it was packed by La Fattoria Biodinamica in the city of Viterbo but the product did not have a batch number or expiration date. Food has been analyzed by the Italian National Institute of Health (ISS) and found to be negative for botulinum toxins. It is currently believed that the product was given as a gift about 2 months earlier.

Following investigations by local authorities at the farm, it was found that the pesto was made for self-consumption, and beginning in November 2021, the production was suspended. It was not possible to trace the number of jars of Sicilian broccoli and almond pesto produced or how many could have been given away. Italian officials advised people not to consume the implicated pesto, possibly received as a gift, and told them to pay attention to any non-compliant labeling.

Italy has one of the highest rates of foodborne botulism in Europe, according to a study published in the journal Food Control. This work found that out of 2187 samples provided by food businesses for their control protocols, 16 were positive for the presence of botulinum neurotoxin-producing clostridia, including dairy products, fruit, vegetables, sauces, bakery products, meat products, and spices and flavorings.

Botulism is a rare but life-threatening condition caused by toxins produced by _Clostridium botulinum_ bacteria. In foodborne botulism, symptoms generally begin 18 to 36 hours after eating a contaminated food. However, they can start as soon as 6 hours after or up to 10 days later. It can cause symptoms including general weakness, dizziness, double vision, and trouble with speaking or swallowing. It paralyzes respiratory muscles so most patients must be placed on life support. Difficulty in breathing, weakness of other muscles, abdominal distention, and constipation may also occur. People experiencing these problems should seek immediate medical attention.

[Most cases of foodborne botulism occur from home-prepared foods that are stored or canned improperly.

Foodborne botulism usually occurs when the preformed toxin is absorbed through the intestinal tract, and when the botulinum toxin (BT) is exposed to the neuromuscular junction, the heavy chain of the botulinum neurotoxin binds to glycoprotein structures specifically found on cholinergic nerve terminals. This specific docking is the reason for BT's high selectivity for cholinergic synapses. After internalization, the light chain of the botulinum neurotoxin binds with high specificity to the SNARE protein complex. The target proteins vary among the BT serotypes. BT-A cleaves synaptosomal-associated proteins of 25kDa (SNAP-25). BT-B cleaves vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP), also known as synaptobrevin II.

An October 2013 article in PLoS Pathogens (1) found that several auxiliary proteins produced by the organism bound to botulinum toxin A and facilitated its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract via multivalent interactions with carbohydrate receptors on intestinal epithelial cells. Indeed, in mice, it seemed possible to block the neuromuscular effects of botulinum toxin by blocking absorption using a non-metabolizable galactose analog called isopropyl beta-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside and prolonged median survival time. The same group more recently, in June 2014, published that the same hemagglutinin complex of the progenitor toxin complex bound to E-cadherin, a cell adhesion molecule, as well as carbohydrate binding and facilitated paracellular absorption of the toxin complex (2). Abolishing either the E-cadherin or carbohydrate binding of the toxin complex drastically reduced oral toxicity.
