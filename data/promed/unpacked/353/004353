Deer found dead from EHD virus
------------------------------
The hot, dry part of the year is nearly over, but with it came biting
midges infecting some area deer with EHD, or epizootic hemorrhagic disease.

Hemorrhagic disease is the most infectious among whitetail deer and
is caused by the midges. Each year wildlife officials see some deer
killed by the diseases and this year [2008] is no different.

"We're finding it in Butte County and the prairie units of Lawrence
County," said Mike Apland, a conservation officer with the South
Dakota Game, Fish and Parks. "We've had a few isolated kills in the
St Onge area [Lawrence County]. In the Black Hills, really all we are
seeing is right on the Crow Peak bench, around the Exit 2 and Mirror
Lake area."

Apland said to have it in the Hills is extremely rare and attributed
it to the wet spring and more rain-filled summer.

"It is kind of odd. Usually we don't have anything south of the
interstate as far as EHD die offs," he said. "I talked to a lot of
the ranchers and they said they don't remember seeing an EHD die off
for 15-20 years. It just doesn't happen very often."

Even now the cases Apland and Bill Eastman, his Butte County
counterpart, are finding are not catastrophic by any means.

"It's a pretty isolated kill. I would say conservatively less than 5
percent of the population has been impacted. Most of the hunters
won't be impacted and we won't even see a decline in the deer
population, it's just that we are finding some dead deer," he said.

With the 1st day of fall behind us the cooler weather will kill the
midges and will end the short-lived disease.

"We should be on the end of [it] now," Apland said. "Usually once
those deer come into contact, within 7 to 10 days, it is either fatal
or they make it through. It isn't a lingering disease that they have to worry."

Signs of the disease include extreme weakness, swollen tongue, and
sores on the top of the mouths. EHD usually appears in the driest
part of the year he said and can be transmitted to the deer until the
1st hard frost kills the midges.

"They go into respiratory distress and get a high fever," he said.
"It isn't the midge flies that are in the water, its because they
went to the water to get hydrated and to lower their temperature that
they are getting." [The transmission of the disease is not through
the ingestion of the midge flies but rather through bites of the
midge flies with most frequent exposure to populations of midge flies
being the areas around where the animals go to for their water. - Mod.MPP]

Eastman elaborated. "They'll pretty much have lost their minds,"
Eastman said. "You can approach pretty close to them and they will be
so feverish and out of their minds they may not know you're there. Or
they may not spook till you are right next to them because they are
suffering a high fever."

EHD and its cousin bluetongue were first reported in the US in 1955
and 1968, according to the Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease
Study. The disease affects whitetail deer mostly, but can also be
found in mule deer, bighorn sheep, antelope, and other wild
ruminants. Domestic sheep may develop a severe illness when infected
with bluetongue, but apparently not get sick when infected by EHD.
Death rates are usually well below 25 percent but a few instances
have been 50 percent or more.

With the 1st hunting season upon us hunters should not have to worry
about the disease as people are not at risk by eating infected deer
meat or from the bite of the midge, according to the study.

"It is something that we don't have to worry about for deer season
and human consumption because it has run its course by then. Either
the deer are dead or they are not exposed," Apland said. "If you see
an animal that has distress or whether it is an infection once you
kill the deer, call me or call someone just to be safe. We never
suggest someone eat a deer that is sick or has outward appearance of
any type of disease issue. We have a deer population that we can
replace licenses if we have to so they don't take that chance."

[Epizootic hemorrhagic disease or EHD will cause affected deer to
appear lethargic, perhaps lame, and because of high fever,
disoriented or unresponsive to humans. As the disease progress, there
may be bloody discharge from the nose. Gross lesions may include
sores on the mouth, often the roof of the mouth, and a swollen
cyanotic tongue. The deer stop eating and may become emaciated. The
fever drives them to water because they are hot and dehydrated.
However, they occasionally stop drinking. Often they are found close
to or in water.

In susceptible deer EHDV causes lesions very similar to those caused
by BTV (bluetongue virus). The widespread hemorrhages in mucous
membranes, skin, and viscera are the result of disseminated
intravascular clotting. The Ibaraki strain of EHDV can cause
widespread vascular lesions similar to those described for BTV in
cattle. Degenerative changes (focal hemorrhage or dry and gray-white
appearance, or both) in striated musculature are prominent in the
esophagus, larynx, tongue, and skeletal muscles.

As the article points out, a freeze generally kills the mosquitoes
and midges that transmit the disease. For South Dakota, it should not
be too long until that occurs. Even after a hard frost, it is not
unusual to see some sick and dying deer. The incubation period is
about 10 days so animals infected prior to the frost may not develop
disease until after the frost.
