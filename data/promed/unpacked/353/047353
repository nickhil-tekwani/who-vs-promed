A burial site underneath land earmarked for development in Yeovil could bring the risk of deadly disease contamination, according to local councils. A housing estate featuring 765 homes is planned to be built on land at the outskirts of the town. The redevelopment plans, to the north of Yeovil at Upper Mudford, also include a 65-bed care home, shops, a health centre, and a new primary school.

A decision is expected to be made on the applications "in the coming months," according to a South Somerset District Council (SSDC) spokesman.

However, 2 local parish councils are standing against the proposals on the grounds that there could be a risk of anthrax contamination at the 49 hectare [121 acre] site. Anthrax is a life-threatening infectious disease that normally affects animals but can be transmitted to humans through contact with infected animals or their products. The earmarked site has previously been used by tanneries in Yeovil to bury cattle carcasses.

Citing a report from Public Health England, the parish councils say that anthrax testing done at the site so far has been insufficient.

Solicitor Richard Buxton has written to SSDC on behalf of Queen Thorn Parish Council and Mudford Parish Council to make their concerns clear. A letter reads: "Recently, Land Quality Management received a copy of a letter from Public Health England which confirms that the anthrax testing regime used to date was inadequate, and proposed future sampling needs to be done differently, with more testing holes at different depths. The councils' duty is to require the further investigations to be carried out before it grants consent."

The vice chairman of Mudford Parish Council, Tony Cavalier, has previously described the choice to potentially build on the land as "ludicrous."

"We can't have the council building homes willy-nilly and putting lives at risk; they need to wake up and smell the coffee," he said.

[This is a recurring concern in the UK, though in effect livestock anthrax is eradicated. And tanneries do not get asked to bury carcasses, but there will have been reject hides, including hides from suspect anthrax carcasses. Basically, the district council has to define the actual risk from these dumped tannery hides. Though traditionally anthrax spores are perceived as immortal, the reality is different depending on the pH of the soil; they favour alkaline soils, but even then they die. It is a survival problem that depends on the initial number of spores. If worse comes to worst, make the site a parking lot.

The optimum method for recovering _Bacillus anthracis_ from soil is Antonio Fasanella's GABRI method, which I saw used in relation to clay soils that we collected on 8 farm compounds in Bangladesh in 2010 from places where cattle had been slaughtered and butchered 3 months before, and that had since been walked over daily by cattle, goats, people, dogs, and chickens. See Fasanella A, Di Taranto P, Garofolo G, et al.: Ground anthrax _Bacillus_ refined isolation (GABRI) method for analyzing environmental samples with low levels of _Bacillus anthracis_ contamination. BMC Microbiology. 2013; 13:167. doi:10.1186/1471-2180-13-167. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3728113/. Try it. You will not be disappointed.

To find an old and forgotten cattle grave, walk the field looking for an area, say, 3 m x 2-4 m (about 10 x 6.5-13 ft), more or less, that is sunken by maybe 20-30 cm (about 8-12 in). When the carcasses were buried, they would have been bloated. When they decompose, the earth column above them collapses to produce this slightly sunken place. A good time to search is just after a rain storm when it will have collected rain, making it stand out from the rest of the field. Take soil samples on 2 transects across this place.

The disease essentially stopped in the UK in 1997, benefiting from the controls implemented to stop "mad cow" disease. Latterly there have been some scares -- see posts listed below -- but they amounted to just that. - Mod.MHJ
