The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 12 Apr 2019:
- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 1240, of which 1174 are confirmed and 66 are probable. In total, there were 792 deaths (726 confirmed and 66 probable) and 365 people cured;
- 269 suspected cases are under investigation;
- 20 new confirmed cases, including 16 in Katwa, 1 in Vuhovi, 1 in Mandima, and 2 in Beni;
- 20 new confirmed case deaths, including 12 community deaths, including 10 in Katwa, 1 in Beni, and 1 in Mandima; 8 deaths at CTEs, including 5 in Katwa, 2 in Butembo, and 1 in Beni;
- The community death of Beni is a stillborn baby whose mother, a confirmed case, died at the CTE on 11 Apr [2019]. The baby died during the transfer of the mother to the CTE.
- 1 new healed from the CTE of Butembo.

News of the response

Vaccine efficacy study
--------------------
- The National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have published preliminary results of a study on the efficacy of the rVSV-ZEBOV-GP vaccine to control the Ebola outbreak. The objective of the study was to better understand if the vaccine was effective and help prevent the number of cases when used as part of the belt vaccination strategy. A more detailed analysis is being prepared and will be published in a scientific journal.
- The researchers analyzed the data of those vaccinated between 1 May 2018 and 25 Mar 2019. According to the data collected, the efficiency of the rVSV-GP-ZEBOV vaccine is estimated at 97.5%. These 1st results confirm previous observations on the very high efficacy of the rVSV-ZEBOV-GP against Ebola vaccine to control the spread of the epidemic. The belt vaccination strategy has been shown to be effective because of the rapid protection of those vaccinated after a single injection and the high coverage achieved in the different vaccination belts (91%).
- Of a sample of over 90 000 people vaccinated against Ebola, 71 developed the disease. Of these 71 people, 15 people developed the disease more than 10 days after vaccination, of which 7 were health workers. In this 1st group, no one died of Ebola. The other 56 people developed the 1st symptoms less than 10 days after being vaccinated, that is, before they could develop their immunity. It is estimated that the vaccine takes 10 days to offer maximum immune protection. In this 2nd group, 9 people died. This indicates that the vaccine has reduced the overall mortality rate among the vaccinated people who developed the disease.

Validation workshop of the implementation framework of the 3rd strategic response plan (SRP-3)
-----------------
- From 10-12 Apr 2019, minister of health Dr. Oly Ilunga Kalenga chaired a workshop on the validation of the implementation framework for SRP-3 in Goma. The objective of this workshop was to reframe the implementation of the SRP-3, focusing on 3 specific deliverables, namely to clarify the organizational chart of the response taking into account the new actors, to define a plan of action unique and inclusive by sub-coordination and pillar, as well as to develop an accountability and performance framework for all actors in the national and international response.
- As the minister of health has pointed out, the current Ebola outbreak is taking place in an extremely complex and challenging environment that requires a constant review of response strategies. He emphasized the importance of maintaining a healthy framework for consultation and collaboration among the many national and international organizations involved in this response to ensure the effectiveness of all interventions with greater community involvement.

[The vaccine efficacy is impressive. Additional data are presented in the original report under "[3] vaccine" below. While the vaccine results are reason to be encouraged, sadly, this demonstrates that even a very effective vaccine alone is not sufficient to end this outbreak. Individuals who stay home when sick and die in community centers spread the virus to family members and unknown contacts who may not be identified in time to be vaccinated.

We look forward to more details on the strategic response plan 3, specifically clarification of the organizational chart of the response. Who are the new actors to whom the report refers? NGOs? What is the plan of action by sub-coordination and pillar? How will accountability and performance be measured for all actors in the national and international response? - Mod.LK]

News of the response

Emergency Committee of the World Health Organization
---------------------------
- The meeting of the Emergency Committee for the International Health Regulations, convened by the director-general of WHO, was held on Fri 12 Apr 2019. The emergency committee concluded that the Ebola outbreak in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri did not constitute a public health emergency of international concern. However, the committee expressed its deep concern about the recent increase in transmission in some areas, and thus the potential risk of spread in neighboring countries.

- The committee also commended the efforts of the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo's response teams, the World Health Organization, and partners to contain the epidemic in a complex and difficult environment.

In addition, the committee made the following public health recommendations:
- No restriction of travel or international trade should be imposed; exit screening at airports, ports, and land borders remains an important activity;
- Redouble efforts to detect cases as early as possible, identify and track contacts, and ensure maximum immunization coverage of all contacts and contacts of contacts;
- Increase efforts to prevent nosocomial transmission, and reduce the time between onset of illness and access to quality health care in Ebola treatment centers;
- According special attention to the increasing number of cases in the remaining epicenters, including Butembo, Katwa, Vuhovi, and Mandima;
- Identify, target, and expand dialogue and community participation, involvement of traditional healers, and other techniques to strengthen and broaden community acceptance;
- Implement the latest recommendations of the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on the vaccination strategy, i.e., the inclusion of pregnant women and children under one year of age in the belt vaccination strategy;
- The security of the actors of the response must be a priority, while avoiding the security of interventions;
- Given the very high risk of regional spread, neighboring countries must continue to accelerate their preparedness and surveillance efforts, including immunization of primary care providers;
- Continue to strengthen cross-border collaboration, including data sharing and alerts, cross-border community engagement and awareness raising. In addition, it is also recommended to improve the mapping of population movements and the understanding of social networks that transcend national borders.
- Emergency committee members and counsel met by teleconference. Representatives from the DRC Ministry of Health gave a presentation on the epidemiological situation, response strategies, and recent adaptations, including the strategy to improve community engagement. MONUSCO representatives discussed their logistics and security activities to support the response. Finally, the WHO secretariat presented in detail the situation on the evolution of the current epidemic as well as the preparedness activities in neighboring countries.

- Fri 12 Apr 2019: Outbreak gathers pace
[The Guardian, abridged, edited]
https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/apr/12/emergency-panel-meets-as-congo-ebola-outbreak-gathers-pace
[Byline: Rebecca Ratcliffe]

Experts at an emergency meeting on the recent escalation of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have stopped short of declaring a global health crisis but expressed grave concern over the regional threat posed by the rising number of cases.

Health experts warn that suspicion and rumours -- such as that Ebola is being exploited by agencies for financial reasons -- are rife. The response to the outbreak, which coincided with long-delayed elections, has also been politicised after voting was suspended in Ebola-affected areas. More than a quarter of people surveyed in such areas said they do not believe Ebola exists.

The reluctance of private facilities or traditional healers to refer patients to specialist Ebola treatment centres has also contributed to case numbers.

"This is the moment where we really have to look at the approach and see what we can change," said Natalie Roberts, emergency operations manager for MSF. "[This means] working more with communities and trying to integrate into existing health systems, not having a parallel Ebola system. That would be a lot more acceptable [to communities], but also a lot more effective at finding cases early."

Roberts added that other possibilities were under consideration, including the introduction of a 2nd vaccine and post-exposure therapy. "What we would like is also be able to give some post-exposure prophylaxis [post-exposure treatment] to family members," said Roberts. "We think it could probably have an effect."

Such therapies remain experimental.

Roberts added: "The 2 biggest [risk factors] we are seeing is having someone [with Ebola] within your family, because you're close to them in the household and you tend to be caring for them when they're sick. The other big one is transmission within a [general] health facility."

- Fri 12 Apr 2019. WHO decision - no PHEIC
[STAT News, abridged, edited]
https://www.statnews.com/2019/04/12/who-stops-short-of-declaring-ebola-crisis-a-global-health-emergency/
[Byline: Helen Branswell]

The Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo still does not warrant the declaration of a global health emergency, the World Health Organization said Friday [12 Apr 2019], a decision that is sure to trigger substantial debate as the virus continues to spread unabated.

The case count in the 8-month-old Ebola outbreak, already the 2nd-largest on record, topped 1200 on Thursday [11 Apr 2019] and has surged by double digits most days over the past 2 weeks, a far faster rate than earlier in the epidemic.

The decision was made by WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on the basis of a recommendation by a committee of outside experts that has now concluded twice that the outbreak does not warrant an emergency declaration.

"I have accepted their advice," Tedros, as he is known, said during a news conference in Geneva.

The panel's chairman, Robert Steffen, said declaring an emergency would provide no added benefit given that the WHO was already receiving significant support for the effort to control the outbreak. He acknowledged, though, that the committee was concerned by the recent spike in cases.

"But ... there is an explanation for these rising numbers," Steffen said, noting that the new cases are concentrated in or originating from Katwa and Butembo, where the outbreak response teams have had difficulty gaining the cooperation of the communities. "There was turmoil in these areas, which were just not accessible for a certain period of time."

Given the success the response has achieved stopping transmission chains elsewhere, "we are moderately optimistic that this outbreak can be brought into control. Not immediately, but still within a foreseeable time," Steffen said.

Declaring a public health emergency of international concern -- called a PHEIC for short -- would raise the level attention it receives from the WHO's member countries. It would also likely increase the amount of human and financial resources that countries are willing to contribute to the effort to stop the outbreak.

Tom Inglesby, director of the Center for Health Security at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, disagreed with the call.
"I do think it's a mistake. I do think conditions have been met for declaring it. It's at least as serious as public health emergencies of international concern that have been declared so in the past," Inglesby told STAT. "And I think it's a mistake, because I think it could have drawn in more international attention, political will, and support."

More must be done to contain this outbreak, he insisted. "It needs to be made clear to all those who are involved that the current course that we're on, despite the resources being brought to bear, despite WHO being completely in and flat out, it's not enough," Inglesby said.

The WHO, which along with DRC's ministry of health is leading the outbreak response, has been under pressure for some time to declare a PHEIC, which is a tool of the International Health Regulations, a treaty to which WHO's member states are party. Its 1st decision not to do so came in October [2018].

David Fidler, a professor of global health law at Indiana University's Maurer School of Law, warned that such a declaration would not on its own change the trajectory of this outbreak.

Robert Steffen, chairman of the WHO International Health Regulations Emergency Committee, said there is no added benefit in declaring an emergency at this time. "If it stays within a country, it is, by definition, not an issue of international concern," he explained. However, he emphasized that this does not downplay the situation and said everything must still be done to stop this outbreak. The committee's decision was "almost unanimous," Steffen said.

WHO defines a public health emergency of international concern as "an extraordinary event" that constitutes a "public health risk to other states through the international spread of disease" and "to potentially require a coordinated international response."

Lawrence O. Gostin, a professor of global health law and director of the WHO Collaborating Center on Global Health Law at Georgetown University, wrote in an email that, given worsening conditions in Congo, Tedros "should have declared a [public health emergency of international concern] and made bold new recommendations for bringing the DRC Ebola epidemic under control."

"The legal criteria for declaring a [public health emergency of international concern] have been met for several months now," he said. "The International Health Regulations do not require actual international spread but only the potential for international spread."

The International Health Regulations, which are legally binding for all WHO member states, aim to help the global community prevent and respond to acute public health risks that have the potential to cross borders and threaten people worldwide.

"Clearly, the DRC epidemic could spill over to neighboring countries and even to other parts of Africa, even potentially through air travel to North America and Europe," Gostin said.

[NY Post, abridged, edited]
https://nypost.com/2019/04/12/rise-in-congo-ebola-cases-sparks-new-fears-of-epidemic/

A top Red Cross official said Friday [12 Apr 2019] he's "more concerned than I have ever been" about the possible regional spread of the Ebola virus after a new spike in cases."

Excerpts:

Trish Newport, Doctors Without Borders' representative in Goma, a major crossroads city close to the outbreak, said declaring a global emergency wouldn't necessarily help stop the epidemic. "Bigger is not necessarily better," she said.

Doctors Without Borders is calling for patients to be treated in existing health centers rather than Ebola-specific clinics. "It's very clear that people do not like or trust the Ebola centers, and they are not coming to be treated."

Newport said 75% of new Ebola cases have no obvious link to previous patients, meaning that officials have lost track of where the virus is spreading.

Emergency declarations almost always boost global attention and donor funding. In recent weeks, WHO has noted it is woefully short of the $148 million it says is needed to fight Ebola for the next 6 months. It had received only USD 74 million as of mid-March [2019].

Tariq Riebl, who is based in a current Ebola hotspot, Butembo, for the International Rescue Committee, said a major obstacle to stopping the outbreak is that officials are simply unaware of how many Ebola cases there are.

"We're discovering people when it's way too late," he said, noting numerous cases were buried in secret and never reported to authorities.

[Byline: Julia Belluz]

Despite the rapidly mounting Ebola cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo, experts at the World Health Organization on Friday [12 Apr 2019] decided not to declare a global health emergency.

In October [2018], the health agency's expert panel offered similar reasoning. Then the WHO noted that not a single Ebola case has been exported beyond the borders of the DRC, and that an international response was already well underway. The panel was confident the DRC had plenty of experience responding to the virus.

In the past week alone, there were 74 new cases, the most of any week since the outbreak was identified in August [2018]. And to date, at least 740 people have died out of more than 1100 cases. That makes the DRC's outbreak the 2nd-largest known Ebola outbreak in history, following only the 2014-2016 epidemic in West Africa.

And while Ebola hasn't yet spread across international borders, cases were recently identified at an airport in the DRC.

"The Ebola outbreak in DRC is serious," Tom Frieden, the president of Resolve to Save Lives and former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told Vox. "Cases are increasing, and there's decreasing ability to stop spread because of insecurity. It's hard to see how you can make a strong argument about this not being a PHEIC."

Lawrence Gostin, Georgetown Law's chair in global health law, also believed it's time to trigger the emergency declaration and rethink the response. "The WHO can't expect to play by the old public health rulebook and expect to succeed in the context of persistent violence and community distrust."

Tom Inglesby, director of the Center for Health Security of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, was also surprised by the negative decision. "We've reached a new moment of seriousness in this outbreak, and WHO has not gotten the resources it needs to respond to this outbreak in full capacity," he said.

And it's not just that this is the worst week in terms of new cases since the outbreak started, Inglesby continued. "It's what's behind the numbers. We have a high percentage of people who are appearing with Ebola after they've died. We have a lot of people who have Ebola but are invisible to the response community. That's why those numbers are going up."

But there are reasons WHO experts might opt against triggering the PHEIC alarm, even in serious outbreaks.

Despite all the dangerous outbreaks in recent years, the WHO has only declared a public health emergency 4 times since the International Health Regulations, which govern global health emergency responses, were enacted in 2007.

The 1st time was in 2009, with the outbreak of the H1N1 swine flu pandemic. The 2nd time was in May 2014, when polio seemed to surge again, threatening the eradication effort. The 3rd time, in August 2014, came as the Ebola outbreak in West Africa was growing out of control. And the 4th: In February 2016, the Zika outbreak across South and Central America was declared a PHEIC.

And that's because these decisions are not taken lightly. 1st, the PHEIC is a political tool used to focus the world's attention on a health crisis. Using this declaration too often would weaken its significance. 2nd, one of the key considerations in declaring a PHEIC is whether the disease threat is dire enough for countries to be forced into enacting travel and trade restrictions. These can be devastating to local economies.

Health emergency declarations are often associated with economic losses, even when the WHO only warns people to limit or delay travel to affected regions (instead of outright travel restrictions).

If this outbreak continues to spiral, however, the WHO risks reputational damage for not declaring an emergency sooner.

"Whether the Ebola outbreak in the DRC technically is or is not a [PHEIC] is beside the point," said America's former Ebola response coordinator, Ron Klain. "The response is failing to get the disease under control." And unlike the 2014-2016 West Africa outbreak, DRC responders have an Ebola vaccine to work with, he added.

"The WHO has decided that this is not a PHEIC. But that does not change the grim reality that it is an emergency, and the international community needs to get a lot more concerned, right away, said Klain."

[3] Vaccine
- Preliminary results
Fri 12 Apr 2019
[WHO, abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/ebola/ebola-ring-vaccination-results-12-april-2019.pdf?ua=1

Preliminary results on the efficacy of rVSV-ZEBOV-GP Ebola vaccine using the ring vaccination strategy in the control of an Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo: an example of integration of research into epidemic response [as discussed in MoH report 13 Apr 2019].

Analysis
---------
Figure 1: Number of confirmed EVD cases by the national surveillance system of DRC, number of cases included in the ring vaccination, and number of cases among vaccinated individuals.

Table 1. Baseline characteristics of index cases and rings (1 Aug 2018-25 Mar 2019).

Table 2: Distribution of all confirmed EVD cases among all eligible, consented, and vaccinated people at risk

Key public health messages arising from this information
1. These early results confirm previous observations of high efficacy of rVSV-ZEBOV-GP Ebola vaccine against disease (2, 3). We note that this is an observational study with the inherent methodological limitations. The ring vaccination strategy works because of the rapid protection after single dose, and high coverage achieved in the rings (91%).
2. No deaths were reported among vaccinees who developed Ebola with onset 10 or more days after vaccination. Moreover, the overall case fatality rate was reduced among all vaccinees who developed Ebola. Therefore, there is high vaccine efficacy against death.
3. Vaccination of HCWs/FLWs in the affected areas have provided information on the efficacy of this vaccine in preventing disease and death due to Ebola among HCWs/FLWs.
4. The ring vaccination strategy is a highly efficient delivery strategy for Ebola vaccines during outbreaks. Only 2 contacts of contacts developed EVD, suggesting ring vaccination is effective in preventing tertiary generation of cases. This concept, which is based on smallpox eradication strategies (7), considers the fact that Ebola transmits mainly through human-to-human contact, has a relatively long serial interval (i.e., 2 weeks), and that the people at risk of contracting the disease can be identified (contacts and contacts of contacts). It is also efficient for teams operating in an insecure context and is a dose sparing vaccination strategy.
5. Integration of research into the outbreak response has facilitated the further assessment of this candidate Ebola vaccine, while contributing to the control of the outbreak. It is feasible to rapidly and effectively implement ring vaccination using a yet-to-be licensed Ebola vaccine in an outbreak setting and to integrate this innovative strategy with the more traditional Ebola control measures. The fact that a protocol was available and trained teams and equipment could be promptly deployed meant that ring vaccination was initiated only 7 days after the declaration of the outbreak.

- Fri 12 Apr 2019. WHO stops short of declaring Ebola crisis a global health emergency.
[STAT News, abridged, edited]
https://www.statnews.com/2019/04/12/the-data-are-clear-ebola-vaccine-shows-very-impressive-performance-in-outbreak/
[Byline: Helen Branswell]

The experimental Ebola vaccine being used to try to contain the outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is protective 97.5% of the time, according to new data released by the World Health Organization on Friday [12 Apr 2019].

The data -- the 1st to be released on how the vaccine is working in the outbreak -- suggest a "very impressive" performance by the vaccine, said Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Diseases Research and Policy, who reviewed the report for STAT.

Of more than 90 000 people who were vaccinated, only 71 went on to develop Ebola. Of these, 56 developed symptoms fewer than 10 days after being vaccinated, suggesting the vaccine had not yet had time to fully protect them. It is believed it takes about 10 days for immune protection to develop after vaccination.

Only 15 people developed Ebola more than 10 days after being vaccinated, the report said. Seven of them were healthcare workers. Nearly 29 000 healthcare and frontline workers were among the roughly 90 000 vaccinated between last August [2018] and 25 Mar [2019], the time period covered by the report.

None of the people who developed Ebola 10 days or more after being vaccinated died from their illness.

"Notably, there were 9 deaths among 56 cases with onset of symptoms 0-9 days after vaccination [who are assumed to be only partially protected by vaccination] and no deaths among people where the illness onset occurred 10 days or more after they were vaccinated [who are assumed to be protected by vaccination]," the report said.

The data were posted on the WHO's website [see previous report] following a meeting of a panel of experts asked to advise director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on whether the outbreak in the DRC should be declared a public health emergency of international concern. The committee concluded that the epidemic, though increasingly serious, does not constitute a global threat at this time.

The WHO has been under pressure to release data on the vaccine's effectiveness. Osterholm said it was critical that the agency share what it is finding.

"I think it's very important because it helps give the world a better sense of how effective this vaccine is. And that the real challenges are not about 'Does the vaccine work?' It's whether the vaccine gets used," he said. "The problem is not because you have an inferior vaccine response. Frankly this is outstanding. The challenge is getting it into people."
