The wheat disease, soil-borne wheat mosaic virus, has made itself
known this spring [2010] in parts of southern Washington and
northeastern Oregon. This is the 2nd time it has appeared, but this
time it is more noticeable and wider spread than 2 years ago
according to local crop consultant Jerry Zahl of Walla Walla.

2 years ago affected areas were small and limited to low lying areas.
This time around more fields are affected and larger areas are
showing symptoms. Areas near Milton-Freewater (Oregon) and east of
Walla Walla (Washington) are again seeing the disease.

The impact of the virus on the affected areas is unknown at this time
and will be determined largely by the weather and related growing
conditions this coming spring. The diseased wheat foliage exhibits
mosaic symptoms similar to wheat streak mosaic, which is already
known to occur in the region, but wheat streak mosaic is expressed
later in the growing season.

[_Soil-borne wheat mosaic virus_ (SBWMV; genus _Furovirus_) occurs
in many countries from various parts of the world. It causes one of
the few diseases of winter wheat that can destroy an entire crop of a
susceptible cultivar. Yield loss depends on virus strain, crop
variety, and environmental conditions. Symptoms vary and may include
mild green to prominent yellow leaf mottling, rosetting, and moderate
to severe stunting of plants. SBWMV is transmitted by the
soil-inhabiting fungus _Polymyxa graminis_. The virus can survive for
several years in soil and dry crop residues protected by the fungus.
It is spread in contaminated soil, by water, and mechanical means but
is not seed-transmitted. Disease management relies mainly on use of
resistant wheat cultivars.

The SBWMV spread reported above includes an area extending across the
border of the 2 neighbouring states. The other disease mentioned is
_Wheat streak mosaic virus_ (WSMV; genus _Tritimovirus_), which is
prevalent in North America and is spread by the wheat curl mite (for
more information see links below).
