USA: Weaker Strain of Monkeypox Responsible for Outbreak in 2003
----------------------------------------------------------------
The outbreak of monkeypox that occurred in the United States in the summer of
2003 didn't cause any deaths because the strain of virus that caused the
outbreak is the less virulent of 2 known strains of monkeypox, researchers
report. During the outbreak, health officials counted 72 confirmed or suspected
cases of human monkeypox, but no deaths. The disease usually kills about 10
percent of infected people.
"We have at least 2 biological strains of monkeypox virus -- one on the west
coast of Africa, and the other in the Congo basin. The 2003 outbreak in the
United States was from West Africa. If it had come from the Congo, we might
have had a bigger problem on our hands and very well might have seen patient
deaths," study senior author Mark Buller of Saint Louis University Health
Sciences Center, said in a prepared statement.
Monkeypox belongs to a family of viruses that causes human smallpox, cowpox,
camelpox [and includes several other related orthoviruses]. Monkeypox symptoms
include fever, respiratory problems, and pus-filled blisters on the body.
Monkeypox is a zoonosis -- an animal disease that can be transmitted to humans.
Recent studies suggest that cases of monkeypox in Africa are on the rise due to
human encroachment into the habitats of animals that carry the virus, Buller
said.
The U.S. outbreak was caused by a shipment of West African rodents imported for
the pet trade. At a pet distribution center, the African rodents infected
prairie dogs that were sold as pets. The findings are reported in the July
issue of the Journal "Virology" [see below].

USA: Monkeypox Outbreak in 2003 Involved Weaker Virus
-----------------------------------------------------
Monkeypox virus, a less deadly relative of smallpox virus, kills up to 10
percent of its victims in Africa. Yet the monkeypox outbreak 2 years ago in the
United States killed no one, and scientists have wondered why.
Now they have a good idea. New research finds that there are 2 distinct strains
of the virus, and that the U.S. outbreak involved the weaker West African
strain rather than the more deadly Congolese strain. The illness was spread by
prairie dogs after they were infected by imported African rodents at a pet
distribution center. "If it had come from Congo, we might have had a bigger
problem on our hands and very well might have seen patient deaths,"said Mark
Buller, a St. Louis University virologist who led the federally funded study,
published on Fri 15 Jul 2005 in "Virology" [see below].
Scientists from the U.S. Army Research Institute of Infectious Diseases
[USAMRIID], the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], and 4 other
universities in the United States and Canada worked on the report.
The monkeypox outbreak 2 summers ago was the 1st in the Western Hemisphere. An
estimated 72 people in the Midwest were sickened by the virus, which causes
blisters and a rash that resemble smallpox. Cases were reported in Wisconsin,
Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Ohio & Missouri. 16 people were hospitalized, though
not all were sick. 2 children required intensive care and recovered. The
monkeypox outbreak included 39 confirmed or suspected cases from Wisconsin,
where the disease was first detected. The initial case involved a 3-year-old
child in Wausau, who got it from a pet prairie dog her mother bought at a 4-H
swap meet in the spring of 2003. It and other infected prairie dogs had been
housed near imported Gambian rats by animal distributors.
Doctors thought better U.S. medical care and generally better health than in
Africa were the reasons no one died. But genetic analysis suggests the germ
itself made the difference. Researchers compared several strains similar to the
West African one in the U.S. outbreak to a Congolese strain from a gene bank.
They also looked back at previously unpublished experiments Army researchers
had done in the 1990s on such viruses in monkeys as part of an effort to find
ways to test new smallpox vaccines. Monkeys infected with the West African
strain got only mildly ill and none died. 5 out of 6 of those given the other
strain got severely ill and all 3 that got the higher dose of it died.
After the 2003 outbreak, federal officials banned the importation of African
rodents and the sale of U.S. prairie dogs [but is exchanging them at a "swap
meet" -- see above -- still legal? - Mod.JW], but importing animals from other
countries is still legal, along with breeding captive exotic and wild
animals. "We definitely are better off than we were" before the outbreak in
terms of regulation, said Dr. Marty Cetron, the CDC's director of quarantine,
but he added, "there's still more that could be done." "We do think there is a
risk of emerging infections being spread by or amplified by the exotic pet
trade," he said [but prairie dogs are not exotic in the sense of not imported.-
Mod.JW].

The paper is authored by Nanhai Chen and 15 others and is entitled: " Virulence
differences between monkeypox virus isolates from West Africa and the Congo
basin".
The Abstract of the paper reads as follows: "Studies indicate that West African
and Congo basin isolates of monkeypox virus (MPXV) are genetically distinct.
Here, we show Congo basin MPXV-ZAI-V79 is more virulent for cynomolgus monkeys
as compared to presumed West African MPXV-COP-58. This finding may explain the
lack of case-fatalities in the U.S. 2003 monkeypox outbreak, which was caused
by a West African virus. Virulence differences between West African and Congo
basin MPXV are further supported by epidemiological analyses that observed a
similar prevalence of antibodies in non-vaccinated humans in both regions,
while more than 90 percent of reported cases occurred in the Congo basin, and
no fatal cases were observed outside of this region. To determine the basis for
this difference in virulence, we sequenced the genomes of one human West
African isolate, and 2 presumed West African isolates and compared the
sequences to Congo basin MPXV-ZAI-96-I-16. The analysis identified D10L, D14L,
B10R, B14R, and B19R as possible virulence genes, with D14L (ortholog of
vaccinia complement protein) as a leading candidate." - Mod.CP]
