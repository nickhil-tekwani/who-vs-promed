[1] News describing COVID-19 in farmed minks

A coronavirus infection among mink being raised on 2 fur farms in the Netherlands has forced the closure of several roads with people warned not to come within 400 meters [approx. 0.25 mi] of the farms. The 2 locations are in Gemert-Bakel and Laarbeek, about 10 km [approx. 6.2 mi] apart in the province of Noord-Brabant.

The virus was believed to be spread from humans at the farms to the mink, and not the other way around.

"As a precautionary measure, RIVM [public health agency] is advising against cycling or walking within a radius of approximately 400 meters [approx. 0.25 mi] around the infected mink farm until the results of the research on the air and dust samples are known," the agriculture ministry said in a statement. The mayors of the 2 municipalities will carry out the necessary road closures.

Mink were found to be carrying the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the variant of coronavirus responsible for respiratory illness COVID-19. "The minks showed various symptoms including respiratory problems," the ministry said. "Investigations have been launched to determine the source of the infections."

Workers at both farms tested positive for the virus, and are believed to have passed the infection on to the mink. The ministry pointed out that mink and ferrets belong to the same animal family, with earlier research showing that the latter are susceptible to COVID-19.

"Human to animal contamination is possible, but the impact of this mink contamination on human health is currently negligible. Human to human contamination is the driving force behind the current coronavirus pandemic," the ministry said.

"There is currently no reason to believe that the virus spreads in these mink farms in any other way than it does between humans," the ministry said. All Dutch mink farmers, veterinarians, and researchers will be required to report any respiratory problems or increased mortality in mink.

The ministry wants more research to be done to determine if the virus spreads the same way among livestock as it does among humans. "While it is not expected that the virus will spread over longer distances, air and dust samples are also taken in the vicinity of the company as a precaution," the ministry said.

Two mink farms in Gemert-Bakel and Laarbeek have detected infection of COVID-19 in different minks. The minks showed various clinical signs including respiratory problems. Investigations have been launched to determine the source of the infections. Because some employees had symptoms of the coronavirus at both companies, it is assumed that people infected the animals. Previous research showed that ferrets, and therefore also minks, are susceptible to COVID-19. There are currently no indications that farm animals or pets play a role in the spread of COVID-19.

Minister of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality (NVWA) has immediately announced measures. As of today [Sun 26 Apr 2020], a reporting obligation has been introduced for mink farmers, veterinarians and persons in research institutions. If there are respiratory problems and increased mortality in minks, this must be reported to the NVWA. To prevent possible spread of the virus to other farms, both animals and manure must not leave an infected farm. Since other livestock animals do not appear to be susceptible to the virus, a notification requirement is now only imposed for minks.

It is important to know how the disease develops on the infected farms. This knowledge can be used to better understand the disease and its course in animals and humans. Therefore, samples are collected from sick and healthy animals. These will be used for further investigation. Although the virus is not expected to spread over longer distances, air and dust samples are also taken in the vicinity of the company as a precaution. These are being examined to see whether virus can be detected in this. The Lower House will be informed as soon as more information becomes available about the outcome of this investigation.

According to the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), based on current knowledge about COVID-19, the mink companies do not pose a risk of further spread to humans. Human to animal contamination is possible, but the impact of this mink contamination on human health is currently negligible. Human to human contamination is the driving force behind the current pandemic.

There is currently no reason to believe that the virus spreads in these mink farms in any other way than it does between humans. As a precautionary measure, RIVM advises against cycling or walking within a radius of approximately 400 meters [approx. 0.25 mi] around the infected mink farm until the results of the research on the air and dust samples are known. It was decided to close the public road in this radius around the company for pedestrians and cyclists until the results of the research are known. The mayors of both municipalities will soon take this measure.

[Infection by SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed so far in carnivores of 3 families, canids (dogs), felids (cats, tigers, and lions), and mustelids (ferrets). Infection in cats and ferrets has been confirmed experimentally, whereas the virus was shown to replicate poorly in dogs following inoculation. Minks (_Neovison vison_) belong to the same family as ferrets (_Mustela putorius_). Ferrets are used as animal models for infectious diseases. Due to this and to the fact that they are also used as pets, ferrets were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 experimentally in 2 independent experiments, where it was found that they, as cats, are permissive to infection. This episode in farmed minks represents the 1st report of naturally infected mustelids. - Mod.PMB
