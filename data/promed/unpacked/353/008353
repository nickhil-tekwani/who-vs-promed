Deadly seal virus spreads to Scotland
-------------------------------------
Phocine distemper virus (PDV) has been confirmed by vets in Inverness in a
common seal found washed ashore at Dornoch on the Moray Firth. The Scottish
Environment Minister, Ross Finnie, said it was a worrying development for
Scotland's coastal communities. He said: "We are working closely with a
group of organisations to coordinate a response to the latest outbreak.
We'll put in place a range of measures to minimise its impact."
The virus has already killed around one third of the seal population off
the east coast of England around the Wash. It has also killed animals
throughout the waters of northern Europe. There is no known cure for the
virus, nor any way of preventing it. Although the virus is not dangerous to
humans, people are being advised not touch any seals washed ashore and to
keep their dogs away.
In 1988, an outbreak of the PDV virus caused the death of 17 000 to 18 000
common seals and 300 to 400 grey seals throughout northern Europe. In
Scotland more than 1300 common seals died.

[In the last status report (No 7, 26 Sep 2002) "Information on Phocine
Distemper Virus in the UK" on the (recommended) web site of the Sea Mammal
Research Unit (SMRU) in St Andrews, Scotland, the following data are
published: "In Scotland there has now been a total of 114 reported dead
seals (18 common seals, 20 grey seals, and 76 species indeterminate). 9
postmortem examinations have been carried out and 2 are pending, but all
tests to date have been negative for PDV"
<http://www.smru.st-and.ac.uk/pdv/pdvgen.htm>. From this BBC item it
appears that a first laboratory confirmation of PDV has now been obtained,
from a common seal. - Mod.AS]
