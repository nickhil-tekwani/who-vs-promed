98/086 Detection method for tomato infectious chlorosis closterovirus
Tomato infectious chlorosis closterovirus has newly been described in
California, US (EPPO RS 97/035). This virus occurs in glasshouses
throughout California and infects several important ornamental and
vegetable crops (tomato, tomatillo (_Physalis ixocarpa_), potato,
artichoke, lettuce, petunia). It is transmitted in a semi-persistent manner
by _Trialeurodes vaporariorum_. Tomato infectious chlorosis closterovirus
(TICV) is a bipartite single-stranded RNA genome virus. It has long
flexuous, filamentous particles (850 to 900 x 12 nm). Four detection
methods (ELISA, Western blot, dot blot, RT-PCR) were developed, compared
and used to study the distribution of TICV in plants and the relationships
among isolates.
The comparative study of the four methods indicated that RT-PCR was
100-fold more sensitive than ELISA, Western blot and dot blot hybridization
assays for the detection of TICV. It was also observed that TICV was
detected in leaf, stem, flower and root tissues of infected tomato plants.
However, the distribution of the virus within the plant was not uniform and
the highest viral concentration was observed in fully developed young
tomato leaves at the onset of yellowing symptoms. Five isolates of TICV
were studied: three isolates from California, one from North Carolina and
one from Italy (there were previously no indication that TICV was present
in other US States and in Italy). No serological or molecular differences
could be observed between those five isolates.
