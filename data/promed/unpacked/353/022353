The diagnosis of Chagas [disease, trypanosomiasis] that was issued by
the National Institute of Health (INS), on the unusual death of a
young Palonegro airport operator from Lebrija [Santander department],
which occurred on [Dec 2009]; the confirmation of [trypanosomiasis]
infection on 2 ill co-workers of the fatal victim; and the detection
of 6 [additional] cases of this disease [trypanosomiasis] were
questioned on Tuesday [13 Jan 2009] .

Just one month after the 1st death, and despite receiving treatment
for Chagas disease, one of the airport workers who were infected
[with trypanosomiasis] died on [6 Jan 2009].

Due to the possible ineffectiveness of the treatment he was given,
relatives of those affected and some people are challenging the
diagnosis. However, health authorities confirmed the INS medical
opinion, which indicated that Chagas disease [trypanosomiasis] was
the cause of the strange symptoms and the 2 deaths already reported
in the region.

Given the alarm that has been generated, the Regional Health
Department made a call to the public to trust the diagnosis and the
work done by the National Institute of Health and the regional authorities.

"The diagnosis was not given without adequate scientific support. We
are completely confident that this is not an unknown outbreak but
rather it is due to Chagas disease [trypanosomiasis]."

"We have taken samples from 134 people, of whom 9 were positive.
Moreover, screening tests performed on all the work contacts of the 3
patients and we did not detect the disease [trypanosomiasis] in any
of them, so there is certainty that the airport is not the center of
the outbreak," said Julian Nino, the Deputy Director of Public Health
in Santander.

Surveillance plan
-----------------
While Alba Nury Ramirez, the Coordinator of Public Health [disease]
Surveillance, said it was "an unexpected outbreak of Chagas disease
[trypanosomiasis], with an unusual evolution, it is very likely due
to oral transmission. It is important that people know that severe
disease can be prevented with timely treatment."

Although still unaware of the exact cause of the outbreak [in this
case, "cause" is referring to the mode of transmission - Mod.MPP],
the health authorities are not ruling out the [possibility] of
identifying new cases, considering that Santander is an endemic zone
for this disease. Therefore, investigations to detect and control the
outbreak will continue, Ramirez said.

The disease
-----------
- The disease has an infectious origin caused by the parasite
_Trypanosoma cruzi_.
- In Colombia, the vectors of the parasite are known popularly as
'pitos' ('whistles'; _Triatoma infestans_, in English "kissing bug"),
insects that have an affinity for blood [feed on human blood].
- Oral transmission can occur in several ways: consumption of drinks
contaminated with feces of infected pitos, by consumption of infected
meat from wild mammals and inadequately cooked, or by ingestion of
blood from these animals. This type of transmission of infection
[oral] has led to outbreaks of acute Chagas disease that is
characterized by severe clinical manifestations and with considerable
mortality.

Questions and answers
---------------------
What has happened to the other people who were diagnosed with this disease?
All are undergoing treatment under the medical supervision of
specialists and up to the present have not reported complications.
Health care and epidemiologic [studies] continue for them.

Some people, especially families of the 2 fatal victims, suspect that
it is something other than Chagas ...
We have evidence of the samples taken from the patients that confirm
the cause of their deaths. And so far we cannot give further
information because that is the result of all tests performed. The
diagnosis was confirmed on tissues taken from those affected, the
result showed that the heart muscle was found to have _Trypanosoma
cruzi_ parasites. So from the official side we are confident because
we have followed the appropriate procedures.

Why, despite having been treated for Chagas disease
[trypanosomiasis], the treatment did not work for the 2nd fatal victim?
In the 2nd fatal case, we believe that due to the amount of parasite
found in the body, the damage caused by the parasites was so
extensive that the cardiac fibers were not able to regenerate in
spite of receiving adequate treatment.

Julian Nino, the Deputy Director of the Regional Public Health
[Department] of Santander, responded to some concerns on the outbreak
of Chagas.

Step by step ...
Disease control
---------------
1. Chemical control using insecticides in homes.
2. Improving households.
3. Community IEC [information, education and communication]
4. Paying attention to the storage and handling of food and
beverages, especially those that will not be cooked.
5. Avoiding the consumption of meat of wild animals and ensure proper cooking.
6. Do not leave food exposed to animals.
7. Proper waste management to prevent insects or rodents from roam
around the home.

[The oral mode of transmission of Chagas disease is being
increasingly recognized in the region. Its occurrence is associated
with the contamination of fresh food or beverages with intestinal
contents of triatomines (usually wild) infected from natural
reservoirs. This is a form of the disease that is associated with an
increased morbidity and unusual clinical manifestations, and can also
occur in urban areas where vectoral transmission does not exist. - Mod.JT]
