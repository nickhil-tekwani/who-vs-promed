Polio in the Syrian Arab Republic - update [11 Nov 2013]
--------------------------------------------------------
To date 13 cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) have been confirmed in the Syrian Arab Republic. Genetic sequencing indicates that the isolated viruses are most closely linked to virus detected in environmental samples in Egypt in December 2012 (which in turn had been linked to wild poliovirus [WPV] circulating in Pakistan). Closely related wild poliovirus strains have also been detected in environmental samples in Israel, West Bank and Gaza Strip since February 2013. Wild poliovirus had not been detected in the Syrian Arab Republic since 1999.

A comprehensive outbreak response continues to be implemented across the region. On [24 Oct 2013], an already-planned large-scale supplementary immunization activity was launched in the Syrian Arab Republic to vaccinate 1.6 million children against polio, measles, mumps, and rubella, in both government-controlled and contested areas. Implementation of a supplementary immunization campaign in Deir Al Zour province commenced promptly when the 1st 'hot' acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases were reported. Larger-scale outbreak response across the Syrian Arab Republic and neighbouring countries will continue for at least 6-8 months depending on the area and based on the evolving situation.

Given the current situation in the Syrian Arab Republic, frequent population movements across the region and the immunization level in key areas, the risk of further international spread of wild poliovirus type 1 across the region is considered to be high. A surveillance alert has been issued for the region to actively search for additional potential cases.

WHO's International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to and from polio-infected areas be fully vaccinated against polio.

Highlights of the week
----------------------
- 13 cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) have been confirmed in the Syrian Arab Republic. Genetic sequencing indicates that the isolated viruses are most closely linked to virus detected in environmental samples in Egypt in December 2012 (which in turn had been linked to wild poliovirus circulating in Pakistan). Closely related wild poliovirus strains have also been detected in environmental samples in Israel, and The West Bank and Gaza Strip since February 2013. A comprehensive outbreak response continues to be implemented across the sub-region.
- The number of WPV1 cases in Pakistan for 2013 (59) now exceeds the number of polio cases reported from Pakistan during the same time period in 2012 (54). Nigeria has reported half the cases (51/101) and Afghanistan one third (9/27) of cases compared to the same time period in 2012.

Afghanistan
-----------
- No new WPV1 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV cases for 2013 remains 9 (all WPV1), of which all were reported from the Eastern Region, close to the Pakistan border. The most recent WPV1 case was reported from Chapa Dara district, Kunar province, with onset of paralysis on [27 Sep 2013].
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2013 remains 3. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [13 Mar 2013] (from Kandahar, Southern Region).

Nigeria
-------
- No new WPV cases were reported this week. The total number of WPV cases for 2013 remains 51 (all WPV1). The most recent WPV1 case in the country had onset of paralysis on [8 Oct 2013] from Kumbotso, Kano state.
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 remains one (with onset of paralysis in the most recently reported case on [6 Jun 2013], from Borno).
- OPV was administered along with measles vaccine during Child Health Days (CHDs) in the north and the middle of the country on [5-9 Oct 2013] and in middle-band and southern states in [2-6 Nov 2013]. SNIDs [subnational immunization days] are planned for northern states starting mid-November [2013].

Pakistan
--------
- 3 new WPV1 cases were reported in the past week -- 2 from Toba Tek Singh district in Punjab and one from North Waziristan in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA).
- The total number of WPV1 cases for Pakistan in 2013 is now 59. The most recent WPV1 case had onset of paralysis on [21 Oct 2013] (from Toba Tek Singh district, Punjab). The majority of WPV1 cases in Pakistan this year [2013], 41 (69 percent), are from FATA, of which 16 are from Khyber Agency and 18 from North Waziristan.
- 3 new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week, all from North Waziristan. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for Pakistan is now 35. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis [15 Oct 2013] (from North Waziristan).
- The situation in North Waziristan is increasingly alarming. It is the area with the largest number of children being paralyzed by poliovirus in all of Asia (18 WPV1 and 28 cVDPV2 cases). Immunization activities have been suspended by local leaders since June 2012. It is critical that children in these areas are vaccinated and protected from poliovirus. Immunizations in neighboring high-risk areas are being intensified, to further boost population immunity levels in those areas and prevent further spread of this outbreak.
- NIDs [national immunization days] were conducted on [30 Sep to 2 Oct 2013]. SNIDs were conducted on [14-16 Oct 2013] using bOPV [bivalent oral polio vaccine]. NIDs are planned for late November [2013]. Additional case response SIAs are also planned targeting the newly infected areas of Punjab.

Chad, Cameroon, and Central African Republic
------------------------------------
- In Chad, no new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The most recent WPV case had onset of paralysis on [14 Jun 2012] (WPV1 from Lac). No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 remains 4 (the most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [12 May 2013] from Ennedi). A nationwide immunization campaign was conducted [25-27 Oct 2013]. NIDs are planned for late November [2013].
- In Cameroon, a 2nd WPV1 case was reported in the past week from Foumbot, Ouest region, following the 1st WPV1 case reported from Ouest region with onset of paralysis on [19 Oct 2013]. Outbreak response is underway.
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week from Cameroon. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 remains 4. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [12 Aug 2013] (from Kolfata, Extreme-Nord Province.
- Central African Republic (CAR) continues to be at serious risk of re-infection due to proximity with Chad and Cameroon, ongoing insecurity and humanitarian crises, and destruction of the health infrastructure. To minimize the risk and consequences of potential re-infection, SNIDs were conducted on [30 Sep to 2 Oct 2013] and Child Health Days, including OPV vaccination, from [11-13 Nov 2013]. Further SNIDs are planned for December [2013] with dates and districts to be decided.

Horn of Africa
--------------
- No new WPV1 cases were reported from the Horn of Africa region in the past week.
- The total number of WPV cases (all WPV1) for 2013 in the Horn of Africa remains 201 (180 from Somalia, 14 from Kenya, and 6 from Ethiopia). The most recent WPV1 case in the region had onset of paralysis on [30 Sep 2013] (from Lower Shabelle, Somalia).
- Outbreak response activities continue across countries in the Horn of Africa. As a result of concerted outbreak response efforts, the impact of the response is beginning to be seen, as the number of newly-reported cases from Banadir, Somalia (the epicentre of the outbreak) has declined. At the same time, the quality of SIA [supplementary immunization activity] operations is improving, as more children are being reached, including in some inaccessible areas of south-central Somalia. However, more needs to be done, because as many as 500 000 children still remain inaccessible in parts of south-central Somalia Other areas of the Horn of Africa remain at risk of re-infection.
- NIDs were completed in Djibouti and Ethiopia alongside with SNIDs in Yemen in early October [2013]. In Somalia, nationwide immunization campaigns targeting all age groups were conducted [20-24 Oct 2013]. SNIDs in South Sudan targeting under 15 year olds were carried out [22-24 Oct 2013].
- NIDs are planned for mid-November [2013] in Ethiopia, Kenya, Sudan, Somalia, and South Sudan.

Israel and West Bank and Gaza
-----------------------------
- Although no case of paralytic polio has yet been reported, environmental surveillance suggests that WPV1 transmission, first detected in February 2013, continues in southern and parts of central Israel. WPV1-positive samples were detected also in West Bank (2 sites) and the Gaza Strip (1 site). The most recent lab results show the 1st WPV1-negative results from a southern sampling site (Beer Sheva), which has so far been persistently WPV1-positive.
- Since 2005, only inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) has been used for routine childhood immunization in Israel. To interrupt WPV1 transmission, a nationwide SIA with bivalent OPV targeting children less than 10 years of age has been conducted during August and September [2013].
- Following a consultation with the country's immunization advisory group, the Israeli Ministry of Health has recently decided to re-introduce OPV into the national immunization schedule.
- SIAs in West Bank and Gaza Strip have been tentatively scheduled for November and December [2013].

Syrian Arab Republic
--------------------
- 3 new WPV1 cases were reported from Deir-Al-Zour governorate in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for Syria in 2013 is now 13, all from Deir-Al-Zour. Wild poliovirus was last reported in Syria in 1999.
- A comprehensive outbreak response continues to be implemented in Syria and across the sub-region. On [24 Oct 2013], an already-planned large-scale supplementary immunization activity was launched in the Syrian Arab Republic to vaccinate 1.6 million children against polio, measles, mumps and rubella, in both government-controlled and contested areas.
- Implementation of a supplementary immunization campaign in Deir-Al-Zour province commenced promptly when the first 'hot' acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases were reported.
- Larger-scale outbreak response SIAs across the Syrian Arab Republic and neighbouring countries will continue for at least 6-8 months depending on the area and based on the evolving epidemiological situation. The main aim is to rapidly reach children in the immediately-affected and other high-risk areas, followed by wider-scale immunization campaigns across the region targeting 22 million children over the next 6 months.

West Africa
-----------
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The most recent case in the region was a WPV1 from Tahoua province in Niger with onset of paralysis on [15 Nov 2012].
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week from Niger. The country has reported a single case of cVDPV in 2013, with onset of paralysis on [11 Jul 2013]. Genetic sequencing has shown that the virus is related to that seen in Cameroon, Chad, and Nigeria (Borno).
- Multi-country synchronized immunization campaigns were conducted in West Africa [25-28 Oct 2013]. Additional subnational campaigns are planned in the region for late November [2013].

[In an earlier ProMED-mail post (Poliomyelitis - update (22): South Sudan, global 20130930.1976296), there was mention of 3 cases of WPV confirmed in South Sudan. Since then, the information has been retracted due to "laboratory error" (see http://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan-republic/south-sudan-polio-outbreak-dref-operation-n%C2%B0-mdrss002-update-n%C2%B01 and http://www.nathnac.org/pro/clinical_updates/wildpoliosouthsudan051113.htm for more details.)

Since 23 Oct 2013, there has been an increase from 301 to 334 cases of which 16 occurred in endemic countries -- 13 of them in Pakistan -- and 17 occurred in non-endemic countries -- 13 of them in Syria. Of note is the information on the genetic sequencing of the WPV isolate associated with the ongoing outbreak in Syria -- closely related to the WPV isolated in Egypt, which in turn is related to a virus circulating in Pakistan.
