New strain of swine flu detected
--------------------------------
The Heath Ministry has quoted sources from the Ho Chi Minh City Pasteur Institute confirming that a new kind of porcine A/H3N1 influenza virus has appeared, apparently a combination [reassortant ?] of the swine-related A/H1N1 influenza virus and the A/H3N2 influenza virus. The medical sector has monitored 10 patients infected with [a] A/H3N2 influenza virus of porcine origin, and found that 3 of them had not had direct contact with any diseased pigs. Therefore, the sector has not ruled out the possibility of a mutation in the [porcine] A/H3N2 strain which could lead to transmission between humans, instead of strictly from pigs to humans as previously.

However, the situation has not reached an alarming level because the virus has not changed much; it has low toxicity and has shown no sign of drug resistance. Flu vaccines are able to cope with small changes in this kind of virus, said Le Hoang San, Vice Director of the HCMC Pasteur Institute.

[It is difficult to evaluate this report on the basis of the information provided. The 1st paragraph suggests that the agent is an H3N1 reassortant virus, but later it is described as a mutant of a swine H3N2 virus endowed with transmissibility in humans. Pending clarification, this report should be ignored. - Mod.CP]

[More information from knowledgeable sources would be greatly appreciated.
