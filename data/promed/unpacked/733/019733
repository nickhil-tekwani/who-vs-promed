A report about anthrax in sheep appeared in the local newspaper Eenadu on 9 Sep 2013. Briefly, 8 sheep died due to anthrax in Kesaram Village Nalgonda district of Andhra Pradesh [AP], India. However, unofficial reports from the farmers put the number of animals that died due to anthrax at 38.

Comments from the contributor: Andhra Pradesh is endemic for anthrax. During the last 20 years anthrax has been reported from almost all the districts of Andhra Pradesh (see http://nadres.res.in/Nadres_Uploads/UploadedFiles//VetEpiReports/SecondSlot/Tech%20Anthrax%20final.pdf). Sheep flocks in Andhra Pradesh are nomadic in nature and they migrate hundreds of miles every season in search of fodder.

In India, beef (cattle and buffalo) consumption is very much less when compared to the consumption of mutton (sheep and goats). Hence, the risk of transmission of the disease to humans from sheep meat and hides is very high. Furthermore, the disease is seen in peracute form in sheep in AP and animals die within hours of showing symptoms, thereby greatly increasing the chances of the infected animal meat entering into the food chain.

[Our heartfelt thanks to Dr Rao for this insightful report. I just wish we had more members like him on the ground and reporting events as they see them. Thank you.

If you view the maps in the national report quoted by Dr Rao, the state of Andhra Pradesh hits one in the eye for the reported severity of this disease there. In 2005 there were 39 outbreaks involving ruminants, 2006 (46 outbreaks), 2007 (54), 2008 (25), 2009 (13), 2010 (13), 2011 (6), and 2012 (2). Reports of human cases are variable but there were 65 human cases in 2009 with 17 deaths. It is not a minor problem.
