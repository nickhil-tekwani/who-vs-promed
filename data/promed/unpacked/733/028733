Foot and Mouth disease in Turkey
------------------------------
1. Disease report
Turkey has reported an outbreak of FMD serotype O in cattle in
Malatya region to the European Commission Animal Disease Notification
System (ADNS) on 22 Jan 2010. FMD is considered to be endemic in Turkey.

Disease control measures, including surveillance and vaccination
where appropriate, are in place.

2. Situation Assessment
With regard to the FMD situation in the region, the exact serotype
and sequence of the strain involved in this event is not known at
present. Turkey sends samples for FMD to the World Reference
Laboratory (WRL) for FMD (IAH Pirbright) for sequencing. In March
2009, laboratory testing suggested the presence of the FMD strain O
ME-SA Pan Asia-2, with close sequence similarity to strains from Iran
and Pakistan. Similarly in 2009, virus isolates of FMD O ME-SA Pan
Asia-2 have been reported from Saudi Arabia and Israel. FMD serotypes
A Iran 05 ARD-07, A Iran 05 EZM-07 and A Iran 05 BAR-08 are also
circulating in the region at present (WRL FMD, 2009).
