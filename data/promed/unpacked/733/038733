The smuggling of exotic and migratory birds worries federal authorities.
These birds, most destined for American pet stores, can spread fatal
diseases once reaching otherwise healthy bird populations.
"The threat to the American poultry industry is very real," federal
prosecutor Anne Perry said. In several cases in 1999, birds caught at the
border were infected with Newcastle disease, an airborne virus that can
spread quickly and wipe out whole poultry farms in weeks.
Devastating Newcastle disease outbreaks occurred in California and Florida
in the 1970s and cost more than $70 million to contain, said Jon Grice, a
USDA quarantine enforcement inspector. In 1971, an outbreak that spread
across Southern California was linked to a parrot from Paraguay. Another
epidemic in 1974 that reached 40 states and Puerto Rico was traced to pet
birds in San Diego and Virginia.
The smuggled birds can also carry avian influenza, which almost destroyed
Pennsylvania's poultry industry in the early 1980s, Grice said.
These diseases can occur in any bird populations, but strict quarantines are
imposed at the border in an attempt to keep infected birds out of the
country, he said. That makes legal importation of birds very expensive and
smuggling lucrative because cheaper birds can be sold on the black market.
Even then, some large parrots can go for as much as $1200, Perry said.
Smugglers generally buy the birds on the street in Mexico and try to sneak
them into the United States, she said.
One to 2 cases a year, involving 5 or 6 birds, are typical, Perry said. But
this year, there have already been 9 cases involving 40 birds, Perry said.
Recently, 10 baby Amazon parrots, so young they were nearly featherless,
were found in a cloth bag under the seat of a car trying to cross into the
United States. They were stitched in the bag tightly to muffle their sounds,
but the U.S. Customs Service found them when searching the car.
The birds were not infected, but 5 have died in quarantine, she said.
In other cases this year, brightly colored migratory birds such as the
painted buntings, black-throated magpie jays, sand blast jays and cardinals
were found stuffed into car compartments or hidden in clothing, Perry said.
These birds are protected by a migratory bird treaty and it is illegal to
capture, kill or own one, she said. It is even illegal to own a feather of a
migratory bird without a permit. Grice said migratory birds captured from
smugglers are either returned to their native countries or placed in bird
sanctuaries, where they are rehabilitated and released into the wild, if
possible.
