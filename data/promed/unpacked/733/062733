[Again this week, this outbreak continues to spread, involving a large
number of new farms. This week there are 74 new farms in 7 districts
involving well over 1000 cattle and almost 1000 sheep. By
comparison, last week's update contained data implicating 55 new farms
involving about the same number of sheep but only slightly more than
500 cattle. However, comparisons of weekly reports like this one are
not completely appropriate because of the differing lengths of
reporting periods. However, the comparison does serve to clearly show
us that the outbreak is not receding. I suspect this outbreak will
likely only be contained when the first solid frosts of the season
occur, which serves to remind us that this disease is clearly
climate-related. - Mod.PC]
