The [Washington State] Department of Health says 9 confirmed cases of
_E. coli_ [O157:H7] infection found in north Thurston and south
Pierce counties have been traced to bagged, commercial romaine
lettuce.

The Health Department says 4 cases were identified in Thurston County
and 6 in Pierce County. Some of the people infected were
hospitalized. Health department officials are interviewing the
victims.

"This particular strain is not very rare. It's a common one. We see
it fairly often. The thing that's unusual about this is having
several of the same strain all happening at the same time," said Don
Moyer, health department spokesperson.

The people who got sick all had salad or lettuce at different places,
which means all of those places probably got their lettuce from a
single source.

As health officials work to track down that source, there is good
news. All of the incidents happened in May 2008 and it has been more
than a week since the last one. Lettuce has a short shelf life, so
the contaminated lettuce was probably out of the food chain by the
time the cases were reported.

Salad products are often contaminated in the field and bagged product
comes from a large amount of plants as compared to just one plant if
the product is bought in its original form. Cattle are the animals
most frequently identified as a source of _E. coli_ O157:H7, although
other livestock may also carry the bacterium. In a recent report, _E.
coli_ O157:H7 was isolated from livestock at 31 of 32 fairs,
including 11.4 percent of 1407 cattle, 1.2 percent of 1102 swine, 3.6
percent of 364 sheep and goats, and 5.2 percent of 154 fly pools.
Cattle, swine, and flies at some fairs shared indistinguishable
O157:H7 isolate subtypes (Keen JE, Wittum TE, Dunn JR, et al:
