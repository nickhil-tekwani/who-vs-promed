Inland death blamed on melon
----------------------------
Imported cantaloupes contaminated with a rare strain of _Salmonella_
bacteria killed a 78-year-old Riverside woman and sickened nearly 30 other
people from California to New York, California health officials said
Tuesday. Authorities declined to provide many details about the woman,
other than that she was a nursing home patient who became ill 7 Apr 2001
and died two days later at a Riverside hospital.
At least 17 California residents became ill between April 6 Apr 2001 and 24
Apr 2001
after eating contaminated cantaloupe purchased in supermarkets or served in
restaurants, according to the state Department of Health Services.
Most of those sickened were from Southern California, including three from
Riverside County and two from San Bernardino County. One Riverside County
victim was a 2-year-old child, said Barbara Cole, who heads Riverside
County's disease control program. Contaminated cantaloupes sickened 13
other people in Arizona, Missouri, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Tennessee
and Washington.
California health officials have not yet confirmed exactly where the
contaminated produce came from but are "fairly certain this is an imported
product," said Jeff Farrar, head of a state health department emergency
response team.
At the time of the outbreak, he said, farms in California and Arizona had
not yet shipped cantaloupes, and Texas growers had only begun shipping
fruit. More domestic fruit is now reaching supermarkets, he said.
_Salmonella_ is the most frequently reported cause of food-borne illnesses,
and poultry, meat, eggs and dairy products are the most common sources of
the bacteria, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. The bacteria also can be found on fruits and vegetables,
particularly those grown or harvested on the ground and eaten raw.
Riverside and San Bernardino counties each report about 150 to 250 cases
[of salmonellosis a year, although in most cases the victims recover.
Consumers should wash their hands both before and after preparing foods,
and should rinse fruits and vegetables under running water to remove
bacteria, state and local health officials said. Consumers also should
promptly refrigerate any unused portions.
People stricken with the bacteria develop symptoms such as fever, abdominal
cramps and diarrhea within 3 days of eating contaminated foods. Most people
recover within 5 days without medical attention. But for children, the
elderly and those with weakened immune systems, the illness can be
life-threatening.
There are more than 2400 different strains of _Salmonella_ bacteria, said
Kim Woods, an epidemiologist with San Bernardino County's public health
department. Most strains are rare. The _Salmonella poona_ strain, which
caused this outbreak, is among those rare strains. It has been implicated
in food-borne illnesses in the past, Farrar said.
Last year, cantaloupes contaminated with _Salmonella poona_ sickened 46
people, including 26 in California. And in 1991, more than 400 people in 23
states and Canada became ill from the bacterium whose source was reported to
be cantaloupes grown in the Rio Grande Valley region along the Texas-Mexico
border.

[The outbreak from last year cited above was reported on ProMED-mail almost
exactly one year ago. We did not receive information about the source of
fruit responsible for last year's outbreak. It seems possible that the
regional harvest seasons for cantaloupes will provide a clue as to the
source of the current outbreak. Follow-up reports with source information
for either year would be welcome. - Mod.ES
