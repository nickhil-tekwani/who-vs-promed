Melamine-contaminated powdered infant formula in China [18 Sep 2008]
--------------------------------------------------------------------
More than 6240 cases of kidney stones in infants
with 3 deaths have been reported from across
China as of 17 Sep 2008. Kidney stones in infants
are very rare. The Ministry of Health of China
has confirmed that these cases are related to
melamine-contaminated powdered infant formula
consumed by the infants. While the exact onset
date of illness resulting from contamination is
unknown, a manufacturer received a complaint of illness in March 2008.

Following inspections conducted by China's
national inspection agency, at least 22 dairy
manufacturers across the country were found to
have melamine in some of their products (levels
varied between 0.09mg/kg and 2.560 mg/kg). Two
companies exported their products to Bangladesh,
Burundi, Myanmar, Gabon and Yemen. While
contamination in those exported products remains
unconfirmed, a recall has been ordered from China.

A recall is also ongoing for all contaminated products in China.

The World Health Organization (WHO) is in close
communication with the Ministry of Health of
China to monitor the situation. The WHO has also
been disseminating information on the situation
to WHO Member States through the International
Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN).
INFOSAN has also specifically alerted the 5
countries importing potentially contaminated products from China.

The WHO recommends breastfeeding as the ideal way
of providing young infants with the nutrients
they need for healthy growth and development.
Exclusive breastfeeding is recommended up to 6 months of age.

[2] Hong Kong recall dairy products, international recall infant milk

Chinese dairy contamination scandal grows
-----------------------------------------
Hong Kong ordered the recall of a Chinese
company's products on Thursday [18 Sep 2008]
after tests found 8 out of 30 of its dairy
offerings, including milk, ice cream and yoghurt,
were contaminated with melamine -- an organic
base usually found in plastics and resins, and
banned in food. The tests by Hong Kong's food
safety watchdog are the 1st verification by an
independent food safety watchdog that the
melamine contamination health scandal had now
spread to such a large range of other dairy products.

Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group Co Ltd is
one of 22 Chinese firms implicated in China's
growing milk-powder contamination scandal. Milk
powder containing melamine has killed 4 infants
in China and made more than 6000 ill. The company
was a Beijing Olympic games sponsor.

"We are recalling the Yili products, and the
importer is also recalling all Yili products,"
said Constance Chan, the controller of Hong
Kong's Centre for Food Safety, after the latest
round of test results of 30 samples of milk products.

Pet-food scandal
----------------
"That would involve milk, milk beverages,
yoghurt, ice cream and ice bar," she added. "8
out of 30 products of Yili company contain melamine."

The announcement by the Hong Kong authorities
could prove an embarrassment for China, which has
so far failed to identify melamine contamination
in dairy products other than milk powder. Last
year [2007] domestic animals in the US died as a
result of eating pet food imported from China, also contaminated by melamine.

There were reports at the time of the pet food
scandal that Chinese factory owners had been
adding melamine to their products to boost
nitrogen content, and so make it appear that they
contain more protein that they actually do. This
practice was banned last year [2007].

Hong Kong authorities said they would now
systematically test all other China-produced
dairy products made by other Chinese brands
before deciding if further recalls might be necessary.

Export worries
--------------
"In the next few days, we will test all other
mainland Chinese (dairy) products," Chan added.
"Any Chinese milk powder no matter where it is
made on the mainland, will be tested."

Meanwhile China tried to calm jitters about
exports of tainted baby milk powder to 5 poor
developing nations, saying no problems had been
reported so far and that the government was
working hard to address the issue. The government
has already announced that 5 countries ­ Yemen,
Bangladesh, Myanmar, Gabon and Burundi -- have
imported milk powder made by 2 Chinese firms
whose products were found to be contaminated.

"Though there has been no bad reaction, the
quality watchdog has demanded that these
companies take action to recall the products,"
said Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Jiang Yu.

HK and Seoul act on China baby milk worries
-------------------------------------------
China's tainted infant formula scandal yesterday
spread beyond the country's borders as food
safety officials in South Korea and Hong Kong
said they would investigate or recall Chinese
products. The Chinese government, which is
scrambling to reduce damage to the image of "Made
in China," announced more arrests in connection
with the milk powder crisis, which claimed its 4th victim yesterday.

Hong Kong ordered the recall of dairy products
including milk, ice-cream and yogurt made by
Yili, one of China's biggest dairy groups and an
official sponsor of the Beijing Olympics. Hong
Kong's food safety watchdog said 8 out of 30 Yili
products had failed a test for contamination with
melamine, a chemical that can boost the apparent
protein content of milk diluted with water.
Shares in Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group
tumbled by the 10 percent daily maximum for a 2nd straight day.

South Korea's food protection agency said it
would test whether processed foods from China
contained poisonous chemicals. The Korea Food and
Drug Administration said it had collected samples
of 615 imported Chinese products that might
contain tainted milk powder, the Yonhap news
agency said. The Chinese government has said milk
powder was exported by Yili and Sanlu, the 1st
company whose products were cited for melamine
contamination, only to Yemen, Bangladesh, Burma, Gabon and Burundi.

"Though there has been no bad reaction, the
quality watchdog has demanded that [Yili and
Sanlu] take action to recall the products," the
Chinese foreign ministry said yesterday [18 Sep 2008].

The government's product safety watchdog website
said tests on livestock feed would be stepped up
to prevent the use of melamine. Meanwhile worried
parents continued to bring infants to hospitals
across the country to have them tested for kidney
stones, which can be caused by melamine contamination.

At Shanghai Children's Hospital yesterday, nurses
said they had tested more than 200 children. One
worried mother said her 18-month-old daughter had
fallen ill after drinking one of the brands of
milk powder on a government list of those failing a safety test.

The Chinese government said on Wednesday that
6000 more children had fallen ill after being fed
tainted milk powder. Melamine-contaminated pet
food from China was blamed last year [2007] for
the deaths of thousands of pets in the US.

[4] Singapore, EU responses

Singapore bans China dairy imports, EU wants answers
----------------------------------------------------
Singapore banned all dairy imports from China on
Friday [19 Sep 2008] and the European Union
demanded answers from Beijing as the baby formula
scandal that has left thousands of infants ill
across China spread to liquid milk. A government
food quality watchdog in China said nearly 10
percent of milk and drinking yoghurt samples from
3 major dairy companies were contaminated with potentially deadly melamine.

Panicked parents have crowded hospitals and
demanded redress since officials and the Sanlu
Group, China's biggest maker of infant milk
powder, said last week that babies were sick with
kidney stones and complications after drinking
toxic milk powder. At the latest count, 6244
children have become ill. A total of 4 have died
and 158 are suffering "acute kidney failure." The
tide of sick children is overwhelming some
doctors, the official Xinhua agency said, quoting
a man who was turned away by hospitals in his hometown.

Singapore said on Friday [19 Sep 2008] it had
banned the import and sale of all milk and dairy
products from China after tests found melamine
contamination in 2 brands of China-made milk
products. Beijing has already recalled some milk
powder exported by 2 firms whose products were
found to be contaminated, and although it said
"there has been no bad reaction" to those goods,
many countries are fretting about their citizens' health.

On Thursday [18 Sep 2008], Hong Kong recalled
dairy products of one Chinese company.

Robert Madelin, director-general for health and
consumer protection at the European Commission,
said the European Union did not import Chinese
infant milk powder and there had been no EU
reports of illness from other imported Chinese
dairy products. But with foreign consumers
watching China again struggle with toxic food and
claims of delays and cover-ups, Madelin told
reporters in Beijing he expected an account of what went wrong.

"We are trying to establish the facts," Madelin
said. "On the governance aspects, we are also
asking questions, and we will learn the truth
probably about the same time you do."

After a nationwide check, China's General
Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection
and Quarantine named two of China's top dairy
producers, Xinhua news agency has reported.
Almost one-tenth of liquid milk and yoghurt
batches from Mengniu Dairy and Inner Mongolia
Yili Industrial Group Co Ltd contained melamine,
which is banned in food. Several samples of milk
from the Bright dairy group also had the
substance. Used in making plastics, melamine is
rich in nitrogen, an element often used to
measure protein levels. By adding melamine to
watered-down milk, dealers can fool quality checks.

Starbucks
---------
Starbucks Corp said its 300-plus cafes in
mainland China had pulled milk supplied by
Mengniu. Starbucks said no employees or customers had fallen ill from the milk.

Yili, a Beijing Olympic Games sponsor, already
faced a recall in Hong Kong, where authorities
found 8 of its 30 products, including ice-cream
and yoghurt ice bars, contained melamine. Mengniu
and Yili apologised to shaken consumers and
investors and vowed to recall and destroy problem products.

"Anyone who must step down will step down, anyone
who must bear legal responsibility will bear
legal responsibility," Yao Tongshan, Mengniu
executive director and chief financial officer,
told reporters in Hong Kong, where the company is listed.

Quality officials stressed that most Chinese milk
was safe, trying to shore up public trust already
shaken by a litany of food scares involving eggs,
pork and seafood in recent years. The Chinese
quality watchdog also said melamine-tainted milk
would not make adults sick unless they drank more
than 2 litres a day. But consumers sounded far from reassured.

China launched reforms to clean up food and
product safety after a wave of scandals last year
[2007], including melamine found in pet food
ingredients sent to the United States. It has
again vowed to punish errant businesses and
officials and there have already been dismissals
and detentions linked to Sanlu, 43 percent owned
by New Zealand dairy giant Fonterra.

[5] Subscriber observation -- prior melamine pet food contamination
Date: 18 Sep 2008
From: Tony Ross
<tonyross@illinois.edu>


The 2007 petfood contamination in the USA
associated with melamine had an additional twist
to its pathogenesis. Melamine is not particularly
toxic to cats and dogs. Neither is cyanuric acid.
But put them together in contaminated petfood and
you get a nephrotoxic crystaluria which killed large numbers of cats and dogs.

A similar large incident occured in 2004
affecting cats and dogs in several Asian
countries. It would be interesting to know
whether the current infant urolith [kidney
stones] problem is due to the melamine-cyanuric acid polymer or melamine alone.

<tonyross@illinois.edu>

[The numbers of affected infants (6244) have not
changed since yesterday's posting, but there has
been a report of an additional death attributable
to the melamine contamination of baby milk powder
in China, bringing the total of fatalities up to 4.

From the above newswires and reports, it appears
as though there has been international
distribution of melamine contaminated dairy
products. While the Chinese authorities have
stated that the implicated contaminated baby milk
powder has been distributed to only 5 countries
(Yemen, Bangladesh, Burma, Gabon and Burundi),
testing of other dairy products including yoghurt
and ice-cream exported to Hong Kong and Singapore
have identified the presence of melamine in these
products. Other countries are now beginning to
test dairy products imported from China to see if
these products are also contaminated with melamine.

The list of countries known to have imported baby
milk products from producers with documented
melamine contamination includes 5 developing
countries with limited resources, reduced public
health infrastructures and limitations in access
of the general population to secondary and
tertiary medical care. Identification of infants
with renal problems related to the ingestion of
melamine contaminated milk products may be
challenged in some of these countries. This
moderator attempted to find information on the
coverage of breastfeeding in the 5 mentioned
countries, to attempt an estimate on the possible
number of infants and young children potentially
at risk (those not presently being breastfed and
those being supplemented by infant
formula/powder), but unfortunately the database
on the WHO website is currently under revision (see
<http://www.who.int/nutrition/databases/infantfeeding/en/index.html>)

In part [4] above, Dr. Ross raises some
interesting observations. ProMED-mail did not
cover a similar incident in 2004, and would like
to thank Dr. Ross for bringing this to our
attention. In a probably related incident in
China, on 22 Feb 2006, Xinhua reported at least
38 cats dying shortly after being fed with
Xiduoyu, a brand of a "Tianjin-based cat food
manufacturer." A veterinarian referred to in the
story said "test results from Beijing Animal
Hospital showed the dead cats had suffered from
kidney exhaustion and that the sick ones have
kidney damage." Suspicions at that time focused
on lead poisoning though Gu Junhua, a chief
engineer from China's "national feedstuff quality
check centre under the Ministry of Agriculture,"
was reported as saying: "But at present, he said
it was difficult to draw any conclusions because
the country has not drafted any food safety
criteria for pets in terms of the quality and
quantity of each element of the ingredients." No
mention of melamine was made in that article.
(<http://english.sina.com/china/1/2006/0221/66443.html>,
information gotten originally from Wikipedia
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_pet_food_recalls#cite_note-Xinhua_English-45>).
The Wikipedia site also had the following
information: "A 2004 outbreak involving pet foods
sickened more than 6000 dogs and a lesser number
of cats in Asia. Kidney failure in the animals
was linked to foods manufactured in Thailand by
Mars Inc. Veterinarians in Asia initially blamed
the 2004 problems on fungal toxins, but pathology
tests conducted in 2007 found melamine and
cyanuric acid present in renal tissue from both
outbreaks. According to pathologists: "These
results indicate that the pet food­associated
renal failure outbreaks in 2004 and 2007 share
identical clinical, histologic, and toxicologic
findings, providing compelling evidence that they
share the same causation." (articles referenced
included Brown CA et al. Outbreaks of renal
failure associated with melamine and cyanuric
acid in dogs and cats in 2004 and 2007. J Vet
Diagn Invest 19:525­531 (2007) -- full article available at
<http://jvdi.org/cgi/reprint/19/5/525>) and a USA Today newswire available at
<http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-03-10-petfood_N.htm>.
In the Brown CA et al study, the authors
identified melamine and cyanuric acid presnt in
renal tissue from both outbreaks and concluded
that "These results indicate that the pet food --
associated renal failure outbreaks in 2004 and
2007 share identical clinical, histologic, and
toxicologic findings, providing compelling
evidence that they share the same causation."
Hence, there is evidence that the use of melamine
to boost the apparent protein content of
nutritional products (in these cases pet food) dates back to at least 2004.

We await further information -- both in terms of
other countries identifying melamine
contamination of imported (or domestically
produced) milk products, and information on
possible affected infants in other countries. - Mod.MPP]
