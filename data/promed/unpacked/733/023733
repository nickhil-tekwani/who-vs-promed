Dengue Mosquito found in Chile for the first time
--------------------------------------------------
After a century [of having been eradicated], the mosquito responsible
for the spread of dengue and yellow fever has been detected again in
the continental area of Chile, a country traditionally proud of being
free of the 2 illnesses. Last week the Chilean national surveillance
program detected one female specimen of the feared mosquito _Aedes
aegypti_ in the Huasco province, located in the northern part of the
country.
The _Aedes aegypti_ is a domestic, day-biting mosquito that prefers
to feed on humans. If the mosquito carries one of the 4 types of
dengue virus, its bite can produce a spectrum of illnesses, including
severe and fatal hemorrhagic disease.
"This is the first observation of the insect in the area since its
eradication at the beginning of the twentieth century," Cecilia
Perret, director of the tropical diseases laboratory at the Catholic
University, told Reuters Health. She added that Chile [had been] the
only country in South and Central America free of the presence of the
_Aedes aegypti_. "With the new detection, we can say that all the
American countries face the threat of _Aedes aegypti_," Perret said.
In North America, the mosquito is found in south Texas, the
southeastern U.S., and in parts of Mexico, according to a U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey conducted in 1997.
The first Chilean cases of dengue were detected in 2002, but in a
remote place far from the continent: Easter Island. In that outbreak,
there were 672 patients in a period of just 4 months, equivalent to
20 percent of the entire population of the island. The Chilean
authorities said that despite the presence of the mosquito in the
Huasco Province, there are still no reports of patients with dengue.
To prevent the viral infection, they launched a sanitary campaign
that includes the fumigation of houses and buildings.
"We are asking the people to collaborate on the elimination of the
mosquito, which is our main task today," Yasna Provoste, head of the
regional government, said.
The National Office of Emergencies is distributing water in the
Huasco province, which is known for its dryness. Due to the scarcity
of water, the villagers usually store it in containers that can
facilitate the reproduction of the mosquito. Mosquitoes typically
breed in standing water, including rain water that collects in old
tires or containers.

[The first case of dengue fever in Chile infected with dengue virus
type 1 was diagnosed at Easter Island in February 2002. At that time
_Aedes aegypti_ had not been identified in mainland Chile. The
identification of _Aedes aegypti_ in Chile shows the risk of spread
into Chile not only of dengue virus, but yellow fever as well. -
