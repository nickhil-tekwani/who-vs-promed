A Comment on West Nile Virus Diagnosis in Wildlife
--------------------------------------------------
I am writing in response to the posting on supposed West Nile virus
infection in raptors [see: West Nile virus, raptors - USA (02) 20020925.5401].
I am a veterinarian on Long Island, NY, and I treat wildlife, including
raptors, on a regular basis. I would like to agree with the moderator's
word of caution about "circumstantial evidence" being used to "diagnose"
West Nile virus infection. Regardless of how certain anyone feels about the
causes of disease and death in the raptors they are treating, my
understanding from Dr. Ward Stone, State Wildlife Pathologist here in NY,
is that many (most?) neurologic birds submitted for pathology are actually
dead from pesticide toxicity. I have seen more neurologic raptors
(Red-tailed Hawks and one Merlin) in the past few weeks as well, all
emaciated and moribund. West Nile virus infection is certainly on the
differential list, but I would never presume to diagnose the disease from
the general neurologic signs noted. It would be tragic if there were even
more avian pesticide deaths as a result of such conjecture. Hopefully Dr.
Stone's lab and the National Wildlife Pathology Lab will be able to provide
diagnoses, not suppositions, regarding these recent raptor deaths.

Some Issues to Consider with Raptors, Mortalities, and West Nile Virus
---------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Both raptors and crows are susceptible to Eastern equine encephalitis
virus (EEEV) as well as West Nile virus (WNV); (Am J Trop Med Hyg 66(4),
2002, 422-426). We have observed EEEV in raptors since surveillance for
these arbovirus has increased.
(2) We have reported WNV in a raptor in the winter months (January in New
England); (J Clin Micro 38(8), 2000, 3110-3111). Raptor mortalities may
continue past the mosquito season. The mode of transmission is at issue
(i.e., ingesting of prey, reservoir host, etc.).
(3) The role of ectoparasites in transmission of WNV in birds (hippoboscid
flies have tested WNV positive) is worthy of exploration.
(4) The USGS National Wildlife Health Center's approach is excellent.
Raptor mortalities need to be fully assessed, not just tested for WNV.
Approximately 80 percent of the raptors we have received since WNV hit
Connecticut in 1999 have not tested positive for WNV. We have observed
trauma, mycotic disease (Aspergillosis), parasitic disease (primarily
protozoan), bacterial disease (_Mycobacterium_ and _Salmonella_...), and
our favorite: no significant lesions.
