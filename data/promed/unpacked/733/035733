Two horses in Suwannee County, [Florida], have tested positive for Eastern Equine Encephalitis, also known as [EEE]. The Florida Department of Health in Suwannee County is letting residents know that there is an increase in mosquito-borne diseases in the area. To protect yourself from mosquitoes, you should remember to "Drain and Cover":

Drain standing water to stop mosquitoes from multiplying.
- Drain water from garbage cans, house gutters, buckets, pool covers, coolers, toys, flower pots, or any other containers where sprinkler or rain water has collected.
- Discard old tires, drums, bottles, cans, pots and pans, broken appliances, and other items that aren't being used.
- Empty and clean birdbaths and pets' water bowls at least once or twice a week.
- Protect boats and vehicles from rain with tarps that don't accumulate water.
- Maintain swimming pools in good condition with appropriate chlorination. Empty plastic swimming pools when not in use.

Cover skin with clothing or repellent.
- Clothing: Wear shoes, socks, and long pants and long-sleeves. This type of protection may be necessary for people who must work in areas where mosquitoes are present.
- Repellent: Apply mosquito repellent to bare skin and clothing. Always use repellents according to the label. Repellents with DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, para-menthane-diol, and IR3535 are effective.
- Use mosquito netting to protect children younger than 2 months old.

Cover doors and windows with screens to keep mosquitoes out of your house.
- Repair broken screening on windows, doors, porches, and patios.

The Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported [Tue 3 Jul 2018] that the Florida Department of Agriculture confirmed 14 cases of Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in June [2018], as follows:

A viral disease, EEE affects the central nervous system and is transmitted to horses by infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs of EEE include moderate to high fever, depression, lack of appetite, cranial nerve deficits (facial paralysis, tongue weakness, difficulty swallowing), behavioral changes (aggression, self-mutilation, or drowsiness), gait abnormalities, or severe central-nervous-system signs, such as head-pressing, circling, blindness, and seizures. The course of EEE can be swift, with death occurring 2-3 days after onset of clinical signs despite intensive care; fatality rates reach 75-80 percent among horses. Horses that survive might have long-lasting impairments and neurologic problems.

Vaccines have proven to be a very effective EEE prevention tool. Horses that have been vaccinated in past years will need an annual booster shot; in areas with a prolonged mosquito season, veterinarians might recommend 2 boosters annually: one in the spring and another in the fall. However, if an owner did not vaccinate the animal in previous years, the horse will need the 2-shot vaccination series within a 3-6-week period.

In addition to vaccinations, horse owners also need to reduce the mosquito populations and their possible breeding areas. Recommendations include removing stagnant water sources, keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, which are typically early in the morning and evening, and applying mosquito repellents approved for equine use.

[These 2 articles really illustrate how active the mosquito season is in Florida. They should also emphasize how many people are not keeping their horses up-to-date on the vaccinations that are capable of saving the animal's life and reducing anxiety and frustration for the owner. The vaccine for EEE is usually combined with WEE (Western equine encephalitis) and WNV (West Nile virus) and tetanus. In the small amount of time it takes, the injection provides a lot of protection for our horses. - Mod.TG
