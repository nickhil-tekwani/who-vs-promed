A candidate pandemic influenza virus?
-------------------------------------
The recent ProMED-mail posting entitled "Avian influenza, human (08): South
Korea 20070111.0119", which commented on the lack of virulence of the H5N1
influenza strains (so-called V genotype) that have infected up to 9 humans
in South Korea, is intriguing. Surely, more research effort should be put
into exploring this particular strain of H5N1, as this may be more typical
of a human-adapted pandemic influenza virus. The more lethal, widespread
H5N1 influenza virus (Z genotype) is less typical of previous pandemic
influenza viruses, which infected millions but with an overall relatively
low mortality of just a few percent or less, including the 1918 pandemic.
Do we know whether this South Korean V genotype virus is more transmissible
than the more lethal Z genotype or whether it is more or less likely to
develop neuraminidase inhibitor resistance? Could it be that the more
dramatically lethal Z genotype is attracting so much attention because of
its higher mortality in humans but that, ironically, the quieter, less
lethal V genotype is the more likely pandemic influenza virus candidate, if
one believes that H5N1 influenza is likely to be the next pandemic
influenza strain at all?
Some researchers believe that a variant of the human influenza viruses
(H3N2, H1N1, etc) already in existence are more likely to be the next
pandemic influenza strain than a new zoonotic strain, which has to jump the
species barrier and adapt to efficient infection and transmission between
humans. If H5N1 was on the way to becoming the next pandemic influenza
strain, I would be inclined to look for human cases like those in South
Korea, whose mild or asymptomatic clinical picture may well indicate a
successful adaptation to humans, suggesting the possibility of many humans
having been infected but with only a small percentage of deaths -- that is,
similar to the previous pandemic human influenza viruses.
