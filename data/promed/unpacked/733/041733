On Thursday [12 Jun 2014] a girl died of a hitherto unknown disease at El Salam camp for the displaced in Nyala locality, South Darfur.

Sheikh Mahjoub Adam Tabaldiya of El Salam camp told Radio Dabanga that [she] (12) [age in years?] died of an unidentified disease on Thursday [12 Jun 2014].

"More than 1000 camp residents have been infected within 4 days. The symptoms are high fever, diarrhea, vomiting, and coughing", the sheikh explained. "The 2 camp hospitals, which are serving 91 000 displaced, have been receiving 100 patients a day during the past few days."

Tabaldiya added that the health authorities have not identified the cause so far, and called on the authorities and humanitarian organisations to intervene "as soon as possible", contain the highly infectious disease, and provide treatment for the patients.

[The description of the disease (high fever, diarrhea, vomiting, and coughing) affecting about 1000 people in a camp for displaced persons in Darfur region of Sudan is too non-specific to propose a differential diagnosis. ProMED-mail would appreciate more detailed information about the clinical manifestations, time course of the illness, age, and sex distribution, etc. from knowledgeable sources.

Sudan is a country in the Nile Valley of North Africa. It is divided into 18 states or wilayat (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan). South Darfur, with an estimated population of approximately 2.89 million (2006), is one of the 5 states (Central, East, North, South, and West Darfur) that compose the Darfur region in western Sudan (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Darfur).

El Salam is a camp for displaced persons near the city of Nyala. Nyala has a population of 565 734 (2007) and is capital of South Darfur (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyala,_Sudan). For a map of Sudan showing the location of Nyala, see https://www.google.com/maps/@12.0521585,24.909482,6z. - Mod.ML]

[This is now the 3rd report of an undiagnosed outbreak in Sudan in the past two days (see Undiagnosed hemorrhagic fever - Sudan: (RS) RFI 20140617.2544937 and Undiagnosed illness - Sudan (RS): RFI 20140617.2544550). The other 2 reports deal with outbreaks in the Red Sea state, whereas this outbreak seems to be affecting residents in a displaced persons camp in South Darfur. - Mod.MPP
