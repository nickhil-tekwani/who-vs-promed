FOODBORNE DISEASE SURVEILLANCE - SPAIN (2)
==========================================
The Spanish equivalent of MMWR is Boletin Epidemiologico y Microbiologico
- available from the Spanish Ministry of Health.
The Boletin is well written, and we find it an excellent resource in
compiling our GIDEON software. Examples include recent typhoid fever data
(1,041 cases in 1992 and 676 in 1994); Salmonellosis outbreaks (485 in
1992 and 471 in 1993; S. enteritidis accounts for ca. 43% of isolates;
21% of isolates reported from Madrid, etc., etc.).
