[We had requested from Antti Vaheri an up-date on Puumala virus infections
in Finland. This hantavirus is the etiologic agent of nephropathia
epidemica, a milder form of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome than that
cuased by Hantaan virus. Antti and Olli Vapalahti were kind enough to send
the following update. - Mod.CHC]
RECORD HIGH INCIDENCE OF HANTAVIRUS INFECTIONS IN FINLAND IN 1999.
The year 1999 yielded a record number of hantavirus (Puumala virus; PUUV)
infections in Finland, with altogether 2270 serologically verified cases,
more than double the annual average (957). With a population of 5.2 million
in Finland, the average incidence for the whole country is 19/100 000,
while in 1999 this was 44/100 000. The mortality is less than 0.1%. The
high incidence of 1999 is due to the countrywide abundance of the carrier
rodent, _Clethrionomys glareolus_ (bank vole), which has in northernmost
Europe a (three to) four-year cyclicity with often two consecutive peak
years. However, usually different regions of Finland are in different
phases of this periodicity, one year epidemic occurring e.g. in the eastern
part and another year in the western part of the country. Exceptionally, in
1999 the bank vole populations were high all over the country; however, with
a population crash ahead in the east and another, even higher peak
forecasted for the west. The highest incidence, over 200, was recorded in
the Ita-Savo province of Eastern Finland. The bank vole populations are
highest in the autumn and early winter and lowest in the spring, and the
number of PUUV infections reflect this fluctuation.
