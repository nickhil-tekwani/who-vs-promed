re: PRO/EAFR. Foot & mouth disease - Nigeria (Taraba), bovine, new outbreak, RFI 20160604.4261429
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[Following the distribution, on 4 Jun 2016, of the above posting within ProMED-mail's regional network ProMED-EAFR (English language posts focusing on Anglophone Africa), we have received several responses from members of the Epicore Global Surveillance Project in Nigeria. We present here 3 of the responses, obtained from 2 Epicore members.

Subscribers are encouraged to refer to the PRO/EAFR posting at http://www.promedmail.org/post/4261429 and to the commentary below. - Mod.AS]

a. There are reported cases of foot and mouth disease [FMD] in Taraba State, Nigeria. Unconfirmed report supports that the nomadic nature of the herdsmen is making it difficult to tract the disease incidence and carry out immediate intervention. This is becoming a major threat as the disease may as well spread to neighboring states.

b. There is a recent reoccurrence of FMD in cattle grazing area of Fufore local government area (LGA) of Adamawa. This is according to the director of agriculture and veterinary services in the LGA Mr John Na'imu who raised the alarm during an interview with New Agency of Nigeria recently.

Outbreaks of FMD, occurring in different parts of Nigeria, have not been reported through official channels. This particular outbreak could be one of those cases not reported to the veterinary authorities. A field epidemiology officer from Taraba state is in the field investigating this outbreak. Unfortunately, besides the underreporting, suspected cases are not confirmed by the national laboratory.

[We are very grateful to the members of Epicore Global Surveillance Project in Nigeria who have responded to the request for information in the PRO/EAFR posting of 4 Jun 2016 [Foot & mouth disease - Nigeria (Taraba), bovine, new outbreak, RFI 20160604.4261429]. This posting included the following commentary by Mod.AB:

"The last official notification of FMD to OIE from the State of Taraba dates back to the year 2012, when 2 and 1 outbreaks were reported respectively in September and November. The virus was not typed. The detailed information on the outbreaks can be accessed at: http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statusdetail (select FMD, Nigeria, Jan-Dec 2012).

"Although notifications of this disease from Nigeria are sporadic, the country is part of the West and Central African zone where several FMD virus types circulate endemically.

"ProMED-EAFR would appreciate receiving more information on the reported outbreak(s): receptive animal population at risk, attack rate, control measures undertaken and possibly the identity of the associated virus sero/topo/genotype.

"Taraba State is bordered by the states of Benue, Nasarawa and Plateau west, Bauchi and Gombe north, and Adamawa east. It shares a border with Cameroon in the south. Taraba includes 16 local government areas including Sardauna https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taraba_State. A map showing the administrative subdivisions of Sardauna is available at: http://www.satellitecitymaps.com/africa-map/nigeria-map/taraba-state-map/sardauna-map/. - Mod.AB."

Additional information, addressing in detail the queries raised by Mod.AB, and in particular specifying the FMDV serotype involved, is awaited. - Mod.AS
