A _Salmonella_ outbreak at Great Moon Buffet in West St. Paul, MN has sickened 17 people, according to the Minnesota Department of Health. Three people were hospitalized. The illnesses are associated with meals purchased at the restaurant from 26 Jun 2021 to 28 Jun 2021 and some July [2021] visits to the restaurant. A particular food item has not yet been identified; the investigation is ongoing.

Thirteen of the illnesses are lab-confirmed cases of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Enteritidis. Four of the illnesses were reported from people who ate at the restaurant but weren't tested. After the illnesses were reported, health officials initiated interventions at Great Moon Buffet and the risk is no longer ongoing, according to the health department.

Symptoms of a _Salmonella_ infection include vomiting, fever, chills, nausea, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea that may be bloody. These symptoms usually develop within 6 to 72 hours of eating contaminated food and last about a week. Some people with _Salmonella_ infections develop long-term complications, including irritable bowel syndrome, reactive arthritis, and high blood pressure.

In Minnesota, about 800 cases of salmonellosis are reported each year. _Salmonella_ Enteritidis is the serotype most commonly identified with these illnesses.

Banerji S, Simon S, Tille A, et al: Genome-based _Salmonella_ serotyping as the new gold standard. Sci Rep. 2020; 10: 4333; https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-61254-1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Subtyping of bacterial enteric pathogens, such as _Salmonella enterica_, traditionally relies on serotyping. The species _Salmonella enterica_ is divided into 6 subspecies and consists of more than 2600 serotypes or serovars, which are classified according to the White-Kauffmann-Le Minor Scheme. Serotyping is based on determination of somatic O antigens and flagellin H antigens by reaction with specific antisera. Most _S. enterica_ serovars have 2 alternately expressed H antigens, also referred to as 'phases'. The phase-1 and phase-2 flagellin proteins are encoded by fliC and fljB, respectively. The phase switch is regulated by the invertase hin and the fliC repressor gene fljA2. Therefore, the specific antigenic formula consists of 3 positions: the 1st position represents the O antigens, the 2nd and 3rd positions the 2 different flagellin H antigens. Each antigen position is separated by a colon, i.e., O:H1:H2. The antigenic formula for _S._ Typhimurium for example is accordingly 1,4,[5],12:i:1,2. There are variants of _S._ Typhimurium which express only one flagellin and which therefore are referred to as monophasic _S._ Typhimurium. _S._ Enteritidis on the other hand does not possess a 2nd flagellin per se, which is reflected in the antigenic formula: 1,9,12:g,m:-. It should be noted that some serovars share the same antigenic formula and require additional testing for unambiguous identification, e.g., the clinically important serovar _S._ Chloeraesuis shares its antigenic formula 6,7:c:1,5 with serovars _S._ Paratyphi C and _S._ Typhisuis."

The source of the pathogen is being investigated. - Mod.LL
