Yellow fever mosquitoes capable of carrying dengue fever and other viral diseases have been found in Riverside and San Bernardino counties [California].

The tropical, non-native _Aedes aegypti_ was identified in Riverside on Friday, 2 Oct [2015]. Hundreds of the mosquitoes were found in San Bernardino County for the 1st time about a week earlier.

_Aedes aegypti_ can transmit possibly fatal dengue and yellow fevers, as well as chikungunya virus, to people. Severe dengue, which has no vaccine, can cause breathing problems and circulatory system failure. Yellow fever, for which there is a vaccine, can lead to jaundice and organ failure.

The aggressive, day-feeding mosquito is clearly distinguishable from the little brown mosquitoes native to the area. The black mosquito with a 2.7 mm average wingspan has striking white spots on its abdomen, white bands on its legs and white lines on its thorax, or mid-section between its head and abdomen, that resemble a lyre.

Dengue fever is endemic in northern Mexico, Northwest Mosquito and Vector Control District Vector Ecologist Michelle Brown said Wednesday [7 Oct 2015]. "There are lots of people who travel back and forth to Mexico. So there's a real concern about dengue being locally acquired," she said.

The find marks the 1st time these mosquitoes have been found in the county, said Riverside County Department of Environmental Health Program Chief Dottie Merki, who works in vector control.

No cases of dengue or chikungunya acquired in California have been reported, and the risk of those being transmitted in the region is low, according to Merki and a California Department of Public Health document. State public health department officials did not respond to a request for information. Yet people who travel to or from other countries could bring the viruses here, where the diseases can now be spread by mosquitoes able to transmit them when native mosquitoes can't, Merki added.

"We're always concerned when a species that's not endemic to the area shows up that can transmit a disease that is also not endemic to the area," she said.

_Aedes aegypti_ was found in California in 2013.

Mosquito abatement officials describe the insect as "elegant" and "beautiful." A San Bernardino County vector control technician was so taken with them she had one tattooed larger-than-life on her shoulder. However, abatement personnel take the tiny blood suckers very seriously. On Friday [2 Oct 2015], Brown's staff identified 3 by sight. They notified state health officials that day.

[_Aedes aegypti_ has been found at several locations in California in recent years. _Aedes albopictus_, also a dengue and chikungunya virus vector, has been found in California very recently as well.

Travelers who have been infected with dengue and chikungunya viruses arrive in California with some frequency. Should _Aedes albopictus_ and _Ae. aegypti_ populations become established, there is a real risk of ongoing transmission initiated by an incoming viremic individual. However, these viruses may not become endemic in southern California because of screens and air conditioning, and especially because of effective vector control that most areas in California have. However, the risk remains for sporadic introduction of these viruses with limited outbreaks.

As noted in previous comments, the counties in California where these mosquitoes have been found over the past 3 years illustrate 2 critical points; (1) the importance of ongoing surveillance to detect their presence very early on while they are still geographically limited, and (2) rapid response by vector control officials and the public. One hopes that the eradication efforts are successful.
