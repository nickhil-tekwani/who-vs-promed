The world of pets in Buenos Aires has 865 984 inhabitants, according
to the last census, which was carried out 4 years ago by the Luis
Pasteur Institute for Zoonoses. Dogs continue to be the most common
domestic animals. The latest information given out was that there
were 425 978 canines in the city, more than double the number of cats
in the city, at 206 710.

The Pasteur Institute explained that there are 2 types of rabies
[virus transmission], that which affects animals via an aerial cycle,
principally bats, and those that affect terrestrial species, such as
dogs and cats as well as humans. Although no terrestrial cycle cases
have been detected since 1981, in contrast, there have been reports
of people who have been bitten by bats which have been infected [with
rabies virus]. It has been estimated that 3 percent of bats are
infected [with rabies virus].

[ProMED thanks Dr. Freuler for sending in this report as a follow-up
to the earlier report of rabies in a cat in Buenos Aires (see ProMED
archive no. 20080505.1530). It would be important to know how many of
the dogs and cats in Rio de Janeiro have been immunized against
rabies. If bats there are infected, the risk of exposure of dogs and
cats, as well as humans, is real. This argues forcefully for
maintaining the dog and cat population immunized routinely. It would
be interesting to know which species of bats are infected with rabies
virus. One would expect the incidence and prevalence to vary
significantly by species. - Mod.TY]
