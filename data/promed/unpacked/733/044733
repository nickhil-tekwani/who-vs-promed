[H5N2 avian influenza viruses 1st appeared in chickens in Taiwan in 2003 and caused a series of outbreaks afterwards. Phylogenetic analyses show that the chicken H5N2 viruses have H5 and N2 genes that are closely related to those of a vaccine strain originating from Mexico in 1994, while the contemporary duck H5N2 viruses in Taiwan belong to the Eurasian gene pool. The unusually high similarity of the chicken H5N2 viruses to the Mexican vaccine strain suggests that these viruses might have been introduced to Taiwan by using inadequately inactivated or attenuated vaccines. These chicken H5N2 viruses are developing varying levels of pathogenicity that could lead to significant consequences for the local poultry industry [1].

There is no evidence of human-to-human spread of H5N2.

[At present, 3 different HPAI serotypes are known to circulate on Taiwan's territory, namely H5N2 (2 separate events), H5N3 and H5N8. Their respective epizootics are considered by the OIE as "continuing".

1. The HPAI H5N2 event which is dealt with in the above OIE follow-up report no. 32 reportedly started on 7 Jan 2015. So far, 533 outbreaks have been reported. The epidemiological comments on the OIE website, issued during an early stage of this event, provide the following information:

"Abnormal mortalities in 4 goose farms in Yun-Lin County and an acute egg drop syndrome in a layer duck farm in Ping-Tung County were noticed early January 2015. Local disease control center staff went to these farms to conduct movement restrictions and clinical inspection and then sent dead geese and layer ducks samples to the National Laboratory for diagnosis. Specific RNA product of avian influenza virus was detected and subtyped as H5N2 by RT-PCR. Highly pathogenic avian influenza strain was confirmed by the National Laboratory based on sequencing analysis of HA0 cleavage site. It is worth noting that H and N genes of these isolates are different from the H5N2 strains previously isolated in Taiwan. The homology of H5 between the isolates from these infected farms and the South Korea 2014 H5N8 strain is near 99 percent. The homology of N2 between the isolates from these infected farms and the China 2011 H5N2 strain is 96 percent. This H5N2 strain is obviously novel to Taiwan. All the geese and ducks on the infected farm will be culled. The actual number of culled geese and ducks will be available when stamping out will finish and be reported in the next follow-up report. Thorough cleaning and disinfection will be conducted after stamping out operation. Surrounding poultry farms within a 3 km radius of the infected farm are under intensified surveillance for 3 months."

2. The HPAI H5N8 event started 8 Jan 2015; as of 11 Aug 2015 (last available follow-up report, no. 19), a total of 296 outbreaks have been reported. The epidemiological comments on the OIE website, issued during an early stage of this event, provide the following information:

"Abnormal mortality was noticed and reported to the local disease control center by the owner of the breeding goose farm. Two dead geese were taken from the farm for diagnosis and the farm has been put under movement restrictions since then. Specific RNA product of avian influenza virus was detected and subtyped as H5N8 by RT-PCR. Highly pathogenic avian influenza was confirmed by the National Laboratory based on sequencing analysis of HA0 cleavage site. All the geese on the infected farm will be culled. The actual number of culled geese will be available when stamping out will finish and be reported in the next follow-up report. Thorough cleaning and disinfection will be conducted after stamping out operation. Surrounding poultry farms within a 3 km radius of the infected farm are under intensified surveillance for 3 months."

3. The HPAI H5N3 event started 11 Jan 2015; as of 26 Feb 2015 (last available follow-up report, no. 6), a total of 25 outbreaks have been reported. The epidemiological comments on the OIE website, issued during an early stage of this event, provide the following information:

"Abnormal mortalities were observed in 2 goose farms in Kao-Hsiung City and Ping-Tung County. Local disease control center staff went to these farms to conduct movement restrictions and clinical inspection. Dead geese were taken to the National Laboratory (Animal Health Research Institute, AHRI) for diagnosis. Specific RNA of avian influenza virus was detected and subtyped as H5N3 by RT-PCR. Highly pathogenic avian influenza was confirmed by the National Laboratory according to sequencing analysis of HA0 cleavage site. All the geese within the infected farms were destroyed or died. Thorough cleaning and disinfection will be conducted after stamping out operation. Surrounding poultry farms within 3 km radius of infected farms are under intensified surveillance for 3 months."

A 4th "event," caused by HPAI H5N2, relates to a single outbreak which reportedly started 6 Jan 2015, confirmed 9 Jan 2015 and notified to the OIE on 12 Jan 2015. Similar to the other 3 events, this one is sill regarded by the OIE as "continuing." The relevant epidemiological comments were:

"Upon request from central competent authority, local disease control center staff took samples from 3 dead chickens and sent them to the National Laboratory (Animal Health Research Institute, AHRI) on 6 Jan 2015. H5N2 subtype HPAI was detected and confirmed by the AHRI on 9 Jan 2015. When the staff went to the infected farm for investigation on 6 Jan 2015, the farm record indicated that there was an abnormal mortality mid December 2014. All the chickens within the infected farm have been put under movement restrictions and will be culled. The actual number of culled chickens will be reported in the next follow-up report. Thorough cleaning and disinfection will be conducted after stamping out operation. Surrounding poultry farms within a 3 km radius of the infected farm are under intensified surveillance for 3 months."

This 4th event remained limited to a single outbreak; no follow-up reports have followed the immediate notification of 12 Jan 2015. - Mod.AS]
