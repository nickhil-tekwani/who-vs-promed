Update No. 49, 1 Apr 2005 [edited]

Tree destruction proceeding on IP2
--------------------
Destruction of more citrus trees confirmed to have citrus canker (CC) is
underway on the second infected property (IP2) in the Emerald Pest
Quarantine Area (PQA). DPI&F inspection teams found the most recent CC
outbreak, 1.6 km from the closest known infection, during ongoing
surveillance of the property. Results were confirmed by laboratory analysis
on 17 Mar 2005.
All 27 000 trees covering 60.4 hectares in the latest destruction zone have
been sprayed with a copper fungicide. About half these trees, including all
known diseased trees, have been pushed over into windrows, ready for
burning. The remainder will be knocked down shortly. This will bring the
total number of commercial citrus trees that have been destroyed on IP2 to
132 000, or 63 per cent of the total area under citrus production on the
property. Elsewhere on IP2, work is continuing to ensure that regrowth of
citrus trees is minimised by disc ploughing and destroying the remaining
root material in the ground.
Surveillance update in the Emerald PQA
----------------------------
All surveillance for the current surveillance round in the PQA has been
completed except for some remaining areas of IP2. About 30 DPI&F
surveillance staff working 6 days a week expect to complete inspection of
the remaining 35 000 trees on IP2 by about mid-April 2005. No new
detections of the CC have been found on the property since the most recent
detection in mid-March.
Despite this latest detection on IP2, DPI&F is increasingly confident that
CC has not spread to other properties in the PQA, or outside the PQA. Once
this round of surveillance has been completed in the Emerald PQA, a 2nd
round will start almost immediately of the 5 citrus-growing businesses
covering 7 commercial citrus properties in the area. This 2nd surveillance
round is part of the process of ultimately achieving pest free-area status
for CC for the Emerald district.
The latest confirmed detection on IP2 in the PQA has not impacted on the
current status of citrus growers in other areas of Queensland. It also does
not change the status of other commercial orchards in the Emerald PQA,
where intensive surveillance has not found any sign of CC to date.

[Let's hope that the control procedures in place will successfully contain
CC in the affected areas of IP2. This problem has already exacted a huge
toll. - Mod.DH]
