After examining analyses in laboratories in the military medical institute
(Vojno medicinska akademija) in Belgrade the cause of disease, tularemia
(caused by _Francisella tularensis_) has been confirmed. The disease is
reported in the Serbian villages in Soko Banja region.
It is said that an epidemic of th disease has never been recorded in Serbia
as human tularemia. From 19-25 persons have fallen ill with the disease. Six
of them have a more serious form of the disease. Two of them are suspect
cases.The number of persons exposed to the disease has risen to 1431, but
the disease has been followed and it is under control.
