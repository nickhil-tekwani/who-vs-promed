Japan has had 2 cases of chronic hepatitis E infection, both confirmed to have been caused through blood transfusions, according to a nationwide study by the health ministry.

A woman in her 60s living in eastern Japan and a man in his 40s in the southwest contracted the virus from blood transfusions for liver transplant operations, ministry officials said Mon 26 Oct 2015. Chronic infection by hepatitis E virus is considered rare. These 2 cases were Japan's 1st, the officials said.

The 2 persons are believed to have developed the chronic infection due to the effect of immunosuppressive drugs they were taking following surgery. Both have already recovered, the officials said.

The study covered 1893 liver transplant patients. According to the Japanese Red Cross Society, donated blood for transfusions is tested for hepatitis E only in Hokkaido, where infections are relatively high compared with other parts of the country.

[The following discussion (with the citations removed) regarding various strains is from Kamar N, Bendall R, Florence Legrand-Abravanel F, et al: Hepatitis E. Lancet 2012;379: 2477-2488:

"Molecular characterization of various HEV [hepatitis E virus] strains circulating among human beings and animals has led to the recognition of 4 major genotypes, representing a single serotype. HEV1 and HEV2 are restricted to human beings and transmitted via contaminated water in developing countries. HEV1 occurs mainly in Asia, and HEV2 in Africa and Mexico. HEV3 and HEV4 infect human beings, pigs, and other mammalian species and are responsible for sporadic cases of autochthonous hepatitis E in both developing and developed countries. HEV3 has a worldwide distribution. By contrast, HEV4 mostly occurs in southeast Asia, but has recently been isolated in European pigs. Although HEV3 and HEV4 infections have been linked to the consumption of raw or undercooked pork or game meat, the full range of species that are reservoirs for HEV is still unknown. On the basis of full-length genome-sequence analyses, HEV genotypes have recently been characterized in rats in Germany, wild boars in Japan, and farmed rabbits in China. HEV1 can be classified into 5 subgenotypes, HEV2 into 2, HEV3 into 3, and HEV4 into 7. Phylogenetic analyses show that HEV subgenotypes circulating in human beings and animals in the same area are closely related, supporting zoonotic transmission. Studies of the evolutionary history and population dynamics of HEV show that HEV has evolved through a series of steps, in which the ancestors of HEV might have adapted to a succession of animal hosts leading to human beings."

Although generally considered to cause only acute infection, the review article also discusses chronic hepatitis E, which is defined by persisting HEV RNA in serum or stools for 6 months or more, in immunosuppressed patients. Most cases have occurred in solid-organ-transplant recipients. Additionally, a few cases have been reported in individuals with HIV and patients with hematological disorders receiving chemotherapy. Chronic infection with HEV1 or HEV2 has not been reported. - Mod.LL
