There have been 298 pertussis cases reported in San Diego County [California] in 2014, nearly 6 times the 53 reported this time in 2013, the county Health and Human Services Agency reported this week [week of 28 Apr 2014]. There were 18 cases of the illness, also known as whooping cough, reported last week [week of 21 Apr 2014], according to the agency. Infants not yet fully vaccinated are at highest risk for complications.

"Pertussis has shown no signs of slowing down and this high level of activity should be a concern for parents and caregivers," said Dr. Wilma Wooten, the county public health officer. "The vaccine's effectiveness lessens over time so it's very important that adults get their booster shots and that they make sure their children have the necessary doses of the vaccine at the recommended ages."

Pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, is on the rise in Long Beach [Los Angeles County, California], and city health officials are encouraging residents to immunize themselves and their families against the preventable disease. "A recent rise in pertussis in the city of Long Beach serves as a reminder that all age groups need to be properly immunized against this highly contagious disease," said Dr. Mitchell Kushner, health officer for the Long Beach Department of Health and Human Services.

So far in 2014, 42 confirmed cases of pertussis have been reported in Long Beach, but there have been no deaths. The majority of the cases are school-age children. Among the vaccine-preventable diseases, pertussis is the most common, according to health department.

Pertussis is a highly contagious disease that is spread by the coughing of an infected person. Unimmunized or incompletely immunized young infants are particularly vulnerable and at increased risk for severe complications. In these cases, parents, older siblings and others in the household are often the source of their infection. A typical case of pertussis in a child or adult starts with a cough and runny nose lasting up to 2 weeks, followed by weeks to months of rapid coughing fits. Infants, not yet fully vaccinated are at highest risk of complications.

To ensure all family members are protected from pertussis, everyone in the home should be vaccinated. Young children need 5 doses by kindergarten (ages 4 to 6). All students entering, advancing or transferring into 7th grade need proof of an adolescent whooping cough booster immunization (called "Tdap"). Pregnant women are recommended to receive a Tdap booster during their 3rd trimester of each pregnancy, even if they got it before pregnancy. Adults should receive Tdap in place of their routine 10-year tetanus (Td) booster, especially if they are in contact with infants or are healthcare workers.

Last week the Lewis and Clark County City-County Health Department was alerting the public to a rash of pertussis, or whooping cough, cases reported in the area. Now they're reporting 25 cases since the start of April 2014, and most of those cases are from students at Capital High School.

The school has been working in connection with the Lewis and Clark City-County Health Department to identify those infected and figure out who may have come into contact. In most cases, students have been vaccinated already, according to Capital High nurse, Kathy Boutilier, RN. "This is a vaccine that has a waning effectiveness. So, a number of variables that come into play as to why someone would get pertussis and why someone sitting next to them does not," said Boutilier.

Mike Henderson, a public health nurse at the Lewis and Clark City-County Health Department, said that despite that, now is a perfect time for everyone to check their immunization status. Henderson said infants are the most vulnerable to pertussis, because the condition can be serious and even fatal, and they haven't been fully immunized for it yet [see vaccination schedules in the comment below]. In addition to high school-age kids, there is a pre-school-age child, and several adults who have been diagnosed with pertussis [in this outbreak].

Whooping cough cases are on the rise in Kennebunk [York County, Maine] and parents are on alert. A total of 6 cases have been reported this week [week of 28 Apr 2014]. The superintendent sent an email to parents letting them know what's being done to keep kids at school, but it also talks about how prevention starts at home. "We don't want to raise concern about issues that aren't significant. We don't want to create hysteria, but it is important to share when there are situations where there is a contagious disease that we want folks to be aware of," said Superintendent Andrew Dolloff.

This week, a student at the Middle School of the Kennebunks contracted the disease, making it the 6th case district-wide and the 4th at the school. Each confirmed case means a mandatory 5 days away from the school to help stop the spread.

[CDC has the following recommendation: "Children should get 5 doses of DTaP, one dose at each of the following ages: 2, 4, 6, and 15 through 18 months and 4 through 6 years." http://www.cdc.gov/Vaccines/vpd-vac/pertussis/default.htm. in the UK, "Children are vaccinated against whooping cough at 2, 3 and 4 months of age, and again with the 4-in-1 pre-school booster before starting school at the age of about three years." http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Whooping-cough/Pages/Introduction.aspx. - Mod.JW]

[Vaccination of the pregnant mother towards the end of gestation is probably the best individual way of protecting an, as yet, not fully vaccinated infant against the morbidity and mortality of pertussis.

Clearly, much of the severe morbidity and almost all of the mortality from _Bordetella pertussis_ infection occur in those younger than 6 months. As many as 63 per cent of infants younger than 6 months of age with pertussis require hospitalization. In this CDC report from infants with pertussis in 1997-2000, there were 11.8 per cent with pneumonia, 1.4 per cent with seizures, 0.2 per cent with encephalopathy, and 0.8 per cent died [56/7203]. This compared with parallel numbers of 28 per cent, 8.6 per cent, 0.7 per cent, 0.1 per cent, and less than 0.1 per cent in infants 6-11 months of age (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5104a1.htm).

Neonatal pertussis is observed to be especially severe with as much as a 3 percent risk of death. Symptoms can be substantially different with periods of apnea [breathing arrest] sometimes with hypoxia-induced [low oxygen] seizures usually the most common manifestation of infection. The cough is present, but so weak that it may be unrecognized. In these children with so-called malignant pertussis, leukocytosis, particularly with white blood cell (WBC) counts of 30 000 to 100 000 and severe pulmonary hypertension are ominous signs for mortality. In a study comparing neonatal pertussis to other neonatal respiratory infections, pertussis-positive neonates had longer hospital stays, less fever, more apnea and cyanosis spells, and required more days of supplemental O2 in the hospital and represented all the infants discharged on respiratory supportive care. - Mod.LL
