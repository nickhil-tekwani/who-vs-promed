[Well, the official reports from this week are somewhat disconcerting, with 3 newly confirmed WPV1 associated cases identified (1 in Afghanistan and 2 in Pakistan), plus 11 WPV positive environmental samples in Pakistan, suggesting continued significant circulation of the WPV. With one-third of the year 2019 passed, 72.9% of the total number of positive samples found in 2018 has been reached. It is important to mention the 2 newly confirmed cases in Lahore discussed in sections [2] and [3] below.

As for the cVDPVs, the only positive report this week was a positive environmental sample in Borno State, Nigeria, a location with previously positive environmental samples, but without reports of identified AFP cases to account for the positive environmental sample.

Hence, I haven't changed my impressions from previous posts, reflecting continued concerns (see my comments in Poliomyelitis update (29): WPV1, cVDPV, continued violence 20190425.6440803).

For a map showing the locations of cases of WPV and cVDPV, see http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/.

[2] Pakistan (Lahore) new case - media report
Date: Thu 2 May 2019
Source: Daily Times [edited]
https://dailytimes.com.pk/386794/ninth-case-of-polio-virus-emerges-in-lahore/


According to Health Department officials, a 10-year-old boy from Lahore has been infected with the polio virus, thus bringing the tally to 9. "Samples were collected on [2 Apr 2019] and sent to Islamabad for confirmation. The virus belongs to an Outfall Pumping Station in Lahore," said an official deputed in the polio laboratory of the National Institute of Health.

"It is worrying that for the 2nd time this year [2019] a 10-year-old boy has been infected with the polio virus," the lab official remarked. "This is why it was decided that polio vaccine would be administered to children of up to age of 10 years in core reservoirs including Rawalpindi and Peshawar. However, because of refusals in Peshawar we were unable to do so," he said, referring to the recent vaccination campaign issues in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

The Prime Minister's Focal Person on Polio Eradication, Babar bin Atta, confirmed the news to a private news outlet. Mr. Atta said, "It is unfortunate that for 4 years, the previous Punjab government remained in a state of denial regarding the presence of polio virus. There was no one to take the ownership of the [polio eradication] programme. Though the polio virus was being reported from Lahore but the Punjab government would say that the virus belonged to Peshawar. But we could also have turned around and said that the virus in Peshawar originates in Afghanistan and not take ownership of the issue. We have to take steps to eradicate it [virus]."

Responding to a question about the increase in refusal rates, he said, "It is proof that the communication strategy for the polio vaccination programme has failed. We must remove the concerns of parents and need to come up with a better communication strategy."

The categorization of the 9 polio cases that have been reported so far is as follows: 2 each from Lahore and Bannu, and 1 each from Hangu, Waziristan, Bajaur, Khyber Tribal district, and Karachi.

[3] Pakistan (Lahore) 2nd new case - media report
Date: Fri 3 May 2019

Another case of polio has been surfaced in Lahore, after which the toll has reached 10 in the city. According to details, the victim was identified as 13-year-old girl.

"Samples were collected on [2 Apr 2019] and sent to Islamabad for confirmation. The virus belongs to an Outfall Pumping Station in Lahore," an official at polio laboratory of the National Institute of Health said.

Efforts to eliminate polio in Pakistan have become complicated in recent years, as polio workers have faced attacks by militants who say the health teams are Western spies, or that the vaccines they administer are intended to sterilise children.

Polio is endemic in only 3 countries in the world, although a relatively rare strain was also detected in Papua New Guinea at the end of last year [2018].

Polio is a highly contagious disease caused by a virus that invades the nervous system and can cause total paralysis within hours. It mainly affects children under the age of 5 years.

[These 2 newly confirmed cases of polio identified in Lahore are confirmed on the End Polio Pakistan website (see http://www.endpolio.com.pk/polioin-pakistan/polio-cases-in-provinces and http://www.endpolio.com.pk/polioin-pakistan/polio-cases-district-wise-2019), making them the 9th and 10th confirmed cases in 2019, and the 2nd and 3rd cases of 2019 identified in Lahore. This will also bring the global total up to 17. There is the suggestion that both of these cases were identified through environmental screening related to positive isolates collected on 2 Apr 2019 at the Outfall Pumping Station in Lahore. So when we read of the positive isolates in the weekly report, we know that the polio teams are out in the field doing an active search for AFP cases (and culturing) those found who reside in areas known to use the sewage pump stations where there were positive environmental samples. Oftentimes these positive samples are most likely related to asymptomatic or mild symptomatic infections not associated with paralytic disease, and therefore will not be identified as AFP cases. As a reminder there is an average of one paralytic case for every 200 infections with the WPV.

It is noteworthy that both of the newly confirmed cases from Lahore were in children ages 10 and above, suggesting there may be an increasing number of susceptibles in the older age-groups that previously may have been protected through "herd immunity" but with increasing vaccine refusals leading to lower vaccination coverages, this protective effect of high coverages is disappearing.

Lahore is the capital city of Punjab province in Pakistan and has an estimated population of 12.2 million people in 2019. A map showing its location can be found at https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/pakistan_map.htm. - Mod.MPP]

[4] Pakistan, social media requested to remove antivaccination messages - media report
Date: Fri 3 May 2019
Source: Urdu Point [edited]
https://www.urdupoint.com/en/health/facebook-management-asked-to-remove-anti-poli-612540.html


The government has asked Facebook management to remove antipolio content available on its accounts. The Prime Minister's Focal Person on Polio eradication, Babar Bin Atta, requested Facebook's management to block or manage the dissemination of such antivaccination propaganda from their platforms operating from within Pakistan. He said that the harmful content is not just jeopardising the polio eradication initiative but also putting the lives of our antipolio vaccinators at risk.

According to official correspondence signed by the PM's Focal Person on Polio eradication, he expressed appreciation for Facebook's policies and regulations dealing with hateful content and propaganda. A statement issued from the National Emergency Operations Centre said that it is high time that Pakistan takes strict measures to regulate vaccine-related harmful content available on social media to address the misconceptions about polio vaccine. The parental refusal due to propaganda on Facebook regarding the vaccine is emerging as the major obstacle in achieving complete eradication of the virus.

It said that Pakistan has made great strides in eradicating polio; however, concerns of vaccine safety and efficacy fueled by antivaccine propaganda on social media have generated a high number of vaccine refusals from parents and children reported as missing during immunization campaigns.

Effectively communicating and inspiring refusal communities to support the programme is essential in order to close immunity gaps and ultimately end virus transmission in the country. The National Polio Eradication Programme has compiled a sample report of some of the Facebook pages and provided them to the head of public policy of Facebook. These pages have been engaging in harmful propaganda against vaccination in particular and generally about the Pakistan Polio Eradication Programme.

The content shared within this report is in violation of Facebooks policies as per its community standards, particularly its clause referring to integrity and authenticity.

The letter said that this content stands to incite harm and violence against polio workers, and may further deteriorate the programme's coverage of vulnerable children and their subsequent immunity against the polio virus.

[Social media, including Facebook, has been a main source of communication for the antivaxxer movement globally, and it seems as though Pakistan hasn't been spared from this. In recent weeks, Facebook has announced they will remove such content from their pages. Globally there has been a major resurgence of measles that has had major contributions from the antivaxxer movement using social media to propagate false information on the dangers of the vaccine, compared with the "minor risk" of the actual disease. It is sad to see it is now playing into the polio eradication effort, especially when no one can make claims the disease is mild when paralysis is the outcome. - Mod.MPP]
