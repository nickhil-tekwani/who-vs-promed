Classical swine fever [CSF] is spreading in swine farms of the
Vladimir oblast with concerning regularity. The outbreaks coincided
with new ownerships of several swine farms. The regional
representative of Rospotrebnadzor [Russian Federal Trade & Sanitary
Inspection Authority] believes that the governor of the oblast should
compensate the businesses for losses. Currently, the infected premises
are only fenced off, to limit animal movements. The animal population
has not been culled yet because of pending laboratory results.
However, nobody is doubtful about the diagnosis of CSF since it has
been confirmed as the cause of a recent 5 outbreaks during the last 3
months.

The regional representative of Rospotrebnadzor has elaborated on the
reasons why the outbreaks happen with such regularity. According to
him, Rospotrebnadzor together with police patrols have witnessed,
during the last 6 months, numerous cases of unauthorized animal
movements, avoiding veterinary certification. There is no complete
registry of animal populations and consequently no way to have a
complete immunization project. The fodder trade is also out of
control; the batches of fodder can come from any corner of the country
including food leftovers from jails and military kitchens. He has also
reported that the biggest swine farm of the region is under special
attention, and luckily it has not been affected by CSF. The last 3
outbreaks have affected the farms in Kameshkovskiy rayon, and the very
last one has taken place in the village Istomino.
