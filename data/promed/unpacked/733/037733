An exotic and potentially deadly tick-borne parasite has been found in the UK for the 1st time.

A study conducted by the University of Glasgow found the parasite in sheep in the north east of Scotland.

This is the 1st time the organism, called _Babesia venatorum_, has ever been found in sheep anywhere in the world.

The parasite causes a disease called babesiosis which is recognised as an emerging infection in human health.

It has been extensively recorded in China and in Europe with 2 human infections confirmed in Italy in the last 20 years.

Babesiosis is treatable in most cases, although this depends on rapid and accurate diagnosis.

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said infected people may get symptoms such as flu and jaundice but severe cases can lead to death.

Scientists believed the risk of people contracting this infection, however, is believed to be low.

Researchers targeted areas where tick-borne viruses had been previously detected and collected blood from sheep, cattle, and deer.

Scientists believed the parasite could have travelled to the north east of Scotland via migrating birds from Scandinavian countries.

Dr Willie Weir, from the University of Glasgow, said: "The presence of _B. venatorum_ in the UK represents a new risk to humans working, living, or hiking in areas with infected ticks and livestock, particularly sheep.

"Although we believe the threat to humans to be low, nevertheless local health and veterinary professionals will need to be aware of the disease if the health risk from tick-borne disease in the UK is to be fully understood."

[For the University of Glasgow study mentioned above please see ref. 1 below. Its "conclusions" section (references omitted) follows:

"This study confirms that _B. venatorum_ is present in the UK, but it remains unclear how the parasite entered the country because there was no history of imported animals at either farm surveyed. However, the survey sites are situated near the main landing areas for migratory birds coming to the UK from continental Europe, particularly Norway, and _B. venatorum_ has been found in ticks collected from the environment and in migratory birds in Scandinavia. We postulate that birds could act as an import vector for ticks carrying _B. venatorum_.

"The presence of _B. venatorum_ in the UK represents a new risk to humans working, living, or hiking in areas harboring infected ticks and livestock, particularly sheep. As such, local health and veterinary professionals will need to be aware of the disease if the risk for tick-borne disease in the UK is to be fully understood.

"Current UK medical inclusion criteria for babesiosis focus on identifying cattleborne _B. divergens_. Going forward, consideration of _B. venatorum_, through careful morphologic description of blood smears and sequencing of informative regions of the 18S SSU rRNA gene, will
be necessary for accurate diagnosis and correctly targeted treatment regimens.

"Our study has revealed that sheep are a natural host for _B. venatorum_ in the UK. Previously, roe deer were believed to be the main vertebrate host for this parasite in Europe. It is unclear why _B. venatorum_ has not previously been detected in sheep, although it may be that infection in this host species occurs only in particular foci or is limited to the UK. Thus, ongoing active surveillance of Babesia species in UK livestock would be useful to fully understand the prevalence and transmission of the disease. Such information may be critical for controlling the spread of babesiosis because sheep are routinely transported large distances (including across international borders) and are closely associated with tick habitats. Our study also suggests that the role that livestock plays in _B. venatorum_ transmission in continental Europe should be reassessed."

The authors state that their finding "represents a novel potential threat to animal and human health"; however, clinical signs in sheep, in case observed, have not become available yet. In this respect, a case report describing fatal acute babesiosis associated with _B. venatorum_ infection in a captive reindeer calf in Switzerland deserves attention (ref. 2).

_Babesia_ are intraerythrocytic protozoan pathogens transmitted by ticks; their clinical manifestation is comparable to malaria. More than 100 _Babesia_ spp have been identified in wild and domestic animals. Babesia that infect livestock have had a significant worldwide economic impact and include _B. bigemina_, _B. bovis_, _B. divergens_, and _B. major_. Other animals infected by _Babesia_ spp include horses (_B. caballi_), dogs (_B. canis_), cats (_B. felis_), deer (_B. odocolei_), and rodents (_B. microti_). Several _Babesia_ spp have been found to cause disease in humans. These are _B. microti_, _B. crassa_-like pathogen, _B. divergens_, _B. duncani_, and _B. venatorum_, as well as several other _Babesia_ that are closely genetically related (_B. divergens_-like, _B. duncani_-type, _B. microti_-like) or described in a single case (K01, XXB/Hang/Zhou). In Europe, the probable or confirmed vector of _Babesia_ is the tick _Ixodes ricinus_. Parts of the above information have been extracted from ref. 3.
