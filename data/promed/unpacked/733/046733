----------------------------------------------------------------------
During 2011/12, 50 banana plants of cultivar 'Horn' with moko disease symptoms were randomly sampled in 12 different locations of 5 states in Peninsular Malaysia comprising Kedah, Selangor, Pahang, Negeri Sembilan, and Johor, with disease incidence exceeding 90 percent in some plantations. The disease symptoms observed in the infected plants included yellowing and wilting of the oldest leaves, which became necrotic, and eventually led to their dieback or collapse. The pulp of banana fruits also became discolored and exuded bacterial ooze. Vascular tissues in pseudostems were discolored.

Fragments from symptomatic plants were cultured [and] 20 positive samples produced colonies characteristic of biovar 1 _Ralstonia solanacearum_. For pathogenicity tests, inoculations with all isolates were performed. Inoculated plants produced the same symptoms as naturally diseased [plants], whereas control plants remained asymptomatic.

PCR amplification using race 2 _R. solanacearum_ primers produced a 1900-bp product from all bacterial strains [which] were 95 to 98 percent identical to published _R. solanacearum_ race 2 sequences. Phylotype-specific multiplex PCR (Pmx-PCR) and _Musa_-specific multiplex PCR (Mmx-PCR) showed that all isolates belonged to phylotype II, [and] Mmx-PCR [also] showed that they belonged to sequevar 4.

Although there were previously studies on _R. solanacearum_ associated with bacterial wilt disease of banana crops in Malaysia, no [strains] related to moko disease has been reported. The results have great importance to better understand and document _R. solanacearum_ race 2 biovar 1.

[Moko as well as the other bacterial wilts of banana known as blood disease and bugtok, are caused by members of the _R. solanacearum_ (Rs) species complex (see link below). Within the complex, strains causing moko and bugtok are closely related causing similar symptoms (including wilting, fruit rot, blackening of suckers, bacterial ooze), but the blood disease bacterium is more distantly related with characteristic red internal discolouration ("blood") of fruits and pseudostems. All 3 diseases cause severe yield losses and eventually death of the plants.

The bacteria are spread by water, wind, infected plant material or soil, and mechanical means (including human activities, animals, insects). Ornamentals and weed species may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Infection can occur via roots or flowers depending on the host cultivar and pathogen strain. The primary means of control is exclusion from areas that are disease-free and eradication of infected plants where the pathogens are present. Disease management may also include cultural, chemical (for example soil treatments), and biocontrol (antagonistic microorganisms) measures or combinations of these. Certified clean planting material is essential. No resistant banana cultivars are known.

So far, moko was known to occur in the New World and the Philippines, bugtok only in the Philippines, and blood disease only in the Indonesian archipelago. Since 2008 (ProMED-mail post 20081215.3937), an undiagnosed lethal disease of bananas has been spreading in Malaysia. Around 40 percent of banana plants in the country were reported to be affected by 2012 (ProMED-mail post 20120106.1001287) and spread of blood disease from Indonesia was suspected. With the molecular identification of moko above this now seems less likely, although the simultaneous occurrence of both pathogens cannot be excluded.
