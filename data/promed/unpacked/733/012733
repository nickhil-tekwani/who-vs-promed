Maryland Gov. Parris N. Glendening (D) said yesterday that a microscopic
organism that killed thousands of fish in an Eastern Shore river almost
surely has sickened people exposed to it, marking the first time that a
state government has declared that the organism harmed people in a natural
environment. He said "that the Pfiesteria [piscicida] toxin has caused
health problems in 13 individuals."
Glendening announced the immediate closure of an eight-mile stretch of the
river that had previously been under a health advisory. Virginia officials
followed suit, closing a portion of the river in that state. Under the
Maryland order, the lower portion of the Pocomoke is off-limits to all but
transiting boats. Water-skiing, fishing and water biking are banned
indefinitely.
At the start of the news conference, Glendening described an unqualified
link between Pfiesteria and human health problems. But as medical officials
flanking him talked in greater detail, they qualified the link as a "high
probability."
Glendening was briefed before the news conference by a team of doctors who
examined 13 people, including three state employees who had sampled water
near a massive fish kill Aug. 6 to 9 and a water-skier who spent an hour on
the Pocomoke 10 days before the kill.
The most common symptoms were rashes, burning skin and eye irritation.
Most significantly, 10 of the 11 people showed minor memory problems and
confusion similar to those associated with concussions, said J. Glenn
Morris Jr., a professor of medicine at the University of Maryland who
headed the team.
On Wednesday, four of the seven underwent a sophisticated brain scan, which
confirmed that they showed a particular abnormality of the brain apparently
caused by exposure to Pfiesteria, Morris said. "That was the confirmation."
"We are no longer skeptical," said Wasserman, who previously had stressed
the lack of such an established connection.
Morris said doctors determined Pfiesteria's effect on the individuals by
following a trail of "circumstantial evidence:" the presence of Pfiesteria
in the river; reports of symptoms from people exposed to the river; and
doctors' determination that nothing else could have caused the memory losses.
Earlier this year, a government-sponsored East Carolina University survey
found no conclusive evidence that Pfiesteria had caused the health problems
among those using coastal waters.

Morris said the duration of human health problems associated with
Pfiesteria isn't known. "We have a sense that these people are getting
better," he said.

Why the microbe is flourishing in the Pocomoke remains unclear. State
biologists say the river contains too much nitrogen and phosphorous, but no
more than other bay tributaries. Some environmentalists have speculated
that Pfiesteria might bloom after a strong rainfall washes extra nutrients
or other contaminants into the river.
[Note: The Governor's press conference was the lead story on many local news
stations in the
Baltimore-Washington area.]

Maryland and Virginia have closed nearly a third of the Pocomoke River to
boaters after seven people became ill with symptoms health officials blame
on a waterborne toxin. The illnesses were "likely" related to pfiesteria, a
single-cell organism that is believed to kill fish by feeding on blood and
leaving them with open sores. Officials suspect pfiesteria of killing
11,000 fish on the river earlier this month.
Thirteen people complained of various health problems after coming into
contact with the river or with dead or dying fish. Seven complained of a
mild memory loss, similar to a mild concussion. The problem could be
explained only by exposure to a waterborne toxin, said Dr. Glenn Morris,
part of the medical team that evaluated the victims. The team cannot say
for sure that the problems, which also included skin rashes and respiratory
problems such as wheezing, were caused by toxins released by _pfiesteria
piscicida_ or a similar one-celled organism.
All activities on the closed [section of the] river are prohibited, though
boaters can reach the Pocomoke Sound by way of the upper Pocomoke. The
river will be
reopened when any potential health danger is ruled out.
