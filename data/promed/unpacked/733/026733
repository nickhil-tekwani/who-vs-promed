Health Department alerts New York City doctors to measles
---------------------------------------------------------
The Health Department has identified 11 cases of measles in Brooklyn in the
past 2 months, and is urging doctors to be vigilant and promptly report
suspected cases to the agency. Nearly all the known cases have occurred in
children who went unvaccinated, leaving them unprotected against the
disease. Measles is not common in New York City, but it is highly contagious.

"Children should be vaccinated against measles at one year of age," said Dr
Jane R Zucker, the Health Department's assistant commissioner for
immunization. "Vaccinating eligible children will protect them and help
protect infants who are too young to be vaccinated, by reducing their risk
of exposure. Delaying a child's vaccination increases the risk of
contracting measles and infecting others."

Measles causes fever, rash, cough, runny nose and red eyes. As many as one
in 3 children with measles develop complications such as diarrhea, ear
infection or pneumonia. Some children have to be hospitalized, and some can
even die. Younger children, and those with weakened immune systems, are the
most likely to suffer severe illness. People who contract the measles virus
can spread the infection for 5 days before developing a rash, and for four
days after the rash sets in.

Measles vaccination is required for admission to the city's schools,
colleges, and daycare centers. The 1st measles vaccine dose should be given
at the time of the child's 1st birthday, with the 2nd dose being
administered at 4 to 6 years of age.

To protect yourself and your family from measles:
- babies should receive the 1st measles shot at 1 year of age.
- vaccinating older kids is the best way to protect children who are too
young to get the shot.
- if your child is over 1 year of age and has not had the measles shot, it
is important to get the child vaccinated as soon as possible to prevent
measles.
- a total of 2 doses of measles vaccine are required for life-long
protection. Children should get a 2nd measles shot at 4 to 6 years of age.
Older children and adults who have not received 2 measles shots (or had the
disease itself) may be at risk of infection.
- be sure that you and your family are fully vaccinated prior to
international travel. Measles is found in many parts of the world,
including Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.

Ask your doctor about vaccinating your children. For more information on
