Leishmaniasis in southern Sudan
-------------------------------
The worst outbreak of "black fever" in nearly a decade has hit
Southern Sudan. Unless it's treated, kala azar -- also known as
visceral leishmaniasis -- kills nearly all of those infected. The
World Health Organization estimates that there are up to 500 000 new
cases every year.

Leishmaniasis is spread by sandfly bites and symptoms include
anaemia, nausea, and a swollen liver or spleen, where the parasites
multiply, overwhelming the immune system.

The commonest treatment is an antimonial drug from the 1930s, SSG
[sodium stibogluconate], which is very toxic and can itself kill.
Koert Ritmeijer, head of Medecins Sans Frontieres medical department
in Amsterdam, says at their clinic in Malakal they are now using a
shorter combination treatment which is less toxic.

[A woman] who has travelled from the village of Adong to get to the
clinic has 4 children, and 3 of them have had kala azar. She says many
families cannot afford the trip to the clinic even when their children
are very sick.

[The outbreak has probably been unfolding over several years.
ProMED-mail reported increasing numbers of patients already in 2002
and 2003 (see below). The present news release from the BBC underlines
that the control measures over the past 8 years have not succeeded.
Leishmaniasis is associated with malnutrition and HIV, and we have no
information on the HIV prevalence in patients with leishmania in the
area or the rate of malnutrition.
