Colombia (virus genotype). 23 Oct 2015. (reported) a study demonstrated exclusively the presence of the Asian genotype in Colombia. An average of 0.001 base substitutions per site, with 99.7 percent and 99.9 percent nucleotide identity and 99.9 percent amino acid identity was obtained among Colombian sequences and other sequences from The Americas. The adaptive evolution analysis demonstrated that E1 gene is under strong purifying selection. The circulation of the Asian genotype of CHIKV was identified as the responsible for the first epidemic in Colombia.

[2] Morbidity, USA Virgin Islands

People in the U.S. Virgin Islands who were diagnosed with chikungunya had a higher prevalence of arthralgia that kept them away from work, researchers reported. Among 156 chikungunya cases, 78.8 percent said they missed work due to joint pain, according to Leora Feldstein, a PhD candidate at the University of Washington in Seattle, and colleagues.

"On average, people who had been diagnosed with chikungunya reported missing 8.5 days of work in the 6 months following the disease," Feldstein said at her poster presentation at the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene meeting [in October 2015]. She added that "individuals diagnosed with chikungunya virus, regardless of presence of persistent arthralgia, missed a substantial number of days of work and of daily activities due to infection."

Feldstein and her colleagues also reported that the prevalence of persistent daily arthralgia among cases was more than twice that of healthy noncases.

Chikungunya infection typically is manifested as fever and polyarthralgia, Feldstein explained. These acute symptoms often resolve within 7 - 10 days, but 5 - 60 percent of these patients have reported persistent arthralgia for months. The disease is transmitted by mosquitoes, and is widespread and endemic in Asia and Africa.

Feldstein's group evaluated clinical and functional outcomes of patients infected during the 2014-2015 outbreak that occurred mainly on St. Thomas [USA Virgin Islands in the Caribbean]. Patients included in the study had chikungunya disease diagnosed through positive tests that confirmed either presence of the virus, or presence of positive virus-specific neutralizing antibodies.

At the peak of the outbreak, more than 20 cases per 1000 people on St. Thomas, St. Croix, and St. John were diagnosed. 6 months after the initial diagnosis, the researchers interviewed patients with the disease (64.2 percent women; mean age 48.9). Outcomes were compared with 179 healthy noncases (65 percent women; mean age 34.3).

At the baseline interview, 33.1 percent of the chikungunya cases reported arthralgia compared with 10 percent of the controls (P<0.001). Within the previous 30 days, 51 percent of the cases reported arthralgia compared with 19.9 percent of the controls (P<0.001).

"Overall the prevalence rate10 of persistent arthralgia -- adjusted for age and the history of arthritis -- was 2.53 (95 percent CI 1.87-3.41)," Feldstein reported.

More than 70 percent of the laboratory confirmed chikungunya cases reported pain in 1 or more joints, while about 35 percent said they had pain in more than 2 joints. About 45 percent of these patients reported knee joint pain, 40 percent said they had arthralgia in their ankles, about 38 percent reported pain in their feet, and a similar percentage said there was pain in their fingers. They also reported pain in wrists, shoulders, elbows, hips, and toes.

At 6 months post-disease onset, 26.3 percent of cases reported difficulty walking versus 12.9 percent of healthy noncases (P=0.002 for difference in proportions). The authors stated that chikungunya cases will be interviewed at 12 months after acute infection to determine whether the prevalence of persistent arthralgia remains.

Summary
3 adult Venezuelan patients with virologically conﬁrmed chikungunya fever, who developed extensive acute nasal skin necrosis early in the course of a life-threatening illness characterized by shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, are discussed. 1 patient survived and fully recovered. Nasal necrosis has not previously been associated with the disease.

Scott C. Weaver. Utilization of an Eilat virus-based chimera for serological detection of chikungunya infection.

Abstract
In December of 2013, chikungunya virus (CHIKV), an alphavirus in the family Togaviridae, was introduced to the island of Saint Martin in the Caribbean, resulting in the 1st [confirmed] autochthonous cases reported in the Americas. As of January 2015, local and imported CHIKV has been reported in 50 American countries with over 1.1 million suspected cases. CHIKV causes a severe arthralgic disease for which there are no approved vaccines or therapeutics. Furthermore, the lack of a commercially available, sensitive, and affordable diagnostic assay limits surveillance and control efforts. To address this issue, we utilized an insect-specific alphavirus, Eilat virus (EILV), to develop a diagnostic antigen that does not require biosafety containment facilities to produce. We demonstrated that EILV/CHIKV replicates to high titers in insect cells and can be applied directly in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays without inactivation, resulting in highly sensitive detection of recent and past CHIKV infection, and outperforming traditional antigen preparations.

Author summary
We have developed an innovative approach to production of alphavirus antigens for use in diagnostic assays that results in reduced production complexity as well as improved sensitivity in application. By generating recombinant viruses that contain the structural protein genes of pathogenic alphaviruses and the nonstructural protein genes of an insect-specific alphavirus, Eilat virus, we have been able to produce insect-restricted viruses that are antigenically identical to their pathogenic counterparts. The insect-specific nature of these chimeric viruses yields an advantageous safety profile and allows for safe handling of the antigen at the bench top. Traditional antigens, produced from wild-type virus, require extensive processing, from growth at biosafety level 3 to concentration and inactivation, followed by lyophilization, which often compromises antigen reactivity and is financially costly. Furthermore, current inactivation methods are imperfect processes that have historically resulted in residual live virus and subsequent breach of containment when used in a diagnostic setting. Other approaches, such as recombinant antigens generated from viral particle subunits, are missing conformational epitopes and their application results in reduced sensitivity. Here we describe the development of a diagnostic assay using this technology for the detection of chikungunya infection in humans.

Discussion
While we have shown the utility of an EILV-based chimera as an ELISA antigen, further testing and evaluation is needed to define parameters for the clear discrimination between positive and negative results. We have shown that our anti-CHIKV IgM and IgG ELISAs can distinguish between human infections caused by CHIKV and VEEV or DENV with a high degree of signal separation. However, because other closely related alphaviruses co-circulate in most if not all CHIKF-endemic regions (e.g. Mayaro virus in South America), more extensive testing is needed to rule out false positives due to cross-reactivity with antibodies elicited by other alphaviruses, and thus determine the specificity of this assay. Also, while we have performed accelerated-decay studies to evaluate the stability of EILV/CHIKV in liquid storage, real-time stability studies need to be performed to determine the long-term stability of the antigen at 4°C

[If the antigen performs well in future tests, this approach could provide antigens for serological diagnosis of chikungunya virus infections. The inexpensive and safe production and use of the antigen in serological tests are attractive features. However, creation of the EILV/CHIKV chimeras with subsequent testing for quality control is beyond the capability of many diagnostic laboratories where chikungunya virus outbreaks have been occurring. If the antigen does perform well in future tests, the next question then becomes, will it become available from reference laboratories or commercially at low cost? - Mod.TY]
