A case of Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD), also known as monkey fever, a viral disease transmitted to humans through a species of ticks usually found on monkeys, has been reported from the Panavally area under the Appapara Family Health Centre (FHC) in Thirunelly grama panchayat in Wayanad district [Kerala state].

The patient, a 24 year old man engaged in collecting minor forest produces from the nearby forest, is undergoing treatment at the Government Medical College Hospital, Mananthavady, and his condition is reported to be stable. He was hospitalised on 29 Jan 2022 after he was referred from the FHC. The samples from the patient were sent to the Public Health Laboratory at Sulthan Bathery, and it had been confirmed as a case of KFD, district medical officer K Sakeena said.

Surveillance has been stepped up in the hotspots identified by the health department on the forest fringes in the district, Dr Sakeena said. Frontline forest staff and the high-risk population on the forest fringes have been advised to use personal protection measures, including gloves and gumboots, and repellent lotions before entering forests, she said. Forest personnel have been asked to collect details of unnatural deaths of monkeys in areas where the disease had been reported.

[The case described in the above report above is the 2nd reported case of Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) from India in 2022; the 1st was detected in Shivamogga district, Karnataka state. The source of the infection is not identified in the above report. In this regard, it is essential to ensure appropriate biorisk management when investigating the reservoir/source of such cases and sample collection from dead monkeys, as well as proper disposal of carcass(es).

Hard ticks (_Hemaphysalis spinigera_) are the reservoir of KFD virus (KFDV) and once infected they remain so for life. Rodents, shrews, and monkeys are common hosts for KFDV after being bitten by an infected tick. KFDV can cause epizootics with high fatality in primates. Transmission to humans may occur after a tick bite or contact with an infected animal, most importantly a sick or recently dead monkey. No person-to-person transmission has been described. There is no specific treatment for KFD, but early hospitalization and supportive therapy is important. Supportive therapy includes the maintenance of hydration and the usual precautions for patients with bleeding disorders.

A KFD vaccine has been developed and is in use in endemic areas of India. Additional preventative measures include use of insect repellents and wearing protective clothing in areas where ticks are endemic (https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/kyasanur/pdf/factsheet.pdf).

Wayanad is an Indian district in the north east of Kerala state with administrative headquarters at the municipality of Kalpetta (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayanad_district. - Mod.UBA
