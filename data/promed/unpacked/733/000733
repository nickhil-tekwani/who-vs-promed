United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) officials released a situation report on 17 Oct 2019 confirming 8 new vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-affected premises.

Five of the newly confirmed positive premises are in the following Colorado counties:

Garfield (2)
Larimer (2)
Moffat (1)

Moffat is the only newly infected county identified since the last situation report on 10 Oct 2019.

The remaining 3 premises -- all new suspect premises -- are in Fremont County, Wyoming.

Previously VSV-infected or suspect premises released from quarantine by the USDA since the last situation report include:

Colorado (8)
Nebraska (6)
Wyoming (7)

Thus far in 2019, the USDA has identified VSV-affected premises in Colorado (683), Nebraska (24), New Mexico (76), Oklahoma (1), Texas (171), Utah (22), and Wyoming (147).

All VSV-affected premises have been released from quarantine in Oklahoma, Nebraska, New Mexico, Texas, and Utah.

States with quarantined counties remaining (with names and number of premises) include:

Colorado:
Garfield (7); Jefferson (1); Larimer (3); Moffat (1); Morgan (1); San Miguel (2).

Wyoming:
Albany (3); Big Horn (1); Carbon (1); Fremont (8); Goshen (2); Hot Springs (6); Park (30); and Platte (6).

The agency quarantines confirmed-positive and suspect premises for at least 14 days following the onset of lesions in the animal last affected on the premises,

Vesicular stomatitis virus can cause blisters and sores in the mouth and on the tongue, muzzle, teats, or hooves of horses, cattle, swine, sheep, goats, llamas, and a number of other animals. Lesions usually heal in 2 or 3 weeks.

Because of the virus' contagious nature and its resemblance to other diseases such as foot and mouth disease, animal health officials urge livestock owners and caretakers to report these symptoms to their veterinarian immediately. Most animals recover with supportive care by a veterinarian.

"Vesicular stomatitis has been conÔ¨Årmed only in the Western Hemisphere," APHIS said on its website. "It is known to be an endemic disease in the warmer regions of North, Central, and South America, and outbreaks of the disease in other temperate geographic parts of the hemisphere occur sporadically. The Southwestern and Western United States have experienced a number of vesicular stomatitis outbreaks, (and) the most recent and largest VS outbreak occurred in 2015. Outbreaks usually occur during the warmer months, often along waterways."

Some states and other countries might restrict movement of, or impose additional requirements for, susceptible animals from states having known VS cases. Before moving livestock, contact the state of destination for its requirements.
