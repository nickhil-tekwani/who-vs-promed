The Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology (RGCB), which initiated
studies on the chikungunya scourge, has submitted a preliminary
report, pointing to a heavy viral load in all parts of Kerala,
besides establishing the disease as the cause for the recent viral
fever outbreak in the State.
E.P. Yeshodharan, Executive Vice-Chairman of the Kerala Council for
Science and Technology, told The Hindu on Sunday [22 Jul 2007], that
the centre, recently elevated as a national institute of excellence,
had drawn samples from patients in the fever-affected districts. The
analyses showed a high presence of the chikungunya virus. Further
studies would be conducted now, he said.
After reaching a dead-end in seeking explanations on the epidemic,
the State Government decided to ask the centre, the best-equipped
institute for carrying out such studies in the State, to provide
clues for the outbreak. Officials at the centre were, however,
tight-lipped about the studies being carried out.
According to sources in the council, 4 teams from the centre visited
Kottayam, Pathanamthitta, and Kollam districts and collected samples.
These were analysed for at least 8 viruses, including chikungunya and dengue.

[Dr. John commented, "Not new news, but it seems that there truly was
a huge outbreak and the language used most probably means high
prevalence of proven infection (my interpretation of high density)."]
[It is not clear if the chikungunya virus diagnosis was based on
serological tests, virus isolation, or demonstration of chikungunya
virus genome sequences by polymerase chain reaction. One assumes that
the term "heavy viral load" in Kerala also refers to incidence of infection.
