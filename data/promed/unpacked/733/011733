A South Australian aquaculture farm was placed under quarantine by
the State Government last night [8 Sep 2004] because of a serious
virus.
The virus pathogen -- known as _Barramundi nodavirus_ -- was detected
at a commercial breeding center. The virus affects larval and
juvenile fish, mainly via the brain and central nervous system.
The farm is run by a major SA aquaculture firm, which the Government
refused to name. A government spokesman said the virus did not pose
any risk to humans or native fish species.

[_Barramundi nodovirus_ is a small picorna-like virus that attacks
the central nervous system, especially the brain and retina. It most
often attacks 15 to 17-day-old larvae. The clinical signs of this
disease are uncoordinated darting, spiral or corkscrew swimming, pale
coloration, anorexia, and wasting. The disease has been named "viral
nervous necrosis" (VNN).
Hatcheries can control the disease by not recycling culture water,
chemical disinfection of influent water and larval tanks between
batches, and reduction of larval stocking densities. To decrease the
likelihood of this disease, stocking densities should not exceed 15
larvae per liter, and, generally, be less than 10 per liter. - Mod.TG]
