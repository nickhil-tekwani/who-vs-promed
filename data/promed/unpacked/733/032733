Outbreak of Rift Valley Fever in Yemen, August-October 2000
------------------------------------------------------------
On 17 Sep 2000, the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation (MAI) and
Ministry of Health (MOH) of Yemen received reports about the occurrence of
disease compatible with Rift Valley fever (RVF) in El Zuhrah district of
Hodeidah Governorate. Reports of animal disease included abortions and
deaths in young animals. Surveillance efforts by MOH and MAI documented
widespread disease among humans and animals in the area of Wadi Mawr in El
Zuhrah district, which is located on a coastal plain that extends from the
southern tip of Yemen into the Jizan area of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
(KSA). The Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health has described a simultaneous
outbreak of RVF in the Jizan area in KSA.
This report in MMWR [1 Dec 2000/49(47);1065-6
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr//preview/mmwrhtml/mm4947a3.htm> summarizes the
investigation of the Yemen outbreak. Because most patients in the outbreak
area do not seek health care in medical facilities, mobile surveillance
teams traveled to villages to interview case-patients or animal owners
about recent illness in the community. Initial case finding was focused
among villages in Wadi Mawr and was expanded to include areas throughout
the coastal plain. The WHO case definition for disease in humans was used.
During the period 7 Aug 2000 to 7 Nov 2000, 1087 suspected case-patients
were identified, including 121 (11%) persons who died. The mean age of
suspected case-patients was 32.2 years (range: 1 month to 95 years). The
clinical spectrum of disease was typical of that associated with RVF and
includes patients with hemorrhagic disease, encephalitis, retinitis, and
uncomplicated RVF. Of the 1087, 815 (75%) case-patients reported exposure
to sick animals, handling an abortus, or slaughtering animals in the week
before onset of illness. Of 490 case-patients with serologic testing, 136
(26%) had IgM-class antibody to RVF virus; 17 (3%) patients had weakly
reactive serologic test results. Serologically confirmed disease
transmission was detected in 15 districts throughout the coastal plain and
adjacent mountains.
To assess the extent of transmission in animals, cross-sectional surveys
were conducted in late September in diverse areas throughout Yemen. These
surveys detected a high prevalence of IgM-class antibody to RVF in numerous
areas in the northern part of the coastal plain and adjacent mountains.
Little evidence exists of RVF transmission south of Marawah. Since that
time, transmission has been detected in animals and humans in areas to the
south.
Editorial comment on this report reemphasized that the outbreak coincides
with an ongoing outbreak of RVF in the KSA that together represent the
first documented evidence of RVF virus transmission outside Africa. RNA
sequencing of the virus from KSA indicates that it is similar to the RVF
viruses isolated from East Africa in 1998. It is unclear whether there was
a recent introduction of RVF virus into the Arabian peninsula or the
emergence of an epidemic resulting from unique ecologic conditions. RVF
virus may have been introduced into Yemen in 1998 and environmental factors
may be promoting wide-scale disease occurrence. Satellite images and aerial
surveys reveal numerous areas throughout the coastal plain and adjacent
mountains that would be conducive for transmission of RVF virus. The
geographic distribution of disease hampered surveillance efforts and
presents a challenge for disease-control efforts. Outbreak-control measures
included vector-control (i.e., outdoor and indoor thermal fogging and
larviciding and residual house spraying), restricting animal movement,
preventing exposure to infected animals or abortuses through educational
campaigns, and upgrading local hospitals to optimize treatment of infected
patients. Entomologic studies are ongoing to evaluate and guide
vector-control operations. Impregnated mosquito bed nets also have been
distributed in the affected areas. Despite intensive vector-control
measures, transmission continues to occur in selected areas. The finding
that most patients had direct contact with infected animals emphasizes the
importance of health education to prevent transmission through this route.
Cross-sectional surveys are ongoing to evaluate the severity of disease and
to target and evaluate control efforts.
