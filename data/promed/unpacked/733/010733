Following the recent death of one horse stabled at Suffolk Downs, in East Boston, Massachusetts, from equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM), no horses are being allowed to leave the track, although no official quarantine has been imposed.

The affected horse died at the Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine's equine facility, in North Grafton, Massachusetts, after being transferred from the track.

One other horse at Suffolk Downs grounds has developed a fever. Samples drawn from that horse have been sent to the state laboratory for testing, and authorities are awaiting the results.

Jennifer Durenberger, DVM, the director of racing for the Massachusetts Gaming Commission, said the barn the affected horse resided in "is under enhanced biosecurity measures, and we are taking other special measures to protect the horse population."

At this time, horses can ship in to Suffolk Downs, but none can leave for any other track or farm. Furthermore, horses stabled in the same barn where the affected horse was housed are being isolated from the general population. Horses from Barn 21 can only train after regular hours when no others are on the track and cannot be entered to race.

After the case of EHM was diagnosed, Lorraine O'Connor, DVM, the chief veterinary health officer for the Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources, sent a letter to all horsemen outlining the clinical signs of the contagious disease, which can cause respiratory disease, severe illness, neurologic disease, and death.

Horsemen at the track are being asked to monitor their charges for fever, often the 1st clinical sign, by taking each horse's temperature twice daily. They are urged to report any fever or other signs of illness as delineated in the letter.

Chip Tuttle, COO (Chief Operating Officer) of Suffolk Downs, was not on track or available for comment [on 18 Jun 2014].

Durenberger said officials with the state department of agriculture, who are closely monitoring the situation, have been in contact with other racing jurisdictions where horses from Suffolk Downs might have already shipped.

[This disease can spread fairly fast. It is often recommended to take the animal's temperature at least twice a day to help catch an early rise, which may be the 1st sign of the disease. If there is a rise in resting temperature (1st thing in the morning, before the animals have begun to move around much), then it is advisable to contact your veterinarian immediately.

This disease is often abbreviated as EHV for equine herpesvirus or EHM for equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy.

Equine herpesvirus (EHV-1) infection in horses can cause respiratory and neurological disease, abortion in mares, and neonatal foal death. The neurological form of the disease is known as equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM) and has the potential to cause high morbidity and mortality.

EHV-1 is easily spread and typically has an incubation period between 2 and 10 days. Respiratory shedding of the virus generally occurs for 7-10 days but may persist longer in infected horses. For this reason, the isolation period recommendation for confirmed positive EHM cases is 21 days. Clinical signs of EHM in horses may include nasal discharge, incoordination, hindquarter weakness, recumbency, lethargy, urine dribbling, and diminished tail tone. The prognosis for EHM positive horses depends on the severity of signs and the period of recumbency. Employing supportive treatment with intravenous fluids, anti-inflammatory drugs, antiviral drugs, and other supportive measures may be beneficial, since there is no specific treatment for EHM.

Currently, no EHV-1 equine vaccine has a label claim for protection against the neurological strain of the virus.

This is a disease that has a profound effect on horses and owners. Horses have a very tough time recovering from this disease, and owners have a difficult time treating or euthanizing their pets/companions.

This disease is not to be toyed with. Owners should heed the words of the veterinarians. Enforce the rest and isolation of your horse. Protect your horse and other horses as well.
