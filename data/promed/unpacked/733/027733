After the chickens, is it the Mifi's residents' turn to be infected by H5N1? The prefect of the department has been seeking answers. During a meeting that he chaired on Friday, 8 Sep [2016] to raise the poultry farmers' awareness on the importance of respecting measures enacted by the governor of the West [Ouest] region to fight avian flu, the prefect received some news from the livestock, fishing and animal industry's delegate of the 3rd district of Bafoussam.

[The delegate] said that she was tipped off that several chickens died in a farm in the neighborhood of Tocket, belonging to a lady. Only when she visited this farm the next day, she got quite the surprise. The poultry farm was empty. All 600 chickens were gone. The neighbors revealed that the 3 children of the owner had the flu and a chronic cough. No one was at the house. The neighbors informed the delegate that the woman went to Yaounde with her sick children to consult a doctor. It was reported they got infected in Bafoussam and are now in Yaounde for treatment.

The authorities fear that the symptoms are the result of a transmission of H5N1 from poultry to humans, and that improper care could produce more infections. Joseph Tangwa Fover requested an investigation to find the woman and her sick children, in order to put them in quarantine, and identify the disease. Since last week the flu has made a comeback in the Mifi Department. On Friday, 8 Sep [2016], to fight the flu, the governor of the West region signed a decree containing the following measures: "ban on the sale of poultry in the markets in all of Mifi"; "ban on the movement of poultry, products and by-products entering or leaving Mifi"; "containment of identified households in a 10 km [about 6 mile] radius and strengthening of biosecurity measures."

The governor of the West region went one step further. He also ordered: "slaughter and incineration of all suspicious or infected birds within a 3 km [about 2 mile] radius and burial of carcasses"; "mandatory disinfection of all identified poultry farms and sites in a 3 km radius and observance of depopulation until further notice"; "application of practical advice issued by Minepia and/or the Ministry of Health to manage the crisis"; "all poultry sites to be inspected by veterinary services and health workers"; and finally evaluation on a regular basis of the "highly pathogenic avian influenza" infection.

[Based on information available from the above report, there is not enough epidemiological data on the suspected human cases, which could be flu-like illness resulting from seasonal flu. So we'll have to wait and see.

With the resurgence of avian flu in West Africa in December 2014 after nearly 7 years, H5N1 has quickly become entrenched in Cameroon, Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Niger, Togo, and Nigeria: http://afludiary.blogspot.com/2016/09/cameroon-unverified-media-reports-of.html.

In Cameroon, poultry outbreaks due to H5N1 were reported in May-June 2016 [http://www.voanews.com/a/h5n1-virus-resurfaces-claiming-40-thousand-birds/3358698.html].

While no human infections have been reported in West Africa since 2007, there are serious doubts whether the limited medical and surveillance resources in the region would pick up sporadic cases. Even in countries where they are actively looking for avian flu infections, the evidence suggests only a fraction are ever identified [http://afludiary.blogspot.com/2016/01/eid-journal-h5n1-in-egypt.html]. - Mod.UBA
