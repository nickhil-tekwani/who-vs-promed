Definition: Emergency Management Warning is an ongoing incident with
almost certain impact on APHIS.
Emergency Management Warning : Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease (Viral
Hemorrhagic Disease of Rabbits ) in Flushing, New York.
Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Confirmed in a Captive Exotic Animal
Facility in Flushing, New York.
On 1 & 2 Dec 2001, 2 of 6 rabbits on exhibit in the domestic animal
section at a captive exotic animal facility were found dead. There
were 2 additional rabbits in an off-exhibit area, for a total of 8
rabbits in the collection.
This is not considered a zoonotic disease [i.e. no danger to humans.
Animals were necropsied by zoo pathologists, and lesions consistent
with rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD) were found. Samples from the
dead rabbits were sent to the Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic
Laboratory (FADDL) on Plum Island, New York.
Test results were positive by hemagglutination on one rabbit and
negative on the other on 7 Dec 2001. A third exhibited rabbit died on
9 Dec 2001. The remaining rabbits were quarantined and isolated from
other animals. The 5 remaining rabbits were euthanized on 10 Dec 2001,
and additional samples will be sent to FADDL. Cleaning and
disinfection of the area will be done.
From the epidemiological data gathered so far, the source of the virus
is unknown.
APHIS, Veterinary Services (VS), the State Department of Agriculture
of New York, and facility managers are working together to address
this situation. VS will assist the affected State in the depopulation
and cleaning and disinfecting of the premises. VS will also
investigate reports of suspect RHD as part of its foreign animal
disease surveillance program and will continue to diagnose suspect
cases at FADDL.
