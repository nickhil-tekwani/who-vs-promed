Update on the outbreak of legionnaires' disease in Murcia, Spain
-----------------------------------------------
Between the end of June and the first few days of July [2001 a very
large and explosive outbreak of legionnaires' disease occurred in
Murcia, a Spanish city of 360 000 people (1). As of 18 July [2001 a
total of 745 cases of pneumonia had been diagnosed, of which 315 have
been confirmed as legionnaires disease by detection of legionella
antigen in urine. Dates of onset of illness of confirmed cases ranged
from 26 June to 16 July [2001, with a peak on 5-6 July. From 6 July
the incidence declined rapidly. One death has been reported in a case
in which _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1 has been isolated. A
total of 12 cases were admitted to intensive care units. Seventy-six
per cent of cases were male, and about two thirds of cases were aged
over 50 years.
Nearly 70% of all cases lived in a small area to the north and
northwest of the city centre. Preliminary information from patient
interviews indicated that the other cases had visited the city centre
in the last week of June or the first few days of July [2001. The
likely source of infection for the outbreak is a cooling tower in the
city centre. Several cooling towers in that area were positive by PCR
but no _L. pneumophila_ sg1 have so far been isolated. Control
measures have been applied to this and all other cooling towers in the
vicinity, and also to other potential sources of infection in the
area.
Murcia is the host city for this years European Youth Olympic Days,
to be held from 22-27 July. Because of concern for the health of the
several thousand sports people and other visitors due to arrive in
Murcia, the European Olympic Committee (EOC) arranged for an
international group of legionella experts to visit Murcia between
11-15 July to assess rapidly the impact of the outbreak and discuss
control measures with the local public health team. The international
group were a total of five epidemiologists and microbiologists, two
from the UK Public Health Laboratory Service, one from the Netherlands
National Institute of Public Health and one each from the National
Centres of Epidemiology and Microbiology in Spain. All are national
representatives in the European Surveillance Scheme for Travel
Associated Legionnaires Disease and members of the European Working
Group for Legionella Infections <http://www.ewgli.org/>.
They concluded that the local health authorities had taken rapid steps
to investigate and control the outbreak, and had implemented
appropriate control measures to prevent the occurrence of further
cases. The outbreak now seems to be over. On the basis of these
findings, the international group recommended to the EOC and to the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) that the games should continue.
The IOC accepted the recommendation, and the games are to go ahead as
planned.
Comment
This seems to be the worlds largest outbreak of legionnaires' disease
since the disease was first recognised in 1976. Remarkably, only one
death is associated with this outbreak, which may be due in part to
the fast diagnosis and adequate treatment of the patients concerned.
Another very large outbreak, the Melbourne aquarium outbreak of 2000
(2), was also recognised early and showed a case fatality rate of less
than 2% (3). Moreover, in Australia and Spain, many pneumonia patients
are treated empirically with antibiotics that have activity against
legionella. In contrast, the Dutch flower show outbreak of 1999 (4,5)
was only recognised when a large majority of the cases were already
ill and in that outbreak the case fatality rate was 11% (6). Empirical
therapy for pneumonia in the Netherlands is with beta-lactam
antibiotics rather than macrolides. Other factors may also have
contributed to the absence of deaths in the Murcia outbreak. The
legionella strain may have been less virulent, and patients may have
had prior exposure to this strain.
