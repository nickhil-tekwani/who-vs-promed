On 7 Apr 2010, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service
(APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) confirmed the
identification of Citrus Black Spot (_Guignardia citricarpa_; CBS) on
citrus fruit from Collier County, Florida. The CBS-infected fruit
samples were collected from commercial Valencia orange groves. This
is the 1st confirmation of CBS in the United States.

The initial identification was made by the Florida Department of
Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS), Department of Plant
Industry (DPI) on 25 Mar 2010. The identification was made as a
result of a routine Citrus Health Response Program (CHRP) survey at
the grower's request. Following the preliminary determination by
FDACS that the fruit was infected with CBS, APHIS and FDACS personnel
revisited the property and collected symptomatic fruit that was sent
to the APHIS laboratory in Beltsville for confirmatory testing.

The commercial citrus groves where CBS was confirmed produces fruit
for juicing. An Emergency Action Notification has been issued
requiring that the fruit be shipped to local processing plants under
tarpaulin or within closed vehicles to prevent spread of CBS. A
compliance agreement has been implemented to ensure appropriate
cleaning of the conveyance and approved procedures for the disposal
of debris. No fruit from the affected groves was shipped out of
Florida.

To date, CBS has not been detected in other parts of Florida through
multi-pest surveys conducted by FDACS DPI as part of the Federal CHRP
Program. APHIS and FDACS DPI continue to delimit the area to
determine the extent of the infestation and are implementing the
necessary phytosanitary procedures to prevent the spread of CBS from
the infested orchard.

[Black spot caused by the fungus _Guignardia citricarpa_ is one of
the most serious citrus diseases in Asia and regions of the southern
hemisphere. Symptoms can occur on leaves but are most severe on
fruit. They include sunken lesions of varying size, shape and colour
depending on stage of fruit or leaf development. The disease may also
lead to post-harvest losses since fruit may not show visible symptoms
yet while on the tree. However, characteristic lesions may develop in
storage under suitable conditions. Fungal strains which do not cause
symptoms also exist. Black spot causes significant losses due to
premature fruit and leaf drop and disfiguration of fruit for fresh
markets.

Spores are produced under fallen leaves and sometimes on fruit.
Spread occurs by air currents, on contaminated plant material
(including nursery plants or scions with latent infections) and by
mechanical means. The disease is particularly virulent late in the
season, and losses tend to be most severe in late maturing varieties.
All commercial citrus cultivars are susceptible to varying extents,
except for sour orange (_Citrus aurantium_). Diseases management
includes fungicides, phytosanitation and pathogen exclusion.

Transport and processing of fruit from contaminated orchards (rather
than burning and burying of all plant material on site), even under
the regulations described above, appears risky since the escape of a
single spore may lead to further infections and establishment of the
pathogen in the region.
