Open drains, garbage scattered everywhere, bad roads, no drinking
water facility, and now viral fever, these have added to the
unhygienic condition of citizens of the Silicon City.

For the past month, 350-500 patients have been visiting
Kadogondanahalli Primary Health Centre (PHC) every day for viral
fever and chikungunya check-ups. Even the staff are affected by the
diseases.

With no proper place to treat patients due to the ongoing
construction of the Community Health Centre (CHC), patients are
treated in dilapidated staff quarters. Even the PHC staff has no
place to sit.

The health centre's only pharmacist has just returned after a bout of
chikungunya. Out of 3 "group D" employees, one of them who had been
working for 18 years in the PHC recently died after complaining of
fever, and another recovered from a week-long viral fever.

There has been a regular flow of patients from Venkateshpura, D J
Halli, K G Halli, Nagawara, Kavalbyrsandra, Hegdenagar and
Govindapura.

Short of staff with just 2 doctors and a nurse deputed from Ghousia
Hospital, the place continues to treat patients in an unhygienic
environment.

The radiologist has been deputed to Raj Bhavan for want of equipment
at the centre. The junior health assistant and field staff posts have
not been filled up.

At the health centre, a man who has suffered from chikungunya for the
past 2 months said: "More than 60 percent of the people are suffering
from viral fever and chikungunya because of the unhygienic conditions
here. We lack even a basic facility like a public bathroom, due to
which even the campus is littered."

Fortunately, another resident said 3 private organizations held a
camp and distributed medicine to 3000 patients recently.

Residents of Rashadnagar said they have not received drinking water
for the past 6 months. "Holding health camps and distributing
medicine or fogging are not the solutions. With no drinking water
facility, how are we going to live?" a resident asked.

[This report does not indicate if any of these indicated chikungunya
virus infections have been laboratory confirmed. There is no
indication of what the etiology of the "viral fever" cases mentioned
in this report might be. Dengue virus infection is one of many
possibilities. ProMED would appreciate receiving information about
laboratory results that would support a diagnosis of chikungunya or
other virus infections that might be involved in the current
situation. Lack of a reliable water system usually results in water
storage in homes and other buildings, providing breeding places for
_Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes, the vector for chikungunya and dengue
viruses.
