A two-year-old Newcastle boy [has] died of a rare complication of food
poisoning.
[For some time] an investigation into a cluster of cases [of hemolytic
uremic syndrome] in the greater Sydney area was already under way. Early
tests suggest that contaminated minced beef may be the culprit.
The September 1999 issue of the NSW Health Department's Public Health
Bulletin describes seven (non-fatal) cases in the State between 1 Jan 1999
and 15 Apr 1999, compared with five cases in the whole of 1998 and only one
case in 1997.
Since April 15 there have been two more cases of HUS in the Hunter region
alone, including [the boy].
Following [the boy's] death on 18 Oct 1999, the Hunter Public Health Unit
has issued its own warning to local general practitioners, urging them to
do stool tests on patients with bloody diarrhoea. It also urges tests on
those with persistent diarrhoea and high temperature, and in cases where
two or more people have become ill from sharing a meal.
The Newcastle boy's parents believe that his death may be linked to a
"meat-lover's" pizza which they say made their entire family and two
visitors sick. (HUS is usually contracted by eating beef contaminated with
cattle faeces.)
According to the Public Health Bulletin, an investigation into seven cases
between January 1 and April 15 has revealed that the only common factor in
all but one of the Sydney cases was that the patients ate minced beef
within 12 days before falling sick.
In Australia's only major recorded outbreak of HUS - the notorious
Garibaldi case in South Australia in 1995 - the disease was linked to
contaminated mettwurst.
An investigation by the Hunter Public Health Unit has been unable to
identify any definite cause in the [present] case.
The area health service says between 2500 and 7500 cases of gastroenteritis
occur in the Hunter each week and conducting stool samples on each would be
next to impossible. However, the November edition of the Hunter Area Health
Service public
health bulletin warns GPs that cases of "diarrhoea and vomiting in two or
more cases that shared a common meal" should be stool-tested for HUS.
