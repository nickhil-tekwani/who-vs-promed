Nearly 150 patients exposed to potentially contaminated steroid injections in Tennessee received medicine more than 7 weeks old, even though industry guidelines say its shelf life should have been no longer than 24 hours. Almost 1 in 5 of those patients developed a fungal infection -- a rate dramatically higher than for those treated with fresher medicine, according to the Tennessee Department of Health. The methylprenisolone acetate produced by Massachusetts-based New England Compounding Center is blamed in a nationwide outbreak of fungal meningitis that has sickened 424 people and killed 31 in 19 states.

Under best-practice guidelines from the U.S. Pharmacopeia Convention, the drug would be considered a "high-risk" product -- made from nonsterile ingredients and lacking antimicrobial preservatives. In the absence of a sterility test, storage time should not exceed one day at room temperature or 3 days at a cold temperature, the guidelines say.

In Tennessee, the compounding center's vials were stored at room temperature, as specified in the package instructions, state health officials said in a paper published Tue 6 Nov 2012 [online] in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).

The compounding laboratory claimed to have performed sterility tests on its products, but the Massachusetts Board of Pharmacy has said that testing was inadequate and shipments were made before the safety of medicines had been verified.

The preservative-free steroid should never have been produced en masse to begin with, said Loyd V. Allen Jr., editor-in-chief of the International Journal of Pharmaceutical Compounding. "If it is not preserved -- if it is only intended to be used in one patient -- then it has to be packaged in a single-use container and its contents have to be used all at one time," Allen said. "If it is going to be used on multiple patients or at multiple times, then it has to have a preservative."

New England Compounding Center violated its license by mass-producing drugs without prescriptions for individual patients, according to officials with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Massachusetts Board of Pharmacy. The company shipped
17 676 units of preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate that have been linked to the outbreak. A sterility test should be conducted for any batch larger than 25 units, Allen said.

The state health department's analysis of infection cases in Tennessee found that patients treated with medicine packaged longer than 50 days had a 19 percent infection rate while those treated with newer vials had only a 3 percent infection rate.

"We found a strong association between the age of methylprednisolone vials and the rate of infection in one clinic," the physicians wrote. "One possible explanation for this observation is that the level of contamination in the vials may have increased over time with subsequent higher fungal burdens present in older vials."

The article does not identify the clinic by name but does note that the clinic had used 1663 vials of the medicine. The only one of the 3 clinics in Tennessee that had that much product, according to prior information from the state health department, was St. Thomas Outpatient Neurosurgery Center.

However, Allen said the responsibility for providing guidance on shelf life rests with the drug manufacturer or compounding lab. The best-practice standards do allow compounding labs to recommend usage for up to 6 months if certain criteria, including a program for sterility testing, are met.

Dr. Michael A. Carome, deputy director of health research for Public Citizen, said the medical journal article is further proof that New England Compounding violated its license. Public Citizen is a non-profit that advocates for public safety.

"Had each dose of the drug been prepared on demand and as needed for individual patients consistent with the traditionally narrow scope of a compounding pharmacy, then each dose -- even if contaminated -- likely would have been used very soon after production, thus minimizing the risk to the patient because there would have been less time for the fungus to grow and multiply."

[The results section of the abstract of the study, Kainer MA, Reagan DR, Nguyen DB, et al: Fungal infections associated with contaminated methylprednisolone in Tennessee http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1212972 is shown below:

The median age of the 66 case patients was 69 years (range, 23 to 91). The median time from the last epidural glucocorticoid injection to symptom onset was 18 days (range, 0 to 56). Patients presented with meningitis alone (73 percent), the cauda equina syndrome or focal infection (15 percent), or posterior circulation stroke with or without meningitis (12 percent). Symptoms and signs included headache (in 73 percent of the patients), new or worsening back pain (in 50 percent), neurologic symptoms (in 48 percent), nausea (in 39 percent), and stiff neck (in 29 percent). The median cerebrospinal fluid white-cell count on the 1st lumbar puncture among patients who presented with meningitis, with or without stroke or focal infection, was 648 per cubic millimeter (range, 6 to 10 140), with 78 percent granulocytes (range, 0 to 97); the protein level was 114 mg per deciliter (range, 29 to 440); and the glucose concentration was 44 mg per deciliter (range, 12 to 121) (2.5 mmol per liter [range, 0.7 to 6.7]). A total of 22 patients had laboratory confirmation of _Exserohilum rostratum_ infection (21 patients) or _Aspergillus fumigatus_ infection (1 patient). The risk of infection increased with exposure to lot 06292012@26, older vials, higher doses, multiple procedures, and translaminar approach to epidural glucocorticoid injection. Voriconazole was used to treat 61 patients (92 percent); 35 patients (53 percent) were also treated with liposomal amphotericin B. 8 patients (12 percent) died, 7 of whom had stroke. - Mod.LL]

Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rules are often forged in crisis. After the 1937 sulfanilamide disaster that killed more than 100 people, Congress passed the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), requiring drugs to be safe and properly labeled. In 1962, a requirement was introduced for proof of drug efficacy through "adequate and well-controlled investigations," partly in response to the thalidomide tragedy. Rules protecting human-research subjects owe a debt to Tuskegee and Nuremberg. Sometimes it takes a disaster to spur the adoption of appropriate regulation.

Today, compounding pharmacies are at the center of a controversy after a rare outbreak of fungal meningitis that was traced to several lots of the injectable glucocorticoid methylprednisolone acetate compounded by the New England Compounding Center (NECC). Congress is already discussing new federal regulations.

Since 1938, the FDA has had clear authority to regulate drug manufacturing, but compounding falls into a gray area between state and federal oversight. The FDA's authority here is generally limited to reacting to problems identified by others. Traditional compounding pharmacies are not registered with the FDA as drug manufacturers, the agency doesn't approve their prescriptions before marketing, and related adverse events need not be reported to the FDA. State law generally controls record keeping, certifications, and licensing for compounding pharmacies.

Such a regulatory structure is not unusual: many US health care laws embrace federalism principles, preserving substantial realms for state control. States have primary authority over the practice of both medicine and pharmacy. But over time, compounding has evolved into a business far removed from the mortar and pestle. Once it becomes an industrial-scale national business, the arguments for federal regulation become stronger.

For more than 2 decades, the FDA has struggled to regulate industrial-scale compounding. In 1992, it issued a Compliance Policy Guide, attempting to police the line between traditional compounding and drug manufacturing. This guide attracted enough criticism that Congress created a safe-harbor compounding statute in 1997, amending the FDCA with a new section, 503A.

But 2 days before this law was to take effect, 7 compounding pharmacies sued to block it. Section 503A(c) banned the advertising and promotion of compounded drugs; the theory was that since traditional compounding occurred in response to individual prescriptions, advertising was unnecessary. The advertising ban was the law's Achilles' heel. In 2002, in a 5-to-4 decision in Thompson v. Western States Medical Center (an early example of the use of free speech against public health regulation), the Supreme Court ruled that compounders have a constitutional right to advertise their drugs.

The FDA salvaged the Compliance Policy Guide by reissuing it without the advertising and interstate-shipment provisions, reemphasizing the agency's authority under the FDCA. The 2002 Guide articulated 9 factors that the FDA would consider as relevant, including many drawn from the non-advertising provisions of Section 503A. Several of these factors appear to have been violated by NECC.

Some observers have chastised the FDA for not acting sooner against NECC, given the agency's authority to block illegal drug manufacturing. But this critique ignores the complex regulatory history. FDA authority over compounding has never been straightforward, and though the agency can react once a problem is obvious, it's unclear how it should proactively gather information on potential violations before a crisis erupts. The thousands of US compounding pharmacies are not registered with the FDA; they are not subject to federal record keeping and reporting rules for drug manufacturers; and, through litigation, the FDA can be blocked for many months from visiting them. Without information about the actual conditions in compounding pharmacies, regulators cannot act to address violations.

It's possible that if the Supreme Court hadn't struck down Section 503A, the tragedy at NECC could have been averted. Several features of that law are relevant.

First, traditional compounding was limited to a pharmacist or a physician serving a specific patient. Section 503A also permitted compounding of drugs "in limited quantities before the receipt of a valid prescription order . . . based on a history of . . . receiving valid prescription orders." According to the preliminary report from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, NECC far exceeded these limits in preparing and shipping vials of methylprednisolone acetate. Once disconnected from individual patients, compounding increasingly resembles drug manufacturing.

Second, compounding is not needed if a drug is commercially available from an FDA-regulated facility. Section 503A prohibited compounding "regularly or in inordinate amounts" any drugs that were "essentially copies of a commercially available drug product." FDA-approved methylprednisolone acetate is sold by Pfizer and 2 generics companies, but since NECC's version did not contain preservatives, it could sidestep this regulatory process -- with tragic results.

Third, Congress recognized that states could effectively regulate traditional compounding pharmacies, but national-scale businesses required federal coordination. Section 503A provided a test for distinguishing between the 2: it limited interstate shipments to no more than 5 percent of the compounder's business, unless the home state had entered into a "memorandum of understanding" with the FDA, bolstering state and federal cooperation. NECC shipped substantial quantities of drugs to many states. If Section 503A had not been struck down, both the FDA and Massachusetts would have been more directly involved in regulating NECC for more than a decade.

Yet contamination is only one of 5 categories of risk associated with compounding pharmacies; the others are subpotency, superpotency, overmedication, and medication replacement. Other policy levers that may be needed include enhanced transparency for state-level regulation, mandatory disclosures to physicians and patients, mandatory reporting of adverse events, user fees to support oversight, clear FDA authority to register and inspect nontraditional compounding pharmacies, enhanced incentives for internal whistle blowers, and modification of reimbursement rules to blunt the economic incentives driving industrial-scale compounding.

Fungal contamination at NECC has sickened more than 400 patients and killed at least 29. But it's important to note that many patients received these sterile injections for back and joint pain, a procedure that lacks high-quality evidence of efficacy. These problems cannot be laid entirely at the feet of compounders when clinicians persist in clinical practices despite weak evidence of efficacy.

[4] CDC Consultation Network service
Date: Mon 5 Nov 2012

http://www.infectioncontroltoday.com/news/2012/11/cdc-launches-clinician-consultation-service-for-fungal-meningitis-cases.aspx


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has launched a new email and telephone-based Clinicians Consultation Network service to assist clinicians treating patients who received injections with the contaminated steroid medication. In addition, the CDC is alerting clinicians of 2 unusual clinical complications, epidural abscess and arachnoiditis, among a portion of patients undergoing treatment for meningitis associated with injections of a contaminated steroid medication, preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate.

Beginning on 6 Nov 2012, the CDC is establishing a volunteer Clinicians Consultation Network of experts in fungal disease treatment and management to assist physicians who are directly involved in the treatment of patients associated with the current outbreak of fungal meningitis and other infections. Through this service, doctors who are treating patients will be able to consult by telephone or e-mail with one of a group of participating infectious disease medical experts. To access the service, physicians should call 1-800-CDC-INFO (1-800-232-4636) and then select the appropriate prompts (e.g., "1" for English, "1" for Clinician). A CDC-INFO call agent will verify each physician's role in direct patient management. After this verification, the calling physician will be referred to the Clinicians Consultation Network. The Network consultants have entered into volunteer agreements with the CDC to provide this consultation service to treating physicians. There is no charge for the consultation. The consultants will report their findings to the CDC, which may provide valuable information for the response to the outbreak. Operating hours for the service are the same as those for CDC-INFO: 8:00 am to 8:00 pm Monday through Friday ET, except federal holidays. For questions about the Clinicians Consultation Network, contact CDC-INFO (1-800-232-4636).

During the course of this investigation, the CDC has worked closely with a group of fungal infectious disease experts who provided their individual input to help the CDC develop interim guidance and other information about clinical aspects of the outbreak, including patient management and treatment. The guidance documents have been updated regularly as the CDC and its partners have learned more about the outbreak; the latest versions are available on the CDC's outbreak-related Clinician Guidance web page at: http://www.cdc.gov/hai/outbreaks/clinicians/index.html.

The CDC has also advised that health care providers involved in the treatment of these patients consult with an infectious disease medical specialist because of the diagnostic and clinical challenges presented by these fungal infections. The CDC has recently become aware of reports of epidural abscess and arachnoiditis among a number of patients undergoing treatment for fungal meningitis associated with injections of contaminated steroid. Spinal epidural abscesses are characterized by inflammation and a collection of pus around the spine, sometimes resulting in swelling of the infected areas (though several recently reported patients with this condition had no detectable swelling). Arachnoiditis is caused by inflammation of the arachnoid, one of the membranes that surround and protect the nerves of the spinal cord. Both conditions are normally rare but serious disorders that require prompt medical attention. Most of these early reports have been for patients in Michigan and Tennessee, but other states have reported patients with these conditions as well. The CDC is working with clinicians and public health officials to obtain more information and refine its clinical guidance as needed.

For additional information about the outbreak of fungal meningitis and other infections, see the CDC's website at: http://www.cdc.gov/hai/outbreaks/meningitis.html.

[The number of cases continues to rise but a somewhat lower slope. The recognition, found in the above NEJM paper from Tennessee, that older vials are more likely to transmit the fungal pathogen is not surprising since there is no preservative and the vials were kept at room temperature. The legal perspective report, also from NEJM, adds an interesting facet for clinicians regarding the FDA.

Sulfanilamide disaster
----------------------
The 1937 sulfanilamide disaster mentioned above is summarized below http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/WhatWeDo/History/ProductRegulation/SulfanilamideDisaster/default.htm:

"The medicine....was Elixir Sulfanilamide. During September and October 1937 this drug was responsible for the deaths of more than 100 people in 15 states, as far east as Virginia and as far west as California. The drug and the deaths led to the passage of the 1938 Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which increased FDA's authority to regulate drugs.

Sulfanilamide, a drug used to treat streptococcal infections, had been shown to have dramatic curative effects and had been used safely for some time in tablet and powder form. In June 1937, however, a salesman for the S.E. Massengill Co., in Bristol, Tenn., reported a demand in the southern states for the drug in liquid form. The company's chief chemist and pharmacist, Harold Cole Watkins, experimented and found that sulfanilamide would dissolve in diethylene glycol. The company control lab tested the mixture for flavor, appearance, and fragrance and found it satisfactory. Immediately, the company compounded a quantity of the elixir and sent shipments - 633 of them - all over the country.

The new formulation had not been tested for toxicity. At the time the food and drugs law did not require that safety studies be done on new drugs. Selling toxic drugs was, undoubtedly, bad for business and could damage a firm's reputation, but it was not illegal.

Because no pharmacological studies had been done on the new sulfanilamide preparation, Watkins failed to note one characteristic of the solution. Diethylene glycol, a chemical normally used as an antifreeze, is a deadly poison."
