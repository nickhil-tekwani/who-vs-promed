Ohio Meat Supplier Recalls Ground Beef
----------------------------------------
A food processing company is voluntarily recalling about 106 000 pounds of
ground beef, and federal officials are testing whether the meat could be
responsible for _E. coli_ infections in 3 Ohio children.
American Foods Group said the beef was processed 24 Jan 2003 at its
Sharonville plant and was carried by the Kroger and Meijer chains. None of
the beef is currently in stores.
The children became ill in early February 2003, all with the same strain of
the bacteria, said Kristopher Weiss, spokesman for the Ohio Department of
Health. Officials said Wednesday that while bacteria had been found in the
recalled beef, it was still being tested to determine whether it caused the
children's illnesses.
The beef was sold from 25 Jan through 3 Feb 2003 at Kroger stores in Ohio,
Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, North Carolina, Tennessee,
Virginia, and West Virginia; and Meijer stores in Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,
Michigan, and Kentucky.
Kroger sold the beef in trays and as hamburger patties with the code
numbers 3024 and 3025 below the store logo. The Meijer brand ground chuck
was sold in 1-pound trays with the code number 3024 below the UPC bar code.
Consumers with questions can call American Foods at 1-800-829-2838.

[It remains important to stress that adequate household handling and
cooking of the meat will prevent any transmission of this potentially
lethal infection. More information is necessary to establish a link
between the Ohio cases and the beef being recalled. - Mod.LL]
