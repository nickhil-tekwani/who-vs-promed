The Ministry of Health of Egypt has announced 4 new cases of human
H5N1 avian influenza infection. The cases are not linked epidemiologically.

The 1st case is a 20-year-old female from Baniswief governorate. She
developed symptoms on 6 Jan 2010 and was hospitalized on 11 Jan 2010,
where she received oseltamivir treatment [previously reported as the
91st case in ProMED-mail: Avian influenza, human (04): Egypt, 91st
case 20100120.0227].

The 2nd case is a one-year-old male from Dakahalya governorate. He
developed symptoms on 7 Jan 2010 and was hospitalized on 12 Jan 2010,
where he received oseltamivir treatment [previously reported as the
92nd case in ProMED-mail: Avian influenza, human (05): Egypt, 92nd -
94th cases 20100127.0294].

The 3rd case is a 3-year-old male from Assuit governorate. He
developed symptoms on 19 Jan 2010 and was hospitalized on 21 Jan
2010, where he received oseltamivir treatment [previously reported as
the 93rd case in ProMED-mail: Avian influenza, human (05): Egypt,
92nd - 94th cases 20100127.0294].

The 4th case is a 45-year-old male from Shargea governorate. He
developed symptoms on 12 Jan 2010 and was hospitalized on 19 Jan
2010, where he received oseltamivir treatment [previously reported as
the 94th case in ProMED-mail: Avian influenza, human (05): Egypt,
92nd - 94th cases 20100127.0294].

All 4 are currently in a stable condition in hospital. Investigations
into the source of infection indicated that all 4 cases had exposure
to sick and dead poultry.

The cases were confirmed by the Egyptian Central Public Health
Laboratories, a National Influenza Center of the WHO Global Influenza
Surveillance Network (GISN).

Of the 94 laboratory confirmed cases of avian influenza A(H5N1)
reported in Egypt, 27 have been fatal [However, only 4 of the 43
human cases of avian influenza recorded in Egypt since the beginning
of 2009 have been fatal. - Mod.CP].
