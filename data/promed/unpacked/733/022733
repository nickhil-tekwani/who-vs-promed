[This is now the 4rd consecutive week with no WPV1 isolates globally, neither in AFP cases nor from environmental samples. As mentioned in the previous update: "It is possible that after 2 years (2019 and 2021) of high circulation, there is a herd immunity among the population slowing down transmission. Time will tell as a new population of potential susceptibles are born and may create new pockets; or possibly transmission has been interrupted." (see Poliomyelitis update (07): global, Sierra Leone, Kenya, Somalia, WHO 20210527.8382587)

That being said, cases associated with the vaccine (cVDPVs - circulating vaccine derived polioviruses) are the only AFP (acute flaccid paralysis) cases identified in the past 4 weeks. It took the USA 20 years from the identification of the vaccine as the key problem to switching to IPV (inactivated poliovirus vaccine)... can we afford to wait that long? - Mod.MPP]

[2] Afghanistan - vaccination challenges
Date: Thu 3 Jun 2021
Source: The Telegraph [edited]
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/third-afghan-children-go-without-polio-drops-thanks-talibans/


A long-running Taliban ban on door-to-door polio vaccination teams means that 1-in-3 Afghan children are still not getting polio drops, creating a vulnerable pool of millions where the virus could run riot. Three years after the militants banned house-to-house health teams operating in their territory, the edict remains in force and means around 3.4 million under-5 are missed in each vaccination drive.

The lack of access has become the biggest problem for the long-running global campaign to stamp out the crippling poliovirus. The campaign is also having to navigate a patchwork of territorial control and shifting front lines, as foreign troops leave Afghanistan and fighting intensifies.

Hopes that the Taliban would allow vaccinators to at least administer drops at central sites under their control, such as in local mosques, have so far not been realised.

The Taliban's military leadership enacted the ban on door-to-door vaccination teams in May 2018 after alleging health workers were spies gathering intelligence for air strikes and special forces raids. The insurgents claimed commanders had been targeted shortly after their areas had been visited by vaccination teams.

The ban largely affects southern and eastern Afghanistan, and means that while the campaign tries to reach 10 million children during every national vaccination sweep, currently some 3.4 million are being missed. Assurances that the Afghan polio campaign is purely medical have not changed the insurgents' minds.

Godwin Mindra, acting polio chief for Unicef in Afghanistan, said the door-to-door approach was the mainstay of polio vaccination and enabled teams to reach more children. "The reason we do house-to-house campaigns is we can follow these kids very closely, we can go to homes with newborns, we can go to homes where there are sick kids who are not able to go to a health facility, we can go to homes where there are visiting children," he told the Telegraph. He went on: "Unfortunately, in areas where we have had bans by the Taliban, since May of 2018, these kids have repeatedly not received the polio vaccine. That means their immunity to the virus has lowered. "For every 3 children we are targeting, we are missing one. That's significant and if we continue with the critical mass of children who are missed, we have a risk that it will be hard for us to eliminate in terms of getting the virus circulation stopped," he said.

Preliminary figures from the most recent campaign in March [2021] showed the number of children out of reach was rising, he said. Months of negotiation with the Taliban leadership have yet to remove the block. International bodies including the United Nations children's body, Unicef, have met leaders from the Taliban's Doha political office.

Last year hopes were raised that the militants would allow teams to vaccinate at central points in Taliban territory, but the final go-ahead has not yet been given. Epidemiologists say such a campaign, where babies and toddlers would for example be taken to the local mosque, would reach more children, but still not enough to eradicate poliovirus.

An effective mosque-to-mosque campaign may reach around 5-fifths of children, but levels must reach closer to 95% to stamp out the poliovirus. A Taliban figure familiar with the negotiations told the Telegraph that they did not trust the polio vaccination teams, who were suspected of using smartphones to gather information and asking questions unrelated to polio. Another senior Taliban figure said: "At the movement no decision has been made. The polio door to door campaign has been absolutely banded by top leadership."

Dr Mohammad Rashidi, Afghanistan's national polio coordinator, said: "The problem has been the same for 3 years, there has been a ban on house-to-house vaccinations in the south and east. Right now through our international partners we are trying to get in contact with them and with local community leaders that they should allow us. We are in negotiations."

Afghanistan and neighbouring Pakistan are the only 2 countries where the wild strain of the poliovirus remains endemic.

A 3-decade-long worldwide campaign to stamp out the childhood scourge has come tantalisingly close to ending a disease which caused 350 000 cases per year in the late 1980s. Afghanistan suffered 56 cases in 2020 and Pakistan suffered 84.

[If the estimate of 3.4 million susceptibles are missed for polio vaccination, there will be a rapid accrual of susceptibles for a cVDPV to continue circulating, and the WPV if in fact it is still silently circulating in the country.

It's a global shame that politics have greatly influenced vaccination programs either through interfering with logistics of vaccine administration or interfering with vaccine acceptance through spreading fake news about the vaccination efforts or the vaccine itself. Polio eradication has suffered as a result of this, as has measles elimination and now COVID-19 control is facing the same challenges. - Mod.MPP
