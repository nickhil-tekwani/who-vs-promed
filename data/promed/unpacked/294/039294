The following information was provided by Mr. Diego Rojas, Animal scientist and Epidemiologist, Area Director, Classical Swine Fever (CSF) Eradication, Colombia Pork Producers Association; Dr. M. del Pilar Pineda, Epidemiologist, Risk Analysis Unit, Colombia Pork Producers Association; and Dr. Alvaro Gonzalez Rubio, Epidemiologist, Agriculture and Livestock Services in Chile, in response to ProMED mail post "Classical swine fever - Colombia: porcine, spread, OIE, request for information 20140623.2539174:"

Situation in Venezuela
-----------------------
CSF has occurred in Venezuela since 1941 and is considered to be endemic in that country. Venezuela started with a program to eradicate CSF in October 1998 (Resolution 564 published in the Official Gazzete No 36.551). CSF is a disease which is required (mandatory) to be reported in Venezuela.

The official animal health laboratory in Venezuela (CENIAP/INIA) conducts routine diagnostic tests for CSF on all submitted samples. The tests conducted are the direct immunofluorescent test (official test), ELISA, virus isolation, and PCR. Samples tested include serum, tonsils and epithelia.

The following outbreaks were reported by year: 2000, 2 outbreaks; 2001, no outbreaks, 2002, 3 outbreaks, and in 2003, 4 outbreaks. Through June 2004, 3 outbreaks were reported in Aragua and Carabobo.

Between 2008 and 2012, the National Institute of Agricultural Research received 1122 samples, all of which were negative for CSF. Since 2005, Venezuela has not reported any CSF. The last report sent by Venezuela to the OIE indicates that the last outbreak of CSF was in September 2005, which affected 50 animals in a herd of 940 pigs. There were 25 deaths associated with that event.

Vaccination against CSF is mandatory in Venezuela. Approved vaccines include the use of attenuated live products, which have been shown to be very effective when used systematically and extensively. There are 4 vaccines approved for use in Venezuela.

Situation in Colombia
--------------------
The public (Instituto Colombiano Agropecuario - ICA) and private sectors, particularly under the leadership of the Colombian Pork Producer's Association (Asoporcicultores), have made significant advances with the program to eradicate CSF, recognizing several free zones in the country. In 2009 and 2010, the 1st zones (Zones 1 and 2, which comprise the departments of Amazonas, Choco north, San Andres and Providencia, Vichada, Guainia, Guaviare, Vaupes and the municipality of Puerto Concordia- Meta) were recognized as CSF free.

In 2011, the main pork production zone in the country, where 70 percent of the commercial production occurs and which includes the departments of Antioquia (not including Magdalena Medio, Uraba and Bajo Cauca Antioquenos), the central zone (Choco south, Valle del Cauca, Norte del Cauca, Caldas (not including Magdalena Medio Caldense), Quindio, Risaralda and the municipality of Cajamarca-Tolima (Zone 3), were declared free of CSF.

In 2013, ICA prohibited vaccination against CSF in Zone 4 (Departments of Atlantico, Boyaca, Bolivar, Caqueta, Cauca, Cesar, Cordoba, Cundinamarca, Huila, Meta, Magdalena, Santander, Sucre, Tolima and the southern zone of Casanare). Thus, Zone 4 joins Zones 1, 2 and 3 as free of CSF.

Between 26 Aug 2013 and 5 Apr 2014, ICA officially reported 8 outbreaks of CSF in the country. These events involved 2102 animals, with 514 (24.45 percent) clinical cases, and of these, 486 animals (94.55 percent) died, and 516 (24.54 percent) were slaughtered. The 1st of these outbreaks occurred in the Department of La Guajira (1 Jun 2013), and the following outbreaks in the Department of del Cesar (6 outbreaks), and the last outbreak in the Department of Magdalena (28 Mar 2014).

In each of these cases, the following measures were applied: herd quarantine, movement restrictions, epidemiological traceback, establishing focal and perifocal zones, slaughter, and sanitary carcass disposal. In addition, the public and private sectors have increased biosecurity on the affected and adjacent premises.

Available information confirms that the virus isolates are similar to the CSF strains found in Venezuela, thus suggesting that the source of introduction into Colombia may have been from Venezuela, as the affected area (La Guajira in Colombia) borders the State of Zulia in Venezuela.

CSF vaccination in Colombia:
-------------------------
Along the border with Venezuela (Colombian departments of Guajira, Cesar, Norte de Santander, Arauca and Casanare), vaccination is mandatory.

Dates of introduction of the infection:
--------------------------------
Unknown; however, given the surveillance by Colombia along the border, it is assumed that introduction was recent.

Possible sources of infection:
---------------------------
Illegal movement of pigs and pig products from Venezuela. (The existing price differential and exchange rates favor the movement from Venezuela into Colombia).

Control measures:
----------------
Although ICA has several border crossing control points, the Colombian pork industry has asked for additional check points and for these to be active around the clock.

In addition, the pork industry has requested that ICA re-vaccinate pigs in the departments along the Atlantic Coast (Magdalena, Atlantico, Bolivar, Sucre and Cordoba), strengthen its movement controls along the border, including the use of re-vaccination, and conduct sampling in the Departments located in Zone 4 (Santander, Boyaca, Cundinamarca, Meta, Tolkma, Huila, Caqueta, Casanare south), and conduct an epidemiologic study in Zone 3 (Antioquia, Caldas, Quindio, Risaralda, Valle and north of Cauca) in order to be recognized as CSF-free by the OIE.
