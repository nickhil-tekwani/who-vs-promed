The Hand, Foot & Mouth Disease Outbreaks In Johor And Singapore
---------------------------------------------------------------
JOHOR BARU: The Johor Health Department is working with its Singapore
counterpart to identify the type of virus responsible for the hand, foot &
mouth disease [outbreak which may have claimed the life of a 2-year-old
Singaporean boy last week. State Family Development, Women's Affairs and
Health Committee chairman Halimah Mohd Sadique said the department was
monitoring the Singapore outbreak to find any link with the 158 cases
reported in Johor to date. The Johor cases were found to be caused by the
[sic enterovirus [type 71? which is spread through direct contact with
faeces, saliva, nasal discharge and fluid from blisters. She said the
situation in Johor was "under control" and there was no need for quarantine
measures, adding that no deaths stemming from the disease had been reported.
She said the department had taken preventive measures, which included
mounting a health campaign to inform the public of its symptoms and
distributing literature advising them to practise strict personal hygiene.
Meanwhile, Menteri Besar Datuk Abdul Ghani Othman, who was also at the Press
conference, said he was worried that the disease might have been brought
over to Johor by Singaporeans visiting the State. He also cited the
40 000-odd Malaysians working on the other side of the Causeway as being a
cause for concern in transmitting the virus to children in Johor. The
disease usually flares up in hot and dry weather conditions and strikes
children aged between 2 weeks and 5 years.
