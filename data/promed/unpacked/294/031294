SHOREBIRDS, SUDDEN MORTALITY - BRAZIL (RIO GRANDE DO SUL)

UNUSUAL MORTALITY OF SANDPIPERS ALONG THE ATLANTIC COAST OF SOUTHERN BRASIL
IN APRIL 1997
I have just returned from an international expedition in Brasil, where we
studied the northward migration of Red Knots (Calidris canutus rufa) and
other shorebirds at Lagoa do Peixe, state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brasil, from
2-8 April. A first juvenile Red Knot was found dead on the beach on 6 April.
On 7 April 26 Red Knots, 10 White-rumped Sandpipers (Calidris fuscicollis)
and 3 Sanderlings (Calidris alba) were collected along a stretch of 10 km of
Atlantic Ocean beach. More than half of the birds were already dead, but the
others were sort of half-dead, lame, lethargic and not responding to any
form of handling. We gave the five best Red Knots, and three Sanderlings
repeated loads of fresh water to which some sugar and salt were added, but
their situation had not improved in 10 hrs; in fact, half of them had died
by then.
The birds were not emaciated (their masses were exactly the same as birds
caught previously and later that day), and the only other outward sign of
illness was some green faeces sticking to their cloacal feathers, an unual
type of faeces. Juveniles as well as migrating adults were affected. The
illness appeared rather acute, since two of the 300+ knots released in
glorious health the afternoon of 7 April were found in the same lethargic
disposition at the edge of the lagoon in the morning of 8 April, together
with five more unbanded Knots and one White-rumped Sandpiper in similar
condition. Later that day, along 35 km of beach we located at least another
13 sick or dead Red Knots along with ca. 550 live knots.
Note that the weather in Rio Grande do Sul was foul on 5 April, with a storm
from the south that drove the Atlantic waters high, and filled an almost
dried up Lagoa do Peixe to the rim! Does anybody have a clue as to what
could have been going on here? Is anyone reminded of similar incidents in
memory or published literature? Any ideas about which kind of ilness or
poisoning could have been responsible for what must have been a major
mortality? We have collected over 30 of the carcasses and brought them to
the Netherlands. It would be great to have more hints as to possible causes
before we start looking at these birds in more detail, hopefully with the
help of expert veterinarians.
