A Melbourne cafe has been closed after more than 36 people were diagnosed with salmonellosis. Lincoln Bakery Cafe, in Carlton, shut on 8 May 2020 after customers fell ill. An investigation is underway, Victoria Health Minister Jenny Mikakos confirmed during a press conference on Sat 16 May 2020.

No salmonella sufferers to date have been hospitalized, the state's chief health officer, Dr Brett Sutton, said. There have been 36 cases of food poisoning linked to the Lincoln Bakery Cafe in Carlton. Despite Dr Sutton's comments, a woman took to the cafe's Facebook page to claim her husband had to spend 2 days in hospital. "My husband was one of the ones that got sick and had to be hospitalized! They made people so violently sick," the woman wrote, before also leaving a bad review.

The health department is working with the City of Melbourne to determine the source of the infection, Ms Mikakos said. Anyone who ate at the cafe and may have shown symptoms of salmonellosis are encouraged to contact the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services.
