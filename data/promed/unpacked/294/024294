The virulent Beijing strain that was found in most multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) cases in Sikkim is a concern in Mumbai as well. Not only has the strain been identified in tuberculosis patients in Mumbai over the past decade, but in most cases it was also found to be drug-resistant. "We have collected strains from tuberculosis patients in the last one year in Mumbai, and found that almost 95 percent are drug resistant," said Dr Nerges Mistry, director, Foundation for Medical Research, referring to a study that is still under way.

The Hindu on [14 Jul 2016] reported the growing concern of MDR-TB in Sikkim, which is recording almost the same proportion of drug-resistant cases as Mumbai, India's TB capital. [See ProMED-mail post Tuberculosis - India (03): (SK) intro. of GeneXpert system, high MDR rates 20160716.4350079.] The ICMR's [Indian Council of Medical Research] institute in Dibrugarh had over the last year studied 120 MDR-TB strains in patients from Sikkim and identified 70 percent of them as Beijing strains.

Dr Mistry said that the genome sequencing of the strains found in TB patients in Mumbai has shown a lot of drug mutation, making the cases more difficult to treat. However, there are no data yet on the strain's prevalence and Dr Mistry said there was a need for surveillance to map the numbers.

The reason why tuberculosis experts are worried is because the drug-resistant Beijing strain has an enhanced fitness "in terms of their ability to grow as compared to the drug-sensitive strains," noted a study co-authored by Dr Mistry and published by the Elsevier. It further noted that the Beijing genotype was known to be associated with several outbreaks across the world "implying mechanisms which permit its predominance even in the presence of other competing strains."

"This highlights the virulent nature of the strain and its high transmission efficiency across different continents and thus its inherent ability to multiply faster in the presence of several strain types," the study says.

Studies published over the years have recorded the presence of the Beijing strain in Mumbai [1]. About a decade ago, doctors at PD Hinduja Hospital had reported a high frequency (35 percent) of the Beijing genotype among the MDR-TB [multidrug resistant tuberculosis] cases in a study published in Clinical Infectious Diseases journal. The high figure was, however, attributed to the hospital being a tertiary care facility that largely gets cases not responding to the treatment.

[Of 120 multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) strains from patients in Sikkim over the past year (2015-2016) 70 percent were reported to be 'Beijing strains' (ProMED-mail post Tuberculosis - India (03): (SK) intro. of GeneXpert system, high MDR rates 20160716.4350079). Beijing strains were first identified in 1995 in the Far East, mainly in Beijing province of China, on the basis of genotyping (http://jcm.asm.org/content/33/12/3234.long). Beijing strains are related on the basis of genotyping to a multidrug-resistant _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ strain, known as "W", that caused large institutional outbreaks of tuberculosis (TB) and many deaths in New York City in the 1990's (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00020788.htm). Strains of the Beijing/W genotype family of _M. tuberculosis_ have subsequently been found to have caused tuberculosis worldwide, predominating in some geographic areas, especially in Asia. Beijing strains represent about 50 percent of strains in East Asia and at least 13 percent of strains worldwide (http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(09)70330-5/abstract).

Beijing strains are frequently associated with multidrug resistance (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/8/8/02-0002_article) and outbreaks, which suggest increased transmissibility (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22865872). Beijing strains have also been found to exhibit increased virulence in animal models, being better able to withstand tuberculosis treatment, even in the absence of drug resistance (http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/201/4/553.full). - Mod.ML
