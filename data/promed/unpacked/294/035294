[Infectious haematopoietic necrosis (IHN) is a viral disease affecting
several species of salmonid fish. The principal clinical and economic
consequences of IHN occur at farms rearing fry or juvenile rainbow
trout in freshwater, where acute outbreaks can result in very high
mortality; however, both Pacific and Atlantic salmon reared in fresh
water or sea water can be severely affected. Caused by a rhabdovirus,
infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV), the disease is
typically characterised by gross signs that include lethargy
interspersed with bouts of frenzied, abnormal activity, darkening of
the skin, pale gills, ascites, distended abdomen, exophthalmia, and
petechial haemorrhages internally and externally.
