Girl infected by hantavirus in the Yungas
-----------------------------------------
In the Caranavi locality in the La Paz department, physicians at the Caranavi Hospital stated that a 13-year-old girl was infected by a hantavirus.

"We have had a hantavirus case. This is a 13-year-old adolescent from Carrasco", the hospital physician Henry Mamani stated.

The pathogen is transmitted by rodents, the health professional indicated.

"It is worth noting that these diseases are found in scattered places and the recommendations are for those who live there to always intensify hygiene measures mainly in the preparation of food," the physician stated.

The child is hospitalized.

Unfortunately, the specific circumstances under which this girl or the previous 2019 or 2020 cases acquired their infections are not mentioned. Presumably, they were in contact with excreta from infected rodent hosts. Infected rodents shed the virus in feces, urine, and saliva. Sporadic cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur in the Bolivian tropics.

Cases of hantavirus in lowland Bolivia occur sporadically. The specific hantaviruses involved in this or previous cases of hantavirus infection in Bolivia are not given. In the lowland Amazon basin of Bolivia, the hantaviruses that are likely to be in tropical La Paz department and might be involved in this hantavirus pulmonary syndrome case are Laguna Negra virus with its rodent hosts, _Calomys laucha_, the small vesper mouse (https://www.flickr.com/photos/cdtimm/4367939127/in/photolist-otqNuS-EwTizo-7DYQ8i-278Fjfq-owyXyD-osEZQs), and _C. callosus_, the large vesper mouse (http://www.faunaparaguay.com/calomyscallosus.html), as well as Rio Mamore virus with _C. laucha_ and _Oligoryzomys microtis_, the small-eared pygmy rice rat (https://www.reservacostanera.com.ar/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/colilargo-menor-oligoryzomys-flavescens2-JGV-e1298896507790.jpg).

However, Seoul hantavirus found in the widely distributed brown rat can not be excluded without laboratory tests. - Mod.TY
