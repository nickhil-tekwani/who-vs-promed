Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD) or monkey fever has claimed the life of a 48-year-old woman in Wayanad [district in Kerala state], at the Kozhikode government medical college on [Sun 8 Mar 2020]. This is the 1st KFD death in the state [Kerala] this year [2020].

The deceased [M], a tribal woman, hailing from Narangakunnu Colony at Kattikulam near the Kerala-Karnataka border was admitted to the Mananthavady district hospital on [4 Mar 2020] with symptoms of the disease and was shifted to the medical college on [6 Mar 2020].

A total of 3 other people who tested positive for KFD are currently under treatment, with 2 people admitted to Kozhikode medical college and one person at the Mananthavady district hospital. Wayanad DMO [District Medical officer] Dr. R Renuka said that the condition of the 3 patients was stable.

There have been 13 positive cases so far this year [2020] and 9 patients were discharged after recovery.

The department has stepped up surveillance and preventive measures in view of the KFD season, normally coinciding with the summer months, but those in high-risk categories are reluctant to get vaccinated, the DMO said. All the reported cases this year [2020] were from the Thirunelly panchayat [district Wayanad, Kerala] which is surrounded by forests, she added.

Health department authorities said that people living on forest fringes and those venturing into forests for livelihood like collection of minor forest produce, wood, etc, have been directed to get vaccinated.

Applying insect repellent ointments, using anti-tick lotions on domestic animals grazing in forest areas are some precautionary measures. Forest department staff has also been directed to receive KFD vaccination.

How KFD is transmitted
----------------------
KFD is transmitted primarily through bites of infected ticks (_Haemaphysalis spinigera_). The KFD outbreaks coincide with high nymphal activity of _Haemaphysalis spinigera_ ticks -- the main vector of the disease -- from January to May. Monkeys acquire the infection through infected tick bites and act as amplifying hosts with the virus getting transmitted to other ticks on monkeys. Also, when an infected monkey dies, ticks drop off from its body, thereby generating hotspots of infected ticks.

Symptoms
--------
The symptoms of the disease include sudden onset of fever, headache and generalized body pain. Also in the early phase of illness, gastrointestinal symptoms including vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhoea can also occur.

[Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD) is a tick-borne viral hemorrhagic disease caused by the Kyasanur Forest Disease Virus (KFDV). The Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD) has become a major public health problem in the State of Karnataka, India where the disease was 1st identified and in Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Kerala, and Goa covering the Western Ghats region of India https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-58242-w.

The case fatality of Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) is 2-10% and mortality is higher in the elderly and in individuals with co-morbid conditions. There is no specific treatment for KFD. Prompt symptomatic and supportive treatment can reduce morbidity and mortality. Surveillance (human, monkey, and tick), personal protection against tick bites, and vaccination are the key measures for prevention and control of KFD https://idsp.nic.in/WriteReadData/l892s/60398414361527247979.pdf. - Mod.UBA
