A death in Blackpool follows 9 fatalities in Scotland since the
contaminated heroin emerged in December 2009. Health experts are
investigating whether the heroin was contaminated with anthrax at source.

A drug user has become the 1st person to die in England from a batch
of anthrax-contaminated heroin, which has now killed 11 addicts in
the UK and Germany. The unnamed user from Blackpool is the 2nd case
in England to emerge in the last week after it emerged 5 days ago
that a female addict from London was being treated in hospital. The
death in Blackpool follows 9 fatalities across central Scotland since
the contaminated heroin emerged in early December 2009 in Glasgow.
There have been 19 confirmed cases in Scotland [now 21 cases, see
below], with deaths in Glasgow, Lanarkshire, Dundee, Fife and Stirling.

The German victim died in Aachen in December 2009, but the death was
only officially linked to the batch found in the UK last week, after
the strain was found to be "indistinguishable" from the type of
anthrax found in Scotland. The surge of cases -- the most serious
anthrax outbreak in the UK in recent times -- has puzzled police and
health experts, who remain uncertain how or where the heroin became
infected. The frequently lethal bacteria is mostly found in animals
in Asia and Africa and very rarely occurs in Europe. They are
investigating whether the heroin was contaminated at its likely
source in Afghanistan, perhaps from contaminated soils or contact
with infected animal skins, or was infected by a cutting agent used
by drug dealers or traffickers closer to Europe.

The cases in London and Germany have no known link to the Scottish
outbreak [as of yet, the results of genomic analysis are awaited. -
Mod.MHJ], increasing anxieties that the contamination could be
widespread. There has been only one previous case of a heroin user
dying from anthrax, in Norway in 2000.

Dr Arif Rajpura, the director of public health with NHS Blackpool,
repeated warnings to heroin users to stop taking the drug or watch
closely for unusual symptoms, including rashes, swelling, severe
headaches or high temperatures. "Heroin users are strongly advised to
cease taking heroin by any route, if at all possible, and to seek
help from their local drug treatment services. This is a very serious
infection for drug users, and prompt treatment is crucial," he said.

Health officials have confirmed a heroin user who tested positive for
anthrax has died. The 24-year-old from Blackpool was taken to the
town's Victoria Hospital on 28 Jan 2010 and died on 1 Feb 2010. The
Health Protection Agency (HPA), NHS Blackpool, and police are
investigating the circumstances surrounding the death and the source
or supply of the drugs.

A 36-year-old Blackpool woman arrested on suspicion of supplying or
offering drugs has been bailed until 2 Apr 2010, and a 35-year-old
man from Liverpool arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to
supply Class A drugs and a 21-year-old woman from Blackpool arrested
on suspicion of production or being concerned in the supply of Class
A drugs were released without charge.

This is the 2nd case of anthrax seen in an injecting drug user in
England, the 1st announced in London on 5 Feb 2010. Similar cases
have been seen in Scotland since December 2009.

A statement from NHS Blackpool said that while public health
investigations were ongoing, "it must be assumed that all heroin in
the northwest carries the risk of anthrax contamination." Heroin
users were warned to be alert to the risks and to seek urgent medical
advice if they experience signs of infection, as early antibiotic
treatment can be lifesaving.

Dependent on the dose and route of exposure, the symptoms may develop
within a week of taking heroin.

the north of Liverpool, go to: <http://www.fallingrain.com/icao/EGNH.html>.

From the ancillary information provided by the BBC, we might
speculate that the 24-year-old's dealer was the 36 year old Blackpool
woman, possibly on evidence provided by the other 2 individuals from
Liverpool and Blackpool respectively. Multiple deliveries of the
original contaminated material in Glasgow have been made, and on that
basis, other cases elsewhere in England can be expected. - Mod.MHJ]

Re: New cases in Scotland; see:
<http://www.hps.scot.nhs.uk/anthrax/index.aspx>. As of 10 Feb 2010, 2
new cases have been reported in Scotland in the Greater Glasgow and
Clyde NHS Board area. As the number of deaths remains at 9, we can
assume that these 2 individuals are hospital cases undergoing
treatment and may well survive.

As cases continue to occur in Glasgow and not in other Scottish
sites, maybe this pattern will continue.
