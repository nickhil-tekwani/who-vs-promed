The Press service of the Ministry of Emergency Situations [has]
communicated that 7 sailors from the ship "Roksolana-1" [in the port
of Yalta] have been transported to the hospital and one more died.

The ship's captain identified the dead sailor and others poisoned on
Sunday morning [16 Mar 2008]. The cause of the poisoning is unknown.
The ship is currently anchored and the captain is on board with 2
other crewmembers. There is no threat for the environment, the report
says.

This ship was going to Turkey under the flag of Belize with 1500 tons
of wheat. The crew consists of 10 Ukrainians and a Russian.

[It is difficult to [determine] the cause of the poisoning and it is
being investigated. There are different media reports indicating that
this is the 3rd case of the same type. In January 2006, 5 crewmembers
from the ship "Odysk" were hospitalised with ferro-silicium poisoning
and 2 of them died [but see comment below]. In December of 2007, 3
sailors from the Turkish ship "Begleri-Birederler" were admitted to
hospital with the same problem. - Corr.BA

Without additional clinical signs and symptoms experienced by the
sailors it is difficult to hazard a guess as to the toxin. We are not
told if this was ingestion, or inhalation, or contact. One wonders if
the grain was treated to prevent weevils or mold and may have been
offgassing toxic fumes.

Ferro-silicon (FeSi) is used in ferrous or iron metallurgy. It
usually contains about 80 percent of iron, 14-17 percent of silicon,
and 2 or 3 percent of other products. - Mod.TG

The ProMED ref. below refers to a fatal toxic episode on the ship
"Odysk" a year later, in January 2007, involving 10 crew members, 2 of
whom died. - Mod.JW
