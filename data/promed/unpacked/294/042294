In its latest annual global risk assessment of MERS-CoV, the World Health Organization (WHO) said transmission, symptom profile, and virus characteristics haven't changed since its last report, but officials are still deeply concerned about transmission in hospitals.

Since its last update in June 2018, 219 cases were reported in 4 countries: Saudi Arabia (204), Oman (13), South Korea (1), and the United Kingdom (1). However, of the 97 secondary cases reported to the WHO, 52 were linked to transmission in hospitals, including 23 infections in healthcare workers. Since the virus was 1st detected in humans in 2012, 2449 cases have been reported through [30 Jun 2019], 84% of them in Saudi Arabia.

The virus is known to spread more easily in healthcare settings, and research is underway to better understand the factors that drive transmission.

The WHO said awareness of the disease is still low, and the nonspecific early symptoms can make it difficult to identify cases. Gaps in infection prevention and control measures also contribute to disease spread. "Much more emphasis on improving standard IPC [infection prevention and control] practices in all healthcare facilities is required," the WHO said.

Over the past year, a cluster of 61 cases in Wadi ad-Dawasir in February and March [2019] sickened 61 people, 14 of them health workers. The outbreak involved 6 healthcare facilities, and human-to-human spread occurred in 2 of them. Then in April [2019], 1 of 2 unlinked clusters in Khafji resulted in 10 cases, 5 of them involving healthcare workers.

Elsewhere, Oman reported 2 unlinked clusters in January and February [2019], and one healthcare worker illness was reported in each of them.

The main epidemiologic pattern for MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) remains the same -- many introductions from dromedary camels in the Middle East and secondary transmission in healthcare settings -- the WHO said. Household transmission among close family members is still limited for unknown reasons, but healthcare-associated outbreaks in the region are occurring more often, are typically small, and can affect several hospitals.

The WHO said though the risk of explosive outbreaks remains, "the recent exported cases in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Korea in August/September 2018 show us that human-to-human transmission and large outbreaks can be prevented with early suspicion, case isolation, and clinical management."

Of the 219 patients reported over the past year, 49 had asymptomatic or mild cases, according to the report, which added that the number of asymptomatic cases has increased since 2015 because of a Saudi health ministry policy change requiring that all high-risk contacts be tested for MERS-CoV. "This comprehensive contact identification, follow-up, testing, and isolation of positive cases continues into 2019," it said.

In 145 (66.2%) of the cases, patients had at least one underlying health condition, the most common being chronic renal failure, heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension.

The WHO said surveillance for MERS-CoV has significantly improved, especially in the Middle East, as has multisector investigation of community-acquired cases, including testing of dromedary camels in areas where human cases are detected. And aggressive investigation of cases and contacts and applying steps to stop human-to-human spread in hospitals are mitigating the size of outbreaks, it added.

Ongoing challenges include early identification of cases in the community and in healthcare settings, compliance with IPC measures, and contact follow-up, according to the report.

The new update also detailed the work of the WHO's MERS technical team over the past year and highlighted some of its current and planned activities. For example, the team posted new guidance documents, such as one on clinical management, and pushed forward with a research and development blueprint.

According to the report, the WHO team and those involved with the blueprint are working on phase 2b/phase 3 clinical trial protocols to evaluate MERS-CoV therapies and vaccines.

Also, experts are updating investigation tools to help countries during outbreaks. The WHO said it continues to support field-based studies -- either in planning stages or already underway -- to explore the extent of spillover from animals to humans in countries outside of the Arabian Peninsula, including Algeria, Egypt, Ethiopia, Pakistan, Somalia, and Sudan.

[The full document "WHO MERS Global Summary and Assessment of Risk" July 2019 WHO/MERS/RA/19.1 can be found at https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/326126/WHO-MERS-RA-19.1-eng.pdf?ua=1 and is worth reading.

A key summary point raising awareness and concern in the document: "The continued occurrence of health care-associated outbreaks is deeply concerning and is the result of low awareness and early suspicion of MERS-CoV infections. The non-specificity of MERS symptoms complicates surveillance activities for the virus, often resulting in early missed cases, including the index case, in outbreaks and thereby providing the opportunity for human-to-human transmission in health care settings. Much more emphasis on improving standard IPC practices in all health care facilities is required."

I still wonder WHY Saudi Arabia? Why is Saudi Arabia the epicenter of the MERS-CoV transmission when there are clearly isolated reported events happening in other countries. Most recently, the 2 outbreaks in Oman at the beginning of 2019? And previously there were multiple outbreaks in the UAE. The Korean national returning to South Korea following a business trip to Kuwait and a return via Dubai. Previous cases have been reported with exposure postulated to be in Kuwait, but the history of travel through Dubai may have had exposure while in transit or on the plane(s), as Dubai is one of the central hubs for travel to and from the Middle East. What is different about Saudi Arabia? Is it just a more heightened awareness to suspect MERS-CoV infection so milder cases are identified (much of the time)? Is there a higher background prevalence of co-morbidities such as diabetes that may affect transmission of the virus to and from those with diabetes? Are the animal husbandry practices markedly different, leading to a higher general population indirect exposure? What is the transmissibility of the virus in asymptomatic infections or in mild clinical illness associated with infections? Is this relevant to address the question of why Saudi Arabia? Are there ongoing comparative studies of outbreaks in different countries?

In the 4 days since the last update [MERS-CoV (59): Saudi Arabia (RI, QS) 20190805.6607355], there have been no newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by Saudi Arabia. In addition, there have been no new reports of outcomes of the 2 previously reported cases currently listed as active cases.
