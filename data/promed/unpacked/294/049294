----------------------------------------------------------------------
Notwithstanding a recent outbreak in Dushanbe, rates of hepatitis B in
Tajikistan and surrounding countries have declined considerably since
the 1990's, and are similar to those reported in the United States.

Interestingly, this trend began a decade before the introduction of
universal hepatitis B vaccination in the region. [1,2]

[ProMED-mail thanks Prof Berger for provision of these data, and for
drawing attention to the fact that the recorded incidence of hepatitis
B infection in Tajikistan and its Central Asian neighbors had begun to
decline prior to the general availability of hepatitis B virus
vaccine. Presumably this reflected a greater awareness of the problem
of blood-borne transmission of hepatitis disease and a general
improvement in medical and blood transfusion procedures.
