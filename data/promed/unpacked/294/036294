Oman's Ministry of Health has reported 6 cases of the Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, CCHF, in a number of Omani governorates, and said one person died of the disease.

All of the CCHF patients had caught the tick-borne virus through contact with slaughtered or livestock animals already infected with the virus or hosting the tick vectors on their bodies, an official source from the Ministry of Health was quoted by Oman News Agency, ONA, as saying.

ONA noted that similar cases were reported over the past years in the country.

The CCHF virus, which has a fatality rate of up to 40 per cent, usually spreads to humans from cattle through tick bites or contact with meat after slaughter and can cause severe viral haemorrhagic fever outbreaks, according to the World Health Organisation, WHO.

[Cases of CCHF virus infection have occurred previously in Oman. The last Omani case reported in ProMED-mail (archive no. 20120123.1019272), in 2012, was suspected due to contact with animals illegally imported into Oman. In that post, Mod.AS noted, "CCHF virus (CCHFV) circulates in an enzootic tick-vertebrate-tick cycle; members of the tick genus _Hyalomma_ seem to be the principal vectors. The virus can be found in many species of wild and domestic mammals, including cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, horses, donkeys, and dogs. There is no evidence that the virus causes disease in animals. Domesticated ruminants including cattle, sheep, and goats are viremic for one week after experimental infections; the only symptom was a transient, mild elevation in body temperature. The introduction of viremic, symptomless animals to slaughterhouses can expose their personnel to infection. Otherwise, infected ticks are the main link between infected animals and humans; acaricides can be used on livestock and other domesticated animals to control ticks, particularly before slaughter or export.

In meat, CCHFV is usually inactivated by post-slaughter acidification. It is also killed by cooking. Unpasteurized milk should not be drunk."
