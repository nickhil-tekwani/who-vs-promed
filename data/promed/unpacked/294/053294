With the death of 5 more patients on Sunday [14 Jul 2019], the toll in Japanese encephalitis (JE) cases in Assam rose to 76, a National Health Mission (NHM) bulletin stated. The registered positive JE cases across the state also increased to 348 from 334 on Friday [12 Jul 2019]. The 5 deaths were reported from Darrang, Nalbari, Tinsukia, Kamrup and Udalguri districts, the bulletin said.

Giving the cumulative figures for JE/AES (acute encephalitis syndrome), the bulletin said there [had been] 1350 such cases since January this year [2019], with 177 deaths.

Measures to control the mosquitoborne disease that affects the brain continued to be taken across the state, which is currently undergoing a transmission season for JE, NHM sources said. Health minister Dr Himanta Biswa Sarma has said the emergency measures taken to combat the JE/AES situation would exist till 30 Sep [2019]. Union health minister Harsh Vardhan had on [30 Jun 2019] dispatched a central team to review the situation in the state. The health minister also said that his ministry is providing all logistical and technical support to the state government in terms of surveillance and diagnostic kits to strengthen their efforts in addressing JE.

Noting that community participation and empowerment are the most crucial in JE prevention, Vardhan urged all the stakeholders to start rigorous awareness campaigns regarding the preventive steps to be taken by the communities. For rehabilitation of JE-disabled patients, the central government has provided funds for the strengthening of 2 physical medicine and rehabilitation departments at Dibrugarh Medical College and Guwahati Medical College.

[The number of Japanese encephalitis (JE) cases has been accelerating in Assam state over the past 2 weeks. An 8 Jul 2019 post stated that at least 49 deaths and 190 positive cases were reported due to JE as of 5 Jul [2019] from January this year [2019]. Case numbers are now 348 with 76 deaths. The only feasible steps that the communities could take are elimination of culex mosquito breeding sites within the community and avoidance of mosquito bites. Because the culex vector mosquitoes also breed in rice paddies, which may be extensive, vector control over large areas is difficult. It is curious that no mention is made of vaccination campaigns in the affected areas. Vaccination is the most effective measure to prevent JE virus infection. A 15 Jul 2019 report just released by the National Health Mission stated that 6 more people have died of JE, bringing the total to 82 (https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/assam-japanese-encephalitis-death-toll-1569762-2019-07-15).

There continues to be an increase in cases of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) as well, with 1350 cases and 177 deaths reported above. There is no indication of what the etiology of those AES cases might be. As noted previously, many times the determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive. Some cases of AES are frequently attributed to JE, but many are of undefined etiology. AES has continued to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heatstroke, lychee fruit consumption, and scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_). A recent publication states that dengue virus is one of the 3 commonest agents identified in AES, but existing surveillance for AES does not include routine testing for dengue. Until the etiology (or etiologies) of these AES cases is determined, effective and efficient prevention of these cases will not be possible. - Mod.TY
