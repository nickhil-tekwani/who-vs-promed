8 die from possible anthrax in Bima, NTB
--------------------------------------------------------------
8 residents of Bima, West Nusa Tenggara (NTB) on the island of Sumbawa died
last month after consuming goat meat allegedly infected with anthrax,
Antara reported.
Bima administration spokesman GP Ariadi confirmed the report Wednesday.
"They died on 18 Dec 2002, but it was reported to the administration on
Monday," he said. All of the victims came from Doringgu village, about 75
kilometers from Bima. The health agency and animal husbandry agency are
currently examining the case. "We will examine all livestock in the area to
prevent it from spreading," Ariadi said.
Separately, Sudadi of the Bogor health agency in West Java confirmed that
there are 7 residents in the area who are suffering anthrax after eating
goat meat at a party held by their neighbor. "We will take preventive moves
to prevent it from spreading," he said, saying that the seven were in
stable condition after undergoing medical treatment.
The disease, caused by _Bacillus anthracis_, is commonly found in the
Bogor. Last year, the same disease attacked several ostriches that were
being reared on a farm there.
Antara reported that Muslim residents in the area were worried about the
disease, because they would celebrate Idul Adha day, when they slaughter
goats or cows for the celebration.
