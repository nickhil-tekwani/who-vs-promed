One person has died of Lassa fever in the northern part of Togo, according to an announcement made by the Ministry of Health, Public Hygiene and Universal Access to Care, on Sunday [27 Feb 2022].

"A case of Lassa virus disease was confirmed on [26 Feb 2022]. This is a 35-year-old woman, residing in the Oti-Sud district, who died of complications from the disease", underlines the press release signed Moustafa Mijiyawa, Minister in charge of Health.

In order to protect the population, the health authorities have taken measures, including the intensification of investigations in the community for the search for possible cases or deaths and the search for contacts.

"Lassa virus disease is a viral hemorrhagic fever that can infect anyone. It is contagious and serious. Humans are generally infected by exposure to the urine or excrement of infected rodents (...)", underlines the note which invites the population to be extra vigilant.

[Lassa fever virus is endemic in much of northwest Africa, including Togo. There have been cases of Lassa fever in Togo as recently as 2017 and 2019. In the 2017 report, health authorities in Togo implemented the following measures to respond to these Lassa fever cases, including:

- deployment of rapid response teams to the affected areas for epidemiological investigation;
- identification of contacts and follow-up;
- strengthening of infection prevention and control measures in health facilities and briefing of health workers;
- strengthening of cross-border collaboration and information exchanges between Togo, Burkina, Mali, and Benin.

Intensification of investigations is underway currently and one hopes that all of these same measures are being implemented now.

The case report above mentions contact with rodent reservoirs of the virus or their excrement as a source of infection. Lassa fever virus is transmitted to humans from contact with food or household items contaminated with excreta of multimammate rats (_Mastomys_ spp), the reservoir host. Public education is an important measure to prevent infections in the home.
