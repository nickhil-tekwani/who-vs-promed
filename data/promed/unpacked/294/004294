We use the JE vaccine manufactured by the Biken Institute in Osaka.
Kaketsuken in Japan (Kumamoto) also makes a high quality product. We
administer the vaccine here at the QSMI (Thai Red Cross Institute) in
Bangkok to anyone who requests it for about US $8 - including
administration costs. We usually give the 3 injection series recommended
by the manufacturer.
Why would the price be so high in Australia? Order the vaccine directly
from the manufacturers on tender!
