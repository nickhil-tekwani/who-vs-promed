The following paper is published as a work in progress because of its
importance. Most readers will still glean information from the initial
results.
The study confirms that CWD transmits to cattle, though quite poorly,
assuming the original intra-cerebral inoculation was potent. Deer and
cattle prions are about as close as hamster and mouse; species barrier
oddities have long been known in rodents. Nothing is learned from
deer-to-cattle about deer-to-human, such is the unpredictability of the
species barrier.
Nothing is learned about deer-to-sheep either. Since horizontal transfer
from sheep to deer at the Foothills Research Station confinement facility
in Ft. Collins is the best available hypothesis for the origin of CWD,
sheep would have to be tested in a separate experiment. Sheep and deer
commonly share pastures and public land. Again, deer-to-sheep efficiency
need not be the same as sheep-to-deer. (The explanation is simple: the
prion seed crystals from the donor species recruit prion monomers from the
recipient; these are of different amino acid sequence; by the time the
infection is clinical the agent has jumped genomes while retaining some
conformational information from the seed. That process is inherently not
symmetrical.)
The study also concludes that diagnostic reagents used today in BSE surveys
would pick up CWD transmitted to cattle (as well as UK BSE). However, if
the US goes over to the Prionics test, it needs to verify that that test
finds transmitted CWD as well.

To determine the transmissibility of chronic wasting disease (CWD) to
cattle and to provide information about clinical course, lesions, and
suitability of currently used diagnostic procedures for detection of CWD in
cattle, 13 calves were inoculated intracerebrally with brain suspension
from mule deer naturally affected with CWD.
Between 24 and 27 months postinoculation, 3 animals became recumbent and
were euthanized. Gross necropsies revealed emaciation in 2 animals and a
large pulmonary abscess in the third. Brains were examined for
protease-resistant prion protein (PrP(res)) by immunohistochemistry and
western blotting, and for scrapie-associated fibrils (SAFs) by
negative-stain electron microscopy. Microscopic lesions in the brain were
subtle in 2 animals and absent in the third case.
However, all 3 animals were positive for PrP(res) by immunohistochemistry
and western blot, and SAFs were detected in 2 of the animals. An
uninoculated control animal euthanized during the same period did not have
PrP(res) in its brain.
These are preliminary observations from an experiment in progress. The 10
remaining inoculated cattle are alive and apparently healthy 3 years after
the CWD challenge. These preliminary findings demonstrate that diagnostic
techniques currently used for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)
surveillance would also detect CWD in cattle should it occur naturally.
