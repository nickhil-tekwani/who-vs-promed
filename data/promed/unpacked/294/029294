The 1st anthrax case of the year [2019] was confirmed in one captive antelope on a premises in Uvalde County on [Wed 19 Jun 2019]. "The premises is located within the triangular area of Texas where anthrax is historically found in the soil," said Dr. Susan Rollo, state epidemiologist. "There is an effective anthrax vaccine available for use in susceptible livestock in high-risk areas. We encourage you to consult with your local veterinary practitioner."

The premises has been placed under quarantine and will not be released from quarantine until the animals have been vaccinated and the affected carcasses are properly disposed of, as outlined in Texas Animal Health Commission [TAHC] rules.

Anthrax is a bacterial disease caused by _Bacillus anthracis_, which is a naturally occurring organism with worldwide distribution, including certain parts of Texas. The bacteria can surface, contaminating soil and grass, after periods of wet, cool weather followed by hot, dry conditions. During these conditions, animals ingest the anthrax bacteria when they consume contaminated grass and hay, or by inhaling the spores. Outbreaks will usually end when cooler weather arrives. Acute fever followed by rapid death with bleeding from body openings are common signs of anthrax in livestock. Carcasses may also appear bloated and decompose quickly. Livestock or animals displaying symptoms consistent with anthrax should be reported to a private veterinary practitioner or a TAHC official.

Producers are encouraged to follow basic sanitation precautions when handling affected livestock or carcasses. It is recommended to wear protective gloves and long-sleeve shirts and to wash thoroughly afterward to prevent accidental spread of the bacteria to people.

[This report is sparse on meaningful information on this outbreak. With only one "antelope" reported, I suspect that this report originally came not from a veterinarian in Uvalde County, but from the diagnostic lab at Texas A&M University (TAMU) College Station using the little information on the document submitted with the singular sample. Unfortunately, a not uncommon circumstance. There will have been other animals affected. That is the nature of this disease.

But I suspect that the ranch affected is the 2000 acre (809 ha) wildlife ranch affected in 2013, which I was able to visit (see Anthrax - USA (05): (TX) sable antelope 20131002.1980336 and Anthrax - USA (04): (TX) sable antelope, RFI 20130927.1972294). That outbreak started in some cattle immediately outside the back gate of the ranch, and flies carried it through the 8 ft [2.4 m] fence around the ranch. The dead animals were all burnt. This ranch had an extraordinary range of exotic wildlife species for clients to shoot (or "hunt," in Texas terms) at a high cost and which the client would be able to display in his office to impress his colleagues. Texas male culture. I will make inquiries with my informed rural Texas contacts.

Latterly there has been an absence of anthrax outbreaks in Texas reflecting the dry weather there. This outbreak may indicate a change in frequency. - Mod.MHJ
