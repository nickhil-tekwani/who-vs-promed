[All the 8 provinces mentioned above (out of a total of 48 provinces in Algeria) are located in the northern, fertile, populated regions of Algeria; Medea, the most western affected province, is located about 450 km (about 280 miles) from Algeria's western border, with Morocco. See map and data on the size/area (in sq km) of each province and its population, at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria#Provinces_and_districts. The numbering of the provinces is in Arabic alphabetical order.

Algeria reported on 27 Jul 2014 an outbreak in cattle in the province of Setif, indicating that serotyping was "pending". The serotyping should have been completed by now. An official follow-up report with the serotype identity and details on the additional outbreaks is anticipated to be submitted soon. - Mod.AS]

Six [apparently 8, according to data in item 1 above - Mod.AS] of Algeria's provinces are affected by FMD. Livestock owners complain and say they may go bankrupt, while the Ministry of Agriculture is launching preventive measures and pointing fingers at farmers accusing them of not reporting suspected cases in a timely manner, favoring thereby the spread of the disease.

In Bouira [wilaya/province], the authorities decided to close all livestock markets after the detection of a case last Wednesday [30 Jul 2014] in the city of Ain Turk, northwest of the capital of the province. This outbreak was reported following an introduction in the province of cattle purchased at livestock markets in the wilaya of Setif. "All necessary steps have been taken by us to prevent the spread of the viral disease," said the Director of Animal Health (DSA) of Bouira, Dr. Morseli Rachid, who also declared that a monitoring unit was immediately installed in his province.

In Medea [wilaya], the veterinary services urged farmers to take all necessary precautions to protect their animals from the dangerous virus, which was supposedly introduced into the region via diseased animals originating from neighboring wilayas. 8 cases were found last Sunday [27 Jul 2014] in 3 farms located in the town of Benchicao. 8 of the 11 examined cattle were immediately slaughtered and the offals and meat parts likely to carry the virus incinerated. Mohamed Slama, veterinary and department head at the DSA signals the urgency to implement the aforementioned measures.

"The main source of this epizootic are the owners of the 1st 75 registered bovine cases who hid their cattle when they noticed they were infected and threw the bodies," said Karim Boughanem, Director of Veterinary Services, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. This highly contagious animal disease affects cattle, sheep and goats. But it is thought the virus currently in circulation in Algeria has a specific tropism to cattle. "Contamination of the Algerian livestock came initially from Tunisia to Daira Bir El Arch," he adds.

Since the contamination concerns, for now, an area of high concentration of cattle, this warning may result in serious economic constraints and declines in livestock prices. "Prices of cattle heads have fallen since the discovery of the 1st case. Farmers sell their cattle at any price for fear of losing a lot economically, and therefore the red meat market is experiencing a remarkable decline in prices, "said Mohamed Tahar Ramram, President of the section of red meat of the General Union of Algerian Traders and Artisans (UGCAA).

"This warning is a blow to farmers in the eastern region, as all livestock markets are preventively closed to limit the spread of the disease. Dr. Ramram is worried that some farmers do not adhere to the policy in place and this would undermine the efforts for combatting the disease presently underway. He added, "Thanks to the mobilization of the services concerned, between 110 and 115 farmers affected by the crisis have been supported." Unfortunately compensation of these farmers is still awaited.

Commission supplies emergency consignment of foot-and-mouth disease vaccine to Algeria and Tunisia
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The European Commission is sending, as an emergency response, a total of 1.1 million doses of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) vaccines to the Algerian and Tunisian authorities, in support of the FMD control campaign carried out following the spread of a new strain of the virus. The European Commission is responding to a request from the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) who asked for urgent assistance to supply a high quality vaccine for a vaccination campaign against the FMD epidemic due to the lack of available options to obtain in due time vaccines from other sources. The vaccine is formulated from the antigen stocks stored in the EU antigen bank. The shipment is due to be delivered within the next 2 weeks [by about 15 Aug 2014]. The vaccine will be used to immunise cattle, sheep and goats. The European Commission is supporting the eradication programme since this highly contagious viral disease affecting cloven-hoofed animals represents a threat to the EU's FMD free status and in particular to its Mediterranean Member States. The EU does not allow imports of live susceptible animals from Algeria and Tunisia or any of their products. Persons travelling from those countries to the EU are prohibited from bringing in their luggage any meat and milk products as they may harbour the virus.

[It seems that the European Commission authorities believe both Tunisia and Algeria to share the same FMDV strain. The Tunisian strain has been serotyped O and genotyped as FMDV "O/ME-SA/Ind-2001 lineage". This strain is known to have spread in recent years from the Indian sub-continent into West Eurasia and North Africa (Libya), and appears to be gaining pace. Since late 2013, further O/ME-SA/Ind-2001 outbreaks have been recognized in Saudi Arabia; and since early 2014 in the United Arab Emirates. In April 2014, this virus was reported from Tunisia, causing numerous outbreaks in cattle and small ruminants (sheep and goats), and spreading further west into Algeria (probably earlier than reported). According to their respective reports, all 3 Maghreb countries, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco, have not experienced FMD outbreaks since 1999.

A useful update on the global FMD situation is available in the monthly "EUFMD Foot-and-Mouth Disease Situation Report" for June 2014, available at http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/eufmd/docs/FMD_monthly_reports/JUNE2014_Final.pdf. It includes a detailed review on Tunisia, with map and graphic (pages 13, 14, 15). The guest editor indicated that "vaccine matching tests (are) needed" in relation to Tunisia (see table 7, page 16).

Both Tunisia and Algeria have reported mass vaccinations during 2014; it will be interesting to obtain information on the vaccine strains included and the protection conferred according to field observations.

Information on the vaccine strain included in the vaccines to be soon supplied by the European Commission to Tunisia and Algeria will be helpful.

Morocco deserves to take preventive measures against the virus circulating in the 2 other Maghreb countries. An article (in French) addressing this need is available at http://www.libe.ma/La-menace-de-fievre-aphteuse-plane-sur-le-cheptel-national_a52687.html. - Mod.AS
