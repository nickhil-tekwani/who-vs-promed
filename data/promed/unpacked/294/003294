Given the spread of an outbreak of brucellosis in the area since the
beginning of August [2009], the local head of the health jurisdiction
VII, Joel Martinez Mendez, called on the population of Leon to avoid
the consumption of unpasteurized dairy products, mainly those derived
from goat's milk.

So far, 28 cases have been reported in the locality, although only 18
were confirmed. This makes Leon the 3rd city with the most cases [in
2009], after Guanajuato with 136 cases, and Romita with 110 cases.

Martinez Mendez noted that brucellosis bacteria can remain living in
refrigerated contaminated milk for up to 10 days, in Roquefort cheese
for 2 months, ad in refrigerated butter for 4 months. In the
environment the bacteria can survive in water for 10 to 70 days and
in the dust or soil for up to 10 weeks.

[Brucellosis is just one of many infectious diseases that can be
spread through unpasteurized milk or dairy products. Others include
salmonellosis, listeriosis, campylobacteriosis, bovine tuberculosis,
and enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_.
