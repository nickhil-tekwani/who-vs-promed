Kyrgyzstan: Outbreak of Rabies in 3 Villages in Naykatsk District
-----------------------------------------------
According to the Sanitary and Epidemiological Surveillance Center in
Osh, during the period 19 to 20 Jul 2005, a dog owned by a man in the
village of Talas (Naykatsk district) bit 31 people, 8 dogs and 2
calves within the surroundings of 3 villages (Talas, On Eki Bel and
Bel-Kairagach). The dog was killed, and its head was sent to the
Regional Veterinary Laboratory. It was confirmed on 21 Jul 2005 that
the dog was rabid.
Epidemiological studies revealed that 6 people in the village of
Talas, 8 people in the village of On Eki Bel and 17 people in the
village of Bel Kairagach had been bitten. In addition, another 25
people had been in contact with the dog. All of these people, bite
victims and exposed persons, were prescribed a course of anti-rabies
vaccine.
During the period 20 to 23 Jul 2005, a total of 88 dogs, 203 head of
cattle, 112 dogs and 16 cats were vaccinated.

[This is an unusually large incident. However, the prompt
administration of anti-rabies virus vaccine (and presumably rabies
immune globulin) by the local authorities should ensure that there
will be no fatalities. - Mod.CP]
