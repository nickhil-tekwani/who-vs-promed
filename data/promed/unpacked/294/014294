Disease Closes 3 Sudanese Towns
-----------------------------------
KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) - Sudanese authorities have closed off
three towns in western Sudan after meningitis killed 21 people, the
official news agency said Thursday [7 Jan 1999].
The disease has infected 126 other people in the towns of
el-Fasher, Kutum and Kebkabiya, about 500 miles west of the
capital, Khartoum, the Sudan News Agency said.
The North Darfur provincial authorities declared a state of
emergency around the towns to contain the outbreak, closing schools
and preventing traffic from leaving and entering the area, the
agency said.
The Health Ministry has mobilized medical teams to care for
those inflected by the disease, which inflames the membranes of the
brain and the spinal cord.
Outbreaks of meningitis occur occasionally in Sudan during the summer.
It is not known what has caused this outbreak during the winter.

[Meningitis in the meningitis belt of Africa is seasonal & usually
caused by meningococcal infection. But viral meningitis also exists.
We look forward to the identification of the agent - Mod.JW]
