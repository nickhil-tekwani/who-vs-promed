As of 8 Jun 2006, 50 cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF)
have been registered in the Southern Federal District of Russia,
including 4 fatal cases. Eight cases of CCHF have been registered in
the Stavropol region, 21 in the Republic of Kalmykia, 14 in the
Rostov region, 3 in the Astrakhan region and 4 in the Volgograd
region. The first cases of CCHF were registered in the middle of
April 2006 in Stavropol region, and in the beginning of May in the
Republic of Kalmykia and the Rostov region.
In 2006 there has been a marked expansion in the distribution of CCHF
cases: new cases have been detected in the Zymovnikovskiy,
Tsymlyanskiy and Tselinniy districts of the Rostov region where no
cases have been observed in recent years. Consequently late
recognition of the disease and late referral for medical attention
have resulted in severe manifestation of the disease.
Most cases occurred during care of agricultural animals in private
facilities. It is especially important to undertake preventive
treatment of animals against tick infestation. However, due to
insufficient allocation of finances for these purposes, fewer than 50
percent of animals had been protected against ticks by the end of May 2006.

including 3 fatalities, were registered in the Stavropol, Astrakhan,
Volgograd and Rostov regions, and the Republics of Dagestan
and Kalmykia. CCHF morbidities in the Southern Federal District
remain at the same level as 2005 and exceed those in 2004 more than
2-fold, according to <http://www.tltnews.ru/runews/fullnews.php?id=1247>.
The Southern Federal District (SFD) is one of 7 federal
