Amid a measles outbreak in Israel, 2 high school students and a teacher contract the disease. The cases follow the death of an unvaccinated baby in Jerusalem on [Thu 1 Nov 2018] as the Health Ministry is calling on parents to vaccinate their children immediately.

Two female high school seniors came last week to school while sick with measles, the Katzrin Regional Council stated [Sun 4 Nov 2017]. According to a statement by the council, the students -- who were not vaccinated -- came to school ill and after a medical examination they were diagnosed with the disease.

Israel's Health Ministry was updated accordingly and parents of students in the school were informed as well. Some 500 high school students attend the 2 high schools in Katzrin.

Earlier [Sun 4 Nov 2018], a school teacher from an elementary school in Ashdod also discovered that she is ill with measles. The teacher went through checkups and discovered last [Thu 30 Oct 2018] that she has symptoms of the illness. Aside from working at the elementary school, the teacher was also employed by 3 other schools. The Education Ministry said it has been working with the Health Ministry on a response and that the Health Ministry would be vaccinating any students at the school by the end of the day [Sun 4 Nov 2018], if they had not yet received a vaccination.

The Health Ministry called on all parents whose children have not been vaccinated to do so immediately. Last month [October 2018], Health Ministry Director General Itamar Grotto said 95 percent of Israelis are vaccinated against measles, but there are some population groups for which vaccination rates are lower than 90 percent.

Last week [1 Nov 2018], a 1.5-year-old child from an insular ultra-Orthodox sect in Jerusalem died of measles in the 1st such death since a measles outbreak that began in the country in March [2018]. The baby had not been registered with the Interior Ministry or for baby care.

In recent weeks, doctors in Jerusalem hospitals warned that they were losing control over the outbreak and raised the prospect that complications from the illness could turn fatal. According to Health Ministry data, in the 1st 10 months of 2018, there were 1287 reported cases of measles in the country, about 60 percent of which were in the Jerusalem area.

The Health Ministry has reached out to ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods of the city, hoping to increase the vaccination rates there. In addition to the Jerusalem area, where 753 cases have been reported, there have been 213 cases reported in the Safed district, 89 in the Petah Tikva district, 84 in the Tel Aviv district, and smaller numbers elsewhere, including Acre, Ramle, the Sharon region, Afula, Rehovot, Be'er Sheva, Haifa, and Ashkelon. In October [2018] alone, 621 people were infected. Most have been children between the ages of 1 and 4. There have also been outbreaks abroad.

YWN [The Yeshiva World] has been reporting extensively about the measles outbreak, currently spreading through multiple Chareidi [Orthodox Jewish] communities due to the so-called "anti-vaxxer" cult, who refuse to give the highly recommended and effective vaccine. Health departments are extremely concerned, and there is panic spreading among parents of children in schools.

The outbreak has spread from Israel, where over 1200 people have been sickened, and an unvaccinated 18-month-old child [died].

Below are the latest updates:
Rockland county (Monsey, Spring Valley, New Square)
---------------------------------------------------
As of this report, there are close to 50 cases in Rockland county. 2 children have been hospitalized -- one in intensive care -- because of the measles outbreak, and the health department is taking more precautions to make sure it doesn't spread among students.

The Viznitz Monsey Girls School announced that any child who is not immunized, can't return to school for 21 days. No "religious exemption" is accepted. A religious exemption does not work when there is a measles outbreak.

Rockland county's Commissioner of Health, Dr Patricia Schnabel Ruppert, announced [Wed 31 Oct 2018] that all schools in the Village of New Square are now required to keep students who are un-vaccinated or under-vaccinated against the disease home until 21 days have passed since the last case of measles is confirmed in the county.

However, YWN has obtained a recording taken on Sunday morning [4 Nov 2018] from one of the anti-vaxxer hotlines in Rockland county. A woman giving an update to the listeners says that "it's ok to send your children to school tomorrow, Monday morning [5 Nov 2018] in Monsey -- even without a letter. We will be distributing/getting a letter out as soon as possible."

At least 2 Shuls [synagogues] that YWN knows of have informed their members that anyone not vaccinated can not enter the Shul.

This follows the story YWN published on [Fri 2 Nov 2018], where at least 6 Shuls in Lakewood have made the same rule. 6 schools in Lakewood have made the same rule, and others are expected to follow suite.

New Jersey (Ocean county, Lakewood)
----------------------------------
Hundreds of people are showing up at their pediatricians to get vaccinations, following the report of at least 4 confirmed cases of measles in Lakewood.

The Ocean County Health Department and the NJ EMS [New Jersey Emergency Medical Services] Task Force have arrived in Lakewood, and set up large tents outside CHEMED [Center for Health Education, Medicine, & Dentistry] Health Clinic, and have ordered approximately 1500 vaccinations to be administered to those requesting it.

At Doctor Shanik's office, the premier and senior pediatrician in Lakewood, there are reportedly no vaccines available as they have run out.

New York City (Williamsburg, Boro Park)
---------------------------------------
In NYC, the Health Department is reporting 11 new cases of children with confirmed measles, bringing the total to 17. Chassidish [Orthodox Jewish] communities in Williamsburg and Borough Park are affected. The children with measles range in age from 7 months-4 years.

New York City's Health Department is warning of an outbreak of measles in Brooklyn's Orthodox Jewish community and calling on parents to have their children vaccinated.

The department said [Fri 2 Nov 2018] that there are 11 new cases of measles in the Orthodox enclave, bringing to 17 the number of children who have been recently diagnosed with measles in Williamsburg and Borough Park [New York].

The department said 3 infections, including the initial case of measles, were acquired by children on a visit to Israel, where a large outbreak of the disease is occurring.

"There has also been transmission in schools with children who are unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated," the department said in a release.

Health officials and community groups have reported relatively low vaccination rates in Orthodox neighborhoods. Some blame a faulty perception that fervently religious Jews are protected from infection by the relatively insulated nature of their communities, on top of rumors, unfounded according to public health officials, about dangers from vaccinations.

To counter this, the city Health Department enlisted community figures to encourage vaccination against measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), including Rabbi David Niederman, president of the United Jewish Organizations of Williamsburg and North Brooklyn, and Rabbi Avi Greenstein, executive director of the Boro Park Jewish Community Council.

"It says in the Torah 'V'nishmartem Meod L'nafshoseichem,' that a person must guard their health," Niederman said in the Health Department news release. "It is abundantly clear on the necessity for parents to ensure that their children are vaccinated, especially from measles."

The Health Department is working with local health care providers, religious schools, and Orthodox newspapers to spread the word about vaccines.

Rockland county health officials have added another free vaccine clinic as they grapple with the widening measles outbreak. With 46 cases of measles confirmed and 9 more suspected, officials consider "all of Rockland essentially exposed."

During these clinics, the Health Department and Refuah Health Center will be offering non-immune residents who are 6 months of age and older one dose of MMR vaccine at no cost.

Usually, children get their 1st measles vaccine at 12-15 months, but because of the outbreak health officials are urging that babies get their 1st MMR shot now, as younger children are more likely to get sicker.

Dr Patricia Schnabel Ruppert, Commissioner of the Rockland County Department of Health said at a press conference [Tue 30 Oct 2018], 2 children have already been hospitalized from this outbreak, and one is in intensive care.

Upcoming free measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine clinics are set for [locations listed at the source URL above.] People will be checked before entering to make sure they are not sick.

In addition, ALL schools within the village of New Square plus ANY school with less than a 70 percent MMR vaccination rate within Spring Valley and Monsey (the geographical area affected by the measles outbreak) will be required to keep un- or under-vaccinated students home until 21 days have passed since the last confirmed measles case in Rockland.

It could be months, officials acknowledged.

That's 16 schools with more than 1000 students.

This is in addition to the letter issued on [18 Oct 2018], to schools that were attended by students with confirmed cases of measles, requiring that un- or under-vaccinated students remain home.

So far, 2100 people have gotten vaccinated at the free clinics, officials said.

[Measles outbreak: now 46 confirmed cases in Rockland county, 328 868 population, New York, USA.

See Measles update (63): Americas, Europe, Africa 20181019.6101105: Meanwhile, health officials in Rockland County on [Wed 17 Oct 2018] said there were 7 confirmed cases, and an additional 8 suspected cases being investigated involving a mix of adults and children. Rockland officials say 5 of the sickened can be traced to recent travel to Israel. Also, 2 additional cases are from exposure that occurred in the county.

See Measles update (65): Africa, USA 20181025.6112636: The MMR vaccine clinics are in response to 15 confirmed cases to date in Rockland, said Rockland County Executive Ed Day and County Health Commissioner Dr Patricia Schnabel Ruppert. Now with 46 cases, officials are offering shots for babies as young as 6 months, because measles is more dangerous for little children.]

http://outbreaknewstoday.com/ukraine-moh-35000-measles-cases-year-11-children-died-63535/


Ukraine continues to report measles at high levels-more than 1300 cases reported in the past week -- and they continue to strongly encourage the public to get vaccinated, even calling immunization a matter of national security.

Since the beginning of the year [2018], 35 233 Ukrainians have suffered from measles and 15 people have died, including 11 children.

Health ministry officials say stopping the outbreak requires herd immunity, a level that has not been achieved. When at least 95 percent of Ukrainians are vaccinated against measles, the cases will go down and protection from the deadly disease will include those children and adults who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons.

The greatest increase in measles is observed in those areas where the level of coverage by the planned vaccination is the smallest: in the Ivano-Frankivsk, Transcarpathian [Zakarpattya], and Lviv oblasts.

Polish health officials are calling on people to vaccinate themselves and their children after measles cases were reported in the region around Warsaw.

Health Minister Lukasz Szumowski said 17 recent measles cases in the Mazovia province all resulted from parents failing to get their children vaccinated.

The Polish cases come as the World Health Organization has reported tens of thousands of measles cases across Europe.

At a news conference on [Sun 4 Nov 2018], Szumowski and other health officials stressed that measles vaccinations are safe.

Measles is a highly contagious disease and WHO says it is one of the leading causes of death worldwide in young children. It's easily prevented with a vaccine.

Authorities have confirmed the 1st case of measles registered in Valledupar. The secretary of Departmental Health, Nicolas Mohrez Muvdi, assured that it is an imported case that was registered in a 25-year-old young man, who was in a family integration in the corregimiento San Jose de Oriente, municipality of La Paz.

It was there where he had contact with a Venezuelan person who had the disease and who is presumed returned to his/her country.

Mohrez Muvdi explained that, "After several days, the young man presented the symptoms and went to a health center in the city of Valledupar, which immediately informed the health authorities about the suspected case."

On the other hand, the official stressed that the Valledupar case becomes the most recent case in the department [Cesar], "after 2 cases were confirmed in the municipality of Codazzi."

Among the measures carried out by the authorities is the vaccination strategy carried out in Valledupar, as explained by the local Health Secretary, Elba Yolanda Ustariz Martinez, who pointed out that "you have to be alert to the symptoms, such as high fever with rash, conjunctivitis, malaise, lack of appetite and nasal secretions."

Ustariz Martinez also recalled that the infection is transmitted from one person to another through droplets of saliva ejected by the patient when speaking or sneezing, "hence the importance of using masks, washing hands frequently, keeping the house ventilated, and, in the presence of those symptoms, not self-medicating but consulting a doctor immediately.

In the construction of the so-called shock plan, the authorities highlighted the active participation of the Eduardo Arredondo Daza Hospital as reinforcement was immediately initiated to expand vaccination coverage.

Both the departmental and municipal health secretaries emphasize the importance of applying the complete vaccination scheme. That is why they reiterate the call to parents to go to the nearest hospital. "We remind you that they are 2 doses of viral triple, at the 1st year of life and at 5 years."

In addition to this, because of the outbreak situation, the Ministry of Health orders that a double viral dose be given to the entire population between 6 months of age and 49 years of age; regardless of their nationality.
