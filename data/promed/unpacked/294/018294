AVIAN INFLUENZA, HUMAN (180): EGYPT

An Egyptian woman who had been in contact with sick birds died of the
avian influenza virus on Monday [31 Dec 2007], the 3rd death in the
most populous Arab country from bird flu in less than a week, the
Health Ministry said. The ministry said in a statement that the
woman, a resident of Menoufia province in the Nile Delta, was taken
to hospital on Saturday [29 Dec 2007] and died early on Monday [31
Dec 2008]. "She suffered from a high fever and difficulty breathing
and had a pulmonary infection after coming into contact with birds
suspected of being infected with avian flu," the statement said. "She
was placed on a respirator but died at dawn on Monday [31 Dec 2007]."
The death was the 18th bird flu fatality and the 43rd human case in
Egypt since the deadly H5N1 virus arrived in early 2006.
It came a day after a 25-year-old Egyptian woman died of bird flu in
the Nile Delta city of Mansoura. Another woman died of bird flu on
Wednesday [26 Dec 2007] in Beni Suef province south of Cairo.
It is the 3rd winter that the virus has struck after lying low during
Egypt's hot summers, when it is much less likely to spread from one
carrier to another. The government has promoted a poultry vaccination
programme but coercive measures are hard to enforce. Around 5 million
households in Egypt depend on poultry as a main source of food and
income, and the government has said this makes it unlikely the
disease can be eradicated.

[Three of the 43 cases of human H5N1 avian influenza recorded in
Egypt since the beginning of 2006, and 3 of the 18 deaths, have
occurred during the past 7 days. The 3 cases appear to be
unconnected. The high mortality rate is worrying in view of the
previous success of the Egyptian authorities in treating avian
influenza virus patients. Hopefully this is a statistical aberration
and it does not herald the appearance of a virus endowed with
enhanced virulence for humans.
