The Hellenic Center for Disease Prevention and Control (KEELPNO) on Wed [28 Dec 2016] issued an announcement noting a spike in recent weeks of cases of gastroenteritis, or stomach flu, in Greece and urged citizens to take basic precautions to avoid contagion.

Experts said the virus is contagious from the 1st appearance of symptoms -- stomach ache, diarrhea and/or vomiting -- and up to 3 days after they subside, advising people who believe they may be ill with stomach flu to avoid contact with babies and elderly or sick individuals.

[Although the etiology of this spike in gastroenteritis cases is not stated, it most likely is norovirus, the most common cause of viral gastroenteritis in humans, affecting people of all ages. Norovirus is highly infectious, being transmitted by eating food or drinking liquids that are contaminated with norovirus, touching surfaces or objects contaminated with norovirus then putting your fingers in your mouth, or having contact with someone who is infected with norovirus (for example, caring for or sharing food or eating utensils with someone with illness.

There have been a total of 163 hospital outbreaks reported so far this season, as a vomiting bug has resulted in more bed closures than this time last year [2015]. Hospital bed closures per day rose from an average of 559 to 699, compared with this time last year.

More patients have been struck down with vomiting bug norovirus this year [2016] compared with the previous 5 years, according to official figures.

Data from Public Health England show that reports of the bug had reached 2435 this winter [2016-17], 12% more than the average for the same period over the last 5 years. The figure is also 71% higher than the same period last year [2015], although last winter had unusually low levels of norovirus.

In the week ending on Christmas Day [2016], outbreaks of vomiting and diarrhoea resulted in more bed closures than during the same period last year, rising from an average of 559 beds closed per day to 699. Hospitals reported 20 outbreaks of norovirus in the 1st 2 weeks of December 2016, 17 of which led to bay or ward closures, and 13 of which were confirmed as the bug. In total so far this season, there have been 163 hospital outbreaks reported.

Nick Phin, deputy director of the national infection service at PHE, said: "Norovirus is a common cause of illness during winter. Exactly when the peak in activity occurs will be different each winter, but levels seen so far this year [2016] are not unexpected compared with the previous 5 years."

The number of laboratory reports of the bug rotavirus this season is 1136, which is also 3% higher than the average for the period from 2003 to 2013.

In early November [2016], the Mexican restaurant chain Wahaca closed several branches in London after more than 350 customers and staff fell ill with suspected norovirus. PHE and environmental health officers were called in after the suspected outbreak of the winter vomiting bug struck at 9 restaurants.

NHS England also released figures showing there were 291 808 calls to the NHS111 service in the week ending on Christmas Day, as temperatures plummeted and a cold weather alert was issued. This was nearly 9% lower than the number of calls to the helpline in the same week last year [2015]. Of calls answered, 93.2% were answered within 60 seconds, and 1.5% of patients abandoned their calls after waiting 30 seconds.

[Norovirus outbreaks are most common in winter and in such crowded settings as restaurants, cruise ships, and more. A paper from 2009 examined the complex interplay between host, viral and climatic factors driving norovirus epidemic patterns. They concluded that increases in norovirus are associated with cold, dry temperature, low population immunity, and the emergence of novel genogroup variants. (Lopman B, Armstrong B, Atchison C, Gray JJ. Host, weather and virological factors drive norovirus epidemiology: time-series analysis of laboratory surveillance data in England and Wales. PLoS One. 2009 Aug 24;4(8):e6671. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0006671.)
