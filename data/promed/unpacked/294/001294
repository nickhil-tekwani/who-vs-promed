The regional administration of agriculture in Tataouine received, since last Friday [13 May 2022], a notification of the death of 7 camels in the town of [Bir Lahmar], in the north east of the region, and in the towns of Remada and Smar, causing panic among the breeders. Death was sudden, according to eyewitnesses.

The head of the animal production department in Tataouine confirmed that the officials of the department immediately went to the scene of the accident, where the veterinarians diagnosed the death event and took the necessary samples to be presented for laboratory analysis, noting that the initial diagnosis highlighted the presence of a rapid rotting and swelling of the bodies.

According to the official, an autopsy was conducted, which revealed the presence of "a case of acute intestinal poisoning", according to the initial data. She pointed out that the autopsy also proved that the unbalanced diet of camels can be a major cause of poisoning cases, especially since the region is still suffering from severe drought, which prompted the breeders to resort to adopting another diet, which did not take the necessary precautions, adding that while awaiting the results of the analysis of the laboratory, which will reveal the main cause, the incident remains under investigation.

[Tataouine is the southernmost of Tunisia's 24 governorates, and also the largest. For the location of Bir Lahmar, in its north east, see map at https://tinyurl.com/y9evv3zu.

Information on the epidemiological and laboratory findings of the affected camels is requested.

One of the candidate etiologies coming to mind, in view of the peracute course of the fatal cases combined with their "unbalanced diet" and digestive tract changes, is enterotoxaemia. Enterotoxaemia is caused, globally, in different livestock species -- mainly in young sheep, but also in cattle, goats, and camels -- by _Clostridium perfringens_, of which several types and their respective toxins are known.
