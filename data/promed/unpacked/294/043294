Key points
- The French capital and parts of the north of the country will enter a new lockdown Friday [19 Mar 2021], although schools and essential shops will stay open.
- In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel had announced an easing of lockdowns in March [2021].
- But German Health Minister Jens Spahn told a news conference Friday [19 Mar 2021] that the easing may have to be reversed.

Warnings of an exponential rise in infections for Germany and a fresh monthlong lockdown in Paris have underlined the dire situation across Europe as the coronavirus surges once again. The variant first discovered in the UK is seen as the reason for the new spike. The strain is reported to be much more virulent than the original one.

The French capital and northern parts of the country will enter a new lockdown Friday [19 Mar 2021], although schools and essential shops will stay open. The country's 7-day average of new coronavirus cases rose above 25 000 this week for the 1st time since November [2020].

In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel had announced an easing of lockdowns in March [2021]. That was when the number of infections per 100 000 people over 7 days was at 65. But that number is now at 96, and there are real fears that infections at Easter could mirror what they were at Christmas.

"The rising case numbers may mean that we cannot take further opening steps in the weeks to come," German Health Minister Jens Spahn told a news conference Friday [19 Mar 2021], according to Reuters. "On the contrary, we may even have to take steps backwards."

Italy has already put Easter plans on hold with a new national lockdown announced by Prime Minister Mario Draghi. The country has the 6th-highest death toll in the world with at least 103 855 fatalities, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

Poland has also seen a huge surge in infections with approximately 52% of new cases linked to the variant from Britain, according to Reuters. Total cases for the country pushed passed 2 million on Friday [19 Mar 2021] with 25 998 in the last 24 hours.

The surge comes as EU nations try to press ahead with their vaccination campaigns, which have so far underperformed compared with the likes of those in the USA and the UK. Supply and procurement issues have been blamed and the rollout of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine was halted this week while the EU's health regulator, the European Medicines Agency, carried out an investigation into blood clots. On Friday [19 Mar 2021], Germany's Spahn also warned that there are not enough vaccines in Europe to prevent this 3rd wave.

[This 3rd wave is being attributed to the variant first identified in the UK, B.1.1.7.

"The coronavirus variant B.1.1.7 is associated with an estimated 64% higher risk of dying from COVID-19, suggests new research published in a peer-reviewed journal. A sample of people in the UK infected with the variant appeared to be between 32% and 104% -- so around a probable 64% -- more likely to die than those infected with the previously circulating variants, according to the study published in the medical journal the BMJ (Challen R, Brooks-Pollock E, Read JM, et al. Risk of mortality in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern 202012/1: matched cohort study. BMJ. 2021; 372: n579. https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.n579).

"The variant was originally found to be more easily transmissible and the new data support claims from UK officials, based on preliminary data, that the variant may be more deadly, as well. The researchers, from various institutions in the UK, analyzed data on more than 100 000 patients who tested positive for COVID-19 between October [2020] through January [2021], and were followed up with until mid-February [2021]" (https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/10/health/coronavirus-variant-uk-more-deadly-study/index.html).

The USA should be on alert and preparing for the same increase in cases. - Mod.LK]

[2] Variant updates
[A] India: Double mutation E484Q-L452R
Date: Wed 17 Mar 2021 02:14 IST

https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/covid-double-mutation-variant-fuels-fears/cid/1809715


Government researchers have found a coronavirus variant with 2 worrisome mutations in samples from Maharashtra and started epidemiological detective fieldwork to determine whether it has played any role in the COVID-19 resurgence there or in other states.

A 10-lab research consortium has alerted the Union health ministry that a variant with the mutations designated E484Q and L452R makes up about 20% of over 200 coronavirus genomes sequenced from some of Maharashtra's hardest-hit districts.

E484Q is what scientists call an escape mutation that allows the virus to evade some human immune responses. L452R has been shown by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, to increase infectivity of the virus.

Senior scientists with the consortium have asserted that there is no evidence yet to attribute the surge in Maharashtra to the variant, but the double mutation among the sequences has amplified suspicions that a more infectious variant capable of evading immune responses might be at play.

Epidemiologists at the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) -- the nodal centre for the Indian SARS-Cov-2 Genomics Consortium -- and scientists in partner labs are looking for connections, if any, between the double mutation and infection patterns in Maharashtra or other states.

"We're searching for answers," a consortium scientist told The Telegraph. "Are fractions of cases with the double mutation increasing over time? Is the double mutation appearing in clusters of cases? Is it associated with rapid infection spread? Is it causing reinfections in previously infected people?"

Health authorities have so far attributed Maharashtra's more than 4-fold increase in average daily new cases over the past month -- 3051 on 15 Feb to 15 051 on 15 Mar [2021] -- to laxity in wearing masks and avoiding crowds and poor efforts to test and isolate cases and quarantine contacts.

Maharashtra's 2nd wave alongside rising counts in Gujarat, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Punjab have more than doubled India's daily new cases from around 11 200 in mid-February [2021] to over 23 000 on Tuesday [16 Mar 2021], raising fears of a 2nd nationwide wave.

Health experts say whether variants have played a role in the surge or not, it is critical to control the human factors driving the growth. "The solutions remain the same -- wearing masks, avoiding crowds, aggressive testing, contact tracing and other containment measures," one state adviser said.

The L452 mutation has been implicated in multiple outbreaks in California where, the consortium's scientists said, its frequency among sequenced genomes had increased from 0% in September 2020 to over 50% in January 2021.

"I think the signals from California and the surge in Maharashtra are enough indications to consider the variant with the double mutation as a likely variant of concern that must be investigated deeper," said a senior scientist.

The NCDC, which maintains a nationwide disease surveillance network, and the National Centre for Cell Science, Pune, procured samples collected in districts from Maharashtra over the past 2 months and sequenced the genomes, collaborating with researchers at the CSIR Institute for Genomics and Integrative Biology, New Delhi.

Senior epidemiologists have suggested that there is an urgent need to determine who is getting infected in the worst-affected districts. One option would be to simultaneously perform a blood test looking for antibodies while taking throat swabs to diagnose the infection, an epidemiologist said.

"In a large sample, if we find infections without antibodies, we'll know the virus is spreading only among susceptible people. But if we find the virus in some people with antibodies, we'll know people previously infected are turning up positive," the expert said. "We need such studies immediately."

While E484Q had turned up in 11 countries and L452R had been detected in 20 countries by mid-February [2021], scientists say this is likely the 1st time the 2 have been documented as a double mutation in a variant.

The Centre had in December [2020] -- amid signals of potentially troubling variants emerging in the UK and South Africa -- announced that the consortium would sequence coronavirus genomes from 5% of positive samples across the country.

The consortium has bolstered sequencing efforts. The NCDC and 9 partner labs have collectively sequenced over 7000 genomes since mid-January [2021], nearly as many as different scientific groups across the country had sequenced from April to December [2020].

All viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19, acquire genetic mutations over time, most of them random changes that do not benefit the virus in any way. Some mutations, however, might make the virus more infectious or evade immune responses. Over the past 6 months, variants of concern -- either more infectious or capable of evading antibodies -- have emerged in the UK, South Africa and Brazil, among other countries.

"Even if the E484Q-L452R double mutation variant turns out to be a variant of concern, the numbers for now suggest that 80% sequences sampled are other variants -- and public health response doesn't change in any way," said the director of one of the consortium's labs in southern India.

A public health expert said the current surge can't be just "wished away" as large numbers of people are infected. "Rigorous testing, isolation of cases, house-to-house surveillance, and quarantine on contacts can curb the spread," the expert said. "But it could take 3 to 6 weeks, but much will depend on how efficiently these things are done."

[B] Philippines
Date: Thu 18 Mar 2021 07:00 EST
Source: Forbes [edited]
https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamhaseltine/2021/03/18/third-generation-covid-19-variant-described-in-the-philippines/


A new SARS-CoV-2 variant has emerged once again, this time in the Philippines. The new variant bears a resemblance to the recently discovered [variant in Japan (B.1.1.248)] and the infamous [variant (P.1) from Brazil], known for its dangerous immune-escape capabilities. B.1.1.248 and the [variant (P.3) from the Philippines] seem to be 2nd- and 3rd-generation descendants of P.1. Here, we will detail the similarities that P.3 shares with its virological ancestors and other variants, as well as the unique mutations added to the genome.

First discovered in the Central Visayas region, researchers analyzed 33 samples from the University of the Philippines collected from late January to early February 2021. Their genome sequencing efforts and following report denote 13 lineage-defining mutations, which likely have serious biological significance. Among these mutations are several shared by B.1.1.248 and P.1. These variants could be a blueprint for the biological implications of the P.3 mutations.

We see several mutations that the novice virologist keeping up with variants should find familiar within the spike protein. The most widespread is at position 614 (D614G), which emerged in late spring and early summer [2020]. This mutation resulted in increased transmissibility, which was one of the drivers behind the summer proliferation of SARS-CoV-2.

Following in prevalence are point mutations at placements 484 (E484K), 501 (N501Y), and 1176 (P1176F). The mutations E484K and N501Y are seen in the P.1 and B.1.1.248 and many other strains, but P1176F is exclusive to the [variant from Japan]. Studies have shown the P.1 is highly resistant to neutralizing antibodies, whether from vaccines or natural infection. Mutations to the receptor-binding domain, the mechanism which connects to the ACE2 receptor of the human cell, likely drive this resistance.

The mutation P1176F was seemingly unique to B.1.1.248 until the discovery of P.3. The mutation is located between heptad repeats 1 and 2. The heptad repeats provide structure to the spike protein. One study, which tested different antibodies on different sections of the spike protein, found substantial neutralizing activities in region 1029 to 1192, of which 1176 falls. This suggests this region of the spike carries neutralizing epitopes and is vital for virus entry to host cells. A mutation to this placement may bolster resistance to neutralization, making these variants all the more resistant to antibodies.

The P.3 variant additionally contains unique spike mutations, notably at placements 1092 (E1092K) and 1101 (H1101Y). These fall in the same region as P1176F and may contribute to further neutralization escape. P.3 also carries 3 deletions (141-143) and a point mutation at placement 94 (S94F). These mutations fall in the N-terminal domain. This highly antigenic structure is the target of a number of antibodies. The figure below models all mutations to the spike protein in the P.3 variant. Altogether, these mutations may bolster immune evasion even further, creating a formidable challenge for naturally developed antibodies from previous infections and the current generation of vaccines.

External to the spike protein, we again see many shared and unique mutations. In conjunction with D614G, a mutation to non-structural protein 12 (P323L) is widely dispersed among different variants. It likely enhances the capabilities of the polymerase, which is the mechanism that oversees viral replication. In NSP13, there are 3 unique mutations affecting the helicase, which aids in the replication process. These mutations likely also enhance this process, perhaps leading to increased viral load within the host body.

Further mutations to the nucleocapsid protein and open reading frame 8 likely increase the virus's virulence, as similar mutations have been seen in other variants. The collection of mutations to the whole genome can be seen in the figure below [see source URL].

In all likelihood, P.3 is a lineage of B.1.1.248. The [variant from Japan] was initially recorded from travelers going from Brazil to Japan. Those travelers had developed a lineage of P.1 with several unique mutations. Some weeks later, the University of the Philippines discovered a lineage of that strain that again had developed mutations of its own. Therefore, P.3 is a 3rd-generation variant of P.1.

This example goes to show the flexibility and extent of variant capabilities. Vaccines currently in distribution are much less capable of garnering neutralization in the [strains from South Africa and Brazil]. Recently released data on the AstraZeneca vaccine indicate neutralization efficacy of only 10%. This is notable as the [variants from Brazil, Japan, and now the Philippines] all bear significant commonality with the [variant from South Africa]. There is a substantial possibility that the vaccine would struggle with these other variants as well.

Development of new vaccines to cater to these variants is already underway. However, who is to say that those 2nd-generation vaccines will be capable of neutralizing the [variants from Japan or the Philippines]? Perhaps then a 3rd-generation vaccine will be developed, and the game of whack-a-mole continues.

What these variants and others around the world are underlining is the importance of not only accelerating vaccination distribution today, but also ramping up 2nd- and 3rd-generation vaccines that will be stronger, act longer, and cover broader in their protection spectrum.

At a certain point, we must realize that public health measures must fill in the gaps left by vaccine-evasive variants. Public health measures must be continued everywhere in conjunction with vaccines. To lose all the progress vaccines may grant in 6 to 12 months would be a devastating blow for those ready to resume everyday life.

[3] AstraZeneca vaccine
[A] European Medicines Agency (EMA)
Date: Thu 18 Mar 2021
Source: European Medicines Agency [edited]
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca-benefits-still-outweigh-risks-despite-possible-link-rare-blood-clots


EMA's safety committee, PRAC [Pandemic Response Accountability Committee], concluded its preliminary review of a signal of blood clots in people vaccinated with COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca at its extraordinary meeting of 18 Mar 2021. The Committee confirmed that:

- the benefits of the vaccine in combating the still widespread threat of COVID-19 (which itself results in clotting problems and may be fatal) continue to outweigh the risk of side effects;
- the vaccine is not associated with an increase in the overall risk of blood clots (thromboembolic events) in those who receive it;
- there is no evidence of a problem related to specific batches of the vaccine or to particular manufacturing sites;
- however, the vaccine may be associated with very rare cases of blood clots associated with thrombocytopenia, i.e., low levels of blood platelets (elements in the blood that help it to clot) with or without bleeding, including rare cases of clots in the vessels draining blood from the brain (CVST).

These are rare cases -- around 20 million people in the UK and EEA had received the vaccine as of 16 Mar [2021] and EMA had reviewed only 7 cases of blood clots in multiple blood vessels (disseminated intravascular coagulation, DIC) and 18 cases of CVST. A causal link with the vaccine is not proven but is possible and deserves further analysis.

The PRAC involved experts in blood disorders in its review and worked closely with other health authorities including the UK's MHRA [Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency], which has experience with administration of this vaccine to around 11 million people. Overall, the number of thromboembolic events reported after vaccination, both in studies before licensing and in reports after rollout of vaccination campaigns (469 reports, 191 of them from the EEA), was lower than that expected in the general population. This allows the PRAC to confirm that there is no increase in overall risk of blood clots. However, in younger patients there remain some concerns, related in particular to these rare cases.

The Committee's experts looked in extreme detail at records of DIC and CVST reported from Member States, 9 of which resulted in death. Most of these occurred in people under 55 and the majority were women. Because these events are rare, and COVID-19 itself often causes blood clotting disorders in patients, it is difficult to estimate a background rate for these events in people who have not had the vaccine. However, based on pre-COVID figures it was calculated that less than one reported case of DIC might have been expected by 16 Mar [2021] among people under 50 within 14 days of receiving the vaccine, whereas 5 cases had been reported. Similarly, on average 1.35 cases of CVST might have been expected among this age-group, whereas by the same cut-off date there had been 12. A similar imbalance was not visible in the older population given the vaccine.

The Committee was of the opinion that the vaccine's proven efficacy in preventing hospitalisation and death from COVID-19 outweighs the extremely small likelihood of developing DIC or CVST. However, in the light of its findings, patients should be aware of the remote possibility of such syndromes, and if symptoms suggestive of clotting problems occur, patients should seek immediate medical attention and inform healthcare professionals of their recent vaccination. Steps are already being taken to update the product information for the vaccine to include more information on these risks.

The PRAC will undertake additional review of these risks, including looking at the risks with other types of COVID-19 vaccines (although no signal has been identified from monitoring so far). Close safety monitoring of reports of blood clotting disorders will continue, and further studies are being instituted to provide more laboratory data as well as real-world evidence. EMA will communicate further as appropriate.

Information for patients
- COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca is not associated with an increased overall risk of blood clotting disorders.
- There have been very rare cases of unusual blood clots accompanied by low levels of blood platelets (components that help blood to clot) after vaccination. The reported cases were almost all in women under 55.
- Because COVID-19 can be so serious and is so widespread, the benefits of the vaccine in preventing it outweigh the risks of side effects.
- However, if you get any of the following after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca -- breathlessness, pain in the chest or stomach, swelling or coldness in an arm or leg, severe or worsening headache or blurred vision after vaccination, persistent bleeding, multiple small bruises, reddish or purplish spots, or blood blisters under the skin -- please seek prompt medical assistance and mention your recent vaccination.

Information for healthcare professionals
- Cases of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia, some presenting as mesenteric vein or cerebral vein/cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, have been reported in persons who had recently received COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca, mostly occurring within 14 days after vaccination. The majority of reports involved women under 55, although some of this may reflect greater exposure of such individuals due to targeting of particular populations for vaccine campaigns in different Member States.
- The number of reported events exceeds those expected, and causality, although not confirmed, cannot therefore be excluded. However, given the rarity of the events, and the difficulty of establishing baseline incidence since COVID-19 itself is resulting in hospitalisations with thromboembolic complications, the strength of any association is uncertain.
- EMA considers that the benefit-risk balance of the medicine remains positive, and there is no association with thromboembolic disorders overall. However, steps will be taken to update the SmPC and package leaflet with information on cases of DIC and CVST that have occurred.
- Healthcare professionals are urged to be alert for possible cases of thromboembolism, DIC or CVST occurring in vaccinated individuals.
- Recipients should be warned to seek immediate medical attention for symptoms of thromboembolism, and especially signs of thrombocytopenia and cerebral blood clots such as easy bruising or bleeding, and persistent or severe headache, particularly beyond 3 days after vaccination.

A direct healthcare professional communication (DHPC) will be sent to healthcare professionals prescribing, dispensing or administering the medicine. The DHPC will also be published on a dedicated page on the EMA website (https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/human-regulatory/post-authorisation/pharmacovigilance/direct-healthcare-professional-communications).

More about the medicine
COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca is a vaccine for preventing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in people aged 18 years and older. COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus. COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca is made up of another virus (of the adenovirus family) that has been modified to contain the gene for making a protein from SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca does not contain the virus itself and cannot cause COVID-19.

The most common side effects with COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca are usually mild or moderate and improve within a few days after vaccination.

More about the procedure
The review of thromboembolic events with COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca was carried out in the context of a safety signal, under an accelerated timetable. A safety signal is information on a new or incompletely documented adverse event that is potentially caused by a medicine such as a vaccine and that warrants further investigation.

The review was carried out by EMA's Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC), the Committee responsible for the evaluation of safety issues for human medicines. EMA's human medicine committee, CHMP, will now rapidly assess any necessary changes to the product information.

[B] WHO statement on AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine safety
Date: Wed 17 Mar 2021
Source: WHO [edited]
https://www.who.int/news/item/17-03-2021-who-statement-on-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-safety-signals


Some countries in the European Union have temporarily suspended use of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine as a precautionary measure based on reports of rare blood coagulation disorders in persons who had received the vaccine. Other countries in the EU -- having considered the same information -- have decided to continue using the vaccine in their immunization programmes.

Vaccination against COVID-19 will not reduce illness or deaths from other causes. Thromboembolic events are known to occur frequently. Venous thromboembolism is the 3rd most common cardiovascular disease globally.

In extensive vaccination campaigns, it is routine for countries to signal potential adverse events following immunization. This does not necessarily mean that the events are linked to vaccination itself, but it is good practice to investigate them. It also shows that the surveillance system works and that effective controls are in place.

WHO is in regular contact with the European Medicines Agency and regulators around the world for the latest information on COVID-19 vaccine safety. The WHO COVID-19 Subcommittee of the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety is carefully assessing the latest available safety data for the AstraZeneca vaccine. Once that review is completed, WHO will immediately communicate the findings to the public.

At this time, WHO considers that the benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine outweigh its risks and recommends that vaccinations continue.

[C] AstraZeneca vaccine-related blood clotting
Date: Fri 19 Mar 2021
Source: Deutsche Welle (DW) [edited]
https://m.dw.com/en/astrazeneca-german-team-discovers-thrombosis-trigger/a-56925550?maca=en-newsletter_en_bulletin-2097-xml-newsletter&r=57178781595420742&lid=1785942&pm_ln=82970


Researchers at the Greifswald teaching hospital in northern Germany said on Friday [19 Mar 2021] that they had discovered the cause of the unusual blood clotting found in some recipients of the AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine, public broadcaster Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR) reported. The investigation showed how the vaccine caused rare thrombosis in the brain in a small number of patients.

The discovery means that targeted treatment can be offered to those who suffer similar clotting, using a very common medication. The success was a result of cooperation between the Greifswald hospital, state health regulator the Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI), as well as doctors in Austria -- a nurse there died from thrombosis in the brain after being vaccinated with the AstraZeneca jab.

The researchers emphasized that treatment would only be possible in patients where blood clots appear, rather than as a preventative treatment. The information has been shared with hospitals around Europe.

Symptoms like continuous headache, dizziness or impaired vision lasting more than 3 days after vaccination need further medical check-ups, according to the German Research Association for Thrombosis and Hemostasis in a statement on the recent findings.

The Greifswald findings have not yet been published in a scientific journal and therefore have not been reviewed by independent experts. The Paul Ehrlich Institute in Germany is now looking into the scientists' work.

Germany, along with several other EU member states, suspended the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine on Monday [15 Mar 2021] following reports of unusual blood clots. On Thursday [18 Mar 2021], the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said that there were no proven links between the vaccine and the clots, based on the information they had. They also stated that the benefits of the jab outweighed any possible risks.

In response to the updated guidance, Germany was set to restart vaccinations with the British-Swedish jab on Friday [19 Mar 2021]. By Thursday [18 Mar 2021], Germany had administered over 10 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines, including the AstraZeneca vaccine.
