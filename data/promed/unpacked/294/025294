Northern California residents asked to remove bird feeders
-----------------------------------------------
Northern California residents are being asked to remove bird feeders
from their property for at least a month to help slow an outbreak of
an avian disease, the California Department of Fish and Game
announced today [13 Feb 2005].
Scientists hope the measure will control the spread of salmonellosis,
a disease affecting birds known as pine siskins, which primarily live
in wooded areas from Grass Valley to Eureka, state Wildlife
Veterinarian Pam Swift reported. Swift warns that communities in the
Bay Area also are affected by the outbreak.
Pine siskins are small, brown, streaked birds with yellow patches on
the wings and tail, according to Swift. They are commonly seen at
feeders and birdbaths.
The California West Nile virus hotline has received numerous calls
from concerned residents reporting dead pine siskins in forested
areas throughout the northern portion of the state. Salmonellosis is
a bacterial disease that is not related to West Nile virus.
The disease could also affect humans, and residents are warned to use
caution around birdfeeders and birdbaths, according to Swift.
After the moratorium on bird feeding is lifted, the department
suggests that residents replace all food in birdfeeders and water in
birdbaths daily; decontaminate all feeders by using a 10 percent
solution of household bleach in water; spread small amounts of seed
over a large area in the sun to avoid encouraging a concentration of
birds at one site; replace wooden bird feeders with plastic or metal
that don't harbor the bacteria and can be sterilized easily; and use
gloves and anti-bacterial soap when handling dead birds and bird
feeders.

[People should be especially careful to wear gloves and wash their
hands after cleaning the feeders. Salmonella is most often ingested
through contaminated food products, but may be transmitted through
unsanitary hand contact with the face.
Salmonella is most often associated with gastrointestinal upset and
diarrhea in people. - Mod.TG]
