Downy mildew disease, caused by _Peronospora farinosa_ f. sp.
_spinaciae_ is the most important disease facing the extensive spinach
industry in California.

In recent years, several new downy mildew races have appeared in the
state in rapid succession, raising great concerns about the ability to
manage this threat and causing the industry to consider research
strategies to address the problem.

The major concern is the recent proliferation of races. While downy
mildew has been around California spinach fields for decades, the last
few years have seen the development of 4 or 5 new races. Each new race
potentially overcomes the resistance factors in the cultivars being
planted at that time, leaving the crop susceptible to severe damage.

More research is needed regarding basic biology of the mildew, disease
development, inoculum sources, role of seedborne downy mildew, sources
of genetic resistance of spinach, and improved fungicides. Integrated
management steps must be used.

[Downy mildew caused by _Peronospora farinosa_ f.sp. _spinaciae_ (also
called blue mould) is often considered the most widespread and
destructive spinach disease worldwide. The fungus is specific to
spinach and a few weeds of the genus _Chenopodium_. It survives
between crops as spores in soil or mycelium on seeds. Symptoms include
spots on the upper leaf surfaces which can become necrotic and lead to
leaf distortion, and "downy" growth on the leaf undersides. Infected
plants are unmarketable; their taste is altered even when used as
tinned food. Disease development is favoured by cool, humid conditions
and mostly occurs in young plants. Spread within a crop may occur by
mechanical means, wind and splashing water.

Disease management includes fungicides, crop rotation, and cultural
practices to minimise inoculum and reduce free moisture in the crop.
Previously, cultivars with single-gene resistance to a given pathogen
race were used. However, these cultivars are increasingly succumbing
to new races emerging in Europe, the Americas and Japan.
