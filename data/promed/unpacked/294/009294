According to a Bomet district councillor, Alfred Cheramgoi, there were 10
cholera deaths during the week prior to 12 April in Kapkelei Location, Danai,
Bomet District, Kenya. Mr. Cheramgoi said that death came quickly to the
victims: within 6 hours after the onset of vomiting and diarrhea. The
majority of district residents have been severely weakened by famine.
