Scientists investigating a mystery illness which has killed scores of
dogs in Norfolk and further a field say it's not caused by plants.

Some believe the illness -- dubbed seasonal canine illness, or SCI --
was caused by bracken spores or fungi, because it seems to affect dogs
which have been walked in woods.

Pets have become ill and died after being walked on the Royal Estate,
at Sandringham, and in Thetford Forest.

But as the 1st cases of 2011 begin to appear, a botanist working with
the Animal Health Trust (AHT), which is investigating SCI, said he had
ruled out plants.

After visiting Sandringham, where a number of cases were reported last
month [September 2011], Dr Mark Spencer, of the Natural History
Museum, said there was no obvious evidence of any plants which would
cause clinical signs of the disease through contact alone.

He said he was confident that there was nothing unusual in the
woodlands and that all plants would probably have been growing there
for more than 50 years.

Possible causes which are now being considered less likely include
blue-green algae, non-native plants, bracken or fern spores and fungi.
Animal Health Trust scientist Dr Richard Newton said: "As with any
investigation, this is a process of elimination. Whilst we're not
ruling plants and these other toxic causes out completely, we are now
focusing our efforts on looking at other natural sources, such as
animal related factors."

The AHT is now enlisting the help of other specialist scientists to
help track down the cause of SCI.

Dr Newton said: "We have had more cases of SCI reported to us in
September 2011 than we had in September 2010. We believe this is
because people are more aware of the illness and our investigation. We
have also added an additional study site to our investigation
following a number of reports, from vets and dog owners, of SCI
cases."

Rendlesham Forest, near Woodbridge in Suffolk, has been added to the
AHT's investigation sites, with a dedicated questionnaire now
available for dog walkers that visit this location.

The other sites for which study questionnaires are available are the
Sandringham Estate and Thetford Forest in Norfolk, and Clumber Park
and Sherwood Forest in Nottinghamshire.

The AHT warns dog owners should remain vigilant and access veterinary
treatment if their dog vomits, has diarrhoea or is excessively tired
within 24 hours of walking in woodland.

[This article seems odd. The article reports that it cannot be bracken
fern as it has been there for so long, and then later, the article
indicates bracken fern is not being ruled out.

When this was 1st published on ProMED-mail, there was no mention of
the dogs drinking or swimming in water. For the cause to be blue-green
algae they would have to drink or swim in the water. Further, the same
weather conditions would have to exist at the same time each year for
this to be caused by blue green algae. And apparently, as this is
seasonal, it is occurring at approximately the same time each year. -
