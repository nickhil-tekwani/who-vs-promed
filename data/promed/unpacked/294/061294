Unless verified and diagnosed by postmortem examination with ancillary diagnostics, it seems premature and inappropriate to make claims that dogs (NC dog and NY German shepherd) are dying of COVID-19. I cannot argue with the positive test results; however, coronavirus infection and coronavirus disease should not be considered synonymous.

Any animal, domestic or free ranging, that dies with a historical positive coronavirus test should undergo a full postmortem examination by a veterinary pathologist. Only then can such statements like "...dog died from coronavirus [COVID-19] complications..." actually be verified. Until this happens, these statements continue to create confusion and panic. The factual information gained from a postmortem examination can then benefit the veterinary community and pet owners.

[Dr. Struthers makes a very valid point regarding the difference in coronavirus infection and coronavirus disease.

A canine coronavirus infection (CCV) is a highly contagious intestinal disease that can be found in dogs all around the world. This particular virus is specific to dogs, both wild and domestic. The coronavirus replicates itself inside the small intestine and is limited to the upper 2/3 of the small intestine and local lymph nodes. A CCV infection is generally considered to be a relatively mild disease with sporadic symptoms, or none at all. But if a CCV infection occurs simultaneously with a viral canine parvovirus infection, or an infection caused by other intestinal (enteric) pathogens, the consequences can be much more serious. There have been some deaths reported in vulnerable puppies (https://www.petmd.com/dog/conditions/digestive/c_dg_canine_coronavirus_infection).

I am unaware of a coronavirus test for dogs distinguishing between these coronas.

While it may be difficult to convince an owner whose pet has died to opt for a necropsy, it is the only way, presently, to make a truly accurate diagnosis. Consequently, stories about a dog dying from coronavirus complications is only a sensational article without much fact. - Mod.TG
