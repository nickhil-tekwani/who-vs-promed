--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Background
----------
WHO has called for increased testing in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, but countries have taken different approaches and the effectiveness of alternative strategies is unknown. We aimed to investigate the potential impact of different testing and isolation strategies on transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Methods
-------
We developed a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission based on infectiousness and PCR test sensitivity over time since infection. We estimated the reduction in the effective reproduction number (R) achieved by testing and isolating symptomatic individuals, regular screening of high-risk groups irrespective of symptoms, and quarantine of contacts of laboratory-confirmed cases identified through test-and-trace protocols. The expected effectiveness of different testing strategies was defined as the percentage reduction in R. We reviewed data on the performance of antibody tests reported by the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics and examined their implications for the use of so-called immunity passports.

Findings
--------
If all individuals with symptoms compatible with COVID-19 self-isolated and self-isolation was 100% effective in reducing onwards transmission, self-isolation of symptomatic individuals would result in a reduction in R of 47% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 32-55). PCR testing to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection soon after symptom onset could reduce the number of individuals needing to self-isolate, but would also reduce the effectiveness of self-isolation (around 10% would be false negatives). Weekly screening of health-care workers and other high-risk groups irrespective of symptoms by use of PCR testing is estimated to reduce their contribution to SARS-CoV-2 transmission by 23% (95% UI 16-40), on top of reductions achieved by self-isolation following symptoms, assuming results are available at 24 h. The effectiveness of test and trace depends strongly on coverage and the timeliness of contact tracing, potentially reducing R by 26% (95% UI 14-35) on top of reductions achieved by self-isolation following symptoms if 80% of cases and contacts are identified and there is immediate testing following symptom onset and quarantine of contacts within 24 h. Among currently available antibody tests, performance has been highly variable, with specificity around 90% or lower for rapid diagnostic tests and 95-99% for laboratory-based ELISA and chemiluminescent assays.

Interpretation
--------------
Molecular testing can play an important role in prevention of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, especially among health-care workers and other high-risk groups, but no single strategy will reduce R below 1 at current levels of population immunity. Immunity passports based on antibody tests or tests for infection face substantial technical, legal, and ethical challenges.

[The most commonly used and reliable test for diagnosis of COVID-19 has been the RT-PCR test performed using nasopharyngeal swabs or other upper respiratory tract specimens, including throat swab or, more recently, saliva. A variety of RNA gene targets are used by different manufacturers, with most tests targeting 1 or more of the envelope (env), nucleocapsid (N), spike (S), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and ORF1 genes. The sensitivities of the tests to individual genes are comparable according to comparison studies except for the RdRp-SARSr (Charite) primer probe, which has a slightly lower sensitivity
(https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2765837).

COVID-19 infection can also be detected indirectly by measuring the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Serological diagnosis is especially important for patients with mild to moderate illness who may present late, beyond the 1st 2 weeks of illness onset. Serological diagnosis is also becoming an important tool to understand the extent of COVID-19 transmission in the community and to identify individuals who are immune and potentially "protected" from becoming infected.

The time course of PCR positivity and seroconversion may vary in children and other groups, including the large population of asymptomatic individuals who go undiagnosed without active surveillance.

In order to have a successful 'test and trace' strategy for containing COVID-19 transmission, it is imperative that testing is conducted as early as possible and, despite its many imperfections, RT PCR would be the go to test if the individual is to be ruled in or out as a confirmed case. - Mod.UBA]

- 12:20 GMT -- Scotland says not yet safe to lift COVID-19 restrictions in Aberdeen
Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says it is not yet safe to lift additional COVID-19 restrictions in Aberdeen following an outbreak there, but the situation in the city is improving. "While the situation is undoubtedly improving, and I don't want to lose sight of that point, we are not yet in a position to say that this outbreak is over, or completely under control," Sturgeon said. She said she hoped some of the additional restrictions imposed on the city could begin being lifted next Wednesday [?26 Aug 2020].

- 11:40 GMT -- Czechs will not take part in WHO's coronavirus vaccine programme. The Czech Republic will not take part in the World Health Organization-led COVAX plan to develop and distribute a vaccine against COVID-19, Health Minister Adam Vojtech has said. "We will not join the WHO initiative for various reasons, the rules are less favourable for us than being part of the European initiative," he told reporters.
"We are going with the initiative by the European Commission, which is negotiating with producers, and the negotiations are very advanced, we will very soon take part in (an agreement) with AstraZeneca."

- 10:19 GMT -- Iran coronavirus death toll passes 20,000
Iran surpassed 20 000 confirmed deaths from the coronavirus on Wednesday [19 Aug 2020], the health ministry said -- the highest death toll for any Middle East country so far in the pandemic. The announcement came as the country, which has been struggling with both the region's largest outbreak and the highest number of deaths, went ahead with university entrance exams for more than one million students.

- 09:15 GMT -- Singapore says migrant dorms free of coronavirus after outbreak
A network of crowded dormitories where coronavirus transmissions flourished among migrant workers has been declared virus-free by Singaporean authorities. 86 percent of the migrant workers living in the affected dormitories have been cleared to return to work, the ministry said, though it warned small outbreaks remain likely.
About 300 000 male migrant workers live in crowded dormitories, facilitating easy transmission of the highly-contagious coronavirus.

- 08:50 GMT -- Musician with albinism says coronavirus raises risk of attack
The coronavirus pandemic has left people with albinism in fear of attack and murder in parts of Africa where their body parts are used for lucky charms, a Zambian musician with the condition has said.
The 35-year-old musician said there had already been one murder in Zambia since the virus emerged and the grave of a person with albinism had been dug up and body parts were stolen. Another man was reportedly attacked in the capital Lusaka last week [week of 10 Aug 2020]. In West Africa, [the musician] said people with albinism had also been blamed for COVID-19.
Albinism -- a lack of pigmentation in the skin, hair, and eyes -- affects up to one in 15 000 people in sub-Saharan Africa, according to the United Nations.

- 07:32 GMT -- Finland imposes 'Europe's tightest' border restrictions
Finland has removed most EU countries from its "green travel list", with only arrivals from a handful of states now able to enter the country without restrictions, the government announced.
The tougher rules, aimed at halting the spread of the coronavirus, mean only people coming from Italy, Hungary, Slovakia, Estonia, and Lithuania will now be allowed into Finland without proving they have a valid reason for travel and self-isolating for 2 weeks. Arrivals from a number of non-EU countries including Georgia, Rwanda, and South Korea continue to be freely permitted under the measures which will come into force next Monday [24 Aug 2020].
Since June [2020], the government has said it will allow arrivals from countries with fewer than 8 new coronavirus cases per 100 000 population in the last 2 weeks, although ministers have now made exceptions for countries with less than 10 cases.

- 06:22 GMT -- UK expands COVID-19 national testing study
The British government has said it will expand its COVID-19 national testing study, with an aim of reaching 400 000 people to provide weekly data on the spread of the infection and better locate future local outbreaks.
The Department of Health and Social Care said in a statement it would initially test 150 000 people in England every 2 weeks by October [2020], up from 28 000 people now, aiming to eventually reach 400 000 across the United Kingdom.
The testing survey, undertaken by the Office for National Statistics, would also be extended to Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.

- 04:40 GMT -- China and US to double flights between the 2 countries
After curbing travel between the 2 countries because of the coronavirus pandemic, China and the United States are beginning to ease restrictions.
The US Department of Transportation says it will allow the 4 Chinese passenger airlines currently flying to the US to double flights to 8 weekly round-trips, as China agrees to allow US carriers to double their flights to China.
US carriers voluntarily halted flights to China after the coronavirus outbreak. President Donald Trump, on [31 Jan 2020], barred nearly all non-US citizens from travelling to the US from China.

- 03:20 GMT -- Brazil gives nod to final-stage trials for Johnson & Johnson vaccine
Brazil's health regulator has approved final-stage trials for Johnson & Johnson's experimental coronavirus vaccine -- the 4th to get the nod for testing in the country.
The vaccine will be tested on 7000 volunteers across 7 states, Anvisa, the health regulator, said in a statement.
Brazil has the world's 2nd-biggest caseload for COVID-19 and has recorded nearly 110 000 deaths from the disease.

- 02:50 GMT -- Indigenous protesters resume Amazon roadblock
Indigenous protesters have resumed a roadblock of a key highway through the Amazon rainforest despite a judge ordering them to dismantle the blockade.
The protesters from the Kayapo Mekranoti ethnic group want help to fight the coronavirus and an end to illegal mining and deforestation.
Indigenous people have been among the groups worst affected by the coronavirus in Brazil with at least 21 000 diagnosed with the disease and 618 related deaths reported.

- 02:45 GMT -- Australia PM says COVID-19 vaccine should be compulsory
Prime Minister Scott Morrison says the coronavirus vaccine should be compulsory for all Australians with only limited medical exceptions.
He told local radio station 3AW the vaccine should be "as mandatory as you can possibly make it" and the stakes were too high to allow the disease to continue to spread.

- 01:40 GMT -- Global caseload exceeds 22 million
More than 22 million cases of the novel coronavirus have now been reported around the world, according to Johns Hopkins University.
The 1st cases were reported in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year [2019].
The US has now confirmed the most cases, followed by Brazil, India, Russia, and South Africa. The US has also recorded the most deaths.

Coronavirus cases
US: 5 481 557
Brazil: 3 407 354
India: 2 702 742
Russia: 930 276
South Africa: 592 144

Coronavirus deaths
US: 171 687
Brazil: 109 888
Mexico: 57 023
India: 51 797
UK: 41 466

- 01:30 GMT -- New cases in South Korea reach 5-month high
South Korea has reported the highest number of new coronavirus cases since March [2020], many traced to churches in Seoul.
The country added 297 cases: including 283 that were locally transmitted: the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Wednesday [19 Aug 2020]. That is the most since [8 Mar 2020], according to Yonhap news agency.
The spike prompted authorities to tighten restrictions. Outdoor gatherings are now limited to 100 people and indoor ones to 50 and venues seen as high-risk, including karaoke lounges and nightclubs, have been closed. Churches in Seoul and surrounding areas have been told to stop in-person services.

- 00:05 GMT: -- Australia's Victoria state reports 216 new coronavirus cases, 12 deaths
Australia's 2nd-most populous state of Victoria says 12 people have died from the new coronavirus in the last 24 hours and reported 216 new cases.
Victoria reported 222 cases a day earlier, its lowest one-day rise in a month, and 17 deaths. The state is the epicentre of Australia's latest COVID-19 outbreak, but cases appear to have slowed in recent days.

- 00:00 GMT: UK coronavirus vaccine triggers immune response in trials [video available at the source URL above; see also https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31604-4/fulltext]

[These countries had been selected based on having had significant surges of SARS-CoV-2 infections but different responses. In some cases, transmission was almost interrupted, but resurgences have occurred, and countries have handled them differently. One observation is that lifting of restrictions has led to major resurgences in some areas; in others, early new threats seem to be importations, but community spread does recur. Good contact tracing has helped to shorten the time with new clusters, and temporary new restrictions have had an impact. Countries not implementing restrictions have done more poorly, with major resurgences and more widespread community-based transmission.

In South Korea, it looks like major transmission is beginning. Previously, when there were major events, time-limited increased restrictions were implemented. A key takeaway message is that the virus is still circulating globally, and relaxing of the guard (eliminating simple measures of social distancing, face masks, hand washing, and large gatherings) is an open invitation for the virus to re-enter with clusters of cases and ultimately community transmission. - Mods.MPP/UBA]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215. Data by country, area, or territory can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesAug19_1597915357.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 49.5% of daily case numbers and 49.9% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours. maintaining its dominance as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 11.7 million cases. The USA and Brazil continue to dominate followed by Colombia, Peru, Argentina, and Mexico.

- The European region reported 11.8% of daily case numbers and 7.5% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours and total cumulative cases reported greater than 3.8 million. Russia continues its dominance followed by Ukraine, Turkey, Israel, Sweden, Romania, and the UK.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 6.6% of daily case numbers and 8.1% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of greater than 1.7 million cases. Iraq continues to dominate, followed by Iran, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Kuwait, and Pakistan.

- The African region reported 2.9% of daily case numbers and 7.5% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.96 million cases. South Africa continues to dominate followed by Ethiopia, Gambia, Kenya, Algeria, and Nigeria.

- The Western Pacific region reported 3.0% of daily case numbers and 0.84% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.4 million cases. The Philippines continues to dominate followed by Japan, Australia, and South Korea. Viet Nam and New Zealand continue to report newly confirmed cases following the new outbreaks identified in the past few weeks.

- The South East Asia region reported 33.1% of the daily newly reported cases and 26.2% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 3.2 million cases. India continues to be the driving force of the dominance of this region followed by Bangladesh and Indonesia.

Impression: The overall picture is basically the same. The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed on a daily basis followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, followed by the Africa region, and the Western Pacific region representing the lowest daily caseload of all the regions. While regional proportions may not reflect this, most of the regions have countries with resurgences associated with lifting of restrictions.

On the overview tab at the WHO source URL, the epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases by WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 19 Aug 2020, is the same epidemic curve included in the previous situation updates and is an excellent visual representation of the epidemic as described in the text above. - Mod.UBA]

[The USA, Brazil, and India are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations. In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (69 196), followed by Brazil (48 541), and the USA (44 957) -- account for over half of all confirmed cases globally (53.1%). There were 6676 deaths reported in the past 24 hours (18 Aug 2020).

In descending rank order, India is number one for the number of newly confirmed in the past 24 hours, followed by Brazil, USA, Colombia, Peru, Argentina, Mexico, Russia, Philippines, and Iraq. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed goes from 4093 to 69 196. Other hotspots are seen in the countries numbered 11-20 in this list: South Africa, France, Spain, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Iran, Ukraine, Indonesia, Israel, Ecuador, and Morocco; their range of reported new cases is 1510 to 3910. A total of 31 countries have reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is virtually no change in average number of daily reported cases (a decrease of 1.3%), and looking at daily reported deaths, the change is decreased by 6.6%. The key question remains as to whether transmission is in fact slowing down or whether these figures reflect reporting artifact seen surrounding weekends. Time will tell, but following the data reports showing major surges in countries that had been showing successes makes one wonder what is driving these reporting variances (We haven't changed our minds! -- We feel like a broken record here...).

Impression: The SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts and mortality, while the global 7-day averages seem to reflect a slowing down of reporting confirmed cases; however, I still wonder whether this is real or reflects a changing pattern with decreased testing or case reporting. For example, the USA reported data suggest a slowing down of transmission over the past 2 weeks as seen by the comparative 7-day averages in reported new cases (see section [3E] above), but if one looks at the percentage of positive PCR tests, in the past 2 weeks the positivity rate has been stable at 9%, consistent with significant ongoing transmission that is not abating (see https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html). The most severely affected region is the Americas, with increasing daily case counts, even though the comparative 7-day average suggests things may be slowing down (or reporting is slowing down). India also drives the next most affected region -- South East Asia -- with persistent high daily case reports. - Mods.UBA/MPP]
