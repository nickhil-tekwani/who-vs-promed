See also: 27 Aug 2004, 13 Aug 2004
Translation of information received on 30 Aug 2004 from Dr Juan Alcides
Santaella Guttierez, General Manager, Colombian Institute for Agriculture
and Livestock (ICA), Bogota:
End of previous report period: 18 Aug 2004 (see Disease Information, 17
[35], 241, dated 27 Aug 2004).
End of this report period: 27 Aug 2004.
A new outbreak has been reported, 0.5 km from the primary outbreak.
Description of affected population in the new outbreak: pigs.
Total number of animals in the 1st outbreak (corrected data):
species: bov
susceptible: 484
cases: 107
deaths: 0
destroyed: 107
slaughtered: 0
Total number of animals in the 2nd outbreak:
species: sui
susceptible: 2
cases: 2
deaths: 0
destroyed: 2
slaughtered: 0
Diagnosis: the owner of the 2 sick pigs notified the ICA. In view of the
clinical signs, the proximity of the primary outbreak and the results of
laboratory tests, the only 2 pigs in the affected farm were slaughtered and
destroyed.
A. Laboratory where diagnosis was made: National Laboratory of Veterinary
Diagnostics ICA-CEISA, Bogota.
B. Diagnostic tests used: complement fixation test (20 Aug 2004).
C. Causal agent: FMD virus type A.
Mode of spread: probably through the movement of persons (given the
proximity of the primary outbreak).
Control measures during reporting period:
The perifocal zone has been extended; the records show that, to date, 5006
cattle out of the 5240 cattle present have been vaccinated.
In addition, the following measures are being maintained:
- movement restrictions, with the presence of control posts;
- epidemiological surveillance;
- quarantine in 6 municipalities close to the outbreaks (CÃºcuta, El Tarra,
Puerto Santander, Sardinata, Tibu and Zulia);
- stamping out, with destruction of carcasses by burial.

[The movement of the virus into another species, pigs, will only complicate
the efforts to clean up the outbreak. It would be a good idea to intensify
surveillance of swine in the region, in addition to continuing efforts in
cattle. - Mod.PC]
