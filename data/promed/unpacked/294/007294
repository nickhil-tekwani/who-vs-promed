A 37-year-old man from Alba is suspected of having anthrax and was admitted for observation and treatment. His life is out of danger. The diagnosis will be confirmed or denied by more detailed laboratory analyses. The first analysis performed indicated the presence of the _Bacillus anthracis_ that causes the anthrax disease.

The Department of Epidemiology within DSP Alba, in collaboration with DSVSA Alba, is conducting an investigation on this case, and the first data indicates the disease might have been contracted from the animals (sheep) that the man raises in his household. The man presented himself at a hospital in the county for thorough investigations by indication of the family doctor who noticed an old wound, with unfavorable evolution on the patient's left-hand pinky finger. The last case of anthrax was registered in Alba County approximately 7 years ago.

Anthrax is an infectious disease caused by _Bacillus anthracis_. The disease is a zoonosis (a disease common to humans and animals) and is more frequent in cattle, goats, and sheep. Anthrax can be fatal if not detected and treated in time.

[Alba is in central Romania. in one-time Transylvania; see Wikipedia with map: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alba_County

That the infected person presented himself at the local hospital indicates that he had a cutaneous infection. His doctor describes it as an "old" hand wound which suggests that it had blackened as is usual with anthrax cutaneous wounds. Logically this young man had skinned and butchered a sick sheep in his flock.

The last known case of anthrax in Alba county was some seven years ago. It is missing from our list of Romanian anthrax reports. This disease is sporadic in Romania, seldom seen and reported, which would decrease its recognition when livestock outbreaks occur. Human cutaneous cases are simple to recognise -- a local inflamed lesion that itches and is painless -- which is why some outbreak reports are preceded by a human case at a local clinic, and the livestock cases found during the veterinary investigation. We look forward to the findings of the public health and animal health investigations. - Mod.MHJ
