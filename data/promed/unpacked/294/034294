[3] USA: monkeypox in the immunocompromised
Date: Wed 26 Oct 2022
Source: CDC. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2022 (early release) [edited]
https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7144e1.htm#suggestedcitation


Citation. Miller MJ, Cash-Goldwasser S, Marx GE, et al. Severe monkeypox in hospitalized patients -- United States, August 10 - October 10, 2022. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2022
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
What is already known about this topic?
Severe manifestations of monkeypox in immunocompromised persons have been observed in previous outbreaks.

What is added by this report?
During August-October 2022, CDC provided clinical consultation for 57 hospitalized patients with severe manifestations of monkeypox, most of whom were Black men with AIDS. Delays were observed in initiation of monkeypox-directed therapies. Of these cases, 12 patients died, and monkeypox was a cause of death or contributing factor in five patients to date, with several other deaths still under investigation.

What are the implications for public health practice?
Clinicians should consider early treatment with available therapeutics for those at risk for severe monkeypox disease, particularly patients with AIDS. Engaging all persons with HIV in care remains a critical public health priority.

Discussion [abridged]
The occurrence of severe manifestations of monkeypox in patients who were most commonly immunocompromised because of AIDS highlights the importance of engaging all persons with HIV in sustained care and ending the HIV epidemic. Clinicians should consider close clinical monitoring, early treatment with available medical countermeasures, and extension or escalation of therapy as indicated in patients with or at risk for severe monkeypox. Ensuring equitable access to resources for the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of HIV and monkeypox remains a vital public health priority.

[4] USA: interventions to deal with monkeypox

Citation. Landers S, Kapadia F, Tarantola D. Monkeypox, after HIV/AIDS and COVID-19: Suggestions for collective action and a public health of consequence, November 2022. Am J Public Health. 2022; 112(11):1564-1566
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As noted by Holloway (p. 1572), to avert the mistakes in the response to the HIV and COVID-19 pandemics, the public health responses to MPX can build on policies and programs that worked as well as those that did not in the effort to mitigate the spread and impact of HIV and COVID-19. Thus, we posit the following 3 suggestions for collective action in support of people affected by MPX as well as those still vulnerable to infection and its wide-ranging sequalae. These investments should support multilevel interventions that address homophobia, racism, increasing resilience, and empowering community coalitions.(6)

First, we need a rapid assessment and mapping of behavioral, social, and structural factors driving MPX vulnerability by partnering with community-based organizations and other social service providers. Information from the community level up provides a more appropriate and complete picture of multilevel factors impacting MPX transmission dynamics. The availability (or lack thereof) of community-level resources can be leveraged to support and effectively disseminate MPX prevention and intervention services.

Second, involvement of communities of MPX-affected as well as vulnerable people in the design, implementation, monitoring, and accountability concerning case finding, contact tracing, and prevention is necessary. This includes the design and deployment of primary risk reduction programs to increase equitable access to vaccines and other technologies, all informed by evidence and combined with antidiscrimination policies, laws, and actions.(7) The practice pieces by Davis et al. (p. 1560), and Gupta et al. (p. 1566) provide strong support for collaborating with local health departments and community-based organizations to reduce barriers and improve access to COVID-19 testing and vaccination that can serve as exemplars for MPX testing and vaccination efforts.

Third, community leadership should be supported in designing educational messaging on MPX specifically adapted to their communities. For the broader public, messaging should avoid further stigmatizing gay, bisexual, and other MSM. For gay, bisexual, and other MSM, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has developed a 2-page fact sheet titled "Monkeypox and Safer Sex" or "La Viruela Simica o del Mono y las Relationones Sexuales Mas Seguras" that can be adapted to be culturally relevant for the community in which it is being used.(8) Importantly, many of the recommendations for addressing HIV and COVID-19 have been about meeting communities where they are and listening to their voices. The following message from the National Black Gay Men's Coalition (NBGMAC) exemplifies the inclusivity, honesty, and clarity in messaging that we can achieve by partnering with community advocates.
