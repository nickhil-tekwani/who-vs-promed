Anthrax outbreaks announced in Chinese provinces
------------------------------------------------
Villagers from Ganmazhen in Lianyungang, Jiangsu Province have contracted anthrax from an infected cow. The village was closed off and victims were isolated in a nearby hospital. Locals are now scared to eat beef out of fear of contracting the disease. Several dozen people in 2 different Chinese provinces are being treated for anthrax, an often fatal disease contracted from infected animals. A village in eastern China is under quarantine.

Around 10 people have been diagnosed with anthrax and were isolated according to residents of Ganmazhen Village near the coastal city of Lianyungang in China's eastern Jiangsu Province. A villager told The Epoch Times that the majority of those infected are women. He said that sick cows were believed to have been the source of the outbreak and described the symptoms as "red pimples all over their bodies," which turn into blisters and then turn black. Villagers heard about the outbreak only a week ago, and it was later confirmed that it was anthrax.

Another Ganmazhen resident told The Epoch Times that the village was closed off and victims were isolated in a nearby hospital. Locals are now scared to eat beef out of fear of contracting the disease.

A microblog on China's QQ generated over 40 000 responses, most of them from citizens in Shanghai, which borders Jiangsu Province where the outbreak occurred. People cautioned each other not to eat out and to avoid beef.

A report by Beijing News, republished by Sina Web portal in late July [2012], said that Ganmazhen villagers killed a sick cow that was transported there from another province. 7 out of 10 people began to have skin blisters and other symptoms. But at the time, only 2 were diagnosed with anthrax and had symptoms including blisters and blackened skin. 5 were isolated at Lianyungang Number 4 Hospital. All 10 villagers' homes were "disinfected," the report said.

Another anthrax outbreak occurred in the Xiuyan and Haicheng regions of northeastern Liaoning Province, according to the official provincial website. As of 10 Aug 2012, 21 cases have been reported, with 3 confirmed and 18 suspected. All 21 patients have been isolated at the Anshan Hospital for Infectious Diseases. The epidemic had spread through contact with bacteria during the slaughtering of sick cows, the provincial website said.

[This adds some community response colour to the previous report. There is now a public awareness of the risk, which hopefully will translate into a reluctance to slaughter and butcher sick cows. - Mod.MHJ
