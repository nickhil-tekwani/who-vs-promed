- The Forum on Immunization and Polio Eradication in Africa was held this past weekend in Dakar, Senegal, hosted by H.E. President Macky Sall, President of Senegal and Chair of the African Union (AU), who was joined by Umaro Embalo, President of Guinea-Bissau and Chair of ECOWAS. The event was co-hosted by the Government of Senegal, Africa CDC, World Health Organization, UNICEF, Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance, Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), CEPI, Institut Pasteur de Dakar, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, USAID, UKAID, Rotary International, Speak Up Africa, and Enda Sante. The goal of the Forum was to re-mobilize Heads of State on the Addis Declaration on Immunization (ADI), to build momentum for immunization and polio eradication, and to encourage support among policymakers across the continent for scaled-up policies and financing to address the alarming declines in immunization rates and the resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases. President Sall issued a call to action in his speech, asking other Heads of State to renew their commitment to immunization. This is the start of an intensive effort for 2023, which will be a critical year for immunization and polio eradication; upcoming milestones include the release of UNICEF's State of the World's Children report, Gavi mid-term review and other activities still in development by WHO and other stakeholders. You can see a recording of the event at https://www.remobilizeadi.org/factsheet.

- At its 9th annual meeting, the Islamic Advisory Group (IAG) reiterated its commitment to addressing current and emerging public health challenges in the Eastern Mediterranean Region and beyond and using religion to dispel misconceptions around public health.

- The WHO Executive Board report on polio transition planning and polio post-certification provides an update on the implementation of the Strategic Action Plan on Polio Transition (2018-2023), with a focus on steps being taken by the Secretariat in 2023 to respond to the recommendations of the mid-term evaluation of the Strategic Action Plan, and on progress at the country level. The coming year [2023], during which a new global vision and regional action plans for transition will be developed, will be critical to ensure that polio transition and integration efforts are sustainable and fully aligned with national and regional health priorities, especially related to essential immunization, disease surveillance, emergency preparedness and response and protecting countries against poliovirus importation.

- At last week's Gavi Board meeting in Geneva, the Board extended the Gavi eligibility and co-financing exemptions for inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in support of polio eradication efforts, and confirmed zero co-financing requirements for outbreak response and refugee populations currently not integrated into national plans.

- Polio experts eye clear tactics to achieve success; as 2022 draws to a close, independent technical bodies from key epi-centres dive deep on what it will take to achieve success in 2023.

[This past week has seen confirmation of wild poliovirus (WPV1) in environmental samples and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) continues to be identified. Note that while Pakistan hasn't reported any AFP cases associated with WPV1 infection in the past few weeks, the positive ESs confirm that the virus is still circulating in the country and the same can be said for Afghanistan. In the past week cVDPV2 cases have been confirmed in DR Congo and positive ES samples identified in Botswana. Hence there are 4 countries reporting identification of a poliovirus circulating in their country.

A map showing the locations of each confirmed case of polio worldwide in the past 12 months can be found at https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/. One can see cases of cVDPV in a band across Africa and in Israel, Ukraine, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan; cVDPV1 in DR Congo, Madagascar, Mozambique and Yemen; and WPV1 in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Malawi, and Mozambique. - Mod.MPP]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Background
Vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) is a potential threat to polio eradication because they can be reintroduced into the general population and cause paralytic polio outbreaks, a phenomenon that has recently emerged as a prominent public health concern at the end of global polio eradication. This study aimed to describe the epidemiology and genetic characteristics of the 1st VDPV identified from a patient with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), with 4 doses of inactivated polio vaccine immunization in Henan Province, China in 2017.

Methods
The patient was diagnosed with type 3 VDPV. Subsequently, a series of epidemiological approaches was implemented, including a retrospective search of AFP cases, rate of vaccination assessment, study of contacts, and supplementary immunization activities. Fecal samples were collected, viral isolation was performed, and the viral isolates were characterized using full-length genomic sequencing and bioinformatic analysis.

Results
Phylogenetic analysis showed that the viral isolates from the patient were different from other reported genetic clusters of type 3 VDPV worldwide. They were identified as a Sabin 3/Sabin 1 recombinant VDPV with a crossover site in the P2 region. Nucleotide substitutions, including U - C (472) and C - U (2493), have been identified, both of which are frequently observed as reversion mutations in neurovirulent type 3 poliovirus. A unique aspect of this case is that the patient had been vaccinated with 4 doses of inactive polio vaccine, and the serum neutralizing antibody for Sabin types 1 and 3 were 1:16 and 1:512, respectively. Thus, the patient was speculated to have been infected with type 3 VDPV, and the virus continued to replicate and be excreted for at least 41 d.

Conclusions
The existence of this kind of virus in human population is a serious risk and poses a severe challenge to maintaining a polio-free status in China. To the best of our knowledge, this is the 1st report of VDPV identified in the Henan province of China. Our results highlight the importance of maintaining a high-level vaccination rate and highly sensitive AFP case surveillance system in intercepting VDPV transmission.

[The recommended vaccination schedule for polio prevention in China includes -- a 4-dose series -- inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) given at 2 months and 3 months of age followed by bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV) given at 4 months and 4 years of age (a 4-dose IPV-IPV-bOPV-bOPV schedule) (https://weekly.chinacdc.cn/fileCCDCW/journal/article/ccdcw/2021/52/PDF/210299.pdf). Families can opt for pure IPV schedule.

I came upon this publication yesterday (14 Dec 2022) and found it interesting. The child was fully immunized with 4 doses of IPV but was infected with a VDPV3, resulting in a transient paralysis that apparently resolved. Sobering is the observation that vaccination coverages are down (pre COVID-19) in China. And this case serves as a reminder that lowered coverages are a conduit for circulation of both the WPV and VDPVs if importations occur.
