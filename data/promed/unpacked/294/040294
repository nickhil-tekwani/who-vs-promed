In the last several decades, frogs and toads around the world have died off
in large numbers, leading to theories that climate change is the cause. But
there is no significant correlation between the amphibians' croaking and
climate variations, say 2 Boulder scientists who have studied the die-offs
in Colorado, Costa Rica/Panama and Australia. Those 3 areas have had
well-documented amphibian die-offs due to disease. Cynthia Carey, a
professor at the University of Colorado at Boulder, said she isn't ready to
give up studying whether the disease outbreak may be indirectly influenced
by climate and environmental factors.
"We don't know anything about what sorts of environmental factors could tip
the balance between pathogens and amphibian immune defenses," Carey said.
The global amphibian decline could have many causes, such as loss of
forests and wetlands, pesticide use and the introduction of a predator, she
said. But she's concerned many amphibians live in relatively undisturbed areas.
"We need to move on this problem quickly," Carey said. "There is not much
time left to identify and fix the problem before Earth loses most of its
amphibians."
Results of the study by Carey and climatologist Michael Alexander of the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration were presented at a
national conference in Washington, D.C. The American Association for the
Advancement of Science sessions that run through Tuesday are attracting
more than 600 speakers from around the world.
Carey and Alexander looked at climate information from Colorado's
mountains, and the tropical locales in Queensland, Australia, Costa Rica
and Panama. They gathered information from land, sea and space sources to
see if there were unusual temperature or precipitation patterns that
coincided with amphibian dieoffs from the 1970s to the 1990s. But Carey
said they came up empty-handed on an apparent correlation between weather
and outbreaks of amphibian disease.
In 1998, scientists noted that amphibians around the world were dying from
skin infections caused by a fungus. Two of the 3 largest populations of
endangered boreal toads in Colorado - in Rocky Mountain National Park and
Clear Creek County - are now infected with the fungus, said Carey, one of
the first US scientists to tie amphibian die-offs to disease. In Colorado,
boreal toad and leopard frog die-offs, probably caused by fungal
infections, began in 1973 and continued until about 1982.
Carey said the Colorado die-offs resumed in 1997, but don't seem as
virulent this time around.
