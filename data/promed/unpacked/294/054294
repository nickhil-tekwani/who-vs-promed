South Korean doctors on alert for super bacteria
-----------------------
South Korea's medical world has been put on alert after researchers spoke
of super bacteria resistant to the toughest antibiotics spreading in Asia.
There is no effective weapon against the deadly bacteria, because their
unique enzyme breaks down antibiotic substances, according to a Yonsei
University Hospital research team. Team leader Lee Gyung-Won said the
bacteria were among the most worrying problems for doctors as they spread
quickly through hospitals.
His team tested body waste samples from 7275 patients from 28 hospitals and
found 82 people infected with the bacteria with a new type of enzyme called
VIM-2. The bacteria with VIM2 enzymes was first reported in France in 2000.
It is the first time the super bacteria have been discovered in Asia [see
below -Mod.LL].
"The super bacteria [were] the result of excessive use of antibiotics," Mr
Lee said. The bacteria are resistant to carbapenems, [one of] the most
powerful antibiotics, he said.

[The VIM group of metallo-beta-lactamases are very broad-spectrum in
activity, able to hydrolyze the extended spectrum penicillins and
cephalosporins and, most importantly, the carbapenems, imipenem and
meropenem. Only the monobactam, aztreonam, appears to retain substantial
antibacterial activity in the presence of these enzymes. VIM-2 was
characterized from _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ in France in 2000 (1) and
described in Italy as well (2). Although the above piece states that VIM-2
has not been described in Asia, a report found VIM-2 and VIM-3 in isolates
of Pseudomonas species, primarily in _P. aeruginosa_, in Taiwan (3).
