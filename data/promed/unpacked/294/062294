A new disease in mango crops
----------------------------
The malformation disease of mango crops has a large presence in the
Axarquia [region, east of Malaga]. It is a new disease that has spread
wherever there is mango cultivation. Malformation is an extremely
serious problem that is causing economic losses, as it can affect both
floral structures and vegetative parts.

A study will be conducted including a survey in different growing
areas of the province to detect the disease and establish a map of
possible outbreaks.

[2] _Verticillium dahliae_: 1st report
Date: March 2010

[Ref: L Baeza-Montanez et al: First Report of verticillium wilt caused
by _Verticillium dahliae_ on mango trees (_Mangifera indica_) in
Southern Spain. Plant Dis 2010; 94(3): 380; DOI:
10.1094/PDIS-94-3-0380C]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Verticillium wilt, primarily caused by _Verticillium dahliae_ and _V.
albo-atrum_, affects a wide range of economically important crops.
This disease is an increasing problem in areas where young mango trees
are planted on land previously planted in vegetable crops. In 2008,
symptoms of verticillium wilt were observed in mango in the
subtropical fruit-producing area of Malaga in southern Spain. In a new
mango grove, previously planted with potatoes and tomatoes, around 20
percent of 200 1-year-old trees had one-sided branch dieback. In many
of these trees the symptoms expanded, leading to decline and eventual
death. Cross sections of affected branches revealed brown vascular
discoloration.

_Verticillium_ was isolated from symptomatic branches, and also from
symptomatic potato plants grown in a nearby field. Identification of
_V. dahliae_ was initially based on morphology and further confirmed
by molecular methods. PCR fragments were sequenced and identical to
the _V. dahliae_ reference sequence in GenBank database. Pathogenicity
assays were conducted with a selected isolate from mango using tomato
plants. Symptoms were scored at various time points, and the mango
isolate was found to cause typical verticillium wilt symptoms. _V.
dahliae_ was reisolated from symptomatic tomato plants but not from
non-inoculated controls.

To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of verticillium wilt on mango
in Spain. More problems with verticillium wilt are expected because of
the increasing planting of mango in fields previously dedicated to
horticultural crops.

[Malformation disease
---------------------
Mango malformation disease (MMD) is a fungal disease caused by several
species of _Fusarium_, some yet to be described. Mango is the only
known host, and it is one of the most important diseases of this crop.
The disease was first reported in India, but has subsequently been
found in many other regions. However, fungal species contributing to
MMD may possibly vary in different areas.

Infected shoots are misshapen with shortened internodes and small
stubby leaves. Inflorescences are shorter, thicker, have crowded
branches, and do not bear fruit. Shoot malformation is most severe on
seedlings but can also seriously affect mature trees. Symptoms are
thought to be a result of hormonal imbalances induced by the fungi.

The epidemiology of MMD is poorly understood. It spreads very slowly,
but if left unchecked, it can severely reduce yields. The main method
of spread to new areas is through infected vegetative planting
material; there is no evidence of spread with fruits or seeds. MMD is
often associated with the bud mite _Aceria mangiferae_, but the mites
have been shown to spread the disease only within a tree, not between
trees. Disease management relies mainly on phytosanitary measures,
removal/exclusion of inoculum, and the use of clean planting material.

Verticillium wilt
-----------------
Serious wilting diseases caused by _Verticillium dahliae_ and _V.
albo-atrum_ affect a wide range of plants including, for example, many
vegetable crops, oilseed rape, olive, and mango. Symptoms may include
wilting and yellowing of leaves, leaf lesions, branch dieback,
stunting, as well as brown streaks in vascular tissues. Symptoms may
only become apparent under dry conditions or other stress factors.

The fungi are soil-borne and can persist in soils for many years. When
crops are planted in infested soil, the fungi invade through roots.
The disease can be spread with soil, plant parts, and by mechanical
means, and weeds may act as pathogen reservoirs. Airborne spread is
also suspected. Disease management is difficult and may include crop
rotation and soil treatments to reduce soil-borne inoculum. Resistant
cultivars are being developed for some crops. For tree crops, the most
practical means of control is considered to avoid land with a previous
history of host crops.

In southern Spain, olive orchards are often severely affected by
verticillium wilt and may provide a source of inoculum for the mango
crops, in addition to the vegetable crops mentioned above. Recently,
pistachio trees in the Castile-La Mancha and Andalusia regions grown
close to wilt affected olive orchards have also been shown to be
affected by _V. dahliae_ (see link below).
