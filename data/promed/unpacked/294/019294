7 Saskatchewan bison die from anthrax
-------------------------------------
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) said Friday [25 Jul 2008],
7 bison on one farm in the northern Saskatchewan municipality of
Paddockwood, near Prince Albert, were confirmed Thursday [24 Jul
2008] to have died of anthrax. The dead animals make up the 2nd
separate case of anthrax poisoning [sic] in the province this week,
the CFIA said, noting one death in a cattle herd in the RM [rural
municipality] of Ponass Lake, confirmed Tuesday [22 Jul 2008]. The RM
is about 100 km (62 mi) east of Humboldt.

A farm in the RM of King George, southeast of Rosetown, was confirmed
[26 May 2008] as having the province's 1st cases of anthrax this
spring [2008] after 13 cattle died on one local farm.

Findings of anthrax in Western Canada are common, CFIA said, and the
spores that cause the disease are known to exist in soil across the
Prairies.

All suspected or confirmed cases of anthrax must be reported to the
CFIA, which recommends that as a precaution, producers should
immediately notify their veterinarians of any sudden deaths in their
herds. When anthrax is confirmed, the CFIA quarantines affected
premises during decontamination and disposal. Producers of livestock
affected by anthrax may get compensation of between CAD 100 (USD 98)
and CAD 500 (USD 490) per animal, depending on species, once CFIA
confirms disease control actions are complete.

In 2007, anthrax was reported on 23 farms in Manitoba, 6 in
Saskatchewan, and 4 in Alberta.

Saskatchewan 2nd case of anthrax this week found on Prince Albert farm
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A farm north of Prince Albert is the site of Saskatchewan's 2nd case
of anthrax this week [21-27 Jul 2008]. The Canadian Food Inspection
Agency says 7 bison have tested positive for the bacteria. The food
inspection agency is at the bison ranch to implement standard disease
control measures, including quarantine.

A cow near Saskatoon tested positive earlier this week, and 13 cattle
in the Swift Current area were discovered with the disease in May
[2008].

In 2006, an anthrax outbreak in the province killed over 800 animals.

[Our thanks to Joe and Brent for catching these separate reports.

Considering the extensive epidemic in Saskatchewan in 2006 and
resulting soil contamination, however careful the cleanup, these 3
outbreaks are not unexpected. As you will see from their locations
below, these 3 outbreaks are well spread out in the province. Whether
we will see a rerun of 2006 depends on how carefully the ranchers
have been listening to vaccination advice.

While the Canadian policy of compensation increases reporting markedly
-- virtually nothing was reported in the decades prior to the setting
up of this Canadian scheme in the mid '60s -- latterly it has been
noted that some ranchers have only vaccinated their affected stock
after outbreaks have been occurred. There is a move to make
compensation payable _only_ when the affected rancher had vaccinated
his stock before the summer anthrax season. This makes a lot of sense.
Also it is only a matter of time until Canadian lawyers cotton on to
the fact that when diagnosis is delayed for whatever good or bad
reason, and the index ranch has some 4-6 moribund or dead cows from
anthrax, the possibility of neighbouring herds coming down with
anthrax because of foraging female mouthpart-contaminated haemophagic
flies (that is, blood-sucking horseflies) is significantly increased,
that is, as a result of a reporting failure by the index rancher. Thus
an added benefit of vaccination is as lawyer insurance ... no small
benefit in North America.
