The sub-adult lioness that attacked 5 people in Amreli [Gujarat state] last Saturday [1 Nov 2014] died during treatment at Sasan rescue centre. The lioness died of suspected rabies.

It is a long time since a lion death by rabies has been reported. On Saturday, this lioness of about 2 years had attacked 5 people in Kachivada area of Amreli. The lioness was believed to have strayed away from its group and entered the village.

On Saturday morning there was scare in the village as the lioness was seen running in the streets attacking all those who came in its way. Officials said that after being rescued from the village, the lioness was brought to Dhari Centre; its behavior was found to be unusual and hence it was shifted to the Jasadhar and subsequently to Sasan centre where it died of suspected rabies.

However, chief conservator of forest R Meena said the doctors who treated the lioness or had carried out the post mortem could not ascertain the cause of death and hence a detailed investigation has been ordered.

Former additional chief conservator of forest and member of National Board of Wildlife H S Singh said that it could have eaten a rabid dog as a result of which it might have got rabies. Usually such incidents are rare and occur once in a while, he said.

[Lions invading villages in search of an easy meal is a universal problem. In Africa, once rindepest was eradicated, the lions hunted dogs and thus have acquired clinical canine distemper; previously, feeding on sick wildebeest had provided them with immunity, but once that routine exposure ceased, so did their immunity. Obviously, if this supposition of source is correct, an effective canine rabies control programme would provide one less reason for lions coming a-calling in villages. It is interesting that this newspaper account just says that 5 people were attacked, period. More space is given to the "rescue" of this sick and disturbed young lioness.
