Avian influenza situation - Indonesia
-------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health of Indonesia has announced a new case of human
infection of H5N1 avian influenza. A 25-year-old female from South
Jakarta District, DKI Jakarta Province died on 25 Jan 2010.
Laboratory tests were positive for H5N1 virus infection. The patient
was possibly infected from direct contact with poultry.

Of the 163 cases confirmed to date in Indonesia, 135 have been fatal.

[This case is presumed to be the 29-year-old patient in Pasar Rebo
hospital, South Jakarta, suspected to be the 1st human case of avian
influenza (H5N1) virus infection in Indonesia in 2010 (see
ProMED-mail post Avian influenza, human (08): Indonesia (S. Jakarta),
susp. 20100131.03360. This case becomes also the first fatality in
Indonesia in 2010.

Viki Hansen-Landis has pointed out that the WHO Table of the
Cumulative Number of Confirmed Human Cases of Avian Influenza
A/(H5N1) Reported to WHO released on 12 Feb 2010 gives the 2009 tally
of avian influenza (H5N1) cases in Indonesia as 21 with 19 fatalites
(<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2010_02_12/en/index.html>),
whereas in the previous release (30 Jan 2010) the number of cases was
given as 20 with 19 fatalities. ProMED-mail would welcome information
resolving this discrepancy.
