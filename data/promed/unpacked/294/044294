Three confirmed cases and one suspected case of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Montevideo linked to Denny's Restaurant in Rochester are being investigated by Olmsted County Public Health Services and the Minnesota Department of Health, according to a news release. As of Fri 13 Jul 2012, they had not found a specific food source, said Shaylene Baumbach, a public health educator for Olmsted County. They are investigating the possibility that a Denny's Restaurant patron or employee brought in the foodborne illness.

The confirmed cases all dined at Denny's Restaurant between 27 Jun 2012 and 5 Jul 2012 and were hospitalized for salmonellosis, which began between 2:00 and 7:00 PM.

However, Baumbach said, it is still safe to eat at Denny's Restaurant. Baumbach said the restaurant has cooperated fully with the investigation. The county and state health departments have discarded potentially contaminated foods, cleaned and sanitized food surfaces, implemented strict glove use, and excluded ill or recently ill employees, according to the release.

"We did not close down Denny's specifically because we were able to get into the restaurant early enough to start the intervention right away," she said. Baumbach said the number of cases and other details will change as more information is gathered.
