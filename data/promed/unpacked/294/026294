The following background data on Kawasaki disease in Japan and the United
States have been extracted from the GIDEON database.
Japan:
140 837 cases were reported during 1970 to 1996. "Epidemics" were described
in 1979, in 1982 (estimated 15 000 cases), and in 1985 to 1986 (over 12 500
cases). A total of 1598 cases were reported in 1991, 1524 in 1992, 5389 in
1993, 6069 in 1994, 1841 in 1995, and 1749 in 1996. The male/female ratio
among reported cases is 1.38/1 to 1.42/1. The case fatality rate was 1 per
cent in 1974 and 0.04 per cent in 1992. In total 9 fatal cases were
reported during 1993 to 1994.
United States:
The annual incidence of Kawasaki disease among children under 5 years of
age is 1.1/100 000, with peak incidence in the age group 13 to 24 months.
Four fifths of cases reported are under 5 years of age. 2126 cases were
reported during 1976 to 1985. 85 cases were reported among American Indian
and Alaskan native children during 1980 to 1985. 8000 reports were elicited
through an active case registry for 1984 through 1990 -- the true number
was estimated to be 13 720. Sporadic "epidemics" of up to 150/100 000
population have occurred -- Hawaii (1978), Rochester NY (1979 to 1980),
Maryland (1983), multiple areas (1984 to 1985).

still unknown, it cannot yet be called an (infectious) disease entity but
should still regarded as a clinical entity. - Mod.CP
