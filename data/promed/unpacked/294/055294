Confirmed case of bat rabies in Lancashire
------------------------------------------
Further tests carried out on the Daubenton's bat submitted to the
Veterinary Laboratories Agency in Weybridge, Surrey have confirmed the
presence of a strain of "bat rabies," European Bat Lyssavirus 2 (EBL 2).
Presence of EBL 2 in a bat may indicate that the disease is present at a
very low level in United Kingdom bats. DEFRA is continuing to investigate
this case and will undertake further surveillance to try and establish
presence of EBL 2 and its related virus EBL 1. Confirmation of the disease
in a non-terrestrial mammal does not mean that the United Kingdom loses its
rabies-free status.
EBLs may be transmitted by a bite, but transmissions to terrestrial mammals
are rare. Nevertheless, common-sense precautions are advisable. People who
find a sick or ailing bat should not approach or handle the bat but seek
advice from a local bat conservation group.
Licensed bat handlers and anyone who regularly handles bats in the United
Kingdom should ensure that they have been vaccinated against rabies and
should always wear protective gloves when handling bats. If any person is
bitten by a bat, the wound should be cleaned immediately and thoroughly
with soap and water. Additional cleansing of the wound site with an alcohol
base or other disinfectant is also recommended, and immediate medical
advice must be sought, as with any animal bite.
DEFRA will discuss with the Bat Conservation Trust and other relevant
wildlife groups to ensure that this advice is passed on to bat conservation
workers involved in handling bats regularly.
