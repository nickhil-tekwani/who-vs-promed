The French Agriculture Ministry announced today a new case of mad cow
disease - the third case reported this month in France - has been detected
in the Pas de Calais region, near the English Channel.
It was the 15th case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy reported this year
in France and the 46th case since 1990, the Ministry said.
Following existing regulations, the entire herd of 180 cows was incinerated
over the weekend. The Ministry did not specify who owned the cows or when
the illness in the one cow, a milk cow born in September 1994, was detected.
