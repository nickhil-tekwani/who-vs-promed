CJD OR NVCJD DIAGNOSIS - USA
============================
[The following appeared on BSE-L. I recommend that you read it and ponder
the many implications. MHJ]

In the discussion regarding the incidence of CJD or vCJD in the elderly they
state:
>However you have raised an interesting point about vCJD which is that it is
my understanding that vCJD is only suspected if the victim is unusually
young so it is likely that elderly victims of vCJD would never be tested.
Hence, no elderly victims have been found. Given their increased
susceptibility to regular CJD they may prove to be especially susceptible to
vCJD.<
"An interesting point, which I think has been made before. But some of the
physical symptoms of vCJD differ from other age-related diseases, don't
they? And the very widespread publicity which the disease has had here would
(one might think) excite doctors to be the first to find vCJD in an older
patient, to get their name in the medical journals if nothing else."
Based on my own, limited, one case, but very intimate experience with CJD in
the elderly, it seems that the medical community (at least in the US) is:
1) Woefully uninformed about CJD in general and vCJD in particular
2) Because of the "insurance" driven nature of the US health care system,
the medical community is reluctant to order testing that would eliminate
other diseases and/or define CJD (if they are even looking for it) in an
elderly patient that they suspect of "stroke" or "Alzheimer's."
3) All patients over the age of 65 fall under the US Medicare system. There
is a catch 22 in the Medicare system that will not allow a patient to be
admitted to a hospital for testing if there is no diagnosis that justifies
such testing. With CJD, without testing, there will be no diagnosis. The
initial presentation of CJD (in my mother's case diagnosed as "gait ataxia")
did not warrant hospitalization for testing.
4) Many elderly live either alone, or with an elderly spouse. Someone
suffering from later stage CJD declines so rapidly and has such diminished
mental capacity that they, themselves, are not able to relate the
circumstances of their disease to caregivers. An elderly spouse may be in no
better position to do so. Had we, the children, not been able to provide
historical information that made it abundantly clear that my mother had not
been suffering mental lapses for a long time, the medical community was
ready to diagnose either small strokes or Alzheimers and treat accordingly.
The general concensus was "After all, she's 76."
5) Medical support for the elderly is often provided through home caregivers
who visit on a regular basis (maybe only once or twice a week) and see the
patient for at most two hours. These may be nurses or occupational
therapists or just a home health aide. It may not be the same person every
time, if at all. If the patient does not have outside support from family or
independently hired help, their care and observation of symptoms may be left
largely to some 18 year old home health aide based on a two hour visit to
help with bathing or doing the laundry.
6) Once the clinical diagnosis of CJD is made (derived symptomatically), the
medical community is reluctant to perform a brain biopsy because of the
invasiveness of the procedure and its effects on the patient, but more
importantly because of the risk of infection to the medical practitioners.
In my mother's case, a spinal tap was done and CNS fluid sent to NIH for
testing under their new procedure. Before the results came back, the
hospital (Brigham and Womens in Boston - not some local community hospital
in Paduka) discharged her without performing a biopsy, although they had
initially been anxious to do one. Their desire to perform a biopsy
decreased in proportion to the symptoms becoming more positive for CJD.
7) The new spinal fluid test for CJD needs antemortem biopsy or post mortem
autopsy verification. My mother's spinal fluid tested positive for CJD. No
biopsy was performed.
8) The determination of CJD vs. nvCJD can only be made through antemortem
biopsy or post mortem autopsy. No biopsy was performed.
9) Upon my mother's death in a local nursing home NO ONE approached the
family to request an autopsy. The cause of death was known (CJD) and she was
76. The family requested an autopsy. The local hospital REFUSED to perform
an autopsy. The family insisted upon an autopsy and, at their own expense,
made special arrangements with Brigham and Women's Hospital to have one
performed. The family also searched out and made special arrangements to
have brain samples sent to Yale University for further testing, specifically
to determine CDJ vs. nvCJD. The autopsy was performed on the 20th of
February. Results are still pending.
There were specific reasons to suspect nvCJD vs. CJD:
1) Initial depression, which the family regarded as situational at the time.
2) First physical symptom was loss of balance and blurred vision leading to
gait ataxia.
3) EEG atypical for CJD only two weeks before death.
4) Course of disease from mild depression (June 1996) to death (Feb. 17, 1997).
5) Patient had travelled in England in the 1970's
6) Patient was a known eater of calves brains and sweetbreads whenever they
appeared on a restaurant menu.
Based on the foregoing, Charles statement that doctors would be on the
lookout for CJD vs. nvCJD, specifically in the elderly, can only be
characterized by me as laughable, at least in the United States. If ever
there was a case that seemed tailor made for such scrutiny, this was it.
Given the amount of family input required to even obtain the initial
diagnosis, and the fact that most elderly do not have that resource
available to them in close proximity, it is amazing to me that ANY CJD is
diagnosed in the elderly in the US. Also, given that a Yale retroactive
study of 46 Alzheimer's brains revealed that 6 (13%) of them were actually
CJD, I believe that it will take a lot more education and public health
intervention before CJD and nvCJD in the elderly is properly diagnosed and
reported.
Whether or not my mother's case was CJD or nvCJD is still not known. Based
on the symptoms and her history, I believe it was nvCJD. If we had left the
determination entirely in the hands of the medical community, we would never
know. More importantly, whatever scientific, medical and public health
issues would be affected by this would have been buried with her. And, I
believe, that is what is currently happening with most cases of CJD (whether
CJD or nvCJD) in the elderly, at least in the US.
