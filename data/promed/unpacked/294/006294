97/195 New diseases of fruit trees
Olive witches' broom disease
A new olive disorder has recently been reported in Central Italy. Diseased
plants showed dwarfed branches with shortened internodes, leaf deformation
and chlorosis, proliferation of axillary buds with witches' broom.
Phytoplasmas were detected in affected trees. Preliminary investigations
on the entomofauna revealed the presence of several potential vectors of
phytoplasmas, including some specimens of the genus _Hyalesthes_ (known to
be a vector of phytoplasmas). This disease has been observed in many olive
orchards in central Italy, and is causing severe economic problems.

XVII International Symposium on virus diseases of fruit trees, Bethesda,
