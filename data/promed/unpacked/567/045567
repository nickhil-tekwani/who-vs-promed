Person dies from hepatitis A complications after Famous Anthony's outbreak
----------------------------------------
A person who was hospitalized with hepatitis A complications after a recent outbreak has died, according to the Roanoke City and Alleghany Health Districts. Health officials said the patient had underlying medical conditions, and that no further information will be released in an effort to protect the patient's privacy and out of respect for their family. This death is the first reported in association with the recent hepatitis A outbreak.

"My heart goes out to the family and friends of this individual," said RCAHD health district director, Cynthia Morrow, MD, MPH. "Hepatitis A virus typically causes self-limited inflammation of the liver, however in this outbreak, we have seen a high rate of severe disease."

As of Friday [15 Oct 2021], health leaders said there are a total of 37 confirmed cases including 26 hospitalizations.

[Since the last post, the number of cases linked to an infected food handler has increased from 30 to 37 and there is now 1 death. The previous report noted only 3 hospitalizations but this report states that 26 were hospitalized and other media reports also give the higher number as well.

A 2020 CDC report [citation, text, and references follow] provided information to support not routinely immunizing food handlers against HAV. While focusing on high-risk groups for HAV is certainly more cost-effective, those groups are difficult to access for HAV immunization. Essentially any day, one can Google hepatitis A and find several reports of HAV infection in a food handler, and this cluster of now 30 and counting illustrates what can occur.

"The USA is experiencing person-to-person outbreaks of hepatitis A in unprecedented numbers during the vaccine era (1). As of May 2020, 33 states had reported hepatitis A outbreaks involving approximately 32 500 cases, 19 800 (61%) hospitalizations, and 320 deaths since 2016 (1). These infections are spreading primarily through close contact among persons who use drugs and persons experiencing homelessness, as well as among men who have sex with men (MSM) (2).

"During these outbreaks, hepatitis A infections occurring among food handlers have raised public alarm and resulted in calls for vaccinating all food handlers, often prompting health departments to divert limited resources away from populations at risk. However, the risk for secondary transmission from hepatitis A-infected food handlers to food establishment patrons is not well understood. To characterize this risk, a novel, structured survey was developed and conducted using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) (version 9.5.13; Vanderbilt University); among 30 state health departments reporting person-to-person hepatitis A outbreaks during 1 Jul 2016-13 Sep 2019, 29 states responded (3,4).

"[A total of] 26 states (89.7%) submitted complete information regarding secondary transmission events associated with food handlers (Table; see original URL for Table. - Mod.LL). Among 22 825 hepatitis A outbreak cases reported from these 26 states during 1 Jul 2016-13 Sep 2019, 871 (3.8%) were among food handlers; 587 (67.4%) hepatitis A-infected food handlers reported one or more risk factors (i.e., drug use, unstable housing, or homelessness, MSM, or incarceration) during the 15-50 days before symptom onset. Associated with these 871 hepatitis A-infected food handlers were 8 (0.9%) secondary transmission events (Table), which resulted in 57 secondary cases.

"Of 29 states, 18 (62.1%) submitted complete information for public health response activities related to hepatitis A-infected food handlers. Among 275 cases in food handlers from these 18 states, 271 (98.5%) investigations and 63 (22.9%) public notifications took place.

"Ongoing hepatitis A outbreaks have been prolonged and costly to control (5). These study findings indicate that the risk for secondary infection from hepatitis A-infected food handlers to food establishment patrons in these outbreaks is low (less than 1%). Therefore, public health efforts to preemptively vaccinate all food handlers would be ineffective at mitigating the current risk for person-to-person outbreaks. To optimize resources, health departments should assess the risk for secondary transmission of hepatitis A from infected food handlers on a case-by-case basis and prioritize vaccination efforts in situations where secondary transmission risk is deemed high (6).

"Approximately 2/3 of the hepatitis A-infected food handlers in this survey reported risk factors commonly associated with the current person-to-person outbreaks. This underscores the importance of vaccination strategies targeting the populations at highest risk (i.e., persons who use drugs, persons experiencing unstable housing or homelessness, MSM, and persons who are or were recently incarcerated) as the cornerstone of an effective public health response."

It is likely, but unstated, that the food handler index case here was unimmunized, and this substantial cluster could have been avoided if routine immunization of food handlers were the rule. An outbreak of hepatitis A with 23 confirmed cases was traced to a food handler who worked in the kitchen of a private Morris County, NJ, country club in 2019. Outbreaks such as these may not change the statistics but might push public health authorities to a plan to immunize food handlers against HAV. Although now part of childhood immunization programs in the USA, many adults in the developed world are susceptible.

Spillover of HAV from the current multistate large epidemic involving the homeless and/or substance-abusing populations into food handlers certainly likely occurs. An outbreak linked to a restaurant is a public relations nightmare and could be a financial disaster for the restaurant.

As of 8 Oct 2021 (https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/outbreaks/2017March-HepatitisA.htm), since the hepatitis A outbreaks were first identified in 2016, 36 states have publicly reported the following:
Cases: 42 666
Hospitalizations: 25 953 (61%)
Deaths: 391

It is not clear if the index case in a food handler here was related to this ongoing epidemic. - Mod.LL
