Dengue may have claimed 2 more victims in the
cities of Itapetinga and Itabuna. According to
the Secretariat of Health of the state of Bahia
(SESAB), 6 deaths were already confirmed
(including 5 children) since 1 Jan 2009.

Besides these 2 deaths, there is a 3rd under
analysis, which [if positive for DHF] would bring
to 9 the number of dengue cases in the state this
year [2009]. In 2008, 15 people died of dengue in
Bahia.

In 2009, already more than 6500 cases have been reported in Bahia. The
cities of Itabuna in the southern part of the state and Jequie in the
southwest are facing an outbreak of disease and have declared an
emergency. In this period, 6567 cases of the disease have been
reported, according to the latest epidemiological bulletin published
by SESAB on Wednesday [18 Feb 2009].

In Bolivia's worst national outbreak in a decade,
19 people have died from dengue fever since
January 2009, and 31 000 people have been
affected, official estimates have showed.

According to an official toll cited by ATB
television yesterday [26 Feb 2009], 12 people
died from the disease in the tropical eastern
region of Santa Cruz; 3 others died in central, 2
others in the Andean west [areas], and one in the
capital city of La Paz.

A Bolivian national died on arriving in
neighboring Peru, and health minister Ramiro
Tapia said that one additional death brought the
overall death toll to 19.

A total of 30 870 dengue cases have been counted
-- 71 percent of them in Santa Cruz, the region
most affected by the outbreak and where
authorities have declared a health emergency --
and in Beni, Pando and Cochabamba departments
[state or province equivalent]. More than 15 000
troops have been mobilized to assist health teams.

[The report indicates that individuals infected
by dengue virus in Bolivia are traveling to other
neighboring countries where they become ill and
present a risk of spreading the virus to places
where vector _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes are
abundant.

A BBC News report from 26 Feb 2009
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7912677.stm>
indicated that Bolivia is experiencing the worst
dengue outbreak in the country's history.
Assistance is being provided to Bolivian health
authorities by Venezuela, Cuba, Paraguay, Japan
and the World Health Organization. On 20 Feb
2009, the Pan American Health Organization
reported 80 cases of the lethal dengue
hemorrhagic fever in Bolivia since the beginning
of the year (2009), of which they were reporting
a very high 22 percent case fatality rate. Those
suffering from dengue fever have about a one
percent chance of progressing to dengue
hemorrhagic fever, according the USA Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The global
average case-fatality ratio for dengue
hemorrhagic fever is 5 percent, the CDC reports,
adding that fatalities can be kept below one
percent with proper medical care.

In Pueblo Nuevo de Parrita in Puntarenas
[province], 171 neighbors have become ill with
dengue [virus infections] in recent weeks. This
outbreak has concerned specialists in the Caja
Costarricense de Seguro Social (CCSS) [the Costa
Rican national health agency]. Edgar Carrillo,
Director of the local health area, and Raul
Pacheco, regional epidemiologist, explained that
the increase in cases has required the
implementation of an educational and public
awareness campaign among the neighbors.

In contrast, in Limon [across the country on the
Caribbean coast], the Ministry of Health reported
142 dengue fewer cases than in 2008.

On 27 Feb 2009 the ministry will hold its first national drive to
prevent cases of this disease. It will include non-traditional garbage
collection, elimination of standing water, inspection of gutters, and
general inspection and clean-up of areas outside buildings and homes.
During the year [2009], there will be 5 more national drives against
dengue.

A dengue fever outbreak has claimed 104 lives in
Indonesia's Banten province this month [February
2009], health officials said Monday [24 Feb
2009]. Ignatius Darya, a spokesman for Misi
Rangkasbitung Hospital, said the number is
expected to increase through March 2009, the
month the disease traditionally peaks for the
year, the state news agency ANTARA said. "The
number of dengue patients treated at the hospital
has increased by a 3rd this month [February 2009]
to 90 cases when compared to last month, [January
2009]," Darya said.

However, those patients were recovering after
being treated quickly and properly, he said. "The
residents here don't really understand the
illness and how to prevent it. They live in
densely populated neighborhoods with poor
hygiene," he added.

North Queensland's dengue fever epidemic broke
new territory yesterday [26 Feb 2009] as health
officials confirmed a 4th strain of the virus in
the region. Dengue cases have been reported in
Cairns, Townsville, Port Douglas and for the 1st
time in recorded history, at Yarrabah, Injinoo
and Innisfail.

The number of Cairns people infected soared to
513 yesterday [26 Feb 2009], making it the city's
worst outbreak of the potentially deadly disease.

"That's over a period of 3 months compared to
previous outbreaks of 14 months," said Queensland
Health physician Frank Beard. "The rapid
spreading nature of the outbreak is a 1st for us.
We haven't seen anything quite like this."

Townsville has recorded 70 cases, Port Douglas 2,
Yarrabah 2, and Injinoo and Innisfail both have
one case each.

Authorities have linked the latest case in
Innisfail to a traveler from Vanuatu. That case
introduces a 4th strain of the virus to the
north, a fact that is causing huge concerns about
people contracting the more serious form of the
disease, DHF.

"We now currently have all 4 types of dengue
circulating in north Queensland, which is the 1st
time ever," Dr Beard said. "If you get 2 doses of
dengue [virus infection] of different types, then
you're at higher risk of serious complications.

"We recommend that anyone who has had dengue
before take extra precautions such as wearing
personal repellent regularly during the day,
using mozzie [mosquito] zappers or mosquito coils
inside, using surface sprays."

Cairns Base Hospital staff have treated one
suspected case of dengue DHF in the latest
epidemic, with the patient requiring intensive
care.

Meanwhile, a Cairns resident was fined AUD 400
[USD 260] this week after mosquito larvae were
found in water-filled tires on a property. Cairns
Regional Council health officers issued the
on-the-spot fine, the 1st under heavy penalties
aimed at deterring dengue mosquito breeding.

The Australian Veterinary, Pesticides and
Medicines Authority has given approval for a
different insecticide to be tried against dengue
mosquitoes, after evidence some insects may have
become resistant to the commonly-used variety.

[Autochthonous (locally-transmitted)dengue appeared in Cairns in 1995:
see ProMED archive Dengue - Australia 19950822.0724. Northern
Queensland is indeed unfortunate for now having all 4 dengue virus
serotypes circulating there. It would be of interest to know what the
old insecticide was, what the new insecticide is and how effective the
results of its application are.

Dengue Fever Imported from West Africa to France
between 2006 and 2008: Genotyping of Pathogens
and Public Health Platform, Paris, France

3. Institut Pasteur

In July 2006, notification of confirmed viraemic,
symptomatic dengue infections imported to France
became mandatory. Cases are confirmed either by
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or by serology
(detection of specific IgM).

From 1 Jul 2006 to 15 Aug 2008, 117 dengue cases imported to
metropolitan France have been reported through the mandatory
notification system. Of the 117 patients, 12 came from West Africa, of
whom 7 came from Cote d'Ivoire. The number and the proportion of
patients returning from West African countries increased significantly
in 2008 up to 15 Aug 2008 (7.5 months) when compared to the 18
month-period from July 2006 to December 2007 (8/30 = 26.7 percent
versus 4/87 = 4.6 percent; p less than 0.002). Of the 12 patients from
West African countries, only one (8 percent) had minor hemorrhagic
symptoms, whereas 28/105 (27 percent) patients returning from other
countries had minor (25 cases) and major (3 cases) hemorrhagic
symptoms (p = 0.15).

Thrombocytopenia (platelets less than or equal to
100 000/mL) was documented for 27 percent of
patients returning from West Africa and for 49
percent of the remaining patients (p = 0.18). The
only serotype identified in 2008, DENV-3, has
never been detected in West Africa. Syndromic
surveillance allowed an ongoing surveillance of
mortality during the outbreak that was near real
time and was useful for public health authorities.

Despite a probably low level of completeness, the
mandatory notification surveillance system in
France allows monitoring of the trends of imported
cases. Since the beginning of 2008, dengue cases
imported from West Africa, particularly from Cote
d'Ivoire, are increasing. This could be due to
increased dengue circulation in this area. The
introduction of a new serotype could have an
important epidemic potential and be associated
with a higher proportion of severe forms. This
could have public health implications for
epidemiological surveillance and management of
patients locally.
