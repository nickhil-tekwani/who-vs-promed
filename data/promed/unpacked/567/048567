Unidentified Hemorrhagic Fever Causes Many Deaths in Northern Uganda
--------------------------------------------------------------------
GULU: on 13 Oct 2000, it was reported that at least 30 people in this
northern Uganda town have died in recent weeks of a hemorrhagic fever that
authorities fear may be caused by the Ebola or Marburg virus. Blood samples
from victims of the outbreak, which has produced tell-tale bleeding from
every orifice in many patients here, are being flown to high-security
laboratories in South Africa and at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta. Investigators who rushed here this week said tests
may identify the fever's cause by early next week. They said several
elements of the outbreak, including the infection of medical personnel,
suggest [involvement of a member of the family _Filoviridae_, the family of
viruses that includes the Ebola and Marburg viruses.
A total of 3 of the 10 people who died of the virus since 30 Sep 2000 in
one Gulu hospital were nursing students who probably cared for infected
patients. Ugandan health officials said at least 20 others have perished
with similar symptoms at a second hospital or at home. In one cluster of
huts not far from the center of town, 8 people have died since 20 Sep 2000.
Officials from the Uganda Ministry of Health and the World Health
Organization told residents to avoid direct contact with the sick and to
rush them to local hospitals where doctors have tried to establish
isolation wards.
Ebola and Marburg are the most lethal of the hemorrhagic fever viruses that
have emerged in recent decades, notably in Africa. Ebola virus was first
identified in 1976 in the Congo and Sudan, both of which border Uganda, and
has since flared up at several other sites. The first sustained outbreak of
either virus continues in northeast Congo, where local men working an
abandoned gold mine have suffered a steady stream of Marburg virus
infections since mid-1998.

Mystery disease in Uganda
-------------------------
An outbreak of a mystery disease is centered on the northern town of Gulu.
About 30 people have died from an as-yet unidentified disease in northern
Uganda. Health experts, including officials from the World Health
Organisation left for Uganda's northern Gulu District on Fri 13 Oct 2000 to
investigate the outbreak. The Ugandan Ministry of Health said on Thursday
that 42 cases of the disease have been reported. Symptoms include fever,
muscle pains and bleeding from the mouth, nose and anus. Those symptoms
have led doctors to suspect that the disease is a hemorrhagic fever, of
which the best known are Marburg and Ebola. The first death occurred on 17
Sep 2000. The victim was reportedly a soldier who had recently served in
the Democratic Republic of Congo. An agency (AFP) report states that many
other victims have lived near the army barracks. Blood samples have been
sent to South Africa and the United States for testing in an effort to
identify the disease.
