A Comment on the incidence of Human Coronavirus NL63 in Brisbane, Australia
---------------------------------------------------
Our recent findings (J.Med.Virol. (2005), Vol.75, Iss.3) reported that
HCoV-NL63 occurred in 2.2 percent of patients attending hospitals and
general practitioners. In 62 percent of NL63-positive subjects this was
the only microbe detected, the greatest proportion of detections occurred
in the cooler months surrounding winter, and in 81 percent of positive
patients subjected to medical review, a clinical diagnosis of lower
respiratory tract disease was made. Whilst not representing a generous
proportion of the undiagnosed population, our study may have represented an
"off-season" year, as Ebihara et al. proposed in the same issue of
J.Med.Virol. Esper's recent discovery of an NH strain of HCoV-NL63 among
8.8 percent of children <5yrs of age serves to support this theory.
Review of nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences from the NH strains
indicate that all but one are 97-100 percent homologous to the NL63
prototype strain. Clearly variants of HCoV-NL63 exist, therefore we believe
that the incidence values for this virus are likely to change
significantly, as HCoV-NL63-like species improved assays are designed for
the detection of all. It was also interesting to note that the NH NL63
variant was detected more frequently during the summer months (10 percent)
than the winter months (7.7 percent) in this undefined paediatric population.
It is perhaps not surprising that recent reports have confirmed HCoV-NL63
to be a global pathogen. Because of this we recommend that HCoV-NL63-like
viruses be considered in the diagnosis of acute lower respiratory tract
disease among the young, the elderly, and the immunocompromised and as a
co-pathogen of as-yet-undefined significance. Studies should not be limited
to particular seasons based on earlier HCoV disease paradigms, since much
of what we knew of HCoV-mediated disease would appear to have changed
significantly in recent months.

[The novel lower respiratory tract disease-associated coronaviruses
described in the Netherlands in 2004 (designated HCoV-NL-63) and this year
in the United States (designated the New Haven Coronavirus) appear to be
closely related, probably globally distributed and responsible for
appreciable respiratory disease in the human population. The
_Coronaviridae_ study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of
Viruses (ICTV) will in due course have to decide whether these viruses
represent distinct species or strains of the same species. Dr Mackay's work
argues for the existence of viruses of differing biological
characteristics, while leaving their taxonomic status open. - Mod.CP]
