these, 86 were imported cases with history of travel to Johor (69

Sri Lanka (2 cases), India (2 cases) and the Maldives (one case). The

[Most of the imported cases of chikungunya virus infection have come
from Malaysia (see ProMED archive no. 20080904.2768). The above
article indicates how extensive international movement of chikungunya
virus-infected individuals is in Asia, and underscores the risk that
long-distance dissemination that movement of this virus poses.
