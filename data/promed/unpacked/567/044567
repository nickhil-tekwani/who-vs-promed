The Pinal County Public Health Services District is issuing a rabies
advisory, urging Pinal County residents to have their animals
vaccinated against the fatal disease.

On 20 Apr 2010, a resident of Mammoth was attacked by a bobcat while
outside his home in his yard. The bobcat lunged from under a parked
vehicle and caused numerous bite and scratch injuries to the victim
before friends assisted, beating it with sticks and a gardening hoe
until it ran off. The man received medical attention for his wounds.

The bobcat then got into a fight with a family dog a few blocks away
before being shot by a local resident.

After submitting the dead bobcat for testing, the Arizona State
Public Health Laboratory notified Pinal County on 21 Apr 2010 that
the bobcat was positive for rabies. The victim is continuing to
receive prophylactic therapy to prevent the rabies infection.

Unfortunately, the dog that was attacked was unvaccinated. Since the
dog could develop rabies infection, it will now need to be euthanized
to protect the family and the public.

This is the 6th rabid animal identified in Pinal County so far in
2010. Five of the 6 rabid animals in the county have been found in
the southern and eastern parts of the county. Three skunks, one bat,
and a coatimundi have tested positive in addition to the bobcat.
While this is the 1st human bitten by a rabid animal this year
[2010], 8 domestic animals have been exposed to rabid animals,
resulting in euthanasia of 4.

"Owners of dogs and cats need to keep in mind the importance of
rabies shots for their pets. We never want to take a family pet away
from the home but are left with no choice if there is a chance it
could develop rabies and spread it to other animals or even people.
Rabies is basically 100 percent fatal once symptoms [in people] or
clinical signs [in animals] appear, and that is a risk we cannot
afford to take with people's lives. A simple shot would both prevent
rabies in your pet and keep us from having to euthanize animals that
are exposed," said Tom Schryer, director of Pinal County Public Health.

The identification of rabid animals statewide serves as a reminder of
the potential for rabies in wild animals in Arizona. Rabies is an
infectious disease that affects the nervous system, including the
brain and spinal cord of animals and humans. It is caused by a virus
present in the saliva of infected animals and is transmitted to
humans through contact with the live virus [which is generally
through saliva or other body fluids - Mod.TG]. Rabies is fatal to
humans once symptoms appear. There has not been a documented case of
human rabies in Pinal County for decades; however, every year in
Pinal County, there are several humans exposed to rabid animals.

"Aggressive behavior or bites associated with wild animals should
always be reported to state or county officials," Schryer said.
"Providing rabies shots to humans immediately after exposure to a
rabid animal saves lives [This is generally called post exposure
prophylaxis. - Mod.TG]. Wild animals generally tend to be shy around
humans and avoid contact. Any time a wild animal displays overtly
aggressive behavior, it causes concern for rabies. The best thing to
do if you see a wild animal acting strangely is to keep as much
distance as possible and report it to your local animal control department."

While human exposures to rabid animals are rare, family pets are more
often exposed to wild animals, including wild animals that are rabid.
Pets should be vaccinated against rabies. The vaccine is available at
veterinary offices or through county animal care and control.

Rabies can occur in animals anywhere in the county. In the last few
years, the southern and eastern portions of Pinal County have had the
most activity. Rabies is found mainly in wild animals such as bats,
skunks, foxes, raccoons, bobcats and coyotes. Cats, dogs, and
livestock can also become infected with rabies if they are bitten by
rabid wild animals and have not been vaccinated. Rodents such as
rats, mice, gerbils, guinea pigs and squirrels are not likely to be
infected with rabies [but they are still susceptible to the virus -
Mod.TG]. Wild animals exhibiting unusual behavior should be reported
to local animal control officials.

The 1st sign of rabies is usually a change in the animal's behavior.
Animals may act more aggressive or more tame than usual. Animals
usually active at night such as skunks, foxes and bats may be out
during the day. Rabid animals may appear agitated and excited or
paralyzed and frightened. Sometimes, rabid animals do not show any
signs of illness before death from rabies. That is why contact with
wild animals should always be avoided.

The Pinal County Public Health Services District recommends the
following precautions:

* Keep people and pets away from wild animals. Do not pick up, touch
or feed wild or unfamiliar animals, especially sick or wounded ones.
If someone has been bitten or scratched, or has had contact with the
animal, report it immediately to animal control or health officials.

*Do not "rescue" seemingly abandoned young wild animals. Usually, the
mother will return. If the mother is dead or has not returned in many
hours, call the Arizona Game and Fish Department.

*Vaccinate all dogs and cats against rabies. Pets should be kept in a
fenced yard.

*Take precautions when camping, hunting or fishing. Avoid sleeping on
the open ground without the protection of a closed tent or camper.
Keep pets on a leash and do not allow them to wander.

*Do not disturb roosting bats. If you find a bat on the ground, don't
touch it. Report the bat and its location to your local animal
control officer or health department. Place a box over the bat to
contain it. Be careful not to damage the bat in any way since it must
be intact for rabies testing.

Health Services District at (520) 866-7138 or the Arizona Department
of Health Services at (602) 364-4562.

[Indications from this article imply the man who was attacked is
receiving post exposure prophylaxis for rabies exposure.

Even if wild animals have not been reported, it is most important to
vaccinate your pets, including livestock. As this story so vividly
indicates, a wild animal or even a domestic animal infected with
rabies can spring out of anywhere when least expected and attack your
pet. How sad this family lost their pet because they did not have the
animal vaccinated. A vaccination against rabies is cheap insurance
for you and your pet.

I do not diminish the severity of the situation of the individual who
was attacked. It had to be a very frightening experience, but we do
live in an age when prompt medical treatment and prophylaxis
developments can save lives. I wish the individual well and,
thankfully, there were those who could help rescue him. - Mod.TG]
