[We are presuming, at this time, that this is a bovine outbreak because the report carries a picture of some Holstein cows. But that may be just journalistic freedom using some picture to hand. On the other hand if it had involved a single sheep or goat, it is unlikely to noticed, much less diagnosed. If any further details of this outbreak can be provided, it would be appreciated, and especially confirming the event as it was informally reported and also on the probable source of the infection. - Mod MHJ
