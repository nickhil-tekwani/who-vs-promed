The head of public health services at the Ministry of Health, Sharon Elroi-Price, today [Mon 7 Mar 2022] referred to the case in Jerusalem where a 4-year-old girl with polio was diagnosed, saying that "there are at least tens or hundreds more infections (which are probably asymptomatic). We do not expect there to be a wave of children coming with symptoms, but we understand that the virus is spreading. A vaccinated child is protected."

In a conversation with journalists, Elroi-Price emphasized: "We are very far from an uncontrollable outbreak, we prevent it by locating those around the case and vaccinating the unvaccinated among them. Elroi-Price added that her office wants to "make sure that all the children, especially in the Jerusalem district, are in an optimal vaccination status, meaning they have undergone the complete childhood vaccination regime according to the recommendations of the Ministry of Health. Regarding polio, there are 4 vaccinations given during the first year of life. The current recommendations are to precede the first vaccination, momentarily only in the Jerusalem district, to 6 weeks and the 2nd one to 12 weeks of age, in order to make sure earlier protection is conferred.

She noted that the District Health Bureau and the Jerusalem Municipality are conducting an extensive investigation, and that a project manager has been recruited to locate the people who were in close contact with the child who was diagnosed with polio yesterday [Sun 6 Mar 2022], "extending the sampling of sewage to more locations within and around the focus for fecal cultures, to fence the area in question."

According to tests conducted on sewage by the Public health services in the Ministry, the polio virus is only found in the Jerusalem area.

Yesterday [Sun 6 Mar 2022], the Ministry of Health announced that a 4-year-old girl from Jerusalem had been diagnosed with polio, the first case in Israel since 1988. The girl has not been vaccinated against the virus as part of routine vaccinations. The girl was brought for treatment in Hadassah Ein Kerem. Prof. Shimon Reif, director of the children's department at the hospital said the initial suspicion was raised due to neurological symptoms like weakness in the leg muscles and other symptoms. "Tests conducted involving a pediatric neurologist confirmed that it was polio," Reif said. The girl was treated at the hospital for one week, and after her condition improved, she was transferred to rehabilitative treatment due to a muscular injury - a familiar phenomenon among polio patients.

The Ministry of Health also announced that the Jerusalem District Health Bureau has opened an epidemiological investigation, approaching contacts for specific guidance. According to the findings of the investigation further recommendations will be decided upon.

The polio strain that the girl was infected with is one of the strains found in the vaccine, which has been genetically modified and may cause disease in those who are not vaccinated against the virus. As far as is known, the infected girl developed symptoms manifested by weakness on one side of the body, but did not need to be hospitalized. The case was later discovered by the Ministry's performed routine monitoring of sewage in the area where the girl lives. Such a finding sometimes appears in the monitoring, but so far no cases of morbidity have been detected.

The polio vaccine is given in 4 doses, at the ages of 2, 4, 6 and 12 months of age. An additional booster is given at school at the age of 7. The vaccination rate, with the 4 doses among those born in 2020 in Jerusalem, is 83%, but there are areas where the vaccination rates are particularly low and stand at about 50%. The Ministry of Health is currently segmenting the population to concentrate efforts and vaccinate those who have not yet been vaccinated.

Following the polio case, the head of the public health services, Dr. Sharon Elroi-Price, held a briefing for the ultra-Orthodox media and warned of the risk of not being vaccinated. "70-80% of those infected will not suffer from symptoms, but there is a situation where the virus penetrates the bloodstream to the nervous system and can in a percentage of cases cause neurological symptoms of paralysis, weakness, and can even damage the respiratory muscles to the point of respiratory assistance."

The head of the health service added that "the virus is preventable. The vaccine can be given and is very effective and safe. The vaccine is based on a killed virus to protect the people who get it - but to eradicate polio, a combination of live attenuated vaccine is needed. The children first receive the vaccine from the killed virus and only then the attenuated live vaccine.

"The purpose of the attenuated live vaccine is to produce antibodies in the digestive tract so that they cannot be carriers of the virus and infect others. The killed vaccine protects against the virus, and the animal protects against the transmission of the virus."

Dr. Elroi-Price told reporters that "in 2005 it was decided to stop giving the attenuated live vaccine after they came to the conclusion that they had managed to eradicate the polio virus, however in 2013 the polio virus was identified in the south and it was decided to do a 2-drop operation. In 2014, it was decided to return the attenuated live and killed vaccine that has always been part of the vaccination program in Israel."

Dr. Elroi Price expanded on the various monitoring methods in Israel, one through the sewage system and the other through the doctors, noting that "recently a polio virus has been identified in the sewage and we see it recurring at several points and we believe the virus is already circulating in the Jerusalem area."

Dr. Elroi-Price went on to refer to a case found in recent days and said: "We do not specify the gender of the patient but for convenience say a child about 4 years old, not vaccinated, came to the pediatrician 2 weeks ago with symptoms of lower body weakness and falls. The first sample was negative for polio, but repeated samples were found positive for polio and were defined as verified for polio.

"In polio, the clinical cases are the tip of the iceberg," stressed Elroi-Price. "When there is someone who manifests symptoms, it means that there are dozens and hundreds of others who already have the virus. When a child is identified with a neurological symptom, it is the tip of the iceberg and more must be sought.

"Last night we received confirmation of the diagnosis, we opened an epidemiological investigation, contact was made with the kindergarten and contacts. We sent a message to the medical directors at the HMOs, informing them that there was a case and drawing their attention to being vigilant."

According to Elroi-Price: "The epidemiological investigation revealed that there are 10 contacts that are considered close within the family, and 20 more children and staff in the kindergarten. The investigation with the family is in processes and includes retrieving fecal samples."

The head of the public health services noted that "irreversible damage may be caused to the infected, children and adults. Children who have not been vaccinated should get vaccinated. Even in schools - this is the moment to get vaccinated" she pleaded.

However, Elroi-Price asked to reassure the public, noting that "due to confidentiality, it is not possible to specify [geographic area?], but at the moment what can still be said, is that the virus was detected in sewage only in the Jerusalem area and not elsewhere. We will increase sewage monitoring throughout the country, especially in Jerusalem "To locate the area more accurately,".

She noted that the Ministry of Health has assisted its Mother and child care stations with additional manpower to reinforce the queue and to extend the hours of operation beyond the ordinary ones. "Right now, we are building a plan that will address this." Dr. Elroi asked the ultra-Orthodox reporters to assist in transmitting the information and necessity of immunization to reach all sectors of the ultra-Orthodox population.

[The above media reports fill in some of the blanks raised in yesterday's post (see Poliomyelitis update (09): Israel (JM) VDPV, MOH, RFI 20220307.8701864). The population involved is the ultra-Orthodox community; a section of the population that has had suboptimal vaccination coverages through the years and has consequently had outbreaks of measles as a result of this. Preliminary results of epidemiologic investigation identified 30 known contacts at risk, but the prudent action taken by the public health sector to increase environmental sampling country-wide in order to cast a wide net and not miss the introduction to communities outside of Jerusalem.

We are still awaiting the results of genomic studies on the isolated virus.
