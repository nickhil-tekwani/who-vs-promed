The 1st finding of tiger influenza by virus isolation and specific gene
amplification (China)
--------------------------------------------------
As Thailand ordered a cull of tigers suspected of suffering from bird flu
yesterday, readers are referred to a journal review of a paper published in
the China Journal of Veterinary Science in 2003, demonstrating that tigers
died of influenza virus infection in China in 2002. The sequence of NP
protein indicated an influenza A virus infection. Though the subtype of the
influenza A virus is not mentioned in the paper, the phylogenetic analysis
showed great similarity between the NP gene of A/Tiger/Harbin/2/2002 and
A/duck anyang/AVL/1/2001 (H5N1) and A/goose/Guangdong/1/96 (H5N1).
We are indebted to Mr. Tao Wei for his work in extracting and translating
the phylogenetic and sequence data from the original Chinese file and
presenting us with the image files [to be seen in the above web-site].

[Yang Li is kindly acknowledged for this update, showing that the
susceptibility of tigers to avian influenza had been demonstrated, most
likely, in 2002 in China. Clearly, the Chinese scientific literature on
animal health deserves to be followed more closely and continuously by the
international scientific community. - Mod.AS]
