Yellow fever in Cote d'Ivoire - update
--------------------------------------
More than 700 000 people were vaccinated against yellow fever [YF] in
the recent emergency vaccination campaign in Cote d'Ivoire led by the
Ministry of Health with support from WHO and UNICEF.

The campaign, conducted from 21-28 Jan 2011, reached 88 per cent of
the targeted population in the districts of Katiola, Beoumi (in the
center of the country), Seguela, and Mankono (in the north). The high
vaccination coverage results were validated by a field survey
conducted by WHO the next day following the campaign.

Suspected cases of yellow fever were notified by Cote d'Ivoire on 3
Jan 2011, and 12 cases were laboratory confirmed on 17 Jan 2011 by the
regional reference laboratory, Institut Pasteur in Dakar. The outbreak
has affected the districts of Seguela (14 cases, including 10 deaths),
Mankono (1 case), Beoumi (18 cases including 9 deaths) and Katiola (46
cases, including 16 deaths).

[It is reassuring to learn that the YF vaccination campaign is moving
forward with good coverage, given the unsettled political situation in
Cote d'Ivoire. The report above provides an update of cases by
affected districts.
