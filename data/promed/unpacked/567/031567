Outbreak of bacterial disease in Hawke's Bay hives
--------------------------------------------------
The Hawke's Bay Beekeepers president says a significant outbreak of
American foul brood disease in the region highlights the need for the
Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry [MAF] to prosecute irresponsible
beekeepers.

The bacterial disease, first recorded in New Zealand in 1877, is the
most widespread and destructive of the brood diseases.

John Berry says an outbreak in the Waiohiki area on the southern
outskirts of Napier led to 30 hives having to be destroyed by
burning.

The biggest problem is that MAF won't prosecute anybody, he says. One
beekeeper in the area last year [2010] was found to have dead hives at
5 of 7 sites, but was not prosecuted.

Mr Berry says hives found dead in spring due to American foul brood
means they've been infected for months.

He says a bad outbreak can kill clean hives within several kilometres
of infected ones.

American foul brood (AFB) is an infectious disease of the larval stage
of the honeybee _Apis mellifera_ and other _Apis_ spp, and occurs
throughout the world where such bees are kept. _Paenibacillus larvae_,
the causative organism, is a Gram positive bacterium that can produce
over one billion spores in each infected larva. The bacterium is a
round-ended, straight and sometimes curved rod, which varies greatly
in size (0.5 micron wide by 1.5 to 6 micron long), occurring singly
and in chains and filaments; some strains are motile. The sporangia
are often sparse in vitro, and the ellipsoidal, central to subterminal
spores, which may swell the sporangia, are often found free. The
spores are extremely heat stable and resistant to chemical agents.
Only spores are capable of inducing the disease.

The infection can be transmitted to larvae by nurse bees or by spores
remaining at the base of a brood cell. Although the larval stages of
worker bees, drones, and queens are susceptible to infection, infected
queens and drone larvae are rarely seen under natural conditions. The
susceptibility of larvae to AFB disease decreases with increasing age;
larvae cannot be infected later than 53 hours after the egg has
hatched. The mean infective dose (LD50= spore dose at which 50 percent
of the larvae are killed) needed to initiate infection, though very
variable, is 8.49 spores in 24-48 hour-old bee larvae. Exchanging
combs containing the remains of diseased brood is the most common way
of spreading the disease from colony to colony. In addition, feeding
or robbing of spore-laden honey or bee bread, package bees, and the
introduction of queens from infected colonies can also spread the
disease. Wax contaminated with the spores of _P. larvae_, which are
used in the production of comb foundation, can also spread the
disease. The early detection of AFB helps to prevent further spread.

The information above has been derived from chapter 2.2.2. "American
foul brood of honey bees" of OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests and
Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals, 2009. The chapter, which includes
exhaustive, illustrated information on the diagnosis of AFB and
references, is available at
http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.02.02_AMERICAN_FOULBROOD.pdf.
(The commentary above was provided by Mod.AS)

Bee larvae up to 3 days old become infected by ingesting spores of the
bacterium that are present in their food. Spores germinate in the gut
of the larva, and the vegetative form begins to grow, taking its
nourishment from the larva. Spores will not germinate in larvae over 3
days old. Bacterial growth causes the eventual death of the larva. The
vegetative form of the bacterium will die but not before it produces
many millions of spores. Each dead larva may contain as many as 100
million spores.

Disease spreads rapidly throughout the hive as the bees, attempting to
remove the spore-laden dead larvae, contaminate brood food. Nectar
stored in contaminated cells will contain spores, and soon the brood
chamber becomes filled with contaminated honey. As this honey is moved
up into the supers, the entire hive becomes contaminated with spores.
When the colony becomes weak from AFB infection, robber bees may enter
and take contaminated honey back to their hives, thereby spreading the
disease to other colonies and apiaries. Beekeepers also may spread
disease by moving equipment (frames or supers) from contaminated hives
to healthy ones.

American foul brood spores are extremely resistant to desiccation and
can remain viable for more than 40 years in honey and beekeeping
equipment. Therefore, honey from an unknown source should never be
used as bee feed, and used beekeeping equipment should be assumed
contaminated unless known to be otherwise.

Terramycin (oxytetracycline) is the only drug approved in the US for
use against AFB. When present in the food given to susceptible bee
larvae, this antibiotic is effective in preventing germination of AFB
spores. The bees are then able to develop and mature normally.
Terramycin will not kill the spores and is not a means for sterilizing
either the bees or the equipment. If a colony contains AFB spores and
is maintained in a healthy condition through treatment with
terramycin, the disease will recur when the drug treatment is
discontinued.

It is a good practice to treat with terramycin (TM) on a preventative
basis. The terramycin should be mixed with powdered sugar in a ratio
which depends on the strength of the drug. Treatment of a beehive
consists of sprinkling 2 tablespoons of the TM and sugar mixture over
the tops of the brood frames. Preventative treatment should consist of
2 treatments about one week apart in the spring, at least 4 weeks
before putting on surplus honey supers, and another one or 2
treatments in the fall after taking off the honey supers.

To treat a diseased colony, apply 3 to 4 treatments of the TM-sugar
mixture at about weekly intervals. If these treatments must be done
during the summer with the honey supers on, they should be left on the
colony over the winter for bee feed, because the terramycin will get
into the honey supers and, therefore, contaminate the honey. Diseased
colonies that do not respond to 3 or 4 treatments of terramycin should
be destroyed.

Diseased colonies that must be destroyed can be killed with resmethrin
insecticide that comes in an aerosol can and is available from bee
supply dealers. Bees should be killed at a time when there is no
flight. The frames and combs should be burned in a pit and the ashes
covered. The heavy woodenware (supers, tops, and bottoms, etc) may be
sterilized by scraping them clean (the scrapings should be burned) and
scorching the inside surfaces. The scorching can be done with a
propane torch; particular attention must be paid to cracks and
corners. If large quantities of supers are to be scorched, they may be
stacked and painted inside with kerosene and lit. Keep a cover handy
to extinguish the flames when the wood is sufficiently scorched. To
sterilize large quantities of equipment, it might be worthwhile to set
up a barrel with a boiling lye solution of 1 lb. of lye to 10 gallons
of water. The woodenware should be immersed in the solution and boiled
5 to 10 minutes or until clean.

Frames may also be sterilized in this manner. Lye is a very caustic
solution; use extreme care in this process.

Most beekeepers who have had any experience with AFB in their hives
will agree that the best approach is to treat with terramycin on a
preventative basis and inspect colonies regularly. Colonies that show
signs of AFB should be destroyed and the equipment sterilized.

No method of treatment for AFB is completely effective for permanent
control. Beekeepers should inspect their colonies regularly and always
be alert for possible recurrence.
