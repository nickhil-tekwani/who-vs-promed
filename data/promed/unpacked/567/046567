Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever kills 5 in Karachi
---------------------------------------------------
With the death of a 42 year old shepherd from Karachi, who recently passed away at a private hospital from Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF), the number of people who have succumbed to the disease reached 5, health officials said. Prior to his death, 4 other patients -- mainly livestock farmers from Balochistan -- had been brought to the city's private hospitals and had died from CCHF, the deadly viral disease that is transmitted from animals to humans.

The Provincial Dengue Surveillance Cell, which monitors viral disease outbreaks, was reluctant to talk about the disease as they believed it would spread panic among the people. However, its officials said that so far, 5 patients had died at Karachi's hospitals this year, and their laboratory analysis confirmed that they were suffering from CCHF.

Apart from the 42 year old shepherd, a 50 year old man died in the 1st week of January this year 2012], a 17 year old died in April, a 22 year old succumbed to the disease in May, and a 45 year old expired in June. 2 of these patients were admitted to the Aga Khan Hospital and one each to the National Institute of Blood Diseases (NIBD), Liaquat National Hospital (LNH), and Patel Hospital. It is worth mentioning here that only Aga Khan Hospital had the facilities to diagnose CCHF virus through laboratory tests and samples of all the patients were sent for analysis and confirmation. Experts said the viral disease is spread through a tick found on animals and people who deal with dairy farming and livestock were the most likely to catch the deadly virus. Affected patients would become seriously ill from fever, shortness of breath, and hemorrhage and unfortunately, there was no vaccine available to prevent people from falling victim.

Pakistan had been battling with CCHF cases since 2000 and ever since, dozens of patients had died, yet many believed that health authorities were not taking the threat seriously. Experts urged the launch of an awareness campaign about the mode of transmission from animals to humans as thousands of people earned their livelihood through dairy and livestock farming. They added that people needed to be told about precautions that could be taken to protect them from the condition. Similarly, more facilities to diagnose the disease were needed in the provinces of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan as well as well as specialised centers to manage the patients, who often used traditional methods to overcome the illness due to ignorance and lack of knowledge.

A specialised training program for general practitioners should also be launched in all the provinces of the country so that they could refer patients immediately to tertiary-care hospitals in the country.

[The CCHF death toll in Pakistan continues to mount, almost exclusively among people employed in dairying and animal husbandry. It is becoming appreciated that education of those employed in this sector would help to reduce loss of life as a consequence of CCHF infection.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), CCHF was 1st described in the Crimea in 1944 and given the name Crimean haemorrhagic fever. In 1969 it was recognised that the pathogen causing Crimean haemorrhagic fever was the same as that responsible for an illness identified in 1956 in the Congo, and linkage of the 2 place names resulted in the current name for the disease and the virus. The virus which causes CCHF belongs to the genus _Nairovirus_, one of the the 5 genera in the family _Bunyaviridae_. All members of the genus _Nairovirus_ are transmitted by argasid or ixodid ticks. Although primarily a zoonosis, sporadic cases and outbreaks of CCHF affecting humans wherever ticks are prevalent. The disease is now known to be endemic in many countries in Africa, Europe and Asia.

Following infection via tick bite, the incubation period is usually one to 3 days, with a maximum of 9 days and onset of symptoms is sudden, with fever, aching muscles, dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, backache, headache, sore eyes and sensitivity to light. There may be nausea, vomiting and sore throat early on, which may be accompanied by diarrhoea and generalised abdominal pain. Over the next few days, the patient may experience sharp mood swings, and may become confused and aggressive. After 2 to 4 days, the agitation may be replaced by sleepiness, depression and lassitude, and the abdominal pain may localise to the right upper quadrant, with detectable liver enlargement.

The mortality rate from CCHF is about 30 per cent, with death occurring in the 2nd week of illness. In those patients who recover, improvement generally begins on the 9th or 10th day after the onset of illness.
