Brucellosis has been found in a 2nd Park County cattle herd, Wyoming
livestock health officials said on Wednesday [24 Nov 2010], just days after
an earlier outbreak of the disease had been determined to be contained.

The newly detected infection is not related to the earlier case disclosed
in late October [2010], state veterinarian Jim Logan said in a media
release late Wednesday afternoon [25 Nov 2010]. But once again, he said it
appears the cattle were exposed to brucellosis in free-ranging elk.

Historically, the discovery of brucellosis in a 2nd cattle herd would cause
the state's cattle industry to lose its federal "brucellosis-free" status,
but Logan said that likely won't be the case now. Officials with the USDA's
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service have been working on a new
policy that provides some flexibility in how outbreaks are handled, and as
a result, "Wyoming is not in jeopardy of losing its free status as long as
the state is appropriately handling the cases that arise," he said.

Brucellosis can cause spontaneous abortions, infertility, decreased milk
production, and weight loss in cattle, elk, bison, and other mammals. It
persists in herds of wild elk and bison around Yellowstone National Park
and has periodically passed to cattle in Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming.

Loss of a state's "brucellosis-free" status can trigger costly restrictions
on marketing of all cattle from that state. According to the media release,
12 heifers in Park County were tested for brucellosis this fall [2010] when
they were sold, a requirement under the state's brucellosis rules in that
part of the state. 2 of the 12 were found to have been exposed to the
disease. One of the animals was destroyed on 10 Nov 2010, and samples from
the heifer were tested to determine whether it was actually infected. The
infection was confirmed on 24 Nov 2010.

The remaining 11 animals from the group of 12 were tested, along with 250
herd mates, the release said. 8 of those animals were found to have been
exposed to the disease. While a blood test from a live animal can detect
exposure to brucellosis, the only way to confirm actual infection of an
animal is to destroy it.

As a result of the test results, federal officials have designated the herd
as an "affected herd". The Wyoming Livestock Board has quarantined the herd
and another "adjacent" herd, and testing is scheduled to continue on Monday
[29 Nov 2010] on the affected herd and adjacent herds. "Epidemiologic
interviews are under way to determine the extent of this outbreak," the
release said.

Late last week [week of 15 Nov 2010], Logan said officials were preparing
to lift a quarantine of nearly a dozen cattle herds in northern Wyoming
following the earlier case detected in Park County, also believed to have
been caused by contact with infected elk.

The state tested more than 3500 cattle in the county after 4 cows of one
300-head herd were found to have the disease in October [2010]. The herd
and 11 others nearby were quarantined while tests were done to see if the
disease had spread. Officials determined it had not.

In that earlier case, the one herd with the infected cows will remain under
quarantine for about a year and undergo more testing to make sure the
disease is no longer present. The 4 infected cows have been slaughtered. If
more cases are found within the herd, that entire herd may have to be
slaughtered.

In Wednesday's [24 Nov 2010] media release, Logan said the USDA is
preparing to issue a new "interim rule" regarding brucellosis, a result of
a year and a half of discussion among federal officials and state
veterinarians in Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana. He said he met late last week
with USDA regional officials to discuss the implications of the 2 Park
County cases and was given assurance that Wyoming's brucellosis-free status
is not yet in jeopardy. [This is good news for Wyoming. It is also
indicating that the USDA recognizes the challenges of dealing with this
disease in an area that is probably the last reservoir of the disease. It
is a difficult situation as the American bison (buffalo) and the elk are
huge tourist attractions and the buffalo are considered a national herd. -

Logan said the new rule "provides the state and affected herd owners some
flexibility in how situations are handled. We expect to have occasional
brucellosis cases ... since we have the last remaining reservoir of (the
bacteria) in this country in the greater Yellowstone area," Logan said in
the release. "Livestock producers take many precautions to prevent exposure
to wildlife, but there are some situations that even the best management
cannot always avoid."
