[Case count information as of 9 pm EST, 29 Jun 2008]

Since April 2008, 851 persons infected with _Salmonella enterica_
serotype Saintpaul with the same genetic fingerprint have been
identified in 36 states and the District of Columbia. These were
identified because clinical laboratories in all states send strains
to their State public health laboratory for characterization. The
number of ill persons identified in each state is as follows:
Arkansas (10 persons), Arizona (39), California (10), Colorado (11),
Connecticut (4), Florida (1), Georgia (18), Idaho (3), Illinois (91),
Indiana (11), Kansas (14), Kentucky (1), Maine (1), Maryland (29),
Massachusetts (21), Michigan (6), Minnesota (2), Missouri (12), New
Hampshire (3), Nevada (4), New Jersey (4), New Mexico (90), New York
(26), North Carolina (5), Ohio (6), Oklahoma (19), Oregon (10),
Pennsylvania (8), Rhode Island (3), Tennessee (6), Texas (346), Utah
(2), Virginia (22), Vermont (2), Washington (4), Wisconsin (6), and
the District of Columbia (1).

Among the 581 persons with information available, illnesses began
between 10 Apr 2008 and 20 Jun 2008, including 173 who became ill on
1 Jun 2008 or later. Many steps must occur between a person becoming
ill and the determination that the illness was caused by the outbreak
strain; these steps take an average of 2-3 weeks. Therefore, an
illness reported today may have begun 2-3 weeks ago.

Patients range in age from less than 1 to 99 years; 49 percent are
female. The number of illnesses is highest among persons 20 to 29
years old; the number of illnesses is lowest in children 10 to 19
years old and persons greater than 60 years old. At least 105 persons
were hospitalized. No deaths have been officially attributed to this
outbreak.

[As of this posting, 41 more cases of the outbreak strain have been
added to the list with no more states involved so far. More
importantly, the date of onset of illness continues to become later,
now 20 Jun 2008, a full 18 days after the 1st CDC report. For the 1st
time, CDC has quantitated the number of cases (173/892 or 19 percent
of the current total) that have occurred in June 2008. It is not
clear, however, what the distribution of cases throughout the month
is. As more and more cases continue to occur, interest is growing
towards alternative or additional sources of _S._ Saintpaul. As well,
no "smoking tomatoes," tomatoes yielding the outbreak strain, have
been found.- Mod.LL]

Federal investigators retraced their steps Monday [30 Jun 2008] as
suspicions mount that fresh unprocessed tomatoes aren't necessarily
causing the salmonellosis outbreak that has sickened hundreds across
the USA. Robert Tauxe with the CDC says that 3 weeks after the FDA
(US Food and Drug Administration) warned consumers to avoid certain
types of tomatoes linked to the outbreak, people are still falling
ill.

The CDC launched a new round of interviews over the weekend [28-29
Jun 2008]. "We're broadening the investigation to be sure it
encompasses food items that are commonly consumed with tomatoes,"
Tauxe says.

If another food is found to be the culprit after tomatoes were
recalled nationwide and the produce industry sustained losses of
hundreds of millions of dollars, food safety experts say the public's
trust in the government's ability to track foodborne illnesses will
be shattered.

"It's going to fundamentally rewrite how we do outbreak
investigations in this country," says Michael Osterholm of the
National Center for Food Protection and Defense at the University of
Minnesota. "We can't let this investigation, however it might turn
out, end with just the answer of 'What caused it?' We need to take a
very in-depth look at foodborne disease investigation as we do it
today."

At a news conference Friday [27 Jun 2008], representatives of the FDA
(US Food and Drug Administration) and the CDC were more forceful in
saying that they aren't sure tainted tomatoes caused the outbreak of
_Salmonella_, a fairly rare strain. Previous statements had been more
vague.

Over the weekend, the tide of opinion among epidemiologists, produce
companies and food safety officials also began to turn in that
direction. Tomatoes couldn't have caused an outbreak that has
stretched from early April to late June [2008], says Jim Prevor,
editor of Produce Business magazine. "There's not a field in the
world" that produces that long, he says.

If not tomatoes, what else? "Something that people find difficult to
remember but which is always served with tomatoes," says Tauxe. That
would put salsa, jalapeno peppers, green onions and cilantro at the
top of the list of potential culprits, says Doug Powell, director of
the International Food Safety Network at Kansas State University in
Manhattan, Kansas.

Food safety experts caution that outbreaks are very difficult to
trace back to their source, especially tomatoes, which are often
mixed and matched at the packing plant to get uniform sizes and
ripeness.
