The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) said on Friday that 15
herdmates of Canada's latest mad cow case were exported to the United States.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has located one of the 15 animals
in Washington State and continues to trace the others, agency
spokesman Ed Loyd said.
"We have just under 150 animals that we are tracing ... and 23 were
located in Canada and quarantined," said Dr. George Luterbach, senior
veterinarian with the CFIA.
The 23 cattle quarantined in Canada, as well as the one located in
Washington, will soon be euthanized and tested for bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, also known as BSE or mad cow disease.
The animals may have been exposed to the same feed as the 6-year-old
dairy cow from a farm in the western province of British Columbia
that tested positive for the brain-wasting disease.
BSE is believed to be spread by feed containing rendered protein from
infected cattle or other ruminants.
"I would stress that even during the highest levels of infectivity of
BSE in the European situation, there was rarely more than one animal
in the herd that would become infected and express the disease," the
USDA's Loyd said.
"I would think the likelihood of any additional exposure would be
extremely remote in the United States."
The Canadian agency's investigation focuses primarily on the cow's
birth farm, which is close to the one it was found on, Luterbach said.
The CFIA continues to trace the remaining cohorts, cattle born on the
same farm 12 months before or after the affected animal. Luterbach
said the agency does not expect to find them all, as many would have
been killed for a variety of reasons.
"It's not likely any of these would have entered into the human food
chain as there are a number of measures that are taken," Luterbach said.
The pure-bred Holstein cow was confirmed to have the disease on 16
Apr 2006, making it Canada's 5th native-born mad cow case. The CFIA
said then that it did not enter the food supply.
The animal was born after the 1997 ban that prohibited adding protein
from cows and other ruminants, such as goats and sheep, to cattle feed.
This is not the first time that mad cow cohorts have been exported to
the U.S. This also occurred in 2003 and 2005, the CFIA said in a release.
The agency said it is "unlikely" to find additional BSE cases in the
feed cohort.
The CFIA has located the cow's 2004 calf, which had been slaughtered,
but continues to search for its 2005 calf, as it is believed possible
for BSE to be passed to offspring. The cow was pregnant at the time
of her death, Luterbach said.
The Canadian cattle industry suffered in 2003, when the U.S. banned
imports of live cattle after the first native-born case was
confirmed. The importation of cattle under 30 months old resumed in 2005.

[Whenever an animal is diagnosed with BSE and then found to have been
born after the ban on feeding ruminant material to ruminants, there
are questions and concerns. Where along the chain was the feed
contaminated, or is this a sporadic case? There are never any easy
answers - Mod.TG]
