Banana bunchy top nanavirus - New Caledonia 20010510.0904

In a previous post on 7 May 2001, I identified banana bunchy top virus as a
nanavirus. I have been advised by Michael Mayo and also by Ed Rybicki that
the ICTV-approved name of the genus is "Nanovirus." The same genus is also
referred to as "Nanavirus" virus in the VIDE database, which was my source
of the genus name. The definitive reference is the 7th ICTV Report (van
Regenmortel et al, 2000).
There are 5 members of the Nanovirus genus: Subterranean clover stunt,
Banana bunchy top, Coconut foliar decay, Faba bean necrotic yellows, and
Milk vetch dwarf. Nanoviruses have small, icosahedral virions, 17-22 nm
diameter, containing small, circular ssDNA genomes of about 1 kb in length.
