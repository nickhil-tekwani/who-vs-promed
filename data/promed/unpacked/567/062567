Dr. Walter Cottrell, Pennsylvania Game Commission wildlife veterinarian,
Monday [17 Jul 2006] confirmed that laboratory results conducted on a bobcat
killed by an off-duty police officer revealed that the animal was suffering
from rabies when it attacked and bit a bicyclist on a well-known cycling trail
near Williamsburg, Blair County on 13 Jul 2006.
The bobcat's carcass was transported by Game Commission Southcentral
Region Wildlife Management Supervisor Justin Vreeland to Penn State
University's Animal Diagnostics Lab, where Dr. Cottrell's office is
located. Dr. Cottrell conducted a necropsy and removed the animal's
brain for testing at the state Department of Health's Bureau of
Laboratories in Lionville, Chester County.
The bicyclist, traveling on the "Lower Trail," was about 4 miles from the town
of Williamsburg when he stopped to rest at a park bench along the trail. Game
Commission Southcentral Region Information and Education Supervisor Don Garner
said the bicyclist heard rustling in the weeds and spotted the bobcat, which
he first thought was a housecat. [It then came out and bit him on the arm.] As
a precaution, the cyclist began a series of rabies post-exposure vaccinations
the night he was attacked.
Dr. Cottrell said rabies can be carried by any mammal, especially bats,
raccoons and foxes. However, it is rare in large carnivores; prior to this
case, there were [only] 8 bobcats confirmed to have rabies in Pennsylvania;
one each in 1987, 1990, 1992, 1994, 1997, 2003, 2004 and 2005.
"There is a reservoir of the rabies virus in wildlife species," Dr.
Cottrell said. "It is a disease to be aware of, yet not paranoid
about. It is relatively rare, but will likely always be a part of the
world of wildlife. Animals who behave abnormally are automatically
suspect for rabies; the abnormal is normal for rabid mammals. There
is no reason not to enjoy the 'Lower Trail' or anywhere else in
Penn's Woods for that matter, due to this one incident. If there is
one species of animal in our state that does not desire human
contact, it is a bobcat. Most people living in bobcat habitat will
never see one."
The last human rabies fatality in Pennsylvania was a 12-year-old
Lycoming County boy who died in 1984, after being exposed to the bat
strain of the rabies virus.

A useful summary of wildlife rabies surveillance is the recent JAVMA
article: Rabies surveillance in the United States during 2004 by John
W. Krebs, MS; Eric J. Mandel, MS; David L. Swerdlow, MD; Charles E.
Rupprecht, VMD, PhD JAVMA 227(12):1912-1925 (2005) -- abstract online at
PubMed.
According to a graph of cases per year from 1955 to 2004, wildlife
rabies has become a major problem in animals. Raccoons, skunks,
foxes, and bats are the most commonly affected animals. There were
2564 raccoons (37.5 percent), 1856 skunks (27.1 percent), 1361 bats
(19.9 percent), 389 foxes (5.7 percent), 281 cats (4.1 percent), 115
cattle (1.7 percent), and 94 dogs (1.4 percent). However, bobcats
are not unheard of, accounting for 21 of the 90 reported cases of
rabies in the "other wild" category. Pennsylvania had 370 of the 6292
cases reported in wildlife in 2004 in the United States. There were 8
human cases cited in this report.
It is important to remember that the number of cases reported is
affected by many factors including the number of rabid animals in the
wild and the quality of surveillance and testing systems in a given
locality. It certainly seems to have worked out well in this
instance. - Mod.PC]
