Disease Outbreaks Reported, 25 Feb 2000
Imported yellow fever case in the Netherlands
----------------------------------------------
An imported yellow fever case has been reported by the national health
authorities in a 32-year-old unvaccinated male who went on a 4-week holiday
to Suriname. He became ill on 12 Jan 2000 after his return to the
Netherlands on 9 Jan 2000. He was admitted to hospital in The Hague where
he recovered and was recently discharged. Yellow fever was diagnosed by
serologic testing on 16 February.

[This answers our question as to whether this very fortunate patient had
been vaccinated; he had not. We await further information from The
Netherlands as to exactly how the diagnosis was made. If we can read
between the lines, it appears that a single serum sample was tested and the
diagnosis made on the basis of results of those tests. This would provide
a presumptive diagnosis only, not a confirmed diagnosis. More than a month
of opportunities to collect an early convalescent-phase sample might have
been lost. - Mod.CHC

Subject: No yellow fever diagnosis at WHO reference lab Rotterdam
It was recently reported that a Dutch traveler to Surinam was diagnosed
with yellow fever by the WHO reference laboratory in Rotterdam, The
Netherlands. This is incorrect. Although the laboratory found IgM and IgG
antibodies to yellow fever virus, high IgM and IgG serum antibody levels to
dengue virus[es also were found. This is in contrast to what was reported
by others. At this moment, it can not be concluded that the patient had
suffered from yellow fever. ProMED-mail will be updated when further data
become available.

[Hurrah! A number of valuable lessons can be learned from this series of
reports. (1) Always be suspicious of reports that do not include complete
data. (2) Never accept as a diagnosis one made from results of testing a
single serum sample. (3) Better to get reports from "the horse's mouth".
As mentioned in a footnoted comment to cross-reactivity: comment>, posted earlier today, "when a patient has had
an infection with one of the dengue viruses, then that patient's serum
might react strongly with yellow fever antigen by IgG ELISA. When the
patient has had yellow fever virus infection then that patient's serum will
not react at all, or to very low titer, with antigens of any of the dengue
viruses." This is much more so the case when IgM ELISA (MACELISA) is used,
i.e., MACELISA is even more specific than is IgG ELISA, that is one reason
it is such a useful test.
This case now sounds as though it might be a dengue virus infection. We
await additional results from Drs. Osterhaus, and Fouchier and, meanwhile,
thank them very much for providing this clarifying information.
I assume that the next time this patient goes to a possible YF-enzootic
area that he will get vaccinated against YF virus. No point in playing
"tropical disease roulette". - Mod.CHC
