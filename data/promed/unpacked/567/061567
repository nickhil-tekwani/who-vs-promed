Outbreak of RR virus disease in south-western Australia.
An acute outbreak of the mosquito-borne Ross River (RR) virus is currently
in progress in coastal regions of the south-west of Western Australia (WA).
Over 370 serologically confirmed cases had been reported or diagnosed by the
22nd of February 1996. The first cases were reported with dates of onset as
early as October 1995, but a few cases occur at that time every year.
Fourteen cases were reported with dates of onset in November, followed by 61
in December, 256 in January and 17 (to date) in February 1996. The worst
affected areas include the coastal towns of Australind, Bunbury, Capel and
Busselton, between 180 and 250km south of the WA capital, Perth. By January,
a considerable number of cases had also been reported from Perth, although
case follow-ups are likely to show that some of these infections were
acquired further south during the Christmas holidays.
Monitoring of adult mosquito populations provided fore-warning of the
outbreak when record numbers (>4000/EVS-CO2 trap/night) of Ae.
camptorhynchus mosquitoes were collected during November 1995. This
salt-marsh and brackish wetland species was implicated as the main vector of
RR virus in two previous outbreaks in the region. Media releases, warning of
the likelihood of increased activity of RR virus, were issued by the Health
Department of WA in October and December 1995. Fifteen isolates of RR virus
were obtained by our laboratory from collections of Ae. camptorhynchus
mosquitoes on 7/12/95 near Busselton. The persistence of record numbers of
this species into late November and December was probably due to unusually
heavy late spring and early summer rains combined with relatively mild daily
temperatures during that period. Further epidemiological, entomological,
virological and environmental data are currently being sought.

River virus epidemic fear,' Sydney Morning Herald, 04.03.96.

Queensland and northern NSW were experiencing a Ross River Virus (RRV)
outbreak in near epidemic proportions, the Queensland Medical Laboratory
said yesterday.
Its consultant microbiologist Dr David Drummond, said the Barmah Forest
Virus (BFV) which was spread by the sample types of mosquito as RRV, was
also on the increase. Record early summer rains which increased mosquito
breeding areas, had contributed to the RRV upsurge. "Major epidemics are
usually associated with excess rainfall and the presence of large amounts
of surface water," Dr Drummond said in a statement.
Most cases of RRV in previous years had been recorded between Brisbane and
the Sunshine Coast. "Now, however, there has been a marked increase around
Gladstone, Goondiwindi and northern inland NSW following widespread
flooding," he said. Significant numbers of cases were also being found in
the Ipswich and Brisbane River Valley areas. "In fact, virtually all areas
of south-east and central Queensland are recording increased cases,
suggesting a widespread epidemic,' Dr Drummond said.
BFV cases had risen steadily in the past few years peaking each summer. It
produced the same symptoms as RRV - arthritis, rash, tiredness and fever -
and its geographical distribution was similar to that of RRV, he said.
