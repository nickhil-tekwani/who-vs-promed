The map shows the 2 core areas (demarcated orange) which have become included in a common endangered area (violet). Around the endangered area, the affected districts have set up a buffer zone (green), in close cooperation with the state crisis center for animal disease control. The buffer zone is considered disease-free. For further details, including specific requirements for various sectors (such as hunters, pig farmers, the general public) in each of the 3 areas, please refer to the URL above. - Mod.AS
