Apparent Malaria Increase Imported from The Gambia
-------------------------------------------------------
Simultaneous with the start of the travel season to West Africa,
TropNetEurop [European Network on Imported Infectious Disease Surveillance
centres are reporting an increase in numbers of patients returning with
falciparum malaria from this area. Though total reported numbers do not
indicate anything alarming (yet), we were struck by the high percentage of
complicated cases among these patients. Below follows a series of case
reports chiefly concerning The Gambia that have come in since 15 Nov 2000.
[1
LONDON: In our clinical service we have 3 severe cases of falciparum
malaria contracted by short-term tourists visiting the Gambia, 2 of whom
are in intensive care. We have also 2 other reports of cases contracted in
the Gambia. We have as yet no details of itinerary or exposure other than
the fact that the 3 cases were NOT on regular chemoprophylaxis. I
understand there has been a lot of rain recently in the Gambia, making for
peak transmission. I interpret this as a significant increase in
transmission and risk for tourists to coastal Gambia, and would be
interested to hear if any other members of the TropNetEurop have seen
imported cases. I will provide more details on exposure if they become
available.

STOCKHOLM: I have just learned that we admitted a non-severe _P.
falciparum_ case to our clinic yesterday, a 44-year-old Swedish woman who
spent one week (25 Oct - 2 Nov 2000) in the Gambia at [named Hotel. She
went on a one-day excursion up the river Gambia but did not stay overnight.
She was on regular prophylaxis with proguanil 200 mg/day (other drugs
considered to be contraindicated for medical reasons) until she fell ill on
18 Nov 2000.

BARCELONA: We've received many _P.falciparum_ malaria cases from Senegal
this year, above all since September. Like in Germany, the promotional
tourism campaign with very cheap tickets seems to be the cause of the
increasing number of trips to this country. There are many tourists who
decide to buy tickets just a few days before the trip, and usually they
don't take any prophylaxis against malaria.

COPENHAGEN: We have one more patient to report, from Rigshospitalet,
Copenhagen: a 28-year-old female, who went to The Gambia 1-8 Nov 2000
unfortunately without chemoprophylaxis, since "it was only for a week." She
fell ill 16 Nov, was hospitalized 17 Nov, showing 1-2 % _P. falciparum_,
rising to >5% on 19 Nov. She was given i.v. quinine for 3 days, then
Malarone 4 tabs daily for 3 days, and is improving quickly. We have warned
her travel agency.

BERLIN: We see a sharp increase in (usually unprotected) nonimmune
travellers to The Gambia at our institution. Returning travellers who
visited relatives and friends report that, according to locals, there seem
to be significantly more, and more severe cases, among the adult local
population. It would be interesting to hear whether colleagues, e.g., those
working at the Medical Research Council (MRC) facilities, can confirm these
anecdotal reports.

MADRID: In our hospital 2 severe cases of _P.falciparum_ malaria have been
diagnosed very recently. Both were short-term travellers visiting The
Gambia NOT on chemoprophylaxis. Both were in intensive care, one with
respiratory distress and the other with coma. Fortunately both have recovered.

VIENNA: Herwig Kollaritsch has also reported a case of complicated malaria
in an Austrian returnee from The Gambia. The patient (female, 51, no
prophylaxis) went into septic shock and developed ARDS but fortunately
recovered. In Germany, we have seen an impressive increase of imported
falciparum malaria from the Gambia during the season 1999/2000. At that
time, the most likely explanation appeared to be a promotional campaign of
tourist resorts in that country by the travel industry. Tickets became very
cheap and many people booked without bothering to check where they were
actually flying. It appears that we will see another peak this winter.

[Malaria is common in The Gambia. While a series of isolated case reports
may act as a warning, it is difficult to know whether there is a real
increase in risk. This is because we do not know if the number of tourists
to The Gambia at this time of the year is higher compared to last year, or
whether the number of reported cases is, in fact, what can be expected.
However, there is a real possibility of increased transmission in the
tourist resort areas including the coastal areas, where the majority of the
hotels are located. In the current situation it is important to stress the
necessity of malaria prophylaxis to tourists traveling to The Gambia. It
would be interesting to hear from the Medical Research Council station in
Fajara if they have any data suggesting an increased transmission rate
compared to previous years. - Mod.EP
