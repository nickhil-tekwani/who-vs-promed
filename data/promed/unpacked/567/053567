Rabid skunks found in El Paso County
------------------------------------
Skunks infected with rabies have been found in El Paso County for the 1st
time in nearly 4 decades, according to the El Paso County Department of
Health and Environment. This finding serves as a reminder to the public
that pets and livestock must be properly vaccinated.

"Rabies in skunks has been identified in Colorado and now in El Paso
County," said Kandi Buckland, MPA, public health director at the Health
Department. "Now, more than ever, we urge pet and livestock owners to
ensure that their animals are vaccinated against rabies and for parents to
remind their children to avoid feeding, petting, or touching wildlife."

A total of 3 rabid skunks have been reported in northern El Paso County so
far this summer [2009]. The last time that a rabid skunk was found in El
Paso County was 1970. The Colorado Department of Public Health and
Environment has been monitoring the spread of skunk rabies in Colorado and
predicted last year [2008] that El Paso County would likely be affected
soon. Since 1 Jan 2009, 22 skunks infected with rabies have been reported
in Colorado; in 2008, 18 were reported.

Rabies is a viral disease in mammals -- including people. Rabies infects
the brain and other parts of the central nervous system, causing brain
swelling and damage, and ultimately, death. Rabies is spread primarily
through the bite of rabid animals, resulting in the spread of the disease
through their infected saliva. Rabies also can be spread when saliva from
an infected animal gets into open wounds, cuts, or enters through membranes
of the eyes, nose, or mouth.

No cure exists for rabies once symptoms appear. Preventive medication is
available for people known or suspected to have been bitten by a rabid
animal. It is critically important for people bitten or scratched by a wild
animal or an unfamiliar animal to contact their health care provider.

Rabies always is present in bats in Colorado. The finding of rabies in
skunks increases the possibility that rabies will spread to other wild
animals, including unvaccinated pets and livestock -- the animals that have
the most frequent contact with humans.

In addition to ensuring that pets and livestock are vaccinated properly
against rabies, Buckland recommends these prevention steps
- don't feed wild animals or allow your pets around them. Be sure to teach
children to stay away from wild mammals
- contact your veterinarian if your dog or cat is bitten or scratched by a
wild animal, such as skunks, bats, foxes, or raccoons
- if you suspect you've been exposed to rabies, contact your physician
without delay
- discuss rabies vaccination of your livestock with your veterinarian.
Vaccination should be considered for horses and other equines, breeding
livestock, dairy cattle, or other high-value livestock
- if you observe a wild mammal acting strangely, especially a skunk, or if
you find a dead skunk, stay away from it. Strange behavior for a skunk
would include being out and about during daytime hours
- if you find a dead skunk on your property, wear rubber gloves or lift the
carcass with a shovel or other tool, and double-bag it for the trash.

[Rabid skunks are problems for most communities in the United States.
Skunks can transmit the disease to other domestic animals, including horses
and cattle. Most horses and cattle are curious about the little creature in
their domain and poke their noses at these visitors, where they often get
bit on the nose, thus transmitting the virus. Although skunks are known for
their odors, they do not always spray when threatened if they are infected
by rabies. Consequently, dogs and cats can be and are bitten by these
creatures. It is important that owners of pets of various sizes in all
areas have their animals vaccinated as a preventative against this disease.
