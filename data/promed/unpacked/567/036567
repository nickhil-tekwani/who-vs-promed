Syphilis fuelled by iPhone applications such as Grindr have "come back with a vengeance" among Christchurch's young homosexual community. Sexual health physicians say the Government needs to take immediate action before the infection spreads into the heterosexual community, where it has the potential to claim the lives of unborn children.

Christchurch fielded a fourfold increase in infectious syphilis from 2011 to last year [2012] and so far this year 16 people have been treated for syphilis at the city's Sexual Health Centre -- with 6 of those infectious.

"If there is no specific action taken, it [syphilis] has the potential for rapid spread and I fear we will be just sitting here watching a train wreck," [Canterbury District Health Board Sexual Health Centre physician Dr Heather] Young said. Because government funding does not cover most sexually transmitted infections (STI), treatment rests with regional health boards.

Syphilis has been on the increase in New Zealand since 2003, with a rise of more than 193 per cent of cases between 2004 and 2006. Rates peaked in Christchurch last year, Young said. Not only did the number of cases leap from 7 in 2011 to 28 last year, but the average age and way that men were contracting the infection also changed dramatically. Most men who caught syphilis in 2011 were in their mid-40s and contracted the disease at sex-on-site venues, such as brothels. However, last year the median age dropped to 26, with some sufferers as young as 19. It was most commonly caught after the use of social media or iPhone applications such as Grindr, Boy Ahoy and NZ Dating, Young said.

"The highest number of people contracting infectious syphilis is men having sex with men and many are using social media sites or smartphones to search for sexual partners." The applications enabled men to meet "anywhere safe and convenient" for casual sex. Young knew some patients who used Grindr and had had more than 50 sexual partners in 3 months. Others did not even know the name of their last partner. It wasn't until a patient showed Young how the application worked that she realised "the ease of sexual partner acquisition. I didn't truly understand it until I saw it. About 50 people popped up in the immediate vicinity with directions on how to access them," she said. "People can access sexual partners with the greatest freedom they have ever had now."

One of the big concerns was syphilis' potential to spread into the heterosexual community where it can be transferred from mother to baby during pregnancy. Congenital syphilis could result in miscarriages, stillbirths and abnormalities in babies, she said. Many other developed countries are also experiencing a rise of syphilis cases, but have already introduced measures to halt its spread. "Syphilis should be a top priority [for the Government] because it's got serious consequences," Young said.

Dr Ed Coughlan, clinical director of the Sexual Health Centre, said the issue was "very concerning." Coughlan urged the community to have regular sexual health checkups. Doctors around the city had been alerted and an advertising campaign was being published on Facebook and in homosexual magazines, he said.

Coughlan and Christchurch medical officer of health Dr Ramon Pink have also written a joint report to the Ministry of Health, urging the Government to initiate a national response with Pink calling for a "nationally co-ordinated approach." "We have texting, Facebook and Twitter and many ways in which we as a society are more connected but it is very important for us to realise that despite our advances in technology, these diseases are still prevalent in our community and they do pose a risk," he said. "Pockets" of the outbreak had flared up in Christchurch, Wellington, and Auckland and Pink said if nothing was done to contain the infection it would only be a matter of time before it went national.

The Government has identified sexual health as a "key work area" in its 2010-2013 Statement of Intent. Ministry of Health chief medical officer Dr Don Mackie said the Government invested about NZD 55 million [USD 45 204 500] in sexual and reproduction health services through ministry contracts and district health board provider agreements every year.

[The increase in the rate of primary and secondary (infectious) syphilis in New Zealand, mainly among men who have sex with men (MSM), has been seen elsewhere.

In the USA, in the 1980's, as the rate of primary and secondary (infectious) syphilis decreased among homosexual and bisexual males, largely because of changes in sexual behavior due to the AIDS epidemic, a spike in the rate of infectious syphilis occurred among heterosexual men, women, and neonates (congenital syphilis) in the late 1980s that was attributed to epidemic of crack cocaine use and exchange of sex for drugs. Cases of syphilis again dropped from 1990 to 2000. In 2000, the rate of primary and secondary syphilis in the United States was 2.1 cases per 100 000 population, the lowest since reporting began in 1941. From 2001 to 2004, the primary and secondary syphilis rate increased nationally to 2.7, primarily as a result of increases in cases among MSM.

Similarly, infectious syphilis in Australia has been attributed mainly to sex between men (http://www.med.unsw.edu.au/NCHECRweb.nsf/resources/2011/$file/KIRBY_ASR2011.pdf). In Canada, the rate of infectious syphilis has been increasing since 2000, predominantly among men (http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/std-mts/report/sti-its2008/05-eng.php). In 2008, men accounted for 86.1 percent of reported cases in Canada.

Reported increases in the incidence of infectious syphilis among MSM have been attributed in part to "HIV prevention fatigue," which appears to limit effective condom use and to result in high-risk sexual behavior associated with use of drugs such as methamphetamines or the use of the Internet chat rooms (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5510a1.htm), which can lead to unsafe sex with multiple casual partners, and consequently high rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection.

Ulcerative sexually transmitted infections such as syphilis increase acquisition of HIV infection sexually. There is an estimated 2- to 5-fold increased risk of acquiring HIV if exposed to that infection when syphilis is present (http://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/stdfact-syphilis.htm).

The Canterbury region of New Zealand is located on the South Island; Christchurch is the largest city in the South Island, with a population of around 300 000.
