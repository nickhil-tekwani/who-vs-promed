Tick fever outbreak claims 18 head of cattle amid calls for better management of Queensland's tick line.

Cattle producers are calling for better co-ordination and more inspectors in the wake of a cattle fever outbreak in a supposedly 'tick free' zone
that's raised questions about recent tick management changes.

[Tick fever is a cattle disease caused by any one of the following blood parasites:
- _Babesia bovis_
- _Babesia bigemina_
- _Anaplasma marginale_

These parasites are all transmitted by the cattle tick (_Boophilus microplus_). Disease caused by _Babesia bovis_ or _B. bigemina_ is called babesiosis, often referred to as 'red water'. Disease caused by _Anaplasma marginale_ is called anaplasmosis.

_B. bovis_ is the most important parasite, causing more than 80 percent of outbreaks of tick fever in Queensland each year.

Clinical signs of tick fever include weakness, depression, and loss of appetite. These signs are mainly due to the associated fever and red blood cell destruction (causing anaemia).

Despite the common name 'red water', red urine is only occasionally present and late in the course of the disease. Other clinical signs may include jaundice and neurological signs.

Cattle with _B. bovis_ infections may be quite sick even in the absence of anaemia and red urine.

It is difficult to diagnose tick fever based on clinical signs alone. The best way to diagnose tick fever is to send blood smears to a laboratory for examination.

Risk factors for tick fever:
- Breed. British, European, and other _Bos taurus_ cattle breeds are more susceptible to tick fever caused by _Babesia_ organisms than Brahman and _Bos indicus_ breeds. Cross breeds (_B. taurus_ x _B. indicus_) have intermediate susceptibility determined by the percentage of each breed type. All breeds, including _B. indicus_ breeds, are highly susceptible to disease caused by _A. marginale_.
- Age. There is a strong link between age and resistance. Most outbreaks occur in animals 18 to 36 months of age. Calves exposed to tick fever organisms between 3 to 9 months of age rarely show clinical signs and develop a solid, long-lasting immunity.
- Exposure. Cattle born and raised in areas where cattle ticks are endemic can develop natural immunity through exposure to ticks infected with tick fever. However, exposure of calves to ticks infected with tick fever (and subsequent development of protective immunity) can be highly unpredictable. Exposure is influenced by factors such as breed, season, and tick-control strategies.

All cattle raised in areas free from cattle ticks are at risk of tick fever if introduced into areas where ticks are present.
