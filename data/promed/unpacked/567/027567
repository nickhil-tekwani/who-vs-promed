[1] North Korea: suspected, border town lockdown
Date: Sat 25 Jul 2020 13:58 EDT

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un declared an emergency and a lockdown in a border town after a person suspected of being infected with the novel coronavirus returned from South Korea after illegally crossing the border, state media said on Sunday [26 Jul 2020]. If confirmed, it would be the 1st case officially acknowledged by North Korean authorities.

Kim convened an emergency politburo meeting in response to what he called a "critical situation in which the vicious virus could be said to have entered the country", the North's KCNA state news reported. A person who defected to South Korea 3 years ago returned across the fortified border that divides the 2 Koreas to the town of Kaesong this month [July 2020] with symptoms of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, KCNA reported.

"An emergency event happened in Kaesong City where a runaway who went to the south 3 years ago, a person who is suspected to have been infected with the vicious virus returned on [19 Jul 2020] after illegally crossing the demarcation line," KCNA said.

KCNA did not say if the person had been tested, but said an "uncertain result was made from several medical check-ups of the secretion of that person's upper respiratory organ and blood", prompting officials to quarantine the person and investigate anyone he may have been in contact with.

One analyst said the announcement was important, not only because North Korea was for the 1st time reporting a suspected coronavirus case but also because it suggested it was appealing for help. "It's an ice-breaking moment for North Korea to admit a case," said Choo Jae-woo, a professor at Kyung Hee University. "It could be reaching out to the world for help. Perhaps for humanitarian assistance."

"North Korea is in such a dire situation, where they can't even finish building the Pyongyang General Hospital on time. Pointing the blame at an 'imported case' from South Korea, the North can use this as a way to openly accept aid from the South," Cho said.

The South's Joint Chiefs of Staffs (JCS) said there was a "high chance" that someone had indeed crossed and the military was checking surveillance footage. It even suggested it might be able to identify the person. "Our military has specified some people and is verifying facts in close collaboration with related agencies," the JCS said.

North Korea has received thousands of coronavirus testing kits from Russia and other countries and imposed strict border closures. Thousands of people in North Korea were also quarantined as it took precautions to prevent a coronavirus outbreak but restrictions had recently been eased.

[There were rumors several months ago that North Korea had been seriously impacted by COVID-19, but the rumors were never substantiated. The announcement of a suspected cases is highly significant, given the total silence from the country. Given the ongoing transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 in South Korea, it is possible this will be a confirmed case, or a probable case if there are testing challenges. If the case had already been confirmed by South Korea, information should be available through their tracing systems. - Mod.MPP

[2] Serology challenges
Date: Sun 26 Jul 2020
Source: The New York Times [abridged, edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/26/health/coronvirus-antibody-tests.html


Declining antibody levels do not mean less immunity, experts say. Besides, 2 widely used tests may detect the wrong antibodies. Your blood carries the memory of every pathogen you've ever encountered. If you've been infected with the coronavirus, your body most likely remembers that, too. Antibodies are the legacy of that encounter. Why, then, have so many people stricken by the virus discovered that they don't seem to have antibodies?

Blame the tests. Most commercial antibody tests offer crude yes-no answers. The tests are notorious for delivering false positives -- results indicating that someone has antibodies when he or she does not. But the volume of coronavirus antibodies drops sharply once the acute illness ends. Now it is increasingly clear that these tests may also produce false-negative results, missing antibodies to the coronavirus that are present at low levels.

Moreover, some tests -- including those made by Abbott and Roche and offered by Quest Labs and LabCorp [in the USA] -- are designed to detect a subtype of antibodies that doesn't confer immunity and may wane even faster than the kind that can destroy the virus. What that means is that declining antibodies, as shown by commercial tests, don't necessarily mean declining immunity, several experts said. Long-term surveys of antibodies, intended to assess how widely the coronavirus has spread, may also underestimate the true prevalence.

"We're learning a lot about how antibodies change over time," said Dr Fiona Havers, a medical epidemiologist who has led such surveys for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. If the narrative on immunity to the coronavirus has seemed to shift constantly, it's in part because the virus was a stranger to scientists. But it's increasingly clear that this virus behaves much like any other.

This is how immunity to viruses generally works: The initial encounter with a pathogen -- typically in childhood -- surprises the body. The resulting illness can be mild or severe, depending on the dose of the virus and the child's health, access to health care, and genetics.

A mild illness may trigger production of only a few antibodies, and a severe one many more. The vast majority of people who become infected with the coronavirus have few to no symptoms, and those people may produce a milder immune response than those who become severely ill, Dr Havers said. But even a minor infection is often enough to teach the body to recognize the intruder.

After the battle ends, balloon-like cells that live in the bone marrow steadily pump out a small number of specialized assassins. The next time -- and every time after that -- that the body comes across the virus, those cells can mass-produce antibodies within hours.

The mnemonic response grows stronger with every encounter. "Whatever your level is today, if you get infected, your antibody titers are going to go way up," said Dr Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University, referring to the levels of antibodies in the blood. "The virus will never even have a chance the 2nd time around." A single drop of blood contains billions of antibodies, all lying in wait for their specific targets. Sometimes, as may be the case for antibodies to the coronavirus, there are too few to get a positive signal on a test -- but that does not mean the person tested has no immunity to the virus. "Even if their antibodies wane below the limits of detection of our instruments, it doesn't mean their 'memory' is gone," Dr Mina said.

A small number of people may not produce any antibodies to the coronavirus. But even in that unlikely event, they will have so-called cellular immunity, which includes T cells that learn to identify and destroy the virus [known as cell-mediated immunity]. Virtually everyone infected with the coronavirus seems to develop T-cell responses, according to several recent studies.

"This means that even if the antibody titer is low, those people who are previously infected may have a good enough T-cell response that can provide protection," said Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University. T cells are harder to detect and to study, however, so when it comes to immunity, antibodies have received all of the attention. The coronavirus carries several antigens -- proteins or pieces of a protein -- that can provoke the body into producing antibodies.

The most powerful antibodies recognize a piece of the coronavirus's spike protein, the receptor binding domain, or RBD. That is the part of the virus that docks onto human cells. Only antibodies that recognize the RBD can neutralize the virus and prevent infection. But the Roche and Abbott tests that are now widely available -- and several others authorized by the Food and Drug Administration -- instead look for antibodies to a protein called the nucleocapsid, or N, that is bound up with the virus's genetic material.

Some scientists were stunned to hear of this choice. "God, I did not realize that -- that's crazy," said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University in New York. "It's kind of puzzling to design a test that's not looking for what's thought to be the major antigen."

The N protein is plentiful in the blood, and testing for antibodies to it produces a swifter, brighter signal than testing for antibodies to the spike protein. Because antibody tests are used to detect past infection, however, manufacturers are not required to prove that the antibodies their tests seek are those that actually confer protection against the virus. There's another wrinkle to the story. Some reports now suggest that antibodies to the viral nucleocapsid may decline faster than those to RBD or to the entire spike -- the really effective ones. "The majority of people are getting tested for anti-N antibody, which does tend to wane more rapidly -- and so, you know, it may be not the most suitable test for looking at neutralizing capacity," Dr Iwasaki said.

[A] physician in Boston, tested positive for the virus in early April 2020 but felt fine, apart from a sore throat. His wife was sicker, and despite several negative diagnostic tests, she remained ill for weeks. "Initially, we felt as a family that, 'Oh wow, we got sick, unfortunately,'" he said. "But the good side of that is that we're going to have immunity.'" In early June [2020], the couple and their 2 children took antibody tests. All 4 turned up negative.

Dr Beatus Ofenloch-Haehnle, who heads immunoassay research at Roche, defended the company's antibody test. His team has tracked N antibodies in 130 people who had mild to no symptoms and has not yet seen a decline, he said. "There is some fluctuation, but no waning at all," he said. "We have a lot of data, and we do not rely anymore on theory." The N antibody can be a decent proxy for immunity, Dr Ofenloch-Haehnle added. He also pointed to a study by Public Health England that suggested that the Abbott and Roche tests seemed to perform well up to 73 days after symptom onset. "I think we should be careful to jump to conclusions too soon," he said.

There is no definitive information as yet on what levels of antibodies are needed for immunity or how long that protection might last. "I think we're getting closer and closer to that knowledge," Dr Iwasaki said.

[The plot thickens on the serology tests used in the USA and elsewhere. The existence of an anamnestic response (rapid production of high levels of antibodies) following exposure to the antigen (SARS-CoV-2), has been observed with other viruses with apparent waning immunity. But has that been proven with respect to the protective antibodies to the spike protein?

Given the noted challenges of accuracy of the various serologic tests available (sensitivity -- true positives -- and specificity -- true negatives), the USA FDA (Food and Drug Administration) is currently performing independent evaluations of the currently available serologic tests (https://open.fda.gov/apis/device/covid19serology/). Likewise, the COVID-19 testing project based out of UCSF (University of California, San Francisco) UC Berkeley, Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, and Innovative Genomics Institute (https://covidtestingproject.org/), and FIND (Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics, an NGO (non-governmental organization) based in Geneva (https://www.finddx.org/covid-19/sarscov2-eval-immuno/) have been doing independent evaluations of immunoassays available globally.

The general consensus of the reviews presently in the literature is that there is a pressing need to understand the value of the serology, both in terms of immediate diagnostic need (IgM when PCR tests came back negative in highly probable clinical cases) and later to look at population immunity and understand the significance of the results provided by the various types of tests available. The conclusion on the part of Duong YT, Wright CG, Justman J. (3) in their editorial accompanying Lisboa Bastos M, Tavaziva G, Abidi SK, et al. (2) says it all: "not ready for prime time."

[These countries had been selected based on having had significant surges with SARS-CoV-2 infections but different responses. In some cases, transmission was almost interrupted, but resurgences have occurred, and countries have handled them differently. One observation is that lifting of restrictions has led to major resurgences in some areas; in others, early new threats seem to be importations, but community spread does recur. Good contact tracing has helped to shorten the time with new clusters and temporary new restrictions have had an impact. Countries not implementing restrictions have done more poorly, with major resurgences. - Mod.MPP]

[Caution should be in place in drawing conclusions about relative standings as there is definitely weekend artifact with key countries not submitting reports to WHO on numbers of cases in the past 24 hours: In Europe, Spain, France, Sweden, Belarus; In the Americas, the USA; in Africa, Algeria, Cameroon.

The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:

- The Americas region reported 46.6% of the global newly reported cases and 59.9% of newly reported deaths for this 24-hour period, maintaining its dominance as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 8.3 million cases. The USA reported 0% of cases (0), Brazil 59.8% (55 891), Mexico 8.1% (7573), Colombia 7.7% (7168), Argentina 5.9% (5493), Peru 5.2% (4865), and Chile 2.4% (2288).

- The European region reported 10.1% of the global newly reported cases and 6.4% of the newly confirmed deaths globally. Russia reported 28.4% (5765) of the regional newly confirmed cases, followed by (Spain 0% (0)), Israel 8.7% (1764), Kyrgyzstan 7.7% (1566), Kazakhstan 7.4% (1494), Romania 6.3% (1284), Turkey 4.5% (921), Ukraine 4.5% (920), (France 0% (0)), and the UK 3.8% (767). Italy 1.3% (274), has increased its 7-day average by 22.7% over the preceding 7-day period, a sign there are increases in transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 (calculated from the daily spreadsheet we maintain with data from http://www.salute.gov.it/portale/nuovocoronavirus/dettaglioContenutiNuovoCoronavirus.jsp?lingua=italiano&id=5351&area=nuovoCoronavirus&menu=vuoto).

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 6.8% of the global newly reported cases and 9.0% of global newly reported fatalities. Iraq reported 21.0% (2862), of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Iran 17.0% (2316), Saudi Arabia 16.2% (2201), Pakistan 9.0% (1226), Oman 7.8% (1067), Morocco 6.0% (811), Kuwait 5.0% (684), Egypt 3.8% (511), Qatar 2.9 (398), and Palestinian Authority 2.8% (383). Pakistan is decreasing its daily case count steadily during the month of July 2020, while at the same time cases are increasing in Iraq and Oman. This region remains highly active, with multiple countries still in a surge mode.

- The African region reported 8.1% of the global newly reported cases and 7.6% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 75.1% (12 204) of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Ghana 4.9% (794), Ethiopia 3.4% (555), Zambia 2.9% (475), (Algeria 0% (0)), Nigeria 2.7% (438), and Kenya 2.3% (375). Since the beginning of July 2020, South Africa has reported daily new case counts of greater than 10 000, 17 of the 26 days.

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.9% of the global newly reported cases and 0.60% of global deaths. The Philippines reported 52.8% (1968) of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Japan 16.0% (596), Singapore 13.8% (513), Australia 9.5% (355), China 4.8% (179), and South Korea 1.6% (58).

- The South East Asia region reported 26.5% of the global newly reported cases and 16.4% of global deaths. India reported 91.4% (48 661) of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 4.7% (2520) and Indonesia 3.5% (1868). India continues to be the driving force of the dominance of this region.

Impression: The overall picture is basically the same. The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed cases on a daily basis followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, followed by the Africa region and the Western Pacific region representing the lowest daily caseload of all the regions.

[A similar note of caution in interpreting today's data as there is weekend reporting artifact. No newly confirmed cases were reported by Spain, France, Sweden, or Peru, all countries known to have high levels of ongoing transmission of the SARS-CoV-2. Similarly, Brazil and the USA daily counts have markedly decreased over the weekend with significant drops in reports from Florida and California in the USA, both states with known high levels of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2. Brazil has a reporting pattern with significant drops in reported cases every weekend (see epidemic curve at https://covid.saude.gov.br/).

Comparing today's numbers with yesterday's (25 Jul 2020), the global case count rose by 1.3% in the past 24 hours. The USA and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts, although India has been rapidly increasing, with daily case counts around 50 000.

In the past 24 hours, the USA reported 56 130 cases, followed by India (50 525), and Brazil (23 467). These 3 countries account for half of all confirmed cases globally (50.1%). There were 3640 deaths reported in the past 24 hours.

In descending rank order, the USA is number one for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by India, Brazil, South Africa, Colombia, Russia, Mexico, Argentina, Iraq, Iran, and Bangladesh, all known global hotspots. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed cases goes from 2275 to 56 130. Other hotspots are seen in the countries numbered 12-20 in this list: Chile, Philippines, Dominican Republic, Saudi Arabia, Kazakhstan, Indonesia, Panama, Israel, and Venezuela; their range of reported new cases is 1200 to 2198.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase of 11.9%, and looking at daily reported deaths, the change is increased by 18.4%.

Impression: The SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts (10.4%) and mortality (15.6%). That being said, the most severely affected region is still the Americas with cases increasing on a daily basis, even though the comparative 7-day average suggests things may be slowing down (or reporting is slowing down). - Mod.MPP]
