A 2-year-old boy died in Taiwan last week [15 Jan 2015] of the H3N2 flu, which killed more than 30 people in Hong Kong this month [January 2015], the authorities said [Fri 23 Jan 2015]. The boy, who had been vaccinated against the flu, nevertheless still succumbed to what might have been the 2nd deadly case of an H3N2 virus, according to the [Taiwan] Centers for Disease Control. The previous victim was a man older than 90, with neither case being protected by the vaccines because they [were infected with a mutated strain] of H3N2, the [Taiwan] CDC said. The same virus killed 21 adults in Hong Kong within just 1 week, reports said.

Tests at laboratories showed that 27 percent of H3N2 cases belonged to the new type, which could lead to serious complications if the patient failed to seek medical care in time, the [Taiwan] CDC said. In Hong Kong, the proportion was reportedly as high as 70 percent, making effective treatment even more difficult. According to experts, the H3N2 flu was the type most likely to convert itself into new forms in order to escape treatment. Over the past few decades, various types, named as the Fujian and the Sydney flu, had appeared and evolved to create relatively high fatality counts, physicians said.

In the future, H3N2 could only grow stronger and more dangerous, causing more deaths than previous types, according to experts. Children would be the most susceptible victims because of their low resistance and because they would not be protected by vaccinations in the case of new flu types. The boy who died last week had been vaccinated last November [2014] but showed signs of fever and coughing on 9 Jan 2015, the [Taiwan] CDC said. After 3 visits to a clinic, he began to suffer severe breathing problems, which led his parents to take him to another medical center on 13 Jan 2015. The boy died at the intensive care ward of a hospital on 15 Jan 2015, within the space of one week after the signs of the flu emerged.

[This death was reported by Taiwan on Fri 23 Jan 2015. It occurred at the same time as Taiwan is suffering from its most severe [H5] avian influenza outbreak in over the past decade. Over 2300 people employed at poultry farms across 9 counties are being monitored. Over 400 000 poultry have been culled since the H5 [not H3] strain of avian flu struck 2 weeks ago (http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/video/2015-01/25/c_133945147.htm).

The mutation in H3N2 referred to in this report was discussed on 8 Dec 2014 in a report from The Pulse (http://wyomingmedicalcenter.org/pulse/2014/12/08/dr-mark-dowell-urges-flu-shots-despite-mutated-h3n2-strain/): Dr Mark Dowell urges flu shots despite mutated H3N2 strain (byline: Kristy Bleizeffer):

"Last week [week of 1 Dec 2014], the [US] Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced the 2014-2015 flu vaccine is not as protective as hoped for the seasonal influenza A H3N2 virus, a strain found to be most common so far this year. About half of the H3N2 viruses tested are "drift variants," meaning they've mutated to a form not protected by the vaccine, the [US] CDC said."

Typically, the flu vaccine is about 70 percent protective in the typical adult population. In older adults -- those 65 and older -- the vaccine is 40 to 50 percent protective. "But this year [2014-15], across the board, the vaccine is probably around 50 percent protective. It could not have been predicted. The virus played its own game and changed a little. This is our battle against nature every year," Dowell said.

The unfortunate death of the child in Taiwan [from the H3 virus] was most likely the consequence of lack of protection from the vaccine and unrelated to the severe avian flu [H5 virus] outbreak.

Influenza viruses that normally circulate in pigs are called "variant" viruses when they are found in people. Influenza A H3N2 variant viruses (also known as "H3N2v" viruses) infections have mostly been associated with prolonged exposure to pigs at agricultural fairs. Limited human-to-human spread of this virus has been detected in the past but no sustained or community spread of H3N2v has been identified. It's possible that sporadic infections and even localized outbreaks among people with this virus will continue to occur (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/h3n2v-cases.htm). - Mod.LK
