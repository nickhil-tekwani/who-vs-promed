South Korea has identified a case of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] at a dairy cow farm, the 1st discovery of the disease in the country since March last year [2018], its agriculture ministry said on [Mon 28 Jan 2019].

The outbreak occurred at the farm of 120 cows in Anseong city, southeast of Seoul [Gyeonggi-do province], the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs said in a statement.

The ministry said it will cull the cows at the affected farm and step up quarantine and disinfection measures including a temporary transport ban on livestock to contain the wider spread of the virus.

The most recent case was reported last March [2018] when the outbreak was discovered at a hog farm.

[South Korea's previous FMD outbreak, in March 2018, took place in the same province (Gyeonggi-do). It involved domestic pigs infected by FMD virus strain serotype A, topotype Asia, lineage SEA-97. Its genotyping results, as well as of other strains (serotypes A and O) from South Korea since 2014 (when South Korea suffered a widespread outbreak), are available on the World Reference Laboratory for FMD website at http://www.wrlfmd.org/east-and-southeast-asia/south-korea#panel-3422.

The FMD vaccine-matching strain differentiation report, dated 15 Jun 2018, addressing strain A/SKR/5/2018 (pig, collected 7 Apr 2018) is available at http://www.wrlfmd.org/sites/world/files/WRLFMD-2018-00016-SKR-VMR-O-A_001.pdf. According to its results, the highest matching rates were related to the 3 vaccine strains A IRN/2005, A/GVII, and A22 IRQ/24/64.

South Korea's last annual animal health report to the OIE covered 2015; later FMD vaccination statistics are not available.

It remains to be known if the current outbreak is caused by the same FMDV-A virus strain of March 2018 or by a newly introduced, different serotype/topotype/lineage.
