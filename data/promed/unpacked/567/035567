Canada free of Asian style bird flu : officials
------------------------------------------------------------
Tests have proved that a new variant of bird flu discovered in western
Canada is not the strain of the disease that killed 24 people in Asia,
officials said. The Canada Food Inspection Agency had said this week that
investigators might have found an H5 strain of the virus on a farm in the
Fraser Valley, near Vancouver, and were testing to see if it was the H5N1
variant found in Asia.

But it said Friday, those fears were groundless.

"Further testing has revealed that geese on a Fraser Valley farm were not
infected with either H5 or H7 avian influenza," the agency said in a
statement. "There is strong evidence indicating the geese were exposed to
the H6 avian influenza virus. The H6 virus is not associated with serious
animal or human illness."

Further tests were talking place to define the exact type of virus found in
the geese and in some ducks on the farm.

Canadian authorities have ordered a massive cull of about 19 million
poultry in the Fraser Valley area, the centre of an outbreak of H7N3 bird
flu which has so far been found on 40 farms and 10 small poultry operations.

[David Halvorson kindly provided the following explanation of avian
influenza strains:]

For all avian influenza viruses, the H type only tells you about a single
gene in the virus. There are countless H6s floating around the western
hemisphere in the wild bird reservoir. Because recombination takes place in
the wild, it is impossible to determine the relatedness between any 2 H6
viruses without looking at all the genes. 2 viruses could have identical
H6s but have all 7 other genes be unique; and 2 viruses could have all the
other 7 genes identical but have different Hs. So it is possible for a H6
virus to be more closely related to a H9 (if it had 7 identical genes for
example) than another H6.

If the virus from the geese had subtyped as H5N1, it still would not have
had anything to so with the Asian H5N1.

We (the U.S.) have detected low-path H5 quite a few times in the last few
years (CA, MN, MI, TX [prior to 2004]), but these viruses had nothing to do
with Asian H5. Nonetheless, only MN avoided destroying the birds.

In our experience, all low-path AI viruses are a definite or potential
threat to domestic poultry. Because of immunosuppression, it's not unheard
of for mortality due to secondary infection to exceed 10 percent of a flock
infected with low-path AI. In the case of egg layers a production drop is
to be expected with any AI infection.

Geese on British Columbia farm not infected with H5 Avian Influenza
-------------------------
Further testing has revealed that geese on a Fraser Valley farm were not
infected with either H5 or H7 avian influenza. There is strong evidence
indicating the geese were exposed to the H6 avian influenza virus. The H6
virus is not associated with serious animal or human illness.

Initial investigation gave cause for suspicion of an H5 infection on the
farm. Further testing revealed with greater certainty that there was no H5
or H7 infection in the geese but rather a strong indication of exposure to
H6. Additional tests currently underway may further define the virus type
in the geese. Further testing will also determine the type of virus present
in the ducks on the farm.

The flock was located within 3 kilometers of 3 known infected premises and
was targeted for depopulation as part of the CFIA's avian influenza
response. The regional depopulation of animals in response to contagious
diseases such as avian influenza reflects internationally accepted animal
disease management strategies.

Detecting various subtypes of the avian influenza virus is not surprising,
particularly in birds such as geese and ducks that are usually raised
outdoors. Under such conditions, commercial birds would have contact with
wild birds, which are known to carry various subtypes of the virus. Most
subtypes carried by wild birds are low pathogenic and do not cause serious
illness in birds. Neither clinical signs nor high mortality were observed
in this flock.

Bringing the spread of avian influenza to a halt is a priority for the
Government of Canada. All required resources are being made available to
aggressively protect the health of British Columbia's poultry industry.

END of CFIA Notice

Terry Whiting's Comment:

It is unfortunate that this finding of historic evidence (serology) of
another LPAI in circulation in outdoor birds was expected, and that
expectation was not communicated to the public through early media
contacts. Minnesota's experience with outdoor turkeys over the past 25
years has been the isolation of a different LPAI every year, especially in
the period preceding 1985 after which time the industry began moving to
indoor rearing.

This Canadian example where a school was evacuated in response to the
laboratory results, demonstrates abhorrent risk communication between the
veterinary scientific community and the human health scientific communities.

As we move forward with continental AI surveillance, as I expect will
happen, we will isolate numbers of LPAI from healthy poultry directly in
proportion to the funding that Governments make available [to conduct these
tests]. What we can't afford is the public and media hysteria generated by
non-scientifically justified responses to those normal no-risk isolations.

My faith that government administrators will respond with science-based
decisions is not strengthened by current activities by North American
players reacting to commercial opportunities presented by BSE.
