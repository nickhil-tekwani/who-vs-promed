Cuban public health officials say the number of confirmed cholera cases has risen from 85 to 100 and advised residents of the worst-hit area, the southeastern province of Granma, to avoid traveling. Meanwhile, a dissident journalist in Santiago de Cuba, the island's 2nd largest city, reported that hospital workers there told him 8 people had died from cholera in Santiago hospitals.

Cuba's government has officially confirmed only 3 cholera deaths and claimed the waterborne disease has turned up in only a few cases outside its focus in Granma province.

Granma epidemiologist Ana Maria Batista reported on provincial television Tue 10 Jul 2012 that the number of confirmed cases of cholera stood at 110, an increase of 25 from the 85 that she reported on the previous day. She added that general cases of diarrhea and vomiting, the symptoms of cholera, rose by 308 to 4415 and those hospitalized with similar symptoms dropped from 112 to 81, according to doctor and dissident SM.

Batista's reports on CNC Granma television every night since Sat 7 Jul 2012, have been the lone official comments on the outbreak since a brief government statement 3 Jul 2012 confirmed the 3 cholera deaths. Dissidents have reported 5 to 15 dead.

[An independent journalist] reported Tuesday [10 Jul 2012] that 5 adults and 3 children had died from the disease in Santiago, but that authorities had told doctors they could "put anything except cholera on their death certificates." There was no way to independently confirm the information [the journalist] said he obtained from hospital employees who looked at admittance and morgue ledgers, although his report seemed unusually detailed.

Venezuela's Ministry of Health, meanwhile, joined Mexico, Germany, and the British-run Cayman Islands in expressing concern over the epidemic in Cuba, saying officials there are "on alert." Neither the CDC nor the Pan American Health Organization [PAHO], the hemispheric arm of the WHO, have issued travel advisories on Cuba.

[The numbers continue to grow but vary dramatically related to the source of the data. In most outbreaks of cholera, the number of confirmed cases is relatively small compared to the total number probably infected. With about 4500 cases of "general" diarrhea, a significant number of these numbers may well be caused by _Vibrio cholerae_. - Mod.LL
