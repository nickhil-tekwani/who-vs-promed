Health authorities in Papua New Guinea have reported an outbreak of yaws, a
skin and bone disease, in the Bitapaka area on New Britain Island.
Scientifically known as Frambesia, yaws mainly affects children living in
humid tropical regions.
Its symptoms include lesions or skin eruptions that appear and disappear
during the course of the disease. According to the acting district health
officer in the Kokopo District, Edward Lamur, 3000 cases of yaws have been
confirmed over the past 4 weeks. Medical officers are in the area carrying
out an intervention program, which includes awareness and prevention lessons.
According to the World Health Organization, yaws was supposed to have been
fully eradicated. It affects people living in unhygienic conditions and can
be spread by unsafe drinking water and lack of proper sanitation.

[Yaws has been known for several years to have re-emerged in Papua New
Guinea. Once thought eradicated, it is apparent that the disease continues
to be endemic there. It will probably remain so until problems of poverty
and poor hygiene are solved. - Mod.ES
