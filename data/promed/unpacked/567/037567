Bacteria Fears Prompt Largest Ever U.S. Meat Recall
-------------------------------------------------------
Poultry processor Pilgrim's Pride is recalling 27.4 million pounds of
cooked sandwich meat after warnings of possible contamination from
_Listeria monocytogenes_, the largest meat recall in US history. The
company pulled 295 000 pounds of turkey and chicken products Wednesday 9
Oct 2002, but expanded the recall over the weekend after tests came back
positive for a strain of the potentially fatal bacteria, the company said
Sunday, 13 Oct 2002.
The nationwide recall covers meat processed at the company's plant in
suburban Franconia from 1 May through 11 Oct 2002. The recall covers deli
meat primarily sold under the company's Wampler Foods brand, though it is
also sold under brands including Block & Barrel, Bonos, Golden Acre,
Reliance, and a variety of private labels. The products include turkey and
poultry sold freshly sliced or made into sandwiches at deli counters and in
individually sold packages of sliced deli meats.
Because consumers might not have access to the meat's original packaging,
the best way to know whether a product falls under the recall is to ask if
it comes from a package that bears the plant number P-1351 inside the U.S.
Department of Agriculture mark of inspection, said company spokesman Ray
Atkinson. Production dates also can be found on that part of the
label. The deli products were sold in retail groceries, in delicatessens
and by food service distributors.
Consumers were urged by the company to return any affected meat to the
store or deli where it was purchased for a full refund. The discovery
followed an investigation of a listeria outbreak in 8 northeast states
since early summer that caused at least 120 illnesses and 20 deaths, the
USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service said. ``We want consumers to be
aware of the recall because of the potential for foodborne illness,'' said
Dr. Garry L. McKee, the inspection service's administrator.
No products have been linked to that outbreak, said David Van Hoose,
Wampler's chief executive officer. The genetic strain that caused the
outbreak is different from the strain found at the plant, officials
said. "We don't have any scientific evidence at this point that there is a
connection, but our analysis of sampling in that plant is not complete,''
said the USDA's Steven Cohen. He said the recall was the largest in U.S.
history.
Company officials said the recall didn't include fresh turkeys, and that it
should have no effect on the holiday season.
Listeria can cause high fever, severe headache, neck stiffness and nausea,
according to the USDA. It can be fatal in young children, the elderly and
people with weak immune systems and can cause miscarriages and
stillbirths. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Web site for
listeriosis recommends that left-over or ready-to-eat foods should be
cooked until steaming hot before eating.
The company said it halted all production Saturday at the plant about 25
miles north of Philadelphia so that it could be thoroughly cleaned. The
meat being recalled makes up roughly 6 percent of the company's total
poultry production, Van Hoose said. The company didn't say how much revenue
it would lose as a result of the shutdown.
The largest previous meat recall in US history was in 1997, when Hudson
Foods recalled 25 million pounds of ground beef after 15 people in Colorado
fell ill from _E. coli_ after eating hamburger from its plant in Columbus,
Neb. The Wampler recall comes less than 3 months after ConAgra Beef
recalled nearly 19 million pounds of ground beef because of _E. coli_
contamination at its plant in Greeley, Colo.

[Although this contamination was discovered in the search for the origin of
the multistate outbreak of listeriosis in the northeastern USA, genetic
testing has found that the recall and outbreak strains are not the
same. Deli meats are always a significant concern in the spread of
listeriosis since they are ready to eat. The size of this recall
reemphasizes the potential for food-spread illnesses in today's world. -
