Central African Republic-Fever-Outbreak
---------------------------------------
A yellow fever outbreak is rocking the Boda
sub-prefecture mainly in the Ngotto village, in
south-western Central African Republic (CAR),
sources confirmed here Friday [10 Oct 2008]. The
minister of Public Health, Population and AIDS
Control, Faustin Ntelnoumbi confirmed the
outbreak in a press release issued in the capital.

The statement urged all the population in general
and particularly those in areas at risk to
quickly evacuate to the relevant care facilities
anyone showing symptoms highly suggestive of
yellow fever: sudden fever attack with jaundice
and bleeding eyes, gums and nose. Such symptoms
occur in the 2 weeks following the appearance of
the 1st symptoms of this hemorrhagic viral
disease transmitted to men through bites by
mosquito "_Aedes Aegypti_" which is infested by
the "amaril [yellow fever] virus."

"_Aedes Aegypti_" lives in gallery forests and in
areas surrounded by thick savannahs crossed by
streams filled with [monkeys, the natural host
of] the amaril [yellow fever] virus.

In its statement, the Health ministry urged the
international community to provide the support
necessary to the ongoing efforts in order to stop
the epidemic and provide its expertise to tighten
the monitoring of the yellow fever and any other
potentially epidemic diseases across the country.
According to the statement, a yellow fever case
was reported in the Boda sub-prefecture on [22
Aug 2008] in a 32-year-old male patient. The
Pasteur Institute in Bangui and the one in Dakar
where the blood sample taken on the patient was
sent confirmed the initial diagnosis.

On the other hand, no new case has been diagnosed
following additional samples taken in the Boda
village as part of an investigation conducted by
the epidemiological surveillance department in the Public Health ministry.

The findings of the tests made at the Pasteur
Institute in Bangui show however that the patient is positive.

[From the above newswire, there is a report of a
single case of yellow fever (YF) confirmed in the
Central African Republic (CAR) with date of onset
22 Aug 2008. While no other cases have been
laboratory confirmed in that area, the wording of
the above newswire seems to suggest there may be
other clinically suspected cases. Ngotto village
is to the southwest of Boda, which is to the
southwest of the capital city, Bangui. (see map
links provided below). While Boda is served by a
"major" road, Ngotto village is served a
secondary road. This moderator worked in the CAR
a number of years ago, and the terrain once one
heads outside of the capital city is one of dense
forested areas filled with flora and fauna of the
region, with a large population of primates
living in close proximity to small villages.
Primate and other forest game meat was commonly
eaten in both the rural as well as urban zones.

Earlier this year (2008), there were 2 confirmed
cases of YF in Bozoum sub-prefecture, Ouham-Pende
Prefecture, approximately 250 kms to the
northwest of Boda prefecture (see Yellow fever -
Africa (03): Central African Republic 20080521.1681).

While the newswire is mentioning the _Aedes
Agyptus_ as a key vector of the disease in the
CAR, it is the vector that is seen more commonly
in the urban yellow fever outbreaks and not in
the sylvatic outbreaks. Mutebi J-P and Barrett
ADT describe 3 cycles of YF transmission in
Africa (see Mutebi J-P, Barrett ADT. The
epidemiology of yellow fever in Africa. Microbes
and Infections. November 2002. 4(14):1459-1468):

"1. The jungle cycle: In African forests, the
virus is principally maintained by transmission
among monkeys and small mammals by the mosquito
Aedes africanus (.Haddow AJ, Smithburn KC, Dick
GWA, Kitchen SF, Lumsden WHR. Implication of the
mosquito _Aedes (Stegomyia) africanus_ Theobald
in forest cycle of yellow fever in Uganda. Ann.
Trop. M. 1948. 42:218足223.). _Ae. africanus_ is a
forest mosquito that breeds primarily in
treeholes and is only found in the jungles of
tropical Africa. The jungle cycle is very similar
to that in South America, but in South America
the principal mosquito vectors are primarily in 2
mosquito genera, _Hemagogus_ and
_Sabethes_ (Shannon RC, Whitman L, Franca M.
Yellow fever virus in jungle mosquitoes. Science.
1938. 88:110足111]. Sporadic human cases in the
form of focal outbreaks are typical, and large
epidemics involving thousands of people are rare.

"2. The intermediate cycle: The intermediate
cycle involves several mosquito species,
including _Aedes luteocephalus_, _Aedes
furcifer_, _Aedes metallicus_, _Aedes opok_,
_Aedes taylori_, _Aedes vittatus_ and members of
the _Aedes simpsoni_ complex (Germain M, Francy
DB, Monath TP, Ferrara L, Bryan J, Salaun J, Heme
G, Renaudet J, Adam C, Digoutte JP, Yellow fever
in Gambia, 1978足1979: entomological aspects and
epidemiological correlations. Am. J. Trop. Med.
Hyg. 1981. 29:929足940). The intermediate
transmission cycle is usually in areas with some
human activity, such as small village
settlements, communal herding areas and farmland.
The intermediate transmission cycle has only been
described in the moist savanna of Africa, and to
date, no such cycle has been described in the
Americas. Due to the increased potential for
transmission to humans, the potential for large YF epidemics is very high.

"3. The urban cycle: In the urban cycle, the
virus is transmitted from human to human by the
mosquito _Ae. aegypti_. This is the most deadly
form of disease transmission, potentially involving thousands of human cases."

ProMED-mail would greatly appreciate more
information from knowledgeable sources on the
current situation of yellow fever transmission in the CAR.

Boda is approximately 100 kms (60 miles) to the
southwest of the capital, Bangui. While 60 miles
may not seem a far distance, see

interactive map of the Central African Republic
which, when one zooms in the map, one can see the
sparse road network in the country thereby
increasing the difficulties in transport and communication.
