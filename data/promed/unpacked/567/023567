Mystery gas poisons dozens of Russian shoppers
-----------------------------------------------
Russian police were investigating a mystery gas smelling of garlic
that hurt dozens of shoppers when it was released into a supermarket
on Monday [26 Dec 2005] in the 2nd city of St. Petersburg.
2 other shops of the handyman store chain Maksidom were evacuated at
the height of the pre-New Year shopping period, after rescue workers
found 2 other suspicious canisters fitted with timing devices.
A spokesman for the Emergencies Ministry said 78 people had appealed
for help after smelling the gas, and 66 had been hospitalized. No one
was severely hurt.
"There were devices made out of ampules containing a so far unknown
substance, which on dispersal gave out a strong pungent smell like
garlic," said a spokeswoman for the local Federal Security Service,
the successor of the Soviet-era KGB.
She said the service was struggling to identify the gas released in
the shop. Local media quoted prosecutors as saying the gas was methyl
mercaptan, a compound added to domestic gas to give it its odor,
which is poisonous in large quantities.
"[Suspicious] containers with pipes were found in 2 other shops; they
are being defused," said Andrei Alyabyev, spokesman for the
Emergencies Ministry. Threats and raids are frequent tactics in
commercial disputes between Russian businessmen, although it would be
rare for shoppers to be targeted.

[This article does not tell us of any clinical signs suffered by the
people exposed to the gas. Typically, the odor of methyl mercaptan is
more of rotten eggs than of garlic. However, the odor used to taint
natural gas may be different in Russia than in the U.S.
The common complaint of garlic smell and a number of people being
hospitalized makes me think more of sulfur mustard gas. The smell is
often associated with the smell of sulfur, or garlic, onions or
horseradish. However, acclimation to the odor causes the sensation to
be rapidly lost.
Mustard gas may not cause detrimental effects for 2 to 48 hours. It
causes reddening of the skin, blisters and conjunctivitis.
Depending upon what the substance actually is, these people may not
be out of harm's way. - Mod.TG]
