Tanzania: Rift Valley fever cases decline in Dodoma
-----------------------------------------------
The number of Rift Valley fever (RVF) patients in Dodoma region has
dropped to 23 from 35 2 weeks ago. A report issued yesterday [14 May
2007] by Dodoma Regional Medical Officer Dr Frida Mokiti showed a
steady decline in RVF infections.
The death toll caused by RVF reached 55 since the disease erupted in
the region in early February this year [2007]. Until yesterday [14
May 2007] evening, the Regional Hospital had only 15 RVF patients.
Mirembe hospital, which had 18 patients 2 weeks ago, had only 5
yesterday. Mvumi Mission Hospital, which had 2 patients last week,
had only one yesterday.
Mpwapwa District Hospital is still grappling with the single RVF case
it had last week. Kondoa District Hospital has no RVF patient at the
moment after treating and discharging its 2 cases 2 weeks ago. Kongwa
still has its single patient, who was admitted a couple of weeks ago.
Haneti and Mtitaa dispensaries in Bahi district have successfully
treated and discharged their patients. Two weeks ago, Haneti had 3
RVF cases and Mtitaa had one. So far, a total of 42 patients have
been treated in various hospitals in the region and discharged.
The regional RVF report shows that since 1 Feb 2007, medical
facilities in the region have handled 120 RVF cases. The Regional
hospital has handled 70 cases, Mirembe Hospital (25), Kondoa (6),
Mpwapwa (6), Mvumi (5), Kongwa (4), Haneti (3), and Mtitaa (1).
Medical experts said the decrease was an indication that new
infections are fewer now and that the disease is likely to taper off
and disappear in a month or 2. Out of the 23 who were in hospital
beds yesterday [14 May 2007], only 15 have been proved positive for
the virus. Ten of them are in the Regional Hospital.
Meanwhile, the region still faces a shortage of anti-Rift Valley
fever cattle vaccines following a massive response by livestock
keepers who drive their herds to vaccination centers daily only to
realize that there are not enough jabs to go around. The response has
also posed a challenge to the region, which has only a few veterinary
officers in rural areas. The region also faces a crippling shortage
of transport facilities for officials and veterinary officers.
Veterinary service tools and materials are also short.
