Additional properties in Arizona and Texas have been placed under quarantine as new cases of vesicular stomatitis in horses continue to emerge in counties dotted close to the Mexican border.

2 new premises have been confirmed as positive for the disease in Maricopa County, Arizona. 3 further properties in the county are suspected of having the disease.

Maricopa County is the worst-affected county so far in the 2015 outbreak, with a a total of 17 premises currently under quarantine. 4 are also quarantined in nearby Yavapai County.

In Texas, 1 additional property has been confirmed with the disease in the last week. It is in Reeves County. Another property in Texas, in Pecos County, is still under quarantine as a result of an earlier case.

In New Mexico, 1 property, in Grant County, remains quarantined.

All affected properties will be eligible for release 14 - 21 days after the onset of lesions in the last affected animals.

Vesicular stomatitis is a viral infection that can affect horses, mules, cattle, bison, sheep, goats, pigs, and camelids. It also has the ability to infect people, causing flu-like symptoms, but such cases are rare.

Clinical signs include vesicles, erosions and sloughing of the skin on the muzzle, tongue, teats and above the hooves of susceptible livestock. Vesicles are usually only seen early in the course of the disease.

Its transmission is not completely understood, but biting insects are known to be a key vector, and mechanical transmission and livestock movements are also believed to play a part.

The signs are similar to those of foot and mouth disease, which is why US authorities must legally be notified of cases. In cattle, animal health agencies must establish that the signs are not a result of foot and mouth disease, which has not been seen in the US since 1929.

The 27 May 2015 update from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, an agency of the US Department of Agriculture, revealed that a total of 26 properties across the 3 states remained under quarantine.

Since the outbreak was 1st reported, on 29 Apr 2015, a total of 36 properties have been under quarantine at some stage. The only Utah properties affected so far -- 2 in Kane County -- were released from quarantine in mid-May 2015.

The 1st case recorded this season was in a horse in Grant County, confirmed by testing on 29 Apr 2015. It is considered the index case for 2015.

In the 2014 outbreak, nearly 600 horses and about 60 cattle were affected.

Cases have been recorded across a wide area of the US since the 1st outbreak was confirmed in 1937.

US outbreaks have been sporadic, but in the last 30 years the American southwest has emerged as a hotspot for the virus. The high-risk season runs from spring to fall, with a peak in mid-summer.

Outbreaks in the region tend to start in the warmer south and spread north as the weather warms.

2014's bad outbreak fit the pattern of a bad season every 8 to 10 years, with the last outbreak on a similar scale being in 2004-2006. This particular outbreak began in 2004, continued into the following year, and the virus managed to over-winter into 2006.

Before that, there were hundreds of cases reported in 1995 and 1997. There were reports, too, of large numbers of cases in 1985-86.

[It seems early in the year to have had as many VS cases as we have. Let us hope those large numbers of animals are not affected this year.
