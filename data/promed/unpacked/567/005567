A poultry flock in Huron County has been infected with a new strain of bird flu, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency said Tuesday [26 Apr 2022].

There are now 19 outbreaks of the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain of avian flu in Ontario. The federal agency estimates 250 000 birds in the province have been impacted since the 1st outbreak was declared [27 Mar 2022].

The federal agency didn't specify on its website where the affected farm is in Huron County, or the type of poultry.

The other outbreaks closest to London are near Durham in the Municipality of West Grey (confirmed 9 Apr 2022), in Chatham-Kent (confirmed 6 Apr 2022) and near Thamesford in western Oxford County (confirmed 28 Mar 2022).

Control zones have been set up around each property, so officials can control the movement of people and birds on and off those farms.

Outside of Ontario, there are outbreaks in every province except Prince Edward Island.

In 2015, federal and provincial officials spent months containing and eventually eradicating another strain of bird flu. That outbreak was contained to 3 farms in Oxford County. About 80 000 birds, mostly turkeys, were wiped out.

Bird flu continues to spread in Saskatchewan.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) says highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) was reported Sunday [24 Apr 2022] in a poultry flock in the Rural Municipality of Carmichael, 2 days after it was detected Friday [22 Apr 2022] in a poultry flock in the RM of Morse and in a small flock in the RM of Loreburn.

Those follow cases in a poultry flock in the RM of Loreburn that was reported [16 Apr 2022] and in a small flock in the RM of Moose Creek which was detected [14 Apr 2022].

The CFIA said all of the infected premises have been placed under quarantine.

"CFIA has begun an investigation and will be establishing movement control measures on other farms within that area," the agency said in a media release.

The virus was first detected in Saskatchewan in a snow goose near Elrose on [8 Apr 2022].

On [14 Apr 2022], Saskatchewan's chief veterinary officer instituted an animal health control area order to limit the co-mingling of poultry due to the risk of the flu. The order prohibits birds from being taken to and appearing in shows, auctions, agricultural fairs and any other events where birds would be brought together from multiple locations. That order is in effect until [14 May 2022].

The provincial government said there isn't any risk to food safety and the risk of transmission is low. However, people working with chickens suspected of being infected should use protective clothing.

The province said biosecurity is the best tool for poultry producers and small flock owners to protect their birds from avian flu. Biosecurity protocols include keeping wild birds away from poultry flocks and their food and water supply, limiting visitors, and monitoring bird health.

Small flock owners are encouraged to confine their birds indoors, if possible, during wild bird migration.

"AI is spreading in wild bird populations across the globe and presents a significant national concern as birds migrate to Canada," the agency's release said. "The CFIA continues to remind anyone with poultry or other susceptible birds to practice good biosecurity habits to protect them from infectious animal diseases."

[3] British Columbia (Kelowna): back yard flock

A small backyard poultry flock in Kelowna, B.C., has tested positive for avian flu, the 2nd known outbreak of the disease among flocks in British Columbia.

The highly infectious H5N1 strain of the illness was confirmed earlier this month [April 2022] on an Enderby farm in the North Okanagan.

A statement from the Ministry of Agriculture says it is working closely with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and B.C. poultry producers to ensure protection measures are in place.

The infected Kelowna flock has been quarantined and the statement says producers within a 12-kilometre [7.46 mi] radius have been notified.

The ministry also says a bald eagle recently found in Delta is positive for avian influenza, the 2nd case among wild birds in B.C. since February [2022], when the H5N1 strain was confirmed in the remains of a bald eagle in Vancouver.

Owners of small or backyard flocks are urged to watch for signs of illness in their birds, eliminate the chance for contact with wild birds and step up cleaning and disinfection of all clothing and equipment used when caring for their animals.

Outbreaks of avian influenza have been confirmed in Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Saskatchewan and Alberta, but no human cases have been detected.

The CFIA said the illness is not considered a significant concern for healthy people who are not in regular contact with infected birds.

A farm in Whitemouth, Man., was also quarantined on [23 Apr 2022] as the agency said that the province had recorded its 1st confirmed cases of H5N1 in a commercial poultry flock.

Manitoba Natural Resources and Northern Development announced last week avian flu had been detected in several snow geese collected in southwestern Manitoba and from the remains of a bald eagle found in the Dauphin area.

This has been an unprecedented year globally for avian flu, the CFIA has said.

It cautioned that migratory birds are likely responsible for the outbreaks, which spread through contact with an infected bird, its feces or nasal secretions, and the CFIA said it expected there would be more cases as wild birds continue to fly north for the summer.

B.C.'s deputy chief veterinarian has ordered all commercial poultry operators with more than 100 birds to move their flocks indoors until the spring migration ends in May [2022].

Breaking down US avian flu cases by flock type
----------------------------------------------
To date [25 Apr 2022], more than 31 million birds in the United States commercial poultry industry have been lost to the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreak of 2022.

It is a number practically unimaginable to most of us. And we need to keep in mind that these are just cases in commercial poultry and that figure does not include the backyard poultry flocks and wild birds that have also been affected by the virus.

A unique thing about this outbreak is practically every type of poultry that is raised in the United States has been infected. And at the conclusion of the past week, we broke those HPAI infections down by the type of flock.

As of [22 Apr 2022], the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) had reported there were confirmed cases in 147 commercial poultry flocks, resulting in either the natural death or the depopulation of a total of 31 022 600 birds.

While the overwhelming majority of the HPAI cases in the U.S. this year [2022] have been in turkey flocks, it is the commercial egg industry that has lost the most birds because of the larger flock sizes in layer operations. But the broiler, duck and upland gamebird industries have also not been immune to this outbreak.

The figures below came from information released by state agencies, APHIS and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE).

Egg industry losses
-------------------
The current tally on U.S. commercial egg laying operations to be impacted by HPAI in 2022 is 14, with 23 31 000 hens lost.

Two of those flocks -- both of which were in Iowa -- involved more than 5 million layers, while another case in Wisconsin had nearly 3 million hens affected, collectively making up more than half of the U.S. layers lost to the outbreak.

In addition to the layer flocks to be affected, 3 pullet operations have also been hit by HPAI, which collectively amounts to 809 000 birds. One table egg breeding operation was also infected, and that flock included 15 000 birds.

Turkey industry losses
----------------------
In 2022, 102 commercial turkey operations have been affected by HPAI, amounting to 4 411 000 turkeys. The largest affected flock involved 240 000 birds in Meeker County, Minnesota.

There have also been 6 turkey breeder hen flocks affected, for a total of 170 000 hens. A turkey breeder replacement hen flock of 68 600 birds was also impacted by HPAI.

There was also one case of HPAI in a turkey breeder flock and one case in a poult flock, involving 6900 and 8100 turkeys, respectively.

Broiler industry losses
-----------------------
Ten U.S. broiler operations have been lost to HPAI in 2022. The 2 largest operations affected were both in Butler County, Nebraska. Collectively, those 2 cases involved 987 000 birds. Those 2 cases, combined with the 3rd largest U.S. case, which involved 294 800 chickens in Stoddard County, Missouri, account for more than half of the 2 214 900 broilers lost to HPAI in 2022.

A broiler breeder flock of 60 000 birds has also been lost to HPAI this year [2022].

Duck industry losses
--------------------
Two commercial duck flocks have been affected by HPAI, accounting for 13 000 birds. In addition, a duck breeder flock of 4700 birds was also infected. All 3 cases were in Indiana.

Upland gamebird losses
----------------------
Three commercial upland gamebird operations have had positive confirmations of HPAI in 2022. One was in Texas, one was in New York and one was in South Dakota. The total of those 3 cases is 9000 birds.

Another large case of bird flu has been confirmed at a farm in Nebraska, state and federal agriculture officials said Wednesday [27 Apr 2022].

The highly-contagious avian influenza was found on a farm in Knox County in northeast Nebraska along the South Dakota border.

It is the 7th confirmed case of the disease in the state this year [2022], the Nebraska Department of Agriculture said in a news release.

More than 2.1 million laying hens will be euthanized, agriculture officials said. The farm will also be quarantined and a 6.2-mile [10 km] control zone will be established.

The department also announced an order prohibiting any type of birds from events such as fairs, expositions, swap meets, exotic sales and live bird auctions has been extended to [15 May 2022]. It was scheduled to expire on Saturday [30 Apr 2022].

[As one looks through the postings of the rampage of Avian Influenza, it becomes abundantly clear this virus is sweeping through the country a grim reaper. The virus is merciless to both domestic birds and some species of wild birds in the USA and Canada.

Destroyed bird counts are increasingly going up. This means live bird counts are going down, affecting eggs and meat birds and decreasing wildlife. As dead bird counts mount, the cost is rising in the grocery stores, and in the cost of replacement birds.

It is critical to protect your birds. Zoos and aviaries should have birds protected from wild birds and from the public. Biosecurity of any facility is paramount to trying to protect the birds. - Mod.TG
