The tuberculosis [TB] scourge in Mumbai [India] shows no sign of respite, with the number of multi-drug resistant [MDR] cases rising across the city.

Of 16 825 suspected patients tested for TB with a diagnostic tool, GeneXpert, 5994 patients were detected with TB from January 2013 till 27 Jan 2014, this year. The latest data from Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation state that 2310 cases -- 38 per cent of the ailing population -- are multi-drug resistant. A senior civic TB officer said this means that patients don't respond to the 1st-line drugs isoniazid [INH] and rifampicin [also called rifampin]. "Many patients turn multi-drug resistant after seeking faulty treatment from private practitioners over which we have little control. When they approach civic set-ups for help, their condition worsens considerably," said the officer.

Further, Mumbai has up to 122 extensively resistant TB (XDR-TB) cases. XDR-TB patients are resistant to MDR-TB drugs. [MDR-TB refers to TB caused by a strain of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampin, 2 of the most effective drugs used to treat TB. XDR-TB refers to TB caused by a subgroup of MDR-TB strains that are additionally resistant to any of the fluoroquinolone class of drugs (e.g., levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, or gatifloxacin) and any of the 3 injectable anti TB drugs (capreomycin, kanamycin and amikacin)].

A central government team including Health Secretary Kesav Desiraju and principal secretary Anshu Prakash were on a visit to Mumbai to discuss TB-related issues this week. Under the Revised National TB Control Programme (RNTCP), patients who had gone beyond MDR-TB resistance and were possibly tackling XDR-TB had to wait for up to 9 months before getting treatment. [During this period while awaiting a microbiologic diagnosis, patients with suspected XDR-TB are untreated or started on possibly inappropriate drug therapy and remain contagious, spreading disease in the community.]

Additional civic health commissioner Manisha Mhaiskar said this will change by the end of the year [2014], "with laboratories like Hinduja, JJ and Sewri TB Hospital being accredited to carry out 2nd-line liquid culture tests," said Mhaiskar.

A change in RNTCP strategy indicates that newly diagnosed MDR-TB patients will be simultaneously tested for XDR-TB. "The strategy should have been changed long ago instead of making patients wait. ... Yet, the renewed strategy will save on crucial months for which a patient had to wait before getting the right treatment. This will bring the patient respite," said a senior BMC TB official.

The central government is envisaging providing free nutritional supplements for MDR-TB patients. "However, the city currently houses 4500 MDR-TB patients on treatment, and chalking out the feasibility of catching hold of each patient to provide them meals is an uphill task," said the official.

[In 2012, an estimated 450 000 people developed MDR-TB in the world, and an estimated 64 000 cases of MDR-TB occurred in India (http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/91355/1/9789241564656_eng.pdf). According to the WHO, about 3.6 percent of new TB patients in the world have MDR-TB, and a much higher percentage, about 20 percent, of those previously treated for TB have MDR-TB. The frequency of MDR-TB varies substantially among countries and may vary regionally in some countries. According to the WHO, in India as a whole, the corresponding percents are 2.2 for new TB and 15 for previously treated TB (http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/91355/1/9789241564656_eng.pdf). We are told in the news report above that 38 per cent of TB patients in Mumbai have MDR-TB, but we are not told the percentage of MDR-TB in new TB cases versus the percentage in previously treated cases. For further discussions of MDR-TB in India, please see moderator ML's comments in prior ProMED-mail posts.

Mumbai, formerly known as Bombay, is a port city on the western coast of India and is its richest and most populous city, with a total metropolitan area population of approximately 20.5 million (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai). It is the capital of the Indian state of Maharashtra. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is the civic body that governs the city of Mumbai (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brihanmumbai_Municipal_Corporation).
