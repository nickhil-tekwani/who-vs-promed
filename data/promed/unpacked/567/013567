New bird flu [avian (A/(H5N1) influenza virus infection] cases have
been detected in 11 of West Java's 26 cities and regencies. Experts
are blaming a lack of public awareness about the importance of
cleanliness when handling poultry coupled with the effects of climate
change.

Since 4 Jan 2011, there have been 41 reported avian flu infections in
humans in Indonesia, with nearly 33 929 chickens dead from the virus.

West Java Animal Husbandry Office head Kusmayadi said Monday [28 Feb
2011] that the virus was spreading because of the unpredictable
weather. The largest number of chicken deaths was found in a poultry
shed in Sukabumi, where 30 000 chickens had died. "Raining, dry,
raining, dry. The weather has strengthened the attacking power of the
virus at a time when public awareness is diminishing," Kusmayadi
said.

The 11 cities and regencies struck by the new bird flu outbreaks were
Bekasi, West Bandung, Purwakarta, Majalengka, Sukabumi, Kuningan,
Indramayu, Garut, Depok, Bogor, and Sumedang. The latest case was in
Garut, where 1000 chickens raised in residents' yards were reported to
have died since 12 Jan 2011, because of the virus.

"They were late to report [the deaths] and the chicken carcasses were
thrown randomly in open fields," Garut Animal Husbandry Office head
Dida K Endang said.

In Dumai, Riau, a bird flu outbreak was also reported following the
discovery of hundreds of dead chickens in a number of areas.

Agus of the Pekanbaru Animal Husbandry Office said Monday [28 Feb
2011] that bird flu infections had been detected in several
subdistricts in West Dumai district. "After checking the officers
found one bird flu infection in Bukit Timah subdistrict. Out of the 3
chickens tested, 2 were bird flu positive," Agus said, as quoted by
Antara news agency.

"The Participatory Disease Surveillance & Response (PDSR) programme
through 33 Local Disease Control Centres covers 71 547 villages in 85
percent of Indonesia's 448 districts and municipalities in 29 of its
33 provinces. During December 2010, PDSR conducted surveillance in
