Cholera has killed 24 people and infected more than 2000 others in
southern Malawi, where hunger is driving desperate villagers to eat
contaminated food, health officials said on Mon, 20 Feb 2006.
Blantyre, the eastern African nation's commercial hub, and the famous
resort district of Mangochi are among the areas hardest hit by an
outbreak of the disease, Secretary of Health Wesley Sangala said. At
least 2265 people have been infected, he added.
The outbreak began late in 2005 and comes on the heels of a drought
and subsequent severe food shortages that have left nearly half of
Malawi's estimated 12 million people with little to eat. The crisis
is particularly bad in the southern province.
"We strongly suspect that people are rushing to eat food without
washing with clean water because of hunger ... this could be the
reason why we have a lot (of) people infected compared to the same
month in 2005," said Habib Somanje, the ministry's head of preventive
health services.

[4] Cholera - Zimbabwe (Harare)

In Zimbabwe's capital Harare, for the first time in most people's
memory people are dying of cholera. There have been about 30 deaths
from cholera this summer season, 5 of them in the last week.
If there was a competition for the worst sewage problem in Harare, a
suburb called Dvaraskewa, about 12 kilometers west of the city, would
be a contender. Even after several days of hot sunshine and no rain
there are sewage puddles all over the township. Storm drains are
blocked and sewage is seeping into every road and path.
The smell in Dvaraskewa is unbearable in some parts. In others the
smell is less pungent, but nowhere throughout the suburb of about
3000 houses and a population of about 200 000 does the air smell
clean, or even neutral. The situation grew worse following the
governments campaign of urban renewal that it called "Clean out the
Trash," or Operation Murambatsvina in the majority Shona language.
The UN said more than 700 000 urban residents were left homeless when
bulldozers crushed small homes in May and June of 2005.

[5] Cholera - Sudan (Central Equatoria State)

A cholera outbreak in south Sudan has claimed 52 lives, with more
than 2000 cases of the deadly disease which spreads rapidly through
brimming urban centers, the WHO said on Sat, 18 Feb 2006.
The disease, identified this week as cholera, has infected 2029
people in the towns of Yei and the regional capital Juba, and aid
agencies are rushing to prevent the outbreak spreading to neighboring
towns.
"Chlorination of public water supplies have begun and emergency
stocks of rehydration supplies ... have been pre-positioned at all
high-risk points," WHO said in a statement sent to Reuters on 18 Feb
2006.
2/3 of south Sudan's population drinks unsafe water. The death toll
has almost doubled in the past week.
After a 2005 peace deal which ended Africa's longest civil war in
Sudan's south, hundreds of thousands of people have been returning
home. They have flocked to urban centres whose already creaking
infra-structures are unable to cope with the extra burden.

What should be noted that as the cholera season has progressed, with
the rains moving from west to east across the continent, the
countries prominently affected are now further east and south of
those affected previously. - Mod.LL]
