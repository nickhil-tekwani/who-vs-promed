The Agriculture and Cooperatives Ministry
yesterday denied vehemently it had been covering
up fresh outbreaks of bird flu following reports
of mass deaths of poultry over the past few
weeks. It could not possibly conceal such
outbreaks because its bird flu surveillance and
diagnostic operations were monitored closely by
various agencies such as the World Organisation
for Animal Health, said Charal Trinvuthipong,
assistant to the agriculture and cooperatives
minister.
Covering up bird flu outbreaks would also end up
doing more harm than good to the country, he
added.
Officials had conducted so-called "X-ray" bird
flu surveillance tests nationwide [beginning in
June 2006] and about 53 000 fowl tissue samples
tested negative for bird flu, Mr Charal said.
About 61 million poultry died or were culled in
the 1st outbreak. But H5N1 has not been detected
in Thailand since November [2005].
"Our ongoing active bird flu surveillance
operations may have misled people into believing
there have been bird flu outbreaks. It's true
that the disease, which is now endemic to
Thailand, may emerge again today or tomorrow.
However, it is impossible for us to cover up
outbreaks if they do occur," said Mr Charal.
The Livestock Development Department reported on
Sunday that fowl died in huge numbers in 430
tambons [subdistricts] in 50 provinces. The
department's laboratory tests confirmed that 351
tambons were free of bird flu, while 79 tambons
in 23 provinces were still awaiting test results.
Meanwhile, more chicken deaths were reported
yesterday, including about 1000 in Phichit and
300 in Phitsanulok provinces. The test results on
the samples are due to be released next week.
Pornchai Chamnanpood, director of the
department's National Institute of Animal Health,
a focal point for diagnosing bird flu in animals,
said the fowl deaths were caused by weather
fluctuations and environmental changes, which had
prompted some fungi and bacteria to grow more
rapidly, devastating livestock. The lethal
organisms had been found in some chicken
carcasses. However, a high-level source at the
department said about 10 percent of samples were
unsuitable for diagnosis of H5N1. The bird flu
virus could be elusive and impossible to detect
in some cases.
Yukol Limlamthong, head of the Livestock
Development Department, said that since the
disease was already present in the country, the
department did not rule out a possibility of a
re-emergence of the virus. The department had
been upgrading poultry farm management along with
imposing strict controls on fowl movements and
carrying out frequent disinfections of bird
flu-risk areas as part of the bird flu prevention
and surveillance scheme.

Pinij Charusombat, caretaker Public Health
Minister, said yesterday [17 Jul 2006] there were
no new bird-flu infections -- and no cover-up, as
many feared.
"We never cover up cases, as it would damage our
national health security, which has been
appreciated by the international community," he
said.
Pinij said if new cases were found he would
report them to the public, the international
community and the World Health Organisation
(WHO). He insisted that there have been no cases
of humans becoming infected since 7 Dec 2005.
The Department of Livestock Development has
admitted many chickens died mysteriously in the
northern provinces, particularly in Phichit.
However, Pornchai Chamnanpood, director of the
National Institute of Animal Health, said
laboratory tests on the dead chickens showed all
were caused by [fowl] cholera. [So far in 2006], more
than 53 000 dead chickens have been sent to the
institute for tests.
"It sounds a lot, but the death of chickens
raised in backyards is no surprise. Those
environments are not as hygienic as commercial
farms, so it's easy for chickens to get sick and
die," he said.

[Thailand's 1st cases of avian influenza in
humans were conclusively diagnosed on 23 Jan 2004
and immediately notified to the WHO. Accuracy,
transparency and timeliness have characterised
Thailand's public health authorities throughout
the epidemic.
Prior to the above 1st notification, Thailand's
Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives denied
vehemently the presence of Highly pathogenic
avian influenza (HPAI) in poultry, arguing that
the numerous observed outbreaks were caused by a
bacterium (Fowl cholera, pasteurellosis). Such
information was sent to the OIE (and copied to
ProMED-mail following our request for
information; see 20040109.0097). A day after the
notification of the disease in humans, the
Ministry of Agriculture officially notified that
HPAI virus type A, subtype H5, was diagnosed in
poultry (see references).
On 31 Mar 2006, Thailand sent its final report
(follow-up report No. 87) to the OIE; a final
report means that the epizootic was terminated.
This statement was based upon the following
forwarded information:
"1. 140 days have elapsed since the last case of
HPAI in Thailand (on 9 Nov 2005), where
stamping-out with compensation was employed.
2. In February 2006, the Department of Livestock
Development conducted the first biannual HPAI
active surveillance. During the month, 57 461
cloacal swab samples were collected for virus
isolation. To date, no new positive case has been
reported in Thailand". (see
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_24.HTM#Sec6>)."
If the statement of Mr Charal Trinvuthipongin,
cited in the 1st newswire above, saying that "the
disease is now endemic", is correct -- it might
be plausible to guess that outbreaks might
reappear, or are already there. This, mainly in
backyard poultry and small holdings, and
particularly since vaccination against HPAI is
officially prohibited in Thailand.
Current requests for reassuring clarification regarding the disease situation
in Thailand should be seen in the light of the above background and history. -
