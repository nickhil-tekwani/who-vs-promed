Yellow fever - Bolivia (Santa Cruz): RFI 990210211317

From: sternbtl@howasg01.howard.af.mil

As Joint Inter Agency Task Force (South) Surgeon, I travel a lot to South
America. I have recently traveled to the city of Santa Cruz. The
Department (state) of Santa Cruz had no deaths from yellow fever during 1997
and 1998.
When I arrived on 17 Jan [1999, they had had 3 deaths so far in 1999, and
by the time I left 5 days later, the toll had risen to 10.
The Ministerio de Salud (Ministry of Health) has rejuvenated the vaccination
program. But as of 22 Jan [1999, per article in "La Razon" (La Paz daily
newspaper),
approximately one million vaccinations were still needed in Santa Cruz
department, as 40 % of the population is yet unvaccinated.
Santa Cruz Department is a large state running from the foothills of the
Andes to the eastern Amazonian flatlands. The city of Santa Cruz has a
poopulation of about a million people and is relatively void of
mosquito-borne diseases. The rural area is where both yellow fever and
malaria occur.
