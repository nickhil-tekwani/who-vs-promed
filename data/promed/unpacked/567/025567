Veterinary Services: Vaccination conducted in 14 provinces
-------------------------------------------
According to the weekly follow-up report to the Ministry of Agriculture by the General Authority for Veterinary Services [GOVS], the number of suspected cases of the Foot and mouth disease [FMD] SAT 2 strain since the initial detection of the disease in Egypt on 26 Feb 2012, has reached 83 788, of which 80 314 recovered. 20 303 animals died. [The figures in the previous weekly report, dated 29 Apr 2012, were -- respectively -- 82 362, 76 680 and 19 655, which means that during the recent week, 1426 clinical cases and 648 mortalities have, reportedly, been added. -Mod. AS]. Most of the deaths involved suckling calves under the age of 2 months. The data have been forwarded by the directorates of veterinary medicine, nationwide.

According to the information received by the Minister of Agriculture, Mohamed Reza Ismail, most of the suspected cases were conncentrated in 3 governorates (provinces), namely Gharbiya, Dakahliya and Suez. [Gharbiya=West includes the largest concentration of dairy farms in Egypt. Previous FMDV SAT 2 figures for each of Egypt's governorates were included in posting 20120408.1094045. - Mod. AS]. The 2 governorates with the lowest figures are the Red Sea, with 231 clinical cases and no mortalities reported so far, and Northern Sinai, which reporded a single outbreak since the emergence of the disease.

Dr Essam Abdel Shakur, head of the central Information and Extension Service Department at the Head Office of the General Organisation of Veterinary Services [GOVS], told "Al youm al-sabb'ah" that the vaccination campaign is continuing, applying the vaccine against the new SAT 2 virus strain. He also said that other veterinary activities in the villages and hamlets, in particular guidance to stock holders, by trained young instructors, on sanitary and other preventive measures are intensified. The vaccine, now applied in 14 governorates, has been produced locally in the laboratory of the Serum and Vaccine Institute, Abbassiya, in cooperation with the Holding company of the Ministry of Health, "VACSERA". He said that vaccination will cover also other FMD virus strains which are endemic in Egypt, namely A and O, as well as Rift Valley Fever [RVF], also an endemic disease. He stressed the ban upon transportation of animals between provinces.

Abdel Shakur pointed out that the high temperatures during the last few days will further decrease the numbers of suspected cases and deaths.

[The mention made of RVF (an important zoonotic disease) among the vaccines against which the entire ruminant population in Egypt is to be vaccinated, seemingly combined with the SAT 2 vaccine, has been briefly discussed in a previous posting (20120410.1096341). If -- as one is inclined to assume upon reading the above and previous media reports -- the vaccine applied is to be multivalent and to include RVF, this may mean that Egypt has discontinued the use of a live-attenuated RVF vaccine (Smithburn vaccine) and returned to the use of a killed vaccine. Is this the case? If affirmative, such a change is in line with past scientific recommendations. The issue has been comprehensively discussed in a recent paper (Ref 1). The paper also provides updated and detailed information on the actual RVF situation in Egypt, indicating that the 5 largest Egyptian RVF outbreaks in the animal domain have taken place in 1977-1978, 1993, 1994, 1997 and 2003. Available information on the virus activity in inter-epizootic periods is provided as well.

In view of the importance of such information internationally, it will be much appreciated and gratefully acknowledged if details on Egypt's RVF vaccination policy, particularly clarifying the nature (live-attenuated or killed) of the vaccine currently in use, will become available from authoritative sources.
