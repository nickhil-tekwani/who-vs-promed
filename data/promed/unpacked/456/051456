the opening of their new, updated Bulletin Board System (BBS). The BBS
is using Worldgroup as a client. The Worldgroup client is provided

chat, forums, files, paint program etc. To download the Worldgroup
client go to the following URL:

Once downloaded click on the file from your desktop explorer or DOS.
The file is self executing. It will install automatically. You can then
click on the ICON on your desktop and next see the Worldgroup open.
There will be another ICON that says "WHO BBS". Click on the ICON and
wait untill you are connected. You will be updated. Please go to
registration and register to use the WHO BBS.

The WHO BBS Global Public Health Network welcomes contributions
