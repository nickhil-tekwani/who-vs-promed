A total of 29 children under the age of 3 -- 12 in Hasparren and 17 in Briscous -- were victims of food poisoning on Thursday [31 Mar 2022]. These children are registered in the intercommunal crèches of the villages mentioned. None of them had to be hospitalized, but many were sick with vomiting in the early afternoon. The Bayonne SAMU came to provide a rapid response to this situation and reassure the parents.

It should be noted that the meals of the 2 structures are made in Hasparren, where the cook in charge that day was consulted by the Regional Health Agency (ARS). "The ARS and the departmental directorate for the protection (DDPP) of the populations of the Pyrénées-Atlantiques took samples on the spot, with a view to analysis to determine the exact cause of this intoxication," indicates the sub-prefect of Bayonne, Philippe Le Moing-Surzur, who also traveled there. "A follow-up has been put in place," he continued and care was obviously provided by the nurseries for those who could not pick up their children immediately. The sub-prefecture indicates that a "standard prescription was given to the parents" and that "supervisory advice was given to them by the emergency services, in the context of a possible gastroenteritis which would occur later."

[Given what appears to be a short incubation foodborne illness associated primarily with vomiting, illness due to _Staphylococcus aureus_ enterotoxin could be suspected.

Staphylococcal enterotoxins are fast acting, sometimes causing illness in as little as 30 minutes but usually in 4-6 hours, with nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps, and little if any fever. The patients usually recover within a day. A non-febrile illness primarily with vomiting is suggestive of staphylococcal enterotoxin-associated illness where foods are not adequately handled and _Staphylococcus aureus_ is allowed to grow and produce toxin. A toxin dose of less than 1.0 microgram in contaminated food will produce symptoms of staphylococcal intoxication. This toxin level is reached when _S. aureus_ populations exceed 100 000 per gram.

Foods that are frequently incriminated in staphylococcal food poisoning include meat and meat products; poultry and egg products; salads such as egg, tuna, chicken, potato, and macaroni; bakery products such as cream-filled pastries, cream pies, and chocolate eclairs; sandwich fillings; and milk and dairy products. Foods that require considerable handling during preparation, and that are kept at slightly elevated temperatures after preparation, are frequently involved in staphylococcal food poisoning.

A very short incubation of a vomiting-associated illness (less than one hour) also suggests that the etiology might have been heavy metal ingestion. A number of metals can cause this type of syndrome, which is usually caused by the ingestion of a liquid that had been kept in a metallic container. These metals include antimony, copper, tin, and zinc. The illnesses are usually self-limiting and require only symptomatic care. In addition to vomiting, other clues may include the liquid being described as having a metallic taste. Identifying the specific cause requires analysis of the food or liquid vehicle. Some potential differences in the illnesses exist between causes, including a longer incubation period (several hours) for zinc; vomiting and diarrhea for tin; and blue or green vomitus for copper. Other chemical toxins can also produce this syndrome of illness.

Pyrénées-Atlantiques is a department in the southwest corner of France in the region of Nouvelle-Aquitaine. Named after the Pyrenees mountain range and the Atlantic Ocean, it covers the French Basque Country and the Béarn (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrénées-Atlantiques). - Mod.LL
