The Inquiry people are back from recess with a fascinating history of
British rendering back to Roman times (well, 1865).

The Inquiry will return to scientific evidence at the beginning of Stage 4
on Monday 1st June. I must say, this continues to be a most impressive forum
in terms of openness and competency. There is a color picture of Judge
Phillps, Ferguson-Smith and June Bridgeman (but not Walker) on page 532 of
the 9 April 98 issue of Nature or see <http://www.mad-cow.org/inq.jpeg>
The timely talk today about bypass protein sheds light on items going around
the Internet that blame the whole BSE mess on a Unilever subsidiary named
BOCM, the advent of linear programming and secret ingredients, cut-throat
competitiveness, and an early cannibalistic product called UDP -
undegradable protein.

out this morning and they already had the day's proceedings posted. But
beware, Monday was 54pp and Tuesday 55pp! - Mod.MHJ
