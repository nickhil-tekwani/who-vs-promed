A Greenbrier veterinarian went into emergency mode after discovering that a domestic dog from White County that bit him was rabid.

"It came in for an exam for weight loss and other symptoms," said Dr. Carl Fulton of Faulkner County Veterinary Clinic in Greenbrier. "At first, the owner didn't tell us about aggression. After I was bitten, we watched the dog and found it was neurologic, and the dog was having some changes that weren't evident at the time."

He said the dog was not exposed in Faulkner County, and rabies in domestic animals is not terribly common. However, rabies exists locally. Rabies is more common in wild animals that have little to no contact with humans, Fulton said. When a domestic animal is infected, more humans are typically exposed through bites or saliva.

The rabid dog that came to his office for an exam exposed about 10-12 people including Fulton and his staff. Fulton had a pre-exposure vaccine in veterinary school, so he received 2 additional vaccines after he was bitten. His staff had to receive several vaccines in addition to immunoglobulin for immediate production of rabies antibodies.

"The vaccine protocol is not as severe as it was in the past where as many as 48 shots had to be given, mainly in the stomach," Fulton said. "Thank goodness it's not that bad anymore."

Fulton said rabies can be prevented in domestic animals with a rabies vaccine either yearly or every 3 years.

"It's state law that all domestic cats and dogs get vaccinated on a regular basis," he said.

According to the Arkansas Department of Health (ADH), skunks are the most common reservoir for rabies in Arkansas. In 2014, 109 skunks tested positive for rabies.

Bats are the 2nd most common carrier of rabies in Arkansas, and 34 tested positive for rabies in 2014.

In Faulkner County, 1 skunk tested positive for rabies in 2014, accounting for one of 151 positive rabies tests in Arkansas. Pulaski County had the highest number of positive results with 21 positive rabies results in 2014.

1 human was infected with rabies in the U.S. in 2014.

The case, which was detected in Missouri, was fatal and spurred follow-up interviews with 2 people from Independence County in Arkansas. ADH found no risk of transmission in either Arkansas resident.

Fulton said all of his staff successfully completed the postexposure treatment following the bite on 2 Jul 2015, and the ADH recommended those vaccines for everyone who was exposed.

ADH recommends washing wounds well with soap and water and applying antiseptic in the event of an animal bite.

ADH is also available to help with risk assessment for potential rabies exposure by calling 501-661-2000 or 800-462-0599.

Though rabies is uncommon in dogs, cats and ferrets in the U.S., an animal that bites a human should be quarantined for 10 days.

"If a dog is healthy 10 days after it bit someone, you don't have to worry about it being rabid," Fulton said, adding that rabies can be difficult to recognize in animals because symptoms can range from severe aggression to severe lethargy.

He said the owner of the rabid dog that bit him elected to have the dog euthanized and tested. The result was positive for rabies.

"The most important thing is to make sure you have all your animals vaccinated," Fulton said. "There's no huge outbreak, but it is out there."

[Arkansas has its rabies rules posted at http://www.healthy.arkansas.gov/aboutADH/RulesRegs/RabiesRule.pdf

Dogs and cats should be vaccinated by 4 months of age.

In high-risk jobs, such as a veterinary medicine, individuals should have their titer checked every 2 years to ensure they are maintaining their protective level.

Hopefully all exposed individuals will be all right. - Mod.TG
