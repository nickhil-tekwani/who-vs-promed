The Central and West African regions are under siege from a cholera outbreak that has infected over 1000 people in Nigeria, Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and Congo-Brazzaville [Republic of the Congo].

In its latest epidemiological update report for the 2 regions which also suffer from the impacts of ongoing civil and political strife, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) said 828 cholera cases have been reported from 12 states of Nigeria while 38 cases and 4 deaths were confirmed in northern Cameroon between 18 May 2018 and 9 Jul 2018.

"In the Democratic Republic of Congo, more than 500 cholera cases reported were reported by week 25 and 26 [18 May-1 Jul 2018], despite an overall low completeness. The Grand Kasai region gathers almost half of the total reported cases with a high lethality," the report said.

In the neighboring Republic of Congo (distinctly known as Congo-Brazzaville, 1 confirmed and 5 suspected cases were under management in the Brazzaville local government area by mid-week. To date, one out of the 5 cases has tested negative. Tests results for the other cases are still pending.

The health ministry said 6 people have died in Cameroon from a cholera outbreak that has infected 43 people since May 2018. "Cases of cholera were documented since May 2018 in 4 districts in northern regions," health minister Andre Mama Fouda said in a statement sent late [Sat 14 Jul 2018]. He said one case of the disease had been found in the capital Yaounde. "From the moment the 1st cases were documented in the northern region, every measure was taken to contain the epidemic," Fouda said.

Cholera is caused by a bacterium transmitted through contaminated food or drinking water. It causes acute diarrhoea, with children particularly at risk. In 2010, an outbreak of the disease killed more than 750 people across Cameroon.

No fewer than 20 persons have died in about 181 cases recorded since a cholera outbreak hit some parts of Katsina state in the last 2 weeks. This is just as the State House of Assembly said the officials of the state Ministry of Health and the State Primary Health Care Development Agency (SPHCDA) were still making efforts to curtail the spread of the disease in the 34 local government areas of the state. The chairman of the House committee on the disease, Tasiu Musa Maigari, representing Zango constituency, made this known yesterday, 9 Jul 2018, while submitting the committee's report. The committee recommended that the state should provide more potable water supply in the affected communities and step up sensitization of the residents of the communities while making case for suspected patients of the disease to be rushed to the nearest health facilities and quarantine of cholera patients for medication.

The lawmakers adopted the report after deliberation during the House plenary and the speaker of the assembly, Abubakar Yahaya Kusada, directed the house clerk to transmit the four point recommendations to the executive for implementation. It would be recalled that the committee was set up in the House penultimate Monday [?2 Jul 2018] following a motion of urgent public importance moved by Muhammad Abubakar, member representing Funtua where no fewer than 5 persons had died of the disease.

Dr Amos Ujulu, director of the Disease Control Department (DCD), Adamawa State Primary Health Care Development Agency (ASPHCDA), says the state has recorded 1564 cases of cholera in 2018. Ujulu disclosed this during his presentation on the recent outbreak of cholera to the state executive council meeting in Yola. He said that over 100 communities were affected by the outbreak of cholera in the northern part of the state. He listed the affected local government areas as Maiha, Mubi North, and Mubi South, adding that the disease further spread to some parts of Cameroon bordering Nigeria.

According to him, the state had established a cholera emergency response secretariat in Maiha for quick response to its outbreak in the area. Ajulu said that N 22 million [about USD 61 000] was required to check further spread of cholera, which has claimed 26 lives in the state. He disclosed that 12 other international partners that have rendered intervention would withdraw in the coming week. He urged the state government to render greater commitment to end the cholera outbreak as the disease could spread to other local government areas.

Responding, Mr Martins Babale, the deputy governor of the state, said that the state would boost water supply in the state, adding that the government is committed to hasten work on the development of the state water plant project. He said that good sanitation and efficient water supply was the major solution to curtail the outbreak of cholera in the state. He also said that the government would collaborate with various development partners to ensure that the state does not experience the scourge again. NAN [News Agency of Nigeria] recalls that the cholera outbreak has claimed 26 lives in the state.

Vadodara district collector Shalini Agrawal on [Mon 16 Jul 2018] issued a notification declaring Khedkarmsiya village in Waghodia taluka [county] of Vadodara cholera-affected after 31 persons complained of symptoms of the disease.

According to chief district health officer Dr Uday Tilavat, 15 residents of Khedkarmsiya village had complained of diarrhea and vomiting on Sat 14 Jul 2018. Out of these, 6 were admitted to a community health centre in Jarod while 2 were referred to SSG hospital in Vadodara. Rest of the persons were treated locally and prescribed medicines. By Mon 16 Jul 2018, however, the number of affected persons increased to 31. Out of these, 21 have been admitted to hospitals.

"On [Sat 13 Jul 2018] we sent 6 samples for testing. 4 of the samples have tested positive and so we had to issue the notification," said Tilavat. He said that the reason for the spread of the waterborne disease was a damaged boring line, dumped with garbage, which had contaminated the water that was being pumped up to overhead tanks for drinking purposes. "We have done our preliminary task of cleaning and repairing the line," Tilavat added.

Cholera, an acute diarrheal infection that can kill if left untreated, has come back with July's [2018] heavy downpour. On [Mon 16 Jul 2018], the BMC [Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai] said that 2 residents had cholera from the B and E wards that cover areas such as Dongri, Byculla, and Mazgaon, have reported sporadic cases of cholera in the past as well.

BMC's executive health officer Dr Padmaja Keskar said that both patients were admitted to a municipal hospital and successfully treated. "Following the detection of these cases, we screened the areas but didn't find any more cases," she said.

Keskar said that mild cases of cholera are seen during monsoon. Last July 2017, too, a single case of cholera was reported.

Hong Kong health officials report investigating an imported cholera case in a 25 year old female patient who traveled to Malaysia. The patient traveled to Malaysia from 30 Jun 2018 to 3 Jul 2018 and developed diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting started on 3 Jul 2018. She was admitted to Union Hospital on 8 Jul 2018 and was discharged 2 days later.

According to testing performed by the Centre for Health Protection's (CHP) Public Health Laboratory Services Branch, the patient's stool tested positive for toxigenic _Vibrio cholerae_ O1 serotype Ogawa. The patient was admitted to Princess Margaret Hospital on 11 Jul 2018 for isolation and management. She has been in a stable condition all along. Initial inquiries revealed that the patient had no travel companions in her recent trip and her home contacts remained asymptomatic. The CHP's investigations are ongoing.

"Most cholera patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea or vomiting. Some patients with severe symptoms present with a sudden onset of profuse diarrhea with rice-water-like and fishy smelling stools, nausea, and vomiting. Without prompt treatment, these patients may die from severe dehydration," a spokesman for the CHP said.

The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) has confirmed a case of cholera (_V. cholera_ O1 Ogawa, CTX+) in a passenger's stool sample who traveled on Korean Air flight KE656, which flew in from Mumbai, India, to Incheon International Airport recently. Upon confirmation of the cholera bacterium, the respective public health center in Busan, the patient's city of residence, was notified immediately. The center subsequently conducted an epidemiological investigation and is currently monitoring any contacts of the patient following re-entry into Korea for any symptoms of the disease.

KCDC urges any individuals who were on the same flight as the patient to visit the nearest hospital, inform medical professionals of their recent travel history, and request cholera testing if they experience serious diarrhea or vomiting.

The mortality from cholera and most diarrheal illnesses is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.

As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2018, pp 113-127, oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 per cent to 3.6 per cent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
