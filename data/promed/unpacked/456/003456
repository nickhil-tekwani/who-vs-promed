Plant virus takes toll on area's tomato crop
-------------------
A plant virus that has damaged Pitt County's tobacco crop [is also]
destroying area tomato plants.
... Tomato spotted wilt virus has infected an estimated 15 percent to 20
percent of Pitt County's tobacco crop, said Mitch Smith, director of the
N.C. Cooperative Extension Service Center in Pitt County. State officials
estimate up to 15 percent of the state's entire tobacco crop is infected
with the virus. [According to Smith, the net value of the 9500-acre tobacco
crop is $45 million].
The virus also infects tomatoes, peppers, potatoes, and peanuts. Officials
roughly estimate between 15 percent and 25 percent of the state's
commercial tomato crop has been infected. Scientists still are determining
how much of the potato and peanut crops may be damaged.
"It's been quite devastating in our eastern counties," Frank Louws,
associate professor of plant pathology at North Carolina State University,
said. While the virus previously appeared in the state, this growing season
is the first major outbreak [of the disease].
The virus lives in the saliva of thrips, small insects that use wind to
move from plant to plant. When [the insect] ... lands on a plant leaf and
bites, its saliva enters the plant, [resulting in infection] ... [According
to Louws], ... spraying [insecticides] and removing plants do little to
control the outbreak ... .
[According to Smith,] ... April was a very windy month, and it helped to
distribute the thrips across fields. ... [That], with ... a fairly warm
winter ... allowed the insect population to multiply.
No one has calculated the financial loss to produce growers. One Pitt
County farmer said it depends on whether he can salvage his existing plants
and start a second crop.
Carlton White, a produce farmer for the last 14 years, has lost more than
40 percent of the 500 tomato plants he was growing.
Because he is a small operator, White typically grows his crop from seed.
Hoping to salvage his season, he plans to buy seedlings from a Virginia
wholesaler and plant a second crop. He is unsure how successful that second
crop will be.
So far, White has been the only local commercial tomato grower to report
crop losses.
"The reality is there are a lot of tomatoes grown, so if there is a
shortage, some other state will fill that vacuum," Louws said. "But for
people who like to support their local growers and want that good tasting
local tomato, that's going to be in short supply."

[Extension plant pathologists in several states have been contacted to
determine whether there are other outbreaks. The disease has not been
reported on tomato in Arizona, New Jersey, New York (last report was in
1993), or Oregon. It has been reported in Kentucky (lowest incidence in 5
years) and on tobacco, but not on tomato, in Maryland. - Mod.DH]
