As of 22 Nov 2005, WHO has received reports of 53 suspected cases and
23 deaths in the Bafoulabe district of Kayes region.
The mass vaccination campaign in this district has been completed,
and 186 553 persons have been immunized, resulting in 95 percent
vaccination coverage. The 2.2 million doses of yellow fever vaccine
provided from the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization
(GAVI) emergency stockpile, through the International Coordinating
Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision for Yellow fever Control, are
scheduled to arrive on 29 Nov 2005. These doses will be used to
target the population of the 6 other surrounding high-risk districts
(Kangaba, Kati, Kayes, Kenieba, Kita and Yanfolia).
The team from the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (see
previous report) with the addition of an entomologist, has arrived in
Mali and will assist the Ministry of Health in responding to the outbreak.
