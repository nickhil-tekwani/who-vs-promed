Background information on Rocky Mountain spotted fever in Latin America
-------------------------------------
Brazil
The disease is known locally as 'Brazilian spotted fever,' and has been
described in Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, Goias, Rio Grande do Sul,
and Espirito Santo. The disease was first reported in Brazil in 1920. 10.1
percent of children and 4.1 percent of dogs in Minas Gerais were
seropositive in 1998.
92 cases (40 percent fatal) were confirmed in Minas Gerais during 1981 to
1989; 78 during 1992 to 1997 (including 3 fatal cases in 1996, and 2 in
1997). 17 cases (8 fatal) were reported in Pedreira county, Sao Paulo
during 1985 to 1995. 10.6 percent of healthy students in the endemic areas
of Minas Gerais were seropositive in 1998.
The principal vector is _Amblyomma cajennense_. _Amblyomma cooperi_ has
also been implicated (in Sao Paulo). 1.3 percent of _Am. cajennense_ in
Minas Gerais carry the organism. Spotted fever-group rickettsiae have been
found in _Rhipicephalus sanguineus_ in Rio de Janeiro state.
Argentina
A cluster of 4 pediatric cases was reported from Jujuy Province during 1993
to 1994.
Four percent of asymptomatic subjects in Saladillo (Jujuy) are
seropositive. The presumed local vector is _Amblyomma cajennense_.
Mexico
During 1930 to 1950, cases were reported from Coahuila, Durango, San Luis
Potosi, Sinaloa, and Sonora.
5.6 percent of persons in rural Yucatan are seropositive toward spotted
fever - group rickettsiae (possibly the _R. akari_ group).
The local vector is _Rhipicephalus sanguineus_.
