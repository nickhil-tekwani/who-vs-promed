A cattle disease that hasn't previously been found in Western Australia has been detected in several animals on 2 properties in the Southern Agricultural Region. The disease is called bovine anaemia due to _Theileria orientalis_ group, or BATOG.

Dr Mia Carbon is the animal disease control manager with the Department of Agriculture and Food Western Australia (DAFWA), she says the disease is caused by a blood parasite which has been present in eastern Australia since 2005.

"The clinical signs are anaemia, which will typically be seen in the cattle by a paleness of the mucus membranes; there can also be jaundice, so there can be some yellowing of the eyes and gums; they can be quite depressed, off their food, and they'll often have a high fever. They may also show some reproductive signs, such as abortions or still births, and they can they can have some blood in the urine."

Dr Carbon says the disease is thought to be spread by bush ticks and possibly other native ticks. "Once a cow is infected it is typically infected for life. Cattle most at risk are the ones that are kept in the habitat of the tick, so scrubby or woodland areas. Cattle on open pasture should have very little contact with the tick vectors."

BATOG has been found in Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland. "There are no movement controls for cattle moving from the eastern states with regards to this disease," Dr Carbon said.

DAFWA has created factsheets on the disease, which can be found at http://www.agric.wa.gov.au.

[Theileria are protozoan parasites carried by ticks. When ticks carrying theileria feed on cattle, the parasite gets into their bloodstream and enters red blood cells. In some animals, sufficient red blood cells are destroyed to cause anaemia -- a reduction in the red blood cell numbers. This reduces the ability of blood to carry oxygen and makes the animal ill.

A protozoan referred to as _Theileria buffeli_ has been present in Australia for around 100 years. It has been seen occasionally in blood smears of cattle from "ticky" country, but seldom caused any illness. It was considered a benign infection.

Generally ticks are the carriers (vectors) responsible for spread of theileria throughout the world. In NSW, the bush tick (_Haemaphysalis longicornis_) is suspected to be responsible though other ticks could be involved. Small numbers (less than 10 ticks) are able to spread the infection. Many farmers on affected properties have not observed ticks on affected cattle. Experimentally lice and march flies have also been shown to transmit infection. Work is under way to better understand the means of spread in NSW.
