Additional patients in China under investigation for SARS; WHO team travels
to Beijing - update 2, 26 Apr 2004
---------------------------------------------------------
At the request of the Chinese Ministry of Health, WHO is today sending the
1st members of an international team to help investigate the source of SARS
cases recently reported in Beijing and the eastern province of Anhui. The
team, which is expected to begin work on Wednesday, will include experts in
epidemiology, virology, infection control, and laboratory biosafety.
Results of investigations to date point to laboratory research at the
National Institute of Virology in Beijing as the likely source of the
outbreak. The institute has been engaged in research with the SARS
coronavirus, including the development of a vaccine.
Two of the recently reported cases were conducting research at the
laboratory: a 26 year old female postgraduate student from Anhui Province,
and a 31 year old man. The dates of symptom onset in the 2 cases were
separated by 23 days, suggesting that more than one opportunity for
exposure may have occurred in the laboratory from mid-March through early
April 2004. Authorities have closed the virology institute and placed its
more than 200 employees under medical observation. Numerous environmental
samples from the laboratory have been taken to help assess possible sources
of contamination, and these samples will be shared with WHO.
Understanding and eliminating the source of infection are critical steps in
bringing the outbreak under control. An equally important activity is to
quickly detect all chains of transmission and interrupt them through rapid
case detection, tracing and follow-up of contacts, and infection control in
hospitals.
WHO is concerned about additional opportunities for exposure that may have
already occurred. Some patients were treated or assessed in several
different hospitals before a suspicion of SARS led to the introduction of
adequate precautionary measures, including isolation of patients and strict
procedures for infection control. One patient travelled a long distance
twice by train within China while symptomatic.
Chinese authorities have heightened surveillance and reporting for
SARS-like illness in health care facilities and have sent investigative
teams to Anhui Province.
Since 22 Apr 2004, China has reported that 8 people have been clinically
diagnosed as SARS cases or are under investigation for possible SARS
infection -- 6 in Beijing and 2, including the single fatality, in Anhui
Province. As of today, close to 1000 contacts of these cases are under
medical observation, including 640 in Beijing and 353 in Anhui.
The most recent cases, announced on Sunday, are 4 close contacts of a 20
year old nurse who treated the Anhui student at a Beijing hospital. The
cases -­ all in Beijing -­ are currently under investigation. They include
the nurses mother, father, aunt, and a woman who shared a hospital ward
with the nurse when she was undergoing treatment. Onset of symptoms for all
4 occurred between 16 and 19 Apr 2004. The nurses mother is in serious
condition following the development of pneumonia. The other 3 people are in
a stable condition.
In addition, health authorities have reported that 2 doctors who treated
the postgraduate student during her hospitalization in Hefai, Anhui, have
developed fever. A person in close contact with one of the doctors has also
developed fever.
To date, all diagnosed cases and cases under investigation have been linked
to chains of transmission involving close personal contact with an
identified case. There is no evidence of wider transmission in the community.

[In the past 24 hours since the last update (20040425.1150), there are the
additional reports of fever in 2 physicians treating the index case in
Anhui and in a close contact of one of these 2 physicians. According the
China Minstry of Health (MOH) website (<http://www.moh.gov.cn>), there has
been the implementation of increased surveillance for "atypical pneumonia"
country-wide, but no additional suspected cases have been identified.
As with 2003, there is an "outbreak" of newswire reports and speculations
on this current situation, and for this reason we have chosen to be highly
selective of newswire information we post, preferring to rely upon the
official reports available from WHO and the Chinese MOH. Lessons were
clearly learned after the 2003 outbreak, and there is now apparent
transparency in reporting. We will continue to screen newswire reports for
possible early introduction of probable SARS activity in new geographic
regions (outside of the currently identified Beijing and Anhui provinces),
including any possible international spread.
We are still awaiting information on the independent laboratory testing of
specimens from the currently identified cases in China. Until these results
are available, the cases are being classified as probable and suspected.
According to WHO guidelines for the global surveillance of SARS,
classification as a confirmed case at the start of an outbreak requires
independent verification of results by an external international reference
laboratory. Such procedures are considered necessary in view of the
implications that confirmed SARS cases can have for international public
health. Irrespective of the "tentative" classifications, appropriate
investigations and disease control measures have been implemented, under
the assumption that infection with SARS coronavirus has truly occurred.
Hence, it is a semantic discussion that will not delay appropriate control
measures to interrupt transmission.
From the information currently available, there is now evidence of 3
generations of transmission. The 1st generation involved the index case
from Anhui, and possibly a 2nd "1st-generation" case, the postdoctoral
student from Beijing whose onset of illness was 23 days after the onset of
illness of the index case from Anhui. The 2nd generation included the
mother of the index case from Anhui and the nurse who cared for the index
case from Anhui while she was hospitalized in Beijing, and possibly the
physicians who cared for her while hospitalized in Anhui. The 3rd
generation of cases are the family members of the nurse (from the 2nd
generation), a patient hospitalized in the same ward as the nurse before
SARS was identified as a possible diagnosis for the nurse's illness, and a
close contact of one of the physicians who treated the index patient in
Anhui. This pattern of nosocomial spread due to lack of early
identification of SARS as a possible diagnosis is very reminiscent of the
outbreak in 2003.
Concern about possible spread outside of the current identified "close
contact" circle around these cases is warranted. It is to be hoped that the
threshold for suspicion of possible SARS will be lowered country-wide, so
cases that may occur related to transmission while travelling on the trains
between Anhui Province and Beijing will be identified and isolated early,
preventing further generations of transmission.
In addition, there are appropriate concerns about laboratory safety
procedures. This is now the 3rd incident of SARS transmission within a
laboratory working on SARS research. The first 2 occurred in Singapore and
Taiwan (see ProMED-mail postings SARS - worldwide (185): Taiwan, probable
lab exposure 20031217.3081 and SARS - worldwide (174): Singapore laboratory
exposure 20030923.2397). Since the 2003 outbreak, it seems as though
laboratory exposure is a higher risk factor than the possible zoonotic
exposure. - Mod.MPP]
