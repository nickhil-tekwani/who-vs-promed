In response to ProMED-mail's request for "any relevant information and
assistance to the conservationists in Assam," Raja Varma has provided the
following note:
KFD [Kyasanur forest disease] has so far been reported only from southern
India, but this time of year (February-March) is when the
monkey-and-man-biting nymphs of the tick _Haemaphysalis spinigera_ are most
active. [It was not made clear whether the nymphs are equally active for
both Assam and Karnataka. The 2 states are located quite far apart from
each other, the former in the easternmost and the latter in the southern
part of the Indian Subcontinent. - Mod.RY]

14 golden langurs die in Chirang forests
----------------------------------------
Kokrajhar, Feb 25: 14 endangered golden langurs have perished following a
mysterious disease this year inside the Chirang reserve forest area at
Ultapani in Assam's Kokrajhar disrict.
Bablu Roy, director of a local NGO, Green Heart Nature Club, alleged that
the animals died due to disease causing concern among conservationists.He
appealed to the state and central governments to intervene as the Bodoland
Territorial Council, in which the Chirang forests exists, may not have the
expertise to deal with the crisis.
Chirang reserve forests and the Manas Tiger sanctuary boasts of having the
world's only golden langur population.
When contacted the state forest department sources said a probe would be
held to ascertain the truth and subsequent action will be taken.

[We appreciate the information above provided by Raja Varma. The clinical
picture of the illness responsible for these as yet undiagnosed deaths is
vague. Many infectious etiologies are possible. KFD is just one of the
viral diseases that is highly lethal for the local monkeys. Further
information from knowledgeable sources would be very much appreciated. - Mod.RY
We thank Professor Varma for this useful information relating to the
possibility that the deaths of the golden langurs (_Trachypithecus geei_)
might be caused by infection with the KFD virus. A very good account of the
epidemiology and ecology of KFD has been written by Raja Varma: Varma MGR.
