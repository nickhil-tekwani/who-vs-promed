The Greater Los Angeles Vector Control District is warning residents that mosquito season in the area is not over yet. Vector control officials are saying that aedes mosquitoes are being increasingly detected in more San Fernando Valley communities. These mosquitoes typically tend to strike during the day.

So far, no serious illnesses have been reported. But aedes mosquitoes can transmit viruses that cause Zika, dengue fever, chikungunya, and yellow fever [viruses].

Southern California is dealing with "a new normal" when it comes to mosquito activity, said Kelly Middleton with the Greater Los Angeles Vector Control Department. "These are the same mosquitoes that make the summers miserable in the southeast United States. There is no magic bullet to get rid of them, and control is extremely difficult unless everyone works together to remove standing water from around homes, schools, businesses, and public areas," [he said].

[The species of aedes mosquito is not mentioned in the report above. It could be _Ae. aegypti_ or _Ae. albopictus_, or both. Both have been found in southern California and have been turning up in new locations there. As the report above states, there has been no local transmission of dengue, chikungunya, or Zika viruses in the California areas where these mosquitoes have been found. These viruses have been imported into southern California by infected individuals, but without ongoing transmission, perhaps because the populations of these vectors is not sufficiently abundant to make that likely. - Mod.TY
