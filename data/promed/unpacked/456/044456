In the village of Serafimovsky, Tuymazinsky district of Bashkiria, there was an outbreak of mouse fever among people. This was reported on the website of the regional department of Rospotrebnadzor.

The federal service noted an increase in the incidence of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). They emphasized that since the beginning of November [2022], doctors in the village had made a preliminary diagnosis of HFRS in 31 people, including 14 children.

"According to the preliminary data of the epidemiological investigation, predominantly family foci prevail. The Office of Rospotrebnadzor in the Republic of Bashkortostan has organized a set of anti-epidemic measures in the locality and at the place of residence and education of children in educational institutions," the Rospotrebnadzor website says.

HFRS is an acute viral disease that is accompanied by high fever, general intoxication, bleeding tendency, and kidney damage. The incubation period of the disease lasts from 10 to 45 days, the first signs of mouse fever are a sharp rise in temperature, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, and sleep disturbance.

The lethality of HFRS in the Far East reaches 68%, and in the European part of Russia - 1-3.5%. Sometimes the lethality of the virus can rise up to 10%.

Earlier, in the Ermakovsky district of the Krasnoyarsk Territory, quarantine was introduced due to the detection of trichinosis, a deadly parasite that is dangerous for animals and people, in the carcass of a bear. Because of this, it was forbidden to hold fairs, exhibitions, and events related to the movement of animals in the Aradan village council.

[Mouse fever is a local name for tick-borne encephalitis. The report notes that in people this disease can cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). Tickborne encephalitis (TBE) virus infections in Russia are common. This is the end of the season of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus transmission in Russia, and tick bites have been very common in Buryat this year (2022) and apparently in the Republic of Bashkortostan as well, as indicated in the above report by the increase in HFRS cases. No mention was made in the above report if the TBE virus-infected individuals had been vaccinated against the virus.

TBE is caused by the TBE virus, an RNA virus that belongs to the genus _Flavivirus_ and is closely related to the Powassan virus. TBEV has 3 subtypes: European, Siberian, and Far Eastern. The above report does not indicate which TBEV variant is involved in the above outbreak, but since the Republic of Bashkortostan is in European Russia, the European subtype seems most likely. TBEV is transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected tick of the _Ixodes_ species, primarily _I. ricinus_ (in Europe) or _I. persulcatus_ (in Siberia and Far Eastern Russia). Ticks are both vector and virus reservoirs, and small rodents are the primary amplifying host. TBE can also be acquired by ingesting unpasteurized dairy products (e.g., milk and cheese) from infected goats, sheep, or cows. TBEV transmission has been infrequently reported during laboratory exposure and slaughtering of viremic animals, and direct person-to-person transmission, through blood transfusion and breastfeeding. (CDC; https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2020/travel-related-infectious-diseases/tickborne-encephalitis).

The CDC information notes that in Russia, 2 inactivated TBE vaccines are available: TBE-Moscow (Chumakov Institute, Russia) and EnceVir (Microgen, Russia). The European and Russian vaccines should provide cross-protection against all 3 TBEV subtypes. Vaccine failures have been reported, particularly in people aged over 50 years. It is curious that no vaccination of people resident in or visiting the areas of high tick abundance is mentioned. - Mod.TY
