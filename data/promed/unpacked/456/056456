Study Identifies Mutations Needed For Human Bird Flu Pandemic
-----------------------------------------------
Scientists said on Thu [16 Mar 2006] they had identified some of the
mutations that the H5N1 avian influenza virus needs to gain a permanent
foothold in the human population, causing a greatly feared pandemic. They
said the test they used, called a glycan microarray [see ProMED-mail post:
Influenza virus: receptor specificities 20051222.3658] might be useful in
monitoring the virus in birds and as it infects people, to see whether it
is mutating into a form that would allow it to pass easily from person to
person.
H5N1 has moved steadily across Asia and into Europe since it reappeared in
2003, and has picked up speed in recent weeks. It has killed just over 100
people but remains mostly a virus of birds. No one can predict when, or
even whether, it will evolve into a form that transmits easily from one
person to another, but fears are that it will. Scientists have been
examining the virus when they can get samples and trying to predict just
which changes are needed to make it change from a bird-specific to a
human-specific form.
Ian Wilson and a team at The Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla,
California looked at a structure on the surface of all influenza viruses
called hemagglutinin. It is the "H" in H5N1, and there are 16 known types
of hemagglutinin. Only 3 -- H1, H2 and H3 -- have been known to cause human
disease, and they caused the last 3 great influenza pandemics in 1918, 1957
and 1968. Working with flu experts Terence Tumpey of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta and Jeffery Taubenberger of the
Armed Forces Institute of Pathology in Rockville, Maryland, Wilson's team
dissected and imaged a sample of influenza virus that killed a 10-year-old
Vietnamese boy in 2004. They found its hemagglutinin looked very similar to
the virus that caused the 1918 pandemic, which killed anywhere between 50
million and 100 million people. It looked less similar to H5N1 taken from a
duck in Singapore.
"Of the H5N1 viral isolates studied to date, A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (Viet04)
is among the most pathogenic in mammalian models, such as ferrets and
mice," the researchers wrote in their report, published in the journal
Science. Hemagglutinin allows the virus to attach to the cells it infects,
and it has to be able to grapple a structure called sialic acid, which is
slightly different in different animal species. So to pass from birds to
humans, the virus must mutate enough to allow it to bind to, for instance,
both a human lung cell and a chicken's intestinal cell.
Wilson's team identified a structure that, in the human configuration, is
called an alpha 2-6 receptor and in birds an alpha 2-3 receptor. It must
change from the bird to human configuration, they found, to cause human
epidemics. This "critical step ... appears to be one of the reasons why
most avian influenza viruses, including current avian H5 strains, are not
easily transmitted from human-to-human following avian to human infection,"
they wrote. Earlier studies had shown it took only 2 changes to make the
1918 virus look just like a purely avian virus. That may suggest it may not
take much mutation to change a bird virus into a human pandemic strain.
The [glycan microarray] test may help monitor for these changes, Wilson
said. "This test that you can do for receptor testing specificity, this
glycan array, is something you could possibly think about using in the
field," Wilson said. So if the virus has not mutated yet, why does it ever
infect people? "It's not an all or nothing," Wilson said. "It's a
preference. At higher doses, doses that normally you and I wouldn't pass
the virus on to one another ... you can overcome this (species) barrier."

The paper is entitled: "Structure and Receptor Specificity of the
Hemagglutinin from an H5N1 Influenza Virus." The authors are James Stevens,
Ola Blixt, Terrence M. Tumpey, Jeffery K. Taubenberger, James C. Paulson,
and Ian A. Wilson. The introduction reads as follows:
"The hemagglutinin (HA) structure at 2.9 angstrom resolution, from a highly
pathogenic Vietnamese H5N1 influenza virus, is more related to the 1918 and
other human H1 HAs than to a 1997 duck H5 HA. Glycan microarray analysis of
this Viet04 HA reveals an avian a'2-3 sialic acid receptor binding
preference. Introduction of mutations that can convert H1 serotype HAs to
human a'2-6 receptor specificity only enhanced or reduced affinity for
avian-type receptors. However, mutations that can convert avian H2 and H3
HAs to human receptor specificity, when inserted onto the Viet04 H5 HA
framework, permitted binding to a natural human a'2-6 glycan, which
suggests a path for this H5N1 virus to gain a foothold in the human
population." - Mod.CP]

[2] Putative role of the NS1 non-structural protein

Clues to the Virulence of H5N1 viruses in Humans
-----------------------------------------------
A perspectives article by Robert Krug in the 17 Mar 2006 issue of Science
discusses other recent evidence relating to determination of H5N1 virus
virulence for mammals; namely, the role of the non-structural NS1 protein.
The following are extracts from this article, which should be consulted for
additional information and a more comprehensive account of the current
status of research identifying determinants of virulence for mammalian hosts.
Several virus-encoded proteins likely contribute to virulence in humans,
because previous studies have shown that the virulence of influenza A virus
isolated from different organisms is caused by multiple genes. A study by
Obenauer et al. (see: J. C. Obenauer et al., Science 311, 1576 (2006),
published online on 26 Jan 2006) presents evidence suggesting that the
virulence of H5N1 viruses may be caused at least in part by the function of
a previously unnoticed amino acid sequence motif in the virus-encoded
nonstructural protein called NS1.
The NS1 protein is synthesized in infected cells but not incorporated into
virus particles. Rather, this small, multi-functional protein participates
in both protein-RNA and protein-protein interactions during infection. Its
amino-terminal RNA-binding domain binds to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) with
low affinity, but the significance of this activity during viral infection
is controversial. The NS1 protein also binds and inhibits the function of 2
cellular proteins that are required for the modification of the 3'- ends of
cellular messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Consequently, the production of a key
component of the host antiviral response, interferon-beta mRNA, is
substantially reduced, although not eliminated. The NS1 sequences that
participate in binding to either these 2 cellular proteins or dsRNA are not
part of the putative new virulence determinant in NS1.
Other virulence determinant for the H5N1 virus in mammals that have been
identified previously include the amino acid at position 627 of the PB2
component of the viral polymerase. This residue is lysine in mouse-virulent
strains and glutamic acid in non-virulent strains. The role of basic amino
acids adjacent to the cleavage site of the hemagglutinin protein is well
known and is a diagnostic feature for the HPAI phenotype in poultry.
To further understand the molecular basis of virulence, Obenauer et al. 1st
sequenced the genes of a large number of H5N1 viruses isolated from wild
birds and poultry. Their analysis revealed not only the expected
variability in the sequences of the 2 major surface proteins of the virus,
hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, but also variability in the sequence of
the NS1 protein.
It was observed that the carboxyl terminus of the NS1 proteins of the vast
majority of avian H5N1 viruses contains a sequence motif, Glu-Ser-Glu-Val
(ESEV). These residues are predicted to mediate binding to [human] proteins
bearing a region called a PDZ domain. The multitude of human proteins that
contain a PDZ domain function in diverse cellular signaling pathways,
including those that regulate protein traffic within the cell and those
that maintain cell morphology and organization. Another PDZ-binding
sequence, Glu-Pro-Glu-Val (EPEV), was identified at the carboxyl terminus
of the NS1 proteins of all the virulent H5N1 viruses isolated from humans.
In contrast, the carboxyl terminus of the NS1 proteins of low-virulence
human influenza A usually contains a different sequence, Arg-Ser-Lys-Val
(RSKV), which is not a PDZ-binding motif. Furthermore, Obenauer et al.
verified that the carboxyl-terminal ESEV and EPEV sequences indeed bind to
PDZ domains. Consequently, the presence of a functional carboxyl-terminal
PDZ-binding domain in the NS1 protein of H5N1 viruses correlates with human
virulence, supporting the authors hypothesis that the carboxyl-terminal
domain of the NS1 proteins of avian H5N1 viruses acts as a virulence
determinant by binding cellular PDZ-containing proteins and disrupting
their participation in important cellular processes.
Further extensive analyses will be required to substantiate these novel data.
