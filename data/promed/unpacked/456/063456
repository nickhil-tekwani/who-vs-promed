African swine fever, Georgia
----------------------------
Information received on (and dated) 5 Jun 2007, from Dr Levan Ramishvili,
chairman of the Veterinary Union, Veterinary Union, Ministry of
Agriculture, Tbilisi, Georgia
Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Start date: 22 Apr 2007
Date of confirmation of event: 5 Jun 2007
Date submitted to OIE: 6 Jun 2007
Reason for notification: first occurrence of a listed disease
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: -
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
Report pertains to: entire country
New outbreaks
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 11
[The outbreaks below are listed in their usual format at the source link
given above. Since the only information given in each of the 11 outbreaks
was the number of animals destroyed, I have collapsed the report by giving
the number destroyed in parenthesis for each of the 11 specific outbreak
sites. We hope the details, which determine mortality and case fatality
rates will follow shortly. - Mod.PC]

Outbreak statistics
Species: swine
Apparent morbidity rate: --
Apparent mortality rate: --
Apparent case fatality rate: --
Proportion susceptible removed*: --
* Removed from the susceptible population either through death,
destruction, or slaughter
Epidemiology
Source of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: on 17 May [2007], Georgia notified to the OIE the
occurrence of several outbreaks attributed to post weaning multisystemic
wasting syndrome due to porcine circovirus type 2. On 4 Jun 2007, the OIE
Reference Laboratory, Pirbright, United Kingdom, confirmed, using gold
standard tests, on received samples, the presence of African swine fever virus.
A total of 20 000 susceptible pigs were destroyed in 10 regions all over
the country. Animals were in villages and private farms.
Control measures
Measures already applied
- movement control inside the country
- disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s)
- dipping / spraying
- quarantine
- stamping out
- vaccination permitted
- no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied
None specified
Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Pirbright Laboratory, United Kingdom (OIE
Reference Laboratory)
Species: swine
Test: enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
Test date: 4 Jun 2007
Result: positive
Species: swine
Test: pathogen isolation on cell culture
Test date: 4 Jun 2007

[This is really a stunning event in animal health. African swine fever
(ASF) is a serious disease causing high mortality in susceptible swine
populations and control is usually effected by depopulation of infected
and/or exposed swine. In and of itself, this fact is no surprise and
finding this disease in African countries is not a surprise.
To have the disease in an area so distant from Africa, however, right on
the eastern shores of the Black Sea, represents quite a large geographic jump.
The disease reportedly started on 22 Apr 2007, when it was misdiagnosed as
PMWS (post weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome). The outbreaks were
reported to OIE on 15 May 2007, as an emergency disease (see the report,
pertaining to mapped 5 foci at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=5457>.
A strikingly rather reminiscent situation has recently been reported from 2
Asian countries, China and Viet Nam. In China, an emerging disease in swine
has been causing severe losses since mid-2006. It was initially denominated
as "swine high fever disease" (SHFD), attributed to a multifactorial
etiology, and later to PRRS (porcine reproductive and respiratory
syndrome). The disease in Viet Nam, diagnosed as PRRS, was reported to OIE
on 10 and 19 Apr 2007.
On 15 May 2007, ProMED-mail published the following observation on SHFD in
China, received from Peter Roeder: "I wonder if anyone has included African
swine fever [ASF] in diagnostic investigations of the syndrome. It is not
only clinically and pathologically virtually indistinguishable from
classical swine fever but has a demonstrated record of ability to spread
globally. China has a strong and increasing presence in Africa, where the
disease is widespread, and it is not beyond the realm of possibility that a
returning worker could have brought back some infected pork -- as happened
in Belgium some years ago". ProMED-mail recommended the inclusion of tests
against ASF in several subsequent postings on the Chinese "undiagnosed
disease". The current finding in Georgia, and the similarity of clinical
observations, justifies the inclusion of tests against ASF in China and
Viet Nam.
Finally, please note that the outbreak is spread all over Georgia and
involves 11 swine operations that are widely separated geographically. A
map of the outbreak distribution is displayed at the end of the OIE report
referenced above. - Mods.PC/AS]
