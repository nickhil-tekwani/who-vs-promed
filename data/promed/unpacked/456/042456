Dutch to extend animal vaccination to fight Q fever
---------------------------------------------------
Dutch farms, children's farms and zoos holding more than 50 goats or
sheep will have to vaccinate the animals against a highly infectious
disease known as Q fever, the Dutch Agriculture Ministry said on
Saturday [26 Sep 2009].

Q fever is caused by a bacterium that is transmitted by goats and
sheep to humans. Since 2007 human cases of the disease have risen
sharply in the Netherlands to more than 2000 in 2009, according to
the National Institute for Public Health on its website. The illness
causes flu-like symptoms treatable with antibiotics, but can in rare
cases be fatal. 5 people have so far died from Q-fever.

This year only farmers in parts of the southern provinces of
Noord-Brabant, Limburg and Gelderland had to vaccinate their animals.

"The ultimate goal is to force back the amount of human cases of
Q-fever," Agricultural Minister Gerda Verburg wrote in a letter to
parliament [see item 2, below].

The Ministry will make 1.5 million vaccinations available.

Q fever
-------
In addition to the letter of 28 Aug 2009 (2008-2009 Parliamentary
paper: 28 286), I provide you, also on behalf of Minister [of Health]
Klink, the following information on the state of matters relating to
the new approach addressing Q fever. The new approach is aimed at
maintaining the freedom from Q fever of those dairy goats and sheep
farms throughout the Netherlands not yet infected, and the
rehabilitation of the Q fever-infected farms.

We assume that by addressing the main sources of infection in sheep
and goats, the Q-fever epidemic in humans is to be controlled.

Bulk tank milk monitoring
------------------------
Starting 1 Oct 2009, holders of more than 50 dairy goats or sheep
will be obliged to participate in the Q-fever monitoring. For this
purpose, each farm will be sampled once in 2 months for Q-fever
testing. Suspected/positive samples will be forwarded for
confirmatory testing to the Central Veterinary Institute (CVI). If
confirmed, those farms will be declared infected.

Measures applied in infected farms
----------------------------------
Hygienic measures:

Pending the outcome of the ongoing investigation into improved manure
handling procedures, the current, published measures are to be
maintained. This means that throughout the lambing season and up to
30 days after its termination, no manure is permitted to be mucked
out. The spread of manure in the fields will be allowed only after
additional 90 days of storage under cover.

- Exit of animals:
Animals are not allowed exit to other farms for milk production or breeding.
The transportation of animals to slaughterhouses is permitted.
Animals under the age of 4 weeks are allowed transportation to fattening units.

- Introduction of animals:
Infected farms are allowed to introduce only vaccinated animals from
Q fever-free farms.

- Visits ban:
No visitors are allowed on infected premises.

- Vaccination:
Infected farms must vaccinate all their animals.

Measures applied in free holdings:
------------------------------------
- There are no restrictions upon the handling/use of manure, or upon
exit of animals from free holdings.

- Introduction of animals is allowed only from Q fever-free holdings.

- Vaccination: Free holdings should be vaccinated.

Policy regarding the fate of infected farms:
-------------------------------------------
Infected Dairy goats and sheep farms may regain their free status
after a year of negative bi-monthly bulk tank milk test results. This
period is relatively long due to uncertainties concerning the pattern
of excretion of the Q-fever pathogen and the role thereupon of the
lambing season.

Pilot studies, aiming at the identification of additional measures to
obtain early eradication of the disease on infected farms, have been
undertaken by the CVI and the Animal Health Service (GD).

Manure treatment:
----------------
As stated in the letter of 28 Aug 2009, industrial composting of
manure was to be experimentally investigated as an alternative to its
incineration. Meanwhile, a request to carry out such investigation
has been received from the province Zuid-Holland. This research is
being addressed by the CVI and the Animal Science Group. The results
of this investigation is expected before the next lambing season.

Vaccination Campaign 2010:
-------------------------
During 2010, vaccination will be compulsory throughout the
Netherlands, including all holdings of more than 50 sheep or dairy
goats, all animals on children's farms, care farms and zoos.
Vaccination will be also compulsory in wandering sheep flocks, in
nature reserves and on farms holding lamb petting days. In other
sheep and goat holdings, vaccination will be voluntary.

The number of available vaccine doses is sufficient for the
vaccination of all the above described holdings. For the vaccination
campaign of 2010, 1.5 million doses of vaccine are available, of
which 100 000 doses are to be delivered in November 2009. The rest of
the vaccine doses will become available during 2010. The precise
delivery schedule is still being negotiated with the vaccine
manufacturer. We strive, of course, for the earliest possible
delivery.

[According to the figures of the Dutch National Institute for Public
Health and the Environment (RIVM), the number of human infections
with Q fever, since the start of this epidemic in mid 2007, is 3313
(2007: N=168, 2008: N=1000, 2009: N=2145). Out of the 2145 cases
reported so far during 2009, 2047 have been laboratory confirmed, 98
suspected; 5 died. An epicurve can be seen at

Further data, including an outbreak map, graphics, 'Information for
professionals' and several presentations on the disease in man and
animal (in Dutch), are available at

The Dutch Q fever outbreak is the largest of its kind on record. - Mod.AS].
