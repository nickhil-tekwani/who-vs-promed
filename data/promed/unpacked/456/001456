["Pullorum disease of chickens is a bacterial infection caused by _Salmonella enterica_ subsp. _enterica_ serovar Gallinarum biovar Pullorum (_Salmonella_ Pullorum). At this time the serovar is referred to as Gallinarum in some parts of the world and Pullorum in others; in this chapter the serovar will be referred to as Gallinarum or Pullorum according to the biovar under discussion as this is more meaningful from a clinical and epidemiological perspective.

"In its acute form, Pullorum disease is almost exclusively a septicaemic disease of young chickens. However, the organism may also be associated with disease in turkey poults and may be carried subclinically or lead to reduced egg production and hatchability, plus a range of atypical signs in older birds. Ovarian transmission is a major route by which the organism can spread. Game birds and "backyard" poultry flocks may act as reservoirs of infection, and wild birds may act as vectors for the organism and as such are important in the epidemiology of the disease.

"Fowl typhoid in chickens and turkeys is caused by _S._ Gallinarum biovar Gallinarum and is more often observed in the later growing period and in mature stock. Disease is often characterised by rapid spread with high morbidity and acute or subacute mortality. Red mites may be involved in the transmission of disease and persistence in poultry houses.

"Clinical signs in chicks and poults include anorexia, diarrhoea, dehydration, weakness, and death. In mature birds, Pullorum disease is less severe but decreased egg production, poor hatchability, and some increased mortality may occur. Fowl typhoid is a more acute septicaemic condition that mainly affects mature birds and may be particularly severe in commercial laying flocks."

"_Salmonella_ Gallinarum and _S._ Pullorum rarely cause clinical cases in people. In one report, these organisms accounted for only 26 out of more than 450 000 salmonella isolated from humans in the US between 1982 and 1992. Self-limiting enteritis is thought to be the commonest presentation, although other syndromes have been reported. Their threat to immunocompromised individuals is still unclear. A urinary tract infection caused by _S._ Gallinarum was reported in a kidney transplant patient in 2017, and it is possible that some infections might have been missed. Organisms identified only as group D salmonella have occasionally been recovered from people who were infected with HIV or had other immunosuppressive conditions."
