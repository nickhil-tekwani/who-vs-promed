The posting by Dr Joshi from Nepal brings up an important issue about Post
Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) for Rabies. The case of the 32 year lady from
New Hampshire who died of Rabies (MMWR 1997, Vol. 46(12), pp. 267-270),
when she did not take the rabies vaccine offered to her at Sydney, five
days after she was bitten by a dog in Nepal. The patient had reportedly
received conflicting information from other sources regarding her risk for
Rabies and the benefits of PEP after the delay between exposure and
treatment. She elected not to return to the hospital in Sydney for
treatment (NSW Public Health Bulletin 1997, Vol. 8(4).
This brings up two issues:
1. The public (including medical staff in developed countries) have
incomplete and conflicting information regarding PEP in Rabies. Education
about this 'killer' disease certainly needs to be 'boosted'.
2. Clinicians dealing with cases either in developing countries or in
returned travelers in developed countries should take a careful exposure
history and where there is doubt, should seek advice from local Public
Health Units. Brief information about Rabies should also be included in
pre-travel consultation especially when travel to endemic areas is planned.
The last point we also need to remember and remind everyone concerned is
that Rabies or similar viruses are not restricted to dogs in the street.
It is also seen in other animals in the wild (foxes etc) and also in
various varieties of bats (Lyssa virus).
