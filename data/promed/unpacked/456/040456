Diet enacts special law on foot-and-mouth disease
-------------------------------------------------
The Diet [Japan's bicameral legislature] on Friday [28 May 2010]
enacted a special law to allow the central government to forcibly
slaughter livestock to prevent the spread of foot and mouth disease
(FMD), as the House of Councillors unanimously approved the proposed
legislation at its plenary session.

The new law on measures against FMD is expected to be promulgated
next week [week of 31 May - 4 Jun 2010] and take effect immediately
in the face of the rapid spread of the contagious ailment among
livestock in Miyazaki Prefecture, southwestern Japan. The House of
Representatives approved the bill Thursday [27 May 2010].

Meanwhile, Miyazaki Gov. Hideo Higashikokubaru said Friday [28 May
2010] that 2 of the 49 stud bulls, which the prefectural government
had asked the state to exempt from slaughter, have begun to show
symptoms of the disease such as excessive salivation and fever.

All 49 stud bulls will be slaughtered soon, Higashikokubaru said at a
meeting of the Miyazaki prefectural assembly.

The new law will allow the agriculture, forestry and fisheries
minister [MAFF] and prefectural governor to slaughter even healthy
livestock in an area designated by the minister, as the disease is
rapidly spreading and cannot be contained by conventional
countermeasures.

It also states that the government should compensate farmers for
slaughtered livestock and establish a fund for local economic
revitalization.

The expected funding requirement when the legislation takes effect,
such as the cost of burying slaughtered livestock and financial
support for farmers, is estimated to be about 100 billion yen [1.1011
billion U.S. dollars].

Welcoming the new legislation, farm minister Hirotaka Akamatsu told a
press conference that he will visit Miyazaki Prefecture on Sunday [30
May 2010] to explain the legislation to the local people.

As the special legislation will be effective until March 2012, the
government plans to drastically revise a relevant law on contagious
diseases involving livestock by the deadline.

Re: Foot & mouth disease - Japan (16): (MZ) update (item 1, Japan's
follow-up report No 6)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just to make a small correction to the moderator's comment regarding
"vaccination to cull" [The comment was: "The "vaccination to cull"
currently applied in Japan, meant to enable completion of stamping
out while preventing virus spread, is a unique, novel procedure which
is not included among the control measures described in OIE's
International Animal Health Code].

"Vaccination to cull" is in fact mentioned as an option in the OIE
Terrestrial Animal Health Code, article 8.5.45, point 2 [A file was
attached].

[Prof Willeberg's corrective observation is fully and gratefully acknowledged.

Indeed, as he indicated, OIE's code includes, in article 8.5.45., the
following strategy to eradicate FMD virus infection following an
outbreak (point 2 out of 4 recognised strategies); see at
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/mcode/en_chapitre_1.8.5.htm>):

"2. slaughter of all clinically affected and in-contact susceptible
animals and vaccination of at-risk animals, with subsequent slaughter
of vaccinated animals." Japan regards, apparently, all susceptible
animals within a 10 km zone around each outbreak as at-risk,
therefore vaccinated.

According to article 8.5.8. ("Recovery of free status"), an FMD free
country or zone, where vaccination is not practised (such as Japan),
can apply for the reinstatement of its freedom from FMD, "3 months
after the slaughter of all vaccinated animals where a stamping-out
policy, emergency vaccination and serological surveillance are
applied in accordance with Articles 8.5.40. to 8.5.46."
