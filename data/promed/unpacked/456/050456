Japan's agriculture ministry said on Sunday [9 Sep 2018] it had confirmed the country's 1st outbreak of swine fever in 26 years and suspended exports of pork and wild boar meat.

The fever, a different kind from the African swine fever that has broken out in China, was found in a farm in central Japan's Gifu city, the ministry said.

[Classical] swine fever [CSF] occurs among pigs and wild boar, and is not infectious to humans, the ministry said in a statement.

African swine fever was detected in China in early August [2018] and has been found in 18 farms or abattoirs in 6 provinces, according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).

The FAO said last week it [ASF] was almost certain to spread from China to other Asian countries.

[According to a press release of Japan's Ministry of Agriculture, dated 9 Sep 2018, in Japanese, the affected farm in Gifu city included, when the assessment was made following the death of a single fattening pig, 79 breeding and 531 fattening pigs. On 8 Sep 2018, the diagnosis of CSF was made at the national agricultural research institute (Animal health research division), where African swine fever was excluded; (Thanks to Sabine Zentis for the submission; available at http://www.maff.go.jp/j/press/syouan/douei/180909_32.html).

Japan's last CSF outbreak was reported in 1992, as indicated in OIE's WAHIS interface. According to the said source, the disease is reportable in Japan, and its prescribed disease control measures include stamping-out policy and vaccination prohibition.

The very early detection of this event may be partially due to the high alertness in Japan in response to the alarming ASF epizootic in China. Available information on the source of infection and epidemiological statistics are expected in the due official OIE notification.

The FAO convened from 5-7 Sep 2018 an "Emergency Regional Consultation on African Swine Fever Risk reduction and preparedness" in Bangkok. The consultation's objectives were:

1. Review the ASF situation and risks to the rest of China and the region;
2. Develop a regional approach for ASF risk reduction, preparedness and response;
3. Identify priority actions required for countries in a short, medium and longer term; and
4. Facilitate the development of a stakeholder network for ASF.

Conclusions and decisions obtained will be published if/when they become available. - Mod.AS
