There has been a suspected case of anthrax in Norwegian cattle. The Norwegian Veterinary Institute received a sample from a dead animal on a farm in Trondelag.

Preliminary examination suggested the animal was negative for anthrax, but the institute is awaiting further research to debunk or confirm their suspicions.

The disease was last detected by Norwegian authorities in cattle in 1993. The Norwegian Food Safety Authority is responsible for handling cases of illness in the country under the Food Act.

[The last livestock case of anthrax was in 1993, a single bovine, and prior to that, another singleton in 1990, so the chance that this case may be anthrax is slim, though this brief report fails to indicate what triggered their suspicions. Wild speculation would suggest the case followed upon the disturbance of an old anthrax cattle grave, but cattle die of many other commoner conditions than just anthrax, such as black quarter or blackleg due to _Clostridium chauvoei_, but clinical confusion is unlikely. The last human case of human anthrax was in 2000 in a heroin addict.

Trondelag is a region central Norway made up of 2 counties, Nord-Trondelag and Sor-Trondelag. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tr%C3%B8ndelag. - Mod.MHJ
