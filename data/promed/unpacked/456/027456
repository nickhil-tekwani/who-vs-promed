[see
Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome - Canada (Ontario)]
The officially recognized number of cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome
(HPS) in Canada stands at 20, including 12 from Alberta, six from British
Columbia, and two from Saskatchewan. The suspect case from Ontario remains
just that, a suspect case. My lab did report some preliminary results that
agreed with Dr. Kang's finding of hantavirus RNA in lung tisssue of the
patient
but some elements still make us very uncomfortable. These include some
clinical and pathological findings that are atypical for patients with HPS,
negative immunohistochemistry and less compelling but still relevant
considerations such as time of onset (February) and lack of any clearly
defined rodent exposure.
We intend to try to amplify other regions of the virus genome from the
patient's tissue as well as to look at other tissues beyond lung tissue.
Should these tissues be PCR positive, we will request more
immunohistochemistry tests. Unfortunately the only clinical specimens
available to us are
formalin-fixed,paraffin-embedded tissues which makes our job all the more
difficult.
We have found hantavirus-infected deer mice across Canada from British
Columbia to Newfoundland and genotyping of these strains indicates a
relatedness of the strains from Sin Nombre in the west to Sin Nombre-like
viruses in the east with a gradual differences seen as one moves across the
country. My colleague
Dr. Mike Drebot will present these findings at the American Society for
Tropical and Medicine and Hygiene meeting in [Orlando] Florida on December
9th. It is for this reason that I stated I would be very surprised to find
Convict Creek virus in Ontario.

[Thanks for the concise up-date, Harvey. This provides a far different
view than that afforded by the original report, in which it was stated that
Dr. Artsob doubted Dr. Kang's results. -- Mod CHC]
