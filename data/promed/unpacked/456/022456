Feed in Mad Cow Investigation is Traced to 2 Mills in Canada
---------------------
Canadian officials have traced to 2 mills the feed that probably caused
North America's 2 cases of mad cow disease, one in Canada in May 2003 and
the other in the United States in December 2003.
The feed from the Canadian mills could have contained infectious protein
from imported British cattle, said Dr. George Luterbach, an official of a
mad cow working group in the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA).
Canadian law prohibits disclosing the identity of the mills, Dr. Luterbach
said.
Canada reported its only case of the disease, also known as bovine
spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE., in an animal on a farm in Alberta. The
United States followed with an announcement that a cow in Mabton,
Washington, had the disease. Both animals had been raised on farms in
Alberta, and both ate feed containing meat and bone meal while they were
calves.
"Our best hypothesis was the animals were exposed by contaminated feed,"
Dr. Luterbach said. He said the 2 infected animals did not eat feed from
the same mill.
In both cases, the feed was presumably given to the animals as calves just
before Canada and the United States banned the use of cattle tissues in
feed intended for cattle in 1997. Paperwork showed that both mills went on
to comply with the feed restrictions, the agency said in issuing the
conclusions of its 10-month investigation.
Dr. Luterbach said the feed could have contained tissue from infected
cattle imported from Britain before Canada banned the importation of
British cattle after an outbreak of mad cow disease there.
Canadian investigators had performed mad cow tests on all they could find
of the 192 British cattle imported to Canada from 1980 to 1989, when Canada
banned such imports, Dr. Luterbach said. The investigators followed the
cattle until 1993, but could not find 68 animals that died or were culled,
he said. Protein from those animals could have been processed into feed, he
said.
"One or a small number may have had BSE.," Dr. Luterbach said. The feed
would have been shipped in large batches to individual farms and consumed
in about a week, he said, and would not have been widely distributed.

[Although the US and Canada put feed bans into place, the important issue
is: are they being enforced? The feed ban is being enforced on the large,
commercial feed manufacturers, but what about the private individual who
can mix his own commodities?
There is concern over diversion of prohibited materials into cattle feed.
Various agencies have not taken a stand on this issue, and it appears the
feed ban is not as comprehensive as it could be.
The international team commented that the USA needed to tighten up the feed
ban, and allowing private manufacturers to slip through the cracks does not
appear to move toward that recommendation. - Mod.TG]
