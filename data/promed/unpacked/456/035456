Epidemiological update: diphtheria
----------------------------------
Between epidemiological week (EW) 1 [31 Dec 2017-6 Jan 2018] and EW 49 [2 Dec-8 Dec 2018] of 2018, 3 countries in the region of the Americas (Colombia, Haiti, and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) have reported confirmed cases of diphtheria. In Haiti and Venezuela, the outbreaks are ongoing.

The following is a summary of the epidemiological situation in these countries:

Colombia
--------
In Colombia: 8 confirmed cases, including 3 deaths, were reported this year [2018]; however, since July 2018, no additional cases of diphtheria have been reported.

Haiti
-----
In Haiti: between EW 51 [14 Dec-20 Dec] of 2014 and EW 49 [2 Dec-8 Dec] of 2018, 774 probable cases were reported, including 105 deaths; of these, 261 were confirmed (254 by laboratory criteria and 7 by epidemiological link) (see table 1 at the source URL).

The number of probable cases reported in 2018 is higher than the total number of cases reported in 2017 and 2016 -- an increase that is attributed to greater sensitivity of the national surveillance system. The case fatality rate among cases confirmed by laboratory or epidemiological link was 23% in 2015, 39% in 2016, 8% in 2017, and 15% in 2018.

In 2018, there were 362 probable cases reported (between EW 1 and EW 49), including 96 confirmed cases (91 by laboratory and 5 by epidemiological link). During the same period, there were 28 deaths reported (14 confirmed by laboratory or epidemiological link, 8 with no viable laboratory samples, 5 that remain under investigation, and one that was discarded).

Among confirmed cases in 2018, the highest incidence is observed in the age group of 6-14 year olds, followed by 1-5 year olds. The majority of deaths (63%) occurred among those aged 6-14 years, followed by 1-5 year olds.

In 2018, the highest cumulative incidences per 100 000 population were reported in the municipalities of Gros-Morne, Artibonite Department (19.9), Valliere, Nord-Est Department (17), La Victoire, Nord Department (9.5), and Cerca-Carvajal (12.9), Thomonde (9.7), and Savanette (8.3) in Centre Department.

Venezuela
---------
In Venezuela: the diphtheria outbreak that began in July 2016 continues (see figure 2 at the source URL). Since the beginning of the outbreak until EW 48 of 2018, a total of 2360 suspected cases were reported (324 cases in 2016, 1040 in 2017, and 996 in 2018); of these, 1310 were confirmed. A total of 238 deaths were reported (17 in 2016, 103 in 2017, and 118 in 2018 [see ref. 2 at the source URL]); 345 cases were discarded in 2018. The case fatality rate was 18.2% in 2016, 13% in 2017, and 21% in 2018.

In 2016, cases were reported in 5 [Venezuelan] states (Anzoategui, Bolivar, Delta Amacuro, Monagas, and Sucre), while in 2017, cases were reported in 22 states and the Capital District. In 2018, 22 federal entities and 99 municipalities have reported confirmed cases. Cases have been reported among all age groups, but the most affected age group is 1-39 years, among whom the highest incidence is reported among 11-39 year olds. In EW 48 of 2018, there were 17 federal entities and 35 municipalities affected; accordingly, vaccination and control activities continue to be implemented.
