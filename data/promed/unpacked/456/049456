An outbreak of pertussis (whooping cough) forced the closure of Pines Academy in Pinesdale on Mon 8 Apr 2012, and prompted the Ravalli County Public Health Department to issue a warning.

"We have had 5 confirmed cases, which is definitely an outbreak," said Ravalli County public health nurse Judy Griffin. "And we are definitely expecting that number to go up in the next few days. It's a very serious disease. People die from it."

Griffin said all 5 of the people who tested positive live in the Pinesdale area northwest of Hamilton. Pines Academy is an elementary school there; school officials could not be reached for comment.

"The school voluntarily made the decision to close all week this week [week of 9 Apr 2012]," Griffin said. "People who might be sick need to get to the hospital, but otherwise stay at home and avoid contact if at all possible with other people and family members."

Griffin spent the day Mon 8 Apr 2012, on the phone with officials from all over Montana, some of whom are reporting similar outbreaks. "Kalispell [Flathead County] had a case, Lewis and Clark County had a case, and there has been reports from all over the state," she said. "Washington State has had over 600 cases so far in 2012, so they are at an epidemic stage."

It's back to school for many spring breakers, but even before vacation, schools like Silver Lake Elementary in Everett saw 10 percent of its student body out sick.

Snohomish County Health District officials can't say for sure what's behind the high number of absentees. They are tracking a health epidemic countywide: pertussis, also known as whooping cough.

"It's a tremendously serious disease for us and we're definitely in a middle of an epidemic," said Tim McDonald, Snohomish County Health District spokesman.

Whooping cough has hit Marysville the hardest in Snohomish County; 69 cases have been reported so far in 2012, as well as 32 in Arlington, and 25 cases in Everett.

"That's definitely the tip of the iceberg -- many more cases out there beyond the confirmed," said McDonald.

During this health epidemic, experts stress all teens and adults need to get the Tdap [tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis] vaccine to prevent spreading it to the more susceptible infants and young children.

The Bell County Public Health District said Mon 8 Apr 2012, it has received 7 more confirmed cases of pertussis, raising the total number of confirmed cases in the county to 21. The health department said it also has more than 20 other probable cases.

The health department first issued an advisory on 8 Mar 2012 after 4 Bell County residents were diagnosed with pertussis, also referred to as whooping cough. 3 of those cases were identified at Lakewood Elementary School in Belton, and Kennedy-Powell and Cater Elementary Schools in Temple, officials said. The 4th case was diagnosed in a 9-week-old Bell County infant.

The health department said Mon 8 Apr 2012, 3 of the most recent cases are linked to an unnamed school in Killeen.

A 7-week-old baby fought for her life after being diagnosed with pertussis. She is the most serious of 3 dozen cases diagnosed in 2012 in Boulder in what health officials are calling an outbreak.

Doctors at Children's Hospital diagnosed her with pertussis, also called whooping cough. For 9 days, she was hooked up to oxygen inside an incubator constantly being monitored at the hospital's Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.

"It was terrifying because we know that whooping cough can be fatal especially in such little babies. She was actually having such a hard time breathing, they had to help her breath and she stopped breathing a couple of times. So it was probably the worse thing I have ever went through," the mother said.

The infant is one of 37 cases of whooping cough in Boulder County in 2012. 30 of those cases are children who are under the age of 18. Health officials are calling it an outbreak.

There were some folks who were not vaccinated or were not up to date in their vaccinations," said Sophia Yager a nurse at Boulder County Public Health.

[Recommendations on the use of acellular pertussis vaccines in the USA continue to expand in efforts to cocoon susceptible neonates to prevent the substantial morbidity and mortality in infants who have not been yet adequately immunized like the one described in the Colorado posting. The use of the vaccine in pregnant women further expands these recommendations. It is likely given the limited number of contacts 5-week-old infants have that the reservoir of the infant was a family member.

The increasing susceptibility in older children and adults to pertussis usually manifesting as chronic cough without the typical "whoop" after appropriate primary immunization continues to be increasingly reported. Waning immunity is generally thought to be the cause of the problem, but it is increasingly clear that _Bordetella pertussis_ clones are being selected, against which we are no longer as well protected with the current vaccines. - Mod.LL]
