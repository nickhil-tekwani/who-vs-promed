INDIANAPOLIS -- Twenty-one people from central Indiana who have fallen ill
over a two-day period are suspected to have [infections caused by _E. coli
O157:H7_, but a common food source has yet to be identified]. Dr. Gregory
Steele, chief epidemiologist with the Indiana State Department of Health,
was quoted as saying, "Most definitely, we have an outbreak." The story
adds that six cases of strain, which is spread through [consumption of]
undercooked meat or unwashed vegetables, have been confirmed. The strain is
suspected in another 10 to 15 cases.
Dr. Crystal Jones, an infectious disease specialist with the Marion County
Health Department in Indianapolis, was quoted as saying, "The most
important thing we want to emphasize is if you're having any symptoms, to
get to a physician or to call the Health Department."
The state Department of Health posted a physician alert Thursday in
Indianapolis and nearby Johnson County. The alert warns area doctors and
hospitals to be observant for people showing symptoms, such as bloody
diarrhea.
The Centers for Disease Control (Atlanta) an estimates that 20,000
Americans are poisoned by this particular strain of _E. coli_ annually and
about 250 die.
