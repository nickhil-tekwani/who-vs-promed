Foot and mouth disease breaks out in Punjab
-------------------------------------------
Foot and mouth disease [FMD] has broken out among animal herds in parts of
Punjab, especially in Gujrat and nearby areas, posing a serious threat to
livestock, an official said on Tuesday [25 Jan 2005].
Dr. Hafiz Muhammad Mattiullah, the president of the Pakistan Livestock
Research Scientists Association (PLRSA), warned that the government needed
to take urgent action to prevent the disease from spreading further.
"If timely measures are not taken, a large number of precious animals will
fall prey to this deadly disease," he said at an emergency meeting of the
association, which was also attended by affected farmers.
The farmers said they had no idea how to stem the disease, because they had
gotten no help from the Livestock Department help line. They said the
disease was quickly spreading to other areas and that the authorities must
give farmers medicines.
Mattiullah offered the farmers free services to combat the disease. He also
appealed to the Punjab chief minister and minister for livestock to provide
the association with transport to affected areas where the PLRSA's
scientists could treat the ailing animals free of cost.

[The identity of the FMDV serotype(s) involved in the current outbreak, and
data on vaccinations, will be helpful.
FMD is endemic in Pakistan; the efficient way to help the farmers reduce
their losses is a preventive, not a curative one. Pakistan's last available
annual report to the OIE, for 2003, does not include data on vaccinations.
In 2002, 13 690 bovines and 28 765 buffalo were reportedly vaccinated; the
national herd included 22.8 million bovines and 24 million buffalo.
During 2004, 8 samples were sent from Pakistan to the OIE/FAO World
Reference Laboratory for Foot and Mouth Disease at Pirbright, UK. 2 of them
were found positive for FMDV (serotype Asia 1). During 2003, 81 samples
were sent, of which 29 were found positive for FMDV serotype O, 8 serotype
A and 4 serotype Asia 1. In 2 samples, mixed infections, including
serotypes O and A, were demonstrated. - Mod.AS].
