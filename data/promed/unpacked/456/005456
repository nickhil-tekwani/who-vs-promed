[1] Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (Lakki Marwat): 1st case with onset in 2020
Date: Sun 19 Jan 2020

The National Institute of Health (NIH) Islamabad has notified this year's [2020] 1st wild polio case in Tehsil Sarai Naurang of district Lakki Marwat. According to the notification, the poliovirus has been isolated from the stool sample of a 12-month-old male child from union council Bakhmal Ahmedzai, Sarai Naurang, Lakki Marwat. According to the family's vaccination history, they refused proper vaccination with only allowing their children one dose of essential immunisation and 3 doses of SIAs [supplemental immunization activities] as per recall.

It is pertinent to mention here that the oral polio vaccine (OPV) is the only cure [prevention rather than cure, and there are 2 vaccines, the oral polio vaccine and the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) - Mod.MPP] from poliomyelitis as once contracted the disease is incurable.

"The major cause of the surge in polio cases is parental refusal, misconceptions, and anti-polio propagandas," said Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) coordinator Abdul Basit.

"In the new year, we must pledge to wipe out this menace as the more it lingers on, the more children will be disabled for life and the country will continue to bear travel sanctions," he added.

He said that polio eradication was a government programme that protects children from disabilities, adding that eradicating the disease is a matter of national pride as it has already been wiped out across the globe except for Pakistan and Afghanistan.

[From the wording of the media report (and verified in a number of other media reports on the same event), the date of onset of paralysis for this child presumably was during 2020, representing continued circulation and transmission of the WPV1 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

[Until today [19 Jan 2019], the End Polio Pakistan website was showing a total of 12 cases of cVDPV2 occurring in the country. This total has increased by 6 additional cases to 18, with dates of onset in 2019. Cases have occurred in 4 different provinces/regions: Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan, and ICT. The presence of cases of cVDPV2 associated polio is an indicator of pockets of susceptibility in the area.

It would be interesting to learn the demographics of these cases including age, gender, vaccination history, and district where they reside. - Mod.MPP
