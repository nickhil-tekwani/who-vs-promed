According to the Greenbrier County Health Department, a skunk that
tangled with a dog on a tie-out in Alderson tested positive for the
disease.

The results came back from the West Virginia State Hygienic laboratory
on 26 Oct 2010.

The Monroe County Health Department announced a horse from Lindside
also tested positive for rabies, also on 26 Oct 2010.

The owners of the horse said it appeared to be healthy only a few
hours before it died.

Animal owners are urged to make sure their pets are up to date on
their rabies vaccinations.

[The article does not give us any information on the dog that was in
contact with the skunk. Without information, it is tempting to say
that perhaps the dog was vaccinated, but most states require even
vaccinated animals to receive a booster vaccine when having been in
contact with a rabid animal.

The article does not provide much information on the horse either.
Generally, there are some clinical signs. Otherwise, why does someone
test for rabies when this death could have been from colic or another
cause. - Mod.TG]

Orange County Animal Services received its 6th positive rabies test
result Wednesday [27 Oct 2010]. A skunk was tested after it was found
to have potential exposure with a dog at an Orange County residence
near High Rock Road and Maple Avenue in Efland.

On 26 Oct 2010, a resident woke early to her outdoor dog barking, and
saw the skunk run under her porch, when she brought her dog inside and
called the animal control.

Though the resident did not have direct contact with the skunk, she
did have direct contact with her dog, who was vaccinated against
rabies. A Communicable Disease Nurse from Orange County's Health
Department will contact the residents involved to evaluate their risk
of rabies exposure.

The number of rabies cases have increased to 9 in New Hanover County
this year [2010], with a positive test on a case involving a dog on
Holland Drive. The incident happened Monday [1 Nov 2010].

Animals with a current rabies vaccination when they're bit need to be
re-boostered within 5 days. The Centers for Disease Control also
recommends that unvaccinated pets be put down. Rabies can be
transmitted by a bite, salivary contact to an open wound, and salivary
contact to mucous membranes.

Animals with suspected cases of rabies should be handled with
protective gloves. The same goes for personal pets exposed to rabies.

A skunk in Efland tested positive for rabies last Wednesday [27 Oct
2010], Orange County Animals Services reported. The skunk was
submitted because of the potential exposure it had with a dog at a
residence in the vicinity of High Rock Road and Maple Avenue. The 2
residents at the home and another household dog all had contact with
the dog after the potential exposure.

The case occurred on Tuesday [26 Oct 2010], when a resident woke early
to her outdoor dog barking. When she went to investigate, a skunk ran
out from under the porch toward her.

She and the other household resident did not come in direct contact
with the skunk and brought the dog inside and away from the animal
while calling Animal Control. Though only one of the 2 dogs residing
at the home was in the vicinity of the skunk, the indoor dog did have
contact with the dog in question after it was brought inside the house.

Both dogs were currently vaccinated against rabies and were to receive
a booster shot in compliance with North Carolina law. According to
that law, if there is "a reasonable suspicion of exposure," a dog or
cat with a current vaccination must receive a booster shot within 120
hours. An unvaccinated animal must either be destroyed or quarantined
for a period of 6 months.

This is the 6th positive rabies result for Orange County in 2010.

A young boy, around 8 years old, is undergoing a series of rabies
shots after he found a dead bat at the Lindsay Lyons sports complex in
Atascocita on 19 Oct 2010, Humble Baseball Association (HBA) officials
say. The Harris County Precinct 4 Commissioner's Office confirmed the
bat tested positive for rabies.

HBA treasurer Sarah Wooley, who also serves as area director for
Nation's Baseball, HBA's national affiliate, said the boy has received
3 rabies shots.

Wooley said a group of kids were playing on an unoccupied baseball
field while games were in progress on other nearby fields when one of
the children found a dead bat that was apparently only recently
deceased just outside the fence-line.

The parents of the boy who was the primary handler of the bat were
close-by, Wooley said, watching an older brother play ball. The boy's
parents were informed, and Harris County Public Health and
Environmental Services officials were called. One of the boys' mother
requested the bat be tested for rabies.

According to county records, the parents of the affected child were
notified of the positive test results on 22 Oct 2010. The HBA has
since sent out notices to all parents, and county officials have
posted notices around the sports complex informing visitors of the
recent developments.

Two toddlers and a young woman were exposed to a possibly rabid bat in
the backyard of a family member's home in Atascocita South Saturday
afternoon, 30 Oct 2010.

According to the grandfather, his 2- and 3-year-old grandsons were
playing outside when the 20-year-old mother of one of the boys went to
investigate and discovered the children were playing with a live bat.
"The bat jumped up into my daughter's pants leg," the
father/grandfather said. "She shook it out, and it flew up into a palm
tree."

The children's grandfather, who works in the medical field and has a
nursing license, said his daughter and the 2 toddlers immediately went
to seek treatment at the emergency room at Memorial Hermann Northeast
Hospital.

"The doctor initially said they had nothing to worry about since he
couldn't find any bite marks," the father/grandfather said. "But I
insisted that all of them get started on the series of rabies shots."
[Given the fact that these were small children playing with a live bat
in the daylight, the likelihood of exposure seems like it would be
pretty high. Therefore, it is astonishing that the physician would not
suggest post exposure prophylaxis. Bat bite marks are often impossible
to detect, and the children may not have realized they were bitten or
gotten bat saliva in a small cut. - Mod.TG]

A call to the Harris County health department reinforced his decision
to insist on treatment. "They told me it was a good thing to get the
rabies shots," he said. "Anytime you see a bat on the ground,
especially in broad daylight, there's something wrong with it."

The father/grandfather said his daughter knew the 16-year-old Humble
teen who died from rabies in 2006 after he was bitten by a bat that
had found its way into his room while he was sleeping. The memory of
Jones, for whom treatment came too late, also prompted the insistence
on receiving the 5-part series of rabies shots, a painful procedure
administered in the buttocks.

This is the 2nd report of an encounter with a possibly rabid bat in
Atascocita in October 2010. Earlier this month [October 2010], a young
boy found a dead bat at the Lindsay Lyons sports complex. The bat
tested positive for rabies, and the boy is undergoing the rabies shot
series. So far, no symptoms of the disease are present in any of the
victims.

The Melrose Health Department and Melrose Canine Control Officer Diane
Kurkjian, CVT, are informing Melrose residents that a skunk caught on
Arlington Street in Melrose on Monday 11 Oct 2010 has tested positive
for rabies. A dog, which was in contact with the skunk, is being
quarantined; there were no other known contacts with the rabid animal.

The Health Department and Officer Kurkjian remind residents about what
to watch for in dealing with wildlife. People should not approach any
wildlife, or unknown domestic animals, they encounter outside.

If an animal appears sick, call Melrose Canine Control at
781-979-4102. Signs of illness would include discharge from the nose,
mouth or eyes; lack of coordination; walking into things; or otherwise
appearing to have neurological problems. Just being out in the
daytime, by itself, is not a sign of rabies. If a wild animal does not
appear sick, it can simply be ignored or scared away.

Pet owners should review their pets' rabies vaccination status. Pets
are much more likely than humans to have direct contact with wildlife,
and cats are more at risk than dogs, since many of them are free
roaming. This increases the risk to humans.

Owners of cats should consider keeping them indoors. Many cats each
year are lost to predators or are hit by cars. Cats will live longer,
healthier lives as indoor pets. However, even indoor-only pets should
be vaccinated against rabies, in case of accidental exposure.

A raccoon found near Warwick Terrace has tested positive for rabies,
Ledge Light Health District said Monday (1 Nov 2010).

The raccoon came into a resident's yard on Saturday [30 Oct 2010]. The
homeowner's 2 dogs were in the yard at the time, and one of the dogs
bit the raccoon, said George Calkins, senior sanitarian at Ledge
Light. One of the dogs was up-to-date on its rabies vaccine, but the
other had been overdue for a vaccine for a few days so must be
quarantined for 2 weeks, Calkins said. The raccoon was caught by the
town's animal control officer and taken to the state laboratory for
rabies testing.

Calkins said that although there was no human contact with the
raccoon, the owner is being checked by a physician as a precaution.
Signs warning about the rabid raccoon will be posted in the
neighborhood, located off Vauxhall Street Extension and Greentree Drive.

The public is reminded to refrain from feeding or approaching any wild
animals. For information, call the health district or the animal
control officer.

[9] Canine, equine, human exposure - Michigan

<http://www.wayneindependent.com/news/x1111394283/Rabies-cases-reported-in-Lake-Ariel>


2 cases of rabies involving a dog and a miniature horse have been
confirmed in Lake Ariel.

Marlene Metzger, Humane Society Police Officer for the Dessin Animal
Shelter, says both animals were located within a mile-and-a-half of
each other on Avoy Road. The dog, a collie-mix, died 26 Oct 2010,
while the miniature horse died in September 2010.

Both cases involved human exposure, requiring the pet owners to
undergo medical treatment. "At this point, we don't want to create any
hysteria, but we do want people who are in the area to watch their
pets. Make sure they're not unattended. We also want to make sure that
people have their pets vaccinated," said Dr. Amy Platko, a
veterinarian at Cherry Ridge Veterinary Clinic.

Platko says all cats and dogs 3 months of age or older should be
vaccinated and that pet owners should ensure that their pet's
vaccinations are up-to-date. The vaccine is "99 percent protective,"
Platko said. "If you do see any abnormal wounds on your pets, you
should contact your vet because they can re-inoculate them just to
give them added protection."

Platko says the collie was originally brought in for care because it
was limping and that it was "acting fine" at the time of the
evaluation. But within a week, it's condition had downgraded, with the
pet exhibiting abnormal, aggressive behavior before slipping into a
coma and dying. Rabid pets can appear in a stupor, exhibiting "less
responsive behaviors," Platko said, or they can become highly
aggressive.

Dr. Sandra Shaffer, Wallenpaupack Veterinary Clinic in Hawley, says
the miniature horse she was called to check on was storming its stall
door. "You'd open the stall door, and literally the horse would turn
around and charge at you ... which really struck me as an odd
behavior," Shaffer said. "It was also displaying abnormal neurologic
behavior. It was uncoordinated. It was making repetitive chewing
motions."

"When [people] think of rabies, they think of the classic rabid dog
that's snarling and drooling and maybe afraid of water. While large
animals can display those behaviors, rabies can look like anything in
large animals. ... This particular horse that we saw was screaming,"
Shaffer said. Shaffer said Pennsylvania has seen 4 case of rabies in
horses this year [2010] alone. [In actuality, the animals are not
afraid of water but unable to drink because of lack of muscular
control for swallowing. They cannot swallow their own saliva, and
hence the frequently observed drooling. The animals are often thirsty
but unable to drink. - Mod.TG]

"I think a lot of people are under the impression that rabies is a
small animal disease. We vaccinate dogs and cats routinely, but
oftentimes people are unaware that cows and horses and other livestock
are also susceptible," Shaffer said. Annual rabies vaccinations for
large animals run right around USD 25.

"I just think my main message is rabies is a disease that can affect
any mammal. And I think if you have large animals, it's just as
important to vaccinate them as it is your dog or cat," Shaffer said.

Dessin Animal Shelter Manager Sue Frisch says, "If you love your
animals, have them vaccinated. The animals that carry rabies are rural
as well as urban, so they're in town as well as out in the farmlands,
game lands and everywhere else."

[This article is good about pointing out that rabies can affect any

goat or a sheep, it is important to get it vaccinated against rabies.
That is for their protection and your protection. - Mod.TG]

[10] Bat, unknown human exposure - California
Date: 2 Nov 2010

A rabid bat was discovered near a middle school in San Juan
Capistrano, a city 20 miles south of Irvine. The bat, which was found
alive, was discovered on Wednesday, 20 Oct 2010. It is unknown whether
or not the bat transferred its infection to any other animals [or
humans], however no cases of rabies in humans or any mammal (other
than bats), have been reported in Orange County for many years.

Ryan Drabnk, the director of the Orange County Animal Care Center
explained the concern about rabies is still high. "Orange County is
still considered a rabies area," Drabnk said. "There have been 16
other cases of rabies, all concerning bats, in Orange County since the
beginning of this year [2010]."

Areas in Orange County where rabid bats have been found include
Newport Beach, Orange, Anaheim and Irvine. While rabid bats are not
uncommon in Orange County, this year [2010], there have been
particularly large numbers of infected animals discovered. The Orange
County Health Department and the Irvine Department of Animal Control
have both issued press releases warning O.C. residents to be aware of
the increased risk of rabies.

Rabies, a virus that can affect all mammals, is transferred through
saliva, making bites from rabid animals particularly dangerous. Dr.
David Lyon, a professor at UCI who uses the rabies virus in his
research, stated that an infected animal will, in the 1st 1-3 days
after infection, seem "depressed, moribund and hyper-excitable," and
"will exhibit marked depression in activity."

When left untreated, rabies is almost always fatal, so getting medical
attention before the symptoms set in is very important. If rabies is
confirmed, the "post-exposure treatment" includes an injection of
human antibodies for the rabies virus and a series of 4 intramuscular
shots given over weeks. "The treatment is equal to any other series of
shots, for instance, the measles vaccine," said Dr. Hildy Meyers,
medical director of epidemiology for the Orange County Health Care
Agency. She further warned that the best way to avoid contracting
rabies is to avoid contacting wild animals.

If you are bitten by an animal believed to be rabid, thoroughly wash
out the bite, making sure to clean out any saliva in the wound, and
then immediately seek medical attention.

[The continuing concern of pets lacking vaccination is prevalent in
this update. This update clearly points out the need to be vaccinating
your large animal pets. Vaccination for pets is effective and can save
owners from the loss of the pet in the event of exposure, but it is
also a safeguard for yourself if your pet is exposed.

If you believe you have been exposed, seek medical attention right
away. In the case of bats, even if you cannot find a bite wound, post
exposure prophylaxis may be in order. Once clinical signs are present
in humans, it is generally a fatal disease, so if you believe you have
been exposed, it is important to seek immediate medical care. - Mod.TG]
