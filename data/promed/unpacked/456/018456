[Since these were sporadic cases, not pneumonic & therefore not
transmissible person-to-person, contracted in rural areas, WHO would no
doubt say, "These cases have no significance for international travel."
But will this always remain so? And what about internal travel? At this
time of year thousands of vacationers flock to wilderness areas, taking
close-up shots of cute ground squirrels whose lack of fear of humans may
just be due to their being sick with plague. These avid photographers
could then take plague back to the big city (scenario of John Marr's
earlier novel, "The Plague.")
Which brings me to one of my favorite gripes. Countries are supposed to
report all *suspect* cases of cholera, plague & yellow fever within 24
hours to WHO, Geneva. Yet here is the USA detecting plague cases with
onset between 19 May and 14 June finally bestirring itself to notify WHO
more than 4 weeks later, between 17 & 24 July. Why should other countries
care about rapid notification when they have this example? - Mod.JW
