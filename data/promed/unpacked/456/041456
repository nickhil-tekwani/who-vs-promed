Within the framework of the epidemiological surveillance of the novel coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the Ministry of Health (MOH) has announced that 3 cases who had been previously announced to be infected with this virus have recovered. The 1st case is a 61-year-old citizen in Al-Ahsa governorate. The 2nd case is a 41-year-old Saudi female in Riyadh region. The 3rd case is a 50-year-old Saudi female in the Eastern region.

Furthermore, MOH has announced the death of a 75-year-old citizen in Al-Ahsa governorate, who is to be added to a 63-year-old Saudi female who passed away in Riyadh, among cases who had been previously announced to be infected with this virus. MOH has also pointed out that 569 samples have been tested at laboratories since the last statement, all of which have been proven negative except those that have been published.

[2] UK - one fatality

A man being treated in a London hospital for a lethal, SARS-like Middle Eastern virus has died. The man, a Qatari national, had been admitted to a private clinic in London in September [2012] before being transferred to the specialist centre at Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital.

He was diagnosed as suffering from the MERS virus -- Middle East Respiratory Syndrome -- which has affected 77 people worldwide, with 43 deaths.

"Guy's and St Thomas' can confirm that the patient with severe respiratory illness due to novel coronavirus [MERS-CoV] sadly died on Friday [28 Jun 2013], after his condition deteriorated, despite every effort and full supportive treatment," said Robin Wilkinson, a spokesman for the hospital.

The death of the Qatari man brings to 3 the number of victims who have died in the UK.

In February [2013], 2 members of the same family died from the virus. One, a 39-year-old man, died in Birmingham having picked up the virus from his father, who had recently travelled to Saudi Arabia. The father then died around a month later in Manchester's Wythenshaw hospital. A female relative was also treated for mild MERS symptoms, raising fears of human-to-human [transmission].

The disease is spread by people coughing or sneezing and can cause breathing difficulties, lung damage and pneumonia.

"We still don't know exactly what killed him," said Dr Jon Bible, a virus expert at Guy's and St Thomas'. "In the end, his lungs were worn down, so secondary infection is the real problem. The virus effectively turns your lungs to jelly."

Known cases of the illness have quadrupled since April 2013, and it is deadlier than SARS, which killed 774 people in 2003. SARS killed one in 10 affected people; MERS has proved fatal in 65 per cent of cases.

The majority of the cases have been in Saudi Arabia, or in patients who have recently travelled to the region. But with the annual Hajj pilgrimage due in October [2013], and an estimated 3 million people travelling to Mecca, concerns are mounting that the deadly virus could spread swiftly.

"We need to get the facts clear and get the appropriate advice to all your countries where your pilgrims want to go to Mecca," said Margaret Chan, head of the World Health Organisation, in May [2013]. "It is something quite urgent."

Still unknown to scientists is how the [MERS] virus emerged, how people are being exposed to it, and whether the contagion is growing. So far, the leading theory is that MERS likely originated in bats and spread to humans.

Cases have been reported in Jordan, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Britain, France, Italy, Tunisia and Saudi Arabia, the country with the most confirmed infections [see prior ProMED-mail posts listed below for more details - Mod.MPP].

Belgian medics have warned Muslims not to travel to Mecca, because the Hajj threatens to spread the virus worldwide. Doctors expressed concerns that the mass gatherings are "ideal hotbeds for respiratory diseases" and that numbers of MERS cases are greater than actually reported in Saudi Arabia. Doctors in Saudi Arabia say they are monitoring the disease closely.

"This is really a new phenomenon that we're dealing with," said Keiji Fukuda, WHO assistant director general for health security, at a Geneva conference on infection last month [June 2013].

"We don't know what the potential is yet, based on the information we have, for sustained human-to-human transmission. We don't know what the full geographic extent of this virus is right now."

The unnamed man in London had been treated in a "negative pressure room," an isolation chamber within the hospital, which means that contaminated air is not pumped back out into the hospital. All doctors treating the patient would have been equipped with protective suits, which were incinerated after use.

He had initially shown signs of improvement, but his condition deteriorated, and he passed away last week. It is unclear how he contracted the disease, although there are known cases in Qatar.

A conference is due to be held in London on Tuesday [9 Jul 2013] to discuss how to handle preventing spreading the disease.

"This case shows that we are dealing with an extremely dangerous virus," said Gregory Hartl, spokesman for WHO. "This disease is slower-burning than SARS, but we don't yet know what to do about it."

[With the inclusion of these 3 newly reported deaths attributable to MERS-CoV infection, the global total of laboratory confirmed infections remains 77, but the number of deaths has increased to 43. The above Saudi MOH report highlights the number of specimens tested for MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia (since the last official statement on 23 Jun 2013; see MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (34): Saudi Arabia, WHO 20130624.1788112).

The fatality in the UK was the 2nd reported case of MERS-CoV identified in September 2012 several days following the report of the MERS-CoV isolate from a severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) death in Saudi Arabia. (see prior ProMED-mail posts Novel coronavirus - Saudi Arabia (03): UK HPA, WHO, Qatar 20120923.1305982 and Novel coronavirus - Saudi Arabia: human isolate 20120920.1302733 for more details).
