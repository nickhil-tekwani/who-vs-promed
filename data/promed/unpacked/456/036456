[According to WRLFMD's webpage above, 7 samples were received from Lebanon
on 24 Mar 2009. Four of them have been serotyped as FMDV-A and genotyped,
but the report of the genotype is awaiting approval from the Lebanese
authorities. It would be surprising if the genotype involved is not similar
to the FMDV-A Iran 05 strain currently spreading in several countries in
the region, such as Iraq, Libya, Bahrain, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia. A
recent report of the FAO/OIE/EC FMD reference Laboratory, Institute for
Animal Health, Pirbright, UK "Situation of FMD in the Middle-East", is
available at
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_epidemiology/Note%20recent%20FMD%20events%20in%20M-East.pdf>.


Lebanon submitted an "immediate notification" to the OIE (World
Organisation for Animal Health) on 20 Feb 2009, concerning FMD outbreaks in
cattle, recorded in 11 villages. The outbreak had, reportedly, started a
month earlier, namely on 19 Jan 2009. The identity of the virus was, at the
time of notification, "pending" and the following comment was included:
"Samples taken from clinical cases shall be sent soon to the OIE Reference
Laboratory of Pirbright [WRLFMD] for serotyping and matching test." The
current information, now becoming available following a rather torpid
submission, has not yet been officially reported by Lebanon to the OIE.

FMDV-A Iran 05, against which previously used serotype A FMD vaccines may
have provided immunity only partly, is probably present also in other
countries in the region. So far, it has not been identified in Lebanon's
southern neighbour, Israel, where FMDV-O has been identified since January
2009, thus far causing 10 outbreaks in unvaccinated animals. It will be
interesting to obtain updated information from Lebanon's other neighbour,
Syria, a country with more than a million heads of cattle and 24 million
sheep and goats, where no FMD outbreaks have been reported since 2002. -
