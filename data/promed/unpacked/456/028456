As the world celebrated the 15th International Malaria Day [25 April], it is clear that it remains a major health problem in Burundi. Without updated figures, actors in the fight believe that the fight must continue.

In internal medicine at the Kamenge Health District Hospital, our source indicates that there were 12 people hospitalized, including 8 suffering from malaria. Among the sick, serious cases are reported. "There are those who have reached the stage of anemia."

A woman caring for her 6-year-old child at the district hospital, says she brought the child in a critical situation 4 days ago. "Fortunately, he is gradually recovering," rejoices this mother of 7 children. She acknowledges that she and her children do not cover themselves with insecticide-treated mosquito nets. A man whose 10-month-old child is sick with malaria says he and his family have mosquito nets even though his child is sick. "Mosquito nets do not provide 100% protection."

Actions carried out for the fight
---------------------------------
At this district hospital, there are also the offices of the head of the northern district of Bujumbura. BÃ©nigne Ndikumana, supervisor in hospitals and dispensaries in the district recognizes that malaria is the main cause of death in her district.

But, she reassures, actions are being taken to fight against this disease. "The health district gives mosquito nets to pregnant women who are doing the prenatal consultation for the 1st time so that they protect themselves with their children, they also receive a tablet that protects the fetus, so that their babies are not born with this disease," announces Benigne Ndikumana.

Children who are vaccinated against measles also benefit from insecticide-treated mosquito nets. "They are distributed free of charge and it is always available for these targeted beneficiaries".

This is not like the actions carried out in the northern health district of Bujumbura. The district supervisor points out that the community workers raise awareness about the fight against malaria. According to her, the district is doing everything to fight against malaria: prevention, treatment, diagnosis, etc.

Albert Mbonerane, president of the association "Action de Lutte contre la Malaria" (ALUMA), taking up OCHA's situation report for 2021, points out that Burundi is not yet at the point of eradicating malaria.

In December 2021, continues Albert Mbonerane, nearly 5.7 million cases of malaria were recorded in Burundi. For him, things don't change much.

He believes that the fight continues and that it is necessary to put together the energies to eradicate this disease which is the 1st cause of mortality in Burundi. According to him, malaria is linked to climate change. "The more the temperature rises, the greater the proliferation of mosquitoes."

According to him, the torrential rains which are also observed promote stagnant water which in turn causes the multiplication of mosquitoes. "If we don't protect the environment, and the temperature continues to rise, death cases are likely to increase."

Mr Mbonerane regrets that some patients still resort to the sorcerer. To mitigate the risks of malaria, the president of the ALUMA association proposes sensitization on all the hills to tell the population that malaria is cured when it is treated in time at the hospital.

The vaccine is not coming soon
------------------------------
For the gradual decline in deaths observed in 2021 to continue, CEMABU [Burundian association fighting for patients' rights] proposes strategies such as the intensification of the strategic front initiated by the government, namely the mosquito net distribution campaign (CDM), indoor spraying (PID), organization, at least once a quarter, of awareness caravans on the fight against malaria, etc.

The Ministry of Public Health has yet to release updated figures for malaria cases. In a press release dated 24 Mar 2022, Minister Sylvie Nzeyimana acknowledges that malaria remains a public health problem. "We must continue to do everything to ensure that the entire population is protected against malaria."

She regrets that although the World Health Organization has announced the existence of vaccines against malaria, they cannot reach all countries including Burundi. "They are still not enough."

Nevertheless, it reveals that many actions have been taken to fight against this disease. These include the adoption of new anti-malarial drugs, making every effort to ensure that drugs and equipment are not lacking, as well as the training of community health workers to treat children under 5 in their communities.

International Malaria Day will be celebrated on Fri 6 May 2022 in Muyinga.

[The annual number of malaria cases was estimated to be approximately 3.5 million out of a total population of about 11 million in 2020 (WHO World Malaria Report 2021, Annex 5F). This is an increase from an estimated 1.4 million cases (population 8.9 million) in 2011.

The sale and distribution of insecticide treated nets, ITNs, in Burundi was 7 528 556 in 2019 but decreased to 682 757 in 2020. In 2019 the number of artemisinin combination treatments, ACT, was 9 271 032 but fell to 4 708 998 in 2020. The proportion of households where at least one person slept under an ITN was estimated at 34.7% (all cited data are from the WHO World Malaria Report 2021 https://www.who.int/teams/global-malaria-programme/reports/world-malaria-report-2021).

Therefore, the lack of progress is probably related to low coverage of ITNs and decreasing number of treatments administered and not to climate change. Burundi is listed as one of the countries to receive the RTS,S malaria vaccine. - Mod.EP
