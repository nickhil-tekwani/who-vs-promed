[This FMD event, which started in January 2017 and decreased during the summer months, has flared up recently, affecting all provinces in the eastern half of Mongolia as well as neighbouring territories in Russia and China; the involvement of wildlife has been suspected (see 20180301.5657440).

According to a recent media report, Mongolia has planned to start a vaccination campaign in May 2018, applying Russian vaccines. "Mongolian quarantine officials are using lemonic acid to disinfect all vehicles that come from the infected areas to the capital city." Currently, "a martial law has been declared in 23 soums (administrative subdivisions) in 8 provinces to control the spread of FMD." (see http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-03/26/c_137066576.htm; thanks to the submitter, ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall).

Links to the 8 reports submitted to the OIE since the start of this event on 24 Jan 2017, as well as an interactive map presenting the 66 accumulated outbreaks as of 29 Mar 2018, are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=22811.

As reported in 20170901.5288720, the WRLFMD at Pirbright had sequenced a field isolate received from Mongolia (O/MOG/10/2017), genotyped as 'O/ME-SA/PanAsia'. The Mongolian virus was subjected to vaccine matching strain differentiation (VMSD) test, with the following results: "good matching results with O/TUR/5/2009 but not with O-3039 and Manisa." The above and additional genotyping results from Mongolia are available at the WRLFMD website.

The most recent analysis (8 Feb 2018), indicates that on top of the above mentioned FMDV strain (topotype ME-SA, lineage PanAsia), another lineage of the ME-SA topotype (Middle East-South Asia) is currently circulating in Mongolia, namely Ind-2001d. (Dundgovi, cattle, virus sample name: MOG/14/2017. Date of collection: 18 Nov 2017).
