Russia reports suspected case of anthrax
---------------------------------------------
2 Russian butchers in the southern Siberian region of Altai were suspected
of having contracted anthrax on Monday [15 Aug 2005] after slaughtering an
infected cow, local media reported. Itar-Tass news agency reported that the
men had already sold contaminated meat to a client, possibly from the
neighboring region of Kemerovo, raising fears the disease could spread.
"Their preliminary diagnosis is anthrax," Ria-Novosti news agency quoted a
regional health official as saying.
Altai, a steppe region near Russia's border with China, Mongolia and
Kazakhstan, is one of the country's suppliers of meat products and grain.
The news came at a time when Russia is trying to contain an outbreak of
deadly bird flu that is being spread by birds migrating towards European
Russia from Siberia.

[A case of the same-old, same-old, while there is a certain
hypersensitivity in government quarters to cases of anthrax, the reality is
that humans are moderately resistant and that natural cutaneous cases are
most likely to occur when individuals are slaughtering and butchering or
necropsying an infected carcass, when infected blood gets into cuts and
abrasions, usually on the hands and forearms, face infections only
occurring when scratched with a bloody finger. Modest precautions, like
wearing gloves and afterwards washing up with soap and water, are
frequently adequate, as is common sense not to necropsy a possible anthrax
case without 1st checking by making a stained blood smear to check for
capsulated organisms. Frankly, humans are poor canaries for this disease,
which is why effective control programs target unexpected and sudden deaths
in livestock and regard human cases as backups if the former are missed.
Kyriakus Polydoru, one of my veterinary heroes and a most effective Chief
Veterinary Officer for Cyprus, eradicated anthrax from Cyprus in a
relatively short campaign. One of his tools was to make it a legal duty of
the owner to report any livestock death to the village policeman, with a
mandatory 21-day incarceration for non-reporters... and there was a reward
if a neighbor turned you in when you hadn't reported it first. This made
surveillance effective. There were carrots, like free vaccines and help
with disposal, but also a sturdy stick. Sticks without carrots are
counterproductive, which is one of the Russian problems with this disease.
