Spanish authorities are about to begin slaughtering hundreds of calves that have spent months crisscrossing the Mediterranean, said a lawyer for the cattle shippers.

The 864 cattle due for slaughter are onboard the Karim Allah, which is docked in the Spanish port of Cartagena. It is one of 2 vessels that left Spain in mid-December 2020 to deliver live cargoes of young bulls. The 2nd vessel, Elbeik, loaded almost 1800 cattle from Tarragona.

The Elbeik, now carrying more than 1700 cattle, also appears to be returning to Spain.

Both shipments ran into problems when they were refused entry by various countries, including Turkey and Libya, owing to fears the animals had a disease called bluetongue, which causes lameness and hemorrhaging among cattle but does not affect humans.

Disease regulations outlined by Spanish officials mean the cattle cannot re-enter the EU having attempted to enter Libya. The slaughter order issued to Karim Allah's management, seen by the Guardian, states that Libya: "Has a ban on the export of animals to the EU due to the existence of, among other epizootic diseases of major impact for livestock, foot-and-mouth disease in that state" [see comment].

"The Spanish authorities have indicated they will start killing the cattle on Tue [2 Mar 2021]," said Miquel Masramon, a lawyer representing Talia Shipping Line. The Karim Allah is owned by Khalifeh Livestock Trading and managed by Talia Shipping Line, both based in Lebanon, while the cattle are owned by a 3rd party.

In a statement on Saturday [27 Feb 2021], the agriculture ministry indicated that if the Karim Allah did not begin to "isolate and slaughter the animals in accordance with the applicable regulations" the ministry would do so.

A source at the ministry said on Sun [28 Feb 2021] the shipper had been informed that it had until Mon 1 Mar 2021 midday to begin the slaughter. The ministry said: "It is up to the shipowner in the 1st instance to isolate and slaughter the animals. He has until 1st thing tomorrow morning [Mon 1 Mar 2021] to communicate his decision to the administration."

Both the director of Talia Shipping Line, Majed Eid, and Masramon said they would fight the decision. Their aim, they say, is to allow the cattle time to heal and then find a new buyer, once they have the results of bluetongue blood tests taken last week.

A report by Spanish veterinary officials who boarded the Karim Allah last week said the captain told them of 22 deaths at sea. Another 9 cattle were not accounted for. The report said 20 of the animals that died were chopped up and thrown overboard during the journey, citing information provided by the captain.

The report concluded that the animals had suffered from the lengthy journey and were generally in a poor state. Some were unwell and not fit for transport outside the EU, or fit to be allowed into Europe. Euthanasia would be best for their health and welfare, it concluded.

The report did not say whether the cattle had bluetongue but noted other skin, eye and leg conditions including alopecia, flaking, scabs, and joint inflammation compatible with septic arthritis.

On Sunday [28 Feb 2021], Masramon said he was trying to get a new veterinary report and was hoping to get a vet to board the ship and "inspect the animals and respond to the Spanish authorities' veterinary report. The problem right now is to get the [vet] official approval to enter the port."

[Following the refusal to unload its cargo in Turkey, the Karim Allah visited Tripoli (Libya) in an attempt to sell the Spanish cattle there, but was similarly refused. Spain's refusal to allow the unloading of the returning cattle is attributed by the authorities to the passage of the vessel in Tripoli, since Libya is regarded FMD-infected. Vaccination against FMD has been prohibited in the EU since 1991, accompanied by a severe import policy to protect the fully FMD-susceptible European cattle. Import is banned from FMD-infected, suspected, or vaccinating countries/regions. Libya was also suspected, in early 2020, of Rift Valley fever infections in small ruminants (by serology).

According to other reports (The Guardian, Reuters), a 2nd vessel with a consignment of cattle from Spain is returning to Spain; this refers to the Elbeik, which set sail a day after Karim Allah from Tarragona with a cargo of nearly 1800 cattle similarly destined to Turkey. Both vessels were refused unloading in Turkey. On Sat 27 Feb 2021, tracking the website Marine Traffic showed the Elbeik on its way back to Spain, destined for Cartagena. The vessel's return to Spain was confirmed in an email from the Cypriot government's chief veterinary officer, Christodoulos Charalambous Pipis, who has been monitoring the Elbeik. It spent several days anchored off the coast of northern Cyprus, outside the port of Famagusta.

Late last week, a source told the Guardian that of the 1770 or so animals loaded on the Albeik, about 35 might have died, and the rest were in good condition. "They are limousin and charolais cross [bulls], between 6 and 12 months old," the source said.

Representatives from the Karim Allah and Elbeik argued that they were "100% sure" the cattle on the ship were bluetongue-free and that "there was a mistake on the Spanish animal health paperwork. That is how this all started. They wrote Aragon [as the cattle's origin]. Aragon is not free of bluetongue the last 24 months." According to them, the animals were not from Aragon, but from Zaragoza and Teruel, which are "150 km away from the focus [of the bluetongue areas]," and met the requirement of having come from a bluetongue-free area.

The Spanish agriculture ministry previously told the Guardian that the ships' situation had "nothing to do with the actions of the Spanish administration" and that the cattle had come from areas free of bluetongue.

On 24 Nov 2020, Spain reported to the OIE 4 outbreaks of BTV-8 affecting cattle, located in Pais Vasco/Basque Country (2), Aragon (1) and Navarra (1).

The whole event may be reminiscent of the 2012 Ocean Drover event, when a sheep consignment from Australia to the Gulf states was rejected due to animal health reservations, eventually ending up in Pakistan after being anchored off a Bahrain port for at least a fortnight. Return to Australia was rejected by the Australian authorities. Testing on arrival in Pakistan cleared the sheep of ill-health concerns (see 20121004.1325036, 20120917.1297467). - Mod.AS
