_Ralstonia solanacearum_ detected again
---------------------------------------
The NPPO [National Plant Protection Organization] of Poland recently informed EPPO of another detection of _Ralstonia solanacearum_ (EPPO A2 List) on potatoes on its territory (see also EPPO RS 2015/001) [ProMED-mail post 20150210.3157933].

The bacterium was detected in 2016 in a lot of ware potatoes (_Solanum tuberosum_ cv. 'Lady Claire') which had been grown on an area covering approximately 250 ha [about 618 acres] and located in Central Western Poland. The infested area was estimated at approximately 22 ha [about 54 acres].

Phytosanitary measures will be taken to eradicate the disease.

[Brown rot (also called bacterial wilt) of potato is caused by _Ralstonia solanacearum_ race 3 (biovar 2, adapted to cooler temperatures) or race 1 (prevalent in warmer areas). Yield losses are mostly caused by tuber rotting. In many warmer areas of the world, brown rot is one of the main limiting factors in potato production. The pathogens can also affect tomato and other solanaceous plants. Different races and biovars cause lethal wilting diseases on more than 200 known hosts including many important crops.

Brown rot symptoms on potato include internal staining and rotting of tubers, as well as wilting and death of plants. The disease may result in substantial yield losses. However, there may also be latent infections. The pathogens can survive in potato tubers during storage posing a high risk for introduction of the pathogen to new areas.

The bacteria are spread by mechanical means (including insects), contaminated equipment, infected plant material (including seed potatoes), soil and water. They can survive in soil on plant debris or roots of hosts. Some weeds and unharvested potato plants may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Disease management is difficult, relying mostly on exclusion from new areas. Some cultural methods (such as crop rotation) and limited genetic resistance may be used.

In Poland, brown rot was reported for the first time in 2015 in the south west (ProMED-mail post 20150210.3157933) in ware potatoes from certified seed tubers of the same cultivar 'Lady Claire'. It is not clear whether the new outbreak reported above may be connected with that initial detection. Furthermore, item 018 in the same source document also reports the detection of _R. solanacearum_ in ornamental rose plants in southern Poland, but a possible connection of the outbreaks in the different hosts is not discussed.
