Dengue deaths in Puerto [Rico] so far in 2010 increased to 2 after
confirmation of a new death, the Subsecretary of Health, Concepcion
Quinones de Longo, announced today [6 Apr 2010]. This official stated
also that according to data from the Center for Disease [Prevention
and] Control (CDC), in the week of 5-11 Mar [2010], 189 cases of this
disease were confirmed on this Caribbean island.

Quinones de Longo recalled that the reported cases exceeded the
threshold for declaration of an epidemic and that the municipalities
most affected are Naguabo, Humacao, Las Piedras, Yabucoa, Juncos,
Arecibo, Hatillo and Santa Isabel.

She requested the collaboration of the citizens, businesses and
schools to overcome this disease classified as endemic on this
Caribbean island. The Puerto Rican health authorities this past March
[2010] declared a dengue epidemic on this Caribbean island after the
threshold number for the established number of registered cases of
this disease for 2 consecutive weeks was exceeded.

The combination of high temperatures and rain during the past month
of January [2010] favored massive reproduction of the _Aedes aegypti_
mosquito, especially on the northern coasts and east of the country.

At least 14 people have died of dengue fever this year [2010] in the
Dominican Republic, the health authorities said Wednesday [7 Apr
2010]. Health Minister Nelson Rodriguez said 2000 cases of dengue
fever have been registered, 291 of which were the hemorrhagic kind.
He said the country could have more dengue cases this year than last
year's [2009] 8800. A total of 52 died of the disease last year.

Rodriguez attributed the increase of the cases to the drought
affecting the country, which causes the appearance of the _Aedes
aegypti_ mosquito that harbors the virus.

Given the situation, the Health Ministry has expanded the prevention
plan and raised the epidemic alert.

[The Minister of Health did not explain why the drought contributed
to the increase of _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes, but it is likely due
to residents storing water in and around their houses, providing more
breeding sites for this vector mosquito.

The [number] of dengue cases in Tachira have increased. Authorities
of Environmental Health, the Mayor's office and Sanitary District III
agreed to work as a team to face the dengue threat that continues to
affect the population of Boliva municipality, where an average of 5
weekly cases are registered. Of these weekly reported cases, 4 are
[classical] dengue fever and one is DHF [This is a high ratio of DHF
cases compared to classical dengue cases. - Mod.TY]. In general,
children are the most affected by DHF.

There was a meeting and agreement to form a team to address this
problem and carry out an _Aedes_ survey in order to know about how
water catchments are handled in the affected areas. Also, an abate
[mosquito larvicide] application will be done to kill larvae, and
later they will carry out fumigation, said the epidemiologist.

An urgent meeting is expected in which Colombian and Venezuelan
health authorities will participate to halt this disease along the
border [of the 2 countries].

Dengue is now epidemic. Although it is certain that dengue cases at a
regional level are less in comparison with those of last year [2009],
the Piura Regional Health Director, Dr. Cesar Moron, has considered
that Piura and Castilla are now living through an epidemic. The
[numbers] of infected individuals are increasingly more, and the
[number] of fatal victims now total 2.

These statements were given yesterday [3 Apr 2010] after
participation in a meeting of the Committee for Emergencies of the
regional government. There was agreement to sign a resolution to
declare a "red alert" in the region in order to increase
responsibility and response in facing dengue. As a result, during 90
days, [health] units and hospitals will be on alert to attend any
emergency, said the Director of Health. The regional council will be
requested to waive [usual] buying processes for purchase of materials
such as abate [larvicide] and insecticide. Between 8-30 Apr 2010,
health professionals will be involved with 120 000 properties to
carry out control actions and identification of larvae and positive
[human dengue] cases.

Dengue [virus] serotype 2 is circulating in Asuncion, which implies a
high risk of serious cases in the neighborhoods, according to the
Ministry of Public Health (MSP). The office of the Director General
of Health Surveillance identified a dengue [virus] 2 outbreak in the
Bernardino Caballero neighborhood of the capital. An active search
for febrile cases in the area, after finding the 1st affected
individual, led to the discovery of 9 dengue cases in this central
neighborhood. Dengue [viruses] type 1 and 3 have circulated
previously.

"This is a special alert call for Asuncion residents and for the
community of the capital, since dengue [virus] 2 could produce a
large-scale epidemic in Asuncion, if there are sufficient mosquitoes
to have transmission spread," said Dr. Ivan Allende, Director General
of Health Surveillance. He stressed that this possibility is real
when the infestation indices are around 5 percent, as in this case
[If this is a Breteau index, 5 percent is high according to WHO
standards and implies a significant risk of transmission. - Mod.TY].
Allende explained that during Holy Week [Easter week], efforts were
carried out to block virus transmission in the Bernardino Caballero
neighborhood.

To date, the Epidemiological Surveillance System has registered
notification of 5000 suspected dengue cases, of which 1828 have been
confirmed. "This gives us an incidence of 29 percent per 100 000
population, which signifies a low magnitude epidemic, considering the
numbers," noted Allende. None the less, he pointed out that
simultaneous circulation of the 3 [dengue virus] serotypes could
change this into a high-risk epidemic.

Since the beginning of the epidemic (in October 2009), 1828 dengue
cases have been confirmed. To date, 129 people have been
hospitalized. There are 5 deaths from dengue.

the interior of homes provides an environment propitious for the

This past Monday [5 Apr 2010], the Secretariat of Health of Ribeirao
Preto announced that the number of confirmed dengue cases in the city
reached 8495, an increase of 41.7 percent in relation to the total
[cases] registered in 2006, the year of the worst [dengue] epidemic
in the city. To get an idea, this increase exceeds the total number
of cases reported in 2009, 1694.

According to the Information System for Notifiable Diseases (SINAN)
of the state Secretariat of Health, Ribeirao Preto leads the state's
ranking for dengue in the 1st half of this year [2010]. In total,
there are 6928 victims of the [dengue virus transmtted by] the _Aedes
aegypti_ mosquito.

The Breteau index, which measures the infestation of _Aedes aegypti_,
also is high in the municipality. According to the World Health
Organization, the ideal is to have an index less than one percent,
whereas Ribeirao registers 2.8 percent.

The city government continues to request that the population help
with work to combat the disease, now that the Division of Vector
Control stated that 80 percent of the [mosquito] breeding sites are
within houses. Since the weather forecast for the next few days is
for rain and heat, a climate propitious for proliferation of the
mosquito, attention must be even greater. It is worth remembering
that this is the worst epidemic of the disease that Ribeirao Preto
has lived through.

A check of the number of cases in the city by region are: eastern
3419, south 2614, north 927, central 878 and east 657.

There are now 3246 confirmed [dengue] cases in Carangola. The city
government says that it is taking the necessary steps [to deal with
the outbreak]. The Public [Justice] Ministry is charging the
Carangola city government for [failure to take] action to combat
dengue. Prosecutors said nearly 10 percent of the population already
had the disease. The case is in court.

In the municipality, there now have been 3246 confirmed cases.
"Despite efforts for public awareness, the population leaves many
foci [of mosquito breeding] and this favors proliferation of the
mosquito," said the Interim Secretary of Health, Anderson Barbosa.

In 2 months, Brazil has registered more than 220 000 dengue cases.
Rio Grande do Sul has registered more than 3400 dengue cases. Because
of the large number of cases, the Public [Justice] Ministry
Prosecutor filed a lawsuit and questions the actions of the
Municipality of Carambola. The Secretariat of Health is accused of
not meeting the standards of the National Program for Combat of
Dengue. "This program was not completed and was not observed, and
this led to the epidemic situation, " said prosecutor Mark Aguiar
Arle.

The Carangola Prefecture denied this accusation and stated that since
November of last year [2009], a vehicle that distributed poison
against the mosquito [abate larvicide?] went around the streets of
the city. Also, according to the municipal administration, 59 agents
work in combating dengue fever, and a task force of 15 men sent by
the State Health Department arrived on Monday [5 Apr 2010] to the
city to reinforce these actions.

[It is unfortunate that the situation has led to legal action. This
report does not indicate if prospective vector surveillance was being
carried out to determine if household vector mosquito infestation
indices were being reduced. Simply distributing insecticides without
an aggressive public education program coupled with technical
surveillance is not likely to be effective at reducing dengue virus
transmission. - Mod.TY]

There has been an increase of 1500 percent in dengue cases in the
Bahia interior. The dengue epidemic is provoking alarm in the Bahia
[state] municipality of Jaguarari, at 400 km [249 miles] from
Salvador. With just 13 000 inhabitants, the municipality has
registered 229 suspected dengue cases, with 20 laboratory confirmed,
since the beginning of the year [2010]. In the 1st 3 months of last
year [2009], there were 16 reported cases with 7 confirmed.

The increase in the number of suspected dengue cases and infestations
of the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito led to coordination of municipal
epidemiology to intensify combat of foci of mosquito breeding sites.
Meetings and pamphlet distributions were carried out with help from
schools, shopkeepers and society. "We intensified action; the
collaboration began at the beginning of February [2010] and was
completed in March 2010. We went along the streets carrying out
house-to-house work to make people aware of how to proceed in the
house to avoid foci for the disease," said Ana Patricia Lima de
Oliveira, nurse of the Familia de Pilar Health Post. According to
her, one of the main causes in the increase of [mosquito] infections
is the accumulation of trash in open areas, vacant lots and storm
drains.

In the entire state there have been 5 deaths.

<http://news.brunei.fm/2010/04/05/dengue-under-control-says-moh/>


The Ministry of Health yesterday [4 Apr 2010] assured the public that
dengue was under control and was not showing any serious outbreak
patterns despite a recent sharp rise in cases in the 1st 3 months of
the year [2010]. Since January this year [2010], the ministry has
recorded a total of 53 positive cases. Only 38 cases were recorded
last year [2009].

There were more dengue cases this year [2010] due to patterns of
mosquito breeding through global warming and alternating seasons in
the country, said Dr Rahmah Hj Md Said, Director-General at the
Health Services Department. "However, we are not overtly concerned,
as we manage to keep things currently under control and intensify our
vector control activities," she told The Brunei Times.

Dr Hjh Rahmah said the ministry was hard at work and in the process
of identifying the type of dengue strain [serotype] circulating in
the country. She added that if health officials identify more than
one strain [serotype], then that would be a "more worrying factor."

She said that the ministry would continue to inform the public on the
current situation and that they have a big role in preventing the
spread of the disease.

She said that dengue cases had been minimal in Brunei in the late
1990s. It was only in 2002 that the country experienced a dengue
outbreak, and the disease has since remained endemic in the country.
"It was not really a huge outbreak when it 1st occurred 8 years ago,
but it called on us to be more vigilant and act immediately to
control the situation and make sure it doesn't get out of hand. It
marked the start of a more structured vector control activity," she
said. "Furthermore, people are more educated and aware of the
symptoms of dengue today; they now go for a medical check-up as soon
as they experience fever," she added.

Dr Hjh Rahmah said that despite the noticeably sharp rise in the
number of cases this year [2010], the dengue cases in Brunei do not
show any outbreak patterns yet. "We are looking at an increased
number of cases affecting several different areas. However, we do not
have outbreaks right now, but we are currently doing our best to
prevent any from occurring," she said.

As of 31 Mar this year [2010], the ministry has recorded 53 positive
cases. Most cases were detected among residents in the Brunei-Muara
district, particularly villages in Kampong Ayer. "Based on our vector
control activities, we have identified that Kampong Ayer is currently
a highly active breeding site of the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, the
primary mosquito for the spread of dengue [viruses], " said the
director-general. "This is why we stress that people specifically
living in Kampong Ayer make a big effort in terms of cleaning their
surroundings at all times and taking measures in eliminating mosquito
breeding in their surroundings," she added. She went on to say that
spraying is just a temporary method to get rid of mosquitoes but that
the best primary intervention was to eliminate the potential breeding
grounds.

Kampong Ayer residents have been advised to dispose of all rubbish
properly and close the lids of all rubbish bins and keep free of
stagnant water in and around the house. Keep an eye on flower pots
with water, empty drums, bottles and canisters, as well as ensure
unused perahu (small boats) are turned over. They have been also
advised to cooperate with the ministry to tackle the rise in dengue
cases.

The yearly dengue fever outbreak claimed the lives of 2 children at
Sanglah Hospital last week. The 2 victims were a 4-year-old from
Badung regency who died Thursday [1 Apr 2010], and an 11-year-old
from Karangasem regency who died Friday [2 Apr 2010]. Both patients
had only been treated for a day.

At least 6 people -- 4 of them children -- have died of the disease
at the hospital this year [2010]," Ken Wirasandhi, head of the
hospital's service department, said. "Both victims suffered from
dengue shock syndrome."

Dengue patients experience shock from symptoms developed following
the incubation period of between 3-10 days. Dengue shock syndrome is
indicated by rising blood pressure, which is caused by the dengue
virus attacking red blood cells.

Ken said that the hospital's environment also posed a risk of
spreading dengue fever to relatives of dengue patients staying at the
hospital. Therefore, he said, the hospital management would put in
place strict measures to exterminate mosquitoes. "We will use
electric mosquito repellents in all rooms and fumigate every week,"
he said. "We also counsel patients' relatives every Tuesday and
Thursday."

Many patients are still unaware of the need to immediately get tests
done if they experience persistent fevers, Ken said, adding that
these people wrongly believe they have only contracted a common fever
or influenza, he added.

Initial dengue symptoms include a fever that persists for between 3-7
days followed by pain in the bones and red spots on the skin.
