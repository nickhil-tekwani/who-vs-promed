Consider velogenic neurotropic Newcastle disease the most likely cause of
this syndrome. It sounds similar to a VNND outbreak in white pelicans and
cormorants in the early 90s around the Great Lakes region. In Minnesota we
saw the decimation of both birds on a nesting island. Detection of the
virus was very difficult. Both the Minnesota Department of Natural
Resources and the US Fish and Wildlife Service were involved.
I am told that cormorants have been diagnosed with this problem in
California this year.
