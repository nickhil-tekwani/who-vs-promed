A cyanobacteria [blue-green algae] bloom has been detected in the Edmonton-area Chip Lake, according to a Alberta Health Services advisory issued [Thu 17 Aug 2017].

Chip Lake is among 5 Edmonton-area lakes currently under a blue-green algae advisory.

Naturally occurring blue-green algae appears like scum, grass clippings, fuzz or globs on the surface of water, AHS said. It can appear green, blue, brown or even shades of pink and often has a musty smell.

People who come in contact with blue-green algae can experience skin irritation, rash, sore throat, sore red eyes, swollen lips, fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. Symptoms usually appear within one to 3 hours and resolve in 1 to 2 days.

Visitors to the lake are being advised to take precautions. Avoid all contact with blue-green algae and do not swim or wade where the algae are visible.

People may safely eat fish fillets, but should limit eating whole fish or fish trimmings. Pets should not be fed any fish from the lake, AHS said.

Boiling water will not remove the toxins produced by blue-green algae, and alternate sources of drinking water should always be provided for pets and livestock, AHS said.

The advisory for Chip Lake will remain in place until further notice.

Blue-green algae (also known as cyanobacteria) are the only group of algae to be toxic in freshwaters. They are microscopic bacteria living in water, and are capable of photosynthesising, which is why they are often called algae. Though microscopic, when they form colonies and accumulate they can become visible to the naked eye. Blue-green algae can produce potent liver and neurotoxins as well as skin irritants. However, not all blue-green algae are toxic, and even toxic species do not always produce toxins. But telling the difference in toxic and non-toxic species is challenging.

Blue-green algae can pose a risk to human health because of the toxins they produce. These toxins can damage the liver and neurological system of both humans and animals, and in severe cases can cause death. The cell walls of all blue-green algae contain contact irritants which can cause gastrointestinal, skin, eye, and respiratory irritations to humans and animals.
