Americans aged 65 and older who received the 2-dose Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine should get a 3rd booster dose of that vaccine if it has been at least 6 months since completing their vaccination series. That was the recommendation the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) made late yesterday [22 Sep 2021], and it was echoed today during a meeting of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).

In addition to those 65 and older, the FDA authorized booster doses of the Pfizer vaccine for people 18 through 64 who are at high risk of severe COVID-19 or whose institutional or occupational exposure puts them at high risk of severe COVID-19. ACIP agreed with recommending a booster for the 1st group but not the 2nd.

"The FDA amended the [emergency use authorization] for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to allow for a booster dose in certain populations such as healthcare workers, teachers and daycare staff, grocery workers and those in homeless shelters or prisons, among others," said Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock, MD, in a press release.

Addressing ACIP this morning [23 Sep 2021], CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, MD, MPH, said she supported the FDA's decision, and used the example of a young emergency department physician as someone who would benefit from a booster dose.

During the ACIP meetings, however, many experts presented on whether waning protection warranted boosters in otherwise healthy Americans under the age of 65. The goal, they argued, should be reducing hospitalizations, not preventing breakthrough infections.

Members also discussed the problematic logistics of recommending a 3rd dose: Would being fully vaccinated, if over 65, now mean 3 shots, or just 2? And what about Americans over 65 who received the Moderna or Johnson & Johnson vaccines? And does a board recommendation of booster doses signal -- falsely -- that the current vaccines are ineffective?

At the end of the meeting today [23 Sep 2021], the committee voted on 4 questions. They agreed that vaccine boosters should be used for those 65 and older and for those 50-64 who have underlying medical conditions that make them prone to severe COVID-19.

Heated discussion, however, broke out over the 3rd and 4th recommendations. The 3rd recommendation the committee considered was a booster for those 18-49 based on individual benefit and risk given underlying medical conditions. The 4th and final consideration was for those 18 and older who worked in an occupational setting that put them at more risk for COVID-19 infections, including frontline workers, people who live in congregate settings, and caregivers for the immunocompromised.

Those who voted nay said these terms were too broad and allowed for too much gray area in who should get a booster. "We are letting individuals decide vaccine policy," said Sarah Long, MD, professor of pediatrics at Drexel University.

In the end, the 3rd recommendation passed 9-6, and the 4th did not pass, by a 6-9 vote.

The discussion of how and if to implement boosters comes as CDC data show that the United States last week had its slowest week of 1st-dose vaccinations since mid-July [2021]. According to the Washington Post, on 21 Sep 2021, only 21 000 people got their 1st dose, the lowest daily number since December 2020.

The CDC COVID Data Tracker shows 54.9% of Americans are fully vaccinated, and 64% have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine.

Yesterday [22 Sep 2021] the nation reported 132 903 new COVID-19 cases, and 2785 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker. The 7-day average of new cases is 130 592, with 2075 deaths, according to The New York Times tracker.

Other US developments
---------------------
- The pandemic has exacerbated teacher and staff shortages in the nation's public schools, the Associated Press reports.

- Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis yesterday [22 Sep 2021] announced a new "symptom-based" quarantine rule that allows children who've been exposed to COVID-19 in classrooms but aren't showing any symptoms to be sent back to school by parents, according to CNN.

- The latest survey from the American Health Care Association/National Center for Assisted Living shows 99% of nursing homes and 96% of assisted living facilities in the country are facing staffing shortages.

[The symptom-based policy announced by Gov. Ron DeSantis in Florida is extremely problematic since it totally ignores transmission by individuals who are asymptomatic. This policy is irresponsible and will facilitate virus spread.

Weekly COVID-19 testing of asymptomatic students and staff at 3 K-12 public schools in Omaha, Nebraska, roughly doubled the detection rate of symptom-based testing and exceeded that of the rest of the local county, according to a study yesterday [22 Sep 2021] in JAMA Network Open (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784428).

The pilot quality-improvement project, led by University of Nebraska Medical Center scientists and the Omaha Public School District, involved weekly self-collected saliva testing and twice-weekly sampling of school wastewater and air and surfaces of high-risk areas from 9 Nov 2020 to 11 Dec 2020. At that time, all district schools offered hybrid instruction, alternating cohorts for distance and in-person instruction; 50%-60% of students chose in-person learning. Routine staff COVID-19 testing was mandatory, while it was optional for students.

Over the study period, the team tested 2885 saliva samples from 458 employees and 315 students. Routine testing detected 22 SARS-CoV-2 infections in students and 24 in staff members, representing a 1.2% to 7.0% higher case detection rate among students and a 2.1% to 5.3% increase among staff, relative to symptomatic testing. "Compared with conventional reporting in our setting (passive case finding), our results suggest that as many as 9 in 10 student COVID-19 cases and 7 in 10 staff COVID-19 cases may have been missed by conventional reporting mechanisms," the study authors wrote.

A geographic analyses of coronavirus cases districtwide showed higher community risk in zip codes closest to the pilot schools. "The differences between the pilot program case rates and observed community case rates indicate that [such pilot programs] may assist in mitigating school-based transmission risk through informing case isolation, contact tracing, and management of school activities and may serve as a trigger to escalate community-based surveillance, particularly among school-aged children," they wrote.

Most COVID-19 cases among staff were identified within one week of their last negative test result, while half of the student infections were detected 2 or 3 weeks later, indicating more inconsistent student participation, the researchers said.

Staff were, on average, 42.9 years old, 66.2% were women, 68.1% were White, 18.1% were Hispanic, 5.5% were Black, and 7.6% were of other or unknown race. Students, on average, were 14.2 years old, 48.0% were girls, 63.8% were Hispanic, 23.8% were White, 6.3% were Black, and 6.0% were of other or unknown race.

Whole-genome sequencing of saliva samples from 21 coronavirus-infected participants and wastewater sampling from all schools and air samples from 2 choir rooms detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA (not live virus) in 3.3% of 60 air samples and 1.7% of 60 surface samples. There were 2 infection clusters consisting of 2 employees and 2 students at one school.

While the researchers noted that wastewater samples over 2 weeks at one school tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 despite positive saliva test results, "the use of wastewater autosampling instruments for the collection of time-distributed composite wastewater samples may increase sensitivity for case detection and will be further explored," they wrote.

The cost of wastewater sampling was roughly USD 750 per week per school, or 75 cents per person, for a school of 1000 students and staff members, relative to USD 10-50 per person for testing individual or pooled samples.

"Thus, wastewater and other environmental monitoring may ultimately provide cost-effective, building-level surveillance to identify SARS-CoV-2 transmission hotspots and prioritize more resource-intensive individual screening, a strategy that has been successfully pursued in university housing and nursing home settings," the researchers said.

["As a noninvasive, privacy-protecting method for disease surveillance, wastewater testing has helped overcome gaps in clinical testing for COVID-19 due to test kit shortages, false negatives, and the need for people to show up to get tested. To be clear, clinical testing is still needed for an individual's medical care and contact tracing. But for public health management -- meaning decisions that need to be made not just for one sick person but for an entire city or county -- wastewater testing is the way to go" (https://www.statnews.com/2021/06/24/wastewater-testing-infrastructure-improvements-public-health/). - Mod.LK]

[3] Adults: MIS-A (multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults)
Date: Thu 23 Sep 2021
Source: Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/09/news-scan-sep-23-2021


Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults (MIS-A) is a rare but severe hyperinflammatory condition that begins roughly 4 weeks after COVID-19 symptom onset and likely results from an outsized immune response, concludes a systematic review yesterday [22 Sep 2021] in JAMA Network Open (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784427).

Researchers from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conducted a literature review from 1 May 2020 to 25 May 2021, identifying 221 patients around the world diagnosed as having MIS-A. First identified in children (MIS-C) in April 2020, the syndrome has since also been recognized in adults.

MIS-A typically emerges about 4 weeks after COVID-19 symptoms began, producing inflammation and involving a median of 5 nonpulmonary organs, the authors report. Clinical presentations vary, but the organ systems most often affected were hematologic (92%), cardiovascular (87%), gastrointestinal (83%), and respiratory (74%).

30% of 205 patients had myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle, and 25% of 175 had pericardial effusion, or fluid buildup around the heart. 11% of 94 patients were diagnosed as having Kawasaki disease. Of 195 patients, 90% had higher-than-normal concentrations of coagulation and/or inflammation markers, and 5% had arterial or venous thrombosis (blood clots), while 72% of 194 patients had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

Median hospital stay was 8 days, and 57% of patients required intensive care, 47% received respiratory support, and 7% died. 68% of 149 patients reported having a symptomatic coronavirus-like illness a median of 28 days earlier.

Common symptoms included fever (96%), low blood pressure (60%), cardiac dysfunction (54%), shortness of breath (52%), and diarrhea (52%). Median patient age was 21 years, 70% were men, 36% were Black, and 58% had no underlying illness.

The authors noted that it can be difficult to distinguish biphasic COVID-19 from MIS-A because MIS-A is complicated by the occurrence of other types of coronavirus-related inflammation, and much more research is needed. "It is important for the clinical and public health community to suspect and identify MIS-A...by exercising clinical acumen and considering empirical treatment to reduce related morbidity and mortality," they wrote.

Study estimates Israeli COVID vaccination averted thousands of deaths
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Writing in The Lancet Infectious Diseases yesterday [22 Sep 2021], Israeli scientists estimate that, without the national vaccination campaign, Israel would have had triple the number of hospitalizations and deaths compared with what actually occurred during its latest and largest wave of COVID-19, which could have overwhelmed its healthcare system (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(21)00566-1/fulltext).

From 20 Dec 2020 to 10 Apr 2021, Israel launched a massive national COVID-19 vaccination campaign with the 2-dose mRNA vaccine made by Pfizer-BioNTech. Approximately 74% of the country's population aged 16 and older were fully vaccinated by 10 Apr 2021, making Israel's the fastest and most comprehensive vaccination campaign in the world.

Even in the face of rising breakthrough cases caused by the delta (B1617.2) variant and evidence of some waning protection against mild infections, the study authors estimate the vaccination campaign averted 158 665 SARS-CoV infections (95% confidence interval, 144 640 to 172 690), 24 597 hospitalizations (18 942 to 30 252), 17 432 severe or critical hospitalizations (12 770 to 22 094), and 5532 deaths (3085 to 7982) during the study period.

During that period, Israel reported 13 338 hospitalization (8429 of which were severe or critical), and 2859 deaths from COVID-19.

In a commentary on the study, Frank Sandmann, PhD, and Mark Jit, PhD, MPH, said the research, "documents the immense success that rapid COVID-19 vaccine roll-out had in terms of reducing COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality at the population level" (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(21)00616-2/fulltext).

https://www.dawn.com/news/1647713/ncoc-lifts-additional-restrictions-in-6-districts-of-punjab-kp


As the cases of COVID-19 continue to decrease across the country, the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) on Tuesday [21 Sep 2021] decided to lift additional restrictions in 6 districts of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

However, general non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) will remain enforced across the country until [30 Sep 2021]. The situation will be reviewed on [28 Sep 2021].

The NCOC had on [4 Sep 2021] enforced restrictions in 24 districts of Punjab, KP [Khyber Pakhtunkhwa], and Islamabad. The restrictions included a ban on indoor gatherings and intercity transport and closure of educational institutions and indoor gyms. Initially, the restrictions were imposed until [12 Sep 2021] but later extended to [15 Sep 2021].

The NCOC later decided to lift the restrictions in 18 districts on [16 Sep 2021] but continued to enforce these in 6 high disease prevalence districts.

During a meeting chaired by Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Asad Umar on Tuesday [21 Sep 2021], the NCOC decided to lift additional restrictions in the remaining 6 districts -- Lahore, Faisalabad, Multan, Sargodha, and Gujrat in Punjab and Bannu in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. All educational institutions in these districts will open from [23 Sep 2021] and follow staggered opening (50% attendance, 3 days a week).

According to a document, general NPIs will remain enforced across the country until [30 Sep 2021] under which businesses of less essential services will be closed at 10 pm. However, petrol pumps, pharmacies, medical facilities, vaccination centres, clinics, milk shops, and tandoors will remain open. There will be one closed day a week and indoor and outdoor dining will be allowed till midnight. However, indoor dining and marriages will be allowed only for vaccinated people.

Public transport will be run at 50% and trains at 70% occupancy. However, cinemas will remain closed.

The policy of controlled tourism for vaccinated individuals will continue and will be ensured by the federating units. The ban on serving meals/snacks during in-flight journeys for domestic airlines will continue.

Meanwhile, the Islamabad High Court on Tuesday [22 Sep 2021] dismissed a petition suggesting that people should have the right to decide whether they want to get inoculated or not.

Chief Justice Athar Minallah observed that people across the globe had been struggling to overcome the enormous challenges for the last 2 years due to COVID-19.

"It is noted that unvaccinated persons are likely to impede the endeavors of the state to safeguard its citizens from life-threatening harm. For the reasons above, the prayers sought in the instant petition are not justiciable nor the rights of the petitioner have been infringed. The petition is, therefore, accordingly dismissed," the court ruled.

We are now, most probably, on the last lap of more than a month-long period of quarantine curfew. During the past several weeks and months we have often focused on the rapidly spreading COVID-19 pandemic and the resultant increase in the number of new cases and related deaths. In such a situation, Monday's [20 Sep 2021] lead story in the Daily Mirror headlined, 'Major decline in COVID cases and hospitalisation' was an occasion for Sri Lankans to heave a sigh of relief.

Infectious Diseases Hospital (IDH) Senior Consultant Dr Ananda Wijewickrama said the recently imposed quarantine curfew with its lockdowns, travel restrictions, and preventive measures had been one of the main reasons for the sharp decrease in the number of new cases and deaths. He said it was imperative to maintain the hard-gained momentum in the future as well and stressed the importance of getting vaccinated as soon as possible without falling prey to the misinformation spread by anti-vaxxers.

The number of daily COVID-19 cases which averaged above 2000 during the past few weeks had on Tuesday [21 Sep 2021] dropped to 1321 and the number of deaths to 66, for the 1st time in more than a month.

Meanwhile, Prof Neelika Malavige of the Sri Jayewardenepura University's Department of Immunology and Molecular Sciences and the Faculty of Medical Sciences said there was no specific difference between the COVID-19 variant in Sri Lanka and in other countries. However, she said the vaccines would provide the necessary protection from any of the variants that might invade Sri Lanka.

Nevertheless, at the end of the day, we must not lose sight of the fact that each of us is responsible for each other's safety and that none of us are safe until all of us are safe. Vaccination being the best option to beat the viral infection, please get vaccinated without delay.

The South Asian COVID-19 situation, according to data from Worldometer (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) as of 24 Sep 2021 at 2:50 AM GMT:
Country: Total cases / Total deaths / Deaths per million population
India: 33 593 492 / 446 399 / 320
Bangladesh: 1 548 320 / 27 337 / 164
Pakistan: 1 232 595 / 27 432 / 121
Nepal: 788 769 / 11 072/ 372

Afghanistan: 154 960 / 7198 / 180
Maldives: 84 103 / 229 / 415
Bhutan: 2599 / 3 / 4

Over the last 7 days, 212 970, 10 117, 16 774, 6780, 11 346, and 473 COVID-19 cases were detected in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Afghanistan, respectively, compared with 217 518, 13 313, 21 623, 7402, 21 058, and 525 in the preceding 7 days, revealing almost a stable trend in India, the continuation of the sharp declining trend in Bangladesh, a decreasing trend in Pakistan, a decreasing trend in Nepal, the continuation of the sharp decreasing trend in Sri Lanka over the last 2 weeks and a stable trend in Afghanistan with a very low number of reported cases.

Live Situational Analysis on COVID-19 cases in Sri Lanka can be seen at https://hpb.health.gov.lk/covid19-dashboard/. The curve of the disease in Sri Lanka is now falling sharply. This could be the effect of the country-wide lockdown, initially imposed from the night of 20 Aug 2021 to 30 Aug 2021 which has been extended in 4 phases until 1 Oct 2021 (https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sri-lanka-extends-covid-19-lockdown-till-october-1/article36511654.ece). The total number of laboratory-confirmed cases has crossed the milestone of 0.5 million in the country. However, the number of COVID-19 vaccine doses administered in Sri Lanka rose to 25 110 877 as of 24 Sep 2021 (https://tradingeconomics.com/sri-lanka/coronavirus-vaccination-total).

The National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) in Pakistan enforced local restrictions including bans on indoor gatherings, intercity transport, closure of educational institutions and indoor gyms in 24 districts of Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), and Islamabad on 4 Sep 2021, as indicated in item [4] above, to curb the spread of the virus. The restriction imposed was initially for until 12 Sep 2021 which was extended later up to 15 Sep 2021. However, as the disease situation showed no sign of escalation, the restrictions imposed were lifted from 18 of the districts on 16 Sep 2021, and from the other 6 on 21 Sep 2021.
