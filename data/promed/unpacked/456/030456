NSW Health is urging the community to stay vigilant and take precautions against mosquito bites after an 8th NSW resident has been confirmed to have Japanese encephalitis (JE). The confirmed case is a man aged in his 50s from the Temora area in the Riverina region. He was treated in hospital before being discharged and is continuing to recover in the community.

With the evolving nature of the JE situation across the country, NSW Health is transitioning the way it reports cases in NSW residents from today [18 Mar 2022]. In line with national reporting structures, NSW Health will finalise any new cases and locations each day at 4pm, and report them the next day on the NSW Health website.

The JE virus is spread by mosquitoes and can infect animals and humans. The virus cannot be transmitted between humans, and it cannot be caught by eating pork or other pig products.

There is no specific treatment for JE, which can cause severe neurological illness with headache, convulsions and reduced consciousness in some cases.

The best thing people throughout the state can do to protect themselves and their families against JE is to take steps to avoid mosquito bites. Simple actions you can take include:

- Avoid going outdoors during peak mosquito times, especially at dawn and dusk, and close to wetland and bushland areas.
- Wear long sleeves and pants outdoors (reduce skin exposure). Also wear shoes and socks where possible. There are insecticides (e.g., permethrin) available for treating clothing for those spending extended periods outdoors.
- Apply repellent to all areas of exposed skin, especially those that contain DEET, picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus, which are the most effective against mosquitoes. The strength of a repellent determines the duration of protection, with the higher concentrations providing longer periods of protection. Always check the label for reapplication times.
- Reapply repellent after swimming. The duration of protection from repellent is also reduced with perspiration, such as during strenuous activity or hot weather, so it may need to be reapplied more frequently.
- Apply the sunscreen first and then apply the repellent. Be aware that DEET-containing repellents may decrease the sun protection factor (SPF) of sunscreens, so you may need to reapply the sunscreen more frequently.
- For children in particular -- most skin repellents are safe for use on children aged 3 months and older when used according to directions, although some formulations are only recommended for children aged 12 months and older -- always check the product. Infants aged less than 3 months can be protected from mosquitoes by using an infant carrier draped with mosquito netting that is secured along the edges.
- If camping, ensure the tent has fly screens to prevent mosquitoes entering.
- Mosquito coils and other devices that release insecticides can assist reducing mosquito bites but should be used in combination with topical insect repellents.
- Reduce all water-holding containers around the home where mosquitoes could breed. Mosquitoes only need a small amount of liquid to breed.

Key points
----------
- There have been 8 confirmed Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) cases in South Australia
- 5 remain in hospital, and another 2 encephalitis cases are under investigation
- Health authorities have now confirmed a suspected fatal case

South Australian (SA) health authorities have confirmed 4 further cases of the mosquito-borne disease Japanese encephalitis, including the state's 1st death. The death was of a person who authorities had earlier suspected may have died with the disease. SA Health said there were now 8 total Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) cases in the state. Of these, remain in hospital, while 2 have been discharged, SA Health wellbeing director Chris Lease said.

"We can confirm that one of the additional cases includes the person who we previously reported had sadly passed away earlier this month [March 2022]," Dr Lease said. Another 2 cases of encephalitis remain under investigation as potential JEV cases. "It is crucial that we all continue to take extra precautions against mosquitoes and continue to 'fight the bite,'" Dr Lease said.

Most people infected with so-called "flaviviruses" such as JEV, Kokobera virus, West Nile virus and Murray Valley encephalitis do not suffer symptoms or develop a mild fever. But a small proportion will develop encephalitis, which can be fatal or cause long-term neurological damage. Symptoms of encephalitis include confusion, headaches, neck stiffness, tremors, drowsiness and seizures.

Young children have a higher risk of developing encephalitis if infected with JEV. A 4-month-old baby was last week confirmed to have contracted the virus in Victoria.

JEV has also been detected at more than 2 dozen piggeries across 4 states: Queensland, NSW, Victoria and South Australia.

Dr Lease has urged members of the public to try to stop mosquitoes coming indoors and take precautions including insect repellent.

Earlier this week, authorities urged vigilance if people are using mosquito coils, after 2 house fires in Adelaide were linked to the devices this week. "Do not leave them burning unattended and always remember to extinguish them carefully by breaking the smouldering end off, immersing it in water and storing it away from the house to completely cool," Dr Lease said.

Key points
----------
- An expert said the virus had probably been circulating for months before it was recently detected in Australian piggeries
- Biosecurity Queensland organised testing last month [February 2022] when a veterinarian reported increased "reproductive problems" at a piggery in the state's south
- Associate Professor Devine predicted a spike in mosquito-borne disease in Australia as weather patterns changed

The mosquito-borne Japanese encephalitis virus has been discovered at a 2nd Queensland piggery, with an expert warning the potentially deadly disease is most likely "here to stay".

The virus was diagnosed in 18 Australians this month [March 2022] and has been found in 28 piggeries across 4 states -- Queensland, NSW, Victoria and South Australia -- the 1st time an outbreak has occurred outside Australia's far north. Of the people infected, 2 have died.

There are 2 Queensland piggeries that have been affected, including one in the Goondiwindi region. No details have been revealed about the location of the 2nd.

A woman in her 60s with the virus remains in a critical but stable condition in The Prince Charles Hospital, in Brisbane's north. She is the 1st locally acquired Queensland case since 1998.

QIMR [Queensland Institute of Medical Research] Berghofer Medical Research Institute senior mosquito scientist Greg Devine has called for the establishment of a national surveillance system to improve the detection and management of mosquito-borne diseases, including Japanese encephalitis, in the wake of the outbreak. Associate Professor Devine said the virus had probably been circulating for months before it was recently detected in Australian piggeries.

"I think what this Japanese encephalitis outbreak has told us is that our surveillance systems are inadequate," he said. "The fact that it seemed to turn up all at once across many states in dozens of piggeries, and then to have an unprecedented number of human cases emerge as well, suggests that it has been around for quite a while and that we've just missed it. We've been rather overwhelmed by other things like COVID-19 over the last couple of years. But it does mean that people have disinvested in the other surveillance programs. People haven't been paying as much attention. It wasn't on anybody's radar."

Biosecurity Queensland organised testing last month [February] when a veterinarian reported increased "reproductive problems" at a piggery in the state's south. Stillborn piglets can be a sign of Japanese encephalitis. Piglets infected after birth can develop neurological signs in the first 6 months of life. Symptoms can include hind-limb paralysis. Adult sows do not typically show signs of disease.

The virus is transmitted to pigs, horses and humans through mosquito bites. It cannot pass from human to human or from horses. Pigs and wild birds are known as "amplifying hosts," playing a role in spreading the disease via mosquitoes. Commercially produced pork and other pig products are safe to consume.

Japanese encephalitis is generally harmless in humans, but in less than 1% of cases, people can develop encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain, which is fatal in about 30% of patients.

Associate Professor Devine speculated the outbreak was triggered by the warm, wet La Niña weather pattern encouraging infected water birds into areas they rarely venture into and coinciding with vast numbers of mosquitoes.

The most likely vector in Australia is a mosquito dubbed _Cutux annulirostris_, a "large, brown mosquito that loves freshwater. Sometimes they will be in proximity to a piggery," he said. "Pigs can carry very high burdens of the virus and can easily infect mosquitoes. That allows spillover into humans."

Associate Professor Devine predicted a spike in mosquito-borne disease in Australia as weather patterns changed. "There's no doubt that our temperatures are going to increase, and our weather patterns are going to become more unpredictable," he said. "Our future is a warmer one, full of flooding events where the water hangs around for quite a long time, and there's no doubt that the risk of these kinds of diseases, like Japanese encephalitis...increases dramatically."

The head of QIMR Berghofer's mosquito control laboratory called for a nationally coordinated response bringing together health, agriculture and wildlife ecologists to better understand the problem. "We don't have information on migrating bird patterns that we need at the moment," Associate Professor Devine said. "It's possible that feral pigs have got a role in there somewhere too. Back in the 1990s, some surveys did show that feral pigs were certainly more than capable of keeping the virus circulating geographically in an area. We've got millions of feral pigs. But we don't have a great surveillance program for feral pigs in terms of their role in Japanese encephalitis."

Pig producers who notice signs of Japanese encephalitis should immediately contact a veterinarian, Biosecurity Queensland on 13 25 23 or call the Emergency Animal Disease Watch Hotline on 1800 675 888.

[It seems odd that in all the reports of JE virus transmission in the 4 states that ProMED has received, there have been no mentions of mosquito surveillance and testing for JE virus until the above report. Historically, Australia has had an active medical entomology community that knows where the vector mosquitoes are breeding as the wet season progresses. In informal communication with previous ProMED moderator and arbovirologist Dr. Charles Calisher, we have wondered if there was any routine vector mosquito trapping and testing underway to identify areas of JE virus transmission before cases in humans and piggeries appear. Dr. Devine's comments above suggest that a vector mosquito surveillance program has not been in place but is needed for JE and other arboviruses. - Mod.TY

[In response to an earlier question about tests being used to identify and diagnose a case, Dr. Lai provided the following information that permits differentiation of Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus from other flavivirus with which JE virus might cross-react.]

Australian Government Department of Health
------------------------------------------
Japanese encephalitis virus infection case definition - V1.1
This document contains the case definitions for Japanese encephalitis virus infection, which is nationally notifiable within Australia. This definition should be used to determine whether a case should be notified.

Under the national case definition (https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/cda-surveil-nndss-casedefs-cd_je.htm), a confirmed case requires laboratory definitive evidence AND clinical evidence.

Laboratory definitive evidence
------------------------------
1. Isolation of Japanese encephalitis virus OR
2. Detection of Japanese encephalitis virus by nucleic acid testing OR
3.IgG seroconversion or a significant increase in antibody level or a 4-fold or greater rise in titre of Japanese encephalitis virus-specific IgG proven by neutralisation or another specific test, with no history of recent Japanese encephalitis vaccination OR
4. Detection of Japanese encephalitis virus-specific IgM in cerebrospinal fluid, in the absence of IgM to Murray Valley encephalitis, West Nile/Kunjin and dengue viruses OR
5. Detection of Japanese encephalitis virus-specific IgM in serum in the absence of IgM to Murray Valley encephalitis, West Nile/Kunjin and dengue viruses, with no history of recent Japanese encephalitis vaccination.

Confirmation of laboratory result by a 2nd arbovirus reference laboratory is required if the case appears to have been acquired in mainland Australia.
