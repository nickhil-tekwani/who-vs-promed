A 10-year-old boy from southern Kampot province has been confirmed positive for the H5N1 avian influenza virus, bringing the number of the cases to 24 so far this year [2013], the World Health Organization and the Cambodian Health Ministry stated in a joint statement on Friday [8 Nov 2013]. The boy was confirmed positive for human H5N1 avian influenza on Thursday [7 Nov 2013] after he was admitted to the Kantha Bopha Hospital in Phnom Penh with fever, cough, sore throat, a distended abdomen, and dyspnea. "The boy has been treated with Tamiflu. Currently, his condition is critical," the statement said. Only 12 out of the 24 cases this year [2013] have survived. "Investigations in his village found that a month before the 10-year-old boy's illness, about 30 chickens had died suddenly in the village, and the boy helped carry dead chickens for his brother who was preparing a meal from them," the statement said.

Health Minister Mam Bunheng said [H5N1] bird flu remains a serious threat to the health of all Cambodians and children seem to be most vulnerable and are at high risk. "Once again, I'd like to appeal to parents and guardians to keep children away from sick or dead poultry and make sure children wash their hands with soap and water after any contact with poultry," he said.

H5N1 avian influenza virus is a virus that usually spreads between sick poultry, but it can sometimes spread from poultry to humans, according to the World Health Organization. Cambodia is seeing the worst outbreak of the virus this year [2013] since it was first identified in 2004. To date, the country has reported 45 human cases of the virus, killing 31 people.

[A total of 15 countries have reported human cases of avian H5N1 influenza since the 1st human cases appeared in 2003. Now, of these, only 6 countries are still reporting cases of H5N1 and of these 6, only Cambodia is reporting significant numbers of cases (see: WHO table of cumulative number of confirmed human cases for avian influenza A(H5N1) reported to WHO, 2003-2013 at http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/EN_GIP_20131008CumulativeNumberH5N1cases.pdf). Of the 35 confirmed human cases of H5N1 avian influenza virus recorded globally during 2013, a total of 24 have occurred in Cambodia. The fatality in 2013 remains 13. The majority of cases in Cambodia have been children and as yet Cambodian authorities seem unable to address this problem.
