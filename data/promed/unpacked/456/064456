Abstract
--------
We report detecting infectious Toscana virus in the seminal fluid of a 25-year-old man from Italy returning from Elba Island. The presence of infectious virus in human semen adds Toscana virus to the long list of viruses detected in this genital fluid and indicates a potential for sexual transmission.

[Background]
Toscana virus (TOSV) is an arthropodborne virus, belonging to the genus _Phlebovirus_, that was first isolated in Monte Argentario in 1971 from the sand flies _Phlebotomus perniciosus_ and _P. perfiliewi_. Some years later, TOSV was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of 2 patients with meningitis, confirming its role in the etiology of this neurologic disorder. To date, phylogenetic analysis has distinguished 3 genotypes of TOSV (lineages A, B, and C), which are differentially distributed in the countries of the Mediterranean Basin. TOSV A is the most common cause of summer viral meningitis in central Italy and France and has a frequency eclipsing that of enteroviruses.

Conclusions
--------------
Most human TOSV infections are asymptomatic or appear as a nonspecific febrile disease. Neuroinvasive disease can occur, and, although self-resolving in most cases, TOSV infection of the central nervous system can be severe. In this study, we describe unusual long-term TOSV viremia and detection and persistence of TOSV in human semen. We could not recover infectious TOSV from blood samples, probably because of high levels of specific antibodies; the persistent low-level viremia could also derive from residual virus in the cellular components of blood.

We detected viral RNA in both acellular and cellular fractions of semen and isolated infectious TOSV from seminal plasma. Moreover, we detected the viral RNA in both spermatozoa and round seminal cells; both might include potential targets of TOSV infection. Nevertheless, the exact tropism for the genital tract and the origin of TOSV in semen remain to be elucidated. The patient reported no symptoms of genital inflammation, despite persistence of TOSV in genital secretions and the observation of sperm abnormalities (scarce mobility of spermatozoa was observed throughout the study period). To date, there have been few reports on genital involvement in men infected by TOSV; reported manifestations have included testicular pain, orchitis, and epididymitis. The finding of TOSV in human semen puts TOSV in the long list of viruses detected in this fluid. illuminating the potential for sexual transmission as an alternative route of viral spread. In this case, we did not find evidence of TOSV sexual transmission to the patient's partner, whose serum, blood, saliva, urine, and vaginal fluid never tested positive for TOSV RNA. Moreover, despite the presence of specific IgM, we observed no IgG seroconversion during the 3-month follow-up. All these observations suggest tropism of TOSV for the male genital tract that warrants further investigation.

[Roland Hübner is thanked for sending in this report.

Although Toscana virus (TOSV) has been detected over a wide geographic area in Europe, human cases of infection have been reported relatively rarely. The virus is transmitted by phlebotomine sand flies, but the above report documents presence of the virus in semen, raising the possibility that sexual transmission could occur as well. The epidemiological significance of sexual transmission of this virus awaits further investigation. The very infrequent occurrence of cases will provide few instances for future study unless more infections are, in fact, taking place but going undiagnosed. In an earlier post, Mod.CP commented, "TOSV is endemic and should not be considered anymore as an emerging pathogen but rather as a neglected pathogen." - Mod.TY
