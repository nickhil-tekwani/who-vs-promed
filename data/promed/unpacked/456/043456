[It has now been 29 days since the last report of a locally transmitted case in Wuhan, over 2 incubation periods since the last locally acquired case was confirmed in Wuhan (an outbreak is usually declared over/transmission declared interrupted after 2 incubation periods without newly confirmed cases). Can we cautiously say that transmission has been interrupted in Wuhan? It has now been 39 days since restrictions were lifted in Guangdong and Heilongjiang, and it appears as though low level local transmission was established in both Heilongjiang and Guangdong over the past 24 days or so, albeit the numbers of reported cases from both Guangdong and Heilongjiang are decreasing and, no newly confirmed cases were reported in the past 24 hours.

According to the report above, a total of 82 877 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 4633 deaths, representing an increase of 2 cases in the 24 hours since yesterday's (1 May 2020) report. The newly reported cases are imported. In Hong Kong, where numbers of newly confirmed cases had been reported daily, there were no new cases. And Macau has reported no newly confirmed cases and 3 new confirmed cases in Taiwan. There have been a total of 1672 imported cases.

As best as I can decipher from the machine-translated report above, there were 12 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic people in the past 24 hours, including 2 imported cases. There were no cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The total number of asymptomatic individuals currently under observation (and isolation) is 968, and 98 of these are importations from abroad. It would be helpful to know what proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals went on to be symptomatic to start developing projections of actual infection rates and adjust reported case fatality ratios accordingly. It is apparent that there is most likely thorough contact tracing and testing to explain the daily reports of asymptomatic infections in addition to the screening of individuals arriving from overseas.

As reported on 24 Mar 2020, China ended the lockdown in Hubei and elsewhere, and ended it in Wuhan on 7 Apr 2020. There is much caution and skepticism in the media over the reality of the zero case reports. The world is watching carefully to see whether this is safe timing. There do appear to be chains of transmission ongoing in Guangdong (perhaps approaching interruption) and Heilongjiang that are of concern, but clearly the most concerning are the imported cases returning to China.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 209 328 cases, including 28 236 deaths, up from 207 428 cases and 28 236 deaths reported on 1 May 2020. The 24-hour change between 1 May 2020 and 2 May 2020 was 1900 newly confirmed cases, compared with 1965 newly confirmed cases between 30 Apr 2020 and 1 May 2020. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are experiencing a decline.

Cases continue to be concentrated in the northern part of the country, in Lombardy, the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Piedmont. These 4 provinces combined account for 71.5% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Lombardy is the main contributor, representing 28% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. In addition to Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Piedmont, one other province (Liguria) has reported more than 100 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Seven provinces reported less than 10 newly confirmed cases, and another 7 provinces reported less than 50 newly confirmed cases, all signs of decreasing local transmission.

There is an excellent interactive map at http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1 to visualize the caseloads per region in near real time.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces, where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was expanded to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of non-essential businesses. It is now 38 days since the start of the lockdown in the north and 36 days since the countrywide lockdown. The lockdown is being extended until 3 May 2020 (see ProMED-mail post 20200411.7211958 for details). All eyes will be on Italy as lockdown restrictions are phased out.

A 90-year-old woman from western Iran has defeated coronavirus (COVID-19) after 3 weeks of resistance to the deadly virus, doctors said on Sunday [3 May 2020].

The senior citizen who lives in Iran's Ilam Province was discharged from Mostafa Khomeini hospital, reported IRNA news agency.

Earlier, a 106-year-old patient from Qom, a 98-year-old lady from Mashad, a 97-year-old woman from Qom, an 89-year-old woman from Dezful as well as an 85-year-old woman from north of Iran had overcome the disease.

Iran has taken numerous steps to stop the spread of the disease, ranging from shutting down schools and universities to cancelling cultural and religious gatherings. It is also constantly disinfecting and sanitizing public places.

Head of Iran's Health Ministry's Public Relations Office Kianoush Jahanpour said on Saturday [2 May 2020] that 77 350 people out of a total of 96 448 infected with the coronavirus have survived and recovered while 6156 have unfortunately succumbed to death.

Jahanpour said that 802 new affected cases have been detected since yesterday [1 May 2020]. Over the last 24 hours, 65 people died due to the deadly virus, he added.

The Iranian official noted that 2787 cases are in critical condition. He went on to say that 484 541 tests have so far been carried out in Iran.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 1 160 774, including 67 444 deaths, an increase from 1 131 280 cases and 65 766 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York state, with 315 222 (27.5%) cumulative case reports and 3991 (20.5%) newly confirmed cases over the past 24 hours, is clearly the epicenter of the outbreak in the USA, although case reporting elsewhere is increasing.

Daily reported case counts are high in New Jersey (2527 - 12.9%), Illinois (2450 - 12.5% of total), Massachusetts (1952 - 10.0%), Pennsylvania (1273 - 6.5%), and Texas (1249 - 6.4%). In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by New Jersey, Massachusetts, Illinois, California, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida, Texas, and Connecticut.

Repeating from yesterday (2 May 2020), more sobering, if you treat each state as a country and insert them in descending cumulative case counts, New York state would be number 1 followed by Spain, Italy, UK, France, Germany, Turkey, New Jersey, Russia, and Iran as number 10. Number 11 would be Brazil, 12 China, 13 Massachusetts, 14 Illinois, 15 Canada, 16 California, 17 Pennsylvania, 18 Belgium, 19 Peru, and 20 Netherlands. Seven US states are in the top 20 in terms of cumulative case counts (concept from - Mod.LXL). Even more sobering is that New York City would be between Germany and France.

The US military has confirmed 7145 cumulative cases, with no new confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. The Veteran Affairs reported 9239 cumulative cases and 224 new cases today (2 May 2020). There have been 2268 cases reported from federal prisons (83 new cases in the past 24 hours) and 2307 cases reported from the Navajo Nation (166 newly reported cases in the past 24 hours). Puerto Rico has reported 1757 cases (182 new cases in the past 24 hours).

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) has a growth curve and a table giving demographics (age and ethnicity) where known.

[As per the WHO Situation Report 98 from 27 Apr 2020 (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200427-sitrep-98-covid-19.pdf and in COVID-19 update (136): UK NHS increased testing, Brazil, WHO 20200428.7274496) Spain has been reporting only PCR-positive confirmations and not antibody based, effective 25 Apr 2020. The antibody confirmed cases are shown in the graph accompanying Table 1, but tabular form showing data by province is not available. That being said, Spain is 2nd globally in terms of the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19. There were 1147 newly confirmed cases by PCR in the past 24 hours, bringing the PCR confirmed cumulative total to 216 582 [245 567] as compared with 215 216 PCR [242 988] confirmed cases yesterday (1 May 2020).

The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population continues to decrease and is now 57.88, a continual slow decrease over the past 24 days from a high of 214.43 on 7 Apr 2020 to 57.88 today (2 May 2020). Spain has the highest case count in Europe and is 2nd globally behind the USA in terms of absolute numbers of cases.
