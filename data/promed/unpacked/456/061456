Cholera Outbreak Kills 14 In Kenya
September 15, 1997
NAIROBI, Kenya (PANA) - Fourteen people are feared dead following an
outbreak of cholera in parts of Migori, Homa bay and Rachuonyo districts in
Kenya's Nyanza province over the last three days.
Reports reaching here Monday from the Lake Victoria port town of Kisumu
indicated that the most affected area was Karungu, about 150 km south of
the provincial capital, where 12 people have reportedly died. Over 40
others are admitted in local dispensaries and health centers.
The affected areas are on or near the Kenya-Tanzania border. Confirming
reports of the outbreak Monday, the director of medical services Dr. James
Mwanzia said there has been few cases of cholera in Homa Bay and Migori
which started a few weeks ago.
However, he could not immediately confirm the death toll saying health
personnel were out in the field and they were yet to brief him.
Mwanzia said the index case was established to have originated from the
neighbouring Tanzania.
