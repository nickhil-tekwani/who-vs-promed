Swollen shoot disease moves west to attack Ivorian cocoa
--------------------------------------------------------
Scientists working in Soubre, one of the key cocoa growing regions in
Ivory Coast, have confirmed an outbreak of swollen shoot disease at
several sites. Farmers are concerned about a disease that has killed
off hundreds of trees, often relatively young. "I can confirm the
existence of swollen shoot disease in the zone of Soubre," a local
agroscientist said. Another cocoa official confirmed one of the
affected zones was Grand-Zattri, to the north of Soubre town.

The disease has already had an impact on cocoa farms in the central
zone of Bouafle and Sinfra [see ProMED-mail post 20090327.1196].
However, this is the 1st time the outbreak has been reported further
west in the main production zones. As yet the authorities are keeping
the outbreak under wraps, but it has been said that they were
considering a replanting scheme with newer, more disease-resistant
varieties.

New varieties planted in the Bouafle region by the National Agronomic
Research Center (CNRA) have had mixed results. "Farmers are seeing a
decline in production; those who could harvest 5 sacks, today can't
get anything. It's worse with the new CNRA varieties. When they're
planted on the contaminated sites, several weeks later they go yellow,
the leaves fall, and they die," said a farmer in the Bouafle region.

[Swollen shoot disease of cocoa is caused by _Cacao swollen shoot
virus_ (CSSV; genus _Badnavirus_) and can lead to severe crop losses.
CSSV is thought to have been transferred to cocoa from West African
forest trees. Symptoms vary with different viral strains from severe
effects on shoots and roots to no symptoms at all. The virus is spread
by several species of mealybugs (_Pseudococcidae_) and may also be
transmitted by grafting and mechanical inoculation. Seed transmission
is also suspected.

Disease management relies on phytosanitation and clean plant material.
Most affected countries require the removal of all infected trees and
their neighbours. Mealybugs are difficult to control, and native
forests serve as pathogen reservoirs. Breeding programmes for virus-
or vector-resistant crop varieties have been initiated.

In 2008, Cote d'Ivoire launched a 2-year project to fight swollen
shoot (see ProMED-mail post 20080302.0860). The risks to the main
western growing areas were thought to be lower because of recent
replanting and rejuvenation programmes. However, doubts have been cast
on the CSSV resistance levels (at least under field conditions) of the
new varieties used in these programmes.
