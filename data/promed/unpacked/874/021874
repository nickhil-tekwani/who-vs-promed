A South Korean provincial government said Tuesday [26 Sep 2017] that the avian influenza (AI) virus had been found in bird excretions in the southern part of the country.in

The government of North Gyeongsang Province said the H7N7 strain of avian influenza was detected the excretions of wild birds in Yeongcheon, 344 kilometers south of Seoul.

The Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs will check to see if the virus is highly pathogenic by Friday though most of the H7N7-type viruses found in North Gyeongsang Province have turned out to be weakly pathogenic, the provincial government said.

The Gyeongbuk government and Yeongcheon city have designated everything within a 10 kilometer radius of the virus detection point under quarantine, banning poultry farms from relocating hens, ducks and geese until the examination is completed.

In the Gyeongbuk area, a highly pathogenic strain of avian flu broke out in November last year.

[Among Korean wild aquatic birds. the H7N7 subtype is the most commonly isolated. As the text anticipates, the virus reported here probably has low pathogenicity (LPAI). Phylogenetic analyses of Korean H7 viruses demonstrated that they derived from a mixture of Eurasian-like avian lineages of influenza viruses, further highlighting the dynamic gene pool of viruses in this region. Results from these analyses demonstrated the occurrence of active genetic reassortment events in avian influenza viruses in migratory birds. Some LPAI viruses, most notably of the H5 and H7 subtypes, may become highly pathogenic viruses due to mutational changes that occur via various mechanisms - Mod. PMB
