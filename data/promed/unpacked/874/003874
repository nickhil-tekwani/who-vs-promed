A quarantine on koi carp has been imposed at a popular Peterborough fishing spot after an outbreak of the deadly herpes virus.

Officials have banned all movement of fish in and around Railway Lakes in Peterborough, after the discovery of the koi herpesvirus (KHV).

It affects all varieties of common and ornamental carp and can result in high mortality rates.

The only way to get rid of the virus is to kill every other fish in the pond to stop the disease from spreading.

Like other forms of herpes, KHV is spread through touch so any fish that come into contact with water where an infected fish has been swimming are at risk.

KHV does not affect humans.

[Koi herpesvirus disease (KHD) has been reported throughout the world. The disease is transmitted by fish-to-fish contact and it is also possible that the disease can spread through contaminated water, nets, and other equipment. Like other herpesviruses, KHD has the capacity to remain latent in the infected fish and become activated and cause disease when some stressors trigger it. More information on KHD is found in OIE Aquatic Manual chapter (2009 update), which is available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/aahm/current/2.3.06_KHVD.pdf.
