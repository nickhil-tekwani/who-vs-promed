["The causal organism of European foulbrood of honey bees is the bacterium _Melissococcus plutonius_. The identification of its presence by the observation of signs of disease in the field is unreliable. The most usual and obvious sign is the death of larvae shortly before they are due to be sealed in their cells, but this may be for reasons other than European foulbrood. Most infected colonies display few visible signs, which themselves often quickly abate spontaneously before the end of each active season. Infection remains enzootic within individual colonies because of mechanical contamination of the honeycombs by the durable organism. Recurrences of disease can therefore be expected in subsequent years. The disease is widely distributed worldwide and is an increasing problem in some areas.

"Examination, by high-power microscopy, of suitable preparations of larval remains for the presence of lanceolate cocci is adequate for most practical purposes, especially when it is done by experienced individuals. Traditionally the diagnosis of European foulbrood is done by isolating and identifying the causative organism, which can be differentiated quite readily from all other bacteria associated with bees by its fastidious cultural requirements. The isolated bacterium can be identified and differentiated by means of simple tube agglutination tests. A single-step conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a hemi-nested PCR are available. Real-time PCRs have also been developed. These methods permit direct analysis of larvae, adult bees and honey bee products.

"No tests for detecting antibodies in bees are available.

"There are no vaccines available.
