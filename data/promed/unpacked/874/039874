Late blight ruins potato cultivation in Bankura
-----------------------------------------------
Potato cultivation has gone down in most areas of Bankura this year
[2009}. The agricultural authority has identified the disease 'late
blight' as the cause behind the ruin of thousands of hectares of
potato crops. According to principal agricultural officer of Bankura
Mr Ajit Das: "We predict only 60 percent of the average yearly yield
this season, and are yet to estimate the full extent of the damage."

The main affected areas fall under Taldangra, Joypur, Sonamukhi,
Patrasayar, Kotulpur, Raipur, and Indas blocks. Many farmers have had
to switch occupations, or supplement income. A senior official said:
"The temperature has risen to abnormal heights for the winter season.
Also, unusually foggy weather has worsened the situation due to the
large amount of dew dropped on the cultivation."

Aside from late blight, the yield of potato crop has suffered from
adverse effects caused by a medicine named [Dithane] M45 cultivated
by a Punjab based agro firm to combat fungal infection in the
potatoes. According to agriculture department officials, "The
anti-fungal medicine has been lessening the basic yield of potatoes,
adding to the farmers' problems. We have sent samples of the medicine
to be tested at a state run laboratory in Midnapore."

According to Mr Bablu Santra, Patrasayar agriculture development
officer: "It is destroying the crop instead of removing the fungal
infection. The farmers are facing an unprecedented crisis following
the poor potato cultivation this year. The negative effects of the
so-called 'medicine' have contributed to this crisis."

[Potato late blight (PLB) is caused by the fungus-like organism
_Phytophthora infestans_ and can cause 100 percent crop loss. It is
spread by plant material, wind, and water. For more information on
PLB see links and previous ProMED-mail posts below.

PLB disease management generally relies on fungicide treatments of
seed tubers and crops. The name of the locally produced 'medicine'
above may refer to the fungicide Dithane M45, which can be used to
combat PLB. Dithane M45 has been available for a long time and is
considered very safe and non-toxic for plants, even at high
concentrations (T. Wicks, South Australian Research and Development
Institute, personal communication). Thus it is unlikely to cause
damage to the potato plants, instead the problems described in this
story may be due to contaminations or other errors.

PLB is also currently affecting potatoes in Punjab (ProMED-mail post
no. 20090103.0018), and earlier outbreaks were reported from West
Bengal and other Indian states in previous years.
