Japan officially reports an autochthonous case of dengue fever in a patient (teenaged female) without any overseas travel history. The patient (currently hospitalized) was reported from a healthcare facility in Saitama City [Saitama Prefecture], and following confirmatory laboratory testing procedures at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, the patient was verified as a confirmed case of dengue infection.

As the patient has no overseas travel history and is believed to have acquired the infection domestically, currently Saitama City is conducting epidemiologic investigations jointly with the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) and other local government counterparts.

In addition, regarding this event, MHLW is providing information and feedback to prefectural counterparts and has alerted healthcare facilities.

Dengue fever is a febrile viral illness. The virus is transmitted by mosquitoes, and is found widely throughout the world, such as in Asia, Central and South America, and Africa. The virus is not transmitted person-to-person. In Japan, the mosquito _Aedes albopictus_ (a mosquito species that is mostly active during daylight hours in outdoor environments) is the vector believed to be most likely to transmit the virus.

Domestic transmission of dengue virus was present in Japan during the early 1940s when many soldiers returned from the tropics, but a domestic case had not been confirmed since then. However, in recent years, approximately 200 imported cases (those that have onset after returning to Japan following overseas travel) are reported annually, and transmission from such patients (via mosquitoes) is a possibility.

As the investigation regarding this event is ongoing with Saitama City, updated information will be provided in a timely manner.

Japanese health authorities have reported the 1st locally transmitted case of dengue fever in the country in nearly 70 years.

The ministry said the case occurred in Saitama Prefecture. Local media reports said the patient was a teenage girl who has since recovered.

Government spokesman Yoshihide Suga, in confirming the report, said Wednesday [27 Aug 2014] that the news was not cause for alarm because the illness is not transmitted directly from person to person.

Japan sees dozens of imported cases of dengue fever each year, mostly tourists who catch the illness while traveling in tropical regions. The disease, which is transmitted by mosquito, was common in Japan during World War II but was locally eradicated for decades.

Dengue causes symptoms including fever, severe joint pain and headaches. There is no treatment.

Dengue has been spreading in recent years, with 50 million to 100 million dengue infections a year in more than 100 countries. According to the World Health Organization, before 1970 only 9 countries had experienced dengue epidemics. Japan reported 249 cases last year.

The Ministry of Heath, Labor and Welfare said Thursday [28 Aug 2014] that 2 more domestic cases of dengue fever have been confirmed in Japan.

A man in his 20s from Tokyo and a woman in her 20s from Saitama Prefecture, north of Tokyo, have been confirmed to have contracted the disease, the ministry said.

The news came after the discovery on Wednesday [27 Aug 2014] that a woman in her teens had been infected with the tropical disease, the 1st locally transmitted dengue fever case in Japan in about 70 years.

The 3 go to the same school in Tokyo and have no history of overseas travel. As all of them went to Yoyogi Park in Tokyo's Shibuya Ward recently, they are believed to have been infected by mosquitos.

[The occurrence of 3 cases occurring simultaneously in the same place, after a 70-year absence of dengue virus transmission in Japan, is remarkable. It seems likely that the 3 individuals were infected in the very same spot, and likely at the same time. It would be of interest to receive reports of any additional cases that might occur there and any related mosquito vector field studies that might be carried out, confirming the presence of _Aedes albopictus_.

There was a dengue case in Germany ex Japan that occurred in September 2013, reported in a ProMED-mail post of 9 Jan 2014 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20140109.2162194). This case was reported again recently in Eurosurveillance (Schmidt-Chanasit J, Emmerich P, Tappe D, Gunther S, Schmidt S, Wolff D, Hentschel K, Sagebiel D, Schoneberg I, Stark K, Frank C. Autochthonous dengue virus infection in Japan imported into Germany, September 2013. Euro Surveill. 2014;19(3):pii=20681. Available online: http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20681).

The summary of that report stated, "In September 2013, dengue virus (DENV) infection was diagnosed in a German traveller returning from Japan. DENV-specific IgM and IgG and DENV NS1 antigen were detected in the patient's blood, as were DENV serotype 2-specific antibodies. Public health authorities should be aware that autochthonous transmission of this emerging virus may occur in Japan. Our findings also highlight the importance of taking a full travel history, even from travellers not returning from tropical countries, to assess potential infection risks of patients." This report was sent to ProMED by Roland Hubner. So perhaps the 3 cases above are not the 1st indications of local dengue virus transmission in nearly 70 years after all.
