The small grain harvest has commenced from eastern Pennsylvania to southern
South Dakota. Winter wheat is generally in good to poor condition and ahead
of normal maturity throughout most of the U.S. Spring-planted small grain
crops are ahead of normal maturity throughout much of the area.

Wheat stem rust.
---------------
There have been no further reports of wheat stem rust since late May, when
rust was reported in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and Kinston, North Carolina
soft red winter wheat plots. Stem rust observation maps are now available
on the CDL website (<http://www.ars.usda.gov/Main/docs.htm?docid=9757>).
Wheat leaf rust.
---------------
Wheat leaf rust in the upper Midwest is at high severities on susceptible
winter wheat and is increasing on susceptible spring wheat. In late June,
plots of susceptible winter wheat cultivars such as Jagalene, in
east-central Minnesota and east-central South Dakota had 60 percent rust
severities, while resistant cultivars had only trace levels of infection on
the flag leaves. By late June, spring wheat had leaf rust severities of
trace to 1 percent on lower leaves in southern Minnesota and North Dakota
fields. Susceptible spring wheat cultivars in southern Minnesota plots had
20 percent rust severities with most infections on the lower leaves. This
year leaf rust is widespread, but at lower levels than normal in the upper
Midwest on both spring and winter wheat. Lower amounts of rust inoculum
than in previous years arrived from the winter wheat region because of the
persistent drought-like conditions in the southern plains which reduced
rust infections in the winter wheat. Drier than normal conditions in May
and June in many areas of the northern Great Plains has further slowed rust
development. Some of the spring wheat cultivars currently grown have less
effective resistance to leaf rust than those commonly grown 10-15 years
ago. Many of the wheat fields in the spring wheat region will be treated
with fungicide, which will prevent losses due to leaf rust. More leaf rust
was found this year than last year in Ohio. By mid-June, leaf rust was
severe on the upper leaves of susceptible cultivars throughout the northern
wheat growing areas of Ohio. The 1st report of leaf rust in Ohio was during
the 2nd week in May in south central Ohio, where the rust may have
overwintered. Moisture conditions throughout this area have been conducive
for rust development. As of late June, no wheat leaf rust had been in found
New York.
Wheat stripe rust.
------------------
Wheat stripe rust is widespread in the Pacific Northwest and has stopped
throughout the northern plains wheat-growing area. By the 3rd week in June,
traces of stripe rust were found on a few winter wheat cultivars in east
central South Dakota and east-central Minnesota plots (Fig. 2). Hot weather
has stopped rust production in these plots. The only report of stripe rust
this year in Ohio was in a wheat breeding line. In 2005, stripe rust was
found at a number of locations in Ohio. By mid-June, stripe rust was
widespread in eastern Pacific Northwest fields and plots. On 16 Jun 2006,
30 percent severities were reported on susceptible winter wheat entries and
10 percent on susceptible spring wheat entries in disease monitoring
nurseries at the Pendleton Experiment Station in Oregon. In nurseries near
Walla Walla, Washington stripe rust severities reached 100 percent on
susceptible entries in both winter wheat and spring wheat nurseries. Stripe
rust was found in commercial spring wheat fields in the Palouse area, where
10 percent of the plants were infected with severities less than 5 percent
on lower leaves. The wet and cool conditions the first 3 weeks in June were
conducive for rust production. Cool and wet weather the first half of June
have been favorable to stripe rust development in Montana winter wheat. In
central and east central Montana 15 000 - 20 000 acres of winter wheat have
been sprayed with fungicides. There have been sporadic reports of stripe
rust spreading to spring wheat, but the severity has been low. It has been
dry and warm since the middle of June and stripe rust development has
slowed considerably during the latter part of June. In mid-June, wheat
stripe foci of 60-80 percent severity were observed in winter wheat nursery
plots at Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Infections were noted on lower leaves,
indicating that overwintering may have occurred. Very mild winter
conditions with adequate snow cover occurred in 2005-2006, and spring
temperatures were near normal, which would have been favorable for stripe
rust infection.

[There are 3 main rust diseases of the cereal crop plant wheat (bread
wheat, _Triticum aestivum_ and durum wheat, _Triticum turgidum_), all
caused by species of the fungus _Puccinia_: wheat stem rust (_P. graminis
f.sp. tritici_), wheat leaf rust (_P. triticina_ aka _P. recondita f. sp.
tritici_) and wheat stripe rust (_P. striiformis f. sp. tritici_).
Severe losses due to wheat stem rusts have abated in the USA since the
1960s due to effective resistance breeding. Severe losses are still a
possibility with leaf rust. The USDA Cereal Disease Laboratory in St. Paul,
Minnesota publishes regular reports on cereal rusts in the USA during the
crop season. Each report gives detailed state-by-state information,
including a summary map, all in pdf file format (see link to main article).
Information for rusts other than those that infect wheat is not included in
this ProMED-mail posting, but others are described in the full report.
This report for late June 2006 confirms that rust is present on susceptible
lines and that fungicide treatments are still needed for some commonly
grown lines that do not have robust resistance. Climatic reasons are
presented to explain lower amounts of leaf rust inoculum than in previous
years.
