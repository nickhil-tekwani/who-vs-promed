A homemade beer that killed 75 drinkers at a funeral in Mozambique earlier this year was brewed with contaminated flour, health authorities said today, 4 Nov 2015. ruling out deliberate poisoning.

Hundreds of people drank the beer, with dozens found dead in their homes later in the day and others rushed to a local hospital with diarrhea and severe muscle aches. A total of 232 people were affected, and 75 died in the incident in the village of Chitima in the northwest of Mozambique.

"The victims were poisoned by the homemade beer which had been contaminated by toxic bacteria found in the corn flour used to brew it," Ilesh Jani, director of Mozambique's Health Institute, told reporters.

The woman who brewed the opaque beer and several members of her family were among the dead. Some local media had initially speculated that the beer was laced with crocodile bile, a powerful toxin. But tests conducted in the USA identified _Burkholderia gladioli_, a bacterium found in the flour as the source of the poisoning. Cases of similar poisoning from the same potent bacterium have in the past been reported in Indonesia and China, according to Jani.

[ProMED has previously posted on outbreaks of this toxin illness in China (in Yunnan Province from a fermented corn flour snack) and Indonesia (in Central Java from tempe bongkrek, a fermented soybean cake made with coconut pulp). This current outbreak from beer fermented from corn flour is clearly the largest.

The cause of this cluster of foodborne illness is formally now referred to as _Burkholderia gladioli_ pathovar _cocovenenans_, as discussed in the following article with its abstract:

Jiao Z, Kawamura Y, Mishima N, et al: Need to differentiate lethal toxin-producing strains of _Burkholderia gladioli_, which cause severe food poisoning: description of _B. gladioli_ pathovar _cocovenenans_ and an amended description of _B. gladioli_. Microbiol Immunol. 2003;47: 915-25.

"Abstract:
_Burkholderia cocovenenans_ produces a lethal toxin (Bongkrekic acid) that leads to high fatality in food poisoning cases. However, _B. cocovenenans_ was combined in _Burkholderia gladioli_ in 1999. _B. gladioli_ was originally described as a phytopathogenic bacteria that sometimes causes pneumonia in humans and that acts as an opportunistic pathogen. We thought that it was clinically dangerous to describe these 2 species without considering their pathogenicities. From our data of 16S rRNA sequence analysis, DNA-DNA hybridization, and fatty acid analysis, we could confirm that _B. cocovenenans_ and _B. gladioli_ should be categorized as a single species. However the species really weaved lethal toxin-producing strains with non-lethal strains. To emphasize that _B. gladioli_ contains 2 different pathogens, we describe a new pathovar, _B. gladioli_ pathovar _cocovenenans_, for the lethal toxin-producing strains. We provide characteristics that differentiate this lethal toxin-producing pathovar from other phytopathogenic pathovars within _B. gladioli_, together with an emended description of _B. gladioli_."

An earlier discussion of the toxin can be found below:

Hu WJ, Chen XM, Meng HD, Meng ZH: Fermented corn flour poisoning in rural areas of China. III. Isolation and identification of main toxin produced by causal microorganisms. Biomed Environ Sci. 1989 Mar;2: 65-71.

"Abstract:
Flavotoxin A was isolated from _Pseudomonas cocovenenans_ subsp. culture in semisolid potato-dextrose-agar medium, which was isolated from fermented corn meal that had caused food poisoning outbreaks in China. The isolation, purification, and chemical structure of this toxin were studied. The NMR spectra, the UV spectra, and molar extinction coefficients, and the mass spectra of Flavotoxin A are in good agreement with those reported for bongkrekic acid. Therefore, Flavotoxin A and bongkrekic acid are the same organic chemical compound; the molecular formula is C28H38O7. The oral LD50 of the purified Flavotoxin A in mice was 3.16 mg/kg (1.53-6.15 mg/kg). The existence of bongkrekic acid in toxic fermented corn samples collected during food poisoning outbreaks was also confirmed. It is concluded that bongkrekic acid has played an important role in the outbreaks of fermented corn poisoning."

Fermented foods are used throughout the world and provide numerous benefits particularly to people in developing countries. The foods play an important role in providing food security, enhancing livelihoods and improving the nutrition and social wellbeing of much of the world's population, especially those who are marginalized and vulnerable.

Battcock M and Azam-Ali S are the authors of a treatise concentrated on aspects of fermented food (Fermented fruits and vegetables. A global perspective. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations Bulletin No. 134, Rome, 1998: http://www.fao.org/docrep/x0560e/x0560e06.htm. - Mod.LL
