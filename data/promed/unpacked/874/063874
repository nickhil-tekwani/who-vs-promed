The death toll has climbed to 8 in a legionnaire's disease outbreak in Portugal, which the World Health Organization has called a public [health] emergency, officials announced on Sunday [16 Nov 2014].

The latest victim is the 2nd woman to have died since the 1st case appeared on 7 Nov 2014. Few details were released about her, including when she died.

The Portuguese government has said the outbreak was very likely caused by bacteria found in the refrigeration system of a fertilizer factory in Vila Franca de Xira, about 30 km (20 miles) north of Lisbon.

At least 317 people have been infected since the 1st case was discovered, but on Friday [14 Nov 2014], the head of Portugal's health board, Francisco George, said the risk of new infections had "returned to normal."

The disease is not contagious and cannot be spread directly from person to person but can multiply in water and air conditioning systems, including humidifiers, whirlpools and spas. It is usually caught by breathing in small droplets of contaminated water.

The Portuguese government has called it the 3rd largest outbreak in the history of the disease. Environment minister Jorge Moreira da Silva said the Adubos fertiliser factory was tested to see whether there was negligence in maintenance and whether any "environmental crime" had been committed.

Legionnaire's disease was discovered in the United States in 1976 after a convention of the American Legion, a military veterans' group, at which 29 people died.

[The news report above says that a total of 7 deaths and 317 cases of legionnaires' disease have now been reported in the outbreak in Vila Franca de Xira, a town in the Portugal's Lisbon District. Also, according to the news report above, the source of the outbreak is suspected to be the refrigeration system of a fertilizer factory in Vila Franca de Xira.

Even if this fertilizer factory in Vila Franca de Xira were actually the source for all the cases of legionnaires' disease in this outbreak, and even if this source had been shut down, because legionnaires' disease has an incubation period of up to 2 weeks, it is likely more people who were exposed before an abatement will show symptoms.

Genotyping of patient and environmental isolates has become a helpful tool to establish transmission pathways. The predominance of one genotype of _Legionella_ isolated from patient specimens would suggest transmission from a common source. Because _Legionella_ may be found in environmental samples without linkage to any cases of legionellosis, the actual causative infectious reservoir can be confirmed by matching the genotype of clinical and environmental isolates (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC86783/ and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730281/).
