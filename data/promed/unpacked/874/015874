A riding school is trying to stop the outbreak of a potentially deadly disease after 3 of its horses were taken ill. One of the horses at Shopland Hall Equestrian Centre, in Shopland Hall Road, Rochford, has been officially diagnosed with strangles, a serious respiratory tract infection.

Yard bosses decided to make a public statement to warn horse owners of the dangers of the highly contagious bacterial disease. Their online post has reached the equestrian community across south Essex after being shared on Facebook, with more than 15 000 people reading the statement.

Horses kept in stables at the yard and riding school animals have been kept apart in an attempt to stop the spread of strangles. The post said: "I am sad to have to report we do have 1 confirmed case of strangles at Shopland Hall." 2 other horses have been unwell but are not confirmed as having strangles. Hopefully we have nipped it in the bud as the strangles case has been isolated and livery horses have been separated from riding school horses as has the staff." Centre bosses also posted pictures of workers carrying out an "obsessive clean" of the stables.

Their announcement was shared hundreds of times on Facebook. A centre spokesman added: "I am amazed that over 15 000 people have read this post. Maybe we can stop strangles spreading with a dash of honesty. Thanks to the many who shared it."

Many applauded Shopland Hall's honesty and bravery in making the public statement, believing it may have stopped a strangles epidemic. Kirsty Arnold, chairman at Basildon Equestrian Club, told the Echo: "I think they have dealt with it fantastically, they have been really honest. A lot of people try to hide it. "If everywhere was as honest as Shopland Hall then strangles wouldn't be such an issue. We want to send our well wishes to the horse and the owner."

Horse rider Zoe Cain-Tyler added: "A massive high five for being up front about it. There is so much unnecessary stigma attached to strangles. It happens despite tight controls."
