Report type: immediate notification
Started: 2 Nov 2022
Confirmed: [15 Nov 2022, see affected population description section]
Reported: 21 Nov 2022
Reason for notification: recurrence of a listed disease
Last occurrence: 23 Oct 2022
Causal agent: rabies virus
Serotype: RABV
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

Outbreak location: Melilla
Started: 2 Nov 2022
Ended: 14 Nov 2022
Epidemiological unit: other
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Dogs / - / 1 / 1 / - / - / -

Affected population: the dog was a female pit bull mongrel, with a white and white-tan coat, from Morocco, which was captured on [3 Nov 2022]. At the time of capture, she did not present compatible clinical symptoms but subsequently presented vocalizations, absent gaze, and aphonia. The brain was extracted on [11 Nov 2022] and sent to the National Reference Laboratory, which on [15 Nov 2022] confirmed the positive result for rabies via PCR.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreaks(s): introduction of new live animals
Epidemiological comments: an animal from Morocco that, after capture, developed symptoms compatible with rabies.

Control measures at event level
Domestic and wild control measures applied: surveillance within the restricted zone
Control measures different from event level: traceability; quarantine; official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Carlos III Institute of Health (national laboratory) / dog / real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) / [15 Nov 2022] / positive

[Rabies is endemic in Morocco.

As has been mentioned before, Spain (peninsular territory and islands) has been free of terrestrial rabies since 1978, except for the case of rabies imported from Morocco declared in June 2013. The vaccination campaigns carried out in dogs gave excellent results, eradicating the disease in the entire national territory. Only in the Autonomous Cities of Ceuta and Melilla are there sporadically imported cases of rabies in dogs and some horses (https://www.mapa.gob.es/es/ganaderia/temas/sanidad-animal-higiene-ganadera/sanidad-animal/enfermedades/rabia/Rabia.aspx; in Spanish).

"From a global public health perspective, the dog should be considered a main target for rabies elimination as this principal reservoir is responsible for the overwhelming majority of reported animal and human rabies cases. It has been demonstrated that the disease can be successfully controlled in certain wild carnivores, such as red foxes, raccoon dogs, and coyotes. Apart from dogs, other companion animals (such as cats and ferrets) and livestock pose a risk for human exposure and would benefit from inclusion in any national vaccination programme. Additionally, vaccination of livestock in rabies endemic areas is recommended as it secures livelihoods in many parts of the world.

"In countries where the disease is endemic, measures are implemented to address and reduce the risk of infection in susceptible populations (wildlife, stray and domestic animals) in order to create a buffer between the animal disease reservoir and humans.

"A rabies control programme should consider:
- Socio-cultural framework, including public awareness, the promotion of responsible pet ownership, and animal welfare.
- Technical framework, including vaccination programmes for both domestic and wildlife animals, improving laboratory confirmed disease surveillance and reporting, appropriate diagnostic capability, dog population management, and animal movement control."
