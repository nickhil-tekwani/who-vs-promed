Update on the dengue hemorrhagic fever outbreak in Ecuador
----------------------------------------------------------
Ten new cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) have been confirmed by the
Tropical Medicine Sub-Secretariat. These cases bring the national total to
33. The majority (26) are from the province of Guayas with the remaining
from the provinces of Los Rios (2), El Oro (3), Bolivar (1), and Pichincha
(1). The latter case is in the western part of the province in Santo
Domingo. Most of the cases in the province of Guayas are in suburbs of
Guayaquil.
In Ecuador there are 6696 patients with classical dengue fever, with 725
having a confirmed diagnosis. It is estimated that there are 2.5 million
persons sensitized to dengue [virus and therefore at risk of presenting
with the hemorrhagic form of dengue fever. The authorities estimate that
one in 100 if exposed will develop hemorrhagic dengue.
Three thousand workers will survey households to identify those where the
vector is present. Cuban experts are expected to arrive to assist in the
technical aspects of the problem. Instructions have been given to
provincial hospitals for the evacuation of less seriously ill patients in
order to make room for any possible increase of severely ill individuals.
