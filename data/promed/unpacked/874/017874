Charlie's changes have, again, improved the report a great deal and are
much appreciated. There are no changes in the meaning, except for the
introduction of [bat in the first sentence, last paragraph of the original
message [see the (02) posting cited above - Mod.ES. This is the first
rabies case (any species) in Patagonia ever recognized.
It is possible that rabies would spill over from _Desmodus rotundus_ to
bats of other species with which they cohabit. We've found frugivorous
bats _Artibeus literatus_ , from Argentina and Brazil, infected with _D.
rotundus_ "antigenic variants but [have not found _Tadarida brasiliensis_
infected, so far (paper in press, J Vet Med B).
Vampire bats are a problem in northern Argentina (approx. 1000 miles from
El Bolson), mostly for cattle. However, a child from Salta died of rabies
transmitted by vampire bats, in the 1960s. The case originally was
clinically diagnosed as polio and, after lab confirmation of rabies, her
family reported that two brothers had died before, with the same symptoms.
Lately, the number of human cases transmitted from vampire bats has
increased in Brazil, Peru, Mexico, etc. (Rabies surveillance for the
Americas, PAHO/WHO, VOL 25-27).
