Doctors in Kitgum are investigating a report of suspected outbreak of guinea worm disease (GWD) [dracunculiasis] in the district 10 years after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Uganda a guinea worm-free country.

The suspected case was reported last week [week ending 22 Sep 2013] in Akara Labot-lwonga village, Pajong parish in Mucwini Sub County where a 72-year-old woman exhibited prospective signs and symptoms of the disease also called dracunculiasis.

The case-patient, who first suffered from the parasitic disease 15 years ago explained that she develops constant fever, swelling, and pain on her left foot -- very similar to signs she once experienced.

"Our water sources are contaminated and I suspect the blisters on my foot may turn out to be guinea worm. This is also how I developed the earlier infection," said the patient.

GWD is an infection that affects poor communities in remote parts of Africa who drink water contaminated by water fleas that host the dracunculus larva.

[According to the WHO, guinea worm is transmitted exclusively by drinking stagnant water contaminated with tiny water fleas that carry infective guinea worm larvae. Humans are the only known reservoirs for the disease. Following infection, a painful blister forms [usually on the lower leg] followed by the emergence of one or more worms from the blister, about one year after the infection (http://www.who.int/dracunculiasis/en/).

Guinea worm [dracunculiasis] is one of the diseases targeted for eradication globally through interventions like ensuring access to safe drinking-water supplies, filtration of drinking water to prevent infection, intense surveillance and control to detect every case within 24 hours of the emergence of the worm(s), treatment of ponds with the larvicide temephos that kills the water fleas, and promoting health education and behaviour change (http://www.who.int/dracunculiasis/en/).

Currently, the disease is endemic in 4 counties including South Sudan [that shares a border with Kitgum district, Uganda], Ethiopia, Mali and Chad, from where 90 cases have been reported since January 2013, representing a decline of 72 percent from the cases reported during the corresponding period of 2012. A guinea worm case was recently confirmed in South Darfur, Sudan, at the border with Western Bahr el Ghazal, Sudan, indicating ongoing transmission in the region. (http://www.who.int/dracunculiasis/dracunculiasis_sudan_post_2011_situation/en/index.html).

Additional information from epidemiological and laboratory investigations into the suspect guinea worm case reported in Kitgum will be appreciated.

Uganda was certified Guinea worm free in 2009.

It is important to stress that the patient is only suspected of having guinea worm, and that the diagnosis has not been confirmed. Also, as pointed out, Kitgum borders South Sudan, where guinea worm is still found, and it is important to know whether there is a travel history to South Sudan in this case.

If the patient has guinea worm and was reinfected in Uganda, it shows that the infection has not been eradicated, and surveillance for other cases should commence. - Mod.EP]
