In the last 48 hours from Tuesday [13 Sep 2016], 9 children [have] died of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) at BRD Medical College [Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh]. The death toll has reached 254 from January this year [2016]. Over 10 000 children have died of encephalitis in the last 4 decades at the medical college alone. Many deaths occur in private nursing homes which go unrecorded.

Children are dying of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) which is caused by unhygienic conditions and drinking contaminated water. Japanese encephalitis [JE], which is caused by mosquito bite, has come under control with the vaccination programme as the death due to JE has come down to 4 per cent [of all encephalitis cases? - Mod.TY].

Open defecation and drinking contaminated water are the main cause behind spread of AES. "We have been demanding a national programme for the eradication of the disease on the lines of polio and chickenpox. Deaths due to encephalitis is much low[er] in comparison to dengue," said chief campaigner of National Encephalitis Eradication movement, RN Singh.

[The number of deaths from encephalitis in the BRD Medical College Hospital has risen from 224 on 4 Sep 2016 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20160905.4467223) to 254 as reported above. Cases of encephalitis are common in Uttar Pradesh state at this time of the year. Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus is endemic in northeastern India and more cases can be expected over the remainder of the transmission season. The Gorakhpur district of Uttar Pradesh state has been an active focus of JE cases annually. The above report does not indicate if the new cases had been tested for JE or had been vaccinated for it previously.

Although JE virus is likely involved in a minority of these cases, the above report does not indicate the etiological agent responsible for these AES cases. The encephalitis picture in north eastern India is complicated. The JE virus etiology of some previously reported encephalitis cases has been confirmed by laboratory tests. However, many cases go undiagnosed or JE virus infection is ruled out and other etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, lychee consumption, sun stroke, and enterovirus infection have been proposed. The above report indicates that there is an association of these AES cases and contiminated water, suggesting an enterovirus etiology. The above report does not indicate if there has been laboratory testing to confirm that.
