[As of 30 Jun 2019, there have been a total of 2449 cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by Saudi Arabia since 2012, including 845 deaths. The above report summarizes the information available on these cases: 7 of the 8 cases were non-healthcare personnel and 1 case was a secondary case in a healthcare worker. I've put the Saudi MOH information on outcomes in square brackets next to each case. There appears to be a discrepancy in outcome reports on cases Nos. 4 and 5. As both outcomes were reported on 26 Jun 2019 and cases were similar in ages (70 vs 71 years old), it's understandable how there may have been a transcription error. Clarification of these discrepancies would be greatly appreciated.

Impression: MERS-CoV is still circulating in Saudi Arabia, with sporadic cases reported on a fairly regular basis (6-8 cases per month in the absence of nosocomial transmission. Other impression: we still don't fully understand why there is a preponderance of cases being reported from Saudi Arabia with the rare sporadic case reported from other areas in the region.

Of note, the media has had numerous articles of countries warning their Hajis to look out for MERS-CoV and avoid contact with camels. A prudent alert, but to date there have not been any cases of MERS-CoV infection reported in returning Hajis. The Saudi government has established health units specifically for Hajis and has banned camels from the active areas where Hajis reside and travel, prudent public health measures. - Mod.MPP]
