Arkansas: stripe rust alert
---------------------------
At least 2 new races of the stripe rust fungus appear to be in
Arkansas and are causing severe stripe rust on several varieties that
were resistant in previous years. One widespread race overcomes the
resistance in Armor Renegade, but this race appears to be different
from the race that overcomes the resistance in 26R87.

This conclusion is based on observations in demo plots. In these
plots, Renegade has severe stripe rust throughout the entire 1.2 acre
[0.5 ha] strip, but 26R87 is clean except for one big hot spot of
stripe rust that can be seen from the road. This hot spot was about 6
m [20 ft] in diameter last week [week of 19 Apr 2010] and appeared to
be spreading quickly. Weather for the next few days will be favorable
for stripe rust, and stripe rust likely will continue to spread
quickly in fields of susceptible varieties.

[Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereals is caused by the
fungus _Puccinia striiformis_ var. _striiformis_. It causes yellow
leaf stripes and stunting of plants with yield losses of 40 to 100
percent. The disease affects wheat, some barley varieties, triticale,
and a number of wild grasses. Spores are wind dispersed in several
cycles during the cropping season, and the fungus survives on living
host plants generating a "green bridge" between seasons. Disease
management includes the use of resistant varieties, fungicide
applications, and control of volunteer crops.

New stripe rust strains with increased virulence have been reported
in recent years from Europe, North America, Australia, and India and
are also suspected to emerge in China. Monitoring programmes are
important to recognise these emerging new strains and it can be
expected that they will differ in national or regional significance,
depending on the susceptibility of preferred cereal varieties.

In the USA, currently at least one new strain is also being reported
from Texas (ProMED-mail post 20100504.1443), and stripe rust problems
were predicted for Arkansas in 2010 because of large amounts of
inoculum produced in Louisiana and Texas (ProMED-mail post 20100331.1017).
