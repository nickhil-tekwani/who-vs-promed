Five people were hospitalized at Emek Medical Center in Afula and another 4 were treated and discharged on Monday [14 May 2014] after being infected with brucellosis bacteria from drinking milk that had not been pasteurized or meat from unvaccinated animals. The patients were treated with antibiotics and given supportive care.

Dr. Bibiana Hazan, who heads the hospital's infectious diseases unit, said the disease is transmitted to people by sheep, cows, and goats that have not been immunized against it.

[_Brucella abortus_ has been eradicated in Israel since the early 1980s; since then, _Brucella melitensis_ has been the only identified causative agent of brucellosis in Israel. The disease is regarded endemic, similarly to all countries in the Middle East and in many Mediterranean countries. It causes abortions in sheep and goat flocks and Malta Fever, a serious zoonosis, in humans. According to Israel's annual OIE report for 2012, 14 outbreaks were reported in sheep and goat flocks. The number of human cases was, reportedly, 183 (2.6046 per 100 000 population). Vaccination with _B. melitensis_ REV1 vaccine was applied in 144 852 sheep and 21 528 goats.

The 2013 figures are the following: 11 outbreaks in sheep and goats; 336 human cases (4.7822 per 100 000); vaccinations: sheep 148 601, goats 21 838, on the public health front, a concerning change (83 percent increase).

The majority of the human brucellosis cases in Israel are caused by the ingestion of unpasteurized dairy products produced from family-owned sheep and/or goat flocks. Exposure to infected farm animals (occupational infection) is another common cause of infection. Most of the human cases are encountered in southern Israel. _B. melitensis_ may occasionally infect cattle; in contrast to _B. abortus_, which causes abortions in cattle, _B. melitensis_ is not abortifacient in cattle but will infect the udders followed by massive discharge of the highly pathogenic bacteria in the milk.

More information on the current event in the north is anticipated. Is this a cluster and from one or several locations? Is there a common source of infection (e.g. a batch of a sheep-goat dairy product)? Or, have the (rural?) patients been directly exposed to infected animals?

For the number of _Brucella melitensis_ outbreaks in Israel between 1990-2012, see page 47 (sheep/goats) and 48 (cattle) at http://www.moag.gov.il/agri/files/doh_shnati_2012.pdf.
