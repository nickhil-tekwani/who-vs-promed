- Telangana (Hyderabad). 25 Jul 2017. All 4 dengue serotypes are present this year [2017]. A total of 15 samples found to be co-infected. In an earlier study done in New Delhi, such multiple dengue serotype infections were reported in only 19 per cent of cases. All 4 dengue serotypes were detected in almost equal number in blood samples, unlike in an earlier study conducted in New Delhi wherein one serotype was found to be dominating. This has been indicated as a possible reason for the high prevalence of infection due to more than one dengue serotype. Another finding of concern is that DEN-4 strain, resembling the one detected in Pune in 2009, was detected in as many as 11 samples. DEN-4 is associated with unusual symptoms like respiratory distress, pleural effusion, and elevated levels of liver enzymes. Also, detection of a DEN-1 strain found closely related to a strain from Thailand detected in 1980 that causes high severity infection has been reported. Dr Musturi Venkataramana, assistant professor of biotechnology of UoH, who led the study, said, "When a person is infected with more than one serotype of dengue, it may lead to dengue haemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome which can cause severe health problems, and even death. Finding 45 per cent patients with such infections is worrisome."

Abstract. Since April 2017, a dengue fever outbreak has been ongoing in Côte d'Ivoire. We diagnosed dengue fever (type 2 virus) in a traveler returning to Japan from Côte d'Ivoire. Phylogenetic analysis revealed strain homology with the Burkina Faso 2016 strain. This case may serve as an alert to possible disease spread outside Africa.

- Viral persistence, organ transplant-related transmission

There is now a concern that the dengue virus can reside in the body even after one has recovered and the virus is non-detectable in the blood, said a well-known dengue scientist. This came about after 2 kidney recipients in Taiwan were diagnosed with dengue 2 days after receiving a kidney each from the same donor, said National Cheng Kung University microbiology and immunology professor Dr Oscar Perng Guey-chuen. "This indicates a potential risk," the Taiwan-based scientist said, adding that no dengue virus was detected in the donor's blood.

He said the donor contracted dengue in 2015 and in mid-2016, he died in an accident. His family donated his corneas, liver, heart, and kidneys. Both patients had the same strain of the dengue virus the donor had in 2015 and one of the recipients died of dengue haemorrhagic fever, he said.

Asked where the virus could be hiding since it could not be detected in the blood, he said it was a question scientists are trying to answer. Interestingly, those who received the donor's corneas, liver, and heart did not develop dengue, Dr Perng said on the sidelines of the National Dengue And Arboviruses Infection Conference 2017 yesterday [12 Aug 2017]. He said although there was not enough evidence to show the virus came from the donor as the kidneys were not tested for dengue before the transplant, the same virus was found in the patients' bodies after that.

Dr Perng said his team had studied mice for dengue virus in the blood testes, kidney, liver, spleen and brain, and found the virus present in the kidneys and brain. "We believe the virus probably resided in the kidneys and was not cleared by the body," he said, adding that the virus could have been activated after transplant. He said this raised concerns about asymptomatic people who are dengue carriers.

Health Ministry deputy director, general Datuk Dr S Jeyaindran said patients with severe dengue would have better recovery if they were given colloids, a more concentrated fluid, at the early stage in fluid management for dengue patients. Dr Jeyaindran, who was representing Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr S Subramaniam, said colloids may be introduced at an earlier stage, instead of saline because it has not been successful in treating patients with severe dengue. He said more studies will be conducted to find out at which stage the colloids should be given.

- Air travel related spread of dengue
Date: Thu 3 Aug 2017
Source: Medical Xpress [edited]
https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-08-air-responsible-dengue-asia.html


While the incidences of many other infectious diseases have declined over the past decade, the number of cases and outbreaks of dengue virus have continued to increase. The spread of dengue to new areas is likely due in large part to trends in air travel, researchers now report in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases.

Dengue virus affects as estimated 390 million people around the globe each year, and can cause symptoms ranging from a mild fever and headache to severe low blood pressure. The virus has mostly caused disease in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, but a 2014 outbreak in Japan broke that pattern. Overall, the geographic area affected by dengue has been growing in recent years.

In the new work, Huaiyu Tian and Bing Xu, both of Beijing Normal University, China, together with colleagues from the University of Oxford and elsewhere analyzed the spread of dengue viruses in Asia from 1956 to 2015. They used 2202 genetic sequences of dengue viruses, collected in 20 countries or regions of Asia over the 59 years, to determine how different strains were related. They also investigated trends in air travel, maritime mobility, migration, and socio-economics to determine what factors impact the spread of dengue.

The spread of 3 different dengue virus serotypes, DENV-1, -2, and -3, is associated with air traffic more so than any other factors, the data revealed. Air traffic hubs such as Thailand and India, the researchers found, help seed dengue epidemics, while China, Cambodia, Indonesia, and Singapore help diffuse the virus to other Asian countries.

"Future trends in global mobility could potentially accelerate the appearance and diffusion of DENV worldwide," the researchers say. "Prevention and control of dengue epidemics requires a better understanding of its mode of geographic dissemination, especially for countries in the tropics."

https://www.nyoooz.com/news/delhi/902768/drop-in-vision-traced-to-inflammation-caused-by-dengue-fever-say-doctors/


In a rare symptom of dengue, a 20 year old in the capital developed "ophthalmic complications" due to which she complained of a "drop in vision". Typical symptoms of dengue range from sore throat, cough, joint pain, and rashes. Sir Gangaram Hospital reported the rare case, where the woman, who went to the eye OPD [outpatient department], complained of "sudden blurring of vision in the left eye," as reported by IE [Indian Express].

According to the newspaper, doctors eventually discovered that the drop in vision was due to "inflammation of blood vessels in the retina", as a result of dengue fever. The woman had earlier tested positive for the vectorborne disease. "The patient tested positive for dengue and had fever for the past 8 days. She did not have any rashes on her body, or any other systemic manifestation."
