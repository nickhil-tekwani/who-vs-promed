The occasional spell of rain in the city over the past few days has led to the number of vector borne diseases, especially chikungunya [fever], going up in the city, especially in outlying areas like Ambattur.

Chikungunya is a viral disease transmitted to humans through infected mosquitoes. While _Aedes aegypti_ or the yellow fever mosquito, which bites during the day, is the primary transmission agent, the _Aedes albopictus_ is a carrier [also]. The symptoms, consultant general physician Dr Srikumaran says, include severe and persistent joint pain, body rash, headache and fever. "Initial symptoms are similar to dengue fever. It is usually not life-threatening, but the joint pain can last many months in certain cases," he said. Stagnant water around human habitations is the main cause of increased aedes populations. "Unlike most mosquitoes that breed and prosper outside from dusk to dawn, chikungunya virus is spread by mosquitoes active during the day, which makes it difficult to use the same chemical mosquito control measures," he said. [Elimination of water catchments that serve as breeding sites, or their treatment with Abate, is a more effective approach to vector control than environmental application of insecticides. Mod.TY]

The chikungunya virus was responsible for a major epidemic in the state in 2006. Hundreds of cases were reported that year, for the 1st time after several decades, mostly from the southern districts. Since then, while cases have been reported sporadically in Chennai, more than 40 residents of Korattur in Ambattur zone have become victims of chikungunya [virus infections]. Several middle aged women have been rendered immobile due to severe pain in their joints.

"The corporation authorities never give attention to sanitation in our area. While we battle overflowing garbage bins that never get cleaned everyday, after every spell of rain, water stagnates on streets leading to mosquito breeding," said Sampath Kumar, a resident of Korattur.

Those with weak immune systems, such as the elderly, are more likely to suffer from the virus' side effects than those who are healthier, said Directorate of Public Health joint director Dr S Balasubramaniam. "People infected with chikungunya [virus] will often have high fever during the acute period, but the residual effect which is characterized by severe joint pain is the problem. It can sometimes last up to 6 months," he said. It is important to keep the surroundings clean and get rid of plastic waste around the house that may end up being a source of mosquito breeding after a spell of rain.

Korattur residents claim the corporation has not taken up vector control activities. "We have conducted an independent analysis and found the situation is not alarming. After most rain, it is normal for a few cases of fever to get reported," said deputy commissioner [of health] T Anand.

As many as 40 residents of Merpanaikadu, an interior village on the border of Pudukottai and Thanjavur districts, have shown symptoms of chikungunya [virus infection] over the past few days. Special health teams from the primary health centres in Aranthangi block, including Nagudi, camped in the village and provided treatment. "The situation is under control; however, a health team has been deployed in the village to keep a close watch," an official source said.

[Chikungunya virus transmission has been very active in Tamil Nadu this month (September 2014). There have been 3 localities affected in the state.

Chikungunya virus is endemic in India. There were scattered outbreaks of chikungunya virus infections in several localities around India last year (2013). A report last year was the 1st one of an outbreak in Tamil Nadu state that has come to ProMED's attention. Now, we have the 3rd and 4th outbreaks reported above. It is not clear whether the diagnoses of chikungunya virus infection are based solely on clinical grounds or whether some or all cases are laboratory diagnosed as well. Cleaning or eliminating water containers is a prudent way to affect vector mosquito control. One hopes that the intensive cleanup campaign being launched successfully reduces the numbers of vector mosquitoes and transmission rates.
