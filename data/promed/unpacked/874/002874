New Mexico's 3rd case of hantavirus infection for 2006 has been confirmed in a
Taos County woman. The woman, whose name was not released, was hospitalized on
Mon [13 Mar 2006] at the University of New Mexico Hospital in Albuquerque. She
has been diagnosed with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), the state
Department of Health said.
Health officials were investigating to determine where the woman may have been
exposed to the virus. The disease is transmitted through particles of dried
urine, droppings or saliva of infected rodents, particularly deer mice
(_Peromyscus maniculatus_). "Rodents are becoming more active with the warmer
weather and people are more likely to come into contact with them and their
droppings," said Paul Ettestad, state public health veterinarian at the
department. "It is very important for everyone to take precautions, especially
as you are opening up sheds and cabins that have been closed during the
winter."
Earlier cases in 2006 included a woman from McKinley County, who has since
recovered, and a Taos man who died from the virus. New Mexico had one case
reported during 2005, in a Los Alamos County man. In 2004, New Mexico had 4
cases, one each in McKinley, Bernalillo, Sandoval and Santa Fe counties. The
McKinley County case that year was fatal.
There is no specific treatment, but health officials said the chances for
recovery are better if medical attention is sought early. Early symptoms of
HPS include fever and muscle aches, possibly with chills, headache, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and a cough. The symptoms develop within 1-
6 weeks after exposure.
The disease was first recognized in 1993 in the Four Corners area where New
Mexico, Arizona, Colorado and Utah meet. Since then, the disease has been
confirmed throughout the country.
