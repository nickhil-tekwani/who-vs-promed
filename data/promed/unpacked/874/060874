Whooping cough cases on upswing
-------------------------------
There's been a significant rise in the number of cases of whooping cough in
the Chicago area in 2004, public health administrators said on 20 Sep 2004,
urging people to use precautions to help stem the spread of the contagious
disease. The outbreak has been concentrated in children 10 to 15 years old,
ages when immunity from the childhood vaccine wanes. While Chicago has
confirmed an increase in whooping cough cases in 2004 compared with
previous years, the biggest jump in numbers appears to be happening in
suburban Cook and the collar [surrounding - Mod.LL] counties. McHenry
County, for example, averages about 8 cases annually. In 2004, it's already
up to 143.
Health officials couldn't explain what's driving the increase. "Part of it
may be increased surveillance," said Dr Julie Morita, medical director of
the Chicago Department of Public Health's immunization program.
Also known as pertussis, whooping cough is a bacterial infection that
spread easily through coughing or sneezing. It's called whooping cough
because those who get it -- especially children -- sometimes make a
"whooping" sound when inhaling. The first symptoms usually appear about a
week after someone is exposed. They can mimic the symptoms of a cold: runny
nose, sneezing, a low fever and a mild cough. Whooping cough symptoms can
progress, though, to severe coughing fits, particularly at night, and
coughing attacks are sometimes followed by vomiting.
The potentially fatal disease tends to be most serious in infants and
people who have compromised immune systems. The last whooping cough death
in Illinois was that of a 2 month old baby in 2001.
Each child should get the pertussis vaccine at 2, 4, 6, and 15 months,
followed by a booster between ages 4 and 6 years, experts say. The vaccine
isn't recommended for anyone over 7, but a booster shot for older people is
in development and could be available in a year, said Dr Eric Whitaker,
director of the Illinois Department of Public Health.
He urged parents to get their children vaccinated and to practice "plain
old good hygiene," including frequent handwashing and covering your mouth
and nose while coughing or sneezing. People exposed to someone with
pertussis should see a doctor and begin antibiotic treatment immediately.

Whooping cough on the rise in New York
--------------------------------------
After several years under the public health radar, whooping cough is making
a comeback in New York. The number of New Yorkers affected by the highly
contagious respiratory illness passed the 1000 mark for the 2nd straight
year, prompting health officials to step up efforts to stave off the disease.
Earlier in 2004, the state Health Department posted a bulletin to community
health departments and health care providers about the recent trend. A
similar alert was sent in Jun 2004 to directors and nurses at summer camps,
where whooping cough outbreaks are not uncommon since children live
together in tight quarters and often have direct contact with one another,
making the disease easier to spread.
Now with the fall school year underway, the focus is shifting to school
nurses and teachers to be on the alert. New York is among 7 states that
currently do not require school-age children to be vaccinated against
whooping cough, although most received the shot as infants as part of a
combination vaccine. Starting in 2005, babies born after 1 Jan would be
required to be vaccinated against whooping cough before they enter school
or day care, under a new law.
"We are taking some unusual and strong measures here to try to deal with
this problem," said Dr Gus Birkhead, the director of the Center for
Community Health at the state Health Department. So far in 2004, there were
1448 confirmed cases of whooping cough, up from 388 in 2000. The average is
300 cases annually.
Health experts say a number of factors may be responsible for the spike in
whooping cough cases in recent years, a trend that is mirrored nationwide,
although they have been unable to pinpoint an exact cause. In 2003, 229
people, in the newborn to age 14 category, were hospitalized with
pertussis. Hospitalization data for 2004 were incomplete.
"Public health officials are somewhat exasperated by not being able to get
this quickly under control," said Dr Lloyd Novick, the commissioner of the
Onondaga County Health Department in central New York, whose county is
considered a whooping cough hotspot. Onondaga County, which includes the
city of Syracuse, normally has 10 cases of pertussis annually. So far this
year, the county is leading the state with the highest number of cases at
128, according to state Health Department figures.
Historically, the incidence of whooping cough has fluctuated, peaking every
3 to 5 years, and health officials say it's possible that the past 2 years
are part of the natural peak cycle. Health officials also point out there's
increased awareness in the medical community and doctors now have more
advanced technology to detect the disease than in previous years.
The federal government is debating whether it should allow booster shots
against the cough, since protection begins to drop 5 to 10 years after the
last shot.

Whooping cough is cyclical in Kansas
------------------------------------
The upsurge in whooping cough or pertussis cases in Kansas in 2004,
particularly in the northeast part of the state, may be cyclical, said
Sharon Watson, spokeswoman for the Kansas Department of Health and Environment.
The department said that, from May through Sep 2004, there were 31
confirmed cases reported in the state, compared with an average of 9 cases
in the previous 3 years for the same months.
In Johnson County, there have been 8 confirmed cases since 1 May 2004. In
2003, 10 cases total were reported, said Nancy Tausz, director of disease
containment for the county health department. No cases have been reported
in the Shawnee Mission School District, according to Debbie Sokoloff,
health services and safety resource specialist. "I do not know of any
cases," she said Wed, 22 Sep 2004. Loralee Baker, director of community
relations for the Olathe School District, said the district had reported 1
suspected case of whooping cough to the Johnson County Health Department
but that it had not been confirmed.
"It seems to go in cycles," Watson said. "In 1999, we had an upsurge in
cases with a total of 49. Children either don't have the vaccinations at
all or haven't completed them. This leads to some adults getting pertussis
from children." More than half of the 31 (Kansas) cases involved children
under age 5, Watson said. "In the cases reported since May 2004, a number
of children were not vaccinated or had not completed the vaccinations they
needed to be protected."
A majority of the Kansas cases so far in 2004 have been reported by 6 north
east Kansas counties, including Douglas, Franklin, Leavenworth, Johnson,
Miami and Wyandotte, according to Watson. KDHE hopes that, by reporting the
increasing incidence of the disease this year, parents will be encouraged
to check their children's records and complete their vaccinations if they
have not already done so.

[Even in developed countries such as the USA, pertussis clusters continue
to occur. The demographics of the cases in such clusters are nonvaccination
of children, incomplete vaccination of children, primary vaccine failure,
waning immunity in adolescence and adults, improved reporting of cases, or,
most likely, a combination of factors. The change in DTP vaccine (which
contained killed, whole-cell pertussis organisms and was quite reactogenic)
to DTaP (which contains several toxoids of _Bordetella pertussis_) has
decreased the reactogenicity but does not appear to greatly increase
immunogenicity. In addition to a higher percentage of infants receiving a
full primary series of vaccination against pertussis, the addition of aP to
the Td booster (which should be given to adults every decade) can assist in
diminishing cases. Unlike the whole-cell product, acellular pertussis
vaccine is well-tolerated in adults. - Mod.LL]
