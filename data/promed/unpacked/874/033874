The case of a young man who contracted Anthrax is the first to be notified
in Queensland in more than 50 years. Health Minister Wendy Edmond told
state parliament it was extremely rare for humans to be infected by
cutaneous anthrax.
Queensland Health had assessed no risk to the public because it could not
be transmitted between humans. Nor was there any risk to livestock, she said.
A young labourer was admitted to Brisbane's Princess Alexandra Hospital on
July 18 with a diagnosis of cellulitis. Cutaneous anthrax was diagnosed 10
days later, Ms Edmond said, and is doing well. However, Ms Edmond said the
patient had not been exposed to animals, and Queensland Health was
investigating the source of the infection.
Possible sources, such as exposure to cotton bales, fertiliser, playing
rugby football or in a home environment were being investigated.

Jackie Harper at Princess Alexandra Hospital rang a couple of times re
identification of the organism, said basically what you have posted.
Patient first presented with small abscess on his backside. No recent farm
contact. Is a young (18 according to a news report) fork-lift driver and
had been recently shifting fertiliser and hessian bales of cotton.
Queensland Health has been doing the epidemiology, apparently no source
identified so far. Queensland DPI's emergency response veterinarian, Ian
Douglas (douglasi@dpi.qld.gov.au), has been liaising with the Health
Department. I couldn't get him on the phone just now, but heard him on the
radio this morning saying that the source has not been determined.
We have not seen any cases of anthrax in animals in Queensland since the
1993 case near Rockhampton.
