City medical officer of health Dr. Brent Friesen confirmed that three out
of seven cattle that died June 25 from anthrax in the Caroline area were
shipped to a Calgary rendering plant before anyone realized they were
infected with the disease. Caroline is 150 km northwest of Calgary. Six
workers who skinned the carcasses at Alberta Processing Co. in southeast
Calgary were told about possible symptoms and given a hotline to contact if
necessary. After the infection was discovered, the other dead cattle were
disposed of at the ranch.
Six workers in Lethbridge involved in handling of the skins and a further
six or so people at the ranch were also contacted and given details of
symptoms.
Friesen said officials also examined the truck used to ship the hides to
Lethbridge and were satisfied it had been adequately disinfected.
"No cases of human illness were identified," said Friesen, who added he was
pleased with the way the public health concerns were handled.
Friesen said the workers' protective clothing prevented their infection
from anthrax. The clothing was kept on site and laundered there. "There was
no risk of these workers taking the clothing home and exposing their
families and friends," he said. But, he added, "If anyone does develop
anthrax, it does respond very effectively to antibiotics."
One of the six workers injured himself slightly while handling one of the
carcasses and was treated with antibiotics as a precaution. But no one else
needed any treatment, said Friesen.
Geoff Smolkin, manager of Alberta Processing, said the company was
inspected by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency after the incident. It was
given a clean bill of health and its processing methods declared
satisfactory in killing the disease. Carcasses there are rendered into meat
and bone meal for livestock feed and for tallow. They are not used for
human consumption.
Since the first outbreak, there have been two further outbreaks involving a
bull that died of anthrax recently in the Caroline area and 13 cattle on a
neighbouring farm that died of the disease July 8.
Friesen said everyone who came into contact with those animals has been
contacted but none was infected.

[This report confirms something I have suspected for some time that Western
Canadian cases of livestock anthrax might get recycled when the processors
are unaware of the cause of death. One of the Canadian strains kills cattle
without any extravasation of blood ... the textbook "red flag" on anthrax
as a cause of sudden death in cattle. It can be but in some regions it is
rarely seen. - MHJ
