Two cases of infection with _Bacillus anthracis_, Romania, October
2011. R. Popescu et al Eurosurveillance, Volume 16, Issue 45, 10 Nov
2011

Abstract
A cluster of 2 confirmed cases of anthrax were reported in October
2011 from a small village with a population of 3400 people, in
southeastern Romania. One was a fatal case of cutaneous and anthrax
meningoencephalitis, while the other had cutaneous anthrax. Both cases
had been exposed to one _Bacillus anthracis_-infected cow via
consumption of its meat or being involved in its slaughter.

Two cases of anthrax were reported to the National Centre for
Communicable Diseases Surveillance and Control on 7 and 8 Oct 2011,
respectively by a local public health authority in southeastern
Romania.

Case description
Case 1
On 7 Oct 2011, a person in their 20s was admitted to a local hospital
with fever (40 C), chills, malaise, pustular lesions on both forearms
(symptom onset on 6 Oct 2011), blood pressure 65/40 mmHg and
respiratory arrest (symptom onset on 7 Oct 2011). After that, the
patient developed meningitis symptoms and died on 9 Oct 2011. During
the hospital stay, the patient was mechanically ventilated and
received dopamine, penicillin and ciprofloxacin intravenously. The
cause of death was reported as cardiovascular and respiratory failure
and septic shock due to disseminated infection with _B. anthracis_,
confirmed by presence of the bacterium on the skin and in the bloody
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

Case 2
Following the identification of Case 1, during the epidemiological
investigations conducted by the local public health department, a 2nd
person in their 20s was identified from the same village and
subsequently confirmed as a case of cutaneous anthrax. The onset of
symptoms in this case was 3 Oct 2011, and they included pustules on
the left-hand index finger. The case was hospitalised on 7 Oct 2011
and received penicillin and ciprofloxacin intravenously. The patient
responded well to the treatment; the general condition is now good,
and the patient was discharged from hospital.

Background information
According to data published by the European Centre for Disease
Prevention and Control, the number of notified cases of anthrax
continues to be sporadic in Romania, as well as in other EU countries,
and are mainly related to occupational exposure. Between 2006 and
2008, 13 confirmed cases of anthrax were reported from 5 EU countries:
Romania (n=3), Spain (n=3), Bulgaria (n=3), Greece (n=2), United
Kingdom (n=2). Between 2008 and 2010, no confirmed cases of anthrax
were reported in Romania [6-8]. None of the 3 cases identified in
Romania between 2006 and 2008 were in the district where the cases
described in this report occurred. In some cases, the source of
infection was sick animals, and in others, the disease was contracted
due to possible contamination of pre-existing skin lesions with _B.
anthracis_ spores from the ground [9].

In the past 5 years, there were 2 cases of infection with _B.
anthracis_ in animals (pigs) in this district in 2009, 62 miles from
the district where the cases described here were located (data not
shown).

Laboratory investigation
On 10 Oct 2011, biological samples (smears from pustules from both
patients and CSF from Case 1 who presented with meningitis symptoms)
were sent for diagnostic tests to the National Reference Laboratory
for Zoonotic Infections, "Cantacuzino." Microscopic examination of the
smears from both cases and the CSF from Case 1 showed the presence of
Gram-positive rods, typical of _B. anthracis_. The sample from CSF
from Case 1 did not grow in culture.

The laboratory results, based on mouse inoculation and culture on
blood agar, were received on 13 Oct 2011 and confirmed the presence of
_B. anthracis_ in both cases.

Epidemiological investigation
In the epidemiological investigation, a _B. anthracis_-infected cow
from the village where the cases lived, slaughtered on 28 Sep 2011 in
a private backyard, was identified as the source of infection.
According to the local veterinarian, the cow had been vaccinated
against anthrax in April 2011, but on 11 Oct 2011, the district
Veterinary Department confirmed _B. anthracis_ in the meat of the
slaughtered cow. No other suspected human anthrax cases or
anthrax-suspected deaths in animals were reported in the village
previously or since this cluster.

Nine people were exposed to the infected animal through consumption of
its meat that was not thoroughly cooked, and 4 of them took part in
the slaughtering of the cow, including Case 1 described above. Even
though the 2nd case declared only having consumed the meat and not
having participated in the slaughtering, he was diagnosed with
cutaneous anthrax. He probably contracted the infection while handling
the raw or insufficiently cooked meat.

Control measures
All persons at risk and all household contacts of the cases are being
carefully monitored during the maximum incubation period (until 12 Nov
2011) by the local general practitioner. So far, none of them have
presented symptoms of anthrax.

Veterinary control measures included disinfection and decontamination
of the household where the cow had been slaughtered. All the remaining
meat of the slaughtered cow and its organs were collected and
incinerated. The Veterinary Department vaccinated all animals (cattle,
sheep, goats and horses) in the village against anthrax and banned the
movement of animals in or out of the village until immunity is
installed.

Conclusions
In this cluster, due to the rapid implementation of measures by the
local health authorities, after the suspected diagnosis in the index
case, the 2nd case was detected in a timely manner and treated
appropriately, thus preventing further spread of the disease. At
present, it is thought that the public health impact of this outbreak
is only local. The infected cow was raised in the village, and there
was no notification of the animal's movement to other localities. The
meat had not been sold commercially, and the village is not usually
visited by tourists.

The 2 anthrax cases described could have been prevented if the
national legislation that requires examining the animal carcasses in
authorised slaughtering units by the official veterinarian or by a
person nominated by the authority had been taken into account [Amen! -

[On the whole, anthrax is sporadic in Romania, with the occasional
overflow, as here, from slaughtered livestock into humans, e.g., 2009
in Botosani, where 2 dead cows infected 2 persons; the 3 pigs in the
Tulcea outbreak that year did not. The named counties with recent
outbreaks are Bistrita-Nasaud, Botosani, Constanta, Ialometa, Neamt,
Suceava, and Vaslui.

Actually, if you look at the dates, there was not a short interval
between exposure, 28 Sep 2011, and the onset of symptoms on 6 Oct 2011
by the index cases, who came to medical attention on the 7 Oct 2011.
"Short" in anthrax is from 2-4 days. The 2nd case's onset was 3 Oct
2011 and was found through back tracing and would probably have
recovered without treatment. The index case was unlucky -- he was the
only one out of the 5 butchering the carcass who was affected -- but
he raises an important point: meningoencephalitis from anthrax is much
more common than many realise and can be found in some 30-40 percent
of systemic cases. It is hard to treat successfully.

Tulcea is in the Danube Delta, an area with a long history of sporadic
anthrax outbreaks. To find it, go to:
