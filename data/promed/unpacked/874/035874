DISEASE SURVEILLANCE, TSUNAMI-RELATED - INDONESIA

I was in Indonesia from 3 to 22 Jan 2005, where I had been working with the
WHO and Indonesian MoH on disease surveillance in the tsunami-affected
areas of Aceh Province.
Surveillance in the provincial capital of Banda Aceh and the surrounding
districts includes active and passive surveillance in the IDP [internally
displaced persons] camps as well as hospital and laboratory surveillance.
Several public health labs with the capacity to confirm cholera, typhoid,
shigella, measles, malaria, dengue, Japanese encephalitis, hepatitis A & E
and other pathogens are fully operational in Banda Aceh.
The system is being replicated in the Meulaboh area on the West Coast of
Aceh Province, along with the establishment of a lab this week. Some areas
of the west coast are cut off except for helicopter access, due to the
destruction of more than 50 bridges along that coast; however, the
surviving population in these hardest-hit areas is generally quite low. In
some areas the mortality due to the tsunami was greater than 90 percent.
Medical teams working in all affected areas (including the isolated areas
of the West coast) have been provided with syndromic case definitions of
diseases of epidemic potential, including measles, bloody diarrhea, acute
watery diarrhea, suspected malaria, acute jaundice syndrome and others.
Epidemiologists are based in Aceh and Meulaboh, and some agencies providing
medical services have epidemiologists on staff. Suspected cases and
rumours/gossip (e.g., reports from the press and lay people) are being
investigated.
Appropriate specimens are being collected and transported to public health
labs. Standard treatment protocols have been distributed on paper and
electronic format.
As of 24 Jan 2005, there have been no confirmed outbreaks of cholera in any
part of the province. Rumours of cholera in an area adjacent to Meulaboh
have not been confirmed, but there were cases of uncomplicated diarrhea,
without deaths or severe dehydration.
Shigellosis has been [diagnosed in] 10 patients. Speciated specimens were
all _Shigella flexneri_. No _S. dysenteriae_ has been found. Water and
sanitation have been strengthened in the area most affected, and there has
been no further bloody diarrhea there since 19 Jan 2005. Bloody diarrhea
has also been reported from other areas of the province.
There have been sporadic cases of measles. A province-wide program of
measles immunization (from ages 6 months to 15 years) and vitamin A
distribution (6 months to 5 years) is in process, with priority given to
the areas where the surveillance has detected cases.
Risk of outbreaks of malaria and dengue remains high, due to a substantial
increase in the potential breeding sites for _Anopheles sundaicus_, _Aedes
aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_. A comprehensive program of vector control,
early diagnosis and treatment, and training for management of complicated
malaria has commenced.
As of 24 Jan 2005, more than 90 patients at hospitals in Banda Aceh,
Meulaboh (west coast), and Sigli (northeast coast) were diagnosed with
tetanus. All seem to be the result of injuries sustained on the day of the
tsunami, with the peak being passed on 12 Jan 2005. Hospitals are equipped
to manage cases, and there is a preventive program for workers involved in
the clean-up campaign (protective clothing and tetanus toxoid
immunization). New cases are on the decline.
2 patients with suspected cases of melioidosis are hospitalized in
Meulaboh. The cases are being investigated.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Stewart for his timely response to our RFI regarding
cholera in the tsunami-affected areas of Indonesia. In the larger sense,
we thank -- in the strongest, most sincere terms -- Dr. Stewart and the
many, many like him who have responded to this horrible tragedy. - Mod.LL]
