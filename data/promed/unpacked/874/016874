Sri Lanka: Hand, Foot and Mouth disease spreading fast
-----------------------------------------------
An outbreak of a viral infection affecting young children, commonly
known as Hand, Foot and Mouth disease (HFMD) is spreading fast in
Colombo, Sri Lanka. Doctors warn that the numbers of cases in other
areas of the country too has seen a sharp increase.
The disease typically affects children under the age of 5, but older
children and adults could occasionally be susceptible. Consultant
Dermatologist of the Lady Ridgeway Hospital, Dr. J.K. Seneviratne,
confirming the outbreak of the disease, said that symptoms of
infection include slight fever, loss of appetite, sore throat, and a
rash of red spots which develop into small vesicles or fluid
containing blisters in the mouth, diaper area and hands and feet
including the palms and soles.
The blisters are like those caused by chicken pox but do not itch.
They do, however, cause pain if pressed. There is no specific
treatment other than pain relief. Recovery takes between one week to
10 days. Dr. Seneviratne added that in extremely rare cases
convulsions and paralysis had occurred. He said these complications
last occurred in a 1999 epidemic, which occurred in Hong Kong. He
stressed complications were extremely rare and said there was no need
to panic. He said once the disease was contracted, patients became
immune to it.
Dr. P.H. Chandrawansa, Consultant Dermatologist of the Matara General
Hospital, confirmed a sharp increase in the number of affected
children and warned that the disease spreads mainly through oral or
droplet transmission. He advised stringent hand cleansing and that
young children avoid contact with affected patients.

[HFMD is a common illness of infants and children, which has tended
to be more severe in south Asia than elsewhere. It is characterized
by fever, sores in the mouth, and a rash with blisters. It can be
caused by several viruses, the most frequent of which are
coxsackievirus A16 and by enterovirus 71. HFMD caused by
coxsackievirus A16 infection is a mild disease, and most patients
recover without medical treatment in 7 to 10 days. Rarely, the
patient with coxsackievirus A16 infection may also develop "aseptic"
or viral meningitis and may need to be hospitalized for a few days.
Enterovvirus 71 may also cause viral meningitis and, rarely, more
serious diseases, such as encephalitis, or a poliomyelitis-like
paralysis. Enterovirus 71 encephalitis may be fatal. Cases of fatal
encephalitis occurred during outbreaks of HFMD in Malaysia in 1997
and in Taiwan in 1998. Investigation of HFMD in Sarawak by Podin et
al. (BMC Public Health. 2006 Jul 7;6:180) revealed that enterovirus
71 outbreaks occurred in a cyclical pattern every 3 years and that
coxsackievirus A16 co-circulated with human enterovirus 71. The
causative agent of the HFMD outbreak in Sri Lanka remains to be
established. - Mod.CP]
