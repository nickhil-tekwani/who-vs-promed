"I'm getting more questions about silver scurf at harvest," said Andy Robinson, North Dakota State and Minnesota Universities. Potato growers see the disease as a growing threat. Amanda Gevens, University of Wisconsin, also is seeing more silver scurf, a common potato disease found in all major production areas of the United States.

Efforts to combat silver scurf are complicated by its close resemblance to black dot, another crop disease. "Sometimes you can't tell them apart," [she said]. One important difference: silver scurf is tied to infected seed, while black dot is more of a soil/field debris issue. No commercial cultivars resistant to silver scurf are available yet, though work to develop them is underway.

Use of uninfected seed, which can be hard to get, helps to control the disease, as does early harvest and chemical use. Storage conditions also influence the extent of silver scurf in affected potatoes.

[Silver scurf of potato is caused by the fungus _Helminthosporium solani_. Symptoms include small brown spots on tuber skins forming a "scurf" which may appear silvery when wet. The scurf is often found near the tuber's end and is confined to the surface. In storage, symptoms may continue to develop and spread; affected tubers may show increased water loss and shrinkage resulting in lower weights. Silver scurf may also increase susceptibility of plants to secondary infections and is suspected to decrease vigour of seed tubers. The disease can cause substantial economic losses due to a lower market value of disfigured tubers and may have implications on export trade from affected areas.

The pathogen is spread with infected tubers and soil, but survival time in soil appears to be rather limited. Infected seed potatoes are often the source of new outbreaks and volunteer potatoes may serve as pathogen reservoirs in a field. Disease management requires an integrated approach and may include crop rotation with non-host species of at least 2 years, fungicides as seed tuber treatments, phytosanitary measures and appropriate storage and handling procedures. Use of certified clean planting material is essential. Biocontrol agents are being investigated. Little information is available on the relative susceptibility of potato varieties, but symptoms are less obvious in some cultivars (for example in those with russet skins).

Silver scurf is considered an emerging disease of increasing economic importance in many potato producing regions, including North America where it has been increasing in incidence and severity in recent decades.

Black dot of potato is caused by the fungus _Colletotrichum coccodes_. The pathogen can also affect other crops such as tomato, soybean, oilseed rape, oats and lucerne. It is soil borne and may be spread by infected plant debris, tubers, soil and mechanical means. Since conditions for disease development are similar for both pathogens, they can occur simultaneously on tubers to form a significant disease complex called silver scurf-black dot.
