The Rensselaer County [New York state] Health Department is urging residents to take precautions to prevent exposure to tick-borne diseases including Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, and babesiosis.

The warning stems from a significant increase in the number of cases of anaplasmosis found in Rensselaer County in 2015 particularly in the Hoosick Falls/Petersburg region, according to a release from the health department.

Anaplasmosis is a bacterial infection, like Lyme disease, transmitted by the bite of an infected tick. Some ticks can pass both anaplasmosis and Lyme disease, as well as a less common disease called babesiosis. The 1st symptoms of anaplasmosis typically begin within 1-3 weeks after the bite by an infected tick. Infection leads to flu-like symptoms, including fever, headache, muscle pain, weakness, chills, and nausea. Unlike Lyme disease, a rash is not common with anaplasmosis. The infection usually produces mild to moderately severe illness.

The disease can be very severe in people with weak immune systems. Drug treatment for anaplasmosis is similar to that of Lyme disease.

To prevent exposure:
- avoid wooded and bushy areas with high grass;
- walk in the center of trails;
- wear repellent with DEET on skin or clothing;
- take a bath or shower within 2 hours of coming indoors to wash off and more easily find ticks;
- conduct a full-body tick check under arms, ears, the belly button, backs of knees, between legs, around the waist, and in and around all head and body hair;
- examine gear and pets. Ticks can come in on clothing and pets and attach to a person later;
- tumble clothes in a dryer on high heat for an hour to kill remaining ticks

[_Anaplasma phagocytophilum_, the causative agent of anaplasmosis, typically is transmitted to humans by infected _Ixodes_ spp. ticks. In wooded areas of the USA, _A. phagocytophilum_ is transmitted by the blacklegged tick (_Ixodes scapularis_) in the Northeast and upper Midwest and by the western blacklegged tick (_Ixodes pacificus_) on the West Coast.

In infected persons who are symptomatic, illness onset occurs 5-21 days after a bite from an infected tick. Initial presentation typically includes sudden onset of fever, headache, malaise, and myalgia, often accompanied by thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and elevated liver transaminases. Severe infections can include prolonged fever, shock, confusion, seizures, pneumonitis, renal failure, hemorrhages, opportunistic infections, and death. - Mod.
