A highly contagious virus that 1st entered the United States last year [2013] is now killing thousands of pigs in West Michigan. While the porcine epidemic diarrhea [PED] virus leads to vomiting and diarrhea in adult pigs, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it primarily kills baby pigs.

Growing up on her family's farm, Erin Ehinger of Holland [Michigan] has spent countless hours working with the animals. But, for the 1st year ever, she witnessed the devastating effects of PED after it claimed the life of thousands of baby pigs. "It was amazing how fast they got sick, and then we had another barn that had the same symptoms and they got really sick and dehydrated, and within a couple of days the little babies started dying," Ehinger, of Dykhuis Farms, said.

According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, bacon prices have increased by more than 13 per cent. In a report issued by Rabobank, PED has impacted nearly 60 per cent of the breeding herd in the US.

"It has been awful on people, because we are pig farmers and we love caring for our pigs and we do our best every day to make sure they're healthy and well cared for, and just to come in and see sick pigs is really hard on people," Ehinger said. The virus passes from pig to pig, or from the hands and clothing of humans. Eginger said she's not sure how the virus entered the farm, but that it's also had a big impact on the family business. "We raise pigs so that we can produce pork, and when pigs die, we can't sell pigs for pork," Ehinger said. "It was a big deal; we lost about 3 weeks of pigs."

While the virus is fatal in pigs, it cannot be passed to humans, and the meat is safe for consumption.

[This disease moves rapidly and is devastating a piggery. It is having a very negative impact on the swine industry. Consumers are likely to see more of an increase in the price of pork products if this disease is not controlled quickly.
