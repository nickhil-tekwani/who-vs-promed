According to the Houston Chronicle July 23, 1998 and Texas Department of
Health News Update July 21, 1998 <updates.htm@www.tdh.state.tx.us> from
July 1 - July 21 TDH has recorded 368 cases of diarrheal disease caused by
_Vibrio parahaemolyticus_. These were: Texas-276, Florida- 50,
Oklahoma-12, Georgia-9, Tennessee-6 Colorado-3 and California-1 (11 cases
location unspecified). The latest illness onset date was July 2.
Laboratory tests have confirmed _V. parahaemolyticus_ as the cause of
illness in at least 66 of the 368 cases.
The Chronicle reports that "health experts and people in the shellfish
industry are meeting this week at the Interstate Shellfish Sanitation
Conference in San Diego to review lab test results and determine how to
prevent a recurrence and when to reopen harvesting in Galveston Bay.
Dr. Bruce Elliott, who heads the state's microbiology lab in Austin, said
there are dozens of strains of _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ but only one has
been identified in victims of the current outbreak.
Speculation continues as the cause, with drought together with high
temperatures thought to be contributing factors. There is a suggestion that
this one particular strain may be more "potent" and therefore harmful in
lower concentrations than other strains, however this remains to be
established.
A recent publication in Infection and Immunity "Effect of mild acid
treatment on survival, enteropathogenicity and protein production in
_Vibrio parahaemolyticus_". Hin-Chung Wong et al. I&I 1998.66(7):3066
discusses how adaptation to an unfavourable environment may additionally
enhance the ability of this microorganism to survive passage through
stomach acid to reach the intestine.

[Without knowing which strains of VP are endemic to Galveston Bay it would
be premature to ascribe the epidemic strain's success to it being more
"potent". For all we know there may have been only one strain in the bay.
This organism does not need humans to survive. - Mod.MHJ
