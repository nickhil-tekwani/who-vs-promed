The reappearance of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) put Chilean health
officials on high alert Tuesday after the virus left three members of one
family dead in the Bio Bio region of southern Chile.
The victims, a 10-year-old boy, his grandmother, 52, and the boy's
great-uncle, 70, all died within the past 40 days in the town of Mulchen,
541 kilometers (336 miles) south of Santiago, health officials said. With
the outbreak of the virus, principally transmitted in Chile by the small
long-tail rat [_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_, regional health officials
issued a special alert for the entire area, near the Andes mountains.
However, it is possible that the long-tail rat is not the only carrier.
Dr. Hernan Rojas said that the three victims certainly had access to the
same source of infection.
The Health Ministry said that from 1 Jan 1999 to 15 Sep 1999, 17 cases of
HPS had been reported, fewer than the 31 cases reported in 1998.
