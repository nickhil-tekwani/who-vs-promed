Drs. Erica Cline and David Farr recently [May 2006] reviewed the
fungi on the APHIS Regulated Plant Pest List, providing an accurate
scientific name as well as the disease, plant hosts, and geographic
distribution for each species. In presenting these data they remained
neutral on which of these fungi pose a threat to U.S. agriculture and
forest resources because such an evaluation was beyond the scope of
that project. However, the purpose of such a document is so that
someone or some organization can do just that -- evaluate the threat
posed by these fungi. Once the fungi that threaten U.S. agriculture
are known, activities can be directed at preventing the entry of
those organisms. An evaluation of the potential threat of fungi on
the APHIS Regulated Plant Pest List was conducted by the federal
interagency Invasive Terrestrial Arthropods and Pathogens (ITAP)
Subcommittee on Plant Pathogens using the data provided in Cline and
Farr (1). Each species was evaluated based on the!
importance of the plant host, geographic distribution, and state of
knowledge. Fungi that cause serious diseases of plants of major
economic value and forest trees were considered a threat if the
fungus does not occur in the United States. If the species is
reported more than once in the United States and these reports are in
the literature or backed by voucher specimens, the species is
considered to be established in the United States. Some fungal
pathogens occur on crops that are not grown in the United States but
are important to the U.S. economy. For some fungi not enough is known
to make an evaluation; in fact, some species have not been seen since
their original description often decades ago. The pathogens that are
a threat to major crop plants are as follows;
_Elsinoe australis_ on citrus; South America
_Monilinia fructigena_ on apples, pears, and peaches; Europe, Asia,
South America
_Peronosclerospora maydis_ on corn; Asia, Australia, South America
_Peronosclerospora sacchari_ on sugarcane; Asia, Australia, Central America
_Peronosclerospora philippinensis_ on corn (select agent), Asia, Africa
_Scerophthora rayssiae var. zeae_ on corn (select agent), Asia
_Synchytrium endobioticum_ on potato (eradicated from US, select
agent); Europe, Asia, Africa, North America (Canada)
_Thekopsora areolata_ on Prunus; Europe, Asia, Caribbean
_Urocystis agropyri_ on wheat (possibly in US); Europe, Asia, Africa,
South America, Australia
Pathogens for which there is not enough known to determine threat are
as follows;
_Diaporthe mali_ on apples
_Guignardia pyricola_ on apples and pears
_Gymnosporangium asiatica_ (_Roestelia koreensis_) on pear (in US
based on old specimens, possible misidentifications)
_Melanomma glumarum_ on rice
_Oospora oryzetorum_ on rice (not a fungus)
_Pestalotiopsis disseminata_ on banana
_Pseudopezicula tracheiphila_ on grapes
_Rhacodiella vitis_ on grape (known only from type)
_Septoria melanosa_ on grape (reported in North America?)
Attention should be paid to preventing the entry of these fungi.
Interestingly, many of these are rust fungi. In synthesizing the
geographic distribution of these fungi, all of these species occur in
Asia. It would appear that Asia serves as a source for pathogens that
threaten U.S. agriculture although many occur elsewhere in the world
as well especially in Europe where the fungi are more well-known.
Many of these pathogens could enter the U.S. on nursery stock. The
cause of Karnal bunt, _Tilletia indica_, on wheat has a restricted
distribution in the United States and Mexico as well as Asia and
causes limited loss of quality. The fungal species about which not
enough is known to determine if they are a threat should be the
subject of research.

[An evaluation of fungal pathogens that could pose a potential threat
to crops in the USA and which are of interest to ProMED-mail is
provided above. It was edited down from the full article (see main
link) which is based on the APHIS Regulated Plant Pest List. The full
article included fungal pathogens of trees and ornamental plants. The
evaluation was conducted by the federal interagency Invasive
Terrestrial Arthropods and Pathogens (ITAP) Subcommittee on Plant
Pathogens using the data provided in Cline and Farr. Fungi that
cause serious diseases of plants of major economic value were
considered a threat if the fungus does not occur in the United
States. The authors comment on the fact that many of the pathogens
are rust fungi and that all can be found causing diseases in Asia.
The only previous posting found in ProMED-mail using 'APHIS' and
'Regulated' deal with karnal bunt, and they have not been included
here.
