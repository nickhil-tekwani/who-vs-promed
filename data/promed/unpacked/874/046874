[If the positive RT-PCR results above mean infection with the novel
A/H1N1 swine virus, the causative agent of the current pandemic, this
will become the world's 2nd confirmed infection in swine with the said
virus. The 1st case occurred in Canada during April 2009, when pigs in
an Alberta commercial farm were found infected with the pandemic
virus. Similarly to the current Argentinean information and in line
with experimental infection trials in pigs, carried out in the UK and
in the USA, the A/H1N1 infection in pigs was practically subclinical.
A suspicion that the infection in Canada was introduced by a person
after his return from Mexico was later excluded.

Results of the current investigation in Argentina about the possible
role of 2 persons as origin of pig infection is anticipated with great
interest. - Mod.AS]
