Bird Flu May Have Killed Thai Tigers
------------------------------
The bird flu epidemic that has killed 31 people in southeast Asia this year
may also have killed 23 tigers at a zoo in eastern Thailand, a cabinet
minister said Tuesday.

"I've received a report this morning that 23 tigers have died and some
others have been sick," Deputy Prime Minister Chaturon Chaisang told
reporters. "Their preliminary signs showed they might have caught bird
flu," said Chaturon, who is in charge of the Thai battle against bird flu.

"The test on the dead tigers showed they were infected with the H5N1
virus," Charal Trinwuthipong, a special adviser to the Public Health
Ministry's bird flu committee, told reporters on Tuesday.

The tigers, aged between 8 months and 2 years, died with flu-like signs
after they had been fed raw chicken at the Sri Racha Tigers Zoo, 80 km (50
miles) east of Bangkok, Charal said. The zoo had been closed since Tuesday
because tigers started dying on 14 Oct 2004, and about 30 of some 400
tigers in the zoo were ill, officials said. "We believe all the sick ones
might have caught bird flu given that they had been fed with the chicken
meat from the same processing company," Charal said.

A clouded leopard died in similar fashion at a Thai zoo earlier in 2004,
and scientific studies have shown since then that cats can be infected with
avian flu, which means pets could spread the disease.

5 keepers had been put under surveillance after showing flu-like symptoms,
but the other 800 workers employed by the zoo and the processing firm had
shown no signs of illness, Charal said.

The fear underlying the bird flu epidemic, which swept through much of Asia
early in 2004, is that the H5N1 avian flu virus could get into an animal
that can also host a human flu virus, most likely a pig. That could
produce a mutation that could spread through a human population with no
immunity to it and lead to a pandemic like the 1918-19 Spanish flu, which
killed an estimated 20 million people around the world.

However, the World Health Organization (WHO) said the deaths of the tigers
had no implications for humans, as tigers are not known to host the human
influenza virus and thus could not serve as a lethal mixing vessel.

[According to the Asia News website, the zoo was raided and approximately
450 tigers were confiscated, 53 of which tested positive for H5N1.

Influenza viruses are quite adaptable; various strains move between birds,
swine, and even humans. The possibility of its moving within a tiger
population is reasonable if the virus has adapted to this host.

It appears that some of the workers of these tiger facilities are under
observation. Should these workers develop clinical signs of the flu that
can be connected to the tigers, then the implications for domestic cats and
their owners becomes a new source of concern. - Mod.TG]
