Authorities in Mubende district are on a high alert following the outbreak of a strange disease which has claimed the lives of at least 5 people. The strange disease, which has symptoms of high fever, vomiting and passing of blood, was 1st reported last week in Kalezi village.

Dr Bosco Ssendikadiwa, the assistant Mubende district health officer, says that the 5th person died on Tuesday [24 Jul 2018] morning. He says that medical workers suspected it was haemorrhagic fever.

Ssendikadiwa, however, says that the results sent to the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) tested negative to haemorrhagic fever.

"There is a disease which is killing our people, and, so far, 4 died last week, and one died last night. Last week, we took samples of those found sick and the deceased, and they were sent for investigations. We were suspecting haemorrhagic fever, but they were negative for haemorrhagic fever," Ssendikadwa said.

According to a resident of Kalezi, the 1st victim, BT, vomited blood and died on his way to hospital. She, however, says that no postmortem was carried out to establish the cause.

The district surveillance team has been sent to monitor and establish the cause of the disease. An isolation centre has also been set up at Mubende Regional Referral Hospital.

[The above report mentions that the cases have tested negative for hemorrhagic fever, but CCHF is not specified. There have been earlier reports of CCHF cases and deaths from this same district during May-June [2018], according to a Health Ministry statement issued at that time and as reported in ProMED posts (see below).

Indeed, the fact that there have been 5 deaths due to an as yet unidentifiable cause, but with common clinical symptoms, all including a hemorrhagic component as well, merits further epidemiological investigation supported by laboratory confirmation. In the meantime, implementation of protective measures would be imperative; ensuring proper isolation of the suspected cases, strict infection control practices, use of personal protective equipment by health care personnel, as well as public/community education will be helpful.

ProMED would appreciate any updates or confirmatory information on the current cases from the concerned officials/personnel. - Mod.UBA
