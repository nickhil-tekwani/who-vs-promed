Cameroon - 10 000 pigs destroyed
--------------------------------
Cameroon has slaughtered and burned at least 10 450 pigs during the
past 2 weeks as part of stringent measures to fight an outbreak of
African swine fever, a contagious disease that affects pigs,
state-run Cameroon Radio Television (CRTV) reported Monday [12 Jul 2010].

The radio said the disease broke out in May [2010] in the north
regional locality of Mayo Rey, on the country's eastern border with
Chad and the Central African Republic.

[According to Cameroon's information on OIE's website, ASF is
endemic, "limited to one or more zones," and the prevailing control
measures include "modified stamping out." During 2009, 19 outbreaks
were reported, involving a total of 531 cases. 178 pigs were,
reportedly, destroyed and 62 slaughtered. The outbreaks were recorded
in 5 regions: Centre, East, Littoral, South-west and South.

Mayo Ray is situated in Cameroon's North province; see map at
<http://healthmap.org/r/01Jv>. The number of pigs said to be
destroyed during the current outbreak is exceptionally high; has this
been an introduction of the disease into a hitherto uninfected area?
Confirmation and clarification will help. - Mod.AS]
