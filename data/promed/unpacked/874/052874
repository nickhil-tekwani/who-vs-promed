Pieter van Thiel from the Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam,
has send valuable information about 2 Dutch patients with African
trypanosomiasis that were infected recently in Tarangire NP, Tanzania.
More European tourists infected with sleeping sickness in Tanzania
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The first patient (male, about 60 years of age) was seen mid March 2001, in
the Harbour Hospital and Institute for Tropical Diseases in Rotterdam. He
only visited Tarangire National Park [south east of Serengeti.
The second patient (female, 55 years of age) was presented at our Tropical
Medicine Clinic (Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam) on 7 Apr
2001 after developing fever and headache 4 April. She visited Tarangire
National Park 2 weeks before with husband and daughter; no other parks were
entered. The patient remembered she had been bitten by Tsetse flies. The
diagnosis of trypanosomiasis was made at the Nordic Clinic in Dar es Salaam

[TropMedEurope has now reported 8 cases of sleeping sickness from East
Africa during the past 9 months, and one more case has been reported in an
American tourist. There are still no data suggesting an increase in
sleeping sickness in the local population. However, this probably reflects
the ineffectiveness of the reporting system rather than an absence of
disease in the population. - Mod.EP
