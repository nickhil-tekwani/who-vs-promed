This is to communicate the growing number of cases of dengue in Santos,
littoral of the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil.
The State Health Secretary said that at least 4567 people were
infected between 1 January & 4 June 1999. The number of cases in
1998 was 4134, which was an increase of 388% on the 847
infected in 1997. Dr. Di Renzo, regional director of health in Santos,
said that this is due to failure in the prophylaxis in 1997.
