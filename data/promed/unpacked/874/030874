1st report of canola powdery mildew caused by _Erysiphe polygoni_ in Argentina.
-----------------------------------------------
S. Gaetan and M. Madia, Catedra de Fitopatologia, Facultad de Agronomia,
Universidad de Buenos Aires, Avda San Martin 4453, 1417, Buenos Aires,
Argentina. Plant Dis. 88:1163, 2004; published on-line as D-2004-0722-01N,
2004. Accepted for publication 13 Jul 2004.
Canola (_Brassica napus_) is a developing oleaginous crop grown
commercially in the Buenos Aires and Santa Fe provinces of Argentina.
During the autumn of 2003, typical signs of powdery mildew were observed on
canola plants in experimental field plots in Buenos Aires. Average disease
incidence was 42 percent on 3- to 6-month-old canola cultivars developed in
the following countries: Argentina (Eclipse, Impulse Master, Mistral, and
Nolza); Australia (Oscar and Rainbow); Canada (Sentry); France (Cadillac,
Camberra, and Capitol); and Sweden (Maskot, Sponsor, and Wildcat).
The range of incidence on these cultivars was 35 to 93 percent. Other
cultivars exhibited an apparent high level of resistance or escaped
disease. These included: Charlton (Argentina); 46CO3, Dunkeld, Insignia,
Mystic, Monty, Outback, Rivette, and Surpass 400 (Australia), and Caviar
(France).
Climatic conditions in Buenos Aires, especially rainfall, from March to May
2003 were apparently favorable for powdery mildew development. On
susceptible cultivars, fungal growth was observed on leaves, stems, and
pods that resulted in premature senescence of the tissues. The mycelium,
with multilobed hausthoria, was white to gray, dense or fine, and in
patches or covering the entire adaxial leaf surfaces.
Appressoria were lobed and conidiophores were straight. Foot cells were
cylindrical, straight, measured 35 to 42 x 7 to 10 millimicrons, and were
followed by 2 cells.
Conidia were produced singly, cylindrical to ovoid, and measured 36 to 40 x
18 to 20 millimicrons. The conidial length-to-width ratio was 2.0. No
fibrosin bodies were observed in the conidia and conidia germinated at the
ends. Cleistothecia were not observed. On the basis of mycelial, conidial,
and hausthoria characteristics observed on 6 leaves for each affected
cultivar, the fungus was identified as _Erysiphe polygoni_ DC (1).
Pathogenicity was confirmed on 5-week-old canola plants of cvs. Eclipse,
Impulse, Master, Mistral, and Maskot by gently pressing (one min.) one
adaxial infected leaf with abundant sporulation onto one adaxial healthy
leaf. The experiment, which included 5 inoculated plants and 3
noninoculated control plants for each cultivar, was conducted in a
greenhouse at 22 to 24 C and maintained at 75 percent relative humidity
with no supplemental light. Inoculated and control plants were covered with
polyethylene bags for 48 h after inoculation. Powdery mildew developed on
all inoculated plants of all cultivars after 12 to 14 days. The control
plants did not develop disease. The experiment was repeated with similar
results.
_E. polygoni_ has a worldwide distribution (2); however, the results
suggest that this fungus may be a threat to the main cultivars being grown
in Argentina (Eclipse, Impulse, Master, Mistral, and Nolza), since high
levels of disease incidence, as much as 70 percent, were observed. Under
propitious environments, this pathogen could cause severe yield losses in
commercially grown canola in Argentina.
To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of canola powdery mildew caused by
_E. polygoni_ in Argentina.

[_Erisyphe poloygoni_ [Eg] grows on the surfaces of leaves and stems. Older
infected leaves yellow and wither, and growth of heavily infected plants is
diminished. The disease is favored by moderate temperatures. Eg produces
airborne spores that facilitate spread of the disease. Moisture is not
necessary for germination and infection, and is actually detrimental to the
fungus. Several powdery mildew fungicides are effective if applied in a
regular preventative program commencing with the 1st signs of the fungus.
Disease management depends upon the use of resistant cultivars,
applications of registered fungicides in rotation to delay evolution of
resistant strains of Eg, crop rotation, and removal of old plant debris.
