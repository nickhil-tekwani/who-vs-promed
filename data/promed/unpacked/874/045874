North central Wisconsin is in the middle of an outbreak of pertussis, according to the Marathon County Health Department. "We're seeing more cases than we would normally expect this time of year," said Ruth Marx, epidemiologist with the department. "We're up past 100 confirmed cases."

The Health Department is working with area school districts: D.C. Everest, Wausau, Mosinee, Marathon and Newman Catholic, to help prevent the spread of the illness. Letters have been sent to parents of students who are classmates of children with whooping cough. If children who came in contact with others who have pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, exhibit signs of cold symptoms, they should stay home and see a physician. People who are found to have whooping cough, and those who come in close contact with those who are ill, are prescribed a regimen of antibiotics.

Most healthy teens and adults can recover from the illness, Marx said. But it's particularly dangerous to babies 6 months or younger or those who have compromised immune systems. "It kills infants," Marx said. "Infants haven't received a full series of immunizations until they're 6 months old."

Ravalli County reported one more pertussis case Tuesday [17 Apr 2012]. That's a total of 15 confirmed whooping cough cases in the Bitterroot.

The latest case is another child. 14 children are now sick with pertussis. Only one adult has tested positive. Most of the cases are in Pinesdale. Some are in the Corvallis area.

"The Corvallis school system is increasing surveillance," said public health director Judy Griffin. "The school nurse has been diligently talking with teachers and possible contacts."

Randolph County has 15 cases of pertussis, also known as whooping cough, and health director Mimi Cooper said many of the cases are related to the 129 cases in Alamance County. "We can connect those children to each other. They've spent time with each other during the period the children were incubating the disease," Cooper said.

Guilford County has had 5 cases of whooping cough in 2012. Cooper said those cases were also related to the Alamance outbreak, but the Guilford County Health Department could not confirm that.

Cooper said pertussis, which can be fatal in infants younger than 6 months, is that serious of an infliction. "It's not intended to be punishing for the children or the school. We are trying to prevent children from dying," Cooper said.

Four cases of pertussis, or whooping cough, were identified in Broward County this week, health officials said. The health department said 3 young children and one adult had confirmed cases. Since the beginning of 2012, several counties throughout the state have reported higher levels of pertussis.

[Recommendations on the use of acellular pertussis vaccines in the USA continue to expand in efforts to cocoon susceptible neonates to prevent the substantial morbidity and mortality in infants who have not been yet adequately immunized like the one described in the Colorado posting. The use of the vaccine in pregnant women further expands these recommendations. It is likely, given the limited number of contacts 5-week-old infants have, that the reservoir of the infant was a family member.

The increasing susceptibility in older children and adults to pertussis, usually manifesting as chronic cough without the typical "whoop," after appropriate primary immunization continues to be increasingly reported. Waning immunity is generally thought to be the cause of the problem, but it is increasingly clear that _Bordetella pertussis_ clones are being selected, against which we are no longer as well protected with the current vaccines. - Mod.LL
