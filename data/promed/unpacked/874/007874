An international team of physicians is investigating an outbreak of an
unidentified infection that sickened about 25% of the population of four
remote villages in southern Sudan, and killed about 20% of those who fell
ill.
The outbreak occurred in a roadless region near the Ethiopian border among
people who have scarcely any contact with the outside world. It began in
late July and was over by the end of September, shortly before a team
headed by the World Health Organization (WHO) arrived. The only contact
with the area during the epidemic came in early August, when a Sudanese
medical agency sent in eight investigators, two of whom became ill and one
of whom died.
The disease [was] characterized by pneumonia that is often rapidly fatal.
Preliminary analysis of blood samples has ruled out most viruses as the
cause, including Ebola virus, which killed 151 people in southern Sudan in
1976 in one of the first two recorded epidemics of that disease. Many
bacteria have also been ruled out.
"There are no viable candidates [as a cause for the disease] now. We really
don't know," said David L. Heymann, head of WHO's division of communicable
diseases.
It is possible the illness was caused by a known, common pathogen [which]
the population has never been exposed to because of its extreme isolation.
Measles and influenza, for example, cause high mortality in unexposed
populations.
However, "if it was something new, then it is very worrisome because it
could act the same in other populations," Heymann said.
Of roughly 2,000 people in the four villages, 110 died. After interviewing
survivors and other villagers, the epidemiologists estimated that at least
550 people had come down with the illness.
That "case-fatality" rate of 20% is low compared with some infections. In
outbreaks of Ebola hemorrhagic fever, for example, 50-90% of people who
become ill die. Nevertheless, the high prevalence of the infection,
combined with its mortality, worries the WHO investigators.
"If 5% of a population dies within a three-month period, that makes it a
significant event even within a developing country setting," said Thomas
Grein, an epidemiologist at the WHO's Geneva headquarters who was part of
the international team.
"The only good thing about this sad event is that it occurred in such a
small population. If you extrapolate this to a much larger population, then
it would be quite horrendous."
The village complex is called Meyon, and is in a savanna about 3,500 feet
above sea level east of the Sudanese town of Boma. It took the WHO team 13
hours on foot to reach the area from the last road. Much of the trip was
through 6-foot-high grass. They forded four rivers.
The four villages are separated from one another by walks of 30 minutes to
two hours duration. The inhabitants are exclusively farmers, growing corn
and sorghum, and keeping some goats and poultry. Although there is famine
in parts of southern Sudan, this area is relatively prosperous, and Grein
said the people were healthy and well-nourished.
The illness struck all age groups. Infants and toddlers accounted for 6% of
the deaths; older children, 23%; adults, 55%; and the elderly, 16%.
The epidemiologists identified no "risk factors" for infection other than
contact with other people who were ill. For that reason, they are
reasonably certain the microbe is transmitted through the air in close
quarters. In a sub-sample of a village, they found that 42% of households
had no cases of the illness, 33% had one, 18% had two, and 7% had more than
two.
The incubation for the illness was about five days, and people who became
seriously ill died in about two days, with fever and a cough producing
bloody phlegm. This picture more closely fits a bacterial cause than a
viral one, Grein said.
Some of the roughly 40 blood samples carried out by the investigators show
signs of streptococcal infection. Three people who were given ampicillin --
an antibiotic effective against strep and many other bacteria -- by the
original Sudanese medical team recovered. However, streptococcal pneumonia
rarely occurs in epidemics, and Heymann said the pathogen would be an
unlikely explanation for the outbreak.
The team that visited Meyon during the epidemic was from an organization
called Sudan Medical Care. Two of its members became ill, and one died,
when they returned to Boma in August. A woman in Boma was apparently also
infected by one of them, but recovered.

[I believe this is the same epidemic that was earlier considered one of
"acute hemorrhagic fever syndrome". If so, the location is in Kashipo
village, Boma, Eastern Equatoria. This is a disturbing report and we look
forward to receiving more information about it. - Mod.CHC]
