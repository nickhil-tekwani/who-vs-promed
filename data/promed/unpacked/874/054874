CDC recommends COVID-19 vaccines for young children
---------------------------------------------------
Today [Sat 18 Jun 2022], CDC director Rochelle P Walensky endorsed the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices' (ACIP) recommendation that all children 6 months through 5 years of age should receive a COVID-19 vaccine. This expands eligibility for vaccination to nearly 20 million additional children and means that all Americans ages 6 months and older are now eligible for vaccination.

Parents and caregivers can now get their children 6 months through 5 years of age vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines to better protect them from COVID-19. All children, including children who have already had COVID-19, should get vaccinated.

COVID-19 vaccines have undergone -- and will continue to undergo -- the most intensive safety monitoring in US history. Parents and caregivers can play an active role in monitoring the safety of these vaccines by signing their children up for v-safe: personalized and confidential health check-ins via text messages and web surveys where they can easily share with CDC how a child feels after getting a COVID-19 vaccine.

Distribution of pediatric vaccinations for these younger children has started across the country, and will be available at thousands of pediatric practices, pharmacies, federally qualified health centers, local health departments, clinics, and other locations this week. Children in this younger age group can be vaccinated with whichever vaccine is available (either Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech). Parents can reach out to their doctor, nurse, local pharmacy, or health department, or visit <vaccines.gov> to see where vaccines for children are available.

The following is attributable to CDC director Dr Walensky: "Together, with science leading the charge, we have taken another important step forward in our nation's fight against COVID-19. We know millions of parents and caregivers are eager to get their young children vaccinated, and with today's decision, they can. I encourage parents and caregivers with questions to talk to their doctor, nurse, or local pharmacist to learn more about the benefits of vaccinations and the importance of protecting their children by getting them vaccinated."

North Korea recorded 18 820 more cases of fever and no new deaths amid its first official COVID-19 outbreak, state media said on [Mon 20 Jun 2022], as authorities continue to insist infections in the impoverished country are being brought under control.

The country has reported more than 4.6 million cases of fever during its first official outbreak, but authorities have not revealed how many of those patients tested positive for the coronavirus. Authorities on [Fri 17 Jun 2022] reported more than 23 100 cases of fever, marking the 3rd consecutive day in which reported infections stayed below 30 000.

Before acknowledging the outbreak in mid-May [2022], Pyongyang had claimed to be free of COVID-19, a record doubted by many observers due to the coronavirus' acute transmissibility and the country's vast land border with China. The regime has refused outside help, including vaccinations, despite widespread malnutrition and a dilapidated healthcare system.

The World Health Organization has expressed scepticism about North Korea's claim that the outbreak is waning, warning that cases are underreported, and the situation could be deteriorating. Officially known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), the country has reported just 73 deaths so far, well below what would be expected for an outbreak involving millions of infections.

DPRK also reported last week an outbreak of an unidentified gastrointestinal disease, suspected to be cholera or typhoid, in the country's southwest.

Tim Peters, the founder of Seoul-based aid organisation Helping Hands Korea Seoul, said it is likely North Korea is underplaying the extent of the crisis in the country. "What else but COVID-19 could the sudden 4.6 million fevers since the DPRK's mid-May admission of COVID-19 cases be? Authorities there have every reason to be gravely concerned that its rickety medical system will suffer a tsunami of cases and be overwhelmed," Peters told Al Jazeera.

[North Korea abruptly stopped importing COVID-19 prevention and control products from China in May 2022, trade data released by Beijing showed, after the country bought face masks and ventilators from its neighbour in previous months.

Daily new cases of fever in North Korea, as reported by its state news agency, KCNA, have been declining since it first acknowledged in mid-May 2022 that it was fighting a COVID-19 outbreak. But it has yet to reveal how many of those cases tested positive for the coronavirus (https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-korea-reports-18820-more-fever-cases-amid-covid-19-outbreak-kcna-2022-06-19/).

North Korea did not import any face masks, thermometers, rubber gloves, ventilators, or vaccines from China in May 2022, according to data released by Chinese customs on Monday (20 Jun 2022). That compared with imports of more than 10.6 million masks, nearly 95 000 thermometers, and 1000 non-invasive ventilators from China in January-April (2022).

South Korea and the United States have offered to provide help, including vaccines, but Pyongyang has not responded.

As Pyongyang has never directly confirmed how many people have tested positive for the virus, WHO said in June (2022) that it assumed the situation was getting worse, not better (https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/n-korea-abruptly-stops-importing-covid-containment-goods-china-2022-06-20/). - Mod.LK]

North Korea has dispatched medical crews and epidemiological investigators to a province battling the outbreak of an intestinal disease, state media reported on [Sun 19 Jun 2022]. At least 800 families suffering from what North Korea has only called an "acute enteric epidemic" have received aid so far in South Hwanghae Province, about 75 miles [121 km] south of the capital Pyongyang. ...officials say it may be cholera or typhoid.

The new outbreak, first reported on [Thu 16 Jun 2022], puts further strain on the isolated country as it battles chronic food shortages and a wave of COVID-19 infections. On [Sun 19 Jun 2022], state news agency KCNA detailed prevention efforts, including quarantines, "intensive screening for all residents," and special treatment and monitoring of vulnerable people such as children and the elderly.

A national "rapid diagnosis and treatment team" is working with local health officials, and measures are being taken to ensure that farming is not disrupted in the key agricultural area, KCNA said. Disinfection work is being carried out, including of sewage and other waste, to ensure the safety of drinking and household water, the report said.

State newspaper Rodong Sinmun on [Fri 17 Jun 2022] said medicines prepared by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and others, including his sister, would be delivered to families in South Hwanghae Province. It is difficult to independently verify North Korea's claims due to a lack of free press in the country.

Ryu Yong Chol, the official in charge of emergency epidemic work in North Korea, warned viewers on state television on [Mon 20 Jun 2022] that enteric diseases could spread through infected people's belongings, food, and drinks. Strictly isolating patients is important to prevent its spread, he said. Apart from typhoid and cholera, the poliovirus, hepatitis A virus, and dysentery bacillus are among the pathogens that cause enteric diseases, Ryu said.

News of the "enteric epidemic" comes as North Korea continues to battle COVID-19, or what it calls "fevered cases". KCNA reported another 19 310 new fever cases on [Sun 19 Jun 2022], without detailing how many of those patients had tested positive for the coronavirus.

Overall, more than 4.6 million have shown fever symptoms since a COVID-19 outbreak was first acknowledged in mid-May [2022]. As of [Sun 19 Jun 2022], 73 "fever" deaths have been reported by KCNA. As with North Korean claims of the "acute enteric epidemic", it is hard to independently verify the case numbers and recoveries reported by North Korean state media.

[3] Variants BA.4 and BA.5
Date: Mon 20 Jun 2022 3:20 a.m. ET

COVID-19 cases are increasing again in the United Kingdom, potentially signaling a future surge in infections in the United States and other countries. A pair of new subvariants of the dominant omicron variant -- BA.4 and BA.5 -- appear to be driving the uptick in cases in the UK. Worryingly, these subvariants seem to partially dodge antibodies from past infection or vaccination, making them more transmissible than other forms of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. There are also some suggestions that the new subvariants have evolved to target the lung, unlike omicron, which usually resulted in a less dangerous infection of the upper respiratory tract.

But there's good news amid the bad. While cases are going up in the UK, hospitalizations and deaths are increasing more slowly or even declining so far. "This could mean higher transmissible variants, BA.4 or 5, are in play, [and] these variants are much less severe," Edwin Michael, an epidemiologist at the Center for Global Health Infectious Disease Research at the University of South Florida, told The Daily Beast.

The trends could change, of course, but the decrease in deaths is an encouraging sign that, 31 months into the pandemic, all that immunity we've built up -- at the cost of half a billion infections and tens of billions of dollars' worth of vaccines -- is still mostly holding.

In the UK COVID-19 cases steadily declined from their recent peak of 89 000 daily new infections in mid-March [2022] until recently. Deaths from the March [2022] wave peaked a month later at around 330 a day (https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk). By early June [2022], cases and deaths were near their pandemic lows. Then came BA.4 and BA.5. The grandchildren of the basic omicron variant that first appeared in the fall of 2021, BA.4 and BA.5 both feature a trio of major mutations to their spike protein, the part of the virus that helps it to grab onto and infect our cells.

Eric Bortz, a University of Alaska-Anchorage virologist and public health expert, described BA.4 and BA.5 as "immunologically distinct sublineages". The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control labeled BA.4 and BA.5 "variants of concerns" in mid-May [2022]. Two weeks later, the 2 new subvariants began the gradual process of overtaking older forms of omicron in the UK. That's when cases began increasing again.

It doesn't help that the UK like most countries -- China is a big exception -- has lifted almost all restrictions on schools, businesses, crowds, and travel. Those restrictions helped to keep down cases but were broadly unpopular and came at a high economic cost. The combination of a fully reopened economy and new COVID-19 subvariants had an immediate effect. The UK Health Security Agency registered 62 228 new infections in the week ending 10 Jun [2022], a 70% uptick over the previous week. COVID-19 hospitalizations grew more slowly over the same period, spiking 30% to 4421.

COVID-19 fatalities dropped, however, sliding 10% to 283. Deaths tend to lag infections by several weeks, of course, so it should come as no surprise if the death rate flattens or rises later this month [June 2022] or early next month [July 2022]. But it may not. BA.4 and BA.5 are more transmissible, owing to that mutated spike protein. But that doesn't mean they're going to kill a lot of people. Despite their unusual qualities, it could be that BA.4 and BA.5 aren't actually more dangerous than previous subvariants.

Bortz sketched out one possibility, that BA.4 and BA.5 are "immune-evasive enough to infect, but generally not evasive enough to counteract acquired immunity from vaccines and/or prior infection." Of course, immunity varies from community to community, country to country. The UK's 67 million people have, for their part, built up substantial immunity over the past 2.5 years. Tens of millions of UK residents have natural antibodies from past infection: 87% of the population is fully vaccinated; 68% is boosted. All those antibodies might not prevent breakthrough infections, but they tend to prevent serious breakthrough infections.

How bad the current surge in cases gets depends to a great extent on the durability of those antibodies. Immunity, whether from past infection or vaccines, tends to wane over time. But how fast it wanes, and to what effect, is unpredictable. It's possible that widespread immunity will hold, and the swelling BA.4 and BA.5 wave in the UK crests in a few weeks without making many more people sick, or killing them. That's the best-case scenario given the lack of political will, and public support, for a new round of restrictions. "If higher cases would not lead to significant disease or deaths, then we may be able to live with this virus," Michael said.

The worst-case scenario is that BA.4 and BA.5 prove more capable of evading our antibodies than experts currently anticipate. Keep an eye on the hospitalization stats. If COVID-19 hospitalizations start increasing in proportion to the growth in cases, it's a sign the new sublineages are dodging our hard-won immunity. In that case, a big spike in deaths would be sure to follow.

That could be a big red flag for the Americas. COVID-19 variants tend to travel from east to west, globally. New variants and subvariants tend to appear in the United States a few weeks after becoming dominant in the UK At present, BA.4 and BA.5 account for just a fifth of new cases in the US. Expect that proportion to increase.

The problem for Americans is that they're much less protected than Britons. Americans have a lot of antibodies from past infection, but they're also a lot less likely to have been vaccinated, and even less likely to be boosted. Just 67% of Americans are fully vaccinated. A little over a third of the US population has had a booster. So if BA.4 and BA.5 end up causing a surge in deaths in the UK, they're likely to inflict an even greater death toll on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean.

["Researchers from China say the new variants [BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/BA.5] might pose an issue for omicron-specific vaccines based on the old BA.1 variant. In a study accepted for publication in the journal Nature this week [15 Jun 2022, see citation below], the researchers wrote that the new variants' immune evasion capabilities require 'immediate investigation'.

"'Importantly, BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/BA.5 display stronger neutralization evasion than BA.2 against the plasma from 3-dose vaccination and, most strikingly, from post-vaccination BA.1 infections,' the study reads. 'Together, our results indicate that omicron may evolve mutations to evade the humoral immunity elicited by BA.1 infection, suggesting that BA.1-derived vaccine boosters may not achieve broad-spectrum protection against new omicron variants.'

"In their study, the researchers isolated hundreds of neutralizing antibodies from BA.1 infections and found that, while these antibodies worked well against BA.1 they were "heavily escaped" by certain mutations, notably, L452Q, which is borne by BA.2.12.1, and L452R and F486V, which are both borne by BA.4 and BA.5" (https://www.newsweek.com/omicron-vaccine-variants-covid-getting-worse-1716950). - Mod.LK

[In the past 24 hours, 13 countries -- France (101 957), Portugal (56 769), Brazil (51 925), the USA (50 007), the UK (36 425), Argentina (28 039), Australia (22 063), North Korea (17 260), Italy (16 905), Japan (12 884), Israel (10 694), and the Netherlands (10 224) -- all reported over 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 1100 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 18 Jun 2022 to late 19 Jun 2022).

A total of 36 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 17 of the 36 countries are from the European region, 7 are from the Americas region, 2 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, 3 are from the South East Asia region, and 1 is from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 25.4%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 15.1%. Comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 10.1% increase in daily reported cases and 2.1% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: Worldwide over 0.55 million newly confirmed infections were reported in the past 24 hours. The cumulative totals for the pandemic stand at over 544.85 million reported cases and over 6.34 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
