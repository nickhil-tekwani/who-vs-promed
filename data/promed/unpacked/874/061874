A rare tickborne disease commonly associated with sleeping in rustic mountain cabins has shown up in caves around Austin, Texas, potentially placing cave workers and the public at risk for infection.

According to researchers, 3 people working in caves in the Austin area were diagnosed with tickborne relapsing fever (TBRF) last year [2017], and 2 more tested positive for antibodies against the _Borrelia_ bacteria that cause the disease.

The infections were identified by Austin Public Health (APH) and occurred mostly in people who had given guided cave tours, according to Stephanie B Campbell, DVM, MPH, CDC Epidemic Intelligence Service officer, and colleagues. Campbell summarized an investigation into the infections during a presentation at the annual EIS [Epidemiological Intelligence Service] conference in Atlanta [16-19 Apr 2018]. She told Infectious Disease News that TBRF has been documented before in Texas caves, though it is unclear whether it has ever been reported in Austin-area caves.

The disease is rare, generally occurring in people who are bitten during the night by _Ornithodoros_ ticks while sleeping in rodent-infested cabins or other rustic buildings where rodents have built nests, according to the CDC. The soft-bodied ticks -- different from hard-body ticks like the ones that cause Lyme disease -- live among rodents, feeding on them as they sleep. Tick and animal species were not collected as part of the investigation, so the report by Campbell and colleagues did not include which ticks may have been involved and what animals they were feeding on. But Campbell said _O. parkeri_ ticks are found in Texas.

In the United States, TBRF is most common in the West, according to the CDC. It has an incubation period of 7 days, followed by a telltale pattern of fever that comes and goes, lasting for roughly 3 days, followed by 7 days without fever, then 3 more days of fever, the CDC explained. Patients who are not treated with antibiotics may experience the process several times. Symptoms also include headache, body aches, nausea, and vomiting. Campbell said the symptomatic patients in the current study were treated with doxycycline.

For their investigation, Campbell and colleagues interviewed and tested the serum of 44 employees doing cave-related work for 8 organizations in 3 Austin area counties. According to Campbell, occupations included guide, biologist, park ranger, natural resource management, and scientist.

A total of 33 participants had entered 89 different caves in the previous 12 months, with the 5 seropositive participants entering significantly more caves than those whose serum was negative, 23.6 vs. 11.7 (P = .04), Campbell and colleagues reported. 4 of the seropositive employees gave tours.

Campbell and colleagues preliminarily identified 5 caves that were most frequently entered -- many of them in public use and open for tours -- and categorized them as potentially high-risk for TBRF.

An article written by the researchers that outlines key TBRF information and facts for healthcare provider awareness will be published soon in Travis County Medical Society Journal, Campbell said. The researchers are also working to develop prevention recommendations for people who work in caves and tour groups.

"In our investigation, we asked about prevention methods that had been previously used, including long clothing, repellents, and permethrin. We found no differences in prevention use between cavers who were seropositive and those who were seronegative for TBRF," Campbell said. "Because this was a small sample size, further research would be helpful to understand the impacts of prevention measures."

[Relapsing fever is a bacterial infection caused by certain species of the spirochete _Borrelia_. These organisms are able to periodically change their surface protein molecules to evade the host's immune response, thus causing a relapsing illness. Following an incubation period of about 7 days, the illness is characterized by recurring episodes of high fever, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea, and vomiting, each episode lasting several days, followed by a several-day asymptomatic interval.

Complications may include involvement of the lungs (ARDS, acute respiratory distress syndrome), central nervous system, spinal cord, eyes, heart, and liver. The bacteremia is intense (more than 10 000 organisms per ml of blood) during febrile episodes, which allows detection of organisms on a Wright-Giemsa stained blood smear. Thick blood smears are more sensitive than thin smears.

Relapsing fever can be transmitted by ticks or lice. Louse-borne relapsing fever (LBRF) is more severe than tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF), with case-fatality rates without antimicrobial treatment of 30 to 70 percent in outbreaks. LBRF is caused by a single _Borrelia_ species, _B. recurrentis_, transmitted through abraded skin when the body louse is crushed during scratching. Humans are the only host of _B. recurrentis_. LBRF is endemic in Ethiopia, Sudan, Eritrea, and Somalia. Outbreaks are found in developing regions affected by war and in refugee camps characterized by overcrowding and poor personal hygiene. Sporadic cases of LBRF have also been seen in Europe in asylum seekers from the horn of Africa.

Soft bodied or hard bodied ticks can transmit TBRF. In the western United States, TBRF is usually associated with sleeping in rustic, rodent-infested cabins in mountainous areas and is caused by several _Borrelia_ species, _Borrelia hermsii_, _B. parkerii_, and _B. turicatae_, which are transmitted by the bite of soft-bodied ticks (genus _Ornithodoros_). Each tick species is associated with a specific species of _Borrelia_. For instance, _B. hermsii_ is transmitted by _O. hermsi_ ticks, _B. parkerii_ by _O. parkeri_ ticks, and _B. turicatae_ by _O. turicata_ ticks. Soft bodied ticks live in rodent burrows and feed on rodents at night. The bite of soft ticks is painless and lasts less than half an hour. Most people are unaware that they have been bitten.

_B. miyamotoi_, found in hard-bodied ticks (_Ixodes_) in regions where Lyme disease is endemic, also causes a relapsing fever-like illness.

Treatment of relapsing fever consists of either a tetracycline (such as doxycycline), a macrolide (such as erythromycin), penicillin, or other beta-lactam antibiotics (such as ceftriaxone). LBRF can be treated effectively with a single dose of the antibiotic (http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/137/5/573), whereas treatment of TBRF requires 7-10 days to prevent relapse. When initiating antibiotic therapy, all patients should be observed for a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. The reaction, caused by massive release of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and other cytokines, is manifest by a worsening of symptoms with rigors, tachycardia, sweating, hypotension, and high fever, occurs in over 50 percent of cases.

ProMED-mail previously posted a report of a case of culture-confirmed TBRF caused by _B. turicatae_ acquired by a soldier during a military training exercise in Texas, USA (Tick-borne relapsing fever - USA: (TX) 2015 20170502.5008476).

The city of Austin is the seat of Travis county and also the capital of the state of Texas in the South Central United States. Travis county, with a population of about 1.1 million people in 2014, is located in south central Texas; it can be seen on the map at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_County,_Texas.
