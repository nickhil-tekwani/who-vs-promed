Though the cases of chikungunya in other districts are plummeting,
the disease is spreading fast in Belgaum district.
As many as 230 people in the district are said to be suffering from
chikungunya. The disease has been identified in the villages of
Ramdurg, Bailhongal, Gokak, Khanapur, Chikkodi and Athani taluks of
the district.
The first case of chikungunya in the district was detected at Telsang
village, with an additional 25 cases. However, the disease was
controlled with the efforts of the medical teams that were sent to
Telsang from Belgaum.
Dr P A Pattanshetti, District Health Officer, said the disease was
under control and the administration had taken necessary steps to
check its spread. He said that a team of doctors was sent to villages
that had reported the disease.
He clarified that the disease was caused with the bite of the
[_Aedes_] mosquito. "These mosquitoes bite only during the day," he
said. "The mosquitoes are born in stagnant water."
Dr Pattanshetti said that as the rainy season had started in the
district, risk of the spread of waterborne diseases increased
tremendously. He advised people to drink boiled water.

It appears that the self-limiting disease chikungunya may have
reached Chennai, though confirmation is awaited from the National
Institute of Virology, Pune.
Two weeks ago, the health department of the Chennai Corporation
collected blood samples from 20 persons at Old Washermanpet and
Korukkupet, based on information from a retired Corporation doctor in
the area. Since then, scattered reports of suspected chikungunya
cases have been reported from Park Town, Purasawakkam, Saidapet,
Vyasarpadi and Mylapore, though Corporation health posts have not
recorded the disease.
The 20 patients whose blood samples were taken have been categorised
as "Acutely ill" and "convalescing." Verification by health
department officials has revealed that some patients had visited
Tirupati, where an outbreak was reported recently. Other cases have
also been reported from areas with people who have been to Tirupati,
Corporation Health department officials said.
Chikungunya was officially reported in India around November 2005,
said C. Nagaraj, Research Officer, Regional Office for Health and
Family Welfare, Government of India. Characterised by high fever and
headaches, the disease is marked for severe joint aches, which
persist for about a month.
The word "Chikungunya" itself comes from Swahili for "bent"
describing the posture of an affected person.
Spread by the same mosquito that causes dengue, _Aedes aegypti_, it
is said to be a self-limiting disease with nearly nil mortality,
unlike dengue. However, chikungunya, which can be detected by a blood
test, is said to be debilitating and has no specific course of
treatment. Only the symptoms are treated. The same precautions taken
to prevent dengue are advocated to keep chikungunya at bay too:
cleaning water containers frequently and preventing stagnation of
fresh water, said the Corporation Vector Control Officer.
Civic authorities too must spruce up their vector control programmes.
The issue was highlighted at the Chennai Corporation Council meeting
on Tuesday when one of the councillors, P. Ullaselvan of the DMK,
said the disease was spreading in North Chennai. Corporation Health
Department officials, meanwhile, await confirmation from Pune to
launch large-scale awareness campaigns.
