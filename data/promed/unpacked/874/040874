Globally, influenza activity remained low, with the exception of some Pacific Islands.

- In North America, influenza activity continued to increase.
- In Europe overall influenza activity increased slightly but remained low.
- In tropical countries of the Americas, influenza detections remained low, with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causing most influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infections (SARI).
- In Africa and western Asia, influenza activity was low.
- In eastern Asia, influenza activity in most countries remained low.
- In tropical Asia, influenza activity was low with influenza B predominant in Viet Nam.
- In the southern hemisphere, influenza activity remained low except in several Pacific Islands, where ILI activity remained high.
- The review of the southern hemisphere influenza season has been published at the WHO website: http://www.who.int/wer/2014/wer8948/en/.
- Based on FluNet reporting (as of 27 Nov 2014, 14:25 UTC), during weeks 45 to 46 (2 Nov 2014 to 15 Nov 2014), National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 45 countries, areas or territories reported data. The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 34 452 specimens. 2572 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 2123 (82.5 percent) were typed as influenza A and 449 (17.5 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 27 (2.9 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 917 (97.0 percent) were influenza A(H3N2) and one (0.1 percent) was influenza A(H5). Of the characterized B viruses, 34 (94.4 percent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 2 (5.6 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

Note: Global epidemiology and surveillance updates are periodically collected from data reported by national authorities or organizations responsible for reporting this data.

Countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere
-----------------------------------
North America
In the countries in North America, overall influenza activity continued increasing slightly. Influenza A(H3N2) virus was predominant.

In Canada, influenza-like illness (ILI) activity has been above the historical average for the last 11 weeks, and increased to 41.1 consultations per 1000. Influenza detections increased sharply to 4.6 percent positivity (compared to 2 percent in the previous update). Detections of RSV and adenovirus also increased, following seasonal patterns; detections of parainfluenza and rhinovirus have decreased. Of the laboratory confirmed influenza detections, 88 percent were influenza A, with influenza A(H3N2) predominating. Approximately half of the detections occurred in patients aged over 65 years. Of 29 influenza-associated pediatric hospitalizations reported through 15 Nov 2014, the majority (66 percent) were due to influenza A(H3N2). Surveillance of influenza-associated adult hospitalizations has not begun yet for the 2014-2015 season.

In the United States of America, influenza activity continued to increase (9.3 percent positivity) but was within expected levels for this time of year. ILI activity remained below the national baseline. Since mid-August 2014, 1116 laboratory confirmed cases of respiratory illness have been attributed to enterovirus D68. Of 955 influenza positive specimens, 87.5 percent were influenza A (mainly influenza A(H3N2)), and 12.5 percent were influenza B.

In Mexico, acute respiratory infections (ARI) activity increased slightly but remained consistent with seasonal patterns, while influenza activity remained low.

Europe
In Europe, influenza activity was low, and there was no indication that the influenza season has begun. From 35 countries in the European region, 2 percent of 634 sentinel specimens and one percent of 5851 non-sentinel specimens tested positive for influenza virus. Of the non-sentinel influenza positive specimens, 65 percent were influenza A (of which 78 percent were influenza A(H3N2)) and 35 percent were influenza B. Three countries reported a total of 17 influenza-associated hospitalizations, 13 of which were admitted to intensive care units. Of these, 10 were positive for influenza A, and 3 were influenza B.

Northern Africa and the Western and Central Asia region
In northern Africa and the western and central Asia regions, influenza detections remained at inter-seasonal levels.

Eastern Asia
In the eastern Asian region, influenza activity remained low.

In northern China, influenza activity increased slightly and was mainly due to influenza A(H3N2). In Japan and the Republic of Korea, influenza activity remained at inter-seasonal levels. In Mongolia, ILI activity increased with no indication of increased laboratory confirmed influenza detection.

Countries in the tropical zone
-----------------------------
Tropical countries of the Americas/Central America and the Caribbean
Overall in this region, influenza activity was variable. Circulation of influenza A(H3N2) virus was reported from several of the Caribbean and central American countries, such as Costa Rica, Cuba and Nicaragua, following an earlier period of activity predominated by influenza B. However, in most central American countries, circulation of influenza has decreased over the recent weeks. In Cuba, severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) associated hospitalizations were high due mainly to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), but influenza detections also increased. In Costa Rica, both RSV and influenza A(H3N2) detections increased.

Tropical countries in South America reported ILI SARI activity within the expected range for this time of the year. RSV continued to circulate but with decreasing trends. In Colombia, influenza activity was ongoing, with influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B predominating.

In Brazil, activity decreased, and influenza B was the most commonly detected influenza virus.

Central African tropical region
In Africa, influenza activity reported from most countries in eastern, middle and western Africa was at low levels. In Madagascar, influenza activity was caused by both influenza A and influenza B viruses.

Tropical Asia
In most southern Asian and Southeastern Asian countries, activity declined or remained low. In Viet Nam, activity decreased and was predominantly caused by influenza B viruses.

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
-----------------------------
Temperate Zone of South America
In the temperate zone of South America, influenza activity remained at inter-seasonal levels.

South Africa
In South Africa, ILI and SARI activity remained at inter-seasonal levels, with influenza A(H3N2) predominating among positive ILI samples.

Oceania, Melanesia and Polynesia
In Australia and New Zealand, influenza activity remained low.

In the Pacific Islands, ILI activity was variable; high activity was reported in American Samoa, the Federated States of Micronesia, French Polynesia, Guam, the Marshall Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu.

[The seasonal influenza season remains largely unchanged, with so far virtually no upsurge in the number and little change in cases of the antigenic types of influenza now in circulation. So far, no novel viruses have been recorded anywhere in the world. The vaccine being administered currently should contain the extent of a seasonal winter epidemic.
