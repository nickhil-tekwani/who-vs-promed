Further reports of H5N8 avian flu outbreaks have been sent to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) from a number of European countries in the past week [week 16 to 22 Jan 2017].

France detailed 6 new cases in wild birds in the past week [week 16 to 22 Jan 2017], and also 34 separate outbreaks in poultry. Many of the poultry farm outbreaks were found through clinical symptoms, but others were detected as part of France's prevention measures, which involves pre-emptive culling of birds in some regions. Overall, over 52 000 birds were destroyed on farms and over 2000 died.

In Germany, 5 new outbreaks were announced affecting farms of turkeys, ducks or mixed poultry in Lower Saxony, Brandenburg and North Rhine-Westphalia. A zoo in Saxony-Anhalt and a backyard holding in Bavaria were also affected. Over 68 000 birds were destroyed and 673 were killed in these outbreaks. Neighbouring Netherlands found large numbers of wild ducks with the disease in Utrecht.

Poland found 2 new outbreaks on farms and 2 in backyard holdings, in several different regions. Over 4000 birds died as a result of these outbreaks. In Ukraine, a farm in the Odessa region and a backyard holding in Chernovtsy suffered outbreaks, with over 10 000 birds killed.

Croatia reported new outbreaks of avian flu on a farm in Zagrebacka, where 40 birds died, as well as in a number of wild birds in other areas. Nearby Serbia reported 1 dead wild buzzard, while the Czech Republic reported several mute swans and 1 backyard holding in Jihocesky as affected by the disease. Slovakia found 2 new outbreaks in backyard holdings in Presov and Trnava as well as some affected wild birds. In Romania, several swans were found with the disease, and 1 backyard farm of 46 birds was also affected.

One new outbreak was reported last week by Greece, where avian flu hit caged layers in Peloponnisos region, with 28 000 birds destroyed.

A total of 3 farms were affected by avian flu in south-western parts of Russia, where 2530 birds died and over 219 000 were culled to prevent the disease from spreading. Two affected swans were also reported by Russia.

Bird flu has been found in a flock of pheasants at a farm in Lancashire, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has confirmed.

The UK's chief veterinary officer said H5N8 avian flu has been discovered in the breeding pheasants in Preston.

Public Health England (PHE) said the risk to humans was "very low". A 1.8 mi (approx. 3 km) protection zone has been set up around the farm. Defra said a number of the 10 000 birds in the flock died with the rest culled. A full investigation is under way to determine the source of the infection, said Defra.

The Food Standards Agency said it was clear bird flu does not pose a food safety risk for UK consumers.

There have been a number of outbreaks of the virus including 1 at a farm in Louth, Lincolnshire in December [2016]. Earlier that month, poultry keepers were told to keep their birds inside for 30 days to protect them from a highly-infectious strain of avian flu in Europe.

[On 22 Jan 2017, Slovakia reported to the OIE 15 new HPAI H5N8 "outbreaks" in wild birds, most of them in western regions bordering Austria and Hungary. For details, including the identity of the 10 species involved and a map, see http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=22479.

Italy reported on 23 Jan 2017 its 1st poultry-affecting HPAI H5N8 outbreak, recorded in the Veneto region (see 20170124.4787128). A map is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=22506.

On 24 Jan 2017, Slovenia reported 3 new HPAI H5N8 cases/outbreaks in mute swans, in 3 locations distributed in its north-eastern region; see, with map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=22456.

According to the tables available in the useful French web-site "Plateforme-ESA", the numbers of HPAI H5N8 outbreaks reported in EU-related countries as of 23 Jan 2017 is the following: Poultry - 542 outbreaks in 16 countries; wild birds - 525 "outbreaks" (in fact, cases) in 23 countries; captive birds - 16 "outbreaks" in 7 countries. The virus, according to the said source, has been recently circulating in avians in 23 European countries. For their identity and additional data, please refer to http://plateforme-esa.fr/article/situation-%C3%A9pid%C3%A9miologique-iahp-en-europe-depuis-octobre-2016-point-de-situation-au-23012017. An HPAI H5N8 interactive map, updated 22 Jan 2017, is available at http://plateforme-esa.fr/carte-interactive-de-suivi-des-foyers-et-cas-diahp.

The HPAI H5N8 virus has also continued its spread within Israel. On 23 Jan 2017, follow-up report No 4 was submitted to the OIE, notifying 3 new outbreaks affecting commercial turkey farms. See, with map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=22456. This brings the total number of outbreaks in Israel since the start of epizootic there, reportedly on 9 Nov 2016, to a total of 24 outbreaks, affecting commercial poultry farms (chickens and turkey) as well as several species of wild birds. We are informed today (25 Jan 2017) about an additional outbreak. This has become Israel's largest registered HPAI event.

The virus has been reported to affect poultry in other countries in the Middle East, namely Iran (14 reported outbreaks, map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=21618), Egypt (2 reported outbreaks, map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=21730), and Kuwait (1 outbreak, map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=22481). No reports from other countries in the region, which is situated on the flyway of migratory birds between Europe and Africa, have become available so far.

The virus is expected to continue its circulation in the eastern hemisphere during the rest of the winter months (northern to the Equator). Will it survive the summer and become endemic (in waterfowl?), returning next fall? - A crucial question. - Mod.AS
