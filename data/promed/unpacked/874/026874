The NPPO [National Plant Protection Organisation] of Portugal recently informed EPPO of the first detections of _Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus_ (Begomovirus, ToLCNDV - EPPO Alert List) on its territory. In July 2019, during an official survey, ToLCNDV was detected in one plant of _Cucurbita pepo_ (cv. Brilhante) in a greenhouse located in the Algarve region [Faro district].

ToLCNDV was also detected in a greenhouse in the Azores (Sao Miguel Island) in plants of _C. pepo_. About 20% of _C. pepo_ plants showed symptoms. Other hosts did not show any symptoms. Leaf samples were collected from symptomatic _C. pepo_ and tested positive for ToLCNDV. Phytosanitary measures aiming at eradication will be taken in both cases.

[_Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus_ (ToLCNDV; genus _Begomovirus_) has been reported to cause severe yield losses on tomato and watermelon crops on the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the tomato leaf curl and yellow leaf curl clades of the genus. Known species in these clades cause similar diseases on solanaceous and other crops and are considered to be the biggest constraint to solanaceous and cucurbit crops, both in terms of yield losses (up to 100 percent in tomato) and loss of fruit quality.

Begomoviruses are transmitted by different whitefly vectors (such as _Bemisia tabaci_ biotypes), and many can also be transmitted by mechanical means and grafting, but they are not seed transmitted. Whiteflies in themselves are serious pests of many vegetable crops. If virus sources are available locally, high vector numbers are often reflected in high levels of the viral diseases they transmit. Begomovirus control is particularly difficult in open field crops due to the widespread presence and wide host range of whiteflies. Disease management may include pathogen exclusion, vector control, as well as elimination of possible pathogen and/or vector reservoir plants. In some cases, crop cultivars with increased virus resistance are available.

ToLCNDV was limited to Asia until it was reported from Europe for the 1st time in 2013 on cucurbits in Spain (ProMED-mail post 20131223.2131729). It has since also been reported from several other countries in the Mediterranean region. The source of the Mediterranean incursion so far remains unknown.

Novel viruses have been shown to emerge from recombination events during co-infections of ToLCNDV and other begomoviruses (see links below). Such new viruses have, for example, been identified in the Mediterranean region causing the severe damage to cucurbit crops, but poorly infecting tomatoes; and recently in Indonesia, as recombinant with _Squash leaf curl China virus_ (SLCCNV) which on its own has a restricted cucurbit host range, infecting squash and pumpkin, but not melon or cucumber. The new recombinant viruses are often more aggressive and have a widened host range, compared to each of the partners, and so pose an increased risk to solanaceous and cucurbit crops worldwide.
