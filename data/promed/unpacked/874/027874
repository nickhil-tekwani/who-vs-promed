A patient with falciparum malaria was seen in Bern. A 44-year-old
Swiss male traveled to Goa for 14 days and returned on 29 Dec 2008.
He received no prophylaxis or pre-travel counseling.

The patient was admitted at Bern with fever upon return and was
hospitalized on 2 Jan 2009 with parasitemia of 5.1 percent, which
increased to 7.1 percent on 3 Jan 2009. There was no organ failure.

Initial therapy was with quinine/doxycycline, which after 3 days was
changed to artemether/lumefantrine. There was parasite clearance at
day 6 and no complications.

[Reports of _P. falciparum_ malaria in visitors to Goa have appeared
at regular intervals since autumn 2006. The Swiss traveler had not
taken prophylaxis. We do not know whether the British traveler took
prophylaxis. The steady trickle of patients back to Europe shows that
malaria transmission is still ongoing in and around Goa and
emphasizes that local malaria control programs are not working and
that travelers still need chemoprophylaxis when visiting Goa.

Goa is on the west coast. Kerala in southwestern India can be located
