Viet Nam: a new confirmed case and a suspected case of avian influenza
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A 21 year old man from Viet Nam's northern Thai Binh province has just been
confirmed as having contracted avian influenza (H5N1) virus infection,
while his younger sister is suspected also of being infected with the
virus, the local newspaper Youth reported on Fri 25 Feb 2005.
Initial testing on Thu 24 Feb 2005 showed that samples from the young man
from Thai Thuy district, who was admitted to the Tropical Disease Institute
in Hanoi on 22 Feb 2005 after exhibiting a high temperature, tested
positive for the virus. The paper quoted Pham Van Diu, director of the Thai
Binh Preventive Medicine Center. The young man is having difficulty in
breathing, the Director said, adding that the patient's 14 year old sister
is now under treatment at the Thai Binh Hospital, since she has a fever and
is suspected of having contracted avian influenza (H5N1) virus infection.
The young man is the 3rd case of bird flu infection detected in Thai Binh
so far in 2005. In January 2005, 2 brothers from the province were found to
be infected with H5N1 virus, one of whom died, and the other has fully
recovered. The 2 brothers ate a dish made from raw duck's blood at a local
market before exhibiting symptoms of avian influenza.
Viet Nam has so far experienced 3 outbreaks of bird flu in humans, killing
32 local people. In the 1st outbreak, lasting from 26 Dec 2003 to 10 Mar
2004, a total of 23 people were infected with H5N1 virus, of whom 16 died.
In the 2nd outbreak from 19 Jul 2004 to 26 Aug 2004, 4 people contracted
the virus, and all of them died. In the most recent outbreak starting 16
Dec 2004, Viet Nam has identified 18 local cases of avian influenza H5N1
virus infection, of whom 12 have died, 5 have fully recovered, and one
remains hospitalized.
Avian influenza, which has killed or led to the forced culling of more than
1.5 million fowl in its 35 cities and provinces since January 2005, is
cooling down. A dozen localities have detected no new bird flu-affected
spots in their territories for at least 3 weeks, according to Viet Nam's
Department of Animal Health.
