The following response to previous postings regarding anthrax vaccine and
immunization of military personnel is from Lt. General Ronald Blanck, The
Surgeon General, U.S. Army.

Anthrax Vaccine Safety and Efficacy Issues Raised by ProMED-mail
Background: ProMED-mail published an article by Dr. Meryl Nass, 2 Jan 98,
raising concerns about limited data on the safety and efficacy of anthrax
vaccine. The article relied on only published data, which is very limited.
Over the years, additional data has been submitted to the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA), which is responsible for review of this information
and licensure of the product.
The Vaccine: Potency and safety of each lot of vaccine are determined by
laboratory and animal tests according to FDA regulations. Results of these
tests must be reviewed by FDA before the vaccine can be released for use.
Safety: Clinical studies involving 16,500 doses were submitted to the FDA
and
reviewed for licensure of the vaccine in 1970. Mild local reactions (redness
less than one inch in diameter and slight tenderness) were reported for 5%
to 10% of the initial series doses, and 3% to 16% of the booster doses.
Moderate local reactions (redness of one to two inches in diameter with
itching and tenderness) were reported for less than 1% to 3% of all doses
administered. Severe local reactions (marked tenderness or limitation of arm
motion) were reported for 1% or less of the doses given in any study during
the 5-year period prior to licensure. There were four systemic reactions
reported: two persons with chills and fever, one with fever, and one with
general body aches for 24 hours.
>From 1977 to 1996, there was [a monitoring of 3,679 primary series doses
and 5,799 booster doses. Reactions were reported to be about 4% for both
primary and booster doses.
Efficacy: As stated in the ProMED-mail article, only one human efficacy
study was performed -- in wool mill workers, the only study population
available. There were 21 cases of cutaneous anthrax, with only one in a
vaccinated worker.
There were five cases of inhalation anthrax in the unvaccinated group, four
of
them being fatal, and no cases of inhalation anthrax in the vaccinated
group.
The reduction in the number of cases of cutaneous anthrax in the vaccinated
group when compared to the number of cutaneous cases in unvaccinated workers
was
considered a sufficient demonstration of vaccine efficacy. The five cases of
inhalation anthrax were not enough to provide the statistical significance
necessary for an explicit indication for inhalation anthrax. The anthrax
vaccine package insert does not specify the route of infection against which
the
vaccine is effective.
The Centers for Disease Control recorded 27 additional cutaneous cases of
anthrax from 1962 to 1974; 24 of these cases were in unvaccinated
individuals, and the remaining three cases were in partially immunized
individuals. And FDA Advisory Panel reviewed this data in 1985 and concluded
that no cases occurred in fully vaccinated subjects even though the risk of
infection was present.
The Committee on Infectious Diseases, American Academy of Pediatrics (1994),
states that "the vaccine is effective in preventing or significantly
reducing the occurrence of cutaneous and inhalation anthrax in adults."
Because target populations with an incidence of inhalation anthrax cannot be
identified, further evidence of efficacy of the anthrax vaccine against
inhalation anthrax can only be gained from aerosol challenge of immunized
animals. As Dr. Nass states in the ProMED-mail message, survival rates in
immunized guinea pigs against spores of the virulent Ames strain of
_Bacillus anthracis_ does not "engender enthusiasm" about the anthrax
vaccine. The anthrax vaccine, however, is very effective against inhalation
anthrax in the rhesus monkey, a model that most closely resembles human
anthrax infection.
Several studies performed at the United States Army Medical Research
Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) demonstrated the efficacy of the
anthrax vaccine against inhalation anthrax in the monkey model. Rhesus
monkeys were vaccinated with one or two doses of the anthrax vaccine and
then challenged with highly lethal levels of spores from the Ames strain of
anthrax, the most virulent strain that we have tested. In all these studies,
the anthrax vaccine protected 42 of 43 rhesus monkeys against inhalation
anthrax:
[1 25 of 25 monkeys vaccinated with two doses of anthrax vaccine survived a
lethal aerosol challenge at 8 to 38 weeks after vaccination.
[2 7 of 8 monkeys survived a lethal aerosol challenge almost 2 years after
receiving the two doses of vaccine.
[3 10 of 10 monkeys survived a lethal aerosol challenge 6 weeks after only
one
dose of vaccine.
DoD addressed the effectiveness of Anthrax vaccine for prevention of
inhalation anthrax with the FDA. In their reply, the FDA concluded that the
DOD interpretation of the scope of the Anthrax vaccine license to include
protection against inhalation exposure is not inconsistent with the current
label.
Safety of the Vaccine in Relation to Persian Gulf Illness: The Institute of
Medicine (1995) considered the information on anthrax vaccine as well as
other vaccines administered to military personnel and concluded that there
was no evidence that vaccines in general cause the non-specific complaints
associated with service during Operation Desert Storm. The Presidential
Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veteran's Illnesses (1996) concluded that it
is unlikely that health effects reported by Gulf War veterans today are the
result of the anthrax vaccine used alone or in combination with the
botulinum toxoid vaccine.
Safety of Multiple Vaccinations in Relation to Persian Gulf Illness: The
Presidential Advisory Committee also considered the health effects of
receiving multiple vaccines. The Committee wrote: "The human immune system
has evolved the capability to deal with thousands of foreign substances, to
sort them out, and to regulate the immune response. Individual vaccines can
cause adverse effects, but several studies of the effects of giving multiple
vaccinations at one time have found no adverse effects associated with the
practice." In addition, the Committee on Infectious Diseases, American
Academy of Pediatrics (1994) stated that most vaccines can be safely
administered simultaneously, and that there are no contraindications known
for the safe simultaneous administration of multiple vaccines routinely
recommended for infants and children. Laboratory workers from the former US
Army Medical Unit were administered multiple investigational vaccines as
part of a safety program to protect them from potential laboratory accidents
with infectious agents. The published reports of those studies in 1956,
1962, and 1972 found no evidence of long term adverse effects resulting from
the repeated immunizations. Multiple immunizations continue to be
administered to at-risk laboratory workers and there have been no clinically
significant adverse events up to the present time.
Conclusion: The anthrax vaccine is safe for humans. Efficacy has been
demonstrated in wool mill workers against cutaneous anthrax, and the studies
in Rhesus monkeys indicate that the vaccine should protect humans against
high lethal-exposure doses of Bacillus anthracis spores by the aerosol route.
