Re: ProMED-mail "Newcastle disease, avian - Chile"
--------------------------------------------------
From our previous experience and data from sampling thousands of sea
birds for more than a decade along the Atlantic coast of Patagonia
and the Pacific coast in Peru, as well as previous outbreaks reported
in the literature for the US and Canada, finding PMV-1 in the dead
adult cormorants could well be an incidental finding and not
necessarily the cause of these deaths.
We've seen over 90 percent serological prevalence in a variety of
cormorant species in some years, with no signs of disease or
mortality in adults. Mortality events in cormorants are typically
associated with nestlings or fledglings (young of the year). On some
occasions we have seen mortality in other species sharing cormorant
habitat such as the die-offs of penguins in the austral summer of
2000-2001 in Argentina at the same time as a peak in seroprevalence
of PMV-1 in imperial cormorants (_Phalacrocorax albiventer_) and rock
shags (_Ph. Magellanicus_). Paramyxovirus (PMV-1) and/or PMV-1
antibodies are commonly found in adult cormorants in different parts
of the world, and evidence of exposure to other paramyxoviruses, such
as PMV-2 and PMV-3, are also frequent findings in various cormorant
and other sea bird species.
As the moderator stated, contact between wild cormorants and domestic
poultry should be extremely rare to non-existent in properly managed
operations.
