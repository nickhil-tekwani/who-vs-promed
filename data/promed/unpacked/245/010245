Hiroshima prefecture announced on [16 Oct 2019] that 2 women in their 80s and 90s in Mihara City died from a tick-borne infection, severe febrile thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS). The number of deaths in the prefecture is 9 since SFTS was subject to notification in 2013 under the Infectious Disease Law.

According to the prefectural health measures section, a woman in her 90s was diagnosed with SFTS on 8 Oct [2019] and a woman in her 80s on 12 Oct [2019]. Both died on 15 Oct [2019].

SFTS is transmitted by being bitten by ticks. After an incubation period of 6 days to 2 weeks, symptoms such as fever appear. It does not infect people from person to person. Ticks are said to be active from spring to autumn, and the lesson is to "refrain from exposing the skin when working outdoors."

Severe fever with. thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) in Japan, as of June 2019. IASR [Infectious Agents Surveillance Report]. 2019; 40(7) (no. 473): 111-112.

SFTS cases notified under the NESID system

A total of 402 SFTS cases were notified to the National Epidemiological Surveillance of Infectious Diseases (NESID) system between 4 Mar 2013 and 31 Mar 2019 (Table), including 8 cases of onset before 2012 (2 cases in 2005, 1 case in 2010, and 5 cases in 2012). The occurrence increased between May and October each year (Fig. 1), and cases have been notified from 23 prefectures, mainly in western Japan (Fig. 2). One case was notified from Tokyo in May 2019, but the suspected area of infection was Nagasaki prefecture (see p. 114 of this issue). The patients comprised 196 (49%) males and 206 (51%) females (Fig. 3), with the majority being over 60 years old (range: age 5-96; median: age 74). Symptoms in 394 patients with onset after 2013 included fever in 392 (99%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and anorexia) in 342 (87%), and blood tests confirmed thrombocytopenia and leukopenia in 380 (96%) and 351 (89%) patients, respectively.

Epidemiology of SFTS

The AMED (Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development) research group, "research on the development of diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome, and on the elucidation of infection risk to humans," analyzed the epidemiology, clinical information, and prognostic risk factors of SFTS based on detailed patient information in 133 cases. Comorbidities were observed in 97 (73%), including hypertension (47 cases, 35%), diabetes mellitus (27 cases, 20%), dyslipidemia (15 cases, 11%), and malignant tumors (9 cases, 7%). There were many malignancies in patients who died. A total of 109 patients (82%) performed outdoor activities within 2 weeks before onset, among whom 70 (53%) were farmers. The case fatality rate (CFR) during the study period was 27% (36 deaths), and there was no significant change in CFR from year to year (see p. 113 of this issue).

Laboratory diagnosis in Japan

Prefectural and municipal public health institutes (PHIs) throughout Japan conduct the SFTSV gene detection test by conventional one-step RT-PCR. The National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) conducts gene amplification tests by quantitative one-step RT-PCR and antibody detection tests against SFTSV using paired sera, upon request.

SFTSV antibody positivity among residents living in SFTS-endemic regions in Japan

The antibody-positive rate survey is carried out for residents of regions with many SFTS reports in Japan. In Ehime prefecture, SFTSV antibody tests were conducted on 694 subjects (319 males and 375 females) who were considered to be high-risk groups for SFTS, aged 50 years old or older, and engaged in agriculture and forestry in SFTS-endemic areas. Only one subject (0.14%) was SFTSV-antibody positive. A similar survey was also conducted in the endemic areas in Kagoshima prefecture, and among 646 subjects, 2 (0.3%) were SFTSV antibody positive. Although the antibody positivity among the inhabitants in these endemic areas was not high, further investigations are necessary (see p. 119 of this issue).

[The above cases in [1] above add 2 to the number for 2019 in Japan. The total number of SFTS cases nationally for this year (2019) is not given. There were cases every year from 2013 to 2018 (see item [2], above), but more cases occurred in 2017 and 2018. Cases were widely disbursed geographically in 2018, with 24 prefectures reporting infected individuals. It appears that SFTS virus is endemic in several areas, and the best way to avoid infection would be to avoid tick bites.

SFTS is a serious disease and of significant public health concern. Although SFTS virus infections may be serious, there is evidence for subclinical or mild infections as well, so the previous numbers may be an underestimate of the total number of infections. There is also some evidence for person-to-person direct transmission of the virus, but that appears to be a rare event. The virus is doubtless endemic in several countries in Asia, and cases have occurred previously in Japan. Apparently, there are 2 previously reported affected individuals who acquired their infections directly from an SFTS virus-infected cat. No mention was made of tick transmission in that instance. The possible route of transmission from the cat to the veterinarian and veterinary nurse via exposure to blood or other bodily fluids is not mentioned (see Severe fever w/ thrombocytopenia synd. - East Asia (02): Japan (MZ) 20181211.6204927).

SFTS virus is a tick-transmitted phlebovirus in the Bunyavirus family. Images of a _Haemaphysalis longicornis_ tick, the SFTS vector, can be seen at http://www.lowchensaustralia.com/pests/paralysis-tick/haemaphysalis-longicornis-description.htm. - Mod.TY
