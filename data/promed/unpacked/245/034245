2001/054 Molecular characterization of Citrus mosaic badnavirus
---------------------------------------------
The genome (dsDNA) of Citrus mosaic badnavirus (EPPO A1 quarantine pest),
which causes a common citrus disease in India, has been completely
sequenced. This information will be useful to study relationships between
Citrus mosaic badnavirus and other badnaviruses, genetic variability within
CYMV, and to develop diagnostic tools.

[Little is known about this virus, and thus sequencing of the genome is a
significant advance in our knowledge. Viruses in the genus Badnavirus,
family Caulimoviridae, are also pararetroviruses, which means that they
replicate via an RNA intermediate. The type species is Commelina yellow
mottle (ComYMV). Badnaviruses occur worldwide, primarily in tropical and
sub-tropical climes. The most common symptom is interveinal chlorotic
mottling, which occurs after infection, but symptoms may gradually
disappear. There are at least 10 definitive species in the genus and 4
tentative ones. Banana streak, Cacao swollen shoot, Rice tungro and
Sugarcane bacilliform badnaviruses are major pathogens of food crops. A
good description of badnaviruses and pararetroviruses can be obtained at:
