On 6 Jan 2000 a case of yellow fever (YF) was confirmed in a 25-year-old
female from Niquelandia, north Goias state, who survived. Onset was in
December 1999.
The National Health Foundation (Funasa) notified 66 cases in 1999,
including: 31 cases from Marajo Island, Para state; 4 in Goias; & 2 fatal
cases in Amerindians who died in the Federal District but caught the disease
in Mato Grosso state. Funasa estimates that an average of 130 cases occur
annually [but see Mod. comment at end.
Jarbas Passarinho, director of the National Epidemiology Center of Funasa,
said "Everybody resident in the regions of the North, Central-West & the
east of Maranhao state, which are considered to be (YF) endemic areas,
should be vaccinated every 10 years." In the last 2 years 25 million
people have been vaccinated in Brazil, which holds a stock of 43 million
doses. Beginning in 1999 the vaccination program for childhood diseases
has included YF vaccine.

[A search of the WHO WER for 1999 shows a report of 21 May of 18 YF cases
with 3 deaths. The majority of the cases were in Para state. A couple of
earlier reports in 1999 mention 2 cases in Mato Grosso with 1 death. It
seems that a large number of cases never got notified to WHO - Mod.JW
