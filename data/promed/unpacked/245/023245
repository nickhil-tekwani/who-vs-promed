TY moved from Hacienda Heights, CA, to Norco, CA, last summer to pursue "the dream of having horses and chickens." Now that virulent Newcastle disease [VND] has been discovered in Horsetown USA [Norco, CA], the thought of her chickens possibly having to be put down to halt the virus' spread "makes me sick," TY said. "They're my babies."

TY was among 225 mostly worried people who jammed Norco's Nellie Weaver Hall on Tuesday night, 5 Feb 2019, to learn details about the deadly disease threatening domestic birds in the town of 27 000 that is famous for its country, animal-keeping lifestyle.

No human cases of Newcastle disease have occurred from eating poultry, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's [USDA] website. In "very rare" instances, people working with sick birds have become infected and contracted flu-like symptoms.

Since May [2018], VND has spread to chicken flocks in Riverside, San Bernardino, Los Angeles, and Ventura counties [in California].

Already, 1 million birds have been euthanized across Southern California, including 900 000 in commercial poultry operations and 100 000 in backyard flocks, said Robyn Corcoran, a veterinarian with the USDA.

"There is no treatment for this virus," Corcoran said at the meeting. "And it is almost 100% fatal."

The inland region has been hit particularly hard by the virus, which has shown up in Muscoy in San Bernardino County, the Mira Loma area of Jurupa Valley, Perris, and Nuevo. And on 25 Jan 2019, the disease's presence was confirmed in a backyard in northern Norco. Officials declined to name the location of the property and areas of concern, despite numerous requests from residents.

TB was the 1st of many to ask questions at the meeting. She has more than 100 chickens, most of them the petite Malaysian Serama variety that is the world's smallest. "They make great pets," she said. "They like to be petted. They like attention." And, she added, "Their personalities are a crack-up."

On Wednesday [6 Feb 2019], TB brought out a female Serama named "Zsa Zsa" after the famous actress. The tiny chicken proudly pushed out her chest. "They think they're bad," TB said.

TB said she shows and sells chickens. "My birds have won a lot of awards. I'm looking at losing so much on this. It's just killing me. It's heartbreaking." For now, she said, she is only barred from moving the chickens. But she worries they will be euthanized if the disease spreads farther.

State officials said the biggest obstacle to halting the spread is the moving of birds. And, ironically, some owners panic and move chickens out of fear about the outbreak.

Some owners, such as TY, are calmly taking precautions.

TY and EH don't let their chickens out of a barn-like coop on their nearly one-acre property, and they scrub rubber boots with a solution before and after entering the area.

"If we're doing our part, I think they (state officials) will be less prone to take them," TY said. She said the chickens have an attitude right now. "They're a little angry and upset about being cooped up. But it's only temporary to keep them safe."

For many in Norco, chickens aren't merely farm animals. They are family.

CD said his 5 chickens are special to daughters, age 15 and 11. One came to live with the family after the 11-year-old rescued it from drowning in a puddle a year ago.

"Of course, I'm not taking them out and playing with them as much as I do with my dogs," the 15-year-old said. "But I have a relationship with them."

Others don't.

TM has lived in Norco 30 years and has kept chickens just as long. And he remembers the last major outbreak in 2002-2003 that hammered the town particularly hard. But he's not worried.

"It is what it is," TM said. "Mine are just backyard chickens that you get eggs from. I don't have a big emotional attachment to my chickens."

"This is by far our largest turnout," Steve Lyle, a spokesman for the California Department of Food and Agriculture, said of the meeting in Norco.

VND information:

The threat: All birds can be infected. In most cases, infected chickens die. Other birds may not get sick but still can spread the disease.

The human factor: Properly cooked meat and eggs from infected chickens are safe to eat. In rare instances, people in close contact with infected birds may get a mild fever and redness and swelling around the eyes.

Spreading the disease: Birds spread the disease through coughing and sneezing as well as droppings. People spread the disease by moving birds.

What to do if a bird is sick: Call the Sick Bird Hotline, 866-922-2473 (BIRD).

What a sick bird looks like: Signs include swelling around the eyes, a purplish swelling of the wattle and comb, a twisting of the neck and head, and a large amount of fluid coming from the beak and nasal areas.

How to protect birds: Wash hands and scrub boots before and after entering an area with chickens. Clean and disinfect equipment. Isolate birds returning from a show for 30 days before placing with a flock. Don't bring new birds onto one's property while the disease is present in California.

[There are numerous pet birds and exotic and/or rare chickens kept as pets and show animals. Those keeping them as pets know their personalities and genuinely enjoy their pets. It is very sad to think something could happen to their pets. We hope all bird owners will be overly cautious and take extra precautions to keep their birds healthy.

Even those producers who raise backyard eggs would not like losing their investment or their eggs even though they are not emotionally attached to their birds.

Certainly, don't move the birds, as we have seen that the disease was recently transported to Utah for a show, and now some birds there have the disease.

While washing hands and boots before and after entering a containment area is a good idea, it may also be appropriate to wear a mask so that you don't exhale any viral particles if you are coming down with a respiratory or sinus situation.

What is really horrible is how long this has been going on without any plan to protect birds. After the fiasco of huge number of bird deaths in 2003, one has to wonder why scientists, and especially those at universities and government entities, have not been working on vaccine development. Why let this situation repeat itself 16 years later? Why do we not have a vaccine? We have the technology, and it can be and should have been already in the works and ready to deploy. - Mod.TG
