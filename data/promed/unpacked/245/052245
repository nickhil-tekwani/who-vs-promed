Update: Adverse Events Following Smallpox Vaccination --- United
States, 2003
-------------------
During 24 Jan 2003 -- 28 Mar 2003, smallpox vaccine was
administered to 29 584 civilian health-care and public health workers
in 54 jurisdictions as part of an effort to prepare the United States
for a terrorist attack using smallpox virus. This report summarizes
data on 10 cases of cardiac adverse events reported among civilian
vaccinees since the beginning of the smallpox vaccination program,
including 3 new cardiac adverse events reported to CDC from the
Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) during 24-30
Mar 2003.
14 cases of myocarditis and one fatal myocardial infarction have
been reported among military personnel.
This report summarizes data on the 3 new cases of cardiac adverse
events, updates data on 7 previously reported cases among civilian
vaccinees (Table 1 from reference 1 below), summarizes selected
cases of cardiac adverse events among military vaccinees, and
updates information on all adverse events reported in the civilian
vaccination program as of 30 Mar 2003.
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213a4.htm>
CDC, the Food and Drug Administration, and state health
departments are conducting surveillance for vaccine-associated
adverse events among civilian vaccinees; the Department of
Defense (DoD) is conducting surveillance for vaccine-associated
adverse events among military vaccinees. In the first stage of the
civilian program, active surveillance is being conducted for any
adverse events after vaccination that require medical care.
In the military vaccination program, military personnel receive
medical care primarily in a network of linked clinics that report
adverse events to medical headquarters and VAERS.
Civilian Case Reports
-------------------
The 3 new cases of cardiac adverse events among civilians during
24-30 Mar 2003 include 2 cases of myopericarditis and one case of
myocardial infarction (Table 1):
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213a4.htm>
Case 1. A man aged 56 years with a history of mild hypertension
and hypertriglyceridemia was revaccinated on 4 Mar 2003. On 16
Mar 2003, he had onset of influenza-like illness (ILI), chest
discomfort while lying flat, and pleuritic pain during inspiration; a
clinical examination revealed tachycardia. During the next 7 days,
he had chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, fever, chills, pallor, and left
knee pain. All symptoms and signs had resolved 17 days after
vaccination. On day 23 post vaccination, an electrocardiogram
(ECG) indicated low R waves in the anterior leads and borderline
first-degree AV block (PR interval: 0.21 msec). Echocardiogram
revealed widening of the pericardial space with minimal fluid
collection, a normal ejection fraction, and normal ventricular wall
function. Chest radiograph demonstrated left basilar atelectasis. The
patient had normal troponin I, creatine kinase myocardial band (CK-
MB), C-reactive protein levels, and a normal erythrocyte
sedimentation rate. These findings are consistent with mild
myopericarditis. The patient recovered; a follow-up exercise cardiac
perfusion scan was normal.
Case 2. A woman aged 32 years with no history of cardiac disease
or major risk factors for coronary artery disease was vaccinated for
the first time on 31 Jan 2003. On 16 Feb 2003, she had fever,
crushing-type chest pain, and shortness of breath, which prompted
a visit to the emergency department (ED). An ECG indicated
nonspecific ST-T wave changes; cardiac enzymes were normal. A
repeat ECG several days later was normal. After 5--6 days, her
symptoms resolved completely, and she was able to resume normal
activities. 6 weeks after vaccination, a nuclear stress test was
normal. Her clinical course and ECG findings were consistent with
myopericarditis.
Case 3. An active man aged 64 years with a history of dyspnea on
exertion and productive cough for 3 months and 8 previous smallpox
vaccinations was revaccinated on 21 Mar 2003. On 23 Mar 2003, he
sought medical care for chest "fullness" and dizziness. Blood tests
indicated elevated troponin I and CK-MB levels. ECG demonstrated
inferior ST segment depression and T wave inversion.
Echocardiography indicated moderate inferior wall hypokenesis with
a normal ejection fraction. Coronary arteriography showed 3-vessel
atherosclerotic disease with development of some collateral
circulation. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization with
balloon atherotomy, and 2 coronary artery stents were placed. The
clinical course and laboratory findings are consistent with acute
myocardial infarction in a patient with chronic coronary artery
disease. He returned to work on 31 Mar 2003.
Update on Previous Civilian Cardiac Adverse Events
------------------------------------------------
On 23 Mar 2003, a woman aged 55 years with a history of
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and smoking died 5 days after
smallpox vaccination (1). Autopsy showed extensive atherosclerotic
disease, with right coronary artery thrombosis and lateral wall
softening. Preliminary testing, including real-time polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry, showed evidence of
vaccinia virus only at the vaccination site; limited analyses of other
tissues, including heart and other visceral tissue, were negative for
vaccinia virus by real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry.
On 26 Mar 2003, a woman aged 57 years with a history of smoking,
hypertension, transient ischemic attack, and carotid endarterectomy
died 22 days after smallpox vaccination (1). Autopsy showed
extensive atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries and a large
healing infarct involving the posterior wall of the left ventricle and
intraventricular septum. Histopathologic evaluation revealed no
evidence of myocarditis or pericarditis. Preliminary analysis using
real-time PCR tests showed evidence of vaccinia virus DNA at the
vaccination site but not in affected myocardium or other viscera.
Military Case Reports
-------------------
During 25-31 Mar 2003, 4 cases of myocarditis and/or pericarditis
were identified, totaling 14 cases among approximately 250 000
personnel who received smallpox vaccination for the first time. No
cases of myocarditis and/or pericarditis were identified among
approximately 115 000 service members who were revaccinated.
Among the approximately 365 000 vaccinated military service
members, one death has been reported.
The 14 patients with myocarditis and/or pericarditis ranged in age
from 21 to 33 years. Severity ranged from mild (no ECG or
echocardiogram changes) to severe (congestive heart failure), with
onset 7 to 19 days after vaccination. All military patients were
hospitalized, and all survived. As of 2 Apr 2003, the patient with
the most severe case has been hospitalized for 6 days. All other
hospitalized patients have been discharged; they have either
returned to duty or are on short-term convalescent leave. Following
are 2 cases that represent the spectrum of clinical presentations of
myopericarditis and a report of a fatal case of myocardial infarction.
Case 1. On 18 Mar 2003, a man aged 22 years sought medical care
at a military health clinic for chest pain 12 days after primary
smallpox vaccination. He was treated with nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory agents for presumed costochondritis. When laboratory
tests revealed elevated cardiac enzymes levels, he was referred to a
university hospital emergency department (ED) for further
evaluation. Cardiac enzymes levels remained elevated, but an ECG,
echocardiogram, and cardiac stress test were normal.
Myopericarditis was diagnosed, and he was released that day in
good condition.
Case 2. A man aged 29 years had ILI symptoms during the same
week of primary smallpox vaccination. At the time of smallpox
vaccination on 8 Mar 2003, he also received 5 other inactivated
vaccines; 19 days after vaccination, he sought treatment at an ED
for dyspnea while lying flat. On 28 Mar 2003, he was hospitalized
and had myopericarditis diagnosed based on ECG findings and
elevated troponin I and CK-MB. The next day, he had pulmonary
edema with a pulmonary artery wedge pressure of 38 mmHg that
responded well to several doses of intravenous diuretics. Serial
echocardiograms showed ejection fractions as low as 25 percent
that subsequently improved to 45 percent (normal: >55 percent).
Endomyocardial biopsy revealed active myocarditis with a mixed
infiltrate of lymphocytes and eosinophils and evidence of
eosinophilic degranulation in proximity to myocyte necrosis. PCR
testing of myocardial tissue was negative for vaccinia virus DNA,
varicella-zoster virus DNA, and herpes simplex virus DNA;
reverse transcriptase PCR was negative for enterovirus RNA. As of
2 Apr 2003, he remained hospitalized but was stable and improving.
Case 3. On 25 Mar 2003, an Army National Guardsman aged 55
years with a history of smoking and treatment for hyperlipidemia
was found unresponsive in a vehicle 5 days after receiving smallpox
vaccine and 2 other inactivated vaccines. He was resuscitated but
died the next day. Autopsy showed acute thrombosis of the right
anterior descending coronary artery, 3-vessel coronary artery
disease with 75-80 percent occlusion, left ventricular hypertrophy,
and cardiomegaly. Histopathology of left ventricular myocardium
revealed no evidence of myocarditis or pericarditis. Virologic testing
of myocardium is pending. The cause of death was acute
myocardial infarction.
Update on Adverse Events in the Civilian Vaccination Program
-----------------------------------------
As of 30 Mar 2003, no cases of several potentially life-threatening
adverse events associated historically with smallpox vaccination
(i.e., progressive vaccinia, eczema vaccinatum, post-vaccinial
encephalitis, or encephalomyelitis) have been reported among
civilians. In addition, no cases of vaccinia transmission from
civilians have been reported. This includes no transmission from 18
344 members of health-care teams, 6655 of whom have been
followed for longer than 1 month.
During 11-30 Mar 2003, 6 cases of generalized vaccinia, 14 cases
of inadvertent inoculation (nonocular), and 4 cases of
myopericarditis were reported (Table 2:
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213a4.htm>).
During the same period, 12 other serious adverse events were
reported. Of these, 4 were myocardial infarctions, and 2 were cases
of angina (Table 3:
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213a4.htm>).
The remaining 6 other new serious adverse events had hospital
discharge diagnoses of pancreatic cancer, urinary tract infection,
herpes zoster virus infection, headache, and facial paralysis with
paresthesias (Table 3). Among the 192 vaccinees with reported
other nonserious adverse events during 24 Jan 2003-30 Mar 2003
(Table 3), the most common signs and symptoms were fever (n =
42), rash (n = 39), headache (n = 34), and pruritus (n = 32). All of
these commonly reported events are consistent with mild expected
reactions after receipt of smallpox vaccine. Some vaccinees
reported multiple signs and symptoms. During 11-30 Mar 2003, no
vaccinia immune globulin was released for civilian vaccinees (Table
4: <http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213a4.htm>).
Surveillance for adverse events during the civilian and military
smallpox vaccination programs is ongoing; regular surveillance
reports will be published in MMWR.
MMWR Editorial Note:
--------------------
New reports of myopericarditis following smallpox vaccination are
consistent with previous reports describing a potential causal
association between vaccination and myopericarditis (1). One new
case of myocardial infarction among civilian vaccinees and one
death from myocardial infarction among military vaccinees have
been reported, but any association between smallpox vaccine and
ischemic heart disease remains unclear.
Myopericarditis is often asymptomatic or mild, but can be severe.
Symptomatic patients report chest pain, fatigue, fever, palpitations,
and dyspnea on exertion. The patient with myopericarditis and
congestive heart failure reported by DoD illustrates the potential
severity of the condition, which can lead to severe cardiac
dysfunction or dysrhythmia. In addition, rare fatal cases of
myocarditis after smallpox vaccination have been reported in Europe
and Australia (2,3). Evaluation and follow-up guidelines are being
developed by CDC to assist health-care providers in managing
vaccinees with cardiac adverse events.
Preliminary autopsy findings for the 3 patients with myocardial
infarction who died showed no evidence of disseminated vaccinia
infection or myopericarditis. Although virologic testing of
myocardial tissue is pending for one patient and is limited for the
other 2, these findings suggest the ischemic events in these patients
did not result from vaccinia-associated myocarditis. The number of
reported deaths from cardiac disease among civilians and military
personnel is consistent with expected background rates (1).
However, it is not known whether smallpox vaccination could
contribute to these events through another mechanism.
On the basis of the civilian and military cases, and guidance from
the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (4) and an
independent group of cardiology consultants, CDC revised its
recommendations for screening and exclusion of potential smallpox
vaccine recipients. Persons should be excluded from the pre-event
smallpox vaccination program if they have had heart disease or any
type of ischemic cardiovascular disease diagnosed, with or without
symptoms (e.g., previous myocardial infarction, angina, congestive
heart failure, cardiomyopathy, stroke or transient ischemic attack,
or other heart conditions under the care of a doctor). Persons also
should be excluded if they have 3 or more risk factors:
hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, smoking, or an
immediate family member who had onset of a heart condition before
age 50. To date, 5 of the 6 vaccinated civilians with cardiac adverse
events indicative of ischemic heart disease met these exclusion
criteria.

[The preliminary studies on the fatal myocardial events temporally
related to receipt of smallpox vaccine seem to demonstrate that the
etiology of the myocardial event was not related to vaccinia viral
infection of the myocardium. While these deaths could have been
unrelated to receipt of vaccine, the additional recommendations to
screen out those individuals with histories that would predispose to
myocardial infarction still appears prudent, as other factors may be
contributing to these events.

<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5207a1.htm>.
With respect to current observed adverse event rates, according to
the latest statistics there have been 20 serious adverse events
related to receipt of smallpox vaccine out of 29 584 vaccinations
given, representing a serious adverse event rate of 676 per 1 000
000 doses administered. The 6 reported cases of generalized
vaccinia translates to a rate of 203 per 1 000 000 doses
administered, and the 15 inadvertent inoculations (non-ocular)
translate to a rate of 507 per 1 000 000 doses administered. -
