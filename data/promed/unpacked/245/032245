The Centre for Health Protection has received 3 more reports of cases
of typhoid fever, bringing to 15 the total number since 25 Nov 2005.
The 3 cases involve 2 men aged 24 and 25 and a 24-year-old woman.
They live in Tsing Yi, Sham Shui Po and Yuen Long.
The 3 fell ill on 26, 27 and 29 Dec 2005 respectively, with symptoms
of fever, abdominal pain and vomiting. The 24-year-old man was
admitted to Princess Margaret Hospital on 29 Dec 2005 and the
25-year-old man was admitted to the Caritas Medical Centre on 31 Dec.
The woman was admitted to Tuen Mun Hospital on 2 Jan 2006. All are
in a stable condition.
Among the 14 locally acquired cases, 10 involved residents of Yuen
Long district.
Commenting on the cluster of typhoid fever cases in Yuen Long, the
Centre for Health Protection said that since the incubation period of
the disease could stretch to 3 weeks or more, the detection of
previously infected cases in the district this week was not unexpected.
The Centre and the Food & Environmental Hygiene Department are
investigating any possible links between the newly notified case in
Yuen Long and previous cases in the district.
Preliminary investigation of the other 2 new cases revealed that the
patients had not visited Yuen Long district before the onset of
symptoms. The centre also pointed out that territory-wide sporadic
typhoid fever cases were reported throughout the year.
Of the 414 samples taken so far for laboratory testing, 382 yielded
negative results for _Salmonella typhi_. The remaining samples are
being tested.
Meanwhile, laboratory results have shown that DNA fingerprinting of a
previous case in Tuen Mun is compatible with that of the Yuen Long
cluster. The Tuen Mun patient consumed food in Yuen Long during the
incubation period.
Despite the fact that no common food premises have so far been
identified to account for all the cases, investigations focusing on
possible common food vehicles or food handlers are continuing.
There were 36 cases of typhoid fever in 2005, 53 in 2004, 49 in 2003,
67 in 2002 and 67 in 2001.

Preliminary investigations have revealed that the bacteria in 7 of
the typhoid fever cases recently reported in Yuen Long may be from
the same source, Centre for Health Protection Consultant Dr Thomas Tsang says.
Investigations showed that children and teenagers were predominantly
affected. Most cases were localized in Tin Shui Wai and Long Ping
Tsuen in Yuen Long. No single food outlet was patronized by all of
the patients. Investigations are ongoing with special attention to
food with localized distribution in that area and food with special
appeal to young people.
Dr Tsang said special investigations were being conducted to
ascertain whether food vehicles or food handlers could be the source
of infection. These include epidemiological studies and the
collection of over 200 samples for laboratory testing. More results
are expected over the next 2 to 3 weeks.
During the past month, starting on 25 Nov 2005, the centre received
12 typhoid cases, involving 9 patients in Yuen Long, 1 in Tuen Mun
and 1 in Sham Shui Po. One other case was classified as imported.
For the case in Sham Shui Po and the imported case, laboratory tests
showed that they were unlikely to be related to the cases in Yuen
Long. Results of tests for the remaining cases are pending.

St. Petersburg has been unsuccessful in combating a typhoid fever
outbreak. All in all, 49 people have been hospitalized in 2005, and 3
of them died, Oleg Parkov from the city Department of the Federal
Consumer Rights and Human Well-Being Service told a press conference.
He said the city had 8 typhoid fever patients in 2004, and the
typhoid fever forecast for 2006 was unfavorable.
Typhoid fever cases occurred in nearly all population strata, from
public utility employees, students and veterinarians to a tourist
company manager. Some of the patients came from Central Asia.
