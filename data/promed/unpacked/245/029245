Venezuela: 2nd rabies death in Zulia state this year
-----------------------------------------------
On Sun 25 Apr 2004, the Head of the Epidemiology Department of the
Venezuelan Ministry for Health and Social Development reported the
death of a boy from Maracaibo from rabies.
In a 13-year period, there have been 21 rabies deaths in the state of
Zulia, 2 of which occurred this year [2004].
The Head of Epidemiology commented that this situation indicates
deficiencies in the regional health system. He also placed special
emphasis on the need for immediate vaccination of people who have
been bitten by dogs or cats.

[This report implies, but does not confirm, that the victim was
bitten by a rabid dog or cat. Further information would be
appreciated regarding the source of infection, especially in view of
a recent report implicating vampire bats in the transmission of
rabies in an Amazonian town in Portel in the state of Para (Northern
Brazil) [see references below]. Vampire bat attacks on humans in
Venezuela have been documented (e.g. Caraba, Rev Saude Publica 30;
483-484, 1996), and it is likely that both vampire and insectivorous
bats play a role in the maintenance of rabies infection in Venezuela
and in other Latin American countries. Genetic characterization and
antigenic analyses of isolates from human cases of rabies in
Venezuela (de Mattos et al., J Clin Microbiol 34; 1553-1558, 1996)
have revealed considerable diversity and identified several antigenic
variants. Recognition of the source of outbreaks of dog-transmitted
rabies may be necessary to achieve satisfactory control of rabies. -
