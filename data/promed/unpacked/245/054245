NSW [New South Wales] Health is urging parents and young people to be alert to the symptoms of meningococcal disease and act immediately if they appear. So far this year [2022], 15 cases of meningococcal disease have been reported in NSW. Sadly, a man in his 40s from Sydney has died with the disease. His infection was identified following his death and notified to NSW Health yesterday [4 Aug 2022]. NSW Health expresses its sincere condolences to his loved ones.

While meningococcal disease is now uncommon thanks to vaccination, it can occur year-round. We tend to see increases in late winter and early spring, with children under 5 and 15 to 25 year olds at the greatest risk of contracting the disease.

Executive director of health protection NSW, Dr Jeremy McAnulty said early intervention can be lifesaving: "Onset of meningococcal disease symptoms can appear suddenly and become very serious very quickly. If you suspect meningococcal disease, don't wait for the rash -- see a doctor immediately."

Meningococcal disease can be fatal within hours if left untreated. Knowing the symptoms could help prevent premature death or life-long disability. They include severe, unexplained limb pain; difficulty waking up; high pitched crying in babies; severe headache; upset by bright lights; stiff neck; and red-purple rash which doesn't disappear when pressed with a glass. "While it is a well-known symptom of meningococcal disease, the rash does not always occur, or may present late in the illness," Dr McAnulty said. "If symptoms rapidly worsen, or if your child is very unwell, call triple zero (000) or go straight to your nearest emergency department."

Meningococcal disease is a rare but serious and sometimes fatal infection. Up to 1 in 10 cases die, and 4 in 10 infections result in permanent disabilities, including learning difficulties, sight and hearing problems, liver and kidney failure, loss of fingers, toes, or limbs, or scarring caused by skin grafts.

Vaccination is the best way to protect yourself, your loved ones and community from the harmful effects of meningococcal disease. Under the National Immunisation Program, meningococcal ACWY (Men ACWY) vaccine is provided free for babies at 12 months, adolescents, and people of all ages with certain medical conditions. In NSW, the adolescent dose is delivered through the school vaccination program in year 10.

As of 1 Jul 2020, Aboriginal children up to the age of 2 years, and people with certain medical conditions, can also access free meningococcal B (Men B) vaccine. All children from 6 weeks of age can have the Men B vaccine to reduce the risk of infection.

For more information on vaccination or symptoms, transmission, risks and treatment of meningococcal, see the NSW Health website.

[In the United States, 95% of cases of invasive meningococcal disease are sporadic, each case unrelated to the other cases; meningococcal outbreaks account for only about 5% of reported cases. Whether any of the 15 cases of IMD reported in New South Wales (NSW) so far this year (2022) constitute an outbreak requires further epidemiologic and laboratory information (that is, determination of serogroup and molecular typing).

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that:
"All cases of meningococcal disease of the same serogroup should be included in the outbreak case count unless molecular typing indicates that the strain from a case is genetically different than the predominant outbreak strain. In outbreaks with well-defined risk groups, probable cases may be included as outbreak-associated even if they are unable to be confirmed or serogrouped.

"The outbreak threshold for vaccine decision-making should be determined on a case-by-case basis, using the following general guidance:
- Organization-based outbreak: 2-3 outbreak-associated cases within an organization during a 3-month period
- Community-based outbreak: Multiple outbreak-associated cases with an incidence of meningococcal disease that is above the expected incidence in a community during a 3-month period" (https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/downloads/meningococcal-outbreak-guidance.pdf).

More information from knowledgeable sources concerning these cases of invasive meningococcal disease in NSW would be appreciated. - Mod.ML
