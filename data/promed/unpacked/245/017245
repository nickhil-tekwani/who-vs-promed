WHITE NOSE SYNDROME, BATS - USA (15)

There has been a great deal of discussion of possible in-situ
treatments for bats affected by WNS among those most actively
studying it. Unfortunately, hibernating bats may or may not have the
environmental cues or physical ability to feed in the caves where
they hibernate. They are finely tuned to spend a portion of their
lives in torpor; they simply may not have faced a challenge of this
type so as to develop a winter feeding strategy.

Because they are in torpor in the caves where they hibernate and in a
reduced metabolic and immune status, there is little reason to expect
a treatment to be effective. Nor are they likely to allogroom during
winter torpor, making application of topical treatment difficult at best.

Further, I caution against any suggestions to alter cave conditions.
Bats are most certainly not the only organisms to depend on caves.
Altering cave conditions threatens a host of cave-dependant organisms
that may be as fragile as bat populations. Caves are extremely
complex ecosystems and altering temperatures or humidity levels may
threaten an entire host of organisms, many of which are yet to be described.

In-situ work on treatments or environmental alteration is, to the
best of my knowledge, being carried out in abandoned mines where the
threat to native ecosystems is reduced. Responsible researchers are
looking at all the questions posed in the earlier post.
Unfortunately, WNS is moving more rapidly than meager financial
resources can be deployed to study it. And since the public health
community only seems to value research into bats as potential
reservoirs for human disease and, in the US at least, there is a
widespread antipathy toward bats in the public health arena, it is
hard to hold out hope that a rapid deployment of financial resources
will be possible, at least in time to save the cave dependant species
of the northeastern US.

Sorry to say this, but this community in particular could do a lot to
further WNS research by relaxing its anti-bat stance, particularly in
municipal public health departments. These disappearing bat species
will need help in the form of human assistance in habitat
enhancement, and that probably means bat boxes and building
modifications. Yes, bat rabies is a public health threat, but by
launching effective education programs coupled with responsible
conservation efforts, we can protect public health and bat
populations at the same time.

Bats, like mosquitoes, ticks, raccoons, etc., are integral parts of
the ecosystems in which they exist. But unlike mosquitoes, ticks, and
raccoons, their populations were declining, and WNS is now causing
the greatest declines in multiple species of a single order ever in
recorded history in North America.
