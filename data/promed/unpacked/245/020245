Epidemiological comments: Last confirmation of _Mycobacterium caprae_: 30 Jul 2018; last confirmation of _Mycobacterium bovis_: 18 Apr 2015. These are single cases and hence Germany still meets the requirements for freedom of infection with _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ complex according to the Terrestrial Animal Health Code Chapter 8.11, article 8.11.4.

Control measures
Measures applied: Movement control inside the country, screening, traceability, official destruction of animals products, official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste, selective killing and disposal, slaughter, ante- and post-mortem inspections, vaccination prohibited, no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
LAVES Veterinary Institute, Oldenburg (regional laboratory) / Cattle / Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 8 May 2019 / Positive
Bavarian Health and Food Safety Authority (LGL), Oberschleissheim (regional laboratory) / Cattle / Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 15 Mar 019 / positive
SVUA Arnsberg (Regional Laboratory) / Cattle / Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 23 May 2019 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[The above immediate OIE notification deals with 3 events, in different German states ("Lander"):

1. A farm in Bayern (Bavaria), where 31 of 42 cattle (ages and husbandry method not given) were found infected by _M. caprae_. Outbreak started 8 Mar 2019, resolved 17 Apr 2019. No culling ("Killed and disposed of") nor slaughter reported.
2. A farm in Niedersachsen (Lower Saxony) , where 1 of 205 cattle (ages and husbandry method not given) was found infected by _M. caprae_. Outbreak started 6 May 2019; the status of the outbreak is "continuing" (probably, additional tests expected). The single infected animal was "killed and disposed of".
3. A farm in Nordrhein-Westfalen (North Rhine-Westphalia), where 120 of 226 cattle were found infected by _M. bovis_. (For more information on the affected population, please see further). The outbreak started 21 May 2019; its status is "continuing" (probably, additional tests expected).

The following additional information addressing the 3rd outbreak, caused by _M. bovis_, has been extracted/abridged from a press release published on 21 Jun 2019 by the State Office for Nature, Environment and Consumer Protection, North Rhine-Westphalia:

"According to the prevailing regulations, when tuberculosis is detected in cattle herds, retrospective epidemiological investigations should go 5 years back. This is meant to trace back or exclude sources or targets of spreading infection during the said period. Contact animals should be sought and identified in other German states or other EU countries, involving the relevant veterinary authorities.

"So far, the origin and route of pathogen introduction has not been cleared; the investigation is continuing. It is known that the 2 farms maintain close connection. Female calves are moved at the age of 3-5 months from the dairy operation in Meinerzhagen to the rearing plant in Frondenberg, where they are kept until the final stage of pregnancy. They return to the dairy farm in Meinerzhagen about 4 weeks before their expected calving date".

The full press release, including the above and additional information, is available (in German) at https://www.lanuv.nrw.de/fileadmin/lanuv/presse/dokumente/2019-06-21_PM_Rinder-TBC_M%C3%A4rkischer_Kreis_Unna.pdf; thanks to Sabine Zentis.

Final findings in the 2 continuing outbreaks and epidemiological findings clarifying the source of infections, in particular in relation to the route of _M. bovis_ introduction and possible spread relating to outbreak 3, are anticipated with interest. - Mod.AS
