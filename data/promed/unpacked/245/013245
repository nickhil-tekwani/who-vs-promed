Classical swine fever, Israel
-----------------------------
Information received on 4 Mar 2009 from Dr Moshe Chaimovitz,
Director, Veterinary Services and Animal Health, Ministry of
Agriculture and Rural Development, BEIT DAGAN, Israel

Summary
Report type: Immediate notification
Start date: 15 Feb 2009
Date of 1st confirmation of the event: 2 Mar 2009
Report date: 4 Mar 2009
Date submitted to OIE: 4 Mar 2009
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence of a listed disease
Manifestation of disease: Clinical disease
Causal agent: Classical swine fever virus
Nature of diagnosis: Suspicion, Clinical, Laboratory (basic),
Laboratory (advanced), Necropsy
This event pertains to the whole country

New outbreaks
Outbreak 1 (FASSUTA) FASSUTA, Acco, HAZAFON
Date of start of the outbreak: 15 Feb 2009
Outbreak status: Continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Farm

Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Wild species / na / na / 11 / 1 / 0
Swine / 500 / 70 / 20 / 1 / 0

Affected population: The population of the pigs in the farm is
divided into 2 premises 70 miles from each other. The affected
animals were discovered only in one of the 2 premises where 500
pregnant sows and 6 males stay. Clinical signs were fever, anorexia,
multifocal hyperemia and hemorrhagic lesions of the skin, vomiting,
coughing, ataxia and death. Post-mortem investigation has revealed
lesions that fit classical swine fever.

Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak statistics
Species / Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate /
Apparent case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Wild species / ** / ** / ** / **
Swine / 14.00 percent / 4.00 percent / 28.57 percent / 4.20 percent

* Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction
and/or slaughter
** Not calculated because of missing information

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection:
- Unknown or inconclusive
- Fomites (humans, vehicles, feed, etc.)
- Contact with wild species

Epidemiological comments: The farm is located at about 3.5 km from
the Lebanese border, through which wild boars can pass. 11 wild boars
were found dead in a 4-km-radius area around the farm. Toxicological
results were negative. Antigen detection has shown a positive result
for classical swine fever and bovine viral diarrhea. Advanced
laboratory tests (PCR) performed in the Kimron Veterinary Institute
(Israel) has found the virus in domestic pigs. The PCR has shown 97
percent homology with the virus isolates from China (2002) and 98
percent homology with the virus isolates from Germany (1997).

The final diagnosis is still pending since it is the 1st time that
the disease has been detected in Israel, and the results from the OIE
reference laboratory in Germany (University of Veterinary Medicine -
Hanover) are expected for confirmation.

Control measures
Measures applied
- Quarantine
- Movement control inside the country
- No vaccination
- No treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied:
- Control of wildlife reservoirs
- Screening
- Vaccination in response to the outbreak (s)
- Disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s)
- Modified stamping out

Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type: Kimron Veterinary Institute, Rabies
Laboratory (National laboratory)
Tests and results
Species Test Test date Result
Swine polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 3 Mar 2009 Positive
Wild species polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 4 Mar 2009 Pending
Laboratory name and type Kimron Veterinary Institute, Virology
Laboratory (National laboratory)
Tests and results:
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Swine / antibody detection ELISA / 2 Mar 2009 / Positive
Swine / antigen (Ag) detection ELISA / 28 Feb 2009 / Doubtful (uncertain)
Swine / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 4 Mar 2009 / Pending
Wild species / antibody detection ELISA / 2 Mar 2009 / Positive
Wild species / antigen (Ag) detection ELISA / 3 Mar 2009 / Doubtful
(uncertain)

[Israel's pork industry is concentrated in the north (Western
Galilee). According to State law, no pig breeding is allowed in other
parts of the country. The number of slaughtered pigs during 2007
(last year of available statistics) exceeded 170 000. Wild boars, an
abundant species within Israel's northern districts and particularly
in areas adjacent to the borders with Lebanon, Syria and northwestern
Jordan, are most likely the source of infection. In the past, wild
boars have been found infected with FMD in the same regions. It will
be interesting to obtain information on the disease situation in the
neighboring countries, and particularly in Lebanon, where pig farming
is of considerable magnitude (Lebanon is known for an exceptionally
high rate of human trichinellosis).

Fassuta is on the Lebanese border (see map in the OIE notification). - Mod.AS]
