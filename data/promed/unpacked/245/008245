Community gatherings pose typhoid danger
----------------------------------------
Medical officials have warned people attending weddings, funerals, and
birthdays in the north to take care because of a typhoid outbreak.
Savusavu sub-divisional medical officer Doctor Mohammed Ishak said the
typhoid outbreak in Savusavu spread fast when a woman from one of the
villages in the area attended a funeral in town, unaware she was suffering
from typhoid. "The disease spread when people came in from villages for
funerals and other gatherings," Dr Ishak said. "That was before we could
detect the outbreak and this was 2 months ago." Dr Ishak said the hospital
was receiving cases from different areas because those who attended the
funeral had gone back to their respective villages with the disease. "To
date we have 50 confirmed typhoid cases."
He said one of the major areas of concern was the gathering of communities.
"Like funerals, weddings, birthdays -- because that is where food is
prepared and that is where most of the cases are focused. In investigations
by the outbreak team they have clearly identified these [events] as sources
of typhoid," he continued.
Ishak said Savusavu Hospital had an outbreak team visiting settlements and
villages 3 times a week -- mainly to create awareness of the risks involved
with typhoid. He said the outbreak team had visited all schools first
before visiting other communities and villages. He also said that typhoid
was spread from human to human [see comment below], especially through
human waste.

[It is difficult to assess numbers here, since the previous postings do not
clearly state whether the case numbers are for a given time period or are
cumulative. Although the posting attributes Dr Ishak as saying that the
typhoid bacillus spreads from human to human, this is not entirely correct.
Typhoid fever is not a zoonosis like most other salmonellae, but
transmission is not person-to-person as such but rather through water or
food contaminated with human feces. It is the water or food (contaminated
by water or a food handler) served at gatherings that may be the vehicle
for transmission. - Mod.LL]
