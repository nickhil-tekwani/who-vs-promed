[On 22 Oct 2020 there were 2 human St Louis encephalitis (SLE) cases in California and by 11 Dec 2020 there were 5 cases. Mosquito monitoring found 510 positive samples. The previous case was fatal but this one is recovering at home. St. Louis encephalitis virus is found nearly every year in California, sometimes in mosquitoes, sometimes causing cases in humans.

The USA CDC reports that most people infected with SLE virus have no apparent illness (https://www.cdc.gov/sle/). The 1% who become ill develop fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, and tiredness. Severe neuroinvasive disease (often involving encephalitis) occurs more commonly in older adults, as was the 1st case in 2020 (see St. Louis encephalitis virus - USA (02): (CA) fatal 20200905.7749005). Rarely, long-term disability or death can result. Unfortunately, there are no vaccines or medications available for human use. Avoidance of mosquito bites is the only preventive measure available. - Mod.TY
