The death toll from a suspected Ebola virus outbreak in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo has risen to 50 with more areas reporting the
disease, Health Minister Mashako Mamba said on Saturday. Mashako said on
state television that the registered number of cases of the haemorrhagic
fever had gone up sharply to 78 from 52 announced by the World Health
Organisation on Friday.
WHO's representative in Kinshasa, Dr Abdou Moudi, said on Friday that 46
people had died of haeomorrhagic fever in Watsa, in Ituri district of
Oriental Province, since January. Watsa is 140 km (90 miles) from Uganda's
western border with Congo.
Mashako said more cases and deaths had been reported in Faradje and Isirio,
which are 300 km (180 miles) apart Oriental Province. Faradje is less than
50 km (30 miles) from the Congolese border with Sudan.
"The epicentre is not Watsa, but Faradje," the minister said. "After
Faradje, which seems to be the principal base, Watsa looks like the second
base. And we have also learned that of the sick who left Watsa, some have
turned up at Mungbere and others arrived at Isiro," Mashako said.
On Friday Moudi said cases reported in Watsa since the disease first
surfaced in January had symptoms of massive haemorrhaging, sudden high
fevers, severe headache and weakness, usually followed by death within 48
hours.
"This epidemic looks very much like the Ebola virus but for now let's speak
of haemorrhagic fever pending confirmation," said Congolese virologist
Jean-Jacques Muyembe, who led local collaboration with
international scientists in the efforts to contain the 1995 epidemic.
Mashako said a medical team had arrived in one of the affected areas and
was treating infected people, but he did not make clear where this was.
Another was due there later on Saturday with protective gear for health
workers and residents. Another team would take samples to be sent to
specialised laboratories for tests.
