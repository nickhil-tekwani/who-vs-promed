The Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health reports monitoring 2 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) in the Mainland.

The 1st case involves a 50-year-old man living in Baise City in Guangxi who had exposure to live poultry. He developed symptoms on 12 Jan 2022 and was admitted for treatment on 13 Jan 2022. The patient is in critical condition.

The 2nd case involves a 35-year-old man living in Zhenjiang City in Jiangsu Province who had visited a live poultry market before onset. He developed symptoms on 15 Jan 2022 and was admitted for treatment on 19 Jan 2022. The patient is in critical condition.

From 2014 to date [15 Feb 2022], 67 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported by Mainland health authorities.

Avian influenza is caused by those influenza viruses that mainly affect birds and poultry, such as chickens or ducks. Clinical presentation of avian influenza in humans may range from flu-like symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches) to severe respiratory illness (e.g., chest infection). Eye infection (conjunctivitis) and gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting and diarrhea) have also been reported. The incubation period ranges from 7 to 10 days. The more virulent forms can result in respiratory failure, multi-organ failure and even death.

People mainly become infected with avian influenza virus through contact with infected birds and poultry (live or dead) or their droppings, or contact with contaminated environments (such as wet markets and live poultry markets). Human-to-human transmission is inefficient. People in close contact with poultry are more susceptible to contracting avian influenza. The elderly, children and people with chronic illness have a higher risk of developing complications such as bronchitis and chest infection.

[Based on the above report, these are the 4th and 5th human cases of avian influenza A/H5N6 in 2022, with 67 human cases reported in China since 2014. Both the reported cases are in critical condition.

According to reports received by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), various influenza A(H5) subtypes continue to be detected in birds in Africa, Europe, and Asia.

Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk for sporadic infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Therefore, sporadic human cases are not unexpected. Intensive surveillance should be continued to detect cases and early changes in transmissibility and infectivity of these viruses, as the frequency of cases appears to be increasing. - Mod.UBA
