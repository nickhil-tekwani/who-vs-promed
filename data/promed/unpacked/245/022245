Recently several cases of EHEC in small children have occured in the
southern parts of Sweden (Halland). Wild geese, particularly the Canada
goose, Branta canadensis, grazing on public beaches have been suspected of
transmitting the E. coli O157 infection by faecal droppings.
Does someone out there know if E. coli O157 has been found in wild birds??
