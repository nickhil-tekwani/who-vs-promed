Economical Post-exposure Prophylaxis For Rabies
-------------------------------------------
Dr. Warrell has given a good and definitely urgently needed overview
on the current situation of intradermal vaccination against rabies
[see reference above. I would just like to add one item:
At the last WHO Consultation in June 2000 in Bangkok (WHO Report
WHO/CDS/
CSR/APH/2000.5) the following statement was issued on *intradermal*
regimens:
"In Thailand, PCECV (Rabipur TM) 0.1 ml per id site has been used for
post-exposure treatment according to the 2-2-2-0-1-1 regimen. A
recently published study (see section 2.1.3) showed good
immunogenicity. The use of PCECV 0.1 ml per id site in a 2-2-2-0-1-1
regiment may be considered for use by national health authorities.
This does not apply to any other vaccine."
