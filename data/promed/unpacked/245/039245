re: ProMED Hantavirus - Americas (10): USA (CO) 20201104.7914901
----------------------------------------------------------------
The exact hantaviral pathogen, causing acute (apparently non-cardiogenic) pulmonary edema and pericarditis in this woman is presumed being Sin Nombre virus (SNV), but was not specified in the Fox 8 article. In the same article, hantaviral infections were called "an extremely rare and often fatal disease", which might perhaps apply to so-called hantavirus cardio-pulmonary syndrome (HCPS) cases, with a fatality rate of now about 35 %, and mainly caused by autochthonous American hantaviruses that is, mainly North-American SNV and (South-American) Andes virus (ANDV). However this paradigm does not at all apply to Old World hantaviruses, being mainly PUUV [Puumala virus], SEOV [Seoul virus], HTNV [Hantaan virus], and DOBV [Dobrava virus], and causing so-called hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). The fatality rate of these HFRS forms varies between 0.5 (PUUV) and 15% (HTNV and DOBV), and PUUV-induced HFRS is a common flu-like affection in West-Europe, and mainly in Scandinavia, where for example, a smaller country like Finland registered each year again at least 1000 proven HFRS cases.

An often forgotten notion is moreover that HFRS also occurs in the Americas, since the SEOV rodent reservoir is the omnipresent wild rat [1]. The prior understanding that HFRS cases are limited to the European and Asian continents has repeatedly been revised in the past [2-4]. Growing evidence, including a fatal SEOV-induced HCPS + HFRS case described by Roig et al in 2012 [5], suggests that the syndrome caused by all these "Old World strains" is no longer limited to one syndrome or another; rather, patients infected by these strains present with varying degrees of an overlap between the 2 (pulmonary or renal ) syndromes [5]. Human SEOV-induced HFRS cases were first (1993) and most reported from the Baltimore, MD [6], and urban and wharf rats, proven in plaque reduction test (PRNT) to be infected with SEOV, were often demonstrated throughout the USA, and later likewise wherever tested in South-America, from the early 1980s on [1]. In the last decade, studies in limited USA urban areas have shown again a seroprevalence of 50%-58% of SEOV antibodies in rats.

Laboratory findings common to both HCPS and HFRS syndromes are leukocytosis with left shift, low albumin, thrombocytopenia, high hematocrit due to capillary leak, azotemia, transaminitis, and presence of immunoblasts (activated lymphocytes with plasmacytoid features) that can be seen in lungs, blood, bone marrow, liver, or spleen [5]. HFRS has as principal diagnostic signs different degrees of acute renal injury (AKI), a renal lesion consisting in fact of 3 +/- concomitant laboratory anomalies: 1) decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR), 2) proteinuria, and 3) microhematuria. Since these 3 initial renal anomalies are completely asymptomatic, they can easily be missed, particularly in mild cases. Moreover, AKI is too often considered as synonymous to decreased GFR, but in these same mild cases, the "kidney injury" can consist of only very transient proteinuria and/or microhematuria, that is, AKI presenting with normal serum creatinine levels [7,8]. Endothelial hyperpermeability is often described as the main mechanism for transient capillary leak, causing acute symptoms in both HFRS and HCPS. However, in all affected organs, including the kidney, this hyperpermeability involves in fact at least 3 successive layers, all functioning normally as leaking barriers: endothelium (plus its glycocalyx), basement membrane, and epithelium. Concomitant breaching of all these 3 barriers, for example, by a pro-inflammatory "cytokine storm" necessitates an intense paracrine crosstalk, of which hitherto little is known, but can manifest in the kidney as transient proteinuria and microhematuria. The same phenomenon, that is, a massive but transient proteinuria has in the meantime also been demonstrated in another emerging zoonosis, COVID-19, often with AKI in up to 40% of cases.

Consequently, presumptive diagnosis of a HFRS, and probably of all hantaviral infections, can be quickly confirmed on admission by demonstrating both thrombocytopenia, plus proteinuria and microhematuria, the latter by simple, but preferentially daily urine dipstick examination. This easily obtained bedside information is valid for both Old and New World hantaviral human infections. In the latter, whenever early proteinuria and microhematuria were eventually examined, they were confirmed indeed, not only in ANDV infections [9,10], but also in SNV [11] and in New York virus infections [12]. Very recently, the 8th SEOV-HFRS case in the USA was reported by Chand et al in Colorado, being initially considered as non-fatal HCPS with mild interstitial infiltrates on RX chest, with a high (IgM of 1:6400, expected result under 1:100) SNV-specific Ig M titer, but without molecular confirmation by viral sequencing. Nevertheless, the case was reported as being SEOV-induced, since presenting in a farmer with a history of recent rat exposure, and showing a self-remitting 2-weeks course of mild AKI, but with nephrotic-range proteinuria on sequential urine samples: Spot albumin-to-creatinine ratio (1576 mg/G, reference under 30 mg/G), and urine protein (100 mg/dL, reference 0-20 mg/dL). A 24-hour total protein excretion was 861 mg/D (reference 0-101 mg/D) [13].

Consequently, a final etiology is lacking in this case, because of (mostly limited) serologic cross-reactivity between SNV and SEOV, as acknowledged by B Knust and co-authors of CDC Atlanta [14] (I quote): "While antibody cross-reactivity was observed between Old World and New World orthohantavirus assays, the SNV IgM and IgG ELISAs most frequently used in state diagnostic laboratories are poorly sensitive [that is for SEOV]." However, if this 2019 Colorado case had, been after all, SNV-induced instead of SEOV indeed, even then the diagnostic usefulness of proteinuria testing on admission was more than persuasive for the suspicion of a hantaviral infection. Moreover, for 3 pet rat-transmitted 2017 SEOV-HFRS case-patients who sought healthcare during their illness, all 3 had proteinuria detected, and 2 patients had microhematuria [14]. For all these reasons, it can only be deplored that CDC Atlanta still does not advocate this quick and cheap bed-side test for clinical suspicion of any hantaviral infection, e.g. simply by the GP, before considering referral to the hospital. Data of proteinuria and microhematuria are still lacking in most, if not all, hantavirus infection case reports, and even oversights or summaries from the New World. But absence of evidence is no evidence of absence.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Clement for his comments. Dr Clement again makes the point, as he has in the past, that HFRS occurs in the Americas and SEOV should be included in a differential diagnosis. Although not mentioned specifically, the Fox 8 report in the previous post mentions deer mice (_Peromyscus maniculatus_), the reservoir rodent of SNV, but does not indicate that the patient had contact with the mice or areas where the mice were present nor mentions brown rats (_Rattus norvegicus_), the rodent reservoir of SEOV. Testing for proteinuria and microhematuria that Dr Clement proposes are simple 1st steps on the road to diagnosis. Routine laboratory serological tests that can differentiate SEOV and SNV or ANDV are important as well. The distribution and habitats of the 3 rodent reservoir species are different and measures that people should take to avoid contact with them and exposure to the viruses that they carry are correspondingly different. SEOV infections in the Americas should not be misdiagnosed. - Mod.TY]
