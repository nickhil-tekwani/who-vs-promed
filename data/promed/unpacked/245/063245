A recent outbreak in Jahra belies the fact that measles rates in
Kuwait and neighboring countries have decreased dramatically since
the 1980s. See graph:
<http://exhibit.gideononline.com/measles.kuwait.jpg>.
The dramatic resurgence of measles following the 1st Gulf War (1240
cases during 1991 through 1994) was associated with a temporary lapse
in vaccination coverage. See

[Once again, ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. Steve Berger for
sharing the very nice disease surveillance trend data graphs from
GIDEON (Global Infectious Disease and Epidemiology Network). The
background data that were presented in the original posting (Measles
- Kuwait (Jahra) 20070214.0548) were trend data from 1995, clearly
after the major increases in vaccination coverage that occurred
during the 1980s. The sudden drop in coverage followed by an increase
in disease occurrence during the time of civil strife serves as a
reminder of the fragility of disease control efforts when there is a
breakdown in the basic health infrastructure. - Mod.MPP]
