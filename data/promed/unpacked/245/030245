Comment on trichinellosis in Nepal
-------------------------------
Some sporadic human cases of trichinellosis have already been
suspected in Nepal but never confirmed. Recently, specific antibodies
have been found in local pigs but no _Trichinella_ larvae could be
obtained from pork samples (see Joshi DD, Moller LN, Maharjan M,
Kapel CM: Serological evidence of trichinellosis in local pigs of
Nepal. Vet Parasitol. 2005; 132: 155-7). It would be very interesting
to confirm these human cases by antibodies assays and particularly by
using specific western-blot analysis. It is possible to perform these
western-blots from blood drops dried on filter paper. At the French
National Reference Center on Trichinellosis, we confirmed such an
outbreak which occurred in Laos by testing filter papers sent by mail
(see Sayasone S, Odermatt P, Vongphrachanh P et al: A trichinellosis
outbreak in Borikhamxay Province, Lao PDR. Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg.
2006; 100: 1126-9).
We would be happy to help our Nepalese colleagues if they wish.
Details on trichinellosis and on how to manage an outbreak can be
found on the official web site of the International Commission on
Trichinellosis at
