At least 8 people have been confirmed dead and over 150 others admitted in various health units following the outbreak of cholera in Nebbi district. According to the survey carried by New Vision online on Thu, 29 Mar 2012 most of the victims affected by the disease are women and children.

Philbert Otto Acaye, the in-charge Akworo health center III said 6 people have been killed and 74 others have been admitted at the health center in the past week. It was at Akworo health center that the 1st case of cholera was reported Sat, 24 Mar 2012 before spreading to the neighboring sub-counties of Panyimur, Parombo and Pakwach sub-county.

At Dei health center III in Panyimur sub-county, Kimo Henry, the In-charge said 2 people have so died of the disease, and he expressed concern that the death toll is likely to rise due to shortage of drugs at the centre.

Nebbi district had reported the last case of cholera in 2007 and it was attributed to poor sanitation and hygiene but the recent outbreak has left both the politicians and the technocrats in the district baffled about the origin of the disease. Shaban Ofoy, the Panyimur sub-county LC3 chairperson argued that the disease could have originated from neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

The Adabraka Polyclinic in Accra has recorded 33 cholera cases in 2 weeks but no deaths has since been recorded. Victims were said to have contracted the disease from the Adabraka, Odorna, Mamobi and Kasoa-Ofankor areas. Most of affected persons have since said to have been discharged after treatment.

The Osu-Klottey Sub-metro Medical Director of Health, Dr. Bright Davies- Teye, told Joy News TV the outbreak is due to unclean environment and unhygienic practices by the public, with most of the patients contracting the sickness from food they bought from food vendors in town. Dr. Davies-Teye cautioned the public to be particular about where they buy their food from and also encouraged them to practice good personal hygiene and avoid dumping fecal matter in gutters.

[3] Diarrhea - Somalia (Gedo region )

Health workers in the rebel-held southwest Somali town of Bardera, Gedo region, are calling for urgent medical aid to respond to an outbreak of suspected diarrhea in the district. Reports say at least 23 people have been hospitalized following the outbreak of suspected diarrhea in the district. The victims, mainly children and elderly people, are said to be in bad condition.

A doctor in Bardera town who requested not to be named due to security reasons told Suna Times that the situation is getting out of hand, and locals need immediate medical supplies to respond to the emerging human tragedy in the area. He said the few privately owned health facilities in the area do not have enough drugs and trained staff to deal with this diarrhea outbreak. Diarrhoea is common in the area during the rainy seasons.

More than 17 under-5-year-old children have reportedly died of diarrhea-related complications in 2011 in this district. Medics in the area now say the situation at hand is tragic and needs immediate response to avert further human catastrophe in the district.

[4] Diarrhea - Philippines (Quezon province)

A total of 53 persons have been affected by diarrhea in Polilio Island, Quezon, according to the municipal health office. Worst hit by the outbreak is Barangay Taluong, where 40 cases of diarrhea have been reported.

Local officials are considering declaring the barangay under a state of calamity so as to unlock funds needed to repair a busted water pipe that could be the cause of the contaminated water supply. Non-stop rain in the province is also being eyed as one of the reasons for the outbreak.

Authorities will conduct water testing to determine if the water supply in the province has been contaminated.

The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council on Thu, 22 Mar 2012, said at least 7 people have been died of diarrhea as local authorities declared a disease outbreak in Salvador, in Lanao del Norte.

"As per data we received right now, there were 7 people already succumbed to the diarrhea outbreak in Salvador town within this week," NDRRMC Executive Director Benito Ramos said.

"The list indicates that 43 people were affected, with 18 of them being admitted in hospitals for treatment. Local authorities there suspected that the cause is the water from Maranding River". He said health officials and the local government unit have instituted contingency measures such as providing water treatment and medicines to community residents together with water sampling for laboratory testing.

About 127 patients were treated in different hospitals and but some have remained in confinement for further observation. The victims came from the barangays of Azagra, Taclobo, Pili, Agtiwa and Panangcalan.

The council said most of the victims were young from infant to 20 years old.
