CDC has identified the presence (new) of dengue virus type 3 (in addition
to the previously present serotypes 1,2 and 4) after analyzing 50 blood
samples from Ecuador. To date there have been no reports of hemorrhagic
dengue. It is estimated that in Ecuador 2 million individuals have had
"classical" dengue, one million of them in the city of Guayaquil.
