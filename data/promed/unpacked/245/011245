Influenza Update Number 182
---------------------------
Summary
-------
- Influenza activity in North America continued to decrease overall, though activity remained high in some areas. Proportionally, influenza B increased although influenza A(H3N2) was the most commonly detected virus in North America overall for this season. In the USA this season has been more severe than any since 2003-4 as reflected in numbers of pneumonia and influenza deaths with the highest impact for individuals over the age of 65 years.

- Influenza activity continued to decline in the most part of Western Europe, while it remained elevated in the eastern part of the region. The proportion of subtypes of viruses circulating was not uniform across the continent and has changed through the season. It has been notably different from North America with a mix of A(H3N2) and A(H1N1pdm09 and B viruses. Influenza B was mainly reported in western and northern countries and influenza A in eastern and central Europe. Excess mortality in most countries has been moderate and most deaths occurred among people aged 65 and older.

- Influenza activity throughout the temperate region of Asia decreased overall with the exception of Mongolia where activity levels were sustained but still within seasonal tolerance levels.

- Low levels of influenza activity continued to be reported across the tropical regions of the world and activity in countries of the southern hemisphere remained at inter-seasonal levels.

- Since the start of the season a few viruses with reduced susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitors have been detected in the countries performing antiviral resistance testing. The majority of characterized influenza viruses were antigenically similar to the 2012-13 northern hemisphere vaccine viruses.

- In China 3 [now 9, 3 fatal - Mod.CP] cases of influenza H7N9 have been identified, see detail in the Disease Outbreak News http://www.who.int/csr/don/en [and on ProMED]

- The update on human cases of influenza at the human animal interface, 2012 was published in the Weekly Epidemiological Record (http://www.who.int/wer/20

Countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
North America

Overall influenza activity in North America continued to decrease during the st week of March since peaking in early January in Canada and the United States of America (USA) and approximately two weeks later in Mexico. Despite this decrease, influenza activity still remained high in some areas of the region.

In Canada, the percentage of positive influenza tests decreased to 12.2 percent in the 2nd week of March) compared to 35 percent in the 1st week of January. The national influenza-like-illness (ILI) consultation rate also decreased from a peak in late December when it was 36.8 per 1000 patient visits to 23.2 in the 2nd week of March. The number of reported outbreaks in hospitals, long term facilities and schools, decreased from 150 in the 2nd week of January to 24 in the 2nd week of March. Of the 507 influenza viruses detected in the 2nd week of March in Canada, 55.4 percent were identified as influenza A and of those with subtype information, 22.6 percent were A(H3N2) and 20.8 percent were A(H1N1)pdm09. The proportion of positive influenza B appears to have risen relative to influenza A over the past 8 weeks in most areas from 2.1 percent in late January to 55.4 percent in the 2nd week of March, but cumulative seasonal proportions are still much higher for influenza A compared to B. The Aggregated Surveillance System of Canada reported 95 laboratory-confirmed hospitalizations with 65 percent influenza A, predominantly A(H3N2), with the relative proportion of influenza B increased. The highest proportion of hospitalization continued to be in adults above 65 years of age (40 percent). In the same system 271 death have been reported to date and 83 percent (225) were in adults above 65 years of age. Since the start of the season, the National Microbiology Laboratory has antigenically characterized 798 influenza viruses (128 A(H1N1)pdm09, 470 A(H3N2), and 160 influenza B). Of these, all influenza A and influenza B viruses were antigenically similar to the 2012-13 northern hemisphere vaccine viruses, with the exception of 40/160 influenza B viruses which were similar to the B/Brisbane/60/2008 (Victoria lineage) virus; a component of the 2011-2012 seasonal influenza vaccine. So far all viruses tested during this period showed no resistance to oseltamivir (0/730) or zanamivir (0/727).

In the USA, during the 2nd week in March, influenza activity continued to decrease in most areas since peaking in late December to early January. Nationally, the proportion of ILI outpatient consultations is at the national baseline of 2.2 percent. The proportion of clinical ILI specimens testing positive for influenza decreased from the peak of 38 percent in the last week of 2012 to 16.3 percent during the 2nd week of March.

The proportion of all deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza (P&I) reported through the 122 Cities Mortality Reporting System continued to decrease from the peak of 9.8 percent in the 4th week of January, to 7.6 percent in the 2nd week of March. This was still slightly above the epidemic threshold of 7.5 percent. This season's P&I peak represents the 2nd highest level seen in the previous 10 years, with only the 2003-04 influenza season achieving a higher peak (10.4 percent). In addition, 105 influenza-related paediatric deaths were reported so far this season, compared to 34 for the entire season in 2011-12, 122 in 2010-11, and 282 during the winter season of the 2009-10 influenza pandemic. A total of 11 307 laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations were reported since the beginning of the season (cumulative rate of 40.6/100 000 population). This was notably higher than the previous 3 seasons (8.6, 21.4, and 29.0/100 000 population for the 2011-12, 2010-11, 2009-10 seasons respectively). The rate for individuals hospitalized for influenza above 65 years of age was markedly higher than for other age groups, representing 51 percent of all reported cases. The rate for other age groups remained at levels similar to previous years. Among all hospitalizations, 9387 (83.0 percent) were associated with influenza A and 1841 (16.3 percent) with influenza B. Since the start of the season, influenza A(H3N2) viruses have predominated nationally, however in recent weeks, the proportion of influenza B viruses has increased.

During the 2nd week in March, 72 percent of all influenza positive specimens reported were influenza B viruses while 28.1 percent were influenza A. Of the influenza A viruses with subtype information, 34.4 percent were influenza A(H3N2) and 4.7 percent A(H1N1)pdm09. Overall, influenza B viruses were reported more frequently than influenza A viruses in 8 of 10 regions. Cumulatively, the seasonal trend in the United States of America differed from Canada, where 95 percent of the all confirmed specimens were still influenza A.

Since the beginning of the 2012-13 influenza season, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention characterized 1695 influenza viruses antigenically (141 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 1012 influenza A(H3N2), and 542 influenza B viruses). Of these, all influenza A and influenza B viruses were antigenically similar to the 2012-13 northern hemisphere vaccine viruses, with the exception of 159/542 influenza B viruses which belonged to the B/Victoria/02/87 -like lineage. In addition, 0.4 percent (4/1012) of A(H3N2) and 2.1 percent (3/141) of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses tested showed reduced titres with antiserum produced against the A/Victoria/361/2011 and A/California/7/2009 viruses respectively. Since the beginning of the season, none of the influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B viruses tested were resistant to the neuraminidase-inhibitors, oseltamivir and zanamivir. 2 oseltamivir-resistant A(H1N1)pdm09 virus have been reported out of 405 tested in this season. 2 A(H3N2)viruses out of 1577 tested have also been reported oseltamivir-resistant.

Mexico continued to report a decreasing trend in influenza activity over the last few weeks with a majority being influenza A(H3N2). Influenza activity in Mexico appears to have peaked approximately 2 weeks after the USA.

Europe

Influenza activity continued to decline among most parts of the region, while some countries in eastern part of the region still reported increasing activity.

Consultation rates of ILI and acute respiratory infections peaked around the last week of January in western Europe where the season has been unusually long with the proportions of different viruses contributing being different by country and in some countries altering as the season progressed. The proportion of influenza positive sentinel specimens in Europe continued to decrease from previous reports, but remained high at 46 percent (549/1199). The overall peak was seen in the last week of January with 60 percent positivity. In the countries with surveillance for SARI, the weekly number of cases has already peaked, with a few exceptions in the eastern part of the region. Overall, A(H1N1)pdm09 Influenza update | 2 April 2013 4 remained the most commonly detected influenza virus in Europe, however, this pattern has not been uniform across the continent. Of more than 78 000 influenza viruses characterized since the beginning of the season in Europe, 65 percent were influenza A while 35 percent were B. Of the influenza A viruses with subtype information, 70 percent (23 002/32 806) were A(H1N1)pdm09 and 30 percent (9804/32 806)were A(H3N2). However, northern and western countries tended to report the dominance of influenza B or co-circulation of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) and B. In contrast, very little circulation of influenza B was observed in eastern Europe.

During the 2nd week of March some countries in the east showed increasing number of hospitalized adult cases, coinciding with increased flu-positivity rates and increases in ARI/ILI consultation rates. In 15 countries participating in the European Mortality Monitoring Project, similar mortality patterns were reported as in the previous weeks with higher mortality among people aged 65 and older. In most countries excess mortality was considered moderate in comparison to previous years. However in Denmark, the highest increase and longest sustained excess mortality was observed. Of the 4099 influenza A viruses antigenically characterized since the beginning of the season, all A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) were similar to A/California/7/2009 and A/Victoria/361/2011, respectively, which corresponded with the recommendation by WHO for the current northern hemisphere seasonal influenza vaccine. Of the 1136 influenza B viruses antigenically characterised, 85 percent (1361/1594) were belonged to the B/Yamagata/16/88-lineage and 14 percent (218/1594) to the B/Victoria/2/87-linage.

Since the beginning of the season, a total of 967 viruses from 12 countries have been tested for antiviral susceptibility to the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir. 9 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were found to have the neuraminidase H275Y amino acid substitution, causing resistance to oseltamivir. All of 233 influenza A(H3N2) tested showed susceptibility to both drugs. Of the 291 influenza B viruses tested, one virus with reduced inhibition to oseltamivir was detected.

Northern Africa and the eastern Mediterranean region

Across the northern Africa region and the eastern Mediterranean region the number of positive influenza specimens reported has decreased over the past weeks. The peak activity was reached in February in both of these regions. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was the dominant virus in most of northern Africa and the eastern Mediterranean region. In some countries (Bahrain and Jordan) proportionally influenza B has increased in the last weeks.

Northern and Eastern Asia

Influenza activity continued to decrease in much of the temperate region of Asia. In northern China and Japan ILI activity and the percentage of ILI specimens testing positive for influenza virus has declined for approximately 4 weeks. In contrast, ILI activity in Mongolia based on the proportion of outpatients showed continued sustained activity but is still within seasonal tolerance levels. Influenza activity in the Republic of Korea continued to decrease with the number of ILI cases recorded at 9.0 per 1000 patients visits compared to the peak in the beginning of March (week 9) with 12.7 per 1000. As described in previous reports, influenza A(H3N2) has been the most commonly detected virus in most of northern Asia this season.

Northern China also continued to report a decline and the influenza season appears to have ended. During the 2nd week of March, the percentage of specimens that were positive for influenza was 5.6 percent, compared to a peak at around 27 percent in the beginning of January. Among influenza viruses antigenically characterized by the Chinese National Influenza Center since the beginning of the 2012- 13 season, 99.4 percent (173) of influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 viruses were characterized as A/California/7/2009-like and 100 percent (559) of influenza A (H3N2) viruses were A/Victoria/361/2011(H3N2)-like. For influenza B, 100 percent (25) B/Yamagata like viruses were characterized as B/Wisconsin/01/2010-like and 96.7 percent (147) of the B/Victoria like viruses were B/Brisbane/60/2008-like.

Of the influenza viruses tested since October 2012, all A(H1N1)pdm09 and all influenza A(H3N2) viruses were sensitive to the neuraminidase inhibitors and resistant to adamantine while all influenza B viruses were sensitive to neuraminidase inhibitors.

Countries in the tropical zone
------------------------------

Tropical countries of the Americas/Central America and the Caribbean

In both Central America and the Caribbean, influenza activity was similar or decreased compared to previous weeks. Across the region, co-circulation of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and influenza B continued to be reported, with influenza A(H3N2) constituting the majority of the viruses. In general, most ILI and acute respiratory cases were reported to be non-influenza illnesses, with respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus as the most commonly reported causative agent. Cuba continued to report slight activity with co-circulation of all 3 influenza types. In contrast to the previous report, Nicaragua reported noticeably decreased activity since a peak during the last week in February.

In Tropical South America, influenza activity remained low and within expected levels. Ecuador and Peru reported small numbers of influenza B and influenza A(H3N2) respectively.

Central African tropical region

Most countries in the Central African tropical region such as Burkina Faso, Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of Congo, experienced low, but persistent, co-circulation of all 3 influenza viruses over the past several weeks. Kenya continued to report persistent co-circulation of both influenza A viruses, while Madagascar continued to report influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B. Rwanda and the United Republic of Tanzania have reported sharp increases in influenza activity over the past several weeks.

Tropical Asia

Influenza transmission in southern Asia was at low levels. In the 1st week of March, most countries in the region reported either sporadic activity.

In India, co-circulation of A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) was reported unlike the end of February, where A(H1N1)pdm09 was predominant. Sri Lanka continued to report elevated level of influenza activity with no predominant influenza subtype.

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
Influenza activity in all temperate countries of the southern hemisphere is now at inter-seasonal levels
