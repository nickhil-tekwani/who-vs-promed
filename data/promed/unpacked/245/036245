The following information is not as detailed as we would like to give, but
hopefully more detail will follow.
We have information from Health department sources that the cholera outbreak
in Kwa-Zulu-Natal province continues. Notified cases have totalled 1000 to
date, but this is not a final count. A total of 13 deaths have been
attributed to cholera in the province. South African Medical Services
(military medical service) is assisting with treatment of victims, with 290
victims receiving treatment for cholera in a military medical facility at
Empangeni in Kwa-Zulu-Natal.
According to information given at an infection control conference in Durban,
the organism is multi-resistant including to tetracyclines, but is sensitive
to ciprofloxacin.
The outbreak has affected mainly residents of rural areas where water and
sanitation reticulation are not in place. South Africa's urban areas are
reticulated and have potable tap water.
