Part II - Students with atypical pneumonia under treatment
<http://www.info.gov.hk/dh/new/index.htm>
----------------------------------
The Department of Health (DH) on 24 Mar 2003 confirmed that 2 more
students had contracted atypical pneumonia, this brings to 7 the total
number of students infected with the disease.
Consultant in-charge of the Disease Prevention and Control Division of DH,
Dr Tse Lai-yin said they are among the 260 persons confirmed today to have
contracted atypical pneumonia. The first case involved a 17-year-old girl
who is a student of Wa Ying College in Ho Man Tin. She has been feeling
unwell since 10 Mar 2003 and took sick leave since 13 Mar 2003. She was
admitted to Princess Margaret Hospital (PMH) on 22 Mar 2003 for treatment.
Her condition is stable. The second case involved a 13-year-old girl who is
a student of SKH Kei Tak Primary School (AM) in Wong Tai Sin. She has not
attended school since 13 Mar 2003 and developed symptoms on 12 Mar 2003.
She was admitted to PMH on 22 Mar 2003. Her condition is stable.
Meanwhile, DH is also investigating a suspected case in which a 7 year old
girl student, of SKH Kei Tak Primary School (PM) was found to have
developed atypical pneumonia symptoms 23 Mar 2003. She was admitted to
Kwong Wah Hospital today for observation.
As a precaution against atypical pneumonia, Wa Ying College and both the AM
and PM sessions of SKH Kei Tak Primary School, in consultation with DH and
the Education and Manpower Bureau, have decided to close for 7 days until
31 Mar 2003. Investigation is being conducted to ascertain if any of the
girls' close contacts have contracted atypical pneumonia.

Update (11) on SARS cases in Singapore
-------------------
As at 24 Mar 2003, a total of 65 people with SARS have been reported to the
Ministry of Health (MOH). The 14 additional patients reported today
comprise 4 hospital staff and 10 close contacts of patients. Among the
close contacts are 3 siblings (two boys and one girl) aged 17, 13 and 5.
Five patients have been discharged from hospital while the remaining 60
patients are hospitalised. All the patients are stable except for 12
patients who are in serious condition and being treated in the ICU.
Based on the detailed analysis of the 65 cases so far, the evidence is that
SARS is transmitted only when a patient develops the symptoms of the
illness. The incubation period is usually 3-7 days but could be up to 10
days. Epidemiological tracking of the outbreak shows that the initial 3
index cases resulted in 21 primary contacts developing probable SARS. This
latter group of patients in turn have infected a further 41 cases of
probable SARS. While stringent infection control measures have been
instituted, their effect will only be apparent several days later, during
which time we expect further increases in the numbers of SARS cases from
secondary and tertiary transmission.
Since the implementation of the stringent control measures in hospitals,
particularly TTSH/CDC, no new health care workers have been infected. The
new cases of probable SARS involving healthcare workers are still traced
back to the primary contacts.
At present, MOH/NEA officers trace contacts of cases and advise them to see
a doctor in TTSH/CDC immediately if they develop fever or symptoms
suggestive of SARS. In addition, the officers call the contacts every day
to check on their condition. As a further step to reduce the possibility of
transmission from symptomatic contacts to others in the community, MOH will
be instituting home quarantine measures.
Home Quarantine Measures
MOH will be invoking the Infectious Diseases Act to isolate all contacts
who have been exposed to infected SARS patients. They will be required to
stay at home for 10 days and to minimise contact with other people. Those
who do not heed the quarantine requirement are liable for prosecution under
the Act.
During the home quarantine period, NEA officers will be checking with these
contacts daily. If they develop symptoms suggestive of the illness, they
will be immediately referred to CDC and TTSH for further evaluation and
treatment if necessary. If they do not develop any of the symptoms of SARs
after 10 days, they are unlikely to contract SARS.
There are presently more than 300 people on our contact tracing list who
will be quarantined at home. These are mainly family and friends who have
come into close contact with the SARS patients.
MOH will make provisions for those who experience financial difficulties
arising from home quarantine.
Tighter Screening Measures in Schools
The 5-year-old boy is from the Pats School House in Lim Ah Pin Road. As a
precautionary measure, the Ministry of Health has asked Pats School House
to close for 10 days.
The 13 year old girl, a student at Pei Cai Secondary School had limited
contact with her classmates during the school holidays. Although she was
well at that time when she was with her classmates, as a precautionary
measure Pei Cai Secondary School has asked about 200 students who may have
come in contact with her to stay away from school for a week. The 17 year
old boy did not attend school during the school holidays.
WHO has not recommended closure of all schools as cases of transmission are
still confined to those who have been in close contact with infected persons.
To prevent any possible SARS outbreak in childcare centres, pre-schools and
schools, the MOH, Ministry of Education, and Ministry of Community
Development and Sports have tightened screening measures in these places.
Any child with fever will be asked not to attend school, even though they
may not have been in contact with infected persons or had not travelled to
the affected areas. Nurses from the Health Promotion Board will also help
to detect unwell children in childcare centres and kindergartens for early
medical attention.
The Health Advisory to child care centres, kindergartens and schools is
attached at Annex A.
The MOH would like to appeal to all parents whose children have been to
Hong Kong, Guangdong province in China or Hanoi to closely monitor their
children. They should not be sent to school if they have fever and should
be seen by a doctor immediately.
More stringent infection control measures at hospitals
To fully protect visitors, MOH is heeding WHO advice to stop visitations
from family and friends for all SARS patients. At all other hospitals,
patients with fever which may or may not be SARS will be isolated until a
diagnosis is made. All discharges from TTSH from 10 Mar 2003 will also be
added to the contact tracing list for daily surveillance.

Interim Guidelines about Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) For
Airline Flight Crew Members 23 Mar 2003
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/flight_crew_guidelines.htm> "As with all
infectious illnesses, the first line of defense is careful hand hygiene. As
a general rule, it is good practice to wash hands frequently with soap and
water; if no visible soil is present, alcohol-based hand rubs may be used
as an alternative.
If you are concerned that a passenger traveling from Hong Kong and
Guangdong Province, China; or Hanoi, Vietnam, may be seriously ill with a
respiratory illness, you should try to keep him or her separated from the
other passengers as much as possible. You may provide a surgical mask, if
available, for the ill passenger to wear. A surgical mask can reduce the
number of droplets coughed into the air. If a surgical mask is not
available, provide the passenger with tissues and ask him or her to cover
their mouth and nose when coughing. CDC does not recommend the routine use
of masks or other personal protective equipment, such as N95 respirators,
for the flight crew or healthy passengers. However, paying careful
attention to handwashing after contact with the ill passenger is important.
The captain is required by law to report the illness to the nearest U.S.
Quarantine Station. Quarantine officials will arrange for appropriate
medical assistance to be available when the airplane lands."

Update #9 - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 24 Mar 2003 7:00 PM
As of 24 Mar 2003, Health Canada has received reports of 11 individuals who
have become ill with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Ontario
and British Columbia. There have been 3 deaths in Canada. All Canadian
cases have occurred in persons who have traveled to Asia or had contact
with SARS cases in the household or in a health-care setting. The details
of the cases to date are as follows:
Ontario: 10 total cases. To date, all cases have occurred in close family
contacts of travelers returning from Hong Kong or in heath care workers who
have cared for these cases.
British Columbia: one person has been hospitalized with SARS after
returning from travel in southeast Asia.
At this time, the cause of SARS remains unknown, however national and
international laboratory testing and collaboration is ongoing. Here are the
most recent developments:
Health Canada has deployed 3 epidemiologists to assist Toronto Public
Health and the Ontario Ministry of Health with the investigation of SARS
cases currently under investigation.The department has also provided draft
guidelines for infection control and draft recommendations on actions for
public health settings.
Health Canada is ready to respond to any requests for support from
provinces and territories on the SARS issue.
Health Canada issued a revised Travel Advisory on 23 Mar 2003. The overall
risk for travellers appears to be low at this time. However, because of
recent increases in cases of SARS in the City of Hanoi, Vietnam; Hong Kong
SAR; and Singapore and that transmission may not be limited to the hospital
setting, Health Canada advises that persons planning elective or
nonessential travel to the City of Hanoi, Vietnam; Hong Kong SAR; and
Singapore may wish to postpone their trips until further notice. For
further information on this travel advisory, please see:

Scientists at Health Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) in
Winnipeg are now able to report that they have found evidence of human
metapneumovirus (hMPV) in specimens from 6 of the 8 cases they are
studying. The metapneumovirus is part of paramyxoviridae family. These
findings are consistent with the results previously released by scientists
in Germany and Hong Kong.
The findings of the NML are significant in that a common thread has been
found in a majority of cases in Canada. This is a promising step in the
ongoing investigation. Scientists will continue their work to try to verify
the findings and to determine if there are other factors involved that are
influencing the severity of this outbreak. These findings will not likely
alter the current treatment for SARS patients. For more information on
hMPV, please see Health Canada's Qs & As:

Health Canada has initiated the following activities:
Health Canada is providing epidemiological expertise and laboratory support
to provinces/territories and hospitals involved in managing the SARS cases.
Health Canada is chairing five Working Groups made up of
federal/provincial/territorial and public health officials, as well as
other community-based experts dealing with such issues as infection
control, treatment guidelines and public health measures.
Health Canada is in daily contact with the provinces and territories, the
World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centre for Disease Control (CDC).
We have expanded health alert card distribution at major airports in
Canada. In addition to Pearson and Vancouver, these cards are available at
all airports that receive international flights from all destinations other
than the United States.
In collaboration with the provinces, territories, and local health units,
Health Canada is leading enhanced surveillance activities for the
recognition of SARS cases.
Health Canada has also asked officials at the Pearson and Vancouver
International Airports to carefully monitor passengers arriving from Hong
Kong and Singapore to see if anyone has flu-like symptoms.
Health Canada has sent staff to Pearson and Vancouver International
Airports to support airport staff. Health professionals have been sent to
each airport to help monitor passengers arriving on direct flights from
Hong Kong and Singapore for flu-like symptoms and to assist those who
appear to be ill.
They have started distributing Health Alert Notices to all passengers
arriving in or returning from Hong Kong and Singapore which will ask
passengers to see a physician if they begin to have any symptoms related to
SARS. These symptoms include a fever over 38.0 degrees Celsius AND one or
more of the following respiratory symptoms: cough, shortness of breath or
difficulty breathing.
Health Canada's Workplace Health and Public Safety Programme is providing
advice to federal employers on occupational health and safety matters.
Health professionals from Health Canada's Workplace Health and Public
Safety Programme were on site at the Pearson and Vancouver airports to
provide information sessions for federal employees. They are available, at
the employer's request, to provide sessions for federal employees at all
airports that receive international flights from all destinations other
than the United States. The Workplace Health and Safety Programme has
issued an advisory and has spoken to or met with representatives of a
number of federal departments to provide them with information and advice
they can use in determining what health and safety measures they deem
appropriate for their employees. It is Health Canada's position that
Government of Canada workers are not considered to be at high risk of
infection because of the limited contact with and proximity to the
individuals. Therefore, Health Canada advises that the use of masks is not
necessary. Health Canada continues to provide employer departments with the
most current information and advice available on SARS.
The information contained in this update is based on the best available
information Health Canada has at this time.
For additional information on SARS, please contact Health Canada's
information line at: 1-800-454-8302.

[A] Vietnam from Reuters 24 Mar 2003
11:29 <http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/HAN42827>
Doctors at the Vietnam-France Hospital, where the outbreak in Vietnam's
capital began, said a 43-year-old Vietnamese nurse who worked at the
facility and who was one of three patients there in critical condition,
died on Monday afternoon.
[She is the third death reported from VietNam, the other 2 were a nurse and
a physician]. All 3 medical staff were apparently exposed to the virus
after treating a U.S. businessman who was admitted with flu-like symptoms
at the end of February 2003 and later died in Hong Kong where he had been
taken for treatment.

First suspected case of SARS in Macau
--------
A 25 year old British teacher is suspected of having SARS and is being
treated. Officials from the Macau Centre for Disease Control and Prevention
stated that specimen samples of the teacher have been sent to the Hong Kong
labs
for analysis.
Officials explained that the teacher went to Hong Kong on 10 Mar 2003 for
the day and spent the day shopping
and did not go to any of the hospitals in Hong Kong. The teacher was in
Hong Kong for more than 10 hours and returned to Macau on the same day.
[Before drawing any conclusions that this is a community-acquired case of
SARS, we await official word on the diagnosis and investigation of the
above mentioned suspected case. As a reminder, SARS is not the only
etiology of pneumonia, and at present, many cases acute respiratory
syndrome are considered suspected cases of SARS that are later shown to
have another etiology and therefore ruled out as due to SARS. - Mod.MPP]
[C] Hong Kong from the International Herald Tribune 24 Mar 2003
<http://www.iht.com/articles/90827.html>
The chief of Hong Kong's hospitals was hospitalized Monday with severe
pneumonia symptoms, suggestive he has SARS.

Noteworthy in this update is the implementation of "home quarantine" by the
Singapore Ministry of Health which has lead to significant press
coverage. According to information available, to date, all cases in
Singapore have been related to close contact with other SARS patients in
either the health care/hospital setting or family or close friends of
cases. In the absence of evidence of generalized community spread, one
wonders why these measures were taken. We await further information on
this. - Mod.MPP]
