The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has said that about 189 deaths were recorded in the country in 2022 from Lassa fever

Also, 63 healthcare workers were infected by the disease in the year under review.

According to the situation report released yesterday [7 Jan 2022] by the Centre, confirmed cases for the last [epi week of] 2022 stand at 1067 across 112 Local Government Areas and 27 states.

The report showed that 72 per cent of all confirmed Lassa fever cases were reported from the 3 states of Ondo, Edo, and Bauchi while 23 per cent were reported from 24 states with confirmed Lassa fever cases.

It further revealed that of the 72 per cent of confirmed cases, Ondo State reported 33 per cent, Edo 25 per cent, and Bauchi 14 per cent.

The 52nd-week report from 26 Dec 2022 to 1 Jan 2023, showed that the suspected cases were 8202.

The report read in part, "In week 52, the number of new confirmed cases decreased from 17 in week 51, 2022, to 12 cases. These were reported from Edo, Ebonyi, and Benue States.

"Cumulatively from week 1 to week 52, 2022, 189 deaths have been reported with a case fatality rate of 17.7 per cent which is lower than the CFR for the same period in 2021 (20.0 per cent).

"In total for 2022, 27 States have recorded at least one confirmed case across 112 Local Government Areas. The predominant age group affected is 21-30 years (range: 1 to 90 years, median age: 30 years). The male-to-female ratio for confirmed cases is 1:0.8.".

"The number of suspected cases has increased compared to that reported for the same period in 2021. No new healthcare worker was affected in reporting week 52.

[The] "National Lassa fever multi-partner, multi-sectoral Technical Working Group continues to coordinate the response activities at all levels."

According to the World Health Organisation, Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Benin, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Sierra Leone, Togo, and Nigeria, but probably exists in other West African countries as well.

[There were 12 new confirmed Lassa fever (LF) cases in week 52 (26 Dec 2022 to 1 Jan 2023,), indicating that LF virus transmission has been continuing at a relatively low level. There were 189 total deaths in 2022. No newly infected healthcare workers were reported in week 52 but there were 63 healthcare workers infected during 2022.

The report above confirms that Edo, Ondo, and Bauchi states have the most confirmed cases. 27 states were affected in 2022, and the number of local government areas (LGAs) with at least one case is 112.

Nigeria is now in a period where case numbers have declined and remain stable at relatively low levels. Case numbers are likely to continue to remain relatively low for another month and then rise until about weeks 11-13 (March 2023) if the usual pattern occurs as it has in recent years.

Transmission of LF virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir host excreta or are within healthcare facilities. It is encouraging to learn from this and previous reports that risk communications and community engagement activities have been scaled up across states in Nigeria using television, radio, print, social media, and other strategies for avoidance of contact with rodent virus reservoirs and their excreta.

One hopes that the ongoing public information campaign will help the local population avoid the entry of these reservoir rodents into their houses and other buildings. - Mod.TY
