Human monkeypox is a severe systemic exanthem, clinically similar to
smallpox. It is a rare sporadic zoonosis caused by monkeypox virus, an
orthopoxvirus enzootic in mammals including monkeys and squirrels, in the
rainforest of western and central Africa (1). Between February and August
1996, 71 cases of human monkeypox were reported from 13 villages in the
Katako-Kombe health zone, Sankuru subregion, Kasai Oriental, Democratic
Republic of Congo (2,3). A preliminary investigation in 1996 found that 42
clinically defined cases had occurred in the village of Akungula where
squirrels are often hunted.
In a second investigation organised by the World Health Organization (WHO),
92 suspect cases resident in the Katako-Kombe zone with disease onset from
February 1996 to February 1997 were identified (4). Monkeypox virus (MPV)
was subsequently isolated in culture from scabs or vesicular fluid from
most of the active cases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
Atlanta. This was the largest outbreak of monkeypox on record, and was
associated with less severe clinical disease than previously observed.
Distinguishing the role of primary and secondary transmission mechanisms in
this continuous outbreak is critical to development of more effective
intervention strategies, determining whether the disease can sustain itself
without repeated introduction from reservoir animals, and for consideration
of reintroduction of vaccinia vaccination, which is highly effective
against monkeypox.
Continuing reports of active cases following large internal population
movements through a large area of Kasai Oriental during March and April
1997, led to a third investigation being organised by WHO. The mission's
objectives were to assess the size of the outbreak, collect specimens,
determine risk factors for disease transmission and recommend appropriate
control measures. This report summarises the preliminary results of this
third investigation.
Methods
Cases were actively sought in the Katako-Kombe and Lodja health care zones
of Kasai Oriental using similar definitions for possible and probable cases
to those used in the second mission (4). A probable case of monkeypox was
defined as the occurrence since February 1996 in a resident of Kasai
Oriental zone of fever and a vesicular-pustular rash similar to a WHO
reference photograph. A possible case was the occurrence since February
1996 of fever and vesicular or crusty rash in a resident of Kasai Oriental.
A primary case was defined as a case with no reported contact episode with
another case and a secondary case an individual with a contact episode in
the seven to 21 days before disease onset. To assess risk factors for
infection, a case control and a retrospective cohort study were conducted.
The secondary attack rate in the compound was estimated by dividing the
number of first generation secondary s by the total number of susceptible
household contacts within the cohort. Serum was collected from over 300 of
the cases and crusted scabs and vesicular fluid from 14 cases with active
disease. These data and specimens are currently being analysed.
Results
Four hundred and nineteen cases were identified, 344 of which were from the
Katako Kombe health zone (attack rate, [AR 1.1/1000) and 75 from the Lodja
health zone (AR 0.3/1000) who developed disease between February 1996 and
October 1997. Three hundred and four cases met the probable case definition
and 115 the possible. Nineteen cases had active disease. Preliminary
testing of material from lesions identified MPV in nine cases and varicella
zoster virus in four. Fifty-five per cent of the 344 cases resident in the
Katako-Kombe zone were male (AR males 1.3/1000, AR females 0.9/1000).
Eighty-five per cent of cases were under 16 years of age.
Twenty of the 344 cases (6%) had scar evidence of vaccinia vaccination and
19 reported a past history of chickenpox. The rash was moderate (100-250
skin lesions) or severe (more than 250 skin lesions) in 31% of cases and
41% stated that the eruption lasted longer than one week. Ninety-eight per
cent of these cases reported fever, 11% diarrhoea, 41% cough, 69% cervical
lymphadenopathy, 63% sore throat, and 50% mouth ulcers. Fifty-four per cent
of cases were incapacitated for more than three days. Five cases, aged 4 to
8 years died (case fatality ratio 1.5%) within three weeks of the onset of
rash. Two cases were found with corneal opacities and six with alopecia.
Five hundred and eleven cases with onset of disease between February 1996
and October 1997 were identified (figure). In the Katako-Kombe and Lodja
health zones by combining the data from the two missions, were (figure).
Two peaks of cases were observed in August 1996 and August 1997 (figure).
Cases lived in 54 villages in the Katako-Kombe zone and 24 in the Lodja
zone. The largest AR was observed in Akungula (AR 113/1000, population
399), the epicentre of the outbreak in August 1996. The highest number of
cases were subsequently reported from Ekanga, an adjacent village (54 cases
clustered in 13 compounds, AR 43/1000). The peak of the outbreak in Ekanga
and the two nearby villages of Ombeka (21 cases, AR 22/1000) and Dimanga (7
cases, AR 20/1000) occurred in March 1997. The subsequent peak in August
1997 represented cases resident in other villages.
Twenty-two per cent of the 419 cases identified during the third mission
were primary, and the remainder were defined as secondary. The age and sex
distribution of primary and secondary cases were not significantly
different. Forty-eight per cent of these secondary cases reported contact
with another case in the compound, 42% in the household, and 53% in the
neighbourhood (some had more than one contact). Primary cases with no
apparent connection to the Akungula/Ekanga cluster were reported from 49 of
the total 78 villages where cases were found. Thirty-five per cent of the
419 cases reported being outside their home village in the three weeks
before becoming ill. Within a cohort of 320 contacts of index cases in the
compound, a range of 30 to 39 first generation secondary cases occurred
(some secondary cases could be classified as co-primary or tertiary due to
missing values), a secondary household attack rate of 9% to 12%.
Discussion
This third investigation was undertaken to answer questions arising from
the earlier missions and to investigate the reports of continuing disease
transmission. This is the largest reported outbreak of suspected monkeypox,
with cases found over a large area of the Katako-Kombe and Lodja zones.
Transmission seems now to have ceased at the epicentre of the outbreak and
the immediate surrounding villages. Human cases detected more recently are
occurring in more geographically distant clusters, most with no apparent
link to the original outbreak. These cases of sporadic transmission may be
due to independent introductions of the virus into the human population
associated with animal contact.
Clinical disease was milder than reported in the 1980s, when the case
fatality rate approached 10% compared with 1.5% currently. Preliminary
calculations of secondary attack rates yielded similar results to those
observed among unvaccinated contacts in the 1980s (9-12%) (1). The apparent
alteration in transmission dynamics may be due to an increase in the number
of susceptible individuals due to the cessation of the smallpox vaccination
programme, or a change in other factors related to transmissibility. The
highly sensitive case definition recruited cases with other causes for a
vesicular rash illness, such as varicella-zoster. A more specific case
definition based on the results of analysis of biological specimens and
clinical data will reduce this misclassification. In addition analysis of
the case control and cohort studies will elucidate risk factors for person
to person and animal to human transmission.
In view of the apparent cessation of new cases at the epicentre and with
laboratory results pending, the findings at present do not warrant the
reintroduction of vaccinia vaccine. This could potentially protect the
populations at highest risk of infection, but must be considered carefully
because of the risk of severe vaccine related adverse events particularly
in those infected with HIV (5). Continuing surveillance and local disease
control measures have been recommended to monitor and limit the risk of
primary and secondary spread of infection. These include limiting care of
active cases to a person who has received smallpox vaccine or previously
had monkeypox, restricting cases from playing, eating, or sleeping with
others during active disease, and avoiding handling dead or diseased wild
animals. The need for other risk reduction measures will depend on the
results of this continuing surveillance.
