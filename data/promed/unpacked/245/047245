The EHD virus, the Epizootic Haemorrhagic Disease of the Deer, has been identified in Sardinia. EHD is a disease similar to Blue tongue and affects ruminants. The pathogen, which spreads through culicoid insects, has been identified in some cattle from farms located in Southern Sardinia. The discovery, by the territorial veterinary services, was confirmed by the National Reference Center for Exotic Diseases of Teramo and was at the center of the regional summit that met today [9 Nov 2022]. The meeting was attended by technicians of the Regional Health Department and the Experimental Zooprophylactic Institute of Sardinia in connection with technicians of the Ministry of Health and the Reference Center of Teramo.

This is the 1st EHD outbreak detected in Europe. It has already been present for some time in North Africa, from which it could have arrived carried by insects transported to the island by the winds of the desert. "The detection of the virus" -- explains the regional health councilor, Mario Nieddu -- "once again highlights the capacity of our surveillance and monitoring system on diseases and epidemiological risk. Control measures have already started, addressing animals and insects, to verify the presence of the virus beyond the area of the outbreak."

While waiting for more epidemiological information from additional tests, the Ministry of Health has ordered a total ban on movements of cattle, the species most susceptible to this virus, out and within the island's territory, for a period of 3 to 4 weeks. Cattle suffers from EHD, clinically, more than sheep and other susceptible species. The movements of sheep and other ruminants which may act as reservoirs of EHD virus, have been stopped as well. At this moment no vaccine against EHD is available.

"Undoubtedly the situation has become delicate due to the presence of a virus about which little is known yet. The level of information becoming available to the authorities about the spread of the virus, is conditional for the decision about the time and mode to moderate the movement restrictions or to terminate them".

[Epizootic haemorrhagic disease (EHD) is caused by a virus of the family Reoviridae, genus Orbivirus; there are 8 or more serotypes and Ibaraki virus is a member of the EHD virus (EHDV) serogroup (serotype 2). EHDV demonstrates immunological cross reactivity with the Bluetongue virus group. The disease was added to WOAH's list in 2008, following its introduction into North African and West Asian territories, demonstrating its transboundary spread capacity and challenging Europe. EHDV is not zoonotic.

EHD is a vector-borne infectious noncontagious viral disease of domestic and wild ruminants, primarily white-tailed deer, other cervids and cattle. Sheep, goats and camelids might also be susceptible, but usually do not develop overt disease.

EHDV is transmitted between ruminant hosts by species of _Culicoides_ biting midges, thus infections are strongly seasonal. White-tailed deer is the most severely affected species, with the peracute form having a high mortality rate. In cattle, clinical signs include fever, anorexia, dysphagia, emaciation, ulcerative stomatitis, lameness, respiratory distress and erythema of the udder. Different severity levels have been observed, assumed to be related to the susceptibility of the animal breeds and the pathogenicity of the strains/serotype(s) involved.

As a vector-borne viral disease, the distribution of EHD is limited to the distribution of competent _Culicoides_ vectors. EHDV has been isolated from wild and domestic ruminants and arthropods in North America, Ecuador, the Caribbean region, French Guiana, Asia, Africa and Australia, and more recently in countries along the southern and eastern shores of the Mediterranean Basin including Algeria, Israel, Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia, and Turkey. No cases of EHDV infection have been reported in Europe prior to the current event in Sardinia, suspected to be introduced by windborne infected _Culicoides_ from the Maghreb. Outbreaks generally coincide with the peak of vector population abundance, so most cases of EHD occur in the late summer and autumn.

As EHDV is a vector-borne infection it may be difficult to control or eradicate once established. Unpredicted and uncontrollable variables such as climatic and geographical factors, as well as abundance of suitable EHDV insect vectors are all important for the outcome and persistence (or reappearance) of EHDV in an area. Furthermore, to date, there is little information on the effect of control measures applied in the countries where the disease has affected cattle. EHDV-infected animals must be controlled for the period of viraemia and protected against _Culicoides_.

So far, no commercial vaccines against EHD have become available. An experimental vaccine against EHDV, serotypes 2 and 6, in deer in Missouri, USA, is undergoing evaluation (https://medgenelabs.com/ehd/).

Some of the above and additional, updated information about EHV is available in WOAH's Terrestrial Manual chapter 3.01.07, at https://www.woah.org/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.01.07_EHD.pdf, and in WOAH's EHD Technical disease card, available at https://www.woah.org/app/uploads/2021/03/epizootic-heamorrhagic-disease.pdf.

Reference laboratories for EHD are located in the UK (Pirbright), Italy (Teramo) and France (Maisons-Alfort).

Ecomomic aspects of EHD in dairy cattle have been addressed in the following paper: Kedmi M., Van Straten M., Ezra E., Galon N., Klement E. (2010). Assessment of the productivity effects associated with epizootic hemorrhagic disease in dairy herds. Journal of Dairy Science 93 (6), 2486-2495. https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2009-2850.

"Abstract
Recent outbreaks of epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) in North Africa, Israel, and Turkey increase the risk of its invasion into central and northern Europe. An outbreak of EHDV in Israel during the fall of 2006 enabled an assessment of the consequent production losses to the dairy cattle industry. Reduction in milk production and involuntary culling were modeled using a 4-yr database of monthly milk and mortality records from 48 affected and 63 unaffected herds. These indices were compared between periods of outbreak and no outbreak and assessed for various levels and exposure onset. Geospatial kriging interpolation of serological results from 127 herds was used to assess the total outbreak losses for the dairy cattle industry in Israel. Herds affected during the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd month of the outbreak (September-November 2006) experienced an average loss of 207 (95% CI = 154-261), 137 (63-211), and 52 (27-76) kg of milk/milking cow, respectively, during the outbreak period. An average excess mortality and involuntary culling of 1.47/100 cows was documented in herds affected in September 2006. High correlation was observed between EHDV seroprevalence and milk loss; average milk loss for herds with seropositivity of 26 to 50, 51 to 75, and 76 to 100% was 84, 133, and 204 kg of milk/milking cow, respectively. A 1.42% (0.91-1.93%) increase in mortality was observed in herds with seroprevalence above 50%. Losses for the dairy cattle industry interpolated from these data were estimated at US$2,491,000 (US$1,591,000-3,391,000), an average loss of US$26.5/cow in the Israeli dairy cattle. This equals 0.55% of the average total value production of a dairy cow in Israel. This is the first study to estimate the production losses caused by EHDV or any bluetongue-like disease."

The above assessment includes information which may be taken into consideration when measures to control EHV in Sardinia and prevent its further spread in Europe are discussed.

The serotyping results from Tunisia and Sardinia are anticipated with interest. - Mod.AS
