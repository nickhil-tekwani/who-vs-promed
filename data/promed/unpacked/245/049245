F.B.I. Details Anthrax Case, but Doubts Remain
----------------------------------------------
Federal Bureau of Investigation (F.B.I.) officials on Monday [1 Aug
2008] laid out their most detailed scientific case to date against
Bruce E. Ivins, the military scientist accused of being the anthrax
killer, but they acknowledged that the many mysteries of the case
meant an air of uncertainty would always surround it.

"I don't think we're ever going to put the suspicions to bed," said
Vahid Majidi, head of the F.B.I.'s weapons of mass destruction
division. "There's always going to be a spore on a grassy knoll. At a
2-hour briefing for reporters, Dr. Majidi was joined by 7 other
leading scientists from inside and outside the bureau. They discussed
in intricate detail the halting scientific path that led them from 2
main samples of anthrax used in the 2001 attacks, to 4 genetic
mutations unique to the samples, to 100 scientists in the United
States who had access to that particular strain, and ultimately to Dr. Ivins.

At the briefing, F.B.I. officials disclosed that they 1st obtained a
sample of a unique strain of anthrax from Dr. Ivins in 2002, one that
could have led them back to the strain used in the 2001 attacks. But
the bureau destroyed the sample because Dr. Ivins did not follow
protocol in the way it was submitted, making it more difficult to use
in court. It was not until 2006, after a backup copy of Dr. Ivins's
sample was found by another scientist [Paul Keim, NASU, Flagstaff]
working with the F.B.I., that the bureau's scientists realized it was
the same strain used in the anthrax mailings. That crucial finding
helped confirm other evidence pointing to Dr. Ivins.

"Looking at it in hindsight," Dr. Majidi said of the misstep in 2002,
"we would do things differently today."

The 2001 mailings, sent to 2 senators and several prominent media
figures, killed 5 people and sickened 17. F.B.I. officials said on
Monday that they were still uncertain of the paths by which some of
the victims came into contact with the anthrax. But they said they
believed that the anthrax was naturally fine enough to seep through
the envelopes used in the attacks and that mail sorting equipment
dispersed it into the air at several postal processing facilities. 2
postal workers in Washington, DC, were among those killed.

They also countered a principal scientific criticism of the
investigation: that the spores had been weaponized with a special
coating and therefore could not have been made by Dr. Ivins because
he did not have the necessary equipment. This criticism is based on
the presence of silica in the anthrax-laced attack letters. However,
the F.B.I. scientists said that the silica had been imported
naturally by the anthrax spores from their environment and that there
was no evidence of weaponization.

By June 2002, the Institute for Genomic Research had decoded the full
DNA of several strains of anthrax, showing that it might be possible
to link the attack strain to its source through diagnostic changes in
the DNA. It took another year to identify the 4 most distinctive of
these changes, or mutations. Meanwhile, the F.B.I. collected 1000
samples of the Ames strain of anthrax, the especially deadly kind
used in the attacks, and started to apply its genetic test to them.

The evidence was soon pointing to Fort Detrick as the likely source
of the attack strain, and an anomaly then appeared. A 2nd sample
submitted by Dr. Ivins later in 2002, which should have carried the
Fort Detrick signature, did not, the officials said. This led the
F.B.I. to conclude that the 2nd sample he had submitted was falsely
labeled. Eventually, 8 of the 1000 strains were found to carry the 4
mutations, and 100 scientists had access to, or were associated with,
the strains. All of these scientists were investigated. The "body of
evidence," officials said, pointed to Dr. Ivins.

Richard O. Spertzel, a retired microbiologist who led the United
Nations' biological weapons inspections of Iraq, said he remained
skeptical of the bureau's argument despite the new evidence. "It's a
pretty tenuous argument," Dr. Spertzel said in an interview, adding
that he questioned the bureau's claim that the powder was less than
military grade.

The F.B.I. scientists said they had been able to reverse-engineer the
production and properties of the attack spores, producing bacteria
that flew into the air with ease. One person could have prepared the
attack anthrax in 3 to 7 days, with equipment available at Fort
Detrick, a bureau expert said. The F.B.I. had been unable to
reproduce one feature of the attack spores -- their high level of
silica -- but attributed that to natural variability.

Dr. Spertzel said the failure to reproduce the silica content "raises
more questions." But he added that if the F.B.I. was right and "an
individual can make that kind of product, just by drying it, we are
in deep trouble as a nation and a world."

[The Armed Forces Institute of Pathology reported finding silicon in
the letter product. At this meeting it was clarified. Joseph Michael
at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico, convinced
the FBI that silicon had not been added to the anthrax spores in the
letters. Although preliminary analysis done at the Armed Forces
Institute of Pathology had indicated the presence of silicon,
transmission electron microscopy by Michael and his colleagues
revealed that the silicon was contained inside the spores -- a
natural occurrence documented in previous research -- rather than a
coating intended to make the anthrax more easily dispersible. However
as the contents of the flask in Ivin's laboratory appears to lack
this high level of silicon, one might presume that it was acquired in
a subsequent subculturing of an aliquot from said flask with all the
markers. How else would it get inside the spores? Possibly by being
cultured on a high silicon containing growth medium? As there was
more than enough spore slurry in the flask for any dry spore
production, one must query why anyone would want to waste 2-3 days
culturing instead of just getting on with it. By the logic of the
investigation if an extra-flask spore slurry had been used, it would
not have contained the 4 markers.

The LA Times described the contents of flask RMR 1029 as follows (see
above link): "The parent material for the anthrax mailings -- the one
flask of RMR 1029 -- was derived from a mixture of various batches of
spores, originally totaling 164 liters, said Chris Hassell, a chemist
who since June 2008 has headed the FBI's laboratory. Hassell said
that Ivins produced RMR 1029 from spores shipped from 22 "production
runs" at Ft. Detrick and from 13 runs received there from the
government's Dugway Proving Ground in Utah." Such a mixture would
have tended to the mean silicon concentration of the 2 contributing institutes.

A lawyer who had represented Ivins, Paul F. Kemp, said after the
briefings that he remained unconvinced by the government's rollout of
scientific information, which began 6 Aug 2008. "This is an
ever-evolving script that they are writing," he said in an interview.
We await the next revelation. It should be noted that the FBI has not
closed the book on this investigation. It is ongoing and therefore
the investigation documents are not available for inspection.
