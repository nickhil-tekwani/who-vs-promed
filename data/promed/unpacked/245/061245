A salmonella outbreak on 19 poultry farms has resulted in the cull of 850 000 birds.

While a statement from the Department of Agriculture said that officials were cautiously optimistic that the worst of the outbreak was over, they had no comment on whether the disease had resulted in any human illness.

"There is no food safety risk arising from this _Salmonella enteriditis_ outbreak, as all (19) infected flocks have been subject to appropriate controls," it said in a statement. It added that there appeared to be 2 clusters of infected farms, and that these "appear not to be related."

All 3 of the main chicken processors south of the border have been affected.

Manor Farm's Managing director, Vincent Carton, said that processors would be "taking the hit," but he admitted that some of his growers had still to be compensated for their depopulated birds. He insisted that the cull would not have any impact on the supply of Irish chicken, which is running a typical weekly kill of 1.5 million birds.

IFA poultry chairman Nigel Renehan, who was one of the farmers affected, said that he was "seriously distraught" with the disease pressures that the industry was under.

"We know that we have a problem with diseases like camplyobacter, and we know that the Minister for Agriculture wants it sorted," said Mr Renehan, who farms in Monaghan. "But it would take 10c [USD 0.11] extra per bird to upgrade facilities on farms. We've asked for it, but nobody is interested. It's a real mess, because it's just not in it anymore. I'd shut the houses in the morning if I could, but I've got borrowings to service on them. Many are in the same boat as me," said the downbeat farm leader.

While investigations into the source of the outbreak are ongoing, many of the infected birds are linked with a consignment of chicks from a hatchery in Wrexham in Britain.

[Salmonellosis is an infectious disease of humans and animals. Although primarily intestinal bacteria, salmonellae are widespread in the environment and commonly found in farm effluents, human sewage and in any material subject to faecal contamination.

The great majority of Salmonella infections in humans are food-borne with _Salmonella enteritidis_ and _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium_ accounting for a major part of the problem. Salmonella serotypes and prevalence may vary considerably between localities, districts, regions and countries, and, therefore, surveillance and identification of the prevalent Salmonella serotypes in humans and poultry should be carried out in order to develop a control programme for the area.

In most food animal species, Salmonella can establish a clinically inapparent infection of variable duration, which is significant as a potential zoonosis. Such animals may be important in relation to the spread of infection between flocks and as causes of human food-borne infection. In the latter case, this can occur when meat and eggs, or their products, enter the food chain, thus producing contaminated food.

Salmonella organisms may also be found in animal feedstuffs, causing subclinical gastro-intestinal carriage or infectious disease in animals, particularly poultry and pigs.

Salmonellosis has been recognised in all countries but appears to be most prevalent in areas of intensive animal husbandry, especially in pigs and calves and some types of poultry reared in confinement. Reptiles are commonly subclinical carriers of Salmonella. Several serovars are host specific (e.g. _S. abortusovis_ in sheep or _S. typhi_ in humans) or host adapted (e.g. _S. choleraesuis_ in pigs and _S. dublin_ in cattle).

The disease can affect all species of domestic animals; young animals and pregnant and lactating animals are the most susceptible. Enteric disease is the commonest clinical manifestation, but a wide range of clinical signs, which include acute septicaemia, abortion, arthritis and respiratory disease, may be seen in mammal animals and, less common, in poultry (re. sheep, see Mod.TG's commentary in 20130828.1907222). Many animals, especially pigs and poultry, may also be infected but show no clinical illness. Such animals may be important in relation to the spread of infection between flocks and herds and as sources of food contamination and human infection.

_S. enteritidis_ was the major cause of the global food-borne salmonellosis outbreak in humans between 1990-2010, during which contaminated hen's eggs were the most important vehicle of the infection. Eggs can be contaminated on the outer shell surface and internally. A review is available at http://femsre.oxfordjournals.org/content/33/4/718.full-text.pdf.

Though salmonellosis is not included in OIE's list of notifiable diseases, due to its zoonotic impact special guidelines and technical information (diagnostic methods, vaccines manufacture and testing) have been included in OIE's Terrestrial Code and Terrestrial Manual, as follows:

1. Terrestrial Animal Health Code (section on Veterinary public health, chapter 6.5) , titled "Prevention, detection and control of Salmonella in poultry", available at http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_prevent_salmonella.htm.

2. Terrestrial Manual, chapter 2.09.09: http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.09.09_SALMONELLOSIS.pdf.

Official National schemes have been implemented in many countries to control Salmonella infections in animals in order to protect the consumer. In the European Union (EU), the Zoonoses Directive 2003/99/EC requires the monitoring of breeding flocks of more than 250 birds and hatcheries for _S. Enteritidis_ and _S. Typhimurium_ and slaughter of positive flocks. In further legislation _S. Virchow_, _S. Infantis_ and _S. Hadar_ are also subject to special controls.

Various inactivated vaccines are used against salmonellosis caused by different serovars in various animal species, including a combined _S. Enteritidis_ and _S. Typhimurium_ vaccine for use in poultry. - Mod.AS
