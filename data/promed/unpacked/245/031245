Deadly bug in Palace water
---------------------------
Traces of the bacterium that causes Legionnaires' disease have been
found in the water supply at Buckingham Palace. A Palace spokesman
said engineers took a week to flush the bug out of the water system, and
the Royal Family were not affected.
More than 300 staff were warned to be on the alert for symptoms of the
illness, which can spread through a building's water system. The bug
was found in one section of the water supply, which was isolated so the
rest of the Palace could carry on as normal, the spokesman said.
"Legionnaires' disease [sic] was discovered in the water supply on 13
October 1998 after routine tests," he said. "It was dealt with immediately
in the normal way by flushing out the system. "Another sample was taken
and 10 days later the all-clear was given."
There are up to 200 cases of Legionnaires' disease each year with
between 10 and 40 deaths in England and Wales. More than two-thirds of
cases occur in people over 50.
