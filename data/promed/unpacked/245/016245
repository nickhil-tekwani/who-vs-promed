The cronut burger was the culprit behind a massive food poisoning outbreak at the Canadian National Exhibition [CNE, The Ex] this week [week of 20 Aug 2013], Toronto Public Health confirmed. Dr David McKeown, the city's chief medical officer of health, blamed the burger for getting around 150 people ill at the Ex on Tue 20 Aug 2013. "The cronut burger is the only food that was common to the people that became ill and laboratory tests have identified the _Staphylococcus aureus_ [entero]toxin in samples of the cronut burger, so yes, we believe it is the source of the outbreak," McKeown told reporters.

The outbreak started with around a dozen people being treated by paramedics on site at the CNE Tuesday night [20 Aug 2013] -- 5 of those people had to be taken to hospital. Of the 150 people who reported to public health that they got ill after eating food at the CNE, around 100 have already been interviewed.

"Based on the information from the ill individuals, the only common food exposure that they had was the cronut burger served by Epic Burgers," McKeown said. "_Staphylococcus aureus_ [entero] toxin is a recognized cause of foodborne illness. The _S. aureus_ bacterium produces a toxin which can cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea within 2 to 4 hours of ingestion."

The bacterium wasn't on the list of ingredients in the headline-grabbing hamburger, which beyond the beef includes 2 cronuts (a cross between a donut and a croissant), processed cheese and a maple bacon jam topping. Now public health will be testing all the different parts of the burger to determine which part contained the bacterium.

[Classical food poisoning due to _Staphylococcus aureus_ presents with a short incubation period of 4-6 hours as acute nausea and vomiting, usually without fever or diarrhea. The illness generally lasts less than 24 hours.

The following information regarding this entity is extracted from the USA FDA's Bad Bug Book at http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/CausesOfIllnessBadBugBook/ucm070015.htm.

In the diagnosis of staphylococcal foodborne illness, proper interviews with the victims and the gathering and analyzing of epidemiological data, are essential. Incriminated foods should be collected and examined for staphylococci. The presence of relatively large numbers of enterotoxigenic staphylococci is good circumstantial evidence that the food contains toxin. The most conclusive test is the linking of an illness with a specific food, or, in cases where multiple vehicles exist, the detection of the toxin in the food sample(s).

In cases where the food may have been treated to kill the staphylococci, as in pasteurization or heating, direct microscopic observation of the food may be an aid in the diagnosis. A number of serological methods for determining the enterotoxigenicity of _S. aureus_ isolated from foods, as well as methods for the separation and detection of toxins in foods have been developed, and used successfully, to aid in the diagnosis of the illness. Phage typing may also be useful when viable staphylococci can be isolated from the incriminated food, from victims, and from suspected carriers, such as food handlers.

A toxin dose of less than 1.0 microgram in contaminated food will produce symptoms of staphylococcal intoxication. This toxin level is reached when _S. aureus_ populations exceed 100 000 per gram.

Foods that are frequently incriminated in staphylococcal food poisoning include meat and meat products; poultry and egg products; salads such as egg, tuna, chicken, potato, and macaroni; bakery products such as cream-filled pastries, cream pies, and chocolate eclairs; sandwich fillings; and milk and dairy products. Foods that require considerable handling during preparation, and that are kept at slightly elevated temperatures after preparation, are frequently involved in staphylococcal food poisoning. - Mod.LL
