Several local veterinarians and pet owners are reporting cases of Bobcat Fever, which is posing a threat to domestic cats in the mid-state. The disease is carried from bobcats to domestic cats through ticks. Experts say _Cytauxzoon felis_ (commonly known as Bobcat Fever) is a parasite that gets into the bloodstream. It's so aggressive even with treatment the mortality rate is 60 percent.

"Samson was definitely one of our family members, our whole community knew him," says JH. But the Nashville cat owner noticed last [Sun 22 Apr 2018] that her 2-year-old cat was squinting and becoming more lethargic. Hammer explains, "I kept a close eye on him and he seemed to go back and forth, that was the tricky part. He seemed to be okay and then not okay. By [Tue 24 Apr 2018] night he seemed bad, he was roaming around his food bowl, unable to eat...which is a sign."

JH took Samson in to the local veterinarian on [Wed 25 Apr 2018], where she discovered he had the same disease her sister's cat had previously died from. "It begins to shut down all the their organs and it's super painful". JH says her vet, said "Samson definitely has Bobcat Fever and [he said] the most shocking part was that he had the Seresto collar on." The collar is made to prevent ticks and diseases they transmit.

JH says, "I was very shocked because when my sisters pet died the vet told her basically the only line of defense is the Seresto collar. For the last 2 years, we've had them on all our pets and that was the shocking part because it got through."

"Even if you're doing 100 percent everything you can, a lot of times we lose these kitties. Different tick and flea medications work differently so there are a lot of questions that go into it," says Dr. April Williams. The Nashville Pet Emergency Clinic veterinarian says keeping your cats indoors can help. It's also important to consult your vet right away if you notice any serious symptoms because early detection and prevention are key.

According to Dr. Williams, "For a pet to go from completely healthy to dead in a very short amount of time is pretty much the status quo of the disease and that's one of the things that makes it so awful."

JH says Samson's experienced a high fever that dropped in ICU. Despite the I.V. antibiotics and feeding tube, Samson died on [Fri 27 Apr 2018]. He leaves his sister, Chloe behind. "He will be missed by a lot of people. For it to be the 2nd cat in 2 years in our family, people need to know about this and hopefully save more lives," adds Hammer. JH says she reached out to university research institutions and is discussing ways to raise money for more Bobcat fever treatment research funding. Anyone that wants to join her efforts or learn more can email JH.
