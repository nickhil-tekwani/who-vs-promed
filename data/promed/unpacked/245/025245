Today, 25 Aug 2016, Alaska's Division of Public Health released a report that reveals that hepatitis C (HCV) infections have been increasing statewide for the last 5 years with some regions increasing in their rate of young adult infection by as much as 270 percent.

The Section of Epidemiology tracks the number of HCV infections from 2011-2015 for this report, concluding that the number of HCV cases rose "considerably" across all age groups. However, the most significant rise in HCV infections are in young adults aged 18-29, with a 200 percent overall increase statewide.

Certain regions of the state revealed much higher rates of infection in this age group than others. For example, the Southeast has seen a 490 percent increase in young adult HCV infections in the last 5 years. Though the Gulf Coast region has the highest overall rate of HCV infection, it has the slowest growth in young adult HCV infection at only 45 percent.

According to the Department, the increase in HCV infections is attributable, in part, to injection drug use (IDU) with some crossover to the current statewide heroin epidemic. "The recent increase in HCV among young adults follows national HCV trends, and we presume that our HCV-infected young adults share similar IDU risk factors. As such, efforts to decrease IDU, such as syringe exchange programs (SEPs), are needed," states the report.

[In the absence of a vaccine, infection avoidance techniques such as needle exchange programs and the need for aggressive programs in counseling, not criminalizing, substance addiction are needed. There is no evidence that government sponsored needle exchange programs increase the amount of substance abuse. - Mod.LL
