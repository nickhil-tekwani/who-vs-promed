IRKUTSK: [An epidemic of brown rust epidemic destroyed] wheat
crop[s] in the Baikal area, Tass learned on 21 Jul 2001 [according to
Galina Fyodorova], head of the forecast laboratory of the regional plant
protection station.
Fyodorova [said that] a southeastern cyclone brought spores of brown
rust to the fields last week, and all wheat in the Irkutsk Region and the
Ust-Orda Buryatia Autonomous Area is infected with the dangerous
disease, which quickly [destroys] leaves and wheat [heads].
[Unfortunately] Baikal farmers do not have ... stocks of a preparation
capable of destroying the [pathogen]. Farmers [had hoped] to [harvest]
at least 400 000 tons of wheat this autumn, as was the case last year. ...
[They believe that the wheat crop will be lost if the preparation is not
purchased] quickly.

[Wheat brown rust or leaf rust (_Puccinia triticina_, formerly _P.
recondita_) affects wheat, triticale, and other related grasses. The
disease is found wherever temperate cereals are grown. According to
staff at the Cereal Disease Laboratory at USDA, ARS in St. Paul, MN,
yield losses in wheat are generally between 1 and 20 percent, but
individual fields can be completely destroyed. Severe early infections
can cause significant yield losses, mainly by reducing the number of
kernels per spike, test weights, and kernel quality. The disease can
develop rapidly when free moisture is available and temperatures are
near 20C. Successive generations of urediospores can be produced
every 10-14 days if conditions are favorable.
Presumably the "preparation" that farmers are awaiting is a particular
fungicide which can be applied to prevent further development of the
disease. High temperatures limit leaf rust development. The disease is
best managed by the use of resistant wheat cultivars. Planting resistant
cultivars, controlling volunteer wheat, seeding at the proper time, and
the use of fungicidal sprays, if necessary, are recommended for
effective disease management. For a list of wheat leaf rust resistance
genes, see the following web site:

Perhaps our Russian subscribers can provide additional information
about this outbreak. - Mod.DH]
