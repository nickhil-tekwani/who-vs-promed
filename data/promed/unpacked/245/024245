A cow on a Madison County ranch has tested positive for brucellosis according to a release from the Montana Department of Livestock on [Mon 30 Dec 2019]. The ranch, which is inside Montana's brucellosis Designated Surveillance Area (DSA), is quarantined as they undergo an epidemiological investigation. No other animals were found infected on the ranch.

According to Montana Department of Livestock, previous brucellosis cases show animals picked up the disease from infected elk.

Montana Department of Livestock Veterinarian Dr. Marty Zaluski says there are benefits in spotting animals infected with brucellosis in the beginning stages.

Since the DSA was established in 2010, the state is able to maintain its brucellosis Class Free Status, according to Montana Department of Livestock.

"It can be concerning when a brucellosis affected herd is discovered, but our DSA producers and veterinarians should be commended for their efforts and compliance with regulations," Zaluski said in the press release. "A high rate of testing, much of it voluntary, is the primary reason we continue to find affected herds rapidly, which not only minimizes the impact on that producer but protects our state and our trading partners."

[This article is referring to the bacterium _Brucella abortus_. The infectious disease can affect humans, wildlife and domestic animals, including dogs. Historically, cattle have been the primary carriers but as states move more into close interaction with wildlife, such as the Greater Yellowstone area, or with managing cervids and buffalo, the carrier in a particular area may not necessarily be cattle. This article states that it may be the elk. Other wildlife carriers include bison, reindeer, caribou and feral swine.

Large animals, especially elk and bison may have no obvious signs of the disease. The brucella bacterium collects in the lymphatic system, the udder and the reproductive tract. Abortion is a sign of the disease. Other signs in animals may include retained placenta, swollen testicles, reduced pregnancy rates, decreased milk production and swollen, painful joints.

In humans this disease is known by several names, including Malta fever, Mediterranean fever and undulant fever. Humans may acquire the disease through assisting an infected animal in the birthing process, examining an aborted fetus without protection, drinking unpasteurized milk or other dairy products, through an open wound, or even intact skin, or a slash of infected body fluids into the eyes, nose or mouth. Slaughter workers, and veterinarians are at risk because of the nature of their jobs. Consumption of infected raw meat by humans may also be a source of infection, however if the meat is properly cooked it does not present a disease risk.

When a person is infected clinical signs and symptoms may include, fever, body aches, anorexia, lethargy, weakness, fatigue as well as swollen lymph nodes and possibly enlargement of the spleen and liver. Symptoms may develop over several weeks or months, or even immediately. Joints, bones, and especially the spine may be painful. Other joints such as ankles, hips, knees and shoulders may be swollen, warm, and painful.

The DSA is so named because this particular area is no stranger to this disease and this area is subject to additional surveillance. However, they are catching cases earlier in cattle and able to deal with fewer animals having the disease and spreading. It's nice to see the producers and the veterinarians of the state office working closing to contain this disease. This close watch for the disease in the DSA is likely why it was caught early. - Mod.TG
