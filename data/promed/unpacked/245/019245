Foot-and-mouth disease reported in NE China
----------------------------------
Foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] infections have been confirmed in livestock in northeast China's Liaoning Province, the Ministry of Agriculture announced Saturday [24 Nov 2012].

A total of 43 pigs at a farm in Erdao Village in Dalian City of Liaoning, showed symptoms associated with FMD on 19 Nov 2012, the ministry said.

According to the statement, the National FMD Reference Laboratory, after testing samples collected at the farm, confirmed on Sat 24 Nov 2012, that the pigs were infected with FMD virus serotype O.

Local authorities have sealed off and disinfected the affected area to prevent the disease from spreading, the statement said.

[A map of Liaoning is available at http://tinyurl.com/cfhb8ak; Dalian city is situated on its southernmost part. Liaoning borders North Korea on its east.

Liaoning has not been mentioned among the provinces in which FMD outbreaks occurred, according to China's annual reports to the OIE, between 2005 and (including) 2011.

ProMED-mail posting 20100318.0866 cited information derived from a local Chinese corn market report which mentioned Liaoning among 4 provinces which suffered "severe outbreaks of FMD" during 2010. No official confirmation became available. North Korea suffered a major FMD (serotype O) epizootic, affecting cattle and pigs, which started at the end of 2010 and was declared as resolved on 06 Apr 2011. The 138 outbreaks were recorded from most parts of the country, including its border with China's Liaoning.

Genotyping results of the current FMD virus strain are anticipated. - Mod.AS]
