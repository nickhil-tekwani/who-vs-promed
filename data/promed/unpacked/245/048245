Two die of anthrax in Orissa, over 20 fall ill
----------------------------------------------
Officials said yesterday [2 Jun 2008], 2 people and dozens of cattle
have died of anthrax, while over 20 people have fallen ill in
Orissa's tribal dominated Koraput district.

The disease that usually affects cattle and spreads to humans if they
eat contaminated meat has gripped the villages of Kandhasahi and
Mantriput, about 700 km (435 mi) from the state capital
[Bhubaneswar], chief district medical officer BC Roy told IANS.

On 1 May 2008, 6 animals, including cows and goats, died of anthrax
in Kandhasahi and 16 villagers contracted the disease after eating
their meat. One of them, a 41-year-old man, died 15 May despite being
given treatment, Roy said.

On 26 May 2008, over a dozen cattle died of the disease in Mantriput.
Five people contracted the disease and one of them died on Saturday
[31 May 2008]. "We have sent a mobile health team to the region. The
doctors are treating all the affected people," Roy said.

Of Orissa's 30 districts, 18 have been identified as endemic to the
deadly anthrax that kills dozens of people in the state every year.

[The last sentence unfortunately says it all. In 2007 there were 111
anthrax outbreaks in India and Orissa was in the top 5 states for this
disease: Andhra Pradesh (54), Karnataka (16), West Bengal (16), Tamil
Nadu (12), Orissa (10 -- 9 percent of the total). (There were 3
outbreaks in other states, making the total 111.- CopyEd.MJ/Mod.JW).
Year after year these states are the leaders for this disease. With
this incidence prevention would be much cheaper and more beneficial
than retroactive responses. It is an unnecessary tragedy. - Mod.MHJ
