Medical officers in Tarkwa Nsuem in the Western Region say they have recorded 63 cholera cases over the past 2 weeks -- 22 females, 41 males. The situation has been attributed to poor hygiene. No deaths have been recorded yet. Medical Superintendent of the Tarkwa Government Hospital Dr Ebenezer Acquah tells Joy News unless attitudes change, the situation will persist.

Dr Acquah also questioned the quality of the sachet water produced in the area, as well as the kind of food being sold there. He has therefore advised people to be careful when they go out to buy food or water.

Meanwhile, Okatakyei Amankwah Afrifah of Dynamite FM in Tarkwa told Joy News the sanitary situation in Tarkwa has "actually gotten out of hand." He explained that the number of people there have outgrown the sanitary facilities provided by the city authorities.

"The best thing is to start relocating the refuse dumps," which he said are now close to residential areas.

Within 7 days, 6 people have reportedly died as a result of the cholera outbreak in Ejura in the Ashanti Region. According to a local journalist in the area, Musah Inuwa, the Ejura Government Hospital has recorded more than 26 cholera cases during the week.

An 18-year-old 2nd year student of Ejura TI Ahmadiya Junior High School was among the dead. The rest of the deceased are females.

Musah Inuwa reports that the situation is getting out [of hand] as many of the district assemblies are facing challenges with sanitation.

He indicated that the senior medical doctor at the hospital is blaming the situation on the collapse of the operations of Zoomlion [waste management company] in the area.

The Monitoring and Evaluation Officer of the District Health Management Team (DHMT) in Moyamba district has disclosed that about 20 people have died from the cholera outbreak in the district since 25 Jul 2012. Speaking at a sensitization meeting organized by the Social Mobilization Coordinator of the DHMT, Kemah stated that a total of 392 cases were reported in the district including 111 children under 5 [years old].

He disclosed that Bagruwa and Fakunya chiefdoms accounted for 12 and 18 cases respectively with no deaths reported and Kongbora Chiefdom had 17 cases with 2 deaths.

District Social Mobilization Coordinator, Agnes Ngeleh, stated that they have intensified sensitization in all the chiefdoms in the district and that has helped reduce the number of cases reported. She called on all stakeholders present to put the messages they have learned into practice so that others will copy from them.

"I advise you to spread the message of thorough hand washing, environmental hygiene, and the dangers of open defecation to the public," she urged.

[4] Cholera - Zambia (Central Province)

http://www.daily-mail.co.zm/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=269:another-cholera-case-recorded-in-kabwe&Itemid=200


A new case of cholera has been recorded in Lukanga Swamps in Kapiri Mposhi, bringing the total number of cases since September 2012 to 55 in Kapiri Mposhi and Kabwe. Central Province medical officer Dickson Suya said in Kabwe yesterday, 5 Nov 2012, that the latest patient is admitted to Waya Health Centre.

"We have 1 person under treatment in Kapiri Mposhi, and this case brings the cumulative total to 55 for both Kapiri Mposhi and Kabwe," Dr Suya said.
Dr Suya said the Lukanga Swamps are still a problematic area in containing the waterborne disease.

He said medical authorities in Kapiri Mposhi have continued conducting education campaigns in Lukanga Swamps to reach fishermen and fishmongers. He appealed to Central Province residents to observe hygiene, avoid unnecessary handshakes and crowded places to help curb the disease. Meanwhile, medical officials in Kapiri Mposhi and Kabwe have called for closure of all fishing camps in Lukanga Swamps if cholera is to be contained in the 2 districts. Kapiri Mposhi medical officer Charles Mwenuna and his Kabwe counterpart Abel Kabalo say the swamps are the source of cholera in the 2 districts.

"Closing the fishing camps in Lukanga Swamps is the best intervention to contain cholera," Dr Mwenuna said. "It will definitely help a lot."

Dr Kabalo said in a separate interview in Kabwe that with cholera breaking out in the fishing camps before the onset of the rainy season, it could be worse when the rains start so it is best to suspend fishing.

[7] Cholera - China (Hubei Province)

Local health officials in China's Hubei Province recently declared an end to a cholera outbreak.

The officials said that emergency response services have been ended and all of the cases have been cured. 9 people confirmed to have contracted the waterborne illness were discharged from area hospitals, according to NZWeek.com.

In addition to the 9 confirmed patients, the provincial health department said another 9 who initially tested positive for the illness have completed an observation period and returned negative test results. They have also been discharged. The department said that no deaths were reported as a result of the outbreak and no recent infections have been uncovered.

The outbreak is believed to have originated in a hotel in the city of Huangshi at the beginning of October 2012. All of those who were infected attended the same wedding banquet. An investigation concluded that a hotel employee serving cold dishes initially spread the infection, NZWeek.com reports.

[8] Cholera - Iraq (Sulaimaniya, Kirkuk provinces)
Date: Sun 14 Oct 2012

http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=528799


Iraqi authorities said a cholera outbreak that killed 4 people had been controlled, blaming contaminated water in a country still struggling with dilapidated infrastructure. The victims were mostly in Iraq's northern Kurdistan region, where another 272 people were confirmed with the illness, Kurdistan's Health Minister Rekawt Hama Rasheed said on Sun 14 Oct 2012.

"We can say the epidemic is under control and the situation has returned to normal," Rasheed said in a statement.

Cholera is not uncommon in Iraq. In 2007 at least 24 people died and more than 4000 cases were diagnosed with the illness. The country's water and sewerage systems are outdated and its infrastructure development has been hindered by years of war and neglect.

The minister said the source of the cholera was polluted water mainly from a dam and a well in Sulaimaniya province.

Iraq's central government health minister, Majeed Hamad Amin, said cholera cases appeared every 3-4 years mostly because of polluted water from unsafe sources.

Another 15 people were diagnosed with the disease in Kirkuk.

[9] Cholera - Myanmar (Rakhine State)

Due to fire caused by conflicts in Rakhine State, people fled from their homes in Mrauk Oo town and stayed in Rakhine refugee camps. Many children under 10 years old in the camps have had cholera in the last few days, according to the information from the monks and social associations taking care of the people in the camps.

The health care workers in the camps stated that severe diarrhea among children might be caused by climate changes, limited health care for refugees, poor sanitation of food and drink, and limited sanitary toilets in the camps.

Although 4 nurses from the public hospital in Mrauk Oo township are providing medical services to the refugee camps, it is still not enough as there are many patients in the camps, according to the chief monk in Aung Myay Bawti monastery in Mrauk Oo town.
