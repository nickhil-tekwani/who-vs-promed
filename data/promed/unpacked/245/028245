The Irkutsk regional prosecutor's office initiated an inspection to
monitor how the law is followed during the utilization or
extermination of biological materials. All the animal burial grounds
have been identified, including for anthrax-infected animals.
According to the information given to IA Regnum on 15 Nov 2007 by
Alexander Semenov, senior assistant to the prosecutor, 51 animal
burial grounds and 15 biothermal [burning] pits have been found,
which were dedicated for dead animals. Anthrax spores were detected
in 21 sites, most of which were operating with serious violations of
the established rules.

According to sanitary veterinary regulations all biological waste
should be either burned or buried at specific sites, and in
exceptional cases buried in specifically designated areas. In
reality, in almost every rural settlement and farm [there are no
special places for the burial of biowaste resulting in the
indiscriminate burial of dead animals.] And where special sites are
available, sanitary and veterinary requirements are not met. The
municipalities do not care much about the maintenance of these places
and there are no funds allocated for it in budgets.

The prosecutor's inspection revealed that one of the causes of the
current situation is weakened state control of the use of biological
materials. The necessary legislative acts have not been developed to
define the [separate] responsibilities of the federal veterinary
services and regional services. Currently 2 bodies carry out
veterinary regulation tasks, the Irkutsk veterinary service and the
Regional Federal Veterinary and Phytosanitary Control Service. As
Alexander Semenov mentioned, most of the time these agencies are busy
with clarifying their mutual relations and as a result none of them
is aware about the real situation, regular inspections are not
carried out, and previous orders are not implemented.

The regional government and veterinary service have issued a report
on the necessary measures to eliminate violations. In general, 120
reports have been issued for measures to be taken to follow
veterinary regulations, 39 warnings have been issued for
non-acceptable violations, and 9 lawsuits for administrative
violations have been launched; 2 officials have been charged and 74
court decisions have been issued on accepting the actions of local
government to follow veterinary regulations as inadequate.

[There are 2 key components in the control of livestock anthrax: (1)
site control and disinfection, and proper disposal of the affected
carcasses, preferably by burning; (2) regular vaccination. Together,
these will cost effectively stop the disease and in time achieve
eradication.

In the old Soviet days these sites were regularly checked for viable
spores and most were soon spore free; some persisted but these were
usually apathogenic as the plasmids were lost over time, usually
within 5-8 years. Positive sites would be fenced off or concreted
over. It has been clear for some time that there has been a collapse
of the rural veterinary services in Russia and especially in Central
Russia. Adequate funding does not percolate down to these
individuals. Meanwhile the bureaucrats fire memoranda at each other
and maneuver committees. 'Twas ever so and is a problem not unique to
Russia. Let us hope that Alexander Semenov will be successful in
getting our veterinary colleagues in Irkutsk to be actively
monitoring the proper disposal of livestock carcasses, and that
appropriate funding will be set-aside for this. There seems to be a
move by the Russian oblast [province] authorities to investigate
these sites; see below for other oblasts to the west of Irkutsk. -
