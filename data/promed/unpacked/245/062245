SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China has issued a nationwide alert after seizing 308
tonnes of mouldy rice that had been made to look normal but was tainted
with a carcinogen, state media said on Friday. They said the Ministry of
Health issued a circular on Thursday ordering its branches to conduct
checks for rice containing such carcinogens.
The tainted rice was seized in the southern province of Guangdong. It had
been made to look normal by bleaching, polishing, and the addition of
mineral oil, but was tainted by aflatoxin B1, a carcinogen, they said. The
ministry asked health authorities to conduct strict examinations of rice on
the market.

BEIJING, 2 Aug 2001 (Xinhua via COMTEX) -- China's Ministry of Health has
issued an urgent notification to urge health administrations at various
levels to investigate and ban poisonous rice nationwide. It was recently
disclosed that some factories in south China's Guangdong Province were
producing fake name-brand rice by bleaching, polishing, and adding mineral
oil to moldy rice, which contains excessive aflatoxin B1, which could pose
serious threat to consumers' health, according to the notification.
