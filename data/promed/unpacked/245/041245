Epidemiological Week Nos. 31 & 32 (27 Jul-9 Aug 2003)
---------------------------------------------
Yellow Fever [YF]
Zulia state
---------
During week 31, a 2nd outbreak of YF began, with 5 cases (2 deaths), some of
them Colombian nationals. All were farm laborers, more than 15 years old, in
the municipalities of Jesus Maria Semprun, Colon & Machiques de Perija. There
has been mass vaccination in these areas, but this has not reached the large
number of laborers from Colombia who cross the frontier daily.
During week 32, 8 new cases were confirmed, with 5 deaths. All the cases are
males older than 15 years of age, detected in the hospitals of the
municipalities of Jesus Maria Semprun, Colon, Machiques, Perija, and
Maracaibo. An additional 11 suspected cases are being investigated and
vaccination has been intensified in areas of difficult access, reviewed in
areas already vaccinated, and continued in the municipalities north of the
outbreak area.
[Total for Zulia state: 13 cases (7 deaths).]

Tachira state
-------------
During week 31, 2 cases of YF (one fatal) were detected in male farm laborers
aged 20 & 28 years, in the municipality of Uribante. Epidemiological
surveillance & vaccination has been intensified in the area; there are no
signs of an epizootic [monkey die-off].
During week 32, 2 new cases and one death were confirmed, also in the
municipality of Uribante. Surveillance and vaccination have been intensified
in the neighboring and at-risk municipalities. Municipalities with a history
of risk are urged to intensify the surveillance of patients not previously
vaccinated, who present with ictero-hemorrhagic febrile syndromes, and reside
in or have visited any of the areas where the virus is currently circulating.
[Total for Tachira state: 4 cases (2 deaths).

Total for Venezuela: 17 cases (9 deaths).]

[In September 1999, an unvaccinated American travelling in Venezuela became
ill and returned to California. He was hospitalized with fulminant hepatitis
and renal failure, and died a week later. YF was confirmed as the cause.
The vaccination is good for 10 years. Why take the risk? - Mod.JW]
