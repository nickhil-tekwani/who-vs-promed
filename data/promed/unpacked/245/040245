Denmark finds 1st case of H5 bird flu
----------------------------------------
Denmark has found the 1st case of the highly pathogenic H5 bird flu
virus in a wild fowl, officials said on Wednesday [15 Mar 2006].
The Ministry for Family and Consumer Affairs, which is in charge of
food safety, said it would give further details at a news conference
at 1100 GMT.
"At the news conference the authorities will inform about the
measures taken as a result of the bird flu," it said in a statement.
It was still unclear if the case was the deadly H5N1 strain. So far
H5N1 has never been found in Denmark.
Danish poultry farmers produce about 3 billion crowns (USD 484 million) worth
of mostly chickens per year, with two thirds going to export. Sweden and
Germany are the 2 biggest export markets for Danish poultry

[The present list of 37 (officially OIE confirmed) countries with
H5N1-infected (domestic and/or wild) avians is the following:
Albania, Austria, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria,Cambodia, Cameroon, China
(People's Rep.of), Croatia, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece,Hong Kong
(SARPRC), Hungary, India, Indonesia, Iran, Italy, Japan
,Kazakhstan, Korea (Rep. of), Malaysia (peninsular), Mongolia,
Myanmar ,Niger, Nigeria, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia and
Montenegro, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey,
Ukraine, Vietnam.
Iraq, where H5N1 was confirmed in humans, may be added. In addition,
the following 5 countries have opfficially reported H5 in avians:
Bosnia & Herzegovina, Georgia, Laos, Pakistan & the Philippines.
Denmark's addition is far from surprising, in view of its geographic
location. According to unofficial reports, 35 birds on the Baltic islands of
Bornholm & Mon, north of Germany, were found infected. (Map at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Da-map.png>).
The discovery of infection in wild birds in other European
countries seems to be related to the intensity of surveillance
activities. - Mod. AS].

[2] Netherlands, backyard & free-range poultry: vaccination

Dutch to start voluntary bird flu vaccination
---------------------------------------------
Dutch authorities will launch a postponed voluntary vaccination
campaign against bird flu on Thursday [16 Mar 2006], the farm
ministry said on Tuesday [14 Mar 2006].
The Netherlands initially planned to launch voluntary vaccination of
its 1-to-3 million backyard poultry and about 5 million free range
poultry against the deadly H5N1 avian flu virus last week after
receiving EU permission on 22 Feb 2006.
The ministry said in a statement that owners would have to bear the
costs of the vaccination, which is an alternative to the requirement
to keep birds indoors to avoid contact with any wild [birds] infected
with H5N1.
The Dutch government fears a repeat of the devastating 2003 outbreak
of a different type of bird flu that led to the culling of 30 million
chickens, or over a third of its flock, and says vaccination could
limit the spread of the disease.
But Dutch farmers fear more countries will follow Japan's decision to
ban Dutch poultry imports when the vaccination begins as consumers
shun meat from vaccinated animals because of possible health risks.
The Netherlands is a top world poultry exporter with annual sales of
1.5 billion euros (USD 1.79 billion) and Europe's second biggest
producer after France.
The Netherlands' main poultry markets are Germany, Britain, Belgium,
France, Ukraine, Japan, Poland and Russia.

[International trade restrictions upon vaccinated animals were one of the main
factors which led to the mass culling/killing of suspected and susceptible
animals during the epizootics of FMD, serotype O, in the UK (2001) and of HPAI
H7N7 in the Netherlands (2003). If repeating such experiences is to be
avoided, the international community -- and consumers, who should be
responsibly updated/educated -- will have to modify their current,
scientifically doubtful distrust of vaccinated food animals. Obviously, this
will be possible only if the exclusive use of controlled and certified animal
vaccines is safeguarded. - Mod. AS].

Sweden Confirms H5N1 Strain in Dead Owl
----------------------------------------
Swedish authorities confirmed the owl found dead near Oxelosund had
the dangerous for people bird flu strain H5N1, Interfax agency
reports, citing the Swedish Veterinary Medicine Institute.
27 cases of bird flu in wild birds have been registered in Sweden
from 28 Feb 2006 till today, but this is the first time the strain
has been found in an owl, the agency notes.

[An early official notification to the OIE is anticipated.
Subscribers might be reminded that on 28 Feb 2006, virologists of Sweden's
National Veterinary Institute, Uppsala, which is OIE's Collaborating
Centre for the Application of PCR methods for the Diagnosis of Viral
Diseases in Veterinary Medicine, informed ProMED-mail that
diagnostic investigations of carcasses of tufted ducks (_Aythya fuligula_)
found near the south eastern port of Oskarshamn, Sweden, revealed
positive results in 2 out of 4 samples. (See [8] Sweden: tufted ducks
in post 20060301.0656).
The test was performed by avian influenza virus specific real-time RT PCR, and
subsequent positive results obtained with an H5 subtype specific conventional
RT PCR. Sequencing of the 260 bp amplicon spanning the HA cleavage site showed
a polybasic pattern (SPQGERRRKKR*GLF) indicative of highly pathogenic
properties. Comparison of the amplified fragment with published sequences
revealed 100 per cent identity (at the nucleotide level) with isolates from
Russia (Novosibirsk H5N1) and China (Jiangxi H5N1), and only one nucleotide
difference from an H5N1 isolate from Nigeria.
Samples from the infected birds were, reportedly, sent on 28 Feb 2006
to the European Community Reference Laboratory, Weybridge [UK] for further
analysis and N subtyping. Results have not been published; there is
no Swedish report on OIE's web-site.
The results of the investigations by the VLA reference laboratory at
Weybridge are anticipated with interest.- Mod. AS].

[4] Croatia, seagulls, H5N1

Croatian seagulls carrying bird flu
------------------------------------
The deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu has been detected in several
seagulls in the south of Croatia, where several swans have already
died of the disease.
"We have carried out tests on 30 or more seagulls and several samples
have come back positive for the H5N1 strain," agriculture ministry
spokesman Mladen Pavic said Tuesday [14 Mar 2006].
Pavic did not specify how many samples turned up positive, but said
they had been taken randomly between 28 Feb and 3 Mar 2006 in the
town of Pantana, near Split on the country's southern coast.
Health officials in the region, a major tourist haven, have been
closely watching the area since mid-February when 2 swans were
confirmed dead from the H5N1 infection.
Some 1200 birds within a 3-km (two-mile) radius from where the swans
were found have since been slaughtered.
And in February the ministry of agriculture stepped up safety
measures to keep the disease from spreading.
Such measures include the confinement of poultry throughout the
country, a ban on the sale of poultry from affected areas and
outlawing hunting of wild birds.

[The exact species of the infected seagull and confirmation from a
reference laboratory are requested.
The following gull species are included in the USGS listing of birds
susceptible to H5N1 (see 20051123.3403):
Laughing gull(_Larus atricilla_); Brown-headed gull(_Larus
brunnicephalus_); Great black-headed gull (_Larus ichthyaetus_) and
Black-headed gull(_Larus ridibundus_).
Recent French official update to the OIE, dated 13 Mar 2006,
summarizes this country's observations on H5N1 in wild birds (5
species, French terminology, no Latin names). Interestingly, the
virus involved - designated as A/common pochard/France/06167/2006
(H5N1), was found genetically to be very close to the Russian virus
A/Chicken/Tula/10/2005 (H5N1) and A/Bar Headed Goose/Qinghai/65/05
(H5N1). See <http://oie.int/downld/AVIAN%20INFLUENZA/France_AI_13_03_2006.pdf>.
Data on the incidence of H5N1 in various wild birds are accumulating
at an enhanced pace. See also the following recent official OIE reports:
