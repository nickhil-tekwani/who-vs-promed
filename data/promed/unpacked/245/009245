[Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) continues to be transmitted in this
region of eastern Uttar Pradesh state. Previous reports have
attributed the encephalitis cases to JEV and to undiagnosed viruses
associated with contaminated water, probably enteroviruses. The
encephalitis death toll in the viral disease in eastern Uttar Pradesh
has climbed to 488 this year (2011), according to a statement made by
health officials on 25 Oct 2011 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20111027.3197). It would be of interest to know the details of the
massive JEV vaccination drive. - Mod.TY]
