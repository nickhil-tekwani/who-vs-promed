Re: [1] Cholera, possible - Spain (Andalusia)
------------------------------------------------------
ProMED apologizes for the posting of a report of cholera in
Andalucia, Spain in "Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery update 2010 (16)
20100817.2851." The translation was correct, but the outbreak
occurred 125 years ago.

ProMED thanks Dr Barry Dyer (Manager, Medical Information and
Analysis International SOS UK Ltd.) and Claudio Po (Servizio Sanit
Pubblica Direzione Generale Sanit e Politiche Sociali Regione
Emilia-Romagna) for bringing this error to our attention. - Mod.LL
