Key points:
Ehrlichiosis was 1st detected in Australia last year in May [2020]
Experts say the disease is now "endemic" across the Northern Territory
They say preventing ticks is the best way to protect dogs

Patricia Powell's Staffordshire-cross, Leo, came close to death earlier this year -- and it isn't out of the woods yet. The 2-year-old dog became lethargic, thin and listless, deteriorating to the point that it was admitted to a pet hospital for a week for a blood transfusion. "I was really worried about him," Ms Powell, an enrolled nurse, said.

Testing confirmed Leo had ehrlichiosis, a disease transmitted through bites from brown dog ticks carrying the _Ehrlichia canis_ bacteria.

But what worried the specialists is Leo lives in the urban Top End, which some experts fear is becoming a new stronghold for a disease spreading like wildfire.

The 1st Australian case was detected in the Kimberley region of Western Australia in May last year [2020]. By June [2020], cases were rapidly emerging in Katherine in the Northern Territory and the surrounding remote communities.

The Northern Territory government has recorded 370 confirmed cases -- 110 in the Darwin region, 149 in the Katherine region, 36 in Tennant Creek and in Alice Springs and surrounds, 75. Experts say countless more have been left undetected in remote communities with little intervention.

"When we finally got to bring him home, [the vets] said he needs to stay inside, he's at risk of spontaneous bleeding and he might not make it," Ms Powell said. "It was very full-on, very emotional. "There were tears basically every night."

Until the 1st cases were discovered just last year [2020], stringent biosecurity controls had kept ehrlichiosis out of Australia. Experts are still baffled by how the disease got in but, according to Professor Peter Irwin from the School of Veterinary Medicine at Murdoch University, the disease is now considered "endemic" across the NT.

"Ehrlichiosis is one of the most serious diseases of dogs in my opinion," he said. "It makes them very ill, and many dogs can die. "Once it establishes into a tick population, it's very difficult to eradicate." Common signs include lethargy, fever and cloudy eyes, which can be cleared up with antibiotics but, if left untreated, the disease can lead to blindness, uncontrollable bleeding and death.

"The problem with this disease is dogs travel and spread infected ticks," Professor Irwin said. "Dogs having moved from an endemic area of the community into the city will possibly bring ticks with them, and the ticks can then drop off. "There have now been dogs with the disease identified in most other capitals, most as a result of travel from the north."

Doctor Stephen Cutter, the head veterinarian at Darwin's Ark Animal Hospital, is no stranger to the crippling disease. He said up to 40% of the dogs are infected in the remote communities of the Top End he visits on rotation. But in August of last year [2020], he saw his 1st case in a pet having not left urban Darwin.

Arielle Giles, a vet at the Darwin Veterinary Hospital, confirmed the disease's spread to Darwin, saying she had seen 6 cases in the past 3 months. "It's a devastatingly bad disease and it's really difficult to treat," Dr Cutter said. "It's basically everywhere and it's now a matter of living with it."

Both Professor Irwin and Dr Cutter said keeping ticks at bay is the best way to prevent ehrlichiosis. Because the infection is transmitted so quickly from the tick bites, the most important way of protecting your dog is to use a product, such as a collar that kills ticks before they bite," Professor Irwin said.

It has now been 5 months since Leo was struck down by the tiny parasite and, while he is still getting regular check-ups and his future is looking brighter, vets can't give the all-clear. "Ehrlichiosis is really nasty because it can stay hidden in the bone marrow for a long period of time," Dr Cutter said.

Earlier this year, the NT government brought on a new coordinator to transition the NT's response to the disease from a biosecurity threat to managing the outbreak. "This disease is a nationally notifiable disease, which means suspected cases of _E.canis_ need to be reported, and free testing can be carried out on blood samples from suspected dogs," said the chief vet at the Department of Industry, Tourism and Trade, Dr Sue Fitzpatrick.

[This is quite troubling. Yes, the disease is carried by ticks, but I do not understand why appropriate ectoparasite control is not available to the canine pet owners? For example, afoxolaner is a commonly available ectoparasite treatment for ticks and fleas.

"Afoxolaner is used to treat and control flea and tick infestations in dogs. Sometimes afoxolaner is used for the treatment of sarcoptic mange or demodectic mange. The tablet should always be given as directed by your veterinarian."

"According to the manufacturer the product is approved for use and available in Australia."

It has proven very effective in other countries, yet it appears veterinarians are not recommending it, or people are not taking preventative measures for their pets. If the authorities are concerned about this disease why is there not a campaign to make all pet owners aware of the problems, and how to combat it? Where is the educational outreach? There are many avenues to make this a successful campaign, whether by mailers, email, social media platforms, and news outlets. The word about tick (and flea) control is essential for animal and human health.

"Canine monocytic ehrlichiosis (CME) develops after a dog has become infected with _Ehrlichia canis_ bacteria, which are primarily transmitted to dogs through the bites of brown dog ticks (_Rhipicephalus sanguineus_). Brown dog ticks can be found throughout the United States [and Australia] (and worldwide), but are especially problematic in warmer climates, which means that ehrlichiosis is also most frequently diagnosed in these areas.

"Dogs will [usually] appear perfectly normal for 1 to 3 weeks after being bitten by a tick carrying _E. canis_ bacteria. If the dog is unable to fight off the infection during this time, the pet will enter what is known as the acute phase of infection. During this time, the bacteria are actively reproducing within a certain type of white blood cell and are spreading throughout the body. Dogs can display a variety of symptoms during the acute phase of canine monocytic ehrlichiosis, including fever, lethargy, poor appetite, lymph node enlargement, abnormal bruising and bleeding, chronic eye inflammation, neurologic abnormalities, and occasionally lameness.

"These signs will typically last for 2 to 4 weeks [occasionally longer] if left untreated. Many dogs then appear to get better on their own and enter a subclinical phase of the disease, which can last for months to years. During the subclinical phase, blood work may reveal a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia), but otherwise, dogs typically appear to be perfectly normal. Some dogs never progress out of the subclinical phase of canine monocytic ehrlichiosis, but others eventually enter the chronic phase of the disease. Signs are similar to those described above for the acute phase, but the longer they go on, the harder they become to treat. [Even dogs in subclinical phases, appear to have less energy, and frequently require longer or more frequent rest periods. - Mod.TG]

"Another type of ehrlichiosis, called canine granulocytic ehrlichiosis (CGE), is caused by infection with _E. ewingii_ bacteria, which are typically transmitted through the bites of lone star ticks (_Amblyomma americanum_). Lone star ticks are primarily found in the Eastern, Southeastern, and Midwestern parts of the United States.

"The typical signs of CGE are a little different than those that are seen with CME and include fever, lethargy, lameness is common and often appears as stiffness when walking, vomiting, diarrhea, and neurologic abnormalities.

"Whichever form of ehrlichiosis a dog has, it is important your pet be evaluated by a veterinarian as quickly as possible. Diagnosing ehrlichiosis can be somewhat complicated. Many of the signs of ehrlichiosis are indistinguishable from those seen with other diseases like Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Lyme disease, lymphosarcoma, and certain immune disorders. As part of the diagnostic process, most veterinarians will collect a complete health history, perform a thorough physical exam, and then run a complete blood count (CBC), blood chemistry panel, urinalysis, fecal examination, and specific lab work aimed at diagnosing ehrlichiosis.

"Keep in mind the tests commonly used to screen for ehrlichiosis only indicate whether a dog has been exposed to _Ehrlichia_ bacteria, and some dogs are exposed but don't go on to become sick. Therefore, to be definitively diagnosed with ehrlichiosis, a dog should test positive for exposure, have some of the common signs of the disease, and respond to appropriate treatment. Other types of _Ehrlichia_ tests are available to confirm a diagnosis of ehrlichiosis and can be used in complicated cases. [Don't wait to find out how your pet responds. Have the vet send blood to a veterinary diagnostic lab with specific tests available for a diagnosis. - Mod.TG]

"Veterinarians most commonly prescribe the antibiotic doxycycline to treat ehrlichiosis in dogs. It is typically given once a day for 3 to 4 weeks [or may be given twice daily depending on all conditions of the pet. - Mod.TG]. Other medications can also be used when the situation warrants.

"If a dog receives treatment in a timely manner, the condition will usually begin to improve rapidly, oftentimes within just a few days, and the prognosis for complete recovery is good. In more severe cases, additional treatments (such as intravenous fluids, blood transfusions, immunosuppressive medications, and/or pain relievers) may also be necessary.

"Ehrlichiosis is a very serious disease, and dogs having been infected once can develop it again. No vaccine is currently available to protect dogs against ehrlichiosis, although research is being done into developing one. As of now, the best way to prevent dogs from developing ehrlichiosis is to protect them from tick bites. Your veterinarian can recommend the best form of tick prevention based on your dog's health, lifestyle, and the prevalence of ticks and ehrlichiosis in your area."
