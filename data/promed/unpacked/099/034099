Congo virus has killed at least 11 patients in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province only owing to a drastic lack of medical facilities, Samaa reported Thursday [15 Oct 2015].

"At least 25 Congo virus-positive patients from Peshawar, Swabi, Kohat and Dir were brought to Hyatabad Medical Complex (HMC) in critical condition in last 5 months. Out of that total, 11 did not survive. Most of the patients were Afghans," our correspondent said.

According to hospital sources, a dozen patients were discharged since their condition stabilized, however 1 was still under treatment; but Samaa TV has found out that there was not even a quarantine (isolation ward) for the Congo fever patients.

"An epidemic could be in the making if things are not taken seriously. Doctors are helpless, as Congo fever demands special treatment measures, which are unfortunately not available at the government hospital," an insider told Samaa TV.

As opposed to hospital claims, some sources claim that there was no facility of diagnosis and treatment of Congo virus fever in Peshawar.

"Patients die on their way to Islamabad, the nearest city with all the necessary medical facilities," the relative of a patient told Samaa.

On the other hand, Minister of Health of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Shahram Trakzai, claimed that the government was doing what it can to save the patients suffering from Congo virus fever.

"We provide them with free medicine including platelets. Their blood samples are sent to National Institute of Health (NIH) for diagnostic tests at the expense of the government," he said, adding, "As of now there was just 1 patient in 4 rooms isolated for these disease."

The number of patients to have died from Congo-Crimean haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) increased to 3, [Kaachi] city health authorities confirmed on Tuesday [13 Oct 2015]. According to the director, 2 patients were said to have died of the CCHF this past week, while a 3rd death was reported earlier in 2015, whereas a 4th was currently battling for his life at an ICU in the CHK.

With respect to CCHF, a 57-year-old woman, resident of DHA, died at the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH) on 8 Oct [2015]; however, the city's health authorities were informed of her death on Tuesday [14 Oct 2015].

A male patient, a resident of Orangi Town, was also brought to the AKUH last week with CCHF symptoms, however, he died after the virus had advanced to a stage where his body stopped responding to the medication, Dr Aijaz informed.

A 22-year-old man from Baldia Town was also diagnosed with CCHF and was currently battling for his life at an ICU of the CHK.

[CCHF virus is endemic in Pakistan. Cases of CCHF occurred in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 2 as recently as 12 Sep 2015 and now up to 11, and in Sindh provinces this year (2015) as well as in various parts of Pakistan last year (2014). With significant recent livestock movements into urban areas in preparation of the feast celebrating the Eid, there has been a significant risk of infection for those involved in slaughtering the animals and others in contact with the bodily fluids of those animals. Health care workers attending CCHF patients also need to be aware of their risk of infection in coming into contact with blood. However, there is no indication of how these reported cases became exposed to the CCHF virus.

The virus can cause severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 percent. The virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp. ticks or through contact with infected human blood or animal blood and tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Exposure in health care facilities can also occur.

The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days.

CCHF virus is a tickborne virus in the genus _Nairovirus_, family _Bunyaviridae_.
