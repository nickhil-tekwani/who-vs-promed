A Comment on the Flamingo Deaths at Zoo Atlanta
-----------------------------------------------
Regarding the flamingos that died at the Atlanta zoo, the excellent paper
written by K. Steele, T. McNamara et al. (Vet. Path., 37:208-224, 2000)
describes in great detail the results of macroscopic, microscopic,
ultrastructural, immunohistochemical, and PCR examination of a total of 27
birds of 14 different species in which West Nile virus (WNV) was
demonstrated to be the cause of death; 5 of the birds were flamingos. In
all species examined necrotizing and hemorrhagic lesions were consistently
present in the gastrointestinal tract, brain and/or heart; viral products
were also demonstrated in those tissues in most cases.
The statement by the Atlanta zoo spokesperson that the deaths were due to
natural causes and that they could only say that the animals tested
positive for WNV would seem to indicate that a full postmortem examination
was not performed, which is very surprising given the apparent visibility
of these animals. There could certainly be extenuating circumstances that
would account for that possibility, but I wonder if there is some other
explanation.
