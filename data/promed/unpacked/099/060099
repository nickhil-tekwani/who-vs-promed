More than 6000 tareas [approx. 380 ha] of coffee grown in Paraiso are affected by rust disease causing losses to farmers.

The President of the Association of Coffee Growers, Anibal Medina Moreta, said they are desperate about the situation caused by the infection with the fungus. He complained of the lack of interest shown by the National Coffee Council (CODOCAFE).

He said that the current crop of coffee is about to be lost because of this disease unless it is rapidly controlled.

[Coffee leaf rust (CLR; also called orange rust) is caused by the fungus _Hemileia vastatrix_, one of the most feared pathogens of the crop. Of the 2 coffee species grown commercially, _Coffea arabica_ (arabica or highland coffee) and _Coffea canephora_ (robusta or lowland coffee), it affects only arabica varieties and has completely destroyed coffee industries in several countries. The disease is characterised by yellow-orange powdery lesions on the underside of leaves, where it attacks through stomata but rarely occurs on stems or fruit. CLR can lead to complete defoliation with death of the host plant.

Fungal spores are spread by wind, rain and mechanical means. Disease management relies mainly on multiple fungicide applications during the rainy season. Rust-resistant cultivars exist, but the crop is generally of poorer quality. More than 30 races of the fungus have been detected, making it particularly difficult to establish durable host resistance.
