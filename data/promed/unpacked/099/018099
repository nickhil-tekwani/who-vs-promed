BIOTERRORISM: Toughening the treaty
--------------------
Bioterrorism and biowarfare have taken on increased urgency due to the
purposeful use of the agent of anthrax, _Bacillus anthracis_, to
injure, kill, and contaminate. Unfortunately, the Bush administration,
while expressing outrage over these acts, has dragged its feet over
endorsing a protocol that would strengthen the international treaty
targeting biological weapons.
Worse yet, there is debate within the defense community about whether
recent US government research, reportedly involving simulants of a
Russian strain of anthrax, was in compliance with the provisions of
the 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention. The Bush
administration will have to make an abrupt about-face on its policy if
it intends to prevent far worse nightmares than anthrax.
Richard Butler, who had to deal with Saddam Hussein's shell games
while attempting to inspect Iraq for weapons of mass destruction,
addressed this issue at the second National Symposium on Medical and
Public Health Response to Bioterrorism in Washington last year. He
urged that international law include:
That the production, storage, or use of agents for the purpose of
bioterrorism or biowarfare be made a crime against humanity.
That state support of a group or individual that produces, stores, or
uses agents for the purposes of bioterrorism or biowarfare be made a
crime against humanity.
That provisions for verification and periodic inspections must be
present.
And that there are enforceable penalties for violation of the above.
Including these provisions in international law would make the head of
state of a country considering a biowarfare program or supporting
terrorist use of bioterrorism think twice about doing so, as it might
put him on a one-way trip to The Hague for trial. If international law
regarded these actions as crimes against humanity, even nations that
do not sign a treaty would be bound by the change. Countries that
might object include Iraq, North Korea, and others that are known to
be weaponizing biological agents or are suspected of such acts. The
United States must not join their ranks.
We must think outside the box and make policy decisions about
relatively low-probability, high-consequence events. Possession of
aerosol-generating equipment must be tightly regulated. The suggestion
that all crop dusters be banned from the United States needs to be
critically evaluated. The cost of such a ban on agriculture would be
far less than the potential savings that would result from the
decreased probability of major attacks on US population centers. Such
a policy would not play well among the farming lobby, and resources
would have to be allocated so that its impact is not borne entirely by
farmers. As the risk of death by West Nile virus and other
mosquito-borne viruses is relatively low compared with that of
bioterrorism, trucks that spray insecticides should no longer be
permitted since they could be used by terrorists.
Annual production of influenza vaccines should be increased, and large
segments of our population immunized, to minimize the number of people
coming to emergency rooms with symptoms that cannot be easily
differentiated from those due to agents of bioterrorism.
There is a lack of adequate intensive care and emergency room beds, a
policy of ''just in time'' ordering of pharmaceuticals, understaffing
of diagnostic microbiology laboratories, and even a lack of adequate
morgue space. No hospital can change its policy on these matters
unilaterally, as it would then not be able to ''compete'' in the
current health care environment. These issues need to be addressed
nationally.
In the event of a major bioterrorism incident, it is likely that many
health care workers would not report to work. A policy decision must
be made at a national level in order to supply the families of health
care and other emergency personnel with food, antibiotics, and
vaccines so that the workers can perform their jobs and not fear for
the welfare of their loved ones.
Pathogens that can be used for bioterrorism against humans, livestock,
and crops can be acquired from hundreds of collections of bacteria,
viruses, and fungi found worldwide. Several years ago in the United
States, laws were changed after an individual fraudulently obtained
the etiologic agent of plague, _Yersinia pestis_, from the American
Type Culture Collection. As a result, a permit is required in this
country in order to purchase or store certain pathogens.
Unfortunately, in many other countries no such restrictions exist. Law
enforcement authorities worldwide must identify who has acquired
anthrax, plague, and other potential agents of bioterrorism from these
culture collections and ensure that they are legitimate researchers.
The specter of an international market for these pathogens must be
prevented and, if such a market exists, it must be eradicated.
The Soviet biowarfare program was extensive, employing as many as 65
000 full-time scientists, including about 7000 considered
''critical.'' Where are they now? Many have left the former Soviet
Union, all with expertise in biowarfare, some (perhaps) with virulent
organisms. The world must regard the whereabouts of these scientists
as critically important. We need to hire and retrain them so that they
can work on mainstream projects. Congress appropriated funding for
this purpose, but it is grossly inadequate.
Without the provisions outlined by Butler, the situation will only get
worse. The history of the human race has shown that the evolution of
weapons, from clubs to nuclear arms, progresses inexorably. As
knowledge about the human genome and molecular pathogenesis widens,
tools will become available to engineer ''designer pathogens.''
Possibilities include the development of chimeras, new agents that
contain the worst features of several known pathogens; hypermutable
agents; and numerous other nightmares.
With the availability of agents of bioterrorism and the delivery
systems to deploy them, the ability to kill hundreds of thousands or
even millions of people will no longer be restricted to superpowers.
It will be routinely available to small groups of extremists or even
individuals unless the Bush administration acts now to assume a
leadership role in developing what prior to Sept. 11 was unpalatable,
a comprehensive and enforceable change in international law. To not do
so condemns us to a Malthusian future, one in which disease and war
are the Bush legacy.

that the USA move without delay to obtain ratification of the proposed
Protocol at the BWC Fifth Review Conference next month, November 2001,
in Geneva, and agreement on the terms of an international law
criminalizing the act and state support of bioterrorism. - Jack
