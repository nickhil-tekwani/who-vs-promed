In England, the national Public Health England (PHE) Meningococcal Reference Unit (MRU) confirmed 18 cases of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) between January and March [2021]. IMD cases were 89% lower during these 3 months compared to 169 cases in the equivalent period in 2020 (table 1). This low number of confirmed cases was observed across all capsular groups.

The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the implementation of social distancing measures and lockdown across the UK from [23 Mar 2020] has had a significant impact on the spread and detection of other infections, including IMD.

The age distribution of meningococcal capsular groups causing IMD is summarised in table 2, with capsular group B (MenB) accounting for 67% (12 of 18) of all cases, followed by MenY (n=4, 22%), and 1 case each of MenW and MenC.

There were 12 MenB cases confirmed between January and March 2021, 90% lower than the equivalent period in 2020 (116 cases). MenW cases were 96% lower (1 case) than the number of cases confirmed in the same time period in 2020 (24 cases). In this quarter of 2021, 1 case was confirmed with MenC disease compared to 10 cases in the equivalent period in 2020. There were 4 confirmed cases of MenY during this quarter of 2021, a 76% reduction compared to the previous year (17 cases) (table 1). There were no reported cases for capsular groups A, X or Z/E, or of ungrouped or ungroupable capsular group, during the reporting period in 2021.

Between January and March [2021], MenB was responsible for 6 cases of IMD in children aged less than 5 years of age. MenB also accounted for 71%, (5 of 7) of cases in individuals aged between 5 and 64 years and for 1 of 5 cases in adults aged 65 years or more (table 2).

The introduction of a routine national MenB immunisation programme for infants was announced in June 2015, with immunisation of infants starting from [1 Sep 2015] [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/menb-vaccination-introduction-from-1-september-2015].

Vaccine coverage estimates for infant MenB immunisation across England was 91.8% for 2 doses at 12 months of age and 88.5% for the booster dose by 24 months old (evaluated between January and March [2021]) [https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/cover-of-vaccination-evaluated-rapidly-cover-programme-2020-to-2021-quarterly-data]. The 2-dose infant MenB schedule has been shown to be highly effective in preventing MenB disease in infants [https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(16)31921-3/fulltext].

Of the 4 MenW cases confirmed between January and March [2021], all cases were reported in adults aged 65 years or older.

There was only 1 reported case of MenW for this period, in a 20 to 24 year old [https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/407865/hpr0715_men-w.pdf]. The earlier increase in MenW cases, which had been previously reported, led to the introduction of MenACWY conjugate vaccine to the national immunisation programme in England (see Meningococcal ACWY conjugate vaccination and Meningococcal ACWY vaccination programme) [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/menacwy-vaccine-introduction].

Targeted catch-up with MenACWY vaccine began in [August 2015], at which time it also replaced the existing time-limited MenC 'freshers' vaccination programme. The MenC vaccine was also directly substituted with MenACWY vaccine in the routine adolescent school programme (school year 9 or 10) from autumn 2015.

Coverage for young people routinely offered MenACWY vaccine in the 2019 to 2020 school year and evaluated up to the end of March [2021] was: 53.8% - year 9 in 2019 to 2020; 87% - year 10 [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/meningococcal-acwy-immunisation-programme-vaccine-coverage-estimates].

The impact of the MenACWY teenage and the MenB infant vaccination programmes continues to be monitored. Early assessment of the infant MenB programme [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/health-protection-report-volume-10-2016/hpr-volume-10-issue-37-news-28-october#impact-of-menb-infant-vaccination-programme-in-england] and MenACWY vaccination in the 2015 school leaver cohort have been published [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28409739/].

All teenage cohorts remain eligible for opportunistic MenACWY vaccination until their 25th birthday and it is important that these young people continue to be encouraged to be immunised, particularly if they are entering higher education institutions.

[It is apparent from numerous studies that nonpharmacological interventions used to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2, such as travel restrictions, cancellations of gatherings, closure of businesses and schools, social distancing, wearing face masks, and hand hygiene, have serendipitously lead to reduced transmission of many common respiratory tract viral infections, such as influenza, RSV, and other viral respiratory diseases during the past winter seasons in both the southern and northern hemispheres (https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/72/5/e154/5960296, https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03519-3, https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21157-9, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33791096/, and https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-19-coronavirus-precautions-flu-respiratory-infections-cases). Now the above study shows a corresponding reduction in the incidence of invasive meningococcal disease (e.g., meningococcal meningitis) in England in the 1st 3 months of 2021 compared to the incidence in the 1st 3 months of 2020 at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Meningococcal meningitis is caused by bacterium _Neisseria meningitidis_, which is spread person-to-person by sharing respiratory and throat secretions at close and lengthy contact (for example, coughing or kissing). People at increased risk of meningococcal disease include household members and roommates of a patient with invasive meningococcal disease, and anyone with direct contact with the patient's oral secretions, such as a boyfriend or girlfriend. These close contacts should receive antibiotics to help prevent them from getting the disease. - Mod.ML
