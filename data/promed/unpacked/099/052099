Focus of ASF localized in Tarumovsky district of Dagestan
---------------------------------------------------------
The Rostov office of Rosselkhoznadzor [Federal Service for Veterinary
and Phytosanitary Surveillance] reports the detection of ASF (African
swine fever) in Dagestan. A regional administration authority has
informed that the infection affected wild boars. He said that several
dead boars had been found in the border between Tarumovsky district
and the city of Kizlyar, near lake Caracole.

The specialists consider that the virus has spread from Georgia and
Armenia. The danger is that the virus spreads through wild animals,
migratory birds, ectoparasites, and also humans who have contact with
sick animals. However, there were no cases among farm swine and the
Republic's Rosselkhoznadzor is carrying out preventive measures, such
as burning the carcasses of the dead animals.

It is not clear why this information has been published by the
veterinary authorities of the Rostov oblast (where separate outbreaks
have occurred; see 2), which does not directly border Dagestan. Was
animal movement from Dagestan suspected? - Mod.AS]

[African] swine fever [ASF] already in 3 districts of Rostov Oblast [Region]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
More than 4000 swine have been burned in the Tsimlyansky district of
Rostov Region because of an outbreak of ASF in the district, which
began on 22 Sep 2009.

Over the weekend [3-4 Oct 2009], 2 more outbreaks emerged in the
districts of Morozovsky and Konstantinovsky, where 24 dead pigs were reported.

The local police have assigned mobile teams, which will prevent the
export of animals and animal products from the area. Other preventive
measures are under way.

[The continuing spread of ASF in south Russian territories, such as
the Rostov Region, which borders, on its west Ukraine and on its
north Volgograd and Voronezh oblasts, is a cause for serious concern.
Further spread of ASF -- against which no vaccine is available --
mainly by wild boars, westwards and northwards, may eventually
challenge the dense domestic pig population of Europe. - Mod.AS
