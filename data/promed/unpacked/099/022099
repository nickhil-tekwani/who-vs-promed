Two girls, aged 4 and 6, have contracted botulism in the Brazilian state of Parana. Both cases were hospitalized but have now been discharged following treatment.

Foodborne botulism, caused by eating food that was improperly processed or held at improper temperatures, is rare but potentially fatal if not diagnosed rapidly and treated with antitoxin. _Clostridium botulinum_ is the bacterium that produces botulinum toxins.

The suspected source is a sandwich eaten at a snack bar in Francisco Alves, a municipality in the state of Parana. The children's symptoms began 24 Nov 2018 in the morning. They were treated at a hospital in Francisco Alves before being transferred to Umuarama, a city in Parana. They reacted well to the treatment and were discharged 27 Nov 2018.

Officials inspected the snack bar and suppliers of the raw materials used in the snacks and collected samples of the food, which were sent for analysis. Results from the laboratory reports are pending to determine botulism and which food was responsible for the contamination.

Authorities stopped operations at the venue where the children ate after finding issues with the sanitary license and improper storage of food. Another place, where cheese used in preparation of snacks was handled, was also banned due to hygiene problems and lack of a license and authorization for such activity.

Food botulism occurs after ingestion of items contaminated with preformed botulinum toxin. The incubation period can range from 4 hours to 8 days, with an average of 12-36 hours. The higher the toxin concentration in the food ingested, the shorter the incubation period. Symptoms vary but include headache, dizziness, drowsiness, difficulty swallowing and breathing, paralysis, and blurred vision.

Another type is infant botulism, which occurs mostly in those under 6 months of age related to ingestion of bacterial spores, and the toxin is formed in situ. Four infants in Texas recently developed botulism poisoning after being given pacifiers containing or dipped in honey.

Abstract
------
Botulism is a rare and potentially lethal illness caused by _Clostridium botulinum_ neurotoxin. We describe the findings of a laboratorial investigation of 117 suspected cases of botulism reported to the surveillance system in Brazil from January 2000 to October 2008. Data on the number and type of samples analyzed, type of toxins identified, reporting of the number of botulism cases, and transmission sources are discussed. A total of 193 clinical samples and 81 food samples were analyzed for detection and identification of the botulism neurotoxin. Among the clinical samples, 22 (11.4%) presented the toxin (9 type A, 5 type AB, and 8 with an unidentified type); in food samples, 8 (9.9%) were positive for the toxin (5 type A, 1 type AB, and 2 with an unidentified type). Of the 38 cases of suspected botulism in Brazil, 27 were confirmed by a mouse bioassay. Laboratorial botulism diagnosis is an important procedure to elucidate cases, especially food-borne botulism, to confirm clinical diagnosis and to identify toxins in food, helping sanitary control measures.
