----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
After an absence of about 200 years, chikungunya returned to the American tropics in 2013. The virus is maintained in a complex African zoonotic cycle but escapes into an urban cycle at 40- to 50-year intervals, causing global pandemics. In 1823, classical chikungunya, a viral exanthem in humans, occurred on Zanzibar, and in 1827, it arrived in the Caribbean and spread to North and South America. In Zanzibar, the disease was known as kidenga pepo, Swahili for a sudden cramp-like seizure caused by an evil spirit; in Cuba, it was known as dengue, a Spanish homonym of denga. During the eighteenth century, dengue (present-day chikungunya) was distinguished from breakbone fever (present-day dengue), another febrile exanthem. In the 20th century, experiments resulted in the recovery and naming of present-day dengue viruses. In 1952, chikungunya virus was recovered during an outbreak in Tanzania, but by then, the virus had lost its original name to present-day dengue viruses.

[This is a fascinating history of chikungunya with its previous appearance in the Americas, and the confusion due to its relationship clinically, to dengue fever. Given the widespread and continuing outbreak of chikungunya in the Americas, this report will be of interest to many ProMED-mail subscribers. - Mod.TY]

http://www.proceso.hn/salud-y-sociedad/item/97571-honduras-contabiliza-m%E1s-de-12-mil-casos-de-chikungunya.html

This report is confusing in that it states that the monthly average of cases for the 1st 2 months of 2015 is 3379 cases and the total so far for 2015 is more than 6758. Perhaps this represents the difference between confirmed and reported cases. A 6 Mar 2015 report indicates that there are at least 14 000 cases since the beginning of the outbreak and an average of 1000 cases weekly currently.

Re: French guidelines on case management of chikungunya-infected patients (acute, post-acute, and chronic stages)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A recent ProMED-mail post on chikungunya in the Americas (archive no 20150210.3156702) mentioned a recent paper on an uncontrolled therapeutic experiment. The moderator TY commented on it: "One case is anecdotal but interesting, but will be of limited value until a statistically valid clinical trial is carried out." We totally agree with him about this kind of experimentation. To date, there is no drug available to heal all chikungunya [virus]-infected patients. Many drugs (vitamin C, phytotherapy, allopathy) have been tested in few regular trials and many empirical field experiments, unsuccessfully.

However, physicians must always do their best to provide relief for their patients without adverse effects. We want to stress that it is possible to help most patients with appropriate use of some well-known drugs and physiotherapy.

To avoid such uncontrolled experiments due to the lack of knowledge, the Direction Generale de la Sante of the French Ministry of Health asked the Societe de Pathologie Infectieuse de Langue Francaise (the French Infectious Diseases Society) to produce guidelines for the case management of chikungunya [virus]-infected patients (acute stage and persisting forms). We directed a group of about 20 French experts (infectiologists, rheumatologists, GPs, reeducators, from mainland France, Reunion, Martinique, Guadeloupe, French Guiana) who worked on the topic for months. After having analysed the literature and debated their clinical experience, we produced a consensus among experts that is available online (free access) in French at http://www.infectiologie.com/site/medias/Recos/2014-Chikungunya-recommandations.pdf. We have answered the most frequently asked questions from GPs and listed the adequate practices for acute, post-acute, and chronic stages; some inefficient and/or potentially deleterious treatments are also mentioned.

We think that promoting this information about these French guidelines (English version coming soon) by ProMED could bring significant help for the patients and their physicians.

[ProMED thanks Drs Simon and Javelle for this comment. The guidelines put together by this group of medical specialists will be very helpful. A version in English is awaited, and one hopes that in addition to French it will also become available in Spanish and Portuguese, because most of the cases in the Americas have occurred in the countries where those are the main languages spoken. - Mod.TY]
