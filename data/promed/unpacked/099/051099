To simplify our reporting on the rapidly-changing EHV-1 virus outbreak at the Sunland Park Racetrack, we will update the list below regularly with the most current information. While the situation warrants, we will also e-mail blast this information as it is updated.

Latest information
------------------
* Note: Jovi and Lazy S have been removed from the list of facilities within the quarantine perimeter.

Number of horses diagnosed positive for the EHV-1 virus to date: 70
Number of horses released today [15 Feb 2016] from the isolation barn: 5
Number of exposed barns that have been returned to non-exposed status to date: 15

List of facilities within the quarantine perimeter: Sunland Park Racetrack and Frontera Training Center.

Biosecurity measures among horsemen and women are still necessary, such as taking temperatures twice a day, handwashing, washing/disinfecting anything a horse has touched or could touch, etc.

The article below is from the American Association of Equine Practioners in Q&A format, providing lots of useful information regarding the EHV virus. We have also linked to the original press release and a 1 Feb 2016 overview, though the information above may be considered a later update.

[This disease is very contagious, and strict hygiene standards are vital to stop it spreading. As my colleague Mod.TG said in a previous posting: "This disease is easily spread, and every barn should almost function as its own quarantine unit. Horses should have their temperatures taken twice each day, as sometimes the only detectable sign of illness is a slight rise in body temperature. Rest is essential for the horses." For information on this disease, subscribers are encouraged to read her moderator comment in ProMED-mail post 20160124.3960827.
