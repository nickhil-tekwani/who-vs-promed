FSA publishes industry test results on beef products
----------------------------------------------------
The Food Standards Agency is today publishing the 1st set of industry results from beef products that have been tested for the presence of horse DNA.

As of 10:00 am on 15 Feb 2013, the FSA has received the following information:
- Total results: 2501
- 2472 of these (almost 99 percent) were negative for the presence of horse DNA at or above the level of one percent.
- 29 samples, relating to 7 products, were positive for the presence of undeclared horse meat at or above a level of one percent.
- At least 950 tests are still in progress.

The 29 positive results all relate to 7 products that have already been reported and where the food business and the FSA have already taken appropriate action to remove the products from sale and notify consumers (see table 2 in PDF at http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/meat-test-130215.pdf).

The FSA has been working with trade bodies in the food industry to collate these results as quickly as possible, to get an accurate picture of the testing being carried out across the UK food chain.

This testing follows the statement by FSA Chief Executive Catherine Brown earlier in the month, where she announced that the food industry had been instructed to conduct authenticity tests on their composite beef products, such as burgers, lasagnes and meatballs, in light of the recent horse meat issue.

The samples were carried out on both raw ingredients and final products, and taken from a range of manufacturers, catering suppliers, wholesalers, producers and retailers across the UK (see table 3 in PDF at the above given URL).

Where products have been found to contain horse DNA, they have been tested for the presence of veterinary drug phenylbutazone, known as bute. All of the tests for bute have come back negative [but see in item 2 FSA's News update of 14 Feb 2013 reporting results of bute tests on horse carcasses in UK slaughterhouses. -Mod.AS].

Announcing the results, FSA Chief Executive Catherine Brown said: 'Since this incident began on 16 Jan 2013, businesses have been carrying out a large number of tests. We said that industry should share those results with us, and the public, and we asked for the 1st results to be with us today. The results so far date from when businesses began their testing 4 weeks ago. They include results which were received by companies up to around 10:00 this morning.

"It's encouraging that we have received so many results from industry so quickly, which reaffirms their commitment to working with us to address the serious issue of consumer confidence in the UK food supply.

"More important for consumers, it shows that in the vast majority of cases the results so far are showing that no horse DNA is present in the foods tested. But this is still far from the full picture and we expect industry to continue to supply us with regular updates on their testing regime.

"We've asked industry to test for horse DNA down to a level of one percent. There are 2 reasons for this. 1st, that's a pragmatic level above which we think any contamination would be due to either gross incompetence or deliberate fraud; it's not going to be accidental. 2nd, some laboratories can only test accurately down to a level of one percent.

"But that does not mean that we're not concerned with, or that we accept, levels below one percent. In terms of faith groups, there remains a significant issue about trace levels of other species below one percent. So we have a separate programme of work under way with DEFRA to look at the issues around that, too.

"Further results are expected over the coming weeks and the FSA will publish another update this time next week."

A full list of all the products that tested positive is available in table 2 in the [mentioned] PDF. This information was provided to the FSA within the past 24 hours and will be subject to further scrutiny by the Agency.

[2] bute test results

Latest bute test results on horse carcasses
-------------------------------------------
The Agency's most recent tests on the presence of phenylbutazone (bute) in horses slaughtered in the UK checked 206 horse carcasses between 30 Jan 2013 and 7 Feb 2013. Of these, 8 tested positive for the drug. Of these 8, 6 were sent to France and may have entered the food chain. They were slaughtered by LJ Potter Partners at Stillman's (Somerset) Ltd, Taunton. The remaining 2 did not leave the slaughterhouse in the UK (High Peak Meat Exports Ltd, Nantwich) and have now been disposed of in accordance with EU rules.

The FSA is gathering information on the 6 carcasses sent to France and will work with the French authorities to trace them.

The samples for bute testing were taken on the day of slaughter and the confirmed results have been received by the FSA. Since 30 Jan 2013, the FSA has been testing 100 percent of horse carcasses for bute.

From this week, a 'positive release' system for horses slaughtered in the UK has been in operation. This will mean that all horse carcasses have to test negative for bute before they can enter the food chain. The Agency has now developed a testing regime which enables results to come through in approximately 48 hours from when the test is carried out.

The results of this are consistent with extra surveillance carried out by the FSA in 2012, when a selection of horses slaughtered were tested for bute. 6 percent of those tested contained bute.

Bute is not allowed to enter the food chain; however, even if people have eaten products which contain contaminated horse meat, the risk of damage to health is very low. The Chief Medical Officer's statement on bute can be found at http://www.dh.gov.uk/health/2013/02/horsemeat/.

The FSA introduced 100 percent testing of horse carcasses [for bute] on 30 Jan 2013. Prior to this, samples were taken from a selection of horses slaughtered.

The results announced today [14 Feb 2013] are the last set to have been carried out under the previous testing system which takes a couple of weeks for results to be determined. This is why carcasses were released from slaughterhouses before test results were known.

Now that a 48-hour testing system has been developed, no carcasses which test positive for bute will be released from slaughterhouses.

Horsemeat found in British school meals, hospitals
--------------------------------------------------
Tests have found horsemeat in school meals, hospital food and restaurant dishes in Britain, officials said Friday [15 Feb 2013], as the scandal over adulterated meat spread beyond frozen supermarket products.

Results were coming in after U.K. food safety officials ordered supermarkets and suppliers to test all processed meals labeled as beef for traces of horsemeat.

Whitbread PLC, Britain's largest hotel and restaurant company, said horse DNA had been found in lasagna and burgers on its menus. The company, whose outlets include Premier Inn hotels and the Brewers Fayre and Beefeater Grill restaurant chains, said it was "shocked and disappointed at this failure of the processed meat supply chain."

Officials also said horsemeat was present in cottage pies delivered to 47 schools in Lancashire county, northern England, and in hospital meals in Northern Ireland. David Bingham, of the health service's Business Services Organization, said the hospital meals, from a supplier in the Republic of Ireland, had been withdrawn.

Several British supermarket chains, including Morrisons and Tesco, said Friday that tests on their products had so far been negative for horsemeat.

Duncan Campbell, a senior British food inspector, said the results would give a snapshot of the extent of the horsemeat contamination, which already has seen products pulled from supermarket shelves across Europe. But, he told the BBC, "I think there will be still more discoveries to be made. The more people have looked for horsemeat, the more products have been found containing it. I don't think we have got to the bottom of it yet," he said.

Officials from the European Union countries decided Friday to go ahead with a plan for more intensive checks to detect horsemeat in food labelled as beef. In addition, horsemeat will be tested for phenylbutazone, or bute, an anti-inflammatory veterinary drug that's illegal to use in animals used for food.

EU Health Commissioner Tonio Borg welcomed the approval, saying, "consumers expect the EU, national authorities and all those involved in the food chain to give them all the reassurance needed as regards what they have in their plates."

The testing will go on for a month, and may be extended for 2 months after that. It will include 2250 samples of foods labeled as containing beef, ranging from 10 to 150 per country. Tests for bute will be done on one sample for every 50 tons of meat.

The scandal, which erupted after Irish authorities found traces of horse DNA in frozen burgers last month [January 2013], has grown to take in companies and countries across Europe.

NorgesGruppen, Norway's largest grocery retailer, said Friday that horsemeat has also been confirmed in frozen lasagna sold in its stores.

The escalating crisis has raised questions about food controls in the 27-nation European Union -- and highlighted how little consumers know about the complex trading operations that get food from producers to wholesalers to processers to stores and onto dinner tables.

Europol, the European Union police agency, is coordinating a continent-wide fraud investigation amid allegations of an international criminal conspiracy to substitute horse for more expensive beef.

French Consumer Affairs Minister Benoit Hamon said Thursday that it appeared fraudulent meat sales over several months reached across 13 countries and 28 companies. He identified French meat wholesaler Spanghero as a major culprit.

But Barthelemy Aguerre, chief of the French wholesaler Spanghero, denied the allegation. He told RTL radio that his company in southern France did receive a lot of horsemeat along with beef in its shipments "and we didn't touch" it. He did not provide details or specify whether he reported the horsemeat delivery, saying only "I will prove my innocence."

In the Netherlands, the lawyer for the Dutch meat vendor Draap said the company denied misleading anyone, although the attorney acknowledged that Draap's director, Jan Fasen, had been previously convicted of mislabelling horsemeat as halal meat.

"Clients get what they order," lawyer Rogier Hoerchner said in a statement. "Draap cannot see what is on the label of end products." [According to The Wall Street Journal of 15 Feb 2013, "Also coming under scrutiny is Cyprus-based company, Draap Trading Ltd., which is the Dutch word for horse spelled backward"].

[So far, no traces of phenylbutazone (bute) could be demonstrated in processed products (which included some horsemeat), while few samples from carcasses were found to include traces of the drug. Additional results are anticipated.

According to the web-site 'eFoodAlert,' the following relevant recalls have been added as of Fri 15 Feb 2013:

"1. Food Safety Recall (France): Picard recalls Picard Chili con Carne "Cuisine Evasion" (350g carton; Item code 7280.6) due to the presence of horse meat in the product.

2. Food Safety Recall (Hong Kong): PARKnSHOP recalls Findus Beef Lasagne (360g pkg; Manufactured by Comigel (Luxembourg); Imported from Britain), because the product may be adulterated with horse meat".
