PRION DISEASE UPDATE 2010 (03)
******************************
A ProMED-mail post

[With the continuing decline of the number of cases in the human
population of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease -- abbreviated
previously as vCJD or CJD (new var.) in ProMED-mail -- it has been
decided to broaden the scope of the occasional ProMED mail updates to
include other prion-related diseases. In addition to vCJD, data on
other forms of CJD: sporadic, iatrogenic, familial, and GSS
(Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease) are included also since they
may have some relevance to the incidence and etiology of vCJD. - Mod.CP]

<http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/figures.htm>


The number of deaths due to definite or probable vCJD cases has now
increased to 168. A total of 4 definite/probable patients are still
alive so that the total number of definite or probable vCJD cases is
now 172. So far, one fatality has been recorded in 2010.

Although 2 new deaths due to vCJD were recorded in 2009 and one death
so far in 2010, the overall picture is still consistent with the view
that the vCJD outbreak in the UK is in decline, albeit now with a
pronounced tail. The 1st cases were observed in 1995, and the peak
number of deaths was 28 in the year 2000, followed by 20 in 2001, 17
in 2002, 18 in 2003, 9 in 2004, 5 in 2005, 5 in 2006, 5 in 2007, one
in 2008, 3 in 2009, and one so far in 2010.

Totals for all types of CJD cases in the UK so far in the year 2010
-----------------------------------------
During the 1st 2 months or 2010, there have been 26 referrals, 11
fatal cases of sporadic CJD, one fatal case of vCJD, and none of
familial CJD, iatrogenic CJD, or GSS.

During the 1st 2 months of 2010, there were 287 referrals, 7 cases of
sporadic CJD, and none of familial CJD, iatrogenic CJD, or vCJD.

A total of 25 cases of confirmed or probable vCJD has now been
recorded in France since records began in 1992. There was 1 case in
1996, 1 in 2000, 1 in 2001, 3 in 2002, 2 in 2004, 6 in 2005, 6 in
2006, 3 in 2007, 2 in 2009, and none so far in 2010.

The 25 confirmed cases comprise 13 females and 12 males. All 25 are
now deceased. Their median age is 37 (between 19 and 58). 7 were
resident in the Ile-de-France and 18 in the provinces. All the
identified cases have been Met-Met homozygotes. No risk factor has
been identified. One of the 25 had made frequent visits to the United Kingdom.

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) biannual update (2010/1)
--------------------------------------------------------
This 6-monthly report provides an update on reports of incidents of
potential iatrogenic (healthcare-acquired) exposure to CJD via
surgery, and on the National Anonymous Tonsil Archive. Data are
correct as of 26 Jan 2010.

For numbers of CJD case reports, readers should consult data provided
by the national CJD Surveillance Unit (NCJDSU), Edinburgh (1). The
latest yearly analysis of vCJD reports (onsets and deaths) is also
available from the NCJDSU website (2).

Reports of incidents of potential iatrogenic exposure to CJD via surgery:
2000 to 31 Dec 2009
-------------------
Since the previous update report (3), 19 surgical incidents were
reported -- between 1 Jul and 31 Dec 2009 -- bringing the total
number reported since 2000 to 407. A surgical incident occurs when a
patient undergoes surgery but is only identified as having CJD or
being at risk of CJD at a later date. This means that the ACDP
[Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens] TSE [transmissible
spongiform encephalopathy] Working Group infection control guidelines
would not have been followed. The surgery carried out on an index
patient with, or at risk of CJD, may result in contamination of the
instruments with abnormal prion protein. The table below shows the
number of CJD surgical incidents reported to the CJD Incidents Panel
from January 2000 to 31 Dec 2009 by the diagnosis of the index
patient. Information about the CJD Incidents Panel can be found on
the HPA website (4).

Closed CJD Surgical Incidents (n=407) reported to the CJD Incidents
Panel, by diagnosis of index patient: 1 Jan 2000 to 30 Jun 2009

Investigation of surgical incidents may result in advice to remove
surgical instruments from clinical use (to quarantine, destroy, or
donate for research). Such advice is generally only given for
instruments considered to be potentially contaminated with the CJD
agent that have not undergone a certain number of cycles of use and
decontamination since their use on an index patient. Hospitals are
asked to consider sending any instruments to be permanently removed
from use to the Surgical Instrument Store (held by the Health
Protection Agency, Porton Down) for research. Since 2000, there have
been 46 incidents in which instruments were permanently removed from use.

The Panel may advise contacting and informing some patients of their
possible exposure to CJD in a surgical incident. Such advice is
generally only given for patients who have definitely been exposed to
potentially contaminated instruments, which have been used on risk
tissues in certain index patients. The Panel may advise that some of
these patients should be considered 'at-risk of CJD for public health
purposes' and asked to take certain precautions (that is, not to
donate blood or other tissues and to inform their medical and dental
carers prior to any invasive procedures) in order to reduce the risk
of transmitting the CJD agent further. Since 2000, 22 incidents have
given rise to such advice. There are currently nine incidents in
which 77 patients have been categorised as 'at-risk' by the Panel,
according to the current risk assessment. Seven of these patients
died before notification. A total of 31 patients are currently
notified of their 'at-risk' status. Notifications are pending for
another 31 patients. 3 patients have not been notified due to local,
clinical decisions.

The Panel has revised its advice on endoscopy and anterior eye
patients. This has led to patients being denotified in 2006 and 2009.
This resulted in reclassification of 38 patients from the 'at-risk'
category; 32 in anterior eye surgery, 2 in invasive endoscopy.

National anonymous tonsil archive for studies of detectable abnormal
prion protein
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The National Anonymous Tonsil Archive (NATA) continues to receive
approximately 250 tonsil pairs per week [data displayed as a figure
in the original text]. The archive had received a total of 81 604
tonsil pairs up to the end of December 2009 from hospitals in England
and Scotland. A further 3000 tonsil pairs have been received from the
Medical Research Council Prion Unit at the Institute for Neurology,
National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery. Therefore the total
number of tonsil pairs in the archive was 84 604. The number of
collection forms that were completed but no tonsil tissue collected
was 2395 (1565 due to patient objection and 830 due to clinical
pathology being requested).

Out of the 100 NHS [National Health Service] Hospital Trusts that
perform over 200 tonsillectomies per year in England, 91 have been
recruited and are currently sending tonsil pairs to NATA on a regular
basis. There are 120 hospitals sites within these trusts taking part
in NATA. At present, approximately 50 000 tonsillectomies are
performed annually in England. [The numbers of tonsil pairs received
from each Strategic Health Authority are documented in the form of a
histogram in the original text.]

Just over 5000 tonsillectomies are performed in Scotland each year.
The project in Scotland, where there are 14 hospitals that each carry
out more than 200 tonsillectomies per year, is being coordinated by
Health Protection Scotland. All 14 of these hospitals have been
recruited and are collecting tonsils for NATA. The tonsil tissue is
being transported to the Health Protection Agency in Colindale for
inclusion in the archive.

Testing of homogenates of the tonsil tissue from the archive began at
the end of January 2007. 2 enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) are being used
for the initial screening of the homogenates for the presence of
abnormal prion protein. These EIAs allow the identification of any
tonsils that need to be investigated further by the more specific
tests of Western blotting (WB) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) (5).

[So far only the results of analysis of tonsil samples collected up
to the end of end of 2008 have been published (see: Jonathan P
Clewley et al: Prevalence of disease related prion protein in
anonymous tonsil specimens in Britain: cross sectional opportunistic
survey. BMJ 2009; 338: b1442
<http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/338/may21_2/b1442>. The
results and conclusions are reproduced here for the benefit of readers.

"Results
--------
Testing of 63 007 samples was completed by the end of September 2008.
Of these, 12 753 were from the birth cohort in which most vCJD cases
have arisen (1961-85) and 19 908 were from the 1986-95 cohort that
would have been also exposed to bovine spongiform encephalopathy
through infected meat or meat products. None of the samples tested
was unequivocally reactive in both enzyme immunoassays. Only 2
samples were reactive in one or other enzyme immunoassay and
equivocal in the other, and 9 samples were equivocally reactive in
both enzyme immunoassays. 276 samples were initially reactive in one
or other enzyme immunoassay; the repeat reactivity rate was 15
percent or less, depending on the enzyme immunoassay and cut-off
definition. None of the samples (including all the 276 initially
reactive in enzyme immunoassay) that were investigated by
immunohistochemistry or immunoblotting was positive for the presence
of PrPCJD."

"Conclusions
------------
The observed prevalence of PrPCJD in tonsils from the 1961-95
combined birth cohort was 0/32 661 with a 95 percent confidence
interval of 0 to 113 per million. In the 1961-85 cohort, the
prevalence of 0 with a 95 percent confidence interval of 0 to 289 per
million was lower than, but still consistent with, a previous survey
of appendix tissue that showed a prevalence of 292 per million with a
95 percent confidence interval of 60 to 853 per million. Continuing
to archive and test tonsil specimens, especially in older birth
cohorts, and other complementary large scale anonymous tissue
surveys, particularly of post-mortem tissues, will further refine the
calculated prevalence of PrPCJD." - Mod.CP]

Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) animal and human TSE in
North America update October 2009
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[Submitted by TS Singeltary Sr as a rebuttal of the conclusions of
the paper entitled CJD/vCJD surveillance in the USA published in:
PLoS ONE 5(1): e8521
(<http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0008521>)
and reproduced as part [4] of ProMED-mail Prion disease update 2010
(02) 20100205.0386]

Background
----------
An update on atypical BSE [bovine spongiform encephalopathy] and
other TSE [transmissible spongiform encephalopathies] in North
America. Please remember, the typical UK c-BSE, the atypical l-BSE
(BASE), and h-BSE have all been documented in North America, along
with the typical scrapies, and atypical Nor-98 scrapie, and to date,
2 different strains of CWD [chronic wasting disease], and also TME
[transmissible mink encephalopathy]. All these TSE in different
species have been rendered and fed to food producing animals for
humans and animals in North America (TSE in cats and dogs ?), and
that the trading of these TSEs via animals and products via the USA
and Canada has been immense over the years, decades.

Methods
-------
12 years independent research of available data

Results
-------
I propose that the current diagnostic criteria for human TSEs only
enhances and helps the spreading of human TSE from the continued
belief of the UKBSEnvCJD only theory in 2009. With all the science to
date refuting it, to continue to validate this old myth, will only
spread this TSE agent through a multitude of potential routes and
sources, that is, consumption, medical, that is, surgical, blood,
dental, endoscopy, optical, nutritional supplements, cosmetics etc.

Conclusion
----------
I am submitting a review of past CJD surveillance in the USA, and the
urgent need to make all human TSE in the USA a reportable disease, in
every state, of every age group, and to make this mandatory
immediately without further delay. The ramifications of not doing so
will only allow this agent to spread further in the medical, dental,
surgical arenas. Restricting the reporting of CJD and or any human
TSE is NOT scientific. Iatrogenic CJD knows NO age group, TSE knows
no boundaries. I propose as with Aguzzi, Asante, Collinge, Caughey,
Deslys, Dormont, Gibbs, Gajdusek, Ironside, Manuelidis, Marsh, et al,
and many more, that the world of TSE Transmissible Spongiform
Encephalopathy is far from an exact science, but there is enough
proven science to date that this myth should be put to rest once and
for all, and that we move forward with a new classification for human
and animal TSE that would properly identify the infected species, the
source species, and then the route.
