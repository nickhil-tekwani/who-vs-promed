Bird flu spreads in Thailand, fighting cocks blamed
-----------------------------------------------
The illegal movement of infected poultry, especially fighting cocks
and ducks, has helped spread the bird flu virus to 7 provinces in
Thailand, officials said on Wednesday [2 Nov 2005].

In the latest outbreak of the H5N1 virus, which has killed 13 Thais,
laboratory results confirmed the virus in chickens and pigeons in the
central province of Ang Thong, the Department of Livestock Department
said on its Web site, <http://www.dld.go.th>.

Tests from 40 other provinces where poultry were reported to have
died in suspicious circumstances were under way, but Livestock
Department chief Yukol Limlaemthong told Reuters that was not a
figure that should cause concern.

Such deaths were normal at this time of year, with the rainy season
ending and the cooler, dry season beginning, he said.

6 of the 7 infected provinces were clustered in central Thailand,
with the other, Kalasin, in the northeast, where fighting cocks might
have caught the deadly disease from those in the infected central
region, livestock officials said.

"Kalasin, which had outbreaks last year [2004] from fighting cocks,
is very far from the infected central region," Yukol said.

Despite a monitoring system involving one million volunteers who
educate farmers and villagers with backyard flocks about the virus
and alert officials in cases of suspicious deaths, illegal movements
were hard to stop, he said.

"No matter how strict the measures to control the movement will be,
these birds can be easily concealed. Just keep him in a shoulder bag
and officials will never find him," Yukol said of fighting cocks
which can sell for 100 000 baht [USD 2450].

So far, however, the new outbreaks are many fewer than at the same
time last year [2004], when 44 of Thailand's 76 provinces had
reported fresh outbreaks.

The government has imposed strict measures to try to curb the spread
of bird flu, including restricting movements of fighting cocks and
eliminating a traditional way of raising ducks by moving large flocks around.

Fighting cocks and ducks were more resilient to the virus than farmed
chickens and could pass on the disease without showing symptoms, Yukol said.

The government had set a March 2005 deadline for halting the
large-scale movement of 3700 flocks of ducks that owners moved around
to new feeding grounds, but extended it to December 2005 after owners
protested, and might extend it again, officials said.

Yukol said rural livestock officials faced tough battles to restrict
movements of fighting cocks or even to cull them, as many are owned
by influential local figures.

"Who dares to touch them? My livestock officials don't," he told
reporters after a bird flu seminar.

He estimated there were around one million fighting cocks in
Thailand, 300 000 of them involved in fights regularly, but only 40
000 had been registered and issued with a "passport," which must be
shown to officials when they are moved.

Owners often hide their prized fighters, as the government pays only
75 percent of the market rate for ordinary chickens culled, no matter
what their attributes, and nothing if they did not report suspicious
deaths. Yukol said that would not change.

"What criteria can we use to say this fighting cock is worth 100 000
baht? When it loses 2 bouts, it will have to go to the broth pot," Yukol said.

The H5N1 virus has killed 62 people and infected 122 in 4 Asian
countries since the virus resurfaced in Asia in late 2003.

The World Health Organization has said the H5N1 strain is endemic in
poultry across much of Asia, and it could only be a matter of time
before it develops the ability to pass easily from human to human,
triggering a pandemic that could kill millions.

Japan detects new bird flu outbreak
---------------------------------------
Japanese authorities have confirmed a new bird flu outbreak at a farm in Osaka.

Tests by Japan's National Veterinary Institute proved that 10 ducks
of the farm have been infected with the H4 strain of avian influenza,
which has yet to be transmitted to humans.

Experts are conducting more tests on 47 other ducks of the farm,
after initial tests showed that some of them might catch the disease.
If they test positive for the H5 or H7 virus, the remaining 780 ducks
of the farm will be culled.

Medical workers have checked the farm and 8 nearby poultry farms as well.

[This case seems to be unrelated to the outbreak of low-pathogenic
H5N2, which has been simmering in Ibaraki since April 2005, probably
caused by an illegal vaccine. In contrast to the H5 and H7 avian
influenza strains, H4 is not an OIE-notifiable animal influenza (NAI)
strain. However, if found highly pathogenic by means of the
prescribed pathogenicity tests, it will become notifiable. - Mod.AS]
