A substantial increase in the number of reported Q-fever cases
--------------------------------------------------------------
The number of reported cases of Q fever has risen sharply in recent
weeks again [For the officially available data, indicating that the
2008 epidemic seems to have peaked by now, see the commentary. - Mod.AS]

The Public Health Service for Brabant had, in their last census on 21
Jul 2008, 491 known cases. That means that 5000 Brabanders have been
actually infected, says the Ministry of Health. The disease spread
rapidly in Noord-Brabant and, to a lesser extent, in the Nijmegen
region. According to Roel Coutinho, head of the Centre for Infectious
Disease Control, the actual number of victims is not 5-fold the
number of reported cases but rather 10-fold.

The state branch of the Labour Party in Brabant has raised questions
about the matter to the Executive Council. According to council member
Nora Kasrioui, it is unclear what the directorate intends to do. "The
disease is really a serious and growing problem for the population. We
believe that the politics should go into action." Kasrioui
acknowledges that it is difficult to make policies aimed at Q fever
because much remains unclear about the disease. "Uncomfortable or
not, organizations can always use help, financial or otherwise." [For
the official government policy and background, see item 2].

According to Coutinho, the disease can never be fully eradicated.
Normally it reappears during and following the lambing season. At
present, goats are seen as the main source of infection. The RIVM
(National Institute of Health and Environment), along with veterinary
experts, is considering how the transfer from animal to man is
established. Thereafter, a decision on further measures for disease
prevention will be taken. Until last year [2007], Q fever was almost
non-existent in the Netherlands.

"Measures for Q fever" [Trans. from Dutch by Mod.AS, edited]

A letter from the Ministers of Agriculture and of Health to the Parliament
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Introduction
------------
During the recent weeks, a significant increase in the number of
Q-fever infections in humans has been observed again in the
north-eastern region of the province Noord (north) Brabant. This has
led to unrest among local people. With this letter we will bring you
up to date with additional precautionary measures that we will
undertake to prevent the spread of Q-fever as much as possible.

Q-fever
-------
Q fever is a disease caused by the bacterium _Coxiella burnetii_. It
is a zoonotic disease, which means that spread from animals to humans
can take place. Q fever is traditionally present around the world and
may affect many species -- not only farm animals but also species
such as birds, dogs, cats, rats and wild animals. Ticks can be a
vector in the transmission of Q fever
between animals.

In particular, small ruminants are regarded as a major source of
infection for humans. After excretion, the bacterium can survive a
long time in the air and sometimes spread over long distances. People
can be infected through various routes, including the inhalation of
infectious, airborne particles. Human infection is often manifested by
mild symptoms but a more serious course may occur.

The main clinical sign of Q fever in ruminants is abortion in
pregnant animals, caused by the bacterium. During and after the
abortion the animals excrete large quantities of the bacteria in
their manure.

Small ruminants intended for milk production are held mainly in
so-called pen barns. A pen barn is a shed where the manure is covered
on a regular basis with a new layer of straw. When the mixture of
manure and straw reaches a certain height, the shed is emptied.
Especially during the manure removal process, bacteria are shed into
the air with the consequent risk for both the public and animal
health. Possibly, the spreading of manure on land is also a risk
factor, but this procedure seems to be of less significance than the
removal process of manure from the pen barns. This difference became
apparent since manure from Noord Brabant farms has been used as
fertilizer in other provinces without harmful results in humans.

Initiatives undertaken
----------------------
Following the 2007 Q-fever outbreak in Herpen, Noord-Brabant, some
steps were agreed between the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport
(VWS) and the Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality (LNV)
to obtain better insight regarding the Q-fever problem and to
prevent, as far as possible, its spread to man. In this framework,
advisory information on the hygiene measures to be applied in
small-ruminant farms has been prepared and published on the sites of
the Health, Welfare and Sports Ministry, the Agriculture Ministry,
and the Animal Health Service (GD).

Research by the Health Services has been undertaken in both large and
small ruminant sectors to obtain better understanding of the extent
of the problem. This research is funded by both sectors and by the
government. There is also research under way into the risk factors for
the spread of Q-fever.

The relevant research institutes, namely the National Institute of
Health and Environment (RIVM), the Central Veterinary Research
Institute (CVI) and the Health Service (GD) are also in the process
of development and validation of testing methods suitable for the
detection and identification of the bacterium.

Finally, a research initiative is ongoing regarding intervention
strategies. Special attention is paid to a vaccine which is currently
being tested in Denmark and France, considering its possible
experimental application in the Netherlands as well.

Designating Q fever as an infectious, reportable animal disease
---------------------------------------------------------------
In order to be able to apply preventive and control measures on animal
holdings, Q fever should be designated a reportable infectious animal
disease. Indeed, this has been carried out by the Minister of
Agriculture, adding Q fever to the list of animal diseases (including
zoonoses) for which compulsory prevention, control and monitoring are
regulated. Holders of small ruminants kept in pen barns are required
to report signs which may indicate Q fever. This requirement obliges
the veterinarians as well.

Measures regarding manure
-------------------------
Experts agree that manure probably plays an important role in the
dissemination of the Q-fever agent in the province of Noord Brabant.

As a meaningful, provisional measure based on the precautionary
principle, we plan to ban, for the duration of 3 months, the use of
manure from small ruminant holdings in pen barns where serious
infection has been established. A period of 3 months is regarded
sufficient for a significant reduction of the infection load in the
manure. Since the removal of manure from the pen barns is unavoidable
as soon as the installation runs full, a practical solution is to be
sought and finalized soon.

Other measures and consultations
--------------------------------
In addition to the specific measures for the treatment of manure on
infected holdings, further sector-related advice will be given in
order to prevent future spread of Q fever. One of the ideas is to
prescribe an advanced timetable for an earlier-in-season spreading of
manure in the fields, preceding the lambing season. The aim is to
prevent the utilization of the manure until at least 3 months after
the lambing season, allowing significant reduction of its infection load.

Holdings with small ruminants are often frequented by recreation
visitors and others interested. Contacts of people with infected
premises are also undesirable. Temporarily preventing visits to such
holdings seems to us advisable.

There are also a certain number of sheep and goat farms which produce
their own cheese. This is often made with raw milk. The consumption of
raw products from infected farms is discouraged by the RIVM (National
Institute for Healthcare and the Environment). It seems therefore
primarily useful to prescribe pasteurization in certain cases. The
Minister for Health, Welfare and Sport will take these measures in
consultation with RIVM.

With the above mentioned steps we try to limit, as far as possible,
the spread of Q fever. The measures are aimed at the earliest
possible action to diminish the risk of further spread. The
development of the policy is being continued.

G. Verburg, Minister of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality, and
Dr. A. Klink, Minister of Health, Leisure and Sport]

[The above ministerial letter, addressed to the Dutch parliament,
provides interesting and useful information on the epidemiology of the
disease in the Netherlands and the preventive and control measures
undertaken. It is also useful for those engaged in any handling of
emergency situations related to zoonotic diseases. Hopefully, action
plans and contemplated research will be accomplished according to plan.

In our previous posting (see ProMED archive below), data on the
disease incidence from different media sources were inconsistent; we
are grateful to Naomi Bryant, National Travel Health Network and
Centre (NaTHNaC), for drawing our attention to that. Official Q fever
data for the first 28 weeks of 2008 (1 Jan - 23 Jul 2008) are
available on the official website of the Public Health
Service for Brabant (GGD Hart voor Brabant). The total number of
reported human cases during the said period was 538. The 1st cases
appeared during week 3, remaining under 10/week until the 15th week,
when it began to rise, peaking during week 22 (72 cases). During the
weeks 27-28, the number is again below 10; the outbreak seems to be
dying out. The said data can be found (in Dutch) at
<http://www.rivm.nl/cib/infectieziekten-A-Z/infectieziekten/Q_koorts/FAQ_Q-koorts.jsp#index_35>.

According to the said website, prior to 2007 the mean annual number
of human Q fever cases, on national level, was 15. Since the disease
in animals was not reportable, there is no information on its
incidence in animals during the said years. The source indicates that
the main animal species responsible for the current outbreak are
goats, followed by sheep. - Mod.AS]
