Further to recent announcements by the Ministry of Health on the monitoring of cases of MERS-CoV, one of the doctors working in the province of Jeddah is now healthy. The ministry has, according to policies and procedures, intensified epidemiological investigations, having examined (356) samples of patients and contacts over the past week. The tests showed 3 of the health workers were positive for MERS-CoV infection, all of whom were in stable condition or have no symptoms.

The ministry has announced that it has been monitoring the status of a 70-year-old citizen in the province of Jeddah with a chronic illness, who died. Screening of household contacts revealed that one of his sons was positive for MERS-CoV infection and is asymptomatic.

The ministry has also announced the death of a health worker in Jeddah who was previously reported as a MERS-CoV infected case [This refers to the 27-year-old nurse reported in prior ProMED-mail posts MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (23): Saudi Arabia 20140404.2378035 and MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (21): Saudi Arabia 20140328.2364957. - Mod.MPP].

The ministry emphasizes that it will continue its work in a scientific manner and will follow up on monitoring for MERS-CoV infections and intensify awareness and commitment to prevent transmission in health facilities globally, according to the guidelines of the National Committee for Scientific Infectious Diseases and the World Health Organization.

[The above report addresses some of the rumors that have been circulating about possible nosocomial transmission of MERS-CoV in Jeddah, with the announcement of a physician who apparently was confirmed with MERS-CoV infection and is now recovered. It also mentions that there were 356 samples tested in patients and contacts (presumably in Jeddah) during the past week, of which 3 health workers were confirmed to have coronavirus infection.

To summarize the information on number of events being reported, it appears as though there are 6 newly reported laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV infections in Jeddah, 4 in health care workers, 2 in non-healthcare workers, a 70-year-old, and his son who was asymptomatic. In addition, there were 2 deaths reported, one in the non-healthcare worker newly reported today (6 Apr 2014, the 70 year old with co-morbidities), the other in the healthcare worker (27 years old) previously reported.

More information on these 6 newly reported MERS-CoV infections would be greatly appreciated, such as the age of the individuals, clinical status, date of onset of illness in those who were symptomatic, and possible exposure risk factors such as contact with known MERS-CoV infected individuals and contact with animals (especially camels).

If this moderator's interpretation of the number of newly reported cases mentioned in the above report is correct, this will bring the global tally of MERS-CoV infected individuals to 216 cases including 89 deaths (The most recent global tally of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by WHO is 207 cases including 87 deaths; see MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (22): UAE, WHO 20140401.2373381). This tally does not include the 3 cases reported on the MOH website on 3 Apr 2014 -- see MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (23): Saudi Arabia 20140404.2378035 -- and the 6 cases including 2 deaths reported in today's (6 Apr 2014) report.
