Swedish researchers said on Monday [22 Aug 2005] that they had identified a
previously unknown virus which may cause many cases of serious respiratory
infections in children. They named the virus Human bocavirus and suggested
the researchers start a systematic search for all the viruses that cause
respiratory infections. The report, published in this week's issue of the
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, underlines how little
doctors know about the sources of most respiratory infections.
A separate team of California researchers found they could identify only
about 40 percent of viruses infecting patients, and both teams said rapid
testing for viruses would be useful in diagnosing and treating respiratory
illnesses. Health experts say this step was particularly important because
there are fears that influenza, in particular avian influenza, could cause
a global pandemic. Being able to test quickly to find out what is making
someone sick can mean the difference between life and death, because
antiviral medications must be given early on to prevent serious illness in
the case of influenza.
In their sample of 540 children in a pediatric hospital ward, the new
bocavirus was responsible for 17 of the cases, the Swedish researchers
found. "Lower respiratory tract infection is a leading cause for
hospitalization of infants and young children and accounts for 250 000
hospitalizations a year in the United States alone," Tobias Allander of the
Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and colleagues wrote in their report.
"The most important viral agent in this group of patients is respiratory
syncytial virus (RSV). Other important agents are influenza viruses,
parainfluenza viruses, adenoviruses, rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, and human
metapneumovirus." But the causes of between 12 percent and 39 percent of
these serious infections are never identified," the researchers said.
In a 2nd study, Janice Louie of the California Department of Health
Services, Lawrence Drew of the University of California, San Francisco and
colleagues checked patients reporting to the hospital with flu-like illness
including "unspecified upper respiratory infection," acute bronchitis,
sinus infections, and pneumonia. They could identify a virus in only 103,
or 39 percent, of the patients. These included influenza A or B in 54
patients, picornavirus in 28, RSV in 12, human metapneumovirus in four and
human coronavirus OC43 in 2 patients.

A new human virus, provisionally named human bocavirus, has been identified
in the respiratory secretions of children, according to a report released
Monday. "Our approach and methodology are similar to [those] of the human
genome project," Dr. Tobias Allander from Karolinska University Hospital,
Stockholm, told Reuters Health. "Our finding of a rather prevalent
previously unknown pathogen suggests that the screening is worth pursuing
in a larger scale."
The new virus is similar to 2 related members of the Bocavirus family that
infect cattle and dogs, report Allander and colleagues. Consequently, they
propose the name "human bocavirus (HBoV)" for the new virus, writing in the
research journal PNAS Early Edition. The virus was first spotted in 2
specimens from Asian patients.
In a later series of screenings, 17 of 540 nasal samples proved to be
positive for HBoV, the researchers found, and in 14 cases it was the only
virus detected. All 14 children with HBoV for whom records were available
had respiratory illness for 1-4 days prior to hospital admission. None of
the HBoV-infected children had gastrointestinal symptoms, conjunctivitis or
rash, the authors say.
"We will of course perform additional studies on human bocavirus," Allander
said. "However, in order to sort out the epidemiology, disease association,
and other aspects of this infection, multiple studies from all around the
world will likely be more important."
To identify other viruses, Allander explained, "we are working on a number
of sample collections in collaboration with clinicians. However, we believe
that the most fruitful future approach will be a broad and unbiased
exploration of the viruses that infect humans, a 'human virome' project. We
think such a collaborative project should be seriously discussed." There
are many diseases with no known cause, "and some of them have similarities
to virus infections," he concluded. "Therefore, virus discovery is an
urgent scientific task."
