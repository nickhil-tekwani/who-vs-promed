Week 12, 2013
-------------
During the last week (17 - 23 Mar 2013), newly infected dairy farms have been discovered in Yavneel, Afek, Merom Gileboah, Ayelet Hashachar and Bet-She'arim [all in Hazafon=north district]. New cases have been recorded also within previously-infected farms (Ramot, Ramat-Tzevi, Ushah, Yonatan).

There is unofficial information on new LSD outbreaks in the Palestinian authority territory, West Bank, namely in the Jenin and Nablus sub-districts.

The morbidity rate recorded in the dairy farms Merom-Gilleboah, Gazit and Ein-Dor is about 20 percent.

The 'Hachaklait' has declared an emergency preparedness situation in order to accomplish vaccinations wherever not yet completed. The vaccine injected by Hachaklait is the OBP Lumpy Skin Disease Vaccine (Neethling strain).

[We have noted that several new outbreaks have been recorded during the 2 days since the publication of the above weekly circular. The disease seems to have accelerated its spread during the last week, in tandem with temperature elevation, threatening to infect the entire territory of Israel and of the Palestinian authority (PA). The PA cattle population is about 30 000, compared to Israel's some 450 000 cattle, including about 110 000 milking cows with average annual yields of 11 500 kg milk/cow. Obviously, a cause for grave concern.

According to Israel's last LSD follow-up report to the OIE, submitted 19 Mar 2013, 94 outbreaks have been reported since the start of the epizootic (on the northern frontiers with Syria and Lebanon) in July 2012. OIE maps of the accumulated reported foci are available for Israel (as of 19 Mar 2013) at http://tinyurl.com/cnx2bng, for the PA's West Bank (as of 11 Mar 2013) at http://tinyurl.com/caauqt2, and for Lebanon (as of 16 Feb 2013) at http://tinyurl.com/ctq7xnm (go to the reports' bottoms).

Recorded information on the efficacy of the 2 vaccines used (see 20130319.1594378), as observed in field conditions, will be of significant value in the regional context and beyond. - Mod.AS.
