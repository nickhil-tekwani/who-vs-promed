Anthrax in Chittoor a sporadic phenomenon
-----------------------------------------
Despite the claim of the district administration on eradication of anthrax,
sporadic cases of the disease were reported in Chittoor in the last 5
years. A glance at the Anthrax Outbreak Report (OBR) from 2003 of the
Animal Husbandry Department revealed that 9 cases of anthrax were reported
in 2003, 15 in 2004, 7 in 2005, 10 in 2006, and 11 in 2007. Two cases were
reported in the district so far [in 2008].
However, there had been no human deaths due to the affliction of the
disease from cattle since 1997, according to officials.
It may be noted here that after the death of 3 people due to anthrax at
Cheemalpenta in Penumur mandal in 1997, the Animal Husbandry Department
launched an intensive vaccination programme covering all the animals in the
affected villages.
Talking to "this website's newspaper", joint director of Animal Husbandry
Somasekhar said as a preventive measure in the villages where anthrax cases
were reported, vaccination of animals was taken up. Accordingly, the
department is conducting the vaccination programme in the villages once in
8 months, he said.
Meanwhile, district collector SS Rawat held a meeting with mandal level
officials of the Animal Husbandry Department here on Tuesday [22 Jan 2008]
and discussed the course of action to be followed to prevent anthrax.
Reviewing the disease status mandal-wise, Rawat urged the officials to
ensure proper distribution of antibiotics to contain the disease and
promote awareness among people about preventive measures. He directed the
medical officers of veterinary hospitals to stock anthrax vaccine to meet
any eventuality. The doctors of Primary Health Centres [PHC] were asked to
send reports to the collectorate if anyone afflicted with the disease was
admitted to PHCs.
Somasekhar said teams of veterinarians visited Jandlapeta in Karvetinagaram
mandal following reports of an outbreak of anthrax. The laboratory tests
revealed that sheep in the village died due to some urinary track infection
and not of anthrax. However, as a precautionary measure, an intensive
anti-anthrax campaign was taken up in villages in Karvetinagaram and
surrounding mandals, he said.

I just received your mail. In fact I was aware of the report of human cases
with cutaneous lesions admitted in CMC [Christian Medical College] Vellore
after getting initial therapy at the government hospital at Vellore. [This
is just inside Tamil Nadu and south of Chittoor, which is in Andra Pradesh.
- Mod.MHJ] I am not sure (probably culture negative) about the culture
report from those skin lesions. But the state (Tamil Nadu) health minister
came out in the newspaper and television saying that these cases were not
associated with anthrax and he as well said that enough measures are being
taken to vaccinate the cattle in the affected village by the animal
husbandry unit. But to my knowledge there were reports of death of sheep in
this village near Chittoor. These were handled by the local people,
following which cutaneous lesions were noticed in some contacts. If there
is any further information, I will relay it to you.

[While the affected sheep in Jandlapeta village in Karvetinagaram mandal
appear to have died of some urinary problem, the official response is
either still suspicious of anthrax or is taking advantage of the event to
get caught up on their livestock vaccination. Claims of eradication by the
district authorities in the face of ongoing sporadic cases tells me that
the control and surveillance of this disease had fallen into abeyance. If
these villagers did suffer from some form of cutaneous lesion it would
definitely raise suspicions of something possibly indicative of cutaneous
anthrax. It is difficult to confirm human cutaneous cases largely because
of prior access to oral antibiotics and the sensitivity of _Bacillus
anthracis_ to antibiotics. Thus though the signs are all there, they will
be culture negative. But they could well be staphylococcal infections. So
at this point the decision is best described as "probably negative" until
we get any further information.
Thanks to Brent and Angamuthu for these updates. - Mod.MHJ]
