Company Announcement
------
Midwestern Pet Foods, Inc., of Evansville, IN is expanding its 30 Dec 2020 voluntary recall of certain dog and cat food products produced in our Chickasha Operations Facility to include all dog and cat pet food products made with corn products because those products may contain aflatoxin levels which exceed acceptable limits. Products were distributed nationally to online distributors and retail stores nationwide. Midwestern Pet Foods is expanding its voluntary recall out of an abundance of caution to help protect the health and safety of pets. The products recalled cover all (foods) expiring on or before 9 Jul 2020 depicted as "07/09/22" in the date code on the product, as discussed below. Products with expiration dates after 07/09/22 are not included in the recall.

Aflatoxin is a toxin produced by the mold _Aspergillus flavus_, which can grow on corn and other grains used as ingredients in pet food. At high levels, aflatoxin can cause illness and death in pets.

There have been reports of illnesses and deaths in dogs associated with certain lots of products. No human illnesses have been reported. Out of an abundance of caution, we have expanded this recall to cover all corn products containing pet foods with expiration dates prior to 07/09/22.

If your pet shows signs of aflatoxin poisoning including sluggishness, loss of appetite, vomiting, jaundice (yellowish tint to the eyes, gums, or skin due to liver damage), and/or diarrhea, contact a veterinarian immediately. Provide a full diet history to your veterinarian. It may be helpful to take a picture of the pet food label, including the lot number and best buy date.

Lot code information may be found on the back of bag and will appear in a 3‐line code, with the top line in format "EXP 03/03/22/05/L#/B###/HH:MM".

As explained above, this recall covers ONLY product manufactured at Midwestern Pet Food's Chickasha, Oklahoma facility. Note that the unique Chickasha Facility identifier is located in the date code as a "05" and "REG. OK‐PFO‐0005" at the end of the date code.

In addition, the only Midwestern Pet Foods facility that produces product bearing a 3‐line date code is our Chickasha facility (See 1st image below). [Please see the image at the bottom of the FDA page: https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/midwestern-pet-foods-voluntarily-expands-recall-pet-food-aflatoxin-health-risk.

Retailers and distributors should immediately pull recalled lots from their inventory and shelves. Do not sell or donate the recalled products. Retailers are encouraged to contact consumers who have purchased the recalled products, if you have the means to do so (frequent buyer cards, etc.).

Pet parents: do not feed the recalled products to your pets or any other animals. Destroy the food in such a way that children, pets and wildlife cannot access them. Wash and sanitize pet food bowls, cups, and storage containers. Always ensure you wash and sanitize hands after handling recalled food or any utensils which have contacted recalled food. Contact Midwestern Pet Foods Consumer Affairs at 800‐474‐4163, ext. 455 from 7AM to 4PM Central Time, Monday through Friday, or by email at <info@midwesternpetfoods.com> for additional information.

This voluntary recall is being conducted in cooperation with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. All other Midwestern Pet Foods products are unaffected by this recall action.

[Signs of aflatoxicosis in dogs include:
- bloody vomiting or diarrhea
- general lethargy
- loss of appetite
- increased water consumption and urination
- jaundice or yellowing of the whites of the eyes or gums or inside of the ears, especially in cats
- in severe cases, aflatoxin can cause death.

Although aflatoxin has been associated with cancer in people, it does NOT cause cancer in dogs. Dogs do not live long enough to develop any kind of cancer associated with aflatoxin.

Dogs are sensitive to low-level long-term intake. Although the clinical signs listed above are correct, it is important to realize there are other causes of the same signs. It is important to have your pet evaluated by a veterinarian if there are signs of illness.

If you have purchased any of the food mentioned by name and expiration date, please remove and discard the food. Do not feed them this food. Please take your pet to a veterinarian for a complete check-up, including necessary blood work. - Mod.TG
