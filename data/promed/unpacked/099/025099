[Earlier during 2015, the Palestinian Authority notified to the OIE 3 HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in poultry, reportedly starting 20 Jan 2015, declared resolved 16 Feb 2015.

The disease control policy applied, which may be defined as partial or modified stamping out policy, is reflected by the following total outbreak's statistics, as reported to the OIE:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds / 26 600 / 26 600 / 16 600 / 1900 / 4000
According to the said statistics, 4100 of the infected birds remained on the premises; see at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000017232_20150220_190428.pdf.
The virus seems to continue its circulation within the said territories.

Adjacent Israel has reported 8 HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in 2015, starting 18 Jan 2015, declared resolved 11 Feb 2015. Stamping-out policy was applied. The total statistics, as reported to the OIE, were:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds / 303 000 / 52 400 / 22 630 / 126 940 / 0
Spur-winged Lapwing / - / 1 / 0 / 1 / 0
Hopefully, the applied stamping out measure will exclude additional outbreaks. However, in view of the continued circulation of the virus within the Palestinian territories, alertness and vigilance by both parties are prescribed. - Mod.AS
