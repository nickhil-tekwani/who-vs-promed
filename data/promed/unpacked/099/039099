South Korean quarantine officials found 2 dead eagle owls infected
with the virulent strain of bird flu in the central western part of
the country on Friday [10 Dec 2010].

The farm ministry, however, said that the discovery of the owls did
not mean South Korea was affected by the disease, since no
domestically raised ducks and chickens have become sick from the
highly contagious influenza. Exports of poultry will not be affected
by the discovery, it stressed.

The wild birds were found dead in Seosan, 151 km south of Seoul [map
at <http://healthmap.org/r/0iMv>]. Local quarantine officials carried
out routine tests and discovered the birds had the H5N1 strain of the
influenza virus, the ministry said.

Bird flu is an air-borne disease that is usually transmitted between
animals. The disease can spread to humans, but no human cases have
been reported in the country so far.

The country's quarantine authorities, meanwhile, have stepped up an
existing bird flu prevention campaign after a wild duck on the
Mangyeong River tested positive for the influenza virus earlier in
the week [archived 20101208.4377].

The country was hit a total of 3 times by avian influenza, with the
latest outbreak occurring in April of 2008 and resulting in a record
8.46 million birds being culled at a cost of around 264 billion won
[USD 215.7 million]. Previous outbreaks took place in the winter
months of 2003-2004 and 2006-2007.

[The above newswire reports that the 2 eagle owls were "infected with
the virulent strain of bird flu" and that "routine tests discovered
the birds had the H5N1 strain." Official laboratory confirmation,
including pathogenicity, are anticipated.

The HPAI H5N1 case detected in a wild mallard (_Anas platyrhynchos_)
collected on 29 Nov 2010 in the Cholla-Bukdo province (also known as
Jeollabuk-do, or North Jeolla), as reported in archived
20101208.4377, has been laboratory confirmed on 7 Dec 2010.
Accordingly, S. Korea notified the OIE about this finding on 9 Dec
2010 [see 20101211.4410]. The immediate notification, with map, is
available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=10029>.
It includes the following epidemiological comment:

"As part of a continuous avian influenza surveillance programme, 39
wild birds were captured, and samples (faeces, laryngo-pharyngeal
swab) were collected. The NVRQS found avian influenza antigen (H5) by
PCR and confirmed it as highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1)
virus by gene sequencing from one mallard duck on 7 Dec 2010.
Clinical surveillance and disinfection on the neighbouring poultry
farms were enhanced."

The current case, in Seosan, in the province Chungcheongnam-do (South
Chungcheong or Chungnam), is situated at a distance of at least 120
km from the mallard duck case, mentioned above. If confirmed as HPAI
H5N1, it means a wider circulation of the virus within wild birds.

In any event, such findings demonstrate the merit of the surveillance
policy applied by the S. Korean authorities. Early detection of
circulating virus enables preventive measures to be undertaken in a
timely manner in commercial farms. - Mod.AS]
