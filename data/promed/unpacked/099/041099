Egypt is to receive the 1st batch of foot and mouth disease vaccine from Botswana Vaccine Institute (BVI) that was dispatched on Monday [30 Apr 2012]. The General Manager of BVI [Botswana Vaccine Institute], Dr Onkabetse Matlho, told a media briefing in Gaborone this week that it was his company's 1st order from the leading Arab country.

BVI was handling the order of 2 million doses in partnership with its technical advisors, MERIAL SAS, Matlho said. "The 1st batch of 1.1 million doses has been blended and 420 000 doses dispatched to Egypt on Monday [30 Apr 2012]," he explained. "It will be followed by 300 000 doses to Libya and the balance of 350 000 doses to the Gaza Strip (Palestine) in May [2012]." Although the GM did not say how much it cost to produce the vaccines, the Egyptian and Libyan orders earned BVI 5 million Botswana Pula [USD 670 500].

Matlho disclosed that field investigations by FAO experts had shown that the outbreak in Egypt was caused by an entirely new virus strain. BVI was, therefore, producing a medicine specific to the conditions in Egypt that were different from Botswana's. BVI continues to stamp considerable authority on the international market of animal vaccines. "In addition to supplying the SADC region, we sold to Pakistan in 2000," Matlho said. "We have also sold to Saudi Arabia.

[The vaccine needed for the prevention and control of the current epizootic(s) in Egypt, Libya and the Gaza strip should be based upon FMDV SAT 2 topotype VII strain. The topotype VII reference vaccine strains mentioned by WRLFMD are Saudian and Eritrean isolates. The latter is the one included in the vaccine recently applied in Israel and the Gaza strip. Data on the vaccine strain included in the Egyptian vaccine, manufactured locally (in Abbassiya) and currently applied in several governorates, have not become available and will be appreciated.

Since 2011, the demands for large quantities of FMD vaccines in Botswana and neighboring countries have increased following the spread of FMD, primarily of the SAT 2 serotype. An outbreak of FMDV serotype SAT 2 in the Ngamiland District of Botswana last year [2011], probably originating in Zimbabwe, led to the loss of the European Union (EU) beef market. The EU recommended that the Botswana Meat Commission (BMC) should take severe measures in order to enable re-admittance of Botswana's beef to the EU market, which is pending.

Recent outbreaks in Botswana and Zimbabwe were caused -- according to WRLFMD data -- by SAT 2 topotypes I and III. According to the data of the WRLFMD, 2010 and 2011 FMDV SAT 2 isolates from Botswana and Zimbabwe showed no matching with the Eritrea (topotype VII) vaccine strain.

The above report says that "the 1st batch of 1.1 million doses has been blended." In view of BVI's engagement in vaccine production against other SAT 2 strains, one may ask whether the FMDV SAT 2 vaccine for the Middle East has been produced from a live virus grown within the plant or rather reconstituted and bottled in Botswana from concentrated antigen produced elsewhere.

Details on the vaccine strain included in the BVI vaccine and, foremost, on results of matching trials of this (new?) vaccine with the current SAT 2 strain(s) circulating in the Middle East will be welcomed. - Mod.AS
