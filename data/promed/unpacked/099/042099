Whole bamboo shoots imported by Canda Enterprise may contain botulism
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and Canda Enterprise Co Ltd are
warning the public not to consume canned whole bamboo shoots, because the
product may be contaminated with the bacteria responsible for botulism, a
foodborne illness in humans. The affected product, Whole Bamboo Shoots, is
sold in a 400 g vacuum type package bearing UPC 6 921926966680. The
affected product does not contain lot codes or "best before" dating.
The importer, Canda Enterprise Co Ltd, Burnaby, British Columbia, is
voluntarily recalling the affected product from the marketplace. The
affected product has been distributed in Alberta and British Columbia.
Botulism is a life-threatening illness caused by the ingestion of toxins
produced by _Clostridium botulinum_ bacteria. Food contaminated with _C.
botulinum_ may not look or smell spoiled. The product should not be
consumed by humans or animals. There have been no reported illnesses
associated with the consumption of this product.
The CFIA is monitoring the effectiveness of the recall. For more
information, consumers and industry can call the CFIA at 1-800-442-2342.
8:00 am to 4:00 pm local time -- Monday to Friday.
