[This is the 4th country to be implicated in EIA outbreaks this year
(2010), the others being Romania, Belgium and UK. In fact, the
Belgium and UK cases have been associated with an original Romanian
outbreak. It will be important to establish any potential association
of this new German outbreak with the previous cluster of cases
occurring early in the season for this mosquito borne disease. For
concerns on the speed of detection of diseases associated with this
cluster of outbreaks in separate countries, see the comments of
