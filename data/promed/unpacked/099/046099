This week, Doctors Without Borders/Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) launched Ebola virus disease management activities in the Beni health zone of the Democratic Republic of Congo, supporting the efforts of the Ministry of Health. In the Butsili and Kanzulinzuli health centers, MSF's response focuses on triage, detection, and isolation of suspected cases. Our teams, alongside those of the Ministry of Health, carry out outpatient consultations for patients of all ages admitted to the isolation unit.

MSF's team will ensure the rehabilitation and structural improvements of the 2 health centers and assist with sustaining the supply of medicines and food for the patients admitted to the isolation center and their companions. In addition, we will provide technical support to monitor community activities in order to locate and identify contact cases in the community, but also social monitoring of all high-risk contacts through the distribution of kits including telephones and food to make it easier for people suspected to have Ebola to self-isolate and limit viral transmission. People at high risk, including contacts of confirmed cases and first responders, will be vaccinated to contain the spread of the virus.

Between [8 Oct 2021], when the 1st positive case was detected, and [20 Oct 2021], 5 new cases were confirmed, including 3 deaths, in the Butsili health center. A previous epidemic was officially declared over on [3 May 2021], in Butsili, with an assessment of 5 confirmed cases including 3 deaths and 308 contacts followed in the area, according to data from health authorities.

The Beni health zone was one of the epicenters of the 2018-2020 Ebola virus disease outbreak in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. It is located about 50 kilometers (about 30 miles) from the town of Butembo, the scene of an epidemic between [7 Feb and 3 May 2021]. MSF teams have been involved in all responses, particularly in the face of the severe epidemic in North Kivu and Ituri, which was declared over in 2020.

[This current outbreak in the Beni health zone of the DRC appears to be in good hands thanks to the vaccine, healthcare workers' experience, and good contact tracing. It would be good if the health centers were maintained in good operating condition even when there is no outbreak in order to treat people for neglected tropical diseases and COVID-19, and all other medical issues. But at least MSF plans to take on rehabilitation and structural improvements at this time. - Mod.LK
