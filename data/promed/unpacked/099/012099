This time, it is at the Girls' Hostel of the Maulana Azad Medical College (MAMC) in the Capital [Delhi] where 53 medical students have reportedly contracted hepatitis A after consuming contaminated water, and possibly food. While doctors from the Community Medicine Department and the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) have gone into action to tackle the situation, students alleged the college authorities had turned a blind eye to repeated complaints about "miserable" water quality.

With hepatitis A looming large, students have been asked to report any form of illness that may indicate contracting the virus. At least 53 students from the girls' hostel of the Maulana Azad Medical College have taken ill after reportedly consuming contaminated water and food. Notices have been put up across the hostel urging the students to inform community medicine department if anyone is suffering from hepatitis A or any water-borne disease, or even if there are symptoms of any such disease.

The GB Pant Hospital, which is associated with MAMC, has hurriedly constituted a committee to deal with the problem, and water facilities at the hostel have been inspected. But it is a belated action, students said. "We complained several times to the college authorities, but everyone turned a blind eye. The drinking water facilities were already miserable, and adding to the problem were the workers in hostel mess who had been rearing rabbits. The rodents often nibbled on the food that was supplied to us," a student alleged.

"Two months ago [November 2013], some students fell ill but the authorities didn't pay any attention. Gradually, the numbers started increasing. Today [31 Jan 2014], at least 53 students are suffering from hepatitis A," she said. Pointing at apathy on part of the college authorities, another student alleged that there was no provision to check quality of food and water. "The water in the hostel was really bad. We are compelled to stay here and consume the dirty food and water," she said on condition of anonymity.

A visibly shaken up college administration is now trying to get things in order.

"In November 2013, we came across some cases of Hepatitis A. Earlier this week [week of 27 Jan 2014], we had a few more cases. We immediately started chlorination of water. We have cleaned the water coolers and water filters. We have called in NICD experts in the college," said Dr Deepak K. Tempe, Dean of MAMC.

"Some cases of food poisoning are also suspected because of the rabbits in the mess. We have already removed the rabbits from the mess," he claimed. "The department of community medicine has also been chipped in. We have constituted a committee of doctors that is looking into the matter seriously," Tempe added.

The college authorities are mulling over the need to vaccinate all the students, but NICD has not recommended mass vaccination so far.

Meanwhile, officials of Delhi Jal Board have blamed the hostel authorities. "There can be a possibility that they are not cleaning their water tanks or pipes," a Delhi Jal Board official said.

[Hepatitis A is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis A virus. The virus is spread by faecal-oral transmission. Hepatitis A is closely associated with inadequate sanitation and poor personal hygiene. Unlike hepatitis B and C, hepatitis A infection does not cause chronic liver disease and is rarely fatal, but it can cause debilitating symptoms. Hepatitis A occurs sporadically and in epidemics worldwide, with a tendency for cyclic recurrences. Waterborne outbreaks, though infrequent, are usually associated with sewage contaminated or inadequately treated water.

Casual contact among people does not spread the virus. In developing countries [where sanitary conditions are poor], most children experience infection in early childhood. As a consequence of poor sanitary conditions and hygienic practices, most children (up to 90%) have been infected with the hepatitis A virus before the age of 10. Those infected in childhood do not experience any noticeable symptoms. Consequently epidemics are uncommon because older children and adults are generally immune. Symptomatic disease rates in these areas are low and outbreaks are rare.

In developing countries, countries with transitional economies and regions where sanitary conditions are variable, children often escape infection in early childhood. Ironically, these improved economic and sanitary conditions may lead to a higher susceptibility in older age groups and, [because infections that occur in adolescents and adults are more often symptomatic,] higher disease rates and large outbreaks can occur.

According to Wikipedia, the Maulana Azad Medical College (MAMC) is a government medical college in Delhi affiliated with the University of Delhi. It is named after an Indian freedom fighter and the 1st education minister of independent India. It is located at Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg, New Delhi. MAMC is one of India's premier medical colleges and consistently ranked amongst the top 5 medical colleges in the country. - Mod.CP
