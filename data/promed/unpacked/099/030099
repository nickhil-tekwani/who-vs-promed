Veterinary scientists are investigating a mystery disease, which is
killing young cattle across Scotland. There have been 25 confirmed
cases of bleeding calf Syndrome, which attacks animals less than one
month old.

Experts at the Scottish Agricultural College (SAC) said there had
been an unexplained upsurge of the little-known but fatal disease.

Affected calves can have a persistent fever and develop serious
bleeding from orifices and internally. The cause of the illness is
unknown but poisoning, genetic abnormalities, and drug reactions are
being considered.

The SAC scientists are working with colleagues at the Royal (Dick)
Veterinary School and the Veterinary Laboratories Agency to discover
what is behind the outbreak.

In order to learn more they are offering a free of charge post-mortem
service to farmers and vets who have suspected cases.

Up to the end of August [2009] there were more than 25 confirmed
cases from 18 farms in Scotland, with nearly 90 percent of these
being seen in traditional beef herds.

Cases have been seen in the south east and south west of the country
as well as in Fife, Perthshire, and around Inverness and Aberdeen.

In England and Wales a similar number of cases have been identified
but these have been almost exclusively in dairy herds.

[A rather similar syndrome has been reported from Germany since the
beginning of 2009 (see references below). According to information
kindly provided by Sabine Zentis, the cases in Germany are clustered,
with the majority notified from regions in Bavaria and North
Rhine-Westphalia. Various etiologic scenarios have been hypothesized,
such as the 3 included in the BBC item above. Also, acute bracken
poisoning and 3 others mentioned in an article of the German weekly
Der Spiegel of 27 Mar 2009, cited in posting 20090329.1214:
"vaccines, genetically modified feed, or perhaps even the 1st
mother's milk"... The list of possible causes or contributing
factors, both infectious as well as non-infectious, may be longer.

Any complementary/additional information, in particular addressing
laboratory findings, will help. - Mod.AS]
