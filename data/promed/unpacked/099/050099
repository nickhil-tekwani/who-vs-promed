Measles outbreak update
-----------------------
The number of positive measles IgM specimens increased markedly during
September [2009] with 246 positive cases compared to 99 in August [2009],
bringing the total for the year to 414. The majority (372; 90 per cent) of
these patients were from Gauteng. Of the Gauteng patients, 296 (80 per
cent) were from the Tshwane district. During the past month, however, there
have been 35 and 31 cases in Ekurhuleni and Johannesburg, respectively.
Ages were known for 405 patients (98 per cent) and ranged from 2 months to
54 years with a median of 12 years.

There is a broad differential diagnosis for patients presenting with fever
and morbilliform rash, particularly in teenagers and young adults. Measles
is often not considered. During this outbreak, a number of patients were
initially misdiagnosed as having Coxsackie [virus] infections. All patients
presenting at health facilities with suspected measles should be isolated
on admission to prevent nosocomial spread. If a diagnosis of measles is
suspected (fever over 39 degrees C [102.2 degrees F], rash, and one of the
following: cough, coryza, conjunctivitis), together with a possible history
of contact with a confirmed measles case, a blood and urine/throat swab
should be taken, and the new measles case investigation form should be
completed by the person diagnosing the patient. It is important to indicate
the date of onset of rash, the demographic details, age, and physical
address of the patient for follow-up purposes and outbreak response. The
measles case investigation form should accompany the specimens on ice to
the National Institute for Communicable Diseases, the regional
WHO-accredited laboratory. All specimens submitted to the NICD are tested
at no charge (the private sector included) as part of the National Expanded
Programme on Immunisation surveillance.

All close household contacts of the patient should receive a measles
vaccination (excluding pregnant women) within 72 hours of contact -- this
may provide some protection against measles infection. This primary
vaccination response should occur prior to the availability of the results,
to prevent as much spread as possible. Once a positive result is notified
by the laboratory, further investigation of possible spread should be
conducted and wider outbreak response vaccination offered, such as in
schools and creches. All positive cases should be notified to the local
authority health services' Communicable Disease Control directorates, as
required under the Health Act.

the data by week suggest that the outbreak in Gauteng provnce has now peaked.
