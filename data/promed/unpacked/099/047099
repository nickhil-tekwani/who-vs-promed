As part of routine monitoring carried out by the City of Denton in partnership with the University of North Texas, mosquitoes were trapped and collected on 3 May 2016 from traps located in Denton at Gay Drive on West University Drive. These mosquitoes were sent to the Texas Department of State Health Services (TDSHS) for analysis. On 10 May [2016], TDSHS notified the City of Denton that 1 of these mosquitoes tested positive for California serogroup viruses. According to the information provided by the City of Denton (presumably from the TDSHS), viruses from this serogroup have only been identified from 5 mosquito pools since 2009.

The floodwater mosquito collected 3 May 2016 with the detected California serogroup viruses was _Aedes trivittatus_. The City of Denton claims to have historically captured since 2003 an average of 22 _Aedes trivittatus_ mosquitoes per season (0.3 per cent of total captured mosquitoes).

Regarding the virus type, the mosquito sample has been sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for identification. Results of testing are pending.

The Denton Department of Health and Human Services has sent a positive sample of the California serogroup virus to CDC to confirm the virus type. As Denton is currently at a Risk Level 2, which is Enhanced Response, they are setting additional traps at the Rayzor Ranch site and all captured mosquitoes will be tested for presence of the virus, as well as surrounding North Texas trap sites. Based on the results given by CDC, Denton County will plan additional measures beyond minimizing the mosquito population and avoidance of exposure (both residents and city officials). Until more is known, it is estimated that the probability of an individual contracting the virus is low. In previous years, human cases of California serogroup viruses in Texas included 1 case in 2010 and 3 in 2012. No human cases have currently been reported.

[The earlier request for information (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20160521.4237160) asking for information about the species of mosquito from which the California serogroup virus was isolated in Denton, Texas, has now been swiftly answered -- _Aedes trivitattus_ -- thanks to the 2 EpiCore responding members. Of note, the above report indicates that this species constitutes a tiny percentage of their mosquito collections -- just 22 individuals per season and 0.3 per cent of their total catch. It will be interesting to learn if any additional mosquitoes with the virus are detected as the transmission season progresses. California serogroup bunyaviruses can be transovarially transmitted, which may explain the detection of the virus this early in the season. It will be of considerable interest to know the identity of the virus, when that has been determined. - Mod.TY
