Abstract
--------
Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) continues to be a cause of death in Europe. Our aim was to describe the clinical and histopathological features of fatal HFRS in the Udmurt Republic (Udmurtia), located in the European part of Russia. This retrospective observational study included all fatal cases of HFRS that occurred in Udmurtia from January 2010 through December 2019. The most relevant clinical and autopsy data of these cases were recorded through a review of the patients' medical records and autopsy reports. During 2010-2019, Udmurtia had 41 fatal cases of HFRS [among] a total of 10 312 confirmed cases (case fatality rate of 0.4%). Twenty-seven patients died in hypotensive and oliguric phases of HFRS due to refractory septic shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Fourteen patients died in the polyuric phase of the disease from complications of acute kidney injury or because of hospital-acquired bacterial infections. Multiorgan involvement was noted in all autopsies with variable degrees of generalized venous congestion, interstitial edema, capillary wall thickening, perivascular deposition of plasma proteins, microthrombosis formation, and perivascular hemorrhage. The more prominent histopathological features were seen in kidneys, lungs, and hypophysis.

Discussion
----------
This retrospective observational study provides some insights into fatal HFRS in the area endemic to [Puumala virus] (PUUV.) The case fatality rate of HFRS in Udmurtia (0.4%) was much higher than that reported in another European hotspot of HFRS, where Germany and Finland had case fatality rates of 0.05 and 0.08%, respectively. This difference may be attributed to 3 reasons. First, it can be explained by the known genetic diversity of PUUV. 2nd, since only hospitalized patients are tested for HFRS in Russia, the real case fatality rate is probably lower because of an unknown number of milder cases. 3rd, unfortunately, national clinical guidelines for the management of HFRS have some disagreements with international standards of care for the management of septic shock, ARDS, and acute kidney injury. In fact, examples of noncompliance with evidence-based guidelines were often registered in fatal cases.

Between 2010 and 2019, there was temporal variation in case fatality rate, with some tendency for decreased fatalities during years of high incidence. One of the explanations for this variation could be related to more awareness of medical staff regarding the management of critically ill patients with HFRS in high incidence settings.

The clinical and autopsy findings were consistent with the pathophysiology of the disease, which involves immune mediated systemic microvascular endothelial dysfunction with capillary leakage (including, probably due to VEGF-induced endothelial hyperpermeability) and thrombohemorrhagic complications, eventually leading to septic shock, ARDS, and AKI. There were 2 distinct clinical patterns of fatal cases. Most patients died early in their disease due to refractory septic shock and/or ARDS as a result of microcirculatory dysfunction with increased vascular permeability. None of these patients had signs of severe AKI. Later in the disease, patients died from complications of AKI, including hemorrhagic complications of RRT or because of hospital-acquired bacterial infections. However, these patients showed no clinical signs of severe capillary leakage at the time of death.

To conclude, the commonest causes of death in patients with HFRS in the area endemic to PUUV were related to septic shock and ARDS, which occurred early in the disease. It should not be expected that any current antiviral therapy would be effective in the prevention of fatal complications on the 1st days of the disease. A more reasonable assumption is that the reduction of the case fatality rate of HFRS can be achieved by developing evidence-based protocols for supportive management of severe forms of the disease.

[Although the cases evaluated occurred between 2010-2019, the results of this study provide a series of clinical and autopsy findings on a substantial number of HFRS cases that occurred in a single locality, the Udmurt Republic (Udmurtia) in European Russia. The authors state that reported cases of HFRS in Udmurtia are caused only by PUUV which usually causes a relatively mild form of HFRS.
