[Following the publication of Australia's 1st report on varroosis, affecting Asiatic honey bee ("eastern honey bee", _Apis cerana_), we have received the following 2 messages from Australia's veterinary Services.]

The species of mite identified in a single hive of feral Asian honey bees at Townsville port is _Varroa jacobsoni_, NOT _Varroa destructor_.

Additionally _V. destructor_ is not a synonym of _V. jacobsoni_, they are 2 separate, but closely related species only separated in 2000 by Anderson and Trueman [see reference in item 2]. Hence prior to 2000, outside of Asia, specimens of _V. destructor_ were misidentified as _V. jacobsoni_.

Whereas in this instance the species that we are dealing with, is correctly identified as _V. jacobsoni_. Currently the diagnosis has been done by morphological techniques and it is expected that this will be confirmed shortly by molecular diagnostics. This identification is further supported by the host species (_Apis cerana_ rather than _A. mellifera_) and the source and location of the host species on which it was found.

Australia remains free of _Varroa destructor_.

Further to my earlier correspondence, we now have the results of genotype analysis of the _Varroa jacobsoni_ mites detected at Townsville port.

These results confirm that the mites are _V. jacobsoni_ belonging to the Java/PNG haplotype and not _V. destructor_.

I would welcome a correction in ProMED mail.

[We are grateful to Australia's CVO for the above information clarifying the definite identity of the Varroa mite involved in the described event.

Australia notified the OIE on 1 Jul 2016 the identification of the causal agent as _Varroa jacobsoni_. The report included the following epidemiological comments:

"Asian honey bee (_Apis cerana_) hive detected in the Port of Townsville, destroyed on 27 Jun 2016. Dead bees and comb submitted for testing on the same day to the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources, Operational Science Program, in Brisbane. Varroa species was detected. _Varroa jacobsoni_ was confirmed morphologically by CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation), Black Mountain, Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, on 30 Jun 2016. Molecular analysis is currently being undertaken. Genetic studies of the hive will be carried out to determine the possible origin of the bees. Further surveillance work, since 27 Jun 2016, has not resulted in further detections of Asian honey bee (_Apis cerana_). Along with surveillance, communication and awareness activities within the community and industry are being undertaken".

_Apis cerana_, the Asian honey bee occurs across south and southeastern Asia up to Russia in the north. Its natural distribution extends to Japan and stretches as far west as Afghanistan. This species is a natural host to 2 major honey bee pests, _Varroa destructor_ and _Nosema ceranae_, both of which also infect _Apis mellifera_ (the European honey bee). _Apis cerana_ was introduced intentionally into Papua New Guinea in the late 1970s. Subsequently, it continued to expand its range into the Solomon Islands and Australia. The Australian government has begun educational programs to teach the identification of _Apis cerana_, and destruction of identified wild nests is common practice in efforts to cease its spread within the country. However, the Asian honey bee seems to be well established in tropical and subtropical Queensland (northeastern Australia).

According to OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals, chapter 2.2.7 "Varroosis" (updated 2008), the mites responsible for the (reportable) condition of varroosis or varroatosis are the species _Varroa destructor_, which have now been definitely excluded by the molecular analysis. Since the cited Manual's text opens with the statement "The mite _Varroa destructor_ (formerly _Varroa jacobsoni_)" without further detail, this may have caused some confusion which has now, hopefully, been put straight. According to the provided evidence, Australia retains its freedom of _Varroa Destructor_.

Australia's Ministry of Agriculture has the following information, related to Varroosis, published on its web-site http://www.agriculture.gov.au/pests-diseases-weeds/bees:

"Varroa mite - the major threat to Australia's honey bee and honey bee crop pollination plant industries.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Australia is one of the few countries in the world to remain free of varroa mite (_Varroa destructor_). If varroa mite were to become established in Australia our healthy population of feral honey bees, and the pollination services they provide, could be reduced by 90-100 percent. Restrictions may be put in place on the movement of hives to limit the spread of varroa, which could reduce the availability of hives in some regions. The effects would be significant for apiarists, who would face higher costs to manage their hives, and producers of crops such as almonds, apples and cherries that rely on pollination from bees.

The Australian Government has developed a 'continuity strategy' to ensure that the honey bee and honey-bee-pollination-responsive crop industries, relevant research organisations and all Australian governments are well prepared; the 'continuity strategy' guidelines are available at http://www.agriculture.gov.au/pests-diseases-weeds/bees/honey-bee-pollination-continuity-strategy
