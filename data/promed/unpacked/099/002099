Mosquito bite warning after virus rise
--------------------------------------
Health authorities are warning people to protect themselves against
mosquito bites following a 3-fold increase in mosquitoborne viruses in the
1st 2 months of the year. There were 380 cases of Ross River virus in New
South Wales (NSW) in January and February 2008, up from 78 for the same
period last year. Barmah Forest virus cases almost doubled to 121 over the
same period, and more are expected this month [March 2008] as the mosquito
season peaks. Recent rainfall has been blamed for the explosion in mosquito
numbers and cases of the viruses, which cause debilitating symptoms such as
tiredness, sore and swollen joints, rashes, and fever.

NSW Health director of communicable diseases Jeremy McAnulty said people
must ensure pools of stagnant water, which are ripe breeding grounds for
mosquitoes, are cleaned up around houses and backyards. He urged people
with water tanks to cover them with a fine steel mesh to prevent the laying
of eggs in the tanks.

The potentially fatal Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEV) has been
detected in mosquitoes and chickens in Griffith, Leeton, and the Macquarie
Marshes. In rare cases the virus can also be transmitted to humans by
mosquitoes, causing permanent brain damage and death.

"There have been no human MVEV infection cases to date, however the
monitoring program results means there may be the potential for people to
become infected if bitten by a mosquito," Mr McAnulty said. He urged people
travelling throughout the state over Easter to take precautions such as
wearing insect repellent and loose clothing; and avoiding going outside
around dusk and dawn particularly when fishing, camping, or bush-walking.

University of Sydney medical entomologist Cameron Webb said in NSW mosquito
control had been sporadic. He said the Department of Medical Entomology at
Westmead Hospital has developed an awareness program for the Hunter area to
alert residents and holiday makers to times when mosquitoes are most active.

[Ross River virus and Barmah Forest virus are similar viruses
(alphaviruses) classified in the family _Togaviridae_, whereas Murray
Valley encephalitis virus is unrelated and classified in the family
_Flaviviridae_.

Epidemics of benign polyarthritis were recorded in Australia as early as
1927, and the etiologic agent, Ross River virus, was isolated in 1963. Ross
River virus was shown to be a mosquito-transmitted virus belonging to the
genus _Alphavirus_ of the family _Togaviridae_. Ross River virus is endemic
in most coastal regions of Australia and since the 1980's appears to have
extended its geographical range to include most of the island communities
of the South Pacific. The animal reservoir species are various, and humans
exhibit a significant viraemia such that some epidemics are maintained in a
human-mosquito-human transmission cycle. The mosquito vectors vary
according to the local environment. Fortunately, illness in humans --
although occasionally prolonged and painful -- is not fatal, and recovery
is complete.

Barmah Forest virus accounts for about 10 per cent of cases of epidemic
polyarthritis in Australia. This virus appears to be restricted to
Australia where it causes diseases clinically similar to Ross River virus.
Mammals and marsupials are believed to be the reservoir hosts and the virus
has been isolated from several mosquito species. Human cases of illness
occur sporadically with the majority of cases reported from Queensland.

Murray Valley encephalitis occurs as a zoonosis in Australia and New
Guinea. Murray Valley encephalitis virus is believed to be maintained in a
natural cycle involving water birds and mosquitoes. It is closely related
to Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, and St Louis encephalitis
virus and the clinical presentation is similar; fever, myalgia, nausea and
vomiting. There are often early signs of CNS involvement and patients who
progress to coma generally have a poor outcome developing respiratory
paralysis followed by neck, limb and speech impairment. Fatalities may
occur as the result of brain damage or secondary infection. The inapparent
to apparent infection ratio is about 500:1, and the case fatality rate is
about 20 per cent.

Presently there are no vaccines for the control of these virus infections.
