Kenya: Five more die of Rift Valley fever
-----------------------------------------
Five people, including 4 members of a family died of the dreaded Rift
Valley fever (RVF) in the Tana River and Baringo districts. The 5
died as the Ministry of Health warned Kenyans against handling
animals suspected to be infected with the disease.
Dr. Jack Nyamongo of the National Public Health Laboratory
Services/National Blood Transfusion Services said it was important
not to handle material from infected animals. He said veterinary
officers at Kabete were testing samples from a cow confiscated in
Ruai at the weekend to establish if the animal was infected with the
deadly virus.
Last evening [11 Feb 2007], the Director of Veterinary Services, Dr.
Joseph Musaa, said initial results indicated that the cow was
suffering from Lumpy Skin disease. [Lumpy skin disease is caused by a
poxvirus classified in the genus _Capripoxvirus_, which affects
certain breeds and crossbreeds of cattle in Africa. - Mod.CP].
The 4 family members succumbed to the killer fever after attending a
traditional wedding in the Tana River on Mon 12 Feb 2007. The victims
developed symptoms of the disease before bleeding to death barely 2
days after feasting on camel meat at a wedding ceremony in Anole
village, Madogo division. Three of the victims died in manyattas
[fenced settlements of several huts characteristic of Masai
communities. - Mod.CP], while the 4th was pronounced dead on arrival
at Garissa Provincial General Hospital, where 21 other villagers were
hospitalised.
North Eastern Provincial Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Omar Ahmed,
said more than 20 other villagers who attended the weekend function
had been put under observation after developing symptoms of the
disease. He said most of the affected villagers were treated [and]
subjected to periodic check-ups. Three of them were admitted to an
isolation unit in the facility. Omar regretted that most of the fresh
cases reported over the last 2 weeks followed disregard of the
slaughter ban. Madogo DO [District Officer], Mr. George Omolo, said
villagers reported the matter after 3 of the women who prepared the
camel meat collapsed and bled to death.
Preliminary reports indicated that the camel had been bought, Omolo
said. He said the pastoralist who sold the animal was among those
retained for specialised treatment at the hospital. Panicky
villagers, including those who ate cooked meat thronged local health
centres to establish their RVF status.
This brings to 114 the number of deaths reported in northern Kenya
since the outbreak of the disease, 2 months ago. In Baringo District
an 18-year-old man died bringing the death toll in the area to 16.
Medical Officer of Health, Dr. George Otieno, said the man who had
been receiving treatment at Kimalel Health Centre died on Saturday
[10 Feb 2007]. Nationally, 150 people have died of the disease in the
past 2 months.
Otieno said a team of health workers had been dispatched to the
affected villages in the Marigat and Kiserian divisions to fight the
disease. He identified the most affected villages where the fever has
taken its toll as Ngambo location, Sindan, Sandai, Logumgum, and
Salabani all in the Marigat division, and some parts of the Mukutani
division.
He said the government has supplied the district with 500 mosquito
nets and insecticides. But Otieno said the chemicals were still lying
at chemical stores in Kabarnet town, as the Government has not
released money to hire casual workers to spray houses in the affected
areas.
Baringo Central MP, Mr. Gideon Moi, visited patients in the Kimalel
and Marigat sub-district hospitals and distributed more than 2000
mosquito nets.
At the same time, farmers in Nakuru have asked the Government to
declare the fever a national disaster. Farmers meeting in Nakuru
yesterday [11 Feb 2007] criticised the Livestock Development ministry
[for the way it] handled the matter.
Meanwhile, fear of the disease spreading in Meru Central have led to
an order of closure of all abattoirs and butcheries in the area.
District veterinary officer, Dr. Daniel Karugu, said samples from
several suspected cows are being analysed. Neighbouring districts of
Isiolo, Meru North, and Meru South have reported cases of the disease.

fever virus infection has risen now to 150, the majority (114)
