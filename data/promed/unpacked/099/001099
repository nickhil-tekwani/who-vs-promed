Cholera in the Orinoco Delta of Venezuela
[from an article by Armando Gruber, El Nacional of Caracas, 25 April 1997]
Eighteen positive cases of cholera have been identified among more than 117
indigenous communities of the Warao tribe in the sectors of Pedernales,
Nabasunuka, Berejina and Guayo. This brings the total to 165 cases in four
months. In a state of extreme alert, groups of epidemiologists together
with Warao translators have been directed to the above high risk areas to
prevent expansion of the disease in the many waterways of the delta region.
There is an attempt to isolate identified cases to minimize the spread of
disease. The chief epidemiologist of the Delta government, Reinaldo
Marquez, explained that they are attempting to prevent the spread of other
diseases by providing 5,000 units of vaccine against other common diseases
including tetanus, polio, diphtheria, pertussis, and tuberculosis. The
Warao live in relatively poor conditions, and they routinely eat raw fish
and shrimp, which has contributed to the spread of disease in areas
inaccessible to public health workers.
