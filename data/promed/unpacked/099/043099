Suspected contamination with the bacterium "Clostridium botulinum"
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Further to questions from the public, hereby additional information:
It is of importance to stress that there is no evidence for the presence of
the said bacterium in the product. The recall has been carried out as a
precautionary, preventive measure and will be in force until the laboratory
investigations are completed. The Canadian health authorities have not
reported any morbidity related to the bacterium; in addition, they have not
detected the toxin which might be produced by the bacterium and cause disease.
Food products which might contain the bacterium are not distinguishable by
taste, structure, color or smell from normal products -- hence the need for
precaution, until investigations are complete. Consumers are recommended to
destroy purchased packings or return them to the shop. A person feeling
unwell after eating Meytal gefilte fish packed in 400 grams trays ,should
refer immediately to the physician.

[We have been informed by the Israeli Ministry of Health (MOH) that their
recall followed information on the recall of same product in Canada (see
ref below). Samples have been sent for investigation to the Department of
Bacteriology, the Kimron Veterinary Institute, Beit-Dagan. - Mod. AS]
[It should be emphasized that to date there have been no illnesses reported
in association with this product, but given the nature and severity of the
possibility of botulism, this recall information has been posted.
We have also learned (from the grapevine) that the information on the
Canadian recall was obtained from the ProMED-mail posting referenced
below. We at ProMED-mail are pleased to receive feedback on the impact of
dissemination of information through our subscriber network and
