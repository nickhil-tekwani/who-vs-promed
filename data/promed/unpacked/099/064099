When a team of dermatologists arrived in the city [Chennai, Tamil Nadu state] from Tiruvannamalai to pitch in with relief efforts, they came equipped to attend to rain-related infections. What they didn't anticipate to see [were] people suffering from leprosy -- no more considered a public health problem. Worse, the patients were unaware they had the potentially crippling disease.

As doctors screen those hit by the flood, they are seeing a lot more than just rain-related maladies. They are also seeing people with symptoms of TB [tuberculosis], which, like leprosy, is a notifiable disease.

Dr K R John, professor and head of the community medicine department at Sri Ramachandra Medical College Hospital, is among a group of doctors who have been seeing such cases. "The sad part is many of them haven't sought medical help before. They come to us only because we are easily accessible now and they will get medicines free," he said. John said he saw suspected TB cases in Mannivakkam.

Experts say this has exposed the loopholes in the screening camps the Chennai corporation and the directorate of public health claim they routinely hold.
