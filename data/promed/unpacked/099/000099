[1] South Carolina (Pickens County): fox, human exposure

One person has been referred to a health care provider for preventive treatment after being exposed to rabies by a fox that tested positive for the disease in the Liberty area of Pickens County, state health officials reported today [27 Jun 2014].

The fox is the 3rd animal to test positive this year [2014] in Pickens County, according to the Department of Health and Environmental Control. One animal in the county tested positive in 2013.

"If you think you have been exposed to the rabies virus through a bite, scratch, or the saliva of a possibly infected animal, immediately wash the affected area with plenty of soap and water," said Sandra Craig of DHEC's Bureau of Environmental Health Services. "Then be sure to get medical attention and report the incident to DHEC."

Craig said people should avoid wild animals acting tame and tame animals acting wild. "About 275 South Carolinians must undergo preventive treatment for rabies every year, with most exposures coming from bites or scratches by a rabid or suspected rabid animal," Craig said in a statement. "Wild animals transmit the disease most often, but domestic pets can contract rabies as well." State law requires pet owners to have their pets regularly vaccinated against rabies, she said.

There were 124 confirmed cases of rabies in animals during 2013 in South Carolina. There have been 58 confirmed cases in animals statewide this year [2014]. More information about rabies, visit http://www.scdhec.gov/rabies or http://www.cdc.gov/rabies/.

[2] Georgia (Wilmington Island, Chatham County): feline, raccoon suspected, human exposure

Officials confirmed on [Wed 18 Jun 2014], at least 8 exposures to a rabid feral cat on Wilmington Island [Chatham County] that could lead to a spread of the virus in the area.

According to a report from the Coastal Health District, the kitten was being fed by several neighbors in the Wilmington Park area and has since tested positive for rabies.

Health officials have advised those exposed to contact their healthcare provider. It is possible that the kitten got rabies after being exposed to a potentially rabid raccoon.

Savannah Chatham Animal Control is attempting to capture the raccoon along with up to 6 other cats in the same neighborhood that may have been exposed to the rabid kitten. Chatham County Health Department Environmental Health Division and Savannah Chatham Animal Control said that they wanted to remind residents to always avoid contact with wild or stray animals, watch for unusual behavior in pets and wildlife, and get pets vaccinated against rabies.

Animal Control officers are advising anyone in the area that had such contact with the kitten, a raccoon, or other animal, to contact the control offices.

Rabies is a potentially deadly virus that is primarily spread by infected animals. Signs of rabies in animals include a change in behavior, biting, aggression, showing no fear of natural enemies (such as humans), foaming at the mouth, and paralysis. [There are 2 forms of rabies, furious, as described here, and the commonly called dumb rabies. Dumb rabies is where a normally energetic or aggressive animal is quiet and passive. - Mod.TG]

The Chatham County Health Department Environmental Health Division offers these tips to protect you and your family from rabies:
- avoid contact with animals you don't know;
- make sure your pets receive the proper immunizations. Dogs and cats should get rabies vaccines by 4 months of age, followed by a booster shot 1 year later, and another one every 1-3 years as prescribed by your veterinarian;
- do not handle, feed, or unintentionally attract wild animals with open garbage cans or by leaving pet food out at night. Never adopt wild animals or bring them into your home. Do not try to nurse sick animals to health. Call animal control or a properly licensed animal rescue agency for assistance;
- teach children to never handle unfamiliar animals, wild or domestic, even if they appear friendly. "Love your own, leave other animals alone" is a good principle for children to learn.

Officials said that anyone who gets bitten by an animal should seek medical care immediately and contact Chatham County Animal Control and the Chatham County Health Department Environmental Health Division.

[3] Pennsylvania (Adams County): feline, human exposure

Adams County has its 1st confirmed case of rabies in a human this year [2014], according to the Adams County SPCA [Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals].

A woman, whose name was not released, was attacked 1 Jun 2014 by a stray cat in the 400 block of Sibert Road in Straban Township. The cat attacked the woman in her yard and bit her in the leg and hand, said Abigail Avery, shelter manager and humane society police officer with the SPCA.

The victim was sent to Hanover Hospital, where she was treated and immediately started on rabies vaccinations. She is expected to make a full recovery because she started treatment right away, Avery said. Rabies can be fatal for people who are bitten and do not get treatment.

The cat was sent to a lab in Harrisburg where it tested positive for rabies. The cat had to be put down because animals can only be tested for rabies when they are deceased, Avery said. A veterinarian has to test a section of the animal's brain.

The victim made the choice to put down all of her outside, stray cats -- about 20 in total -- because they were not vaccinated, Avery said.

Rabies is a deadly viral disease affecting humans and animals, both domestic and wild animals. It is a virus that is completely impartial, affecting large animals (horses, cattle), as well as companion animals (cats, dogs), and humans. It is a virus affecting almost all mammals. The age of the animal makes no difference and it is deadly.

People should be extremely cautious around any animal acting out of the ordinary. Some animals may be vicious and aggressive; some may be quiet and passive when they are normally more active.

A rabies test on an animal requires the death of the animal, as the brain is what is required for testing. The safest way to protect your pets, large or small, from this virus is to vaccinate them. Vaccinated pets are also safer for owners as it builds a barrier between you and the disease.

Communities such as the ones in these articles need to be having rabies drives to encourage people to get their animals vaccinated. - Mod.TG]
