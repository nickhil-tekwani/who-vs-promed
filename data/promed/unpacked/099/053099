An elephant calf died of anthrax in the Sanasole cashew forest on the foothills of Similipal sanctuary [Mayurbhanj district, Odisha], officials said on [Sat 15 Oct 2016]. The carcass was located last evening with blood oozing out of its mouth, said Arun Kumar Patra, Assistant Conservator of Forest (ACF) of Baripada forest division.

The calf died of anthrax and the cause of the death was ascertained after [a necropsy], he said

A herd of elephants had strayed away from the Similipal sanctuary area last week and the animals were seen roaming in the nearby areas. The calf which succumbed to anthrax was a member of the herd. The mother of the calf was seen guarding the carcass when the forest officials visited the spot, the ACF said.

The [necropsy] was carried out after the guarding mother left the carcass this morning [15 Oct 2016]. On [10 Sep 2016], a female elephant died of anthrax in Gudugudia range under Karanjia forest division, officials said.

[Suckling juveniles of whichever species are rarely reported suffering from anthrax. What is more usual is that they die of starvation after their mother died of anthrax. But in this case the dam was unaffected. Assuming that the diagnosis was correct -- and we have yet to hear of laboratory confirmation -- it is a puzzler. Logically it might have been from a haemophagic biting fly.

Such deaths have been described anecdotally by James Howard Williams in his 1950 memoir of elephant experiences, Elephant Bill. He had gone out to Burma in 1920 to work for a British Teak company and among other skills became a recognised expert in elephant management. He set up a vaccination programme using the Pasteur vaccine. The Bombay Burmah Trading Corporation Ltd had 31 Bombay Burmaf elephants die of anthrax in 1919-20, 91 deaths in 1923-24, and 60 in 1927-28; ref Vicki Constantine Croke 2013. Elephant Company, Random House, p. 139 and endnote.
