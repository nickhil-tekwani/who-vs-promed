Tomato spotted wilt virus targeted
----------------------------------
During the past 2 decades, TSWV has spread around the world by
thrips [small insects that feed on plants], causing very high losses
to a variety of vegetable, ornamental, and agronomic crops.
According to Steve Olson, a professor at University of Florida's
North Florida Research & Education in Quincy, TSWV epidemics
have been troublesome throughout the southern United States,
cutting yields by 20-30 percent on tomatoes. Tomato and pepper
crops in Florida and Georgia, valued at about $1 billion annually,
have been hit hard, as have peanut crops.
Leaves of TSWV-infected plants turn brown, purple, or bronze and
stem tips are frequently killed. Infected tomato fruits show spots and
rings, and are unmarketable.
The virus is transmitted from plant to plant almost exclusively by
several species of thrips. The western flower thrips (_Frankliniella
occidentalis_) and the tobacco thrips (_F. fusca_) are major
species in Florida.
Until recently, growers sprayed toxic, broad-spectrum insecticides
in an attempt to control thrips, but the chemicals do not prevent virus
transmission. The solution, according to researchers at the Quincy
center, is to use a variety of new, environmentally friendly
strategies known as integrated pest management (IPM).
IPM includes new cultural practices, natural insecticides, bio-
control agents or natural predators, and a new treatment that
boosts the plant's resistance system against viral and bacterial
pathogens.
According to Tim Momol, an assistant professor of plant pathology
at the Quincy center, incidence of TSWV infection in tomato has
been reduced by as much as 75 percent, using a new plastic bed
cover that reflects UV light and repels thrips.
He said that many producers have switched to the UV-reflective
mulch, boosting tomato yields by as much as 600 (25-pound)
boxes/acre and increasing profits by as much as $4000/acre.
Although the reflective mulch costs an extra $200/acre, yield
increases and higher returns justify its use.
According to Joe Funderburk, a professor of entomology at the
Quincy center, a recent survey showed that about 30 percent of
the growers in north Florida and Georgia are using the UV-
reflective mulch, and its use is expanding to other production areas
in the Southeast in 2003.
He says a natural insecticide called spinosad, which poses little
threat to field workers or the environment, also is helping growers
control thrips on tomatoes. And, a new resistance-boosting
treatment, which is marketed under the Actigard (R)* trademark, is
now being used by about 45 percent of all tomato growers in the
region. [*Reference to this product does not constitute an

Olson, Momol, and Funderburk developed and promoted the new
IPM control measures, and the researchers are collaborating
internationally so that the program is adopted in other countries.

[This piece reports an interesting application of IPM. Spinosad is a
mixture of 2 of the most active, naturally occurring metabolites
(spinosyns A and D) produced by the soil-inhabiting actinomycete
_Saccharopolyspora spinosa_. They have been registered by EPA
to control a variety of insects. Upon ingestion of the spinosyns,
death follows due to extremely rapid excitation of the insect nervous
system. - Mod.DH]
