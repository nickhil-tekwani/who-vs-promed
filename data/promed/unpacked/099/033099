_Meloidogyne chitwoodi_ and _M. fallax_ detected in France
----------------------------------------------------------
The NPPO [National Plant Protection Organisation] of France recently
informed the EPPO Secretariat about the detection of _Meloidogyne
chitwoodi_ and _M. fallax_ (both EPPO A2 List) on its territory.

In 2008, _M. chitwoodi_ and _M. fallax_ were detected in Picardie
region on black salsify (_Scorzonera hispanica_) and ware potatoes.
Surveys on vegetable crops carried out in 2009 detected an outbreak of
_M. chitwoodi_ and _M. fallax_ in Bretagne on glasshouse vegetables
(tomatoes and lettuce).

It is suspected that these outbreaks resulted from the import of
infested young plants from countries where the nematodes occur.

_Globodera rostochiensis_ - update on the Canadian situation (2010)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has completed all potato
cyst nematode (PCN) soil sampling and testing of the 2010 seed potato
crop. Over 43 200 soil samples were collected and analysed as part of
Canada's 2010 national PCN detection survey.

The CFIA, with the support of Canadian seed potato growers and other
stakeholders, has tested approximately 80 percent of the entire 2010
Canadian seed potato production area and PCN was not detected. The
golden nematode, _Globodera rostochiensis_, is considered present in
some areas and subject to official control in Canada.

Eradication of _Globodera rostochiensis_ from Western Australia
---------------------------------------------------------------
In Western Australia, _Globodera rostochiensis_ (EPPO A2 List) was
detected for the 1st time in 1986 and an eradication programme was
implemented. From 1986 to 1989, _G. rostochiensis_ was detected on 6
properties near Perth (covering approximately 15 ha/37 acres).

All infested sites were intensively fumigated, phytosanitary
regulations were implemented to prevent any further spread, and all
potato crops from Western Australia were tested (more than 31 000
tests). Since 1989, _G. rostochiensis_ has not been detected in
Western Australia.

On 13 Sep 2010 and after a 24-year eradication programme, the NPPO of
Australia officially declared that the pest has been eradicated from
Western Australia.

[Root knot nematodes (_Meloidogyne_ species) attack a wide range of
plants and cause significant economic losses in many vegetable and
fruit crops. The genus contains around 70 species and is found
worldwide in tropical and sub-tropical regions in many types of soil.
Symptoms may include stunting, wilting and leaf chlorosis, and large
galls are formed throughout the root system affecting plant vigour and
even killing the host. The pathogens can persist in the soil for years
and are spread by plant material, soil, and mechanical means (for
example contaminated equipment). Once they have been established in an
area, it is difficult to control or eradicate them. Disease management
requires an integrated approach including phytosanitary and cultural
measures, nematicides, and use of resistant crop varieties.

Both golden (_Globodera rostochiensis_, with at least 5 races) and
pale (_G. pallida_) potato cyst nematodes (PCNs) cause serious crop
losses in potato. Other solanaceous crops (such as tomato) and weeds
may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Symptoms on potato include stunting,
yellowing, and wilting of leaves as well as a reduced root system.
PCNs may lead to complete crop failure. Diseased plants first occur in
isolated patches and these become larger with each new crop. The
nematodes can survive in soil for up to 20 years as cysts. Spread
occurs via infected soil, water, wind, or on plant material. Disease
management includes exclusion, long crop rotation with non-host
species, use of crop cultivars resistant to specific PCN races, and
nematicides. These measures can be combined to keep nematode levels
low, but eradication, as reported from Western Australia above, is
extremely difficult.
