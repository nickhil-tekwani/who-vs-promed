Statement to the Press by the Director-general of the WHO, Dr Gro Harlem
Brundtland: World Health Organization Announces Updated Guidance on
Smallpox Vaccination
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
GENEVA: Following the review of guidance on smallpox vaccination I
announced last week, WHO has consulted with our advisory committee
and has updated the official guidance. The conclusion of the review
states that:
"Existing vaccines have proven efficacy but also have a high incidence
of adverse side-effects. The risk of adverse events is sufficiently high
that mass vaccination is not warranted if there is no or little real risk of
exposure. Individual countries that have reason to believe that their
people face an increased risk of smallpox because of deliberate use of
the virus are considering options for increasing their access to vaccines.
The vaccines would be given to people who are at risk of exposure to
smallpox, including health and civil workers, and would be used in a
search and containment exercise should an outbreak occur.
In summary, the guidance is that vaccination of entire populations is
not recommended. The reason for not recommending such mass
vaccination is that there is a risk of severe reactions to the vaccine,
*including death*, and the fact that vaccination can prevent smallpox
even after exposure to the virus.
Up to now the guidance has also stated that only those with suspected
exposure to smallpox or a related virus should be vaccinated. That has
not changed. What has changed is the increasing attention being given
to the extent and quality of existing vaccine stocks, and to the possible
need both to stimulate vaccine production and increase stocks of
vaccine for use in the event of an outbreak. WHO confirms that the
best method of stopping a smallpox outbreak, should it occur, remains
the same Â­- search and containment. That means identifying persons
with smallpox, identifying those people who have been in contact with
them, and vaccinating them.
*People who have been vaccinated in the past are unlikely to develop
the most serious effects of smallpox.*
This advice and background information on smallpox is now being
made available to governments through the WHO web-site
. Along with this advice we are providing Frequently
asked Questions and Answers about smallpox and a smallpox Fact
Sheet with an electronic slide set of training materials on smallpox.
Other information that will be provided to Health Ministers on
request includes a list of vaccine manufacturers that have the potential
to produce smallpox vaccine and the names of laboratories that can
diagnose smallpox. WHO has also re-established a team of technical
experts in smallpox who are available to assist countries in the
investigation and response to outbreaks.
Finally, I want to emphasize that should an outbreak of smallpox be
detected in any country, this should be considered an international
emergency. WHO will help countries to pool available resources so as
to contain the disease as rapidly and effectively as possible."
