Two residents of Turkestan region infected with anthrax
-------------------------------------------------------
Anthrax was detected in 2 residents of the Tyulkubas district of the Turkestan region. This was reported by the Department of Sanitary and Epidemiological Control of the region, BaigeNews.kz reports. One of the patients is being treated in the Akmola region, the other in the Turkestan region. The patients are in stable condition and will soon be discharged from the hospital.

The DSEK said that the meat of sick animals was not bought in the Turkestan region. According to the sick, the meat was brought from the Zhambyl region. Competent authorities are engaged in finding out where and from whom the meat was purchased.

"Dear residents of the region. We urge you to purchase meat and meat products only in verified places with a veterinary certificate. Please do not trust the audio recordings distributed by unknown citizens," the Department of Sanitary and Epidemiological Department of the Turkestan region addressed residents.

At the same time, it stated that the information disseminated over the past few days on WhatsApp regarding anthrax is not true.

Anthrax is a particularly dangerous infectious disease of agricultural and wild animals of all kinds, as well as humans, caused by the bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_. It is characterized by intoxication, the development of serous-hemorrhagic inflammation of the skin, lymph nodes and internal organs.

[Tyulkubas is a district in the Turkestan region located on the south central border of Kazakhstan with Kyrgyzystan (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulkibas_District).

Zhambyl is located in an area of Kazakhstan where livestock anthrax occurs. For a description of Zhambyl, go to http://spktaraz.kz/eng/jambul/ and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jambyl_Region. To confirm we are in the right part of Kazakhstan on the southern border with Kyrgyzstan, go to Zhualy, the paired district (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhualy_District).

As these cases appear to have bought contaminated meat we might assume that they are suffering from cutaneous anthrax, which should respond quickly to medical treatment. As the cases are being treated in 2 different locations, it is likely that they are not family members and bought the meat separately. - Mod.MHJ
