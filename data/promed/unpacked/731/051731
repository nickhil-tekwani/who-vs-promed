There has been a bovine anthrax outbreak in the district of Dolores, Buenos Aires Province. The outbreak was in a group of recently culled yearling calves which had been placed after separation on a pasture of natural grazing. The owners [unfortunately - Mod.MHJ] continue to believe that such animals are too young to be vaccinated and are refractory to infection with _Bacillus anthracis_ and had not had them vaccinated. In one week, 5 died. Their weights were in the 180-220 kg range.

The estancia is in the district of Dolores and had suffered an anthrax outbreak in April 2012; see 20120507.1125538. In that outbreak 82 cows died of anthrax essentially due to an initial misdiagnosis of enterotoxemia. The dams of these calves have been vaccinated with Sterne vaccine.

The Dolores district is an integral part of the rural anthrax surveillance area within the province and has seen 11 percent of the anthrax diagnoses made during the period 1977 to 2013.

[As usual, our thanks to Ramon.

As I have said before, nature is illiterate and pays no attention to beliefs and writing. She does what she does irrespective of them. With an undeniable pasture contamination associated with the 2012 severe outbreak, those calves were going to be exposed. The owner is very lucky that he got away with only 5 yearlings dying (to date).

The reason that some might believe that young stock are resistant to this disease is that anthrax is seen most commonly in adult stock and heifers awaiting their 1st breeding. It comes down to the vigor of grazing. Cows graze by wrapping their tongues around the grazing and yanking it out of the ground, thereby eating some 5-6 lbs of soil each day and by so doing putting themselves at risk. Also, they are bigger black-body attraction targets for biting flies. By definition suckling calves don't graze, though maybe are curious about it. Yearlings are grazing and so are at increasing risk as they grow.

Those who have visited an Argentine estancia in the Pampas have seen what marvelous natural grazing they have, thick and luxurious; I will admit to the temptation to pull out a salad bowl. But if the contamination is above average, those youngsters will be at risk.
