[The following is from an interview with Jalalidin Gaybulinov, the
head of the National Center for Quarantine and Particularly Dangerous
Infections of MOH in Kyrgyzstan.]

There were 74.3 brucellosis cases per 100 000 population in Kyrgyzstan
in 2008, which is slightly less than in 2007 (77.5 per 100 000). The
most affected regions were Jalal-Abad, Talasskoe, Norinskoe [Naryn],
and Issik Kulsoe, with incidence far exceeding [the national average].

Epidemiologists from [the national] center for quarantine and
particularly dangerous infections conducted consultations and carried
out seminars for the affected population. Additionally, patients'
co-payments for treatment have been decreased to the minimum
according to the program of governmental guarantees.

The morbidity among humans is directly associated with the morbidity
among farm animals. There were 5127 brucellosis cases in cattle and
3509 cases in smaller livestock in 2008. Currently, farm animals are
not documented, and there is uncontrolled traffic of animals both
cross-border and inter-province. Infected animals stay in private
yards for months, thus spreading infection to humans and other
animals. Another reason for high brucellosis incidence in farm animals
is incomplete vaccine coverage.

[The numbers provided in this article tell about incidence and not
prevalence, which may be several times higher. The previous article
reported 151.3 brucellosis cases per 100 000 population in the
Norinskoe region and denied a 10 percent prevalence rate coming from
a British Internet source (Brucellosis - Kyrgyzstan (02): (NA)
20090114.0152). However, there could be some difference in
interpretation of the prevalence numbers by British and Kyrgyz
sources. Possibly, the Kyrgyz sources only have yearly new case data,
but the British source addressed point prevalence regardless of
whether they were new or old cases. - Mod.NP]
