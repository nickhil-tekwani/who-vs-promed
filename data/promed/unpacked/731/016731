With regard to the stamping-out method used to try to control and
eradicate the present FMD type O outbreak in Cyprus, one wonders if
immediate vaccination of the susceptible livestock population of the
island has been considered to bring the outbreak quickly under control.

There are no scientific reasons to believe that under the prevailing
conditions of Cyprus stamping-out may be more effective than
vaccination in controlling the disease. Is that not exactly why the
EU promotes vaccination if FMD occurs in the European part of Turkey?

Bans on international export of livestock and livestock products are
the main reasons to resort to stamping out of the disease. It seems
that for Cyprus a wait of 3 more months after the outbreak is under
control by vaccination, rather than by stamping-out, to regain its
FMD-free status is of little consequence.

Vaccinations that were destined for the occupied areas but were used
by Greek Cypriot vets were to blame for the foot-and-mouth [FMD]
outbreak, the European Party ['Evropaiko Komma', a political party
founded 2005. - Mod.AS] claimed yesterday [8 Nov 2007]. The party's
deputy, Rikkos Erotokritou, made the allegations citing sources from
the state's security services. He then praised the government for its
swift reaction in offering the affected farmers the support that they need.

"Although an investigation is underway, it appears that the affair
started with some medicines, vaccinations, which some vets on our
side used on the area's animals and that were provided to them from
the occupied areas," said Erotokritou.

Asked to expand on his accusations, Erotokritou said his party had
received information -- not from the Agriculture Minister but from
security sources -- that the animals had been vaccinated by Greek
Cypriot vets with vaccines that didn't fulfill the necessary criteria
and which possibly contained the virus. These vaccines, he added, had
the occupied areas as their final destination. "But it is being
investigated and nothing has been proved yet," he added.

AKEL's [progressive party of the working people] Yiannakis Thoma, the
chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, said he was aware of the
claims. "There are many reports that these symptoms and these results
could come from animals that were vaccinated by a certain medicine
that was smuggled to the south from the north," Thoma said after
yesterday's [8 Nov 2007] meeting. "All these reports need to be
looked into. We believe that we should assemble a special group of
scientists to investigate if these reports are true." He added that
efforts were being made to locate the specific vaccines to run tests
on them. "However, after this outbreak, most of the farmers would
have destroyed these vaccines."

Agriculture Minister Fotis Fotiou said his ministry was looking into
the matter. "We even asked the scientists at the London laboratory
about the chances of the disease being spread from contaminated
vaccines from the north and they told us that the chances were very
unlikely for FMD to have spread through vaccines," he told reporters.

Meanwhile, MEP [Member of the European Parliament] Marios Matsakis
issued an announcement on Wednesday [7 Nov 2007] pinpointing Surrey's
Pirbright Lab -- the European Lab that said there were no signs of
FMD in the 1st samples sent from Cyprus 2 weeks ago but later
confirmed the disease after others were dispatched -- as a non-credible lab.

"The virus which provoked the FMD pandemic in Britain recently,
according to all indications, came from an error by the Pirbright Lab
of Surrey, the same lab which receives the samples sent for FMD
diagnosis from Cyprus," read the announcement.

Responding to Matsakis, European Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou
said the specific and other labs' safety measures were being re-evaluated.

[The undersigned is unable to refrain from suspecting that the whole
described affaire resulted from the application of (inactivated) FMD
vaccine. If confirmed, the national as well as EU policy and
legislation have been breached. Less plausible, though not (yet)
excluded, there was (legal or illegal) introduction of vaccinated
sheep from a foreign territory. The 3rd scenario, namely the
involvement of a live FMD O virus (either field strain or
vaccine-derived), seems unlikely.

Unfortunately, blaming the Pirbright FMD laboratory for all possible
drawbacks has become trendy; (at least) in this case, such
accusations seem to be groundless. Following the initial clinical
case (suspected -- and, most probably, rightly so -- to be
bluetongue), serum samples were sent to the national laboratory where
bluetongue (tested serologically?) was not confirmed. However, 8
samples out of 25 were found positive by the NSP ELISA test;
antibodies to viral nonstructural proteins (NSPs) are used as
indicators of infection, irrespective of vaccination status. Samples
were forwarded to the OIE (World Organization for Animal Health)
Reference Laboratory at Pirbright. 'Probang' samples (for
virus/antigen detection) were also sent. All results of the tests
carried out at Pirbright were negative, most probably for the simple
reason that there was no virus there. If NSP ELISA was carried out as
well (no information thereof is available), it turned out negative.

The Cypriot authorities then continued sampling and found 3 adjacent
flocks positive by their NSP ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay) test. This time, the serum samples, sent to Pirbright, were
tested by the (time consuming) neutralization test (NT) and found
positive. Contrary to NSP ELISA, which excludes post-vaccination
antibodies, NT will not differentiate between post-infection and
post-vaccination antibodies.

According to previous semi-official media reports, an EU expert has
been dispatched to the island to monitor and evaluate the situation.
The minister of agriculture was cited saying that the "EU official
visited the farms and warned us that if he found clinical symptoms in
the animals, then it was FMD," and that "the official later confirmed
the sheep were showing clinical symptoms". Later, the minister said
"the government was awaiting the results of an expert analysis on how
FMD arrived in Cyprus."

If such a report has indeed been written, its earliest publication --
in line with the principle of transparency -- will save further
confusion, suffering, economic losses and unfounded allegations. It
will be interesting to note if the report includes also data on tests
in bovines, both for FMD as well as for bluetongue. - Mod.AS]
