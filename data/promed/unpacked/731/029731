Health officials say they are investigating a "stomach flu" outbreak, after over 100 people are apparently ill after attending an oyster festival, in Worcester County.

The Maryland Department of Health said on Fri 10 Nov 2017 that their Division of Outbreak Investigation is working with the Worcester County Health Department to investigate a gastroenteritis outbreak that happened at a Beer and Oyster Festival in Ocean City. The festival was apparently held at Fager's Island Restaurant on 4 Nov 2017.

According to state health officials, to date, there have been 145 cases of illness reported in Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey that could be connected to the outbreak. There have been no reports of hospitalizations and deaths. Officials report that on Saturday [11 Nov 2017], the Worcester County Environmental Health staff will be onsite to check the facility and ensure that employees who are ill or who have been ill in the last 48 hours are excluded from working.

In reference to the investigation, Fager's Island General Manager Kevin Myers said: "We welcome their assistance and presence at Saturday's [11 Nov 2017] event. I assure any attendees or concerned patrons that all regulations have been and will be followed to ensure proper food safety."

Individuals who attended the event on Sat 4 Nov 2017 and who are concerned about their health should see their physicians. They are also urged complete the survey to provide officials with additional information.

To reduce the risk of transmission of gastroenteritis to others, officials advise that individuals who are ill should not prepare food or provide healthcare for others, attend school, go to work, or attend parties or gatherings for 48 hours after diarrhea and vomiting have stopped. Individuals who have been sick should continue frequent hand washing with soap and water even after that time.

[The etiology of this substantial outbreak is not clear at this point. Variables needed to know in producing a differential diagnosis here would include incubation time between the event and the onset of symptoms, whether fever was present, whether the symptoms were vomiting or diarrhea or both, and for how long the illness lasted, as well as whether the oysters were raw or cooked and what other foods were served?

ProMED would appreciate more information about the episode. Potential causes include norovirus, Salmonella, diarrhetic shellfish poisoning, and staphylococcal enterotoxin illness. - Mod.LL
