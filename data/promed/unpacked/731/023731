[1] Sierra Leone: EVD orphans

Orphans whose families were killed by EVD are becoming a tragic legacy of the deadly outbreak in [3] West African nations, say relief organizations struggling to care for the children who may themselves be infected. ...

The nonprofit Catholic organization Salesian Missions was asked to provide care for the orphans by the government of Sierra Leone, and local staff are deciding today [19 Aug 2014] on a plan of action. ... Besides immediate needs such as food, the growing number of children whose families have been decimated by EVD will likely face long-term stigma and discrimination in the future as aid groups try to reintegrate them into the community, according to UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund.

The current epidemic, the worst on record, has strained the resources of governments and aid groups seeking to help the children, Crisafulli said. "There are already 70 in need of immediate attention," Father Jorge Crisafulli said of the orphans in Sierra Leone. "The number will increase." ...

[Re: Ebola virus disease - West Africa (143): Senegal, Sierra Leone pediatric crisis Archive No. 20140829.2735183]

Status report - Critical situation regarding disintegration of pediatric care during the EVD crisis in Sierra Leone:

Under normal conditions in Sierra Leone, pediatric medical care available is substandard. There is only one tertiary-level facility in the country -- Ola During Children's Hospital (ODCH) -- which is capable of providing basic inpatient pediatric care. As the hospital normally requires significant support from expatriate pediatricians, and there are only a few national pediatricians in the whole country, the available resources were already overburdened. Baseline health statistics are dismal, with an under-5 mortality in 2012 of 140 children/1000. One year ago, in August 2013, the ODCH admitted close to 1000 children, with 600 admissions due to malaria and almost 200 due to pneumonia.

Due to the massive outbreak of EVD and lack of concrete actions to control it, the ability to care for these children has been seriously compromised. This has been evidenced by a decrease in patient numbers seeking medical care due to fear of isolation and widespread fear of health care workers acquiring Ebola virus disease when caring for infected patients, whether confirmed, suspected, or unsuspected, without appropriate protective equipment and training in its use.

The most serious event was the recent and immediate closure of ODCH on 18 Aug 2014, when 127 inpatient children were abandoned by local hospital staff. This was due to a positive EVD test result in a young child admitted to the emergency department for 2 days, with close contact to other patients, parents and staff. The impact of this event was compounded by a Ministry of Health decision to immediately order a 21-day quarantine for 6 of 8 junior doctors. Even though screening was in place, due to deception by the child's father, the identification and isolation of this child was too late.

Now that there is active transmission in Freetown, with limited/incomplete contact history, the only way to identify suspected cases of Ebola in children is based on clinical symptoms. These mimic many other common pediatric illnesses, such as malaria and typhoid. Therefore, the only acceptable way to be able to reopen ODCH is to establish a 40-bed "fever" or isolation ward, requiring rapid lab turn-around time for EVD confirmation and a significant logistic and human resource commitment, neither of which are currently accessible. In addition, the lack of good-quality personal protective equipment (PPE) and adequate PPE training both for health care providers and support staff such as cleaners, counselors, technicians, water and waste management personnel, makes a safe reopening of the children's hospital virtually impossible.

Finally, a secure waste-disposal system, capable of coping with a large volume of waste for an EVD epidemic in an overcrowded, poor, urban area must be established. As long as the ODCH remains closed, thousands of children with treatable diseases, such as malaria and pneumonia, will die at home, without receiving essential treatment they require. The implications will also be severe for services such as outpatient pediatric HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis treatment, as these patients are either afraid to come to the hospital to receive their medications, or health care staff are placed at high risk without proper PPE to allow them to safely conduct consultations. These children will never be accounted for in national EVD mortality statistics. The only possible way to re-establish any form of pediatric care in Freetown requires a substantial and immediate international clinical and logistic intervention in order to support and instill confidence among national health care workers who are still willing to contribute to maintaining basic health care services and contribute to the fight against EVD.

[I'm sure that everyone would like to see the UN, WHO and the World Bank health division address this emergency immediately.

It will take weeks to establish safe conditions for working at this hospital. Meanwhile, there are a lot of sick orphans needing treatment for non-EVD diseases.

The world should recognize the dedication of the pediatric hospital and orphanage staff putting their lives on the line while waiting for PPE supplies and a preventive vaccine to arrive from international aid. - Mod.JW
