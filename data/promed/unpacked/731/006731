The [UK government's chief vet outlined the difficult task of bringing the
Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) crisis to an end as the number of cases rose
to 177. Jim Scudamore said the "major problem" was still concentrated in a
handful of regions that had been most affected by the virus.
He said the "bulk of cases" were still known to have been spread by
movements through Longtown market in Cumbria and by a sheep dealer in
Devon. He said: "The disease situation is still such that most of these
cases are linked together either by the movement of sheep or by local
spread because of the movement of people, equipment or animals."
Today 13 more cases were confirmed, including one at a farm in Little
Wyrley, near Walsall--the first case in the West Midlands. A 9th case in
Wales has been confirmed at a farm near Welshpool. Despite the continued
crisis, some farmers are breaking movement restrictions on livestock. A
farmer in Wales was criticized by officials for taking 23 infected lambs to
an abattoir in Llanidloes that will now have to close for a week.
Some 1000 unaffected sheep already being held at the slaughterhouse will
also have to be killed and incinerated. Carwyn Jones, Welsh Rural Affairs
minister, said: "This is very much to be regretted and something I hope
will not happen again."
Nick Brown, the Agriculture Minister, said: "Mostly people are doing what
they ought to do, but there might have been lapses. It is obviously vital
people adhere to the regime." Mr. Brown insisted the outbreak was under
control, despite "second and third wave infections."
He added, "At the beginning people were saying the restrictions were very
harsh and panicked, but it is why we can say with confidence we have it
under control. What we cannot say with confidence is what is already in the
national flock and what effect this will have in prolonging the outbreak."
The minister outlined 3 main aspects of the disease to be investigated:
1) How did the infection get on to the site of the original outbreak?
2) Were the measures to contain the disease sufficient?
3) Did the current set-up of the livestock industry aid the spread of FMD?
Prime Minister Tony Blair met Mr Brown and Mr Scudamore to assess the
situation. Mr Blair's official spokesman said: "As we have said throughout,
it's going to be some time before this peaks and it's obviously going to
take time before the disease is eradicated. But we have taken the right
approach and it is a tough regime. There are still uncertainties about how
this is going to get resolved in that we still don't know how many cases
there will be in the future."
A total of 155 000 animals have now been earmarked for slaughter, of which
116 000 have already been culled. Since the crisis began almost 3 weeks
ago, 935 premises have been placed under restrictions, of which just under
half still remain in place. Investigations are ongoing at 159 farms and
other premises.
The Government dismissed fears of lorries [trucks taking carcasses of
animals slaughtered in the FMD epidemic to a rendering plant could spread
the disease to unaffected areas.
Farmers protested the transfer of carcasses over long distances from Devon
and Wales to the plant in Widnes, Cheshire. They gave a warning it could
spread the disease to areas currently unaffected and claimed they had seen
the legs of dead animals sticking out of lorries, despite assurances from
the Government only sealed lorries would be used.
But Nick Brown, the Agriculture Minister, insisted the lorries, of which
more than 30 were being used, were sealed and had been thoroughly tested.
The lorries were also sprayed with disinfectant, sheeted over with
polythene and covered over the top with tarpaulin, a process carried out
under veterinary supervision, he said. They were also disinfected again and
cleaned before leaving the rendering plant on their return journey.
Rendering has been introduced because it has proved logistically impossible
to create large pyres everywhere they are needed. Sheep are particularly
difficult to burn because their wool is fire retardant. Farmers and their
families have been distressed to have piles of animal corpses on their land
for many days after they were shot.
The rendering plant at Widnes -- a modern complex built to destroy cattle
under the bovine spongiform encephalopathy control measures -- is capable
of destroying 30 000 sheep or 10 000 cattle a week. Under the rendering
process, carcasses are burned in high-performance incinerators and reduced
to 2 main by-products: tallow and bonemeal.
Some of the tallow will be used at the Widnes plant as fuel to burn further
batches of livestock passing through the incinerators. The other waste will
either be removed to landfill sites or will be used as fuel in power
stations. Unlike BSE waste from similar plants, the FMD residue is not
deemed to pose such a high risk to the environment. That is why officials
have decided that it is safe to put it into landfill.
Before being removed from the farms where they are shot, the carcasses are
doused with disinfectant to kill any virus on their surfaces. In addition,
acids generated during the natural decomposition of the animals destroy the
virus. Care is taken not to overload the trucks because the carcasses swell
as the decomposition process gathers pace. This precaution is aimed at
preventing any carcasses toppling out of the trucks and to minimize
instances of limbs being exposed. The virus can be carried on the air.
