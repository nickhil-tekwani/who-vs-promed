Quinacrine and Chlorpromazine May Be Active against vCJD Prions
---------------------------------------------------------------
Scientists in America have given details of the drugs that have been used
to treat a young English woman thought to have variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease [abbreviated as vCJD or CJD (new var.) in ProMED-mail. The young
woman from Merseyside was given just a year to live when she was diagnosed
with suspected [variant CJD in June, but after treatment in America she
showed significant improvement. However, the US scientists said that a
second patient given the drugs showed no signs of improvement [and
treatment was discontinued.
A Department of Health spokesman said that the UK government had been in
touch with the American team and would consider funding research and
setting up a clinical trial. He added that the families of 6 other living
British sufferers of the disease would be informed of the American
treatment. But he sounded a note of caution about the drugs involved, which
are currently used to treat patients with malaria and psychosis. The drugs
are quinacrine, used to treat malaria, and chlorpromazine, which is given
to patients with schizophrenia and other psychotic conditions. Tests on
mice found that both prevented prion molecules from changing into the form
linked with vCJD, which destroys the brain. Critically, both are able to
penetrate the blood-brain barrier - a natural "wall" put up by the body to
stop toxic substances entering the brain.
The US team is led by Professor Stanley Prusiner, who won the 1997 Nobel
prize for medicine for his work on prions -- the infectious protein agents
thought to cause brain diseases such as BSE and CJD. A paper describing
this research will be published in the Proceedings of the National Academy
of Sciences.

[Later news bulletins from the BBC have emphasized caution in
interpretation of these initial reports. Nonetheless, rapid progress is
being made in this field of research. Recently Ebari, Flechsig and
Weissmann (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, Vol. 98, Issue 16, 9295-9299, July
31, 2001) reported another significant observation relevant to the
treatment of prion-related disease. Enari et al. found that exposure of
mouse scrapie-infected neuroblastoma cells to phosphatidylinositol-specific
phospholipase C or to a monoclonal anti-prion protein antibody (6H4) both
cured chronically infected cells and prevented infection of susceptible
cells. Their experiments indicated that the level of the scrapie prion in
infected cells is determined by a steady state equilibrium between
degradation and formation, and that depletion of the normal cellular form
of the prion protein can interrupt propagation of the aberrant scrapie
prion form. They suggest that passive immunisation may provide a
therapeutic approach to prion-related disease. - Mod.CP

Acridine and phenothiazine derivatives inhibit the formation of pathogenic
prion proteins and may even enhance their clearance from infected cells,
investigators at the University of California at San Francisco report in
the August 14th issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
Dr. Stanley B. Prusiner and colleagues screened drugs known to penetrate
the blood-brain barrier for their ability to inhibit pathogenic prion
formation. They used as their model cultured neuroblastoma cells
chronically infected with scrapie prions.
Chlorpromazine, promazine, and acepromazine at concentrations of 2-10
micromolar caused disappearance of the protein after 6-day treatments. The
antimalarial agent quinacrine, a structural antecedent of the
phenothiazines, was effective at doses as low as 200 nM.
What the inhibitors all had in common was a tricyclic structure with an
aliphatic side chain extending from the middle ring moiety. Furthermore,
since phenazine and phenothiazine did not act as prion inhibitors, the
tricyclic scaffold alone must not be sufficient for antiprion activity, the
researchers add.
Dr. Prusiner's team believes that quinacrine could be an immediate
candidate for the treatment of patients dying of prion diseases. Even
though less potent, the investigators posit that phenothiazines may be even
more effective than quinacrine if they cross the blood brain barrier more
efficiently. Another option would be use of the 2 types of drugs in
combination.
Dr. R. Anthony Williamson, of the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla,
California, told Reuters Health, "It's a case of using well-known drugs for
a different application." He continued, "Their research has the advantage
that it's using drugs that have already been through the Food and Drug
Administration approval mechanisms. People know the pharmacokinetics and
the toxicology of the drugs."
A spokesman for the Department of Health in London stressed that there is
currently no way of diagnosing vCJD until after death. This makes it
difficult to be certain the drug is treating the disease and not another
condition with similar symptoms.
