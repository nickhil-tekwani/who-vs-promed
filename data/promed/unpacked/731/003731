[We have also heard from a reliable source that there have been no reported
human cases to date associated with consuming this product, and that the
company involved conducted a similar consumer level recall in June 2002 on
2 of its products due to presence of Listeria. - Mods. MPP/JW]
[In the light of this information, there is probably no cause for alarm.
The products have been on sale in stores in only 2 towns in the Cairns
region of northern Queensland since 10 Jul 2002, with no associated cases
of human disease reported. According to Chin's "Control of Communicable
Diseases Manual 2000," the maximum recorded incubation period for
listeriosis is 70 days. Unless there are any reports of associated
illness, this thread is closed. - Mod.JW]
