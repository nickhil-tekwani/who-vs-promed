I am treating in Manchester (UK) a patient that developed _Mycobacterium abscessus_ disseminated skin disease following cosmetic surgery at a hospital in Iraq. She underwent the operation in September 2020. The operation consisted of liposuction from the abdomen and [autologous] fat transfer to the breasts, hands and calves. Two weeks later she developed the infection in all sites where the fat was grafted.

The patient herself has contacted the hospital and has been informed that there are 4 other cases (not including the patient I am treating) who reside in Iraq and have developed the same infection after cosmetic procedures in the same hospital. I have been in contact with the surgeon, and an infectious diseases specialist has contacted me to ask advice on treatment of one of the other cases. I asked for more details regarding how many patients have been affected by this surgical outbreak and what mitigating actions have been implemented, but unfortunately I have not had any reply yet.

The most likely stage of the surgical procedure where contamination may have occurred in our patient is at the time of extracorporeal fat filtration, following fat aspiration from the abdomen and before fat reinjection to the breasts, hands and calves. Different methods can be used in the fat filtration stage. These include centrifugation, mechanical filtering using a fine mesh, or filtration through a mesh under suction power. Depending on the system used and the level of cleaning and disinfection of the materials, autologous fat contamination with environmental organisms such as _Mycobacterium abscessus_ can occur. Contamination with different strains of rapidly growing mycobacteria and with other environmental organisms can theoretically occur in the same patient or in different patients being exposed to the same contaminated materials.

[The patient] I am treating is a] 35-year-old woman with a background of hypothyroidism and asthma. Resident in the UK, she travelled to Iraq to have the above-described procedure. Two weeks after the operation, having returned to the UK, she developed painful nodules and abscesses over her arms, legs, and breasts at the fat injection sites. She was initially treated by her GP and by plastic surgeons in Manchester with several courses of broad-spectrum antibiotics and incision and drainage of some of the abscesses with very little benefit.

She came to our attention in November 2020, and we sent further surgical samples for mycobacterial culture, which grew _Mycobacterium abscessus_. The organism was identified by whole genome sequencing analysis carried out at the National Mycobacteria Reference Service (NMRS -- Central & North) in Birmingham (UK). No mutations associated with macrolide resistance were detected. Pending the phenotypic susceptibility results, she was started on IV amikacin, oral azithromycin, oral clofazimine and IV tigecycline. She developed acute pancreatitis likely caused by tigecycline, which had to be stopped in January 2021.

Phenotypic susceptibility results became available in January 2021: clarithromycin 8 mcg/mL, borderline high; amikacin 16 mcg/mL, sensitive; tobramycin 16 mcg/mL, resistant; cefoxitin 64 mcg/mL, intermediate; imipenem 64 mcg/mL, no defined breakpoints; cotrimoxazole greater than 8/152 mcg/mL, resistant; linezolid 32 mcg/mL, resistant; ciprofloxacin greater than 4 mcg/mL, resistant; moxifloxacin greater than 8 mcg/mL, resistant; doxycycline greater than 16 mcg/mL, resistant; tigecycline 0.25 mcg/mL, no defined breakpoints.

Based on the results above, we switched the treatment regime to the following combination: oral rifabutin 300 mg once a day; oral azithromycin 500 mg once a day; oral clofazimine 100 mg once a day; IV amikacin 15 mg/kg once a day; IV Recarbrio (imipenem-relebactam) 500 mg-250 mg twice a day; IV imipenem 500 mg twice a day (as a "top up" of imipenem in addition to Recarbrio).

The patient remains on this regime to date [26 Feb 2021]. She is receiving it as OPAT [outpatient antibiotic therapy]. She is responding very well to treatment. We will treat her for 9-12 months in total, depending on how she continues to respond. After the first 3 months of induction, we will probably simplify the regimen.

I have minimal information unfortunately [on the other patients in this outbreak]. I know from the infectious diseases physician in Iraq that one of the patients was not responding well to treatment, which was suboptimal. I informed him of our identification and sensitivity results and suggested treatment options for the patient he is treating, aware that some of these options may be difficult to get ahold of locally.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Giorgio Calisti for submission of this case report.

_Mycobacteroides abscessus_ (formerly _Mycobacterium abscessus_) is a non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM), i.e., an acid-fast bacillus that is part of a grouping separate from the _M. tuberculosis_ complex (http://www.cdc.gov/hai/organisms/mycobacterium.html). NTMs differ among themselves on the basis of in vitro growth rate, colonial pigmentation, and rapid molecular diagnostics. Rapidly growing NTM species (RGM) include the _M. fortuitum_ complex and the _M. chelonae-abscessus_ group. RGMs produce mature growth on agar plates within 7 days of incubation. The _M. abscessus_ complex includes _M. abscessus_ sensu stricto, _M. massiliense_, and _M. bolletii_.

NTMs are environmental mycobacteria, found in water and soil, which can form biofilms on the inner surfaces of water distribution systems. Water from these systems can contaminate medications and medical instruments. Outbreaks of infections due to RGM are generally related to subcutaneous injection of substances contaminated with the bacterium or through invasive medical procedures using contaminated equipment or implanted devices. Infection can also occur after accidental injury when the wound is contaminated by soil. _M. abscessus_ also can cause respiratory tract infection in patients with cystic fibrosis.

Tattoo ink contaminated during the manufacturing process or when diluted with non-sterile water has been implicated in various outbreaks of tattoo-associated _M. abscessus_ infections (see ProMED post Mycobacterium abscessus - Argentina: (SF) tattooing 20190627.6540973). Water from dental unit water lines was implicated in causing several large outbreaks of _M. abscessus_ dental infections when the water was used to irrigate the dental wound (https://www.iccs-home.com/dential-infection-update-pulpotomy-procedures-and-mycobacterial-in-children and https://www.jwatch.org/na41029/2016/04/12/mycobacterium-abscessus-infection-dental-procedure).

An outbreak of abdominal wall wound infections due to the same strain of _M. abscessus_ was reported in a group of 8 US patients who had abdominal liposuction at one overseas clinic (https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/46/8/1181/360629). These patients had traveled abroad to receive their medical care, labeled as "lipotourism," as may have happened in the patient described in the case report above. Abscesses at the site of liposuction, without fever or leukocytosis, were said to characterize the infection in these patients (https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/46/8/1181/360629).

_M. abscessus_ infection at sites of autologous fat transfer for soft tissue augmentation following liposuction was reported in 12 patients at several private hospitals in China (https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/sur.2019.270). The injection procedure in all these patients was said to use a 27-gauge needle to transfer fat from donor site to recipient site after processing through gauze filtration. No definite source of contamination was implicated in these patients.

_M. abscessus_ is a notoriously multidrug-resistant organism. It is resistant to most beta-lactams, likely due to its bacterial cell wall biochemistry and to a broad-spectrum, chromosomally encoded Ambler class A beta-lactamase (BlaMab) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6167491/). Of the beta-lactam subclasses, carbapenems have the greatest activity against _M. abscessus_, and among the carbapenems, imipenem the most activity against _M. abscessus_ (https://jcm.asm.org/content/54/6/1586). Imipenem is currently recommended as part of first-line treatments for _M. abscessus_ infections. Meropenem, another carbapenem, is less active than is imipenem when used alone against _M. abscessus_. BlaMab is resistant to inhibition by the beta-lactamase inhibitors clavulanate, tazobactam and sulbactam (https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/69/3/691/784297). However, 2 newer non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitors -- relebactam (marketed with imipenem) and vaborbactam (marketed with meropenem) -- improve the activity of both these carbapenems against _M. abscessus_ (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-57844-8 and https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6395916/). Combinations of different beta-lactam subclasses, e.g., amoxicillin plus imipenem/relebactam, may be required to fully inhibit peptidoglycan biosynthesis in _M. abscessus_ (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-57844-8).

The erm(41) gene, which confers inducible macrolide resistance through methylation of ribosomal RNA, is present in the _M. abscessus_ complex group, but many strains of _M. massiliense_ have a nonfunctional erm(41) gene, and because of this, the rate of macrolide susceptibility is higher in _M. massiliense_ than in the other _M. abscessus_ complex organisms (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4550155/). Efflux pumps have also been shown to contribute to macrolide resistance in _M. abscessus_ (https://www.dovepress.com/efflux-pumps-contribute-to-intrinsic-clarithromycin-resistance-in-clin-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-IDR).

Infection with _M. abscessus_ is usually treated with a combination therapy of amikacin, tigecycline, cefoxitin, and imipenem, combined with oral clarithromycin or azithromycin, if the patient's isolate is macrolide susceptible, for one month, followed by a combination of clofazimine, linezolid, minocycline, moxifloxacin or cotrimoxazole for 12 months, depending on results of susceptibility testing. See the guidelines from the US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) and the European Cystic Fibrosis Society (ECFS) and the British Thoracic Society for specific recommendations at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4717371/ and https://thorax.bmj.com/content/72/Suppl_2/ii1.long. - Mod.ML
