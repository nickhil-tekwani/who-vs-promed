New Hampshire health officials say a mule has tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis [EEE] in Candia [Rockingham County].

The Department of Health and Human Services says that raises the risk level for people in Candia from "moderate" to "high" for getting sick from the mosquitoborne disease. Surrounding towns of Auburn, Chester, and Raymond [Rockingham County] and Hooksett [Merrimack County], will be increased from "low" to "moderate" risk.

Last month [August 2014], a Conway [Carroll County] resident contracted EEE, the 1st confirmed human case in the state in 5 years. The department says EEE can be fatal and there's not a specific treatment. Symptoms include a high fever, severe headache, stiff neck and sore throat. It can occasionally cause seizures and coma.

A total of 6 batches of mosquitoes have tested positive for EEE and none have tested positive for the West Nile virus.

Late last week [week of 25 Aug 2014], the South Carolina Veterinarian's Office verified that a horse in Colleton County had been stricken with eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), 1 of 7 cases of the almost always fatal disease in the state so far this year [2014].

Dr Adam Eichelberger, director of Animal Health Programs at Clemson University, said officials who monitor the disease only identify the county where an EEE case is reported to protect the privacy of the owner of the stricken horse. Officials of the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control [DHEC], he added, work with the state veterinarian's office to handle the individual cases. DHEC also conducts spraying in the areas where the horse had been stricken to control the mosquito population. Eichelberger said weather plays an important role in the number of EEE and West Nile cases his office will handle in the course of a year. "2003 had been the 1st time we had had significant numbers of EEE." Then there was 2013, when 49 horses in South Carolina were stricken with EEE. "We were the number one state in the country." 48 of those horses died from the disease. Colleton County had one reported EEE case in 2013.

Eichelberger points out that in the years leading up to 2013, the number of horses contracting EEE was very low. He suggests that was a contributing factor to the high number of cases in 2013. "As soon as you stop having any cases, people start forgetting about it, " he suggested. The number of cases soared in 2013 because "when we did have an ideal environment for mosquitoes, some people quit obtaining vaccinations." He also suggests because the state was experiencing a poor economy, some horse owners decided to forego the expense of the vaccinations.

Eichelberger suggests that there are a number of reasons for the decrease. South Carolina had a colder winter and a drier spring and summer than last year [2013]. He also believes that increased awareness of EEE and West Nile virus has people "doing a better job of spraying and getting vaccinations. West Nile virus and EEE are very similar," he said. Both affect the central nervous system and in both cases the vectors are mosquitoes. EEE is the more deadly to horses. 9 out of 10 horses will die from EEE. Around 4 out of 10 will die from West Nile. "We have known about EEE for years; West Nile is a newer disease."

"Vaccines are very effective for both diseases," Eichelberger said. "With vaccinations and good mosquito management you can eliminate the issue. "You typically see EEE and West Nile in the summer and early fall," he said. "Last year [2013], our 1st case was in June, this year the 1st case in August."

Eastern equine encephalitis can be prevented in horses by a vaccine, which is often combined with West Nile virus vaccine. Therefore, one injection and the animal is protected from at least 2 diseases. The vaccine needs to be given twice, 3 weeks apart, and in areas where EEE is most prevalent it is recommended to revaccinate every 4-6 months as the immunity to EEE wanes rather rapidly.

There are also mosquito sprays for horses that should be used.

People should be cautious to use mosquito repellant with DEET, wear long sleeves, and remember that dusk and dawn have the highest number of mosquitoes and should be avoided. - Mod.TG]
