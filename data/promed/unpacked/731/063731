New cases of dengue fever continue to be detected
-------------------------------------
The health care units have reported that, despite the efforts of the
health authorities, new cases of dengue fever continue to be detected
in the country. According to sources from the ministry of health,
during the past week, 518 new cases of dengue fever and 9 cases of
dengue hemorrhagic fever were reported.
The ministry's statistics indicate that, to date, 5564 suspected
cases have been recorded, of which 2243 cases of classic dengue fever
and 102 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever have been confirmed; 6
children have died, and 10 more are hospitalized in the intensive
care unit of the Benjamin Bloom Children's Hospital.
Last June, the government declared an epidemic in the capital and 3
states of the country. According to the ministry of health, 50
percent of the cases are concentrated in the municipalities of the
capital.
As part of the campaign to combat the disease, over the past 2 weeks,
half a million students trained by health promoters from the ministry
of health, have been carrying out the elimination of mosquito
breeding sites and the distribution of the larvicide Abate [temephos]
to be applied to water deposits.
El Salvador suffered one of its worst outbreaks of dengue fever in
2000, when approximately 3000 cases were confirmed and more than 25
fatalities occurred, mainly among children. During 2002, 9 children
and one adult died as a result of dengue hemorrhagic fever.

When 43-year-old Prabhat Sharan was confirmed with dengue fever he
rushed to be admitted in a nearby nursing home. To his shock, he
found that the Saki Naka nursing home turned him away because it was
already full with dengue cases. After frantic calls and a painful
drive through Andheri, Mr Sharan finally found a bed at Sanjeevani
hospital, where he was the 15th dengue fever case seen at that
hospital in the last month.
Mr Sharan's experience has highlighted the continuing spread of
dengue in the city. According to official statistics, dengue fever
has taken 7 lives in the city this year. [2003]. Mumbai has recorded
238 cases of dengue this year as against 135 suspected cases last
year [2002]. The maximum number of cases are from Malad (22), and
Borivli (20).
"We have not confirmed a single case of dengue because only 18
percent of the reported cases have undertaken the second confirmatory
test, which has to be done after 10 days," said BMC executive health
officer Dr R M Kathuria.
In Maharashtra [state] this year as many as 1398 cases of dengue
fever have been reported with a death toll of 18. "Pune has recorded
the highest dengue suspected cases with as many as 376 dengue attacks
of which 7 patients failed to respond to the medicines," Dr Salunkhe
said. Cases of dengue have been predominantly detected in Thane,
Akola, Yavatmal, Nashik, Latur, Auranagabad, Solapur, & Sangli.
However, doctors have raised doubts about the statistics. They point
out that private hospitals often don't report a dengue fever case,
that the tests are faulty and not widely available, and public
hospitals are often overcautious in confirming cases.
