On [29 Sep 2016], the National Reference Center for Rabies at the Scientific Institute of Public Health (WIV-ISP) diagnosed rabies in a bat (common serotine, _Eptesicus serotinus_) found by a hiker in the southern part of Wallonia.

The bat showed neurological signs (unable to fly) and had bitten the thumb of the hiker. Post-exposure treatment (immunoglobulins and vaccination) was initiated within one day.

The diagnosis was carried out on brain specimen by using both the direct fluorescent antigen test (FAT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Viral sequencing identified the virus as European bat lyssavirus-1b (EBLV-1b). The virus-neutralizing antibody titer was below 0.5 IU/ml as determined in a seroneutralization assay (RFFIT) in which CVS-11 was used as the challenge virus.

Belgium is free from sylvatic classic rabies since 2001 thanks to an elimination program carried out by oral vaccination of foxes. Although the circulation of lyssaviruses in bats in Belgium was suspected, it was never confirmed before.

This is the 1st indigenous case of a rabid bat detected in Belgium.

More information on this event can be found on the website of the Scientific Institute of Public Health.

[Special thanks to Drs Brochier, Terryn, Van Gucht and Rebolledo for this important contribution. Genomic characterization has further differentiated European rabies viruses of bats into a separate group, European bat lyssavirus (EBLV). Infections by European bat lyssavirus type 1 (EBLV-1) appears to be the most prevalent variant, and have been reported in bats and humans in Northern Europe. Within this group there is a further division into subtypes (genotypes) 1 and 2. Phylogenetic analysis has identified 2 lineages within the EBLV-1 genotype, supported by geographical separation. EBLV-1a is distributed over northern Europe between the Netherlands and Russia, whilst EBLV-1b is found only in Western Europe along an axis from Spain to the Netherlands. This is why it was expected to be present in Belgium. - Mod.PMB
