A week after the discovery of a case of chikungunya in the Plateau
Caillou district, 2 others have just been detected in the same sector
(Saint Paul). The epidemiological assessment yesterday [29 Mar 2010]
was raised to 3 confirmed cases and 3 other probable [cases]. The
strengthening of measures against the mosquito, in place since 18 Mar
[2010], is ongoing. It will be completed in the next [few] days, by
actions on the ground for public awareness. It is particularly
recommended to eliminate standing water in the environment (empty
saucers, gutters, respect [garbage] collection days). The people
should also protect themselves against mosquito bites by applying
repellents or wearing covering clothing.

[Interestingly, health authorities reporting the chikungunya outbreak
on Madagascar earlier in March 2010 indicated that residents in
Reunion should be concerned about the virus arriving on Reunion and
being transmitted there (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20100323.0918).
Unfortunately, their concern was well founded. The last previously
reported cases of chikungunya by Reunion Island health authorities
were in mid-August 2009 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20091103.3790).
