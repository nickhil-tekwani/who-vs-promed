African swine fever [ASF] has been confirmed in 2 wild boars in the commune of Etalle (province of Luxembourg). Coordinated actions between the various levels of power are being taken to prevent a possible spread of the virus at the level of wildlife (regions) and pig farms (federal). Belgium remains unscathed from the disease at the level of pig farms.

The Food Agency's national reference laboratory, Sciensano, and the Walloon region have held on [Thu 13 Sep 2018] an emergency meeting to identify the measures to be adopted in a coordinated way in Belgium following the confirmation of the 2 cases in wild boar. The fight against the disease is not a public-health issue but an animal- and economic-health issue.

Competencies are divided between the regional level for wildlife health and the federal level for the health of farm and domestic pigs.

ASF is native to Africa and has been present for several years in Eastern European countries, both in domestic pigs and wild boars. In recent months, it has spread more rapidly and further west, affecting countries that were previously unscathed, and many outreach communications have already been held in this regard in Belgium and Europe at the level of farmers, hunters, and the general public. The latest contaminations in Europe could be the consequence of introducing leftover food left behind by travelers from infected areas.

In Belgium, field monitoring measures have been well implemented, allowing the most recent detection of suspected cases in some dead boars. Samples were taken directly and sent to Sciensano, where it was confirmed today [Thu 13 Sep 2018]. Wildlife control and prevention measures within pig farms are now being implemented at the regional and federal levels, respectively, in a high-performance collaborative framework. Biosecurity in pig farms is essential, and the FASFC ensures that it is permanently properly insured.

The situation is being taken very seriously by the various authorities and levels of power in Belgium, and the measures are carefully being put in place and monitored, given the potential impact for the livestock and hunting sectors. A national task force was set up in early 2018 in this context. The different levels of power will continue to work closely together to maximize the effectiveness of prevention and control measures.

The long leap of ASF westwards into Belgium is apparent in OIE's interactive ASF map, which presents all reported ASF outbreaks, globally, since January 2017. The map is available at https://tinyurl.com/y93n3df9 (click on the Baltic region, then zoom in). Thus far, the most western outbreaks were recorded in northern Poland.

Notably, Belgium had suffered an earlier ASF outbreak, namely in 1985; see Mod PC's commentary in 19970219.0406:
"The outbreak of African swine fever in Belgium in 1985 showed many violations of disease-control principles. A tourist-farmer brings sausage back to Belgium from Spain and probably feeds scraps to his pigs, a veterinarian spreads the disease by using already-used syringes for injections on a different farm, and a few farmers bury their dead pigs instead of reporting them."

A paper describing the 1985 event (Ref 1) includes the following abstract:

"In March 1985, an outbreak of African swine fever was diagnosed in Belgium, in the province of West Flanders. The source of the infection was probably pork imported from Spain, which was fed to only one boar. A total of 12 farms were infected in the epizootic out of 185 farms that were in contact. Severe control measures were imposed, and the pigs on 60 farms were slaughtered (34 041 animals). In September 1985, it was concluded that African swine fever had been eradicated. This conclusion was based mainly on a serological survey of 3008 farms (116 308 blood samples), which remained negative."
