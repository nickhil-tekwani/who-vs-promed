The State Veterinary Institute in Pulawy confirmed the occurrence of the 2nd case of African swine fever (ASF) in wild boars in the Lubuskie province [voivodship], in the Nowa Sol county, informed the Chief Veterinary Officer.

"The positive result concerns the corpse of a fallen wild boar found within the contaminated zone designated by the Regulation of the Lubuskie Voivode on combating African swine fever (ASF) in pigs and wild boars in the Nowa Sol and Wschowa counties", reads the communiqu√©.

The contaminated area with a circumference of approx. 36 km [about 22 mi] is completely enclosed from 15 Nov 2019. Activities related to the fencing of the area are expected to be finished on [Mon 18 Nov 2019].

The Chief Veterinary Inspectorate informs that "intensive searches of the contaminated area and adjacent areas are underway to analyze the epizootic situation and to plan the location of the construction of a second external fence."

The president of the Lubuska Chamber of Agriculture, Stanislaw Mysliwiec, announced on [Mon 18 Nov 2019] that about 150 people took part in the search of the contaminated zone on the 1st day and found 9 dead boars in its area. On [Sun 17 Nov 2019], about 80 people were involved in the action; they discovered 11 dead boars.

On [Mon 18 Nov 2019], these activities are also being carried out with the participation of over 100 people. The area is checked by foresters, hunters, firefighters of the TSO and farmers.

"We very much hope that the event remains limited to the 2 established 10 km [6 mi] radius circuits. For now, there are no reports of dead boar outside the threatened area," added Mysliwiec.

The Chief Veterinary Officer reminds of the need to comply with the biosecurity rules by persons operating pig holdings in order to avoid the potential possibility of transferring the disease from the natural environment to the farm.

In case a corpse of a fallen boar is found, the corpse should be left at the place of discovery and the district veterinarian should be immediately informed.

[The distance from Nowa Sol county to the German border is about 70 km (43.5 mi). Wschowa county is located about 30 km (18.64 mi) eastwards to Nowa Sol, 100 km (62 mi) from the German border. For both these new cases, as well as all of Poland's earlier ASF cases in wild boars, please refer to Pig Progress interactive map at https://www.pigprogress.net/Health/Articles/2019/11/ASF-Poland-Virus-hops-300-km-closer-to-Germany-500359E.

The discovery of a 2nd infected boar in western Poland, some 70 km (about 44 mi) from the German border, is alarming news for both countries, presenting a striking, 300 km [186 mi] leap of ASF westwards, putting Poland's voluminous pork exports at risk while presenting a serious, immediate threat of its introduction into hitherto ASF-free Germany. The virus must have been circulating in the affected area for at least a week, probably longer (ASF incubation period is reported to be 4 to 19 days in naturally-acquired cases).

Results of the laboratory investigations of the 10 remaining dead boars which have been found during the weekend are expected soon.

We are grateful to Sabine Zentis for the submission of today's earlier reports on the detection of 10 dead boars during the weekend (16-17 Nov 2019). - Mod.AS
