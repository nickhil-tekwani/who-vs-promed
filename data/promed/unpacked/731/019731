The National Epidemiology Network and the Venezuelan Public Health Society announced that the cases of diphtheria in Venezuela continue to increase due to the shortage of vaccines and supplies for treatment and the failure of public policies to attack it.

Both associations urged the Ministry of Health to issue a statement and to publish the official information, since the data on the epidemic have not been updated for 8 months.

In a statement, members of the health organizations reported that the cumulative number of suspected cases of diphtheria since September 2016 is 447, of which 123 correspond to 2017.

Bolivar is one of the most affected states with 282 registered cases, equivalent to an increase of 63.08 percent, followed by Anzoategui (37 cases), Miranda (29), Monagas (26), Apure (19), Sucre (10), Capital District (9), and Zulia (8). In the other entities, 6 cases were reported in Cojedes, Vargas (5), Yaracuy (4), Merida (3), Trujillo (3), Barinas (2), Portuguesa (2), Carabobo (1), and Nueva Esparta (1), totaling 27 cases, representing 6.5 percent of the total.

It is estimated that in 2016 there were at least 40 deaths from diphtheria, more than 30 of them reported just from Bolivar state. Other fatal cases were reported from 6 regions: Monagas (3), Anzoategui (2), Bol√≠var (1), and Sucre (1). There is no information from the other 2 states, where 3 additional deaths were recorded.
