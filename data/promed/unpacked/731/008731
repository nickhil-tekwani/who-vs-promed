Hannaford, a Scarborough, Maine-based grocery chain, is recalling an
undetermined amount of fresh ground beef products that may be
contaminated with a strain of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype]
Typhimurium, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and
Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today, 15 Dec 2011.

The products subject to recall are any size package of the following:

"73 percent Hannaford Regular Ground Beef"
"75 percent Hannaford Regular Ground Beef"
"80 percent Hannaford Regular Ground Beef"
"85 percent Hannaford Regular Ground Beef"
"90 percent Hannaford Regular Ground Beef"
"80 percent Taste of Inspirations Angus Ground Beef"
"85 percent Taste of Inspirations Angus Ground Beef"
"90 percent Taste of Inspirations Angus Ground Beef"
"85 percent Nature's Place Ground Beef"
"90 percent Nature's Place Ground Beef"

This recall was initiated due to concerns about illnesses caused by an
outbreak of salmonellosis that may be associated with use and
consumption of fresh in-store ground beef prepared in and purchased at
Hannaford stores. The PFGE pattern associated with this outbreak is
reported rarely in the USA. The CDC have reported 14 ill persons with
an indistinguishable PFGE pattern, and 11 of those individuals
reported consuming ground beef. 7 individuals were hospitalized and no
deaths have been reported. 10 of the 14 case-patients reported
purchasing ground beef at Hannaford stores in Maine, New York, New
Hampshire and Vermont between 12 Oct 2011 and 20 Nov 2011. No other
product description is available at this time. As a result of on-going
epidemiologic and traceback investigations, as well as in-store
reviews, FSIS, working with the CDC and its state health partners,
determined that there is a link between the Hannaford ground beef
products and this illness outbreak. FSIS is continuing to work with
CDC, public health partners in the affected states and the company on
the investigation. FSIS will continue to provide information as it
becomes available.

The various ground beef packages bear sell-by dates of 17 Dec 2011 or
earlier and were sold at Hannaford stores throughout Maine,
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York and Vermont. FSIS and the
company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in
consumers' freezers. When available, the retail distribution list(s)
will be posted on FSIS' website at:
<www.fsis.usda.gov/FSIS_Recalls/Open_Federal_Cases/index.asp>.

The outbreak strain of _S._ Typhimurium has initially tested resistant
to multiple commonly prescribed antibiotics, including drug classes
such as beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and cephalosporins. Additional
information on drug resistance will be made public as it becomes
available.

Based on an examination of Hannaford's limited records, FSIS was
unable to determine responsible suppliers. FSIS recently identified
this problem at the retail level and is pursuing rulemaking to address
the concern. This recall is being issued as part of a continuing
investigation. FSIS has not yet been able to identify FSIS-regulated
suppliers of raw beef ground at Hannaford Stores related to the
outbreak that could be subject to recall action.
