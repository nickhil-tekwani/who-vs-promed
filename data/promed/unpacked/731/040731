New Jersey's Health Department has confirmed its 1st case of Eastern equine encephalitis in a human this summer [2019]. The department says an elderly Somerset County man was hospitalized, but has since been discharged for continued rehabilitation care.

Most people infected by the mosquito-borne illness have no apparent signs. But health officials say severe cases involving an inflammation of the brain begin with the sudden onset of headaches, high fevers, chills and vomiting. The illness may lead to disorientation, seizures or coma.

Eastern equine encephalitis has been detected in 22 mosquito samples and in 3 horses in the southern and eastern sections of New Jersey.

[There was a recent human Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) case in Massachusetts, the 1st human case that ProMED-mail has posted this year (2019), and now a 2nd case. So far this year (2019), all of the EEE New Jersey cases posted on ProMED-mail have been in horses, indicating that this has been an active EEE virus transmission season. The case above reminds us that human cases occur as well. As usual, the equine cases have occurred in the eastern states and a Midwestern state in the USA. There is a vaccine available for equine animals, and their owners are wise to have them vaccinated. There is no commercially available vaccine for humans, so avoidance of mosquito bites is the best preventive measure.

Additional information on EEE is available on the CDC website at https://www.cdc.gov/EasternEquineEncephalitis/. - Mod.TY
