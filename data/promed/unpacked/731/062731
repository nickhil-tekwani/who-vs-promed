I wish to comment on the report of anthrax-like infection due to _B.
cereus_ and the ensuing discussion.

Description of a _B. cereus_ strain with properties and pathogenicity
similar to a _B. anthracis_ strain is very interesting, and it
deserves investigation. However, concluding that if _B. anthracis_
with some particular features is not responsible for the infection
then bioterrorism is not an issue seems rather simplistic. It is to
consider bioterrorists as simplistic too, with no possibility or
intention to use other agents than the highly controlled _B.
anthracis_. This is for sure an error.

Another error is to present Mother Nature as a bioterrorist. What
defines bioterrorism is intention, and as far as we know, nature lacks
this intention. Only humans are bioterrorists. Designating nature as a
bioterrorist with infinite possibilities can only serve as an excuse
for those who do experimentations with [premeditated] dangerous
potentialities.

[It wasn't our conclusion that it was natural, not man made, but the
authors'. This, of course, does not rule out the weaponization of a
'natural' pathogen.I understand the writer's semantics about Mother
Nature not being a bioterrorist because of the lack of intent, but I
prefer to use "poetic license." - Mod.LL]

[I am reliably informed that the infection this Minnesota patient is
suffering from is of _B. anthracis_. The isolate is currently being
genotyped. I have also heard from senior veterinarians in Montana,
Wyoming and North Dakota that they have not had any anthrax outbreaks
so far this year (2011), so the outbreak in South Dakota is singular,
and it occurred after our human case; it was one animal in an
unvaccinated herd.

How this Minnesota person was exposed is still a matter of speculative
conjecture. Whether some host factors may have made this person
hypersensitive to exposure is yet to be determined, but it seems we
can rule out drugs and drums. - Mod.MHJ]
