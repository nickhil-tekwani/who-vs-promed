From a reliable source, we have been informed that the 14 Mar 2013 suspected foot and mouth disease outbreak in Rafah (see posting 20130314.1587397) has been confirmed in sera received by a specialised FMD laboratory and serotyped as FMDV-A. The diagnostic tests applied were NSP ELISA and antibody detection LPB ELISA.

[Raffah is in the south of the Gaza Strip, Palestinian Autonomous Authority (PA), close to the Egyptian border; in fact, the town is divided between the PA and Egypt. For a map, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gaza_Strip_map2.svg.

The suspected clinical signs were observed in several animals within a group of about 100 one-year-old male calves. Their origin is not clear; it has been suspected that they may have been transported from Egyptian territory.

The veterinary authorities in the Gaza Strip have demonstrated their capacity to control introduced animal epizootics during the FMD SAT-2 episode in April 2012. The virus originated in Egypt.

During 2012, 3 FMDV serotypes were circulating in Egypt: SAT-2, O, and A; surveillance details are included in a December 2012 presentation at http://www.rr-middleeast.oie.int/download/presentation/FMD%20Egypt.pdf. For genotyping results of the said 3 strains, see http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/africa/egy.htm. - Mod.AS
