Rare Liver Disease Kills 10 Afghans - Wheat Blamed
--------------------------------------------------
As many as 10 people have died in western
Afghanistan from a rare liver disease believed to
be caused by contaminated wheat, officials said
Saturday. At least 161 people were also
hospitalized with Gulran disease although
estimates were as high as 200 affected in Herat
province, on the Iranian border, said Peter
Graaff, resident representative of the U.N. World Health Organization.

A toxic weed called charmak, which grows in the
area, contains alkalines [alkaloids] that affect
the liver causing Gulran disease, which is named
after the affected district in Herat. Graaff said
the disease is not new but rare, and has killed
as many as 10 people in recent weeks.

Abdul Hakim Tamana, the director of the Herat
public health department, said 112 Gulran cases
have been recorded in the province's clinics, and
6 people died. "It has spread all over Gulran
district, including several villages," Tamana said.

It was unclear exactly how the people became ill.
The WHO is sending an epidemiologist from Geneva
to Afghanistan next week to investigate. Graaff
said charmak may have contaminated wheat grown in
the region, flour or other foods.

The Afghan Red Crescent Society received USD 14
000 to purchase new wheat to replace suspect
supplies in the district as a precautionary
measure, said Graziella Leite Piccolo, a
spokeswoman in Kabul for the International Committee of the Red Cross.

Tamana said Gulran disease has affected people in
the area over the past 40 years, and several
people died in 1999 and 2001 from it.

[This disease, Gulran, is named after the
affected district Herat in Afganistan. Caused by
a toxic weed charmak. It has occurred a number of
times in various years, always nears this
particular region in Afganistan, and always
resulting in fatalities. The toxic plant contains
pyrrolizidine alkaloids, known to cause liver failure and frequently death.

WHO confirms 'charmak' disease in Herat Province
------------------------------------------------
Confirmed cases of hepatic veno-occlusive disease
(VOD) - also known as "camel belly" or 'charmak'
disease - in Gulran District of Herat Province,
western Afghanistan, have surpassed 190, and 17
people have died so far, provincial health
officials said. Citing the result of tests at the
National Institute for Public Health in the
Netherlands, the UN World Health Organization
(WHO) said the disease was caused by exposure to
pyrrolizidine alkaloids found in 'charmak,' a
poisonous weed believed to be growing mostly in
grain fields in Gulran District, and which often
finds its way into locally produced wheat flour.

According to WHO, regular consumption of bread
contaminated by alkaloids contained in the weed
can cause rapidly filling ascites (also known as
peritoneal cavity fluid, peritoneal fluid excess,
hydroperitoneum or abdominal dropsy)
[<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascites>], severe
abdominal pain, vomiting and jaundice.

"VOD of the liver is a form of toxic liver damage
caused by pyrrolizidine alkaloids," WHO said.

The outbreak of 'charmak' disease was first
reported in November 2007. Of the 17 deaths 6
were men, 6 were women and 5 children, according
to Herat's public health department.

"Thirty eight other patients are currently under
medical testing which will determine whether or
not they have 'charmak' disease," Aziz Noorzai,
the head of Gulran hospital, told IRIN on the phone on 14 May 2008.

"No magic pill"
---------------
Until early May 2008 local health officials did
not know what medication should be given to
'charmak' patients to cure their illness. Medical
experts now say -- based on the Netherlands test
results -- that 2 grams of sodium in the daily
diet, the use of vitamin and mineral supplements,
and the extraction of unnecessary liquids from a
patient's swollen belly in serious cases, can
save lives and treat the disease, according to
Rana Graber Kakar, a WHO expert in Kabul.

"There is no magic pill for it," said Kakar,
adding that technical research and studies were
under way to illuminate characteristics of the
disease and help the Ministry of Public Health
(MoPH) to overcome similar challenges in future.
Rest is also recommended for long-term recovery, she said.

Food aid distributed
--------------------
In an effort to curb the outbreak, the MoPH has
launched a public awareness campaign in Gulran
District through which people are encouraged to
stop consuming locally produced flour. But the
drive has been received coldly by most of Gulran's poor populace.

"When we tell them not to eat Gulran flour, they
ask what they should eat instead," said Noorzai.

The UN World Food Programme (WFP) said it had
distributed 700 tones of mixed food items to
about 55 000 people in Gulran under food-for-work
and education incentive schemes, and a further
860 tonnes would be distributed to 24 000 people in the near future.

An Italian Provincial Reconstruction Team has
also delivered food and non-food relief items to
vulnerable families, the NATO-led International
Security Assistance Force said in a statement on 28 April.

Improved wheat cultivation needed
---------------------------------
'Charmak' has appeared at least 3 times in the
past 50 years -- always in Herat Province -- and
had affected hundreds of people each time,
according to local officials. Health experts said
the disease cannot be prevented through medical
measures only, but that improvements in wheat
cultivation, harvesting, threshing and milling --
and enabling farmers to eliminate poisonous weeds
in their fields -- would help avert future outbreaks.

"In the long-term, the government needs to focus
on agricultural policies that will reduce
contamination of grain with Heliotropium
['charmac'] weeds," the WHO said in a weekly
epidemiological monitor on 11 May 2008.

[It would seem that a method of controlling weeds
in the wheat or of sorting out the weed seed at
harvest is needed. Treating liver failure caused by this toxin is difficult.

Evidence of toxicity may not become apparent
until sometime after the alkaloid is ingested.
The acute illness has been compared to the
Budd-Chiari syndrome (thrombosis of hepatic
veins, leading to liver enlargement, portal
hypertension, and ascites). Early clinical signs
include nausea and acute upper gastric pain,
acute abdominal distension with prominent dilated
veins on the abdominal wall, fever, and
biochemical evidence of liver disfunction. Fever
and jaundice may be present. In some cases the
lungs are affected; pulmonary edema and pleural
effusions have been observed. Lung damage may be
prominent and has been fatal. Chronic illness
from ingestion of small amounts of the alkaloids
over a long period proceeds through fibrosis of
the liver to cirrhosis, which is
indistinguishable from cirrhosis of other etiology.

The pyrrolizidine alkaloids can be isolated from
the suspect commodity by any of several standard
alkaloid extraction procedures. The toxins are
identified by thin layer chromatography. The
pyrrolizidine ring is first oxidized to a pyrrole
followed by spraying with Ehrlich reagent, which
gives a characteristic purple spot. Gas-liquid
chromatographic and mass spectral methods also
are available for identifying the alkaloids.
