For the first time ever, Senecavirus A (SVA) has been detected in feed ingredients imported from an endemically infected country potentially linked to cases of SVA in pigs from a historically negative national herd.

"This is one of the biggest pieces of news the pork industry has had in regard to disease control in many years," says Scott Dee, director of research for Pipestone Applied Research and co-author of a paper published in Transboundary and Emerging Diseases about this real-world proof linking virus transmission in feed to an outbreak of disease in swine.

Although a great amount of laboratory work has proven over and over again viruses, including SVA, can survive well in feed, researchers have never had a real-world case where they could come to a strong conclusion a new virus entered a country through feed imports, Dee explains.

"This is a wake-up call big time," Dee says. "It turned out to be SVA -- which isn't that hard to deal with -- but it easily could have been foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) or African swine fever (ASF). This country got lucky it was 'only' SVA and not one of the real bad boys."

SVA is a single-stranded, non-enveloped RNA virus within the same virus family as FMD. It can cause vesicular lesions in pigs visibly indistinguishable to those caused by FMD virus. One of the big differences between SVA and FMD is once a differential diagnosis of SVA has been confirmed, the presence of SVA in pig populations does not prohibit the sale or export of pork meat and pork products.

About a month ago, Dee was contacted out of the blue by a country requesting a virtual seminar on the risk of virus introduction through feed. After presenting a 2-hour seminar, he was asked a day later to speak to the country's government.

"Well, it was intriguing," Dee says. "They wanted the same seminar, but to a very different audience, more regulatory in nature."

Another day passed and he was contacted about an outbreak of SVA in this country. The pork production company suspected imported soybean meal and other ingredients from endemically infected countries having SVA historically.

The company had imported 40 000 tons of soy from multiple countries, and it was combined in a big pile in their warehouse, Dee explains. They were feeding it and using it in multiple farms. Meanwhile, multiple farms were breaking with vesicular lesions -- SVA.

"They were getting suspicious perhaps the feed importation had brought the virus, not just to their farms, but to their country because this country had never had SVA," Dee says. "They were a historically negative national herd until now."

The pork production company performed a diagnostic investigation and discovered SVA virus in the soy. Dee says they were feeding this soy at the time the pigs broke -- a real-world bioassay.

While performing dust and core sampling of the 155 tons of soy left from the original 40 000 tons, they found the virus in the remaining amount. The fact it happened in real time made it even more authentic, Dee says.

Their conclusion was the imported soybean was the vehicle moving the virus in the country. They also determined the virus was live as well.

"Once I learned this, I thought we have to write this up. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity," Dee says. "This never happens, where you're at the right moment at the right time, where you can actually almost get a smoking gun result. All the vets in the country, as well as our team, were convinced of the facts of how the virus got in. It was live, it was getting fed to pigs and it was causing disease."

For Dee, this validated the lab work many had done over the past 8 years. He also hopes it serves as a wake-up call to everybody in the pork industry around the world that this is not just a laboratory phenomenon. It's a real-world risk factor, he says.

At first, the country's government was averse to publishing this case, Dee says. They were worried they would lose trade opportunity even though SVA is not a trade-limiting disease. Dee then got approval from the country and pork production company to write up the case with their data but not share where the outbreak occurred. The editor-in-chief of Transboundary and Emerging Diseases agreed to this approach.

"The company got to review it, and they checked off on it. Our team did the same. Hopefully full disclosure will take place later -- which is actually the goal of the pork production company," Dee adds.

"Currently they're working towards the elimination of SVA and it's going well. Everything's calming down and people aren't as nervous as they used to be." Ultimately, Dee says it doesn't matter where it happened -- it's the fact that it happened.

There are 3 reasons why this case is important for US pork producers to think about, Dee says.

1. It validates all of the virus transmission in feed research. "This shows all the lab work for the last 8 years has not been for naught," he says.

2. It's a wake-up call for the United States. "Right now the United States is doing very little about this risk factor of feed importation because we're still importing feed ingredients from countries which are very high risk. We don't have a lot of federal support, so the industry is having to do it themselves. If you're doing something about this for your company or your farm, good for you because this is a real important risk factor," Dee says.

3. It's an opportunity for the global pork industry to learn without long-term damage. "This country is extremely lucky this was not FMD or ASF -- it easily could have been. We're fortunate to have this type of a lesson without any real long-term damage to the global industry," he adds.

This real-world case also supports the US Swine Health Improvement Plan (US SHIP) feed biosecurity standard, he says. Dee encourages producers to enroll in US SHIP, participate and try to help the initiative succeed.

"These results should raise awareness throughout global agriculture that feed ingredients can serve as vehicles for the transboundary movement of viral pathogens and support the adoption of Responsible Imports practices to manage this risk," Dee wrote in the journal article. "Fortunately, this was SVA, and not FMD; however, it might not be the case next time."

[Transboundary disease transmission and/or relocation of a disease through feed and other commodities has long been a concern of a variety of individuals and laboratories. This type of situation is why those focusing on transboundary diseases (formerly called foreign animal diseases) are always working on testing and examining the "what if" scenarios.

When unusual circumstances occur, it is important to examine the "usual suspects" of diseases, but it is always necessary to keep the "out of the ordinary" diseases and situations on the tabletop and within the discussion realm until proven otherwise. The challenge for the entities working on the odd possibilities is getting funding to prove their ideas and for tests and then to educate others.

Clearly a shout out is due to Dr. Dee and his teams at Transboundary and Emerging Diseases. - Mod.TG]
