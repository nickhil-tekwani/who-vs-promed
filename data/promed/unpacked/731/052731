Argentina: Teenager Dies as a Consequence of Hantavirus Infection
-----------------------------------------------------------------
A 14-year-old boy died from hantavirus infection in a hospital in the
Argentine city of La Plata, and more than 40 people have contracted hantavirus
in the area where the teenager apparently became infected. Health authorities
in Buenos Aires Province have instituted a series of measures to prevent
additional cases.
The boy, who lived in the town of Florencio Varela, was hospitalized
last Wednesday [15 Feb 2006] in La Plata after coming down with a
fever and experiencing difficulty breathing, the Health Ministry of
Buenos Aires province stated. The teenager, who had gone camping
several weeks ago in a rural area near Florencio Varela, underwent
extensive therapy and was placed on a respirator, but doctors were
unable to save his life.
The Health authorities are investigating the teenager's death and informing
the public in an effort to prevent further cases of [hantavirus infection,
which usually manifests as hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in the Americas].
Hantaviruses are transmitted by long-tailed mice (_Oligoryzomys
longicaudatus_), which are found throughout the countryside. The symptoms of
hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) are 1st exhibited about one to 3 weeks
after exposure to [excreta of] infected mice. HPS is characterized by fever,
chills and muscle aches, followed by the abrupt onset of respiratory distress
and shortness of breath. Muscle aches are severe, involving the thighs, hips,
back and sometimes the shoulders. Other symptoms include nausea, vomiting and
abdominal pain.
Infected mice secrete the virus in their urine, saliva and droppings. A person
may be exposed to hantavirus by breathing dust after cleaning rodent droppings
or disturbing nests, or by living or working in rodent-infested settings.

[The municipality of Florencio Varela, a city of around 250 000
inhabitants, is located at 34o 50' S, 58o 40' E in Buenos Aires
Province, to the southeast of Greater Buenos Aires.
In South and Central America, several phylogenetically distinct
hantaviruses have been identified as causing HPS: these include Andes
virus in Argentina and Chile; Andes-like viruses, including Oran,
Lechiguanas, and Hu39694, in Argentina; Laguna Negra virus in Bolivia
and Paraguay; Bermejo virus in Argentina; Juquitiba virus in Brazil;
and Choclo virus in Panama. Numerous other hantaviruses have been
identified but have not been linked to human disease.
The precise identify of the hantavirus responsible for the death of
the teenager is not stated, but it is likely that it was carried by a
sigmodontine rodent; for example, Andes virus is carried by the
long-tailed mouse (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_) and Lechiguanas
virus by _Oligoryzomys flavescens_.
A comprehensive and up-to-date account of hantaviruses and HPS in
Argentina and elsewhere is available in the form of a set of 43
PowerPoint slides entitled "All about hantaviruses," prepared by the
Special Pathogens Branch of the US CDC and accessible at
