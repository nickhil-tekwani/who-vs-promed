Brief commentary about dengue 4 virus recently detected in Panama:
---------------------------------------------------------------
During the first weeks of November 1998 dengue 4 virus was isolated
from two male patients, 16 and 31 years of age. Both live in San
Miguelito, a region near Panama City, Republic of Panama.
This is the third time the endemic circulation of a new dengue
serotype has been detected in this Health Region, so that measures
must be proactive with regard to surveillance for dengue.
>From July 1994 until the end of 1998, the prevalent dengue virus
serotype has been dengue 1 virus, even though once in a while dengue
2, dengue 3 and dengue 4 viruses (October 1994) have been isolated;
14 isolates of dengue 3 virus were obtained in September 1995.
Even though there has been no association of dengue 1 and dengue 4
viruses with dengue hemorrhagic fever, there is evidence [of such an
association] in 1984 in Colombia, the Dominican Republic, and
Trinidad & Tobago.
Endemic circulation of dengue viruses in Panama has been occurring
since 1993, 50 years after the last epidemic of dengue and five years
after the reinfestation of the vector mosquito _Aedes aegypti_, when
we detected 14 cases caused by dengue 2 virus in this Health region.
