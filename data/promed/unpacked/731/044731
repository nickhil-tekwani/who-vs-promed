Subject: Heartworm, cats and Ae. albopictus
I apologize for getting into this discussion so late, I've been out of town
and have not checked my E-mail since Sat. Both Rick Duhrkopf's original
question and Nora Comiskey's answer regarding Ae. albopictus, heartworm and
cats were posted to Mosquito-l last week, I responded on Friday with the
following posting:
*******
In response to both Rick Duhrkopf's original question and Nora Comiskey's
answer I have a few comments and observations:
First, with regard to Rick's question about the prevalence of D. immitis in
cats; if there has been an increase in prevalence in cats it is probably not
because of the introduction of Ae. albopictus but because the prevalence of
the parasite in general is increasing. (This in spite of the fact that
excellent prophylactic treatment is available) In the 50's and 60's this
parasite was rare outside of the southern US, it can now be found in all 50
states.
In addition, cats are more likely to suffer from disease with a lower
parasite burden than are dogs (infection with a few adult worms may kill a
cat, dogs can withstand a much heavier parasite burden with relatively few
ill effects). So, cat infections may be more noticeable to pet owners (and
to vets).
As far as feeding on cats is concerned, I would say that cats are not any
more likely to be bitten by Ae. albopictus than any other animal; Ae.
albopictus has extremely catholic tastes and will feed on whatever is
available. However, where Ae. albo populations are high near human
habitations cats and dogs will provide a significant number of blood meals.
Furthermore, since Ae. albo populations are focalized at good breeding sites
like tire piles the probability of transmission from an infected dog to a
nearby dog at such a site will be greatly increased.
In response to Nora's information on Ae. albopictus, I agree with most of
what she has said with a few additions and qualifications. Based on my
research I would say that Ae. albopictus is a vector of D. immitis in areas
where the local population is susceptible. I have tested strains from 10
different regions of the country (USA) where Ae. albo has become established
and I have tested strains from 7 different areas of the city of New Orleans.
I have found that strains vary in susceptibility form near zero (strains
from Vero Beach, Florida and Potosi MO to as high as 70% (New Orleans) and
everything in between.
If you (or your pet) have the bad fortune to live near a susceptible
population, there will be transmission.
Both Nora and I have collected infected Ae. albo in New Orleans (see below
for the references). If one reviews the literature you will see that
mosquitoes have been considered vectors in various studies when the
infection rates were as low as 0.02%. In my dissections 1/500 were infected
(0.2%) (I don't recall the infection rate in Nora's study). My dissection
technique detects only infective stage larvae so my 0.2% rate accurately
reflects the survival of the infected mosquito long enough to transmit.
I'll bet that a dog housed outdoors near a tire pile easily gets 500 bits a
day (that's one infective bite per day!).
Furthermore, I have done a transmission trial and shown Ae. albo to be able
to transmit to a dog. I used a new Orleans strain of Ae. albo and
transmitted from an infected to an uninfected dog. Transmission has actually
been demonstrated for only 10 species of mosquito, Ae. albopictus is the
11th. This study is unpublished but I hope to have it out in the next year
or so.
The rate of heartworm infection in New Orleans is already so high (any dog
not on prophylaxis will become infected) that the addition of another
mosquito vector to the mix will not be evident in increased infection rates.
I don't have my data at my fingertips but many of the other species I have
tested (Ae. vexans, Ae. trivittatus, Ae. triseriatus) produce many more
infective larvae than do Ae. albopictus, so a dog (or cat) would probably
have to get more bites from Ae. albopictus to have an equal probability of
transmission. If there is interest I will look up the numbers.
I hope this information is of interest, If there are any more questions
please don't hesitate to ask.
