[Bats are the source of most human rabies deaths in the Americas. Bat rabies has also recently emerged as a public health threat in Australia and Western Europe http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs099/en/.

Rabies of herbivores transmitted by the common vampire bat (_Desmodus rotundus_) is called paralytic rabies. The disease mainly attacks bovines and equines, causing serious economic losses (Acha, 1968) (http://www.oie.int/doc/ged/D8348.PDF).

Pictures of the common vampire bat (_Desmodus rotundus_) can be seen at http://www.arkive.org/common-vampire-bat/desmodus-rotundus/photos.html

"Rabies has the highest case fatality of any infectious disease. When a person is exposed to an animal suspected of having rabies, the risk of rabies virus transmission should be evaluated carefully. Risk assessment should include consideration of the species of animal involved, the prevalence of rabies in the area, whether exposure sufficient to transmit rabies virus occurred, and the current status of the animal and its availability for diagnostic testing. Wild carnivores and bats present a considerable risk where the disease is found, regardless of whether abnormal behavior has been observed. Insectivorous bats, though small, can inflict wounds with their teeth and should never be caught or handled with bare hands. Bat bites may be ignored or go unnoticed, so direct contact with bats could be considered a risk of virus exposure. Any wild carnivore or bat suspected of exposing a person to rabies should be considered rabid unless proved otherwise by laboratory diagnosis; ideally, this includes bats in direct contact with people, such as those found in rooms with sleeping or otherwise unaware persons. Wildlife, including wolf hybrids, should never be kept as pets; if one of those animals exposes a person or domestic animal, the wild animal should be managed like free-ranging wildlife." (http://www.merckmanuals.com/vet/nervous_system/rabies/overview_of_rabies.html)

In February 2015, Honduras also reported a rabies's outbreak in cattle. The outbreak was located in the Province of Lempira. See event report at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=17116.

Usually with an event such as this, both the Public Health and Animal Health authorities would work together to coordinate their efforts. It is of note that, for this and the previous outbreaks in February, there is no mention of the health measures taken (if any) for those persons (field workers, laboratory staff, and official veterinarians) exposed to the affected animals, as well as any actions to vaccinate pets (dogs and cats) in the surrounding area. - Mod.CRD
