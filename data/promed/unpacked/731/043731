San Diego County [California] issued the following news: "We are seeing a level of pertussis activity that should cause concern for parents and caregivers," said Wilma Wooten, MD, MPH, County public health officer. There were 10 new cases reported this week [week of 21 Apr 2014] in which others may have been exposed, bringing the total number of cases to 266 reported so far in 2014. There were 51 cases reported by this date in 2013 and a total of 430 that year [2014]. A high of 1179 cases was reported in 2010.

"We are seeing a level of pertussis activity that should cause concern for parents and caregivers," said Wilma Wooten, MD, MPH, County public health officer. "We want everyone to receive the recommended vaccines so that they are protecting themselves as well as everyone around them."

A typical case of pertussis starts with a cough and runny nose for one to 2 weeks, followed by weeks to months of rapid coughing fits that sometimes end with a whooping sound (http://www.whoopingcough.net/sound%20of%20whooping%20cough%20with%20much%20whooping.htm). Fever, if present, is usually mild. Antibiotics can lessen the severity of symptoms and prevent the spread of disease to others.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the following vaccination schedule:
- young children need 5 doses of DTaP [diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine] by kindergarten: at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 15 to 18 months, and 4 to 6 years.
- all students entering 7th grade need proof of a whooping cough booster immunization (Tdap).
- a Tdap booster is recommended for pregnant women during their third trimester of each pregnancy, even if they got a booster before becoming pregnant.
- one dose of Tdap is recommended for adults 19 years of age and older who did not get Tdap as an adolescent.

[In San Diego County] parents can obtain the DTaP vaccine series and the Tdap booster shot for themselves and their children through their primary care physicians. Local retail pharmacies offer vaccinations for a fee, and anyone who is not covered by a medical insurance plan can get the shot from a County Public Health Center at minimal or no cost (http://www.sdcounty.ca.gov/hhsa/programs/phs/immunization_branch/immunizations_free_for_children_under_age_two.html).

[Pertussis has been on the increase throughout most of the world. This has been attributed in part to increased virulence and other genetic changes in the circulating clones of _Bordetella pertussis_, as well as waning or an ineffective immune response after vaccination. For a discussion of these problems, see moderator LL's comments in prior ProMED-mail posts on pertussis and moderator ML's comments in ProMED-mail post Pertussis - North America (02): USA (MT, CA) increased incidence 20140424.2426383. - Mod.ML
