A 7th horse at Parx Racing [Pennsylvania] tested positive for the equine herpesvirus on Monday [25 Apr 2016] and was scheduled to be moved to the track's isolation area Tuesday morning [26 Apr 2016].

There are currently 2 horses on the stable grounds who have tested positive for the herpesvirus. Both are trained by [the same trainer], who is stabled in Barn 30 along with [another trainer]. The 6th horse, who tested positive last Thursday [21 Apr 2016], is still at the track and also will be sent to the isolation area.

The isolation area was constructed at Parx over the weekend. It is a large tent that houses temporary stalls.

All 7 horses to test positive for the virus have been based with [one of the 2 trainers mentioned above]. One of the horses was claimed by [a 3rd trainer], who is stabled in Barn 4 along with [another trainer], just prior to the 1st horse becoming ill with the virus.

Barn 30 and Barn 4 are both under a quarantine. The horses housed in those barns have not been allowed to train or race since [1 Apr 2016].

All of the horses in the quarantined barns are scheduled to be tested for the virus in the near future.

During the quarantine, horses stabled at Parx are not allowed to leave track property. Horses are not allowed to ship in, either.

[Another horse positive with this virus will extend the quarantine time. This is hard on healthy horses who cannot train, but it is safer for them as the stress of training could make them break with the disease. Rest is extremely critical for these animals. - Mod.TG
