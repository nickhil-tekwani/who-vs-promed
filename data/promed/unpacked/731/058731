Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza In South Africa
-----------------------------------------------
Follow-up report No. 1
Information received on 6 Jul 2006 from Dr. Botlhe Modisane, Senior
Manager of Animal Health, National Department of Agriculture,
Pretoria:
End of previous report period: 3 Jul 2006 (see Disease Information,
19 [27], 511, dated 6 Jul 2006).
End of this report period: 6 Jul 2006.
Identification of agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5N2.
Date of start of the event: 19 Jun 2006.
Details of new outbreak: A new seropositive farm has been identified
in the Western Cape on a farm in Sandfontein, Riversdale (lower
administrative division 34o 02' 06" S; 21o 38' 31.9" E; see map at
<http://www.weather-forecast.com/locations/Riversdale.shtml>)
on 19 Jun 2006.
Only one additional seropositive farm (with 2 seropositive
epidemiological groups) situated immediately adjacent to the index
farm was detected in the 10-km-radius zone. This finding indicates
that all these 3 epidemiological units (index farm and 2
epidemiological units on the adjacent farm) have been exposed to the
same risk factors, probably related to clustering of wild birds at
the nearby river confluence rather than being indicative of aerial
spread.
Other details/comments: Sequencing of the outbreak virus at the
Onderstepoort Reference Laboratory for avian influenza indicated the
presence of an H5N2 virus not identical to the H5N2 ostrich isolate
of 2004 from the Eastern Cape, eradicated successfully at that time.
Thus, the virus described in the OIE immediate notification report
dated 3 Jul 2006 is a new strain of H5N2 that is not identical to
that found in 2004. This implies that it is a completely new
infection and that no chronic carrier situation exists in ostriches
for this virus in South Africa.

[Previous reports -- see Avian influenza, ostriches - South Africa,
H5N2 (02) 20060706.1856 -- hinted that the H5N2 in these cases may
have been the same strain as the 2004 outbreak. However, this
official report indicates that sequencing evidence suggests that this
year's [2006] strain is different. The question, as always answered
by research and with difficulty, is where did this strain come from
and was the epidemiology of the outbreak the same, both now and in
2004, and was it definitely related to wild birds? - Mod.PC]
[There are 3 Sandfonteins in South Africa but Riversdale, the lower
administrative division is in the Western Cape. The longitude and
latitude locate the outbreak in the Western Cape, so that is also the
map reference used. - Mod.PC/ARN]
