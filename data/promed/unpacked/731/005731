Combination vaccine approved to protect adolescents against whooping cough
---------------------------------------------------
The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) today, 3 May 2005,
approved the 1st combination vaccine that provides a booster immunization
against pertussis (whooping cough) in combination with tetanus and
diphtheria for adolescents. The vaccine will be marketed as Boostrix by
GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) in Philadelphia, PA.
Pertussis is a highly communicable disease of the respiratory tract that
can be especially serious for infants under 1 year old, and may even be
fatal. Pertussis can cause spells of coughing and choking that make
breathing difficult. The disease is generally less severe in adolescents,
but it is thought that they might transmit the disease to susceptible
infants and other family members. In the last 20 years, rates of pertussis
infection have been increasing in very young infants who have not received
all their immunizations and in adolescents and adults.
Boostrix is a tetanus toxoid (T), reduced diphtheria toxoid (d) and
acellular pertussis vaccine (ap), adsorbed. Although booster vaccines for
adolescents containing T and d are currently licensed and marketed for use
in this age group, none contains a pertussis component. Boostrix has the
same components as Infanrix, a DTaP vaccine for infants and young children,
but in reduced quantities. Boostrix is indicated for use as a single
booster dose to adolescents 10-18 years of age.
The efficacy of the vaccine was measured by looking at the immune response
to the vaccine, as measured by antibody concentrations. The response to the
T and d components was at least as good as the response to a licensed Td
vaccine. Boostrix also induced an antibody response to the pertussis
component of the vaccine. The response to the pertussis component was
compared to the response induced by a 3-dose series of Infanrix given to
infants in a previous study. The response of adolescents to Boostrix was
considered adequate. It is not known how long immunity to pertussis will
last. Adolescents who received Boostrix experienced pain, redness, and
swelling at the injection site. The frequency of redness and swelling after
Boostrix was similar to what is expected following the administration of a
Td vaccine. However, pain reactions at the injection site were more
frequent with those who received Boostrix. Other side effects included
headaches, fever and fatigue for a short period of time after the injection.

Whooping cough cases increasing
-------------------------------
There have been 58 confirmed cases of whooping cough in Travis County
schools in 2005. 100 more are suspected. "In 2004, we had 300 cases
reported in to us in the whole year, and we've already had more than 50
percent of that number reported to us, just in the last 6 weeks," Dr Adolfo
Valadez, of the Travis County Health Department, said.
Whooping cough looks like a regular cold or influenza in the beginning, but
gradually gets worse, becoming especially dangerous for children with
asthma. The coughing can become so severe it can close off [airways],
especially tiny ones. But doctors say those shots wear off when kids get a
little older. The greatest danger is when school-age kids catch what looks
like a cold and bring it home to their baby brother or sister. "When you
see that adolescent or adult with a cough history, test for pertussis
because we can treat it," Valadez said.
A 6 week old baby died in 2003 from whooping cough.

Area whooping cough numbers climb
----------------------------------
It's been determined to be an outbreak, with 17 confirmed cases of whooping
cough in Lee County since mid-April 2005. Of the 17 cases, 16 are in the
Central Lee Community School District.
Central Lee superintendent Chuck Reighard said the school has responded to
the outbreak by determining who had close contact with the infected student
and then making contact with the families of those who may have been
exposed to urge seeking treatment with the family doctor. Reighard said
that now that the Lee County Health Department has become involved, the
school will determine close contacts, and the health department will take
on the role of contacting families.
Reighard said the majority of the 16 cases at Central Lee are among
students in the middle school, although he said there have been a few at
the elementary and high school levels.
This isn't the 1st time that whooping cough has hit the area. This past
winter, 2004-2005, several confirmed cases were reported among students in
the Fort Madison Community School District. Lee County Health Department
Executive Director Julie Schilling said the department had 31 confirmed
cases of whooping cough from Nov 2004 through Jan 2005, with the majority
of those cases in the Fort Madison Public School system.
A release of information concerning the outbreak from the Lee County Health
Department did not indicate that there were incidents of whooping cough in
Fort Madison this time. Schilling said whooping cough has been in Iowa
since last summer [2004] but usually shows up in the fall. "But it can
occur at any time," Schilling said.

[Although ProMED-mail does not cover pertussis regularly, regular outbreaks
of the disease have continued to occur in the USA and elsewhere despite
aggressive universal childhood immunization programs. The development of a
pertussis vaccine consisting of pertussis toxoids as opposed to the older
vaccine -- which was a killed, whole-cell product -- has improved tolerance
but not immunogenicity. This product, DTaP, has been used in the pediatric
vaccination sequence for some time. As noted above, the Tdap variation is
now approved in adolescents and contains lower amounts of both diphtheria
and pertussis components than the pediatric vaccine. Vaccination in
adolescence should prolong immunity, but an additional booster will
probably be needed later in life. - Mod.LL]
