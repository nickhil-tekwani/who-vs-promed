An update on the recent Bat Lyssavirus [a.k.a. Ballina virus - Mod.CHC death
in Australia. IFT [immunofluorescence testing staining of postmortem samples
confirmed the earlier PCR-based antemortem diagnosis. Serum taken two days
before death showed no significant antibody rise when tested with a commercial
anti-rabies EIA [enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test.

[Thanks to Greg for this bulletin. Is there not yet an EIA for antibody to
Ballina virus, or is the Australian scientific community now willing to call
this rabies virus? Perhaps not IFT or IgG EIA, but other serologic methods
(neutralization, IgM EIA) might be useful in distinguishing infections caused
by rabies and Ballina viruses. We also look forward to hearing when there are
results of PCR assays of archived specimens, now being tested. - Mod CHC
