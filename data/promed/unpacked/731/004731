The Virginia Department of Health is not aware of the freshwater Drum fish
kill. We do not have a Parkersburg in Virginia and our Vienna is not on a
river. There is, however, both a Parkersburg and a Vienna in Wood County,
*West Virginia* [another US state. Since _Pfiesteria_ spp. is not known to
occur in fresh water, we have not been concerned about the fish kill from a
public health perspective.

[A visit with Scott Morrison, a Fisheries Biologist for the *West Virginia*
Natural Resources, indicated there was a freshwater Drum fish kill
consisting of approximately 3000 Drum fish. Samples of fish were sent to the
National Fish Health Laboratory in Kearneysville, West Virginia. The
laboratory has ruled out bacteria as the cause, but has not ruled out
viruses or toxins. The investigation as to the reason for the Drum fish kill
is still ongoing. Further, it was indicated that the dead Drum fish were
greater than 6 inches (15.24 cm) in length. Presently, it is not believed to
be _Pfiesteria_ and there does not seem to be a public health concern. My
apologies to the state of Virginia & my grateful appreciation for S.
Jenkins for setting me on the correct path - Mod.TG
