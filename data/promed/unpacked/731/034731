Rabies alert is issued after bats get disease
----------------------------------------------
St. Louis County is under a state-issued rabies alert, meaning that
veterinarians and physicians should be on the lookout for the disease.

The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services issued the
alert last week after receiving positive rabies test results for 11
bats in the county so far in 2004. Most bats do not carry the rabies
virus, but 5.7 percent of bats submitted from St. Louis County tested
positive this year [2004], compared to a 3.1 percent average for the
past 5 years.

The state issues a rabies alert if the disease turns up in a domestic
animal or in a significant number of wild animals.

State Public Health Veterinarian Dr. Howard Pue urged pet owners to
have dogs and cats vaccinated and to avoid letting pets roam outdoors.

People who have been bitten by an infected animal can be treated with
post-exposure prophylaxis. Nationwide, 1 or 2 people die of rabies
each year. The last reported human rabies death in Missouri was in
1959.

[Bats are often carriers of this disease and may be the source of
exposure to people. Bats can get into homes and in a defensive mode,
bite people. The public health authorities should be called to remove
a bat that has entered a home. - Mod.TG]
