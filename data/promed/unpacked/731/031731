The Philippine Department of Health (DOH) today [17 Oct 2007] warned
the public against diseases that may come with the rainy season.

The rainy months bring in a plethora of diseases that are,
fortunately, preventable. The most common of this band of illnesses
is dengue, which is already downing people since the early part of
the year, making it a disease to watch out for not only during this
wet season but also during summer and other dry months as well,
Health Secretary Francisco T. Duque III said.

The Philippines National Epidemiology Center (NEC) of the DOH has
already reported 12 734 dengue cases with 130 deaths nationwide since
January 2007 up to 28 Jul 2007. This figure, however, is 1.5 percent
lower compared to the same last year [2006], which listed 12 932 cases.

To win the battle against dengue, Duque advised the public to
continue following the 4-S campaign of the DOH, which is to search
and destroy possible breeding grounds of dengue-carrying mosquitoes
like old tires, broken vases and bottle caps; wear long sleeve shirts
and pants for self-protection; seek health professionals for fever 2
days or more; and saying no to indiscriminate fogging.

Cases of dengue fever continue to rise in Region VI, records at the
Department of Health show. But health authorities ruled out the
incidence of an outbreak, although an employee of the Regional
Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit (Resu) said that the region has
the highest number of dengue cases in the country.

At the latest count by the Resu, there are already 5064 dengue cases
in Western Visayas as of 30 Sep [2007]. There are 63 deaths, up
3-fold from last year's 12.

Figures for the month of October 2007 have yet to be entered in the
Resu's record.

"As compared to the same period last year [2006], there is an
increase of 318 percent in the admissions," the Resu report states, a
copy of which was obtained by The NewsToday. However, the figures
show a downward trend in the new cases.

"There is a downward trend in the number (of) dengue cases starting
from the 34th morbidity week (from 19-25 Aug [2007])," said the report.

At the same time, the Resu noted that "there are no clustering of
cases or outbreaks within the region." Within Western Visayas, the
provinces of Negros Occidental and Iloilo and Bacolod and Iloilo
Cities "have the most number of dengue cases," according to Resu.
However, "there is a considerable decline in the number of cases
reported from these areas," the report states.

Bacolod City has the highest number of cases at 1987; Negros Occ. has
1392. Iloilo province has 1076, while the city has 847. Elsewhere in
the region, Guimaras has 74; Aklan, 88; Antique, 62; and Capiz, 78.

Dawn has not yet broken, but already more than 1000 sick children
queue outside a hospital in Phnom Penh in a desperate wait to get
treatment for dengue, a mosquito-borne disease taking a heavy toll on
Cambodia's young.

Dengue -- which causes fever, headaches and agonizing muscle and
joint pains -- has killed 389 people in Cambodia this year [2007],
nearly all of them children, in what is believed to be one of the
worst outbreaks in years.

Outside the hospital, waiting children lie on reed mats on the
ground, their arms hooked up to saline drips hanging from the trees.

Dengue has infected more than 38 000 people in Cambodia so far this
year [2007], government figures show. "Every day, every 10 minutes, a
child is arriving in shock, without a pulse, and with no blood
pressure," said Beat Richner, a Swiss doctor and founder of 4
donor-funded hospitals in the war-scarred Southeast Asian nation.

In all, his clinics can treat 900 infants, but it is not enough.
"More will die as the dengue continues to spread," he said.

There is no vaccine for dengue, but even if a treatment existed, the
Health Ministry, which has an annual budget of USD 3 for each of
Cambodia's 13 million people, would struggle to afford it.

Instead, the Health Ministry focuses its efforts on prevention,
telling people in towns and villages to use mosquito nets, keep an
eye on their children, burn rubbish and not allow pools of stagnant
water, where the insects breed, to collect.

"We can change lots of things, but changing people's behaviour is
hardest of all," said Ngan Chantha, head of the ministry's
anti-dengue programme. "We tell them what to do, but as soon as we go
away, they revert to their old habits."

Many people disagree, saying it is impossible to keep an eye on
children when so many mothers and fathers have to work to provide for
their families in what remains one of the poorest countries in Asia.

"I am poor and can't afford a private clinic. Where should I go now?"
a 43-year-old woman shouted at the policemen keeping order at the
hospital gates, as she covered her 7-month-old granddaughter with a
wet cloth to keep her cool. The child's mother is working in one of
the many garment factories around Phnom Penh, leaving parental duties
to grandparents.

Even though dengue has always been a rainy season threat in the
tropical southeast Asian nation, Richner said this year [2007]
appeared to be the worst yet despite government and World Health
Organisation (WHO) campaigns.

He blamed the domestic and international authorities, which are
responding to higher-than-normal levels of dengue across the region,
for being slow to act even when it became clear in May that 2007 was
going to be a bad year. "That is very sad. It's a huge suffering for
the children," he said.

The WHO, United Nations Development Programme, Asian Development
Bank, and International Red Cross have all [contributed] to help
provide pesticides to kill mosquito larvae.

Richner's Kantha Bopha hospitals, which offer advanced medical
facilities to Cambodians for free, need USD 7 million a year to keep
themselves afloat, but the size of the dengue outbreak is already
causing them to eat into next year's [2008] budget.

Furthermore, raising cash is becoming harder because of Western
preoccupation with diseases like bird flu, he said. "Bird flu is a
threat to the Western world, so they pour money and commitment into
that," he said. "But dengue? There's no threat to the United States
or Europe so nobody's interested."

[In the last PRO/MBDS posting on dengue in Cambodia dated 30 Aug
2007, there had been reports of 34 542 confirmed cases with 365
deaths. According to the newswire above, there are now reports of
"more than 38 000 cases" and 389 deaths attributable to dengue this
year (2007). This represents a significant increase since the last report.

Unfortunately, the newswire report presented above has taken a
sensationalist approach to the situation in Cambodia at the expense
of the government and the international agencies assisting the
country in disease control efforts and appears to be a strategy to
appeal to international private donors to support a local
non-governmental organization (NGO).

At present, there is no commercially available vaccine to prevent
dengue virus infection. Hence, the only possible control measures are
related to reducing the contacts between the vectors (_Aedes_ spp.
mosquitoes) and the human population. Main strategies for doing so
involve vector reduction strategies, aimed at decreasing the
population of the vectors. This is done through mosquito
breeding-site elimination programs (reductions in standing water such
as in tires, vases, open plastic containers, etc.). This is also done
through the use of insecticidal approaches, use of larvicides and use
of adult mosquito cidal agents. The other strategy is to encourage
the use of insect repellents and to use impregnated bed nets to
reduce contact during the night (although the _Aedes_ spp. tend to do
their peak feeding during sun up and sun down periods of the day,
periods when people are not in their beds and would not be using a bed net).

Hospitals do not prevent infections with dengue virus (the morbidity
due to infection) other than to provide educational messages on how
to prevent infection with the virus. They do provide supportive
treatment for the complications that result from dengue virus
infections and can help to reduce the mortality associated with
dengue virus infections.

Dengue and malaria cases continue to trouble residents in
Pimpri-Chinchwad. In the last 6 days since Newsline reported the
figures, 40 new dengue and 31 malaria cases have been reported. In
the last 9 and 1/2 months, the official dengue cases have thus
reached 228, while malaria cases are put at 536. So far, 4 persons
have died of dengue and 3 of malaria.

Unofficially, dengue cases are put at over 450, while malaria cases
are said to have crossed the 1000 mark. "This is because 264 private
hospitals and 500 dispensaries do not report the cases to us. There
are very few private hospitals who keep us regularly updated," say
health department officials of the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation.

Health officials said most of the dengue and malaria cases have been
reported from construction sites. Pimple Saudagar, Rahatni, Wakad and
Indryani Nagar are the areas where a large number of dengue and
malaria cases are recorded.

"Construction sites, where cesspools and collection of fresh water in
ponds are common, are the breeding grounds of dengue and malaria,"
says PCMC health director Dr Rajshekhar Iyer, pointing out that the
brisk construction activity in these suburbs was spawning dengue and malaria.

The health department, says Dr Iyer, has been on a massive awareness
campaign in residential areas and the Pimpri-Chinchwad-Bhosari industrial belt.

"Builders have also been issued notices to remove pools of water and
take care of the health of their workers," he said, adding that
anti-larval measures and fogging operations have been in full swing
across the country. Last week, the health department had hired
artists to perform street plays for spreading awareness about dengue,
malaria and keeping surroundings clean.

Health chief Dr Nagkumar Kunachgi said the 3-seat rickshaws would
soon be introduced for collecting garbage in residential areas. "This
will ensure that no garbage is found littered in busy residential
areas," he said.

[Collection of garbage may be somewhat helpful in reducing _Aedes_
mosquito breeding sites, but success in eliminating larval habitats
to control dengue virus vectors will be in houses and other
buildings, where a variety of water catchments are certain to occur.

city of Pune, located in Maharastra state in SW India. A map of India

Kandy Municipal Corporation Chief Medical Officer Dr. Asoka Senarath
said that 28 suspected dengue cases have been detected in the Kandy
Municipal area this year [2007].

Dr. Senarath, who warned that there is a possibility of the disease
raising its head with the onset of current rains, said the council
needed the assistance and co-operation of the public in the area to combat it.

He said 112 suspected dengue patients had been treated at the Kandy
General Hospital during the last 10 months of this year [2007]. The
incidence this year is much less compared to last year [2006].

Meanwhile, the Kandy MC Medical Health unit conducted a door to door
public awareness campaign about dengue in the Kandy Municipal area
yesterday [17 Oct 2007] assisted by students of the Kandy D.S.
Senanayake Vidyalaya, St. Sylvester's College and Wariyapola
Sumangala Vidyalaya.

The Sindh Health Department's Monitoring Cell here Wednesday [17 Oct
2007] confirmed 3 more dengue fever induced deaths in the city,
bringing the total number of expired to 11.

Additional Health Secretary and Coordinator of the Cell Dr Shakil
Malik said 2 deaths, one each, were reported from Liaquat National
Hospital and Civil Hospital, Karachi on Tuesday [16 Oct 2007] and one
from Liaquat National Monday [15 Oct 2007].

"The number of dengue patients since 1 Aug 2007 has turned out to be
937, including 416 positive," Dr Shakil Malik said. More than 25 were
said to be hospitalised at different healthcare facilities, both
private and public sectors, across the city.

EDO - Health, Karachi City District Government, and Dr SA Sanjnani
said the city government was aware of the emerging situation.

All CDG-K healthcare facilities were said to be well equipped to
handle the situation.

"We are already engaged in regular fogging and fumigation of all
parts of the city to destroy breeding points and now are ensuring
provision for dengue fever tests and other relevant facilities to the
people," he elaborated.
