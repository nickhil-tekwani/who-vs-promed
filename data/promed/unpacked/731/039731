Concern over NSW management of disease
--------------------------------------
The Victorian Farmers Federation lacks confidence in the way Newcastle
Disease is being handled in New South Wales (NSW). Another case of the
disease, has been discovered at a broiler farm near Tamworth, in the north
of the State (NSW).
Although not supporting a motion to quarantine NSW, Meg Parkinson is not
confident authorities in the State are following agreed guidelines to
control the disease. Meg Parkinson said, "We feel the NSW department is not
following the procedures they have previously agreed to. All the state
governments, the commonwealth government, the territories, the chicken meat
and egg industries agreed to these procedures previously and that's what
we've put in the plan is the previous agreed procedures, and no, they're
not following them."
