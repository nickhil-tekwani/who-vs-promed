Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza In Turkey: Follow-up report No. 2
------------------------------------------------
Information received on 21 Oct 2005 from Dr Nihat Pakdil, General Director
of Protection and Control (GDPC), Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Affairs, Ankara:
End of previous report period: 13 Oct 2005
End of this report period: 20 Oct 2005.
Precise identification of agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza virus
type A, subtype H5N1.
Date of first confirmation of the event: 6 Oct 2005.
Date of start of the event: 1 Oct 2005.
Control measures:
Based on the initial test results from the national reference laboratory
(Bornova Veterinary Control and Research Institute), the local Veterinary
Service quarantined the affected holding on 6 Oct 2005. At that moment,
1700 of the 1800 birds had died. It was decided to cull immediately the 100
remaining live (and mainly sick) birds. All carcasses were buried that same
day with lime in 2 pits within the grounds of the farm.
In addition, the local Crisis Centre ordered the culling of:
- the 2684 free-range turkeys located about 1 km from the outbreak (direct
contact);
- backyard poultry in the protection zone (within a 3-km radius).
All culling was performed by gassing with carbon dioxide in bins. It
started on 8 Oct 2005 and was concluded on 16 Oct 2005.
The backyard poultry were mainly kept in the village of Kiziksa. They were
collected by the staff of the local Crisis Centre and killed and buried in
5 pits next to the waste site on the outskirts of the village. A total of
10 147 backyard poultry were culled. All poultry were in good condition and
no clinical problems were detected during the culling.
In the surveillance zone, a surveillance programme was put into place for
all poultry farms. All commercial and backyard flocks are clinically
controlled every 2 days.
Hunting of wild birds is forbidden throughout the country.
Vaccination prohibited: yes.

Final report: no.

Miscellaneous: Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus Detected In An
Import Quarantine Unit In The United Kingdom
------------------------------------------------
Information received on 24 Oct 2005 from Dr Debby Reynolds, Director
General for Animal Health and Welfare, Department for Environment, Food and
Rural Affairs (DEFRA), London:
Report date: 24 Oct 2005.
Highly pathogenic avian influenza serotype H5N1 has been detected in a
quarantine establishment in Essex, England.
The quarantine is approved under European Commission Decision 2000/666/EC
and consists of a single biosecure unit.
2 consignments of birds were sharing the unit. The 1st was a consignment of
148 psittacines imported from Surinam on 16 Sep 2005. The 2nd was a mixed
consignment of non-psittacines imported from Taipei China on 26 Sep 2005.
The birds were housed in a number of separate but adjacent pens in the same
airspace.
Sentinel chickens were also present in the unit during the quarantine period.
There were a number of deaths during the quarantine period. 2 carcasses
from the Surinam
consignment were examined post-mortem; virological tests at the VLA
Weybridge (Veterinary Laboratories Agency, United Kingdom; European Union
Reference Laboratory) were negative.
2 further dead birds were submitted for examination on 14 Oct. A pooled
sample was submitted for virology. On 21 Oct a virus was found of serotype
H5. On 23 Oct this was
confirmed as H5N1. The closest match is a strain identified in ducks in the
People's Republic of China earlier this year. It is not so similar to the
strains from Romania and Turkey. It is not a strain that the VLA has seen
before.
Our working hypothesis is that an infection in the birds from Surinam is
likely to have arisen in the quarantine system, most likely in the facility
in Essex where the Surinam birds shared airspace with the birds from Taipei
China.
All the remaining birds in the quarantine unit were humanely killed on 21
Oct 2005 and the carcasses sent for incineration. The quarantine building
is being cleansed and disinfected.
Movements on and off the premises have been investigated and no evidence of
disease spread has been found. No live birds were removed from the
quarantine unit during the quarantine period.
Further investigations are continuing, including virological examination of
birds which died or were killed, including the sentinel chickens.
This incident occurred in an officially approved quarantine unit and there
is no indication that biosecurity has been breached. The United Kingdom
therefore remains free from avian influenza.

Miscellaneous: Following Detection of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza
Virus in an Import Quarantine Unit in The United Kingdom, Taipei China
Reiterates That it is Free of Avian Influenza
-----------------------------------------------------
Information received on 26 Oct 2005 from Dr Tien-Jye Chang, Dean,
Department of Veterinary Medicine, National Chung Hsing University, Taipei:
Report date: 26 Oct 2005.
The Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine (BAPHIQ)
said that Taipei China is free from avian influenza. The 185 birds exported
from Taipei China to the United Kingdom on 27 Sep 2005 were healthy and in
compliance with the quarantine requirement of the United Kingdom.
Upon receipt of the news release from DEFRA, saying that H5N1 avian
influenza virus was found in a parrot from Surinam in the quarantine
facility where the birds shared airspace with birds from Taipei China,
BAPHIQ dispatched animal health inspection officers on 22 Oct 2005 to the
farm of origin to examine the health status of the birds. All birds on the
farm were healthy.
Throat and cloacal swabs from the birds on the farm were sampled and tested
for avian influenza on 25 Oct 2005. The RT-PCR tests for H5N1 gave negative
results. This indicates that the H5N1 virus isolated from the Surinam
parrot by the United Kingdom in a quarantine facility is unrelated to the
birds exported from Taipei China.
BAPHIQ reiterates that Taipei China is free of avian influenza.

[The final results of UK's investigation into the origin and the chronology
of the H5N1 case(s) in the (private) Essex quarantine facility are
anticipated with interest. Were the flights of the Surinam and Taiwan
consignments direct from the respective countries of origin, or have they
-- or similar/earlier captive-birds consignments to the UK -- experienced
stopovers in foreign airports, in Europe or elsewhere? In case affirmative,
could undesirable cross-contacts be excluded? - Mod.AS]
