[We are assuming a "warning" is more significant than an "alert", hence
this posting. - Mod. CHC
Territory Health Services [THS has renewed a warning to residents and
visitors throughout the Northern Territory [NT to take precautions against
the potentially fatal mosquito-borne disease Australian encephalitis, and
Kunjin virus disease. The sentinel chicken program, which acts as an early
warning system, has shown recent evidence of Murray Valley encephalitis
[MVE virus activity in the Alice Springs area of the Central Australia
region and of Kunjin virus in the Tennant Creek area of the Barkly region.
This warning follows an earlier warning in March when MVE activity was
detected at Beatrice Hill near the wetlands of the Adelaide River. The
latest information indicates that there is a current risk from these
viruses from the north coast of the NT to Central Australia.
Australian encephalitis, caused by Murray Valley encephalitis virus, is a
potentially fatal illness. The normal symptoms of Australian encephalitis
are severe headache, stiff neck, high fever, and in some cases the disease
progresses to delirium, and coma. Kunjin virus disease, caused by Kunjin
virus, causes a generally more mild disease with fever and severe headache.
The Health Department of WA has also advised that sentinel chickens have
recently detected recent widespread MVE virus and Kunjin virus activity in
the Kimberley and Pilbara regions of WA. There has also been some activity
in the Gascoyne and the Murchison regions.
These two viruses are seasonally present in the northwest of WA and the Top
End [i.e., the northern part of the Northern Territory during most years,
and can extend into the Barkly and Central Australian areas in wet years.
Both are transmitted by the bite of the common banded mosquito (_Culex
annulirostris_), which occurs in highest numbers during and just after the
wet season. Not all of these mosquitoes will be carrying a virus, and only
one person in approximately one thousand who get bitten by mosquitoes with
the virus will get the disease.
In the Top End, numbers of the common banded mosquito will be particularly
high near large swampy areas, coastal and river flood plains, and along the
larger river and creek systems. This mosquito will also be high in all the
recently flooded areas of the Victoria River and Barkly areas. Areas of
Central Australia that have been recently flooded will also be areas of
high numbers of this mosquito.
There are currently a high number of the common banded mosquitoes in the
Ilparpa area of rural Alice Springs. This area is regarded as having a
higher risk, as compared with other areas of Alice Springs. There is a risk
of infection from these viruses over most of the NT wherever mosquito
numbers are relatively high or where people experience mosquito pest problems.
THS advise that there is no vaccine for Australian encephalitis or Kunjin
virus disease and that the only protection is to avoid being bitten by
mosquitoes. THS recommend that people throughout the NT take extra
precautions against mosquito bites over the next two months. This
particularly applies to people visiting and camping in or near swamp and
river systems during the evening and night, and in rural areas near sites
of relatively high mosquito activity.
People are advised to:
· Avoid outdoor exposure around dusk and at night in all areas of high
mosquito activity.
· Reduce outdoor activity in the evening and at night in all areas if
mosquitoes are present.
· Use mosquito proof accommodation, mosquito nets and mosquito proof tents
at night in all areas.
· Wear protective clothing including light coloured clothing with long
sleeves, long trousers, and socks, between dusk and dawn in areas where
mosquito bites are likely.
· Use a protective repellent containing diethyl toluamide (DEET) as a
supplement to protective clothing when outdoors at night in areas of
mosquito activity. The most effective and long lasting formulations are
those in lotions or gels. Most natural or organic repellents are not as
effective as DEET. Electronic repellers and mosquito traps are not
effective self-protection devices.
· Ensure children are adequately protected against mosquito bites.
· Ensure domestic animals are protected in areas of high mosquito activity.

[Kunjin virus is a close relative of West Nile virus, which does not occur
in Australia. I wouldn't let this report influence my travel to Australia,
were I someone who was planning such a trip. Heck, what's a little virus
with crocs, sun, snakes, and box jellyfish? Greatest place in the world.
Nothing like a little adventure to stir the soul. - Mod. CHC
