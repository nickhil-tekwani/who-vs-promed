California Department of Public Health (CDPH) director Dr Ron Chapman on Fri 10 Aug 2012, warned consumers not to eat shucked and in-shell raw oysters from Drakes Bay Oyster Company because they may be contaminated with _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_, a bacterium that can cause serious illness.

To date, 3 illnesses in California have been linked to the products. Drakes Bay Oyster Company, an Inverness, California oyster grower has initiated a voluntarily recall of the affected shucked and in-shell raw oyster products. The shucked oysters are packaged under the Drakes Bay Oyster Farm label and sold in 9 ounce, 1-pint, 1-quart, and half-gallon jars or tubs. The affected shucked products are labeled with lot numbers 363 through 421. The lot number can be found on the top label of each jar or tub. The in-shell raw oysters are sold individually or in bags ranging in size from 1 dozen to 10 dozen. In-shell raw oyster tags are marked with harvest dates ranging from 17 Jul 2012 through 8 Aug 2012.

A complete list of the recalled products and photos of the shellfish tag and shucked oyster jar or tub labeling can be found at the CDPH website (http://www.cdph.ca.gov/pubsforms/Documents/fdbFrDRAn.pdf). CDPH advises consumers who purchased the affected oyster products to throw them away immediately.

Symptoms of _V. parahaemolyticus_ infection include vomiting, abdominal cramps, watery diarrhea, headache, fever, and chills. Most infected people recover without treatment in a few days. Severe illness and death from _V. parahaemolyticus_ infection is rare, but can occur with chronic liver disease, cancer, or other conditions that weaken the immune system.

[It should be recalled that _V. parahaemolyticus_ is normal marine water flora during the warmer months and not related to contamination with sewage. The range of cases seems to be enlarging to climates where it had not been seen before related to the phenomenon of global warming. - Mod.LL
