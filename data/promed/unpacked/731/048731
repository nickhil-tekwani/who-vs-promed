An anthrax outbreak that affected Kenya's Lake Nakuru National Park is over, and the last buffalo death was recorded on 10 May [2019], the country's wildlife conservation agency said on Saturday [25 May 2019]. John Waweru, director general of Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), said in a statement that the total mortalities to date are 145 buffaloes representing 3.54% of the estimated population of 4100 buffaloes in Lake Nakuru National Park.

"Our partnership with the local administration and department of Public Health as well as directorate of Veterinary Services to educate the local communities about anthrax and our surveillance and monitoring efforts have paid off," Waweru said.

Lake Nakuru National Park which is about 160 km [99 mi] northwest of Kenya's capital city, Nairobi, covers an area of 188 sq km [73 sq mi] and is an important ecosystem supporting high diversity of waterfowl, large mammal, and floral species. "It was set up as the 1st rhino sanctuary in Kenya and has been a successful breeding habitat. The park hosts a number of threatened mammal species, including lion, leopard, and the Rothschild giraffe. Five globally threatened bird species are also found in the park," he added.

He noted that the park management would continue with the monitoring and will report any suspicious deaths for urgent action by veterinary authorities.

The KWS official said that management would also undertake other long-term measures to mitigate such disease outbreaks, noting that prolonged drought is a risk factor in anthrax outbreaks. "This results in depletion of pasture, forcing animals to graze closer to the soil that is potentially infested with anthrax spores. The park has a previous history of anthrax outbreak in July 2015."

Waweru revealed that the long-term measures include translocation of buffaloes from the park to avoid depletion of pastures during prolonged dry spells, which are becoming more frequent.

[Overall, a very professional response. Wildlife outbreaks can frequently involve large numbers of animals. This happens when biting flies (Tabanids) get involved and widen the target both in space and in numbers. This is not to ignore the occasional dead animal, but these are frequently missed against the background of normal sporadic mortality and the efficiency of vultures and buzzards in rapidly identifying and disposing of carcasses, though it is a messy business. These singular carcasses should be burnt where found. - Mod MHJ
