Hundreds of people have been struck down by what Cambodian medical
officials say is a mass poisoning at a former Khmer Rouge stronghold
in the country's northwest.
More than 600 people have been affected in the village of Bos Thom,
some 400 km. northwest of Phnom Penh.
Six people have reportedly gone blind; others have stomach cramps,
fever, and diarrhea after drinking from the area's only source of
water, a local pond.
It is unclear whether the pond became poisonous due to natural causes
or to deliberate contamination.
Around 180 families live in the area, which AFP reports is home to
many former Khmer Rouge fighters.

[The clinical signs of blindness immediately make one think of methyl
alcohol. However, methyl alcohol does not often produce fever. Fever
and diarrhea may lead us to think more about bacterial or viral
infections. There is not much to go on in the way of understanding
what the poison may have been. Certainly we will hope for some
laboratory confirmation and an authoritative report. - Mod.TG]
