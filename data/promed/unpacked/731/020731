Dr Humberto Rivera Almaguer, head of the Zoonosis Program in [Holguín] province, warned that an increase in morbidity and mortality of leptospirosis has been observed in the territory, as a result of increased rainfall and contact with wastewater, essentially in livestock areas.

This disease is essentially transmitted by rodents, but animal husbandry can be another source of infection, through contact with the urine of infected animals such as dogs, cattle, pigs, or horses; hence the need to employ protective measures.

Among the most important clinical manifestations of this disease are fever, headache, and muscle pain, especially in the calves, vomiting, diarrhea, and general malaise.

According to the also official of the Provincial Center of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Microbiology: "regarding the behavior of leptospirosis and the need to consolidate the main prevention and control actions, according to the current requirements for its control, we need the population to know the measures to avoid contracting the disease.

"Among them, it is recommended to control rodents through communal hygiene in areas where animals are kept, and personal hygiene; avoid swimming in puddles, rivers, or dams; identify sick animals and avoid contact with their urine and feces; guarantee the vaccination of risk groups and that those who present symptoms consult a doctor in a timely manner to prevent complications and serious illness."

The bacterium that causes the disease has been determined to live from weeks to months in water and soil contaminated with the urine of these animals.

Doxycycline is used as a prophylactic treatment for this disease since, without treatment, it can cause kidney and liver damage and even death.

When leptospirosis is suspected, medical personnel are the only ones authorized to diagnose or rule out the disease. The nearest care center should be consulted, especially when the person has been exposed in a risk area.
