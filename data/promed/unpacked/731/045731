Bird flu found in wild ducks in west Turkey - minister
-----------------------------------------------
Turkey's farm minister said on Friday [6 Jan 2006] that bird flu had been
detected in 2 wild ducks near the capital, Ankara, nearly 1000 km (700
miles) west of infected areas where 3 children died of the disease in
recent days.
"The disease has been identified in 2 wild ducks near a dam at Nallihan
(about 100 km west of Ankara)," Agriculture Minister Mehdi Eker told a
televised news conference called to brief reporters on the situation in
eastern Turkey. [Map at

The discovery suggests migratory birds may be spreading the disease across
the large country, as experts had warned.
Bird flu 1st surfaced in Turkey last October [2005] in a corner of western
Turkey near the Sea of Marmara, further west than Nallihan, but authorities
declared that infected area clear of the disease last month [December 2005]
after imposing quarantine measures.

[This piece of information -- if confirmed -- might be, epidemiologically,
of significance. Data on the clinical status of the suspected wild ducks,
their accurate identity (species) and lab test results will help. It
remains to be investigated whether there are no AI outbreaks in domestic
poultry in the area.
Reportedly, the Nallihan area is characterized by wetlands with an
abundance of water birds, such as gulls, herons and ducks; for a report of
bird watchers' visit to the Nallihan "Bird Paradise," see
