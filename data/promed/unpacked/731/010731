Reason for notification: Reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 30 Jan 2011
Manifestation of disease: Clinical disease
Causal agent: Myxoma virus
Nature of diagnosis: Clinical, laboratory (basic and advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Papatlazolco, Papatlazolco, Huauchinango, Puebla
Date of start of the outbreak: 14 Oct 2015
Outbreak status: Continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Backyard
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Rabbits / 8 / 8 / 1 / 0 / 0

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comment: Following farmer's notification, who reported that his animals were sick, a visit to the production unit was made and it was observed that the animals showed tearing, conjunctivitis, subcutaneous myxoma on the neck and respiratory problems; samples were then taken and sent to the SENASICA Diagnosis Laboratory. When looking for cases in the area, 9 backyards were identified, of which 2 were positive to agar-gel immunodiffusion. Epidemiological investigation is ongoing.

Control measures
Measures applied: Movement control inside the country, screening, disinfection/disinfestations, quarantine, stamping out, no vaccination, no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Level 3 Biosecurity Laboratory, SENASICA (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Rabbits / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 16 Oct 2015 / Positive
Rabbits / virus isolation / 3 Nov 2015 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2015, chapter 2.6.1 "Myxomatosis" at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.06.01_MYXO.pdf from which the following commentary is quoted:

"Myxomatosis is a major viral disease of wild and domestic European rabbits (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_) caused by the Myxoma virus (MYXV), a poxvirus (family Poxviridae; subfamily Chordopoxvirinae; genus Leporipoxvirus) 1st isolated from a colony of laboratory rabbits in Uruguay in 1898.

The natural hosts are 2 leporides: _Sylvilagus brasiliensis_ in South America (South American strains) and _S. bachmani_ (Californian strains) in California, USA in which the viral strains produce only a benign fibroma. Following deliberate introductions into Australia and Europe as a biological control for wild European rabbits, MYXV now has a worldwide distribution, is endemic in wild European rabbit populations, and can spill over into farmed, laboratory and pet rabbits. European hares may rarely develop generalised disease. Wild rabbits act as reservoirs, and insects (mainly mosquitoes and fleas but also midges and lice) can transmit the virus to domestic rabbits. Where there is close proximity between rabbits (i.e. in farmed animals), virus may also be transmitted by direct contact. MYXV is shed in ocular and nasal secretions or from skin lesions and it is also potentially present in semen and genital secretions. There is no age or sex predilection.

Two forms of the disease are observed: the nodular (classical) form and the amyxomatous (respiratory) form. Nodular myxomatosis is naturally transmitted by biting insects and mainly observed in wild and pet rabbits and in small-scale rabbitries. It is characterised by florid skin lesions and severe immune dysfunction, accompanied by supervening bacterial infections of the respiratory tract.

The clinical signs of amyxomatous myxomatosis are mainly respiratory: it has fewer, smaller, cutaneous lesions than the nodular type, although many of the clinical signs are typical of myxomatosis such as the cutaneous lesion at the inoculation site, perineal oedema, swollen eyelids, blepharoconjunctivitis and rhinitis. The amyxomatous form is regarded as more significant for farmed rabbits.

There is no known risk of human infection with MYXV." - Mod.CRD
