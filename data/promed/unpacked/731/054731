A team of veterinary researchers at Iowa State University [ISU] has pinpointed a virus that has caused mysterious tremors in piglets dating back decades. The virus, which comes from a family known as "pestiviruses", infects young pigs and can cause them to shake involuntarily. Afflicted piglets are sometimes referred to as "shaker pigs" or "dancing pigs" and, in severe cases, the tremors prevent pigs from nursing and can lead to starvation.

Veterinarians have recognized the congenital tremors for years but could never pinpoint the cause until now, says Bailey Arruda, an assistant professor and veterinary pathologist in the ISU Department of Veterinary Diagnostic and Production Animal Medicine. "It's been a mystery in the veterinary community for over 90 years," Arruda says. "Unfortunately, we didn't have the technology to find the virus before."

The team of researchers, in collaboration with Missouri-based animal health company Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica, utilized next-generation DNA sequencing techniques to detect the virus in samples from affected pigs. The team then used those results to experimentally reproduce the tremors in newborn pigs.

Earlier sequencing techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction or PCR, require researchers to identify a target before beginning the process. "But that approach wouldn't be useful in this case because we didn't know exactly what we were looking for," Arruda says.

Now that the researchers have identified the virus, she says the ISU Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory can now use PCR tests to confirm cases from samples sent in from local veterinarians. The next step is to develop a vaccine to combat the virus, she says.

Paulo Arruda, an assistant professor in veterinary diagnostic and production animal medicine, says piglets with congenital tremors are fairly uncommon, though the virus can appear in cycles. While the virus isn't creating widespread problems for the pork industry, it can become particularly problematic on individual farms, he says.

Drew Magstadt, a clinician in veterinary diagnostic and production animal medicine and research team member, says the virus doesn't make pork unsafe to eat, and he stressed that the virus isn't known to infect humans.

[In the late 1960s I had the privilege of joining Jack Done and his colleagues in the Pathology Department, henceforth known as the Department of Pathology & Epidemiology, at the Central Veterinary Laboratory, MAFF, or "Weybridge". Jack and David Harding had been closely involved in the diagnosis of classical swine fever (CSF) cases leading up to its eradication and the clarification of the shaker piglets occasionally seen on CSF affected pig farms. Jack recruited Tony Wrathal, a teratologist, and together they infected pig 4 and 8 cell embryos with classical swine fever virus (CSFV) in its various forms, one of which was really good at producing congenitally affected piglets with the shakes. The Worcester VIO requested the team to expand its interests to "border disease" (hypomyelinogenesis congenita) in sheep along the Welsh border. Border disease is due to Border disease virus 2 (BDV-2). I did the field investigations on how flocks were affected and in collecting affected lambs for Stan Terleki, our ovine pathologist. It was one of the most fun times of my scientific life. Including Lionel Markson, bovine pathologist, they were a truly outstanding team of pathologists.

The ISU team have identified their affected piglets as being infected with a pestivirus, the genus to which classical swine fever virus or hog cholera virus (HCV), if you prefer, belongs. I suspect that the ISU people have just stumbled on some herds congenitally affected with CSF or HC. As this classical disease is meant to have been eradicated in the US, they have opened an interesting door. - Mod.MHJ

Interestingly, border disease (BD), rightly referred to by Mod MHJ, is also caused by a pestivirus (BDV), closely related to classical swine fever virus and bovine virus diarrhea. The disease derived its name from the fact that it was first reported (1959) from the border region of England and Wales; however, its distribution is worldwide. Nearly all isolates of BDV are non-cytopathogenic in cell culture. Clinical signs in sheep include barren ewes, abortions, stillbirths and the birth of small weak lambs. Affected lambs can show tremor, abnormal body conformation and hairy fleeces (so-called 'hairy-shaker' lambs). Vertical transmission plays an important role in the epidemiology of the disease. Infection of fetuses can result in the birth of persistently infected lambs. BDV was found, several times, as a contaminant of live vaccines. Its non-cytopathic nature prescribes special measures in the safety tests of live vaccines for farm animals. - Mod.AS

Bovine viral diarrhea virus, is usually (at least in the USA) abbreviated BVD, and rarely BVDV.
There are multiple subtypes of BD (border disease) and BVD (bovine viral diarrhea).
Border disease virus 2 (BD-2), (border disease has at least 2 subtypes).
Bovine viral diarrhea virus has at least 3 subtypes (BVDV-3) (HoBi group is another cattle disease in the same pestivirus genus).
All of these diseases are in the genus _Pestivirus_, family _Flaviviridae_. - Mod.TG
