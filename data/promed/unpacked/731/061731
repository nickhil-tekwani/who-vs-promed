Older patients more likely to report long-COVID symptoms
--------------------------------------------------------
Among patients seen at long-COVID clinics in 4 countries, older people were the most likely to report symptoms and have abnormal chest imaging and lung function tests, finds a study published late last week in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases.

Researchers in Israel, Italy, Spain, and Switzerland followed 2333 COVID-19 survivors for an average of 5 months to compare symptoms between patients ages 18 to 65 years and those 66 years and older and identify risk factors for persistent fatigue and shortness of breath.

Average patient age was 51 years, 20.5% were 66 years and older, and all were interviewed at one of 5 hospital-based long-COVID clinics or through phone interviews from May 2020 to March 2021.

Increased abnormal chest imaging, dysfunction
---------------------------------------------
Women made up a greater proportion of the younger group than the older group (51.6% vs 39.5%). Older patients were more likely than their younger counterparts to smoke (41.9% vs 29.5%), be sedentary (49.5% vs 28.2%), and have more underlying illnesses and medication use.

Older patients also had higher rates of severe or critical COVID-19 (58.4% vs 24.4%) and hospital admission (79.1% vs 39.8%) and longer average hospital stays (18 vs 13 days). The only symptom significantly more common in the older group during the acute infection was shortness of breath (64.3% vs 56.6%).

While older participants more often reported cough and joint pain as part of long-COVID symptoms, the younger group reported more sore throats, nasal congestion, headaches, chest pains, heart palpitations, impaired concentration, emotional distress, and loss of smell and taste.

The older group visited the recovery clinic roughly 1 month sooner than younger participants (average days after infection, 123 vs 150) and more often reported a symptom (80% vs 64.2%). But both groups had comparable rates of potentially disabling symptoms (34.1% vs 32.8%), including fatigue and shortness of breath (fatigue, 38.7% vs 39.4%; shortness of breath, 29.9% vs 27.3%).

After acute infection, older patients more often reported increased physical activity (29.2% vs 8.2%), while younger patients tended to report a decline (28.8% vs 16.3%). The older group had higher rates of abnormal chest imaging at their recovery-clinic visit (23.2% vs 10.1%), as well as evidence of lung dysfunction, including impaired forced expiratory volume in 1 second, total lung capacity, and carbon monoxide diffusing capacity.

Link to obesity, female sex
---------------------------
In the older group, risk factors for persistent fatigue included female sex, smoking, obesity, and high blood pressure, with independent associations for obesity (odds ratio [OR], 1.6), female sex (OR, 2.1), and shorter interval between acute infection and recovery-clinic evaluation (OR, 1.6). Older age, however, was not tied to lingering fatigue (OR, 0.8).

Among older participants, female sex, pre-COVID physical activity level, obesity, high blood pressure, and severe COVID-19 were linked to higher rates of persistent shortness of breath, with independent associations for obesity (OR, 1.7), female sex (OR, 1.7), low pre-COVID physical activity level (OR 1.6), chronic pulmonary disease (OR, 2.0), and shorter interval between infection and recovery-clinic evaluation (OR. 2.1).

Higher rates of severe infection and hospitalization likely contributed to the slightly greater persistent symptom burden among older participants, the researchers said. "Higher rates of severe COVID-19 with subsequent deconditioning, diminished baseline muscle mass and pulmonary reserve, as well as comorbidities, are assumed to play a role," they wrote.

The authors called for further prospective, long-term follow-up to better characterize the natural history and recovery patterns of older COVID-19 survivors with lingering symptoms.

"The exceedingly high numbers of COVID-19 recoverees together with the high prevalence of long COVID among the elderly population indicate a need for clinical attention and resource allocation for long COVID among older adults," they concluded. "Possible interventions aimed at promoting rehabilitation and well-being of this susceptible population should be assessed in comparative trials."

"Highlights:
- This study evaluated 2333 individuals at hospital-based COVID recovery clinics.
- Older adults are more likely to report on long COVID symptoms.
- The most common long COVID symptoms among older adults are fatigue and dyspnea.
- Older age does not correlate with long COVID fatigue or dyspnea.
- Obesity is an independent risk factor for both long COVID fatigue and dyspnea."

"Conclusions:
Older individuals with long-COVID, have different persisting symptoms, with more pronounced pulmonary impairment. Women and individuals with obesity are at risk. Further research is warranted to investigate the natural history of long-COVID among the elderly population and to assess possible interventions aimed at promoting rehabilitation and well-being."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused >3.5 million deaths worldwide and affected >160 million people. At least twice as many have been infected but remained asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic. COVID-19 includes central nervous system manifestations mediated by inflammation and cerebrovascular, anoxic, and/or viral neurotoxicity mechanisms. More than one third of patients with COVID-19 develop neurologic problems during the acute phase of the illness, including loss of sense of smell or taste, seizures, and stroke. Damage or functional changes to the brain may result in chronic sequelae. The risk of incident cognitive and neuropsychiatric complications appears independent from the severity of the original pulmonary illness. It behooves the scientific and medical community to attempt to understand the molecular and/or systemic factors linking COVID-19 to neurologic illness, both short and long term.

Methods
This article describes what is known so far in terms of links among COVID-19, the brain, neurological symptoms, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias. We focus on risk factors and possible molecular, inflammatory, and viral mechanisms underlying neurological injury. We also provide a comprehensive description of the Alzheimer's Association Consortium on Chronic Neuropsychiatric Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (CNS SC2) harmonized methodology to address these questions using a worldwide network of researchers and institutions.

Results
Successful harmonization of designs and methods was achieved through a consensus process initially fragmented by specific interest groups (epidemiology, clinical assessments, cognitive evaluation, biomarkers, and neuroimaging). Conclusions from subcommittees were presented to the whole group and discussed extensively. Presently data collection is ongoing at 19 sites in 12 countries representing Asia, Africa, the Americas, and Europe.

Discussion
The Alzheimer's Association Global Consortium harmonized methodology is proposed as a model to study long-term neurocognitive sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Key Points
• The following review describes what is known so far in terms of molecular and epidemiological links among COVID-19, the brain, neurological symptoms, and AD and related dementias (ADRD)
• The primary objective of this large-scale collaboration is to clarify the pathogenesis of ADRD and to advance our understanding of the impact of a neurotropic virus on the long-term risk of cognitive decline and other CNS sequelae. No available evidence supports the notion that cognitive impairment after SARS-CoV-2 infection is a form of dementia (ADRD or otherwise). The longitudinal methodologies espoused by the consortium are intended to provide data to answer this question as clearly as possible controlling for possible confounders. Our specific hypothesis is that SARS-CoV-2 triggers ADRD-like pathology following the extended olfactory cortical network (EOCN) in older individuals with specific genetic susceptibility.
• The proposed harmonization strategies and flexible study designs offer the possibility to include large samples of under-represented racial and ethnic groups, creating a rich set of harmonized cohorts for future studies of the pathophysiology, determinants, long-term consequences, and trends in cognitive aging, ADRD, and vascular disease.
• We provide a framework for current and future studies to be carried out within the Consortium. and offers a "green paper" to the research community with a very broad, global base of support, on tools suitable for low- and middle-income countries aimed to compare and combine future longitudinal data on the topic.
• The Consortium proposes a combination of design and statistical methods as a means of approaching causal inference of the COVID-19 neuropsychiatric sequelae. We expect that deep phenotyping of neuropsychiatric sequelae may provide a series of candidate syndromes with phenomenological and biological characterization that can be further explored. By generating high-quality harmonized data across sites we aim to capture both descriptive and, where possible, causal associations.

[3] Delirium and brain fog
Date: Wed 5 Oct 2022
Source: The Guardian [edited]
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/05/immune-reactions-to-severe-covid-may-trigger-brain-problems-study-finds?CMP=oth_b-aplnews_d-1 https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-022-01741-1


Immune reactions to severe COVID may trigger brain problems, study finds
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Severe COVID infections can cause immune reactions that damage nerve cells in the brain, causing memory problems and confusion, and potentially raising the risk of long-term health issues, research suggests.

Scientists at King's College London found that a wayward immune response to the virus increased the death rate of neurons and had a "profound" impact on regeneration in the hippocampus region of the brain, which is crucial for learning and memory.

The findings are preliminary but suggest COVID can trigger neurological problems in patients without the virus having to infect the brain itself. The process is believed to underpin delirium in COVID patients, but may also contribute to brain fog and other problems experienced by people with long COVID.

"These neurological symptoms are very concerning for patients and their families, and the hope is that our research can help identify which treatments would be most appropriate to lessen or prevent these symptoms," said Carmine Pariante, a professor of biological psychiatry at KCL's Institute of Psychiatry, and senior author on the study.

The researchers analysed blood from 36 COVID patients admitted to Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust in London in the 1st wave of the pandemic. They found that levels of a protein called IL-6, which immune cells release as a rallying call for other immune cells, were more than 15 times higher than normal in infected individuals.

But an even more dramatic rise in IL-6 was found in COVID patients with delirium -- a state of extreme confusion that can leave people not knowing who, or where, they are. In these patients, IL-6 was 6 times higher than in other COVID patients. Nearly a third of COVID patients admitted to hospital experience delirium, rising to 2/3 in severe cases.

The scientists then investigated how high levels of IL-6 might affect neurons in the hippocampus by exposing lab-grown nerve cells to the patients' blood. They found that blood from patients with delirium increased the normal death rate of neurons and reduced the generation of new brain cells. The damage caused is thought to drive delirium.

The harmful effects were traced back to a cascade of events where IL-6 triggers the release of 2 related immune proteins, called IL-12 and IL-13. Dr Alessandra Borsini, the study's 1st author, said the impact of the proteins on generating new brain cells was "profound".

However, blocking the proteins protected brain cells from damage, the scientists report in Molecular Psychiatry. The work suggests drugs known as Janus kinase inhibitors, which are already used to calm dangerous immune reactions to COVID, might combat delirium and its knock-on effects. [Borsini, A., Merrick, B., Edgeworth, J. et al. Neurogenesis is disrupted in human hippocampal progenitor cells upon exposure to serum samples from hospitalized COVID-19 patients with neurological symptoms. Mol Psychiatry (2022)]

Older people are particularly vulnerable to delirium after a range of infections and operations. The state of confusion leads to a substantial rise in the risk of dementia.

"We believe these proteins are responsible for the delirium symptoms in acute COVID patients, and in general in long COVID patients experiencing neurological symptoms," Borsini said. Measuring the levels of the immune proteins in patients could help personalise their treatment, she added.

Dr Thomas Jackson, a geriatrician who studies delirium and inflammation at the University of Birmingham, said: "What they've been able to show is that increased inflammation has a direct effect on brain cells which we know are linked to delirium and memory problems. The reduction in repair mechanisms and regeneration might begin to explain why people with delirium can have longer term cognitive problems."

He said the same immune reaction may contribute to the "brain fog" some COVID patients report, which can persist for months after infection. But confirmation will need to come from further work, he said, such as the COVID-CNS study, which is investigating 800 UK patients who had neurological or neuropsychiatric complications from COVID.

[4] Paxlovid rebound and COVID-related health worker burnout
Date: Mon 3 Oct 2022
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/10/covid-19-scan-oct-03-2022


Study: Paxlovid effective for COVID-19, not tied to higher risk of rebound
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The oral antiviral drug Paxlovid is safe and effective for treating COVID-19 and carries no additional risk of viral rebound beyond other treatments, according to a meta-analysis published late last week in the Journal of Infection.

Paxlovid is recommended for treating patients who have mild or moderate COVID-19 and are at high risk for severe illness. Cases of viral rebound after Paxlovid treatment have been widely reported, including that of US President Joe Biden, who tested positive for COVID-19 after Paxlovid treatment in July [2022].

Researchers from Guizhou Medical University in Guiyang, China, led the meta-analysis of 13 controlled trials that included 186 306 patients published from 1 Dec 2021 to 20 Sep 2022. The studies compared the use of Paxlovid with either usual care or a placebo and/or another drug (e.g., a different antiviral, monoclonal antibodies).

Of the 13 studies, 3 found no difference in the risk of viral rebound in the Paxlovid and control groups (odds ratio [OR] of rebound among Paxlovid patients vs controls, 0.99). Five studies on adverse-event rates identified no difference between the Paxlovid and control groups (OR, 1.07).

Among the 7 studies on the effectiveness of Paxlovid in preventing death or hospitalization, the OR of death in the Paxlovid versus the control group was 0.12, indicating an 88% reduction. The OR of hospitalization in the 2 groups was 0.32, a 68% reduction after Paxlovid.

The study authors said that COVID-19 rebound is not unique to Paxlovid. "There has been more attention to COVID-19 rebounds following Paxlovid treatment, which may be attributable to more people being treated with Paxlovid," they wrote. "However, the phenomenon of rebounds following Paxlovid treatment reinforces the importance of testing for individuals with recurrent symptoms after Paxlovid treatment."

[Citation: Qian Zheng, Pengfei Ma, Mingwei Wang, et al. Efficacy and safety of Paxlovid for COVID-19: a meta-analysis. J Infec. Published 30 Sep 2022 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2022.09.027

... In conclusion, our research shows that Paxlovid for COVID-19 is effective and safe. COVID-19 rebound is not unique to Paxlovid. There is no significant difference of rebound in Paxlovid group and control group. There has been more attention to COVID-19 rebounds following Paxlovid treatment, which may be attributable to more people being treated with Paxlovid. However, the phenomenon of rebounds following Paxlovid treatment reinforces the importance of testing for individuals with recurrent symptoms after Paxlovid treatment.]

Healthcare workers experienced 3 times as much burnout during pandemic
----------------------------------------------------------------------
New research from the Queen Mary University of London and other UK researchers shows that even when rates of mental health issues are similar, healthcare professionals who worked during the COVID-19 pandemic were 3.3 times more likely to experience burnout than other professionals. The research is published in BJPsych Open.

The study was based on online surveys of UK professionals, which assessed anxiety, depression, insomnia, burnout, and low emotional wellbeing. A total of 1574 healthcare workers and 147 non-healthcare professionals completed the survey. Seventy percent of participants were female, and 70% were over the age of 35. Two-thirds identified as White (66%) and just under a quarter identified as Asian (22.3%).

The surveys were conducted in July through September of 2020, in November and December of 2020, and in early spring 2021, during a 2nd UK national lockdown.

There were no significant differences in rates of anxiety or depression during each phase, but healthcare workers had a 2.5-fold increased risk of burnout during the 2nd phase of surveys (emotional exhaustion: odds ratio [OR], 2.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15 to 5.46; P = 0.02), which increased to a 3.3-fold increased risk during the 2nd UK lockdown (OR, 3.32; 95% CI, 1.40 to 7.87; P = 0.006).

Burnout decreased over time across the 3 periods, but healthcare workers directly treating patients still had a 2.7-fold increased risk of burnout by the 2nd UK lockdown -- the highest level among subgroups.

"Unless we can stop the burnout trend, we could see more mental health and physical consequences such as cardiovascular and metabolic diseases in our doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers," said Ajay Gupta, MD, senior author of the study, in a Queen Mary University press release.

COVID continues slow global decline but rises in Europe
-------------------------------------------------------
In its latest weekly update on the pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) said today [5 Oct 2022] that global COVID-19 cases declined 6% last week compared to the previous week, though the pace of activity increased in the European region, which experienced an 8% rise compared to the week before.

Of more than 2.9 million cases reported to the WHO last week, the 5 countries reporting the most cases were Germany, the United States, Japan, China, and France.

Deaths also declined, with levels dropping across all regions. Of 8300 deaths reported to the WHO last week, the United States by far reported the most, with about 2700.

At a WHO briefing today [5 Oct 2022], Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said several European countries are now reporting increased cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, which he said is expected as the weather cools and people spend more time together indoors without COVID measures in place.

"We expect reported cases of COVID-19 to increase. But the deaths don't have to, given we have vaccines and therapeutics that can save lives," he said, urging countries to step up surveillance, testing, sequencing, and ensuring that high-risk groups are vaccinated.

Tedros said the WHO and its partners are tracking more than 300 omicron subvariants.

[WHO global COVID situation update 5 Oct 2022 (https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/weekly-epidemiological-update-on-covid-19---5-october-2022)

Globally, the number of new weekly cases decreased by 6% during the week of 26 Sep to 2 Oct 2022, as compared to the previous week, with over 2.9 million new cases reported. The number of new weekly deaths decreased by 12%, as compared to the previous week, with just over 8300 fatalities reported.

As of 2 Oct 2022, 615 million confirmed cases and 6.5 million deaths have been reported globally.

WHO DG Tedros briefing comments (5 Oct 2022) (https://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-5-october-2022):

Several countries in Europe are now reporting an increase in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths.

This is to be expected as the weather cools and people spend more time together inside, and most countries no longer have measures in place to limit the spread of the virus.

We expect reported cases of COVID-19 to increase. But the deaths don't have to, given we have vaccines and therapeutics that can save lives.

Omicron remains the dominant variant globally, and WHO and our partners are tracking more than 300 sub-variants. But surveillance, testing and sequencing remain weak globally, which makes tracking this virus like chasing shadows.

So we continue to call on all countries to increase surveillance, testing and sequencing, and to ensure the most at-risk groups are vaccinated. ...]

SARS-CoV-2 omicron BA.4/BA.5 infection milder than delta in South Africa
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A South African study shows that COVID-19 patients infected with omicron BA.4/BA.5 subvariants were at similar risk for severe disease and hospitalization as patients infected with the BA.1 (original omicron) variant but less so than those infected with the delta variant.

In the study, published yesterday [4 Oct 2022] in Nature Communications, researchers from the National Health Laboratory Service in Johannesburg compared rates of severe illness and hospitalization in the country from 1 Oct 2021 to 26 Apr 2022. Median age of patients infected with a known strain was 37 years, and 55.7% were female.

Overall, 884 379 COVID-19 cases were diagnosed, of which 98 710 were likely caused by delta (1.3%), BA.1 (76.6%), BA.2 (20.3%), or BA.4/BA.5 (1.8%). A total of 13.5% of delta patients were hospitalized, compared with 4.0% of those infected with BA.1, 3.3% with BA.2, and 4.8% with BA.4/BA.5. Omicron reinfections were more common than those caused by delta (9.7% for BA.1, 9.3% for BA.2, 11.7% for BA.4/BA.5, and 2.9% for delta).

After controlling for potential confounding factors, BA.4/BA.5 patients had comparable odds of severe illness (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41 to 1.26) and hospitalization (aOR, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.98 to 1.55) as BA.1-infected patients but lower odds than with delta.

In addition to geographic factors, risk factors for hospitalization included young age (less than 5 years, aOR 7.09), older age (40 to 59 years, aOR 1.36; 60 years and older, aOR 4.77) and female sex (aOR, 1.09).

Among hospitalized patients with a known outcome, 33.4% were severely ill overall: 57.7% of delta patients, 33.7% with BA.1, 26.2%, with BA.2, and 27.5% with BA.4/BA.5. A multivariable analysis showed that, compared with BA.1, the odds of severe disease were higher only for delta (aOR, 2.47).

"As the prevalence of cases due to BA.4/BA.5 lineages increase in other countries, this data may be useful for healthcare resource planning; however, our findings may not be fully extrapolated to other settings with different immune landscapes such as those with a higher proportion of immunity due to vaccination and not previous infection," the researchers wrote.
