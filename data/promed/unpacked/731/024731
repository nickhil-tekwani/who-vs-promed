[The map accompanying the OIE report depicts a fairly widespread outbreak, with cases ranging from Tunis to the middle of the country. It can also be seen on the ProMED HealthMap at the link below.

It is notable that there was an outbreak last March 2012 in adjacent Algeria, and we also report an outbreak in Egypt today (3 Aug 2012), see below. PPR continues to be a major challenge in the North African region, where sheep and goats are critically important. Efforts to control this outbreak should clearly be maximized given the stakes. - Mod.PC

[In addition to the Algerian outbreak last March 2012 referred to below, we have also reported on a serious outbreak in Tunisia above, which was published in this week's OIE WAHID Weekly Disease Information report. While the outbreak in Egypt is not quite as extensive as the one in Tunisia, it still causes concern, especially since this a serious disease in a regionally important species of livestock. - Mod.PC
