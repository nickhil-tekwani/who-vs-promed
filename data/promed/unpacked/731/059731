The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control [ECDC] reported 12 new cases of West Nile fever in the week ending on Thursday [15 Aug 2013] in the countries of the European Union.

West Nile fever is an illness caused by the mosquito-borne West Nile virus. Of the new cases, 9 occurred in Greece, with 4 cases in Attiki, 2 in Kavala, 2 in Xanthi and one in Thessaloniki. Hungary reported its 1st case in Pest county and Romania reported its 1st confirmed case in Galati county. Pest county was affected by West Nile fever in 2012, while Galati county was affected in both 2011 and 2010.

Austria reported a confirmed case of West Nile fever infection, but the case is still under investigation.

There were 44 new cases of West Nile fever reported in the week ending on Thursday [15 Aug 2013] in neighboring countries. The Russian Federation reported 26 cases. Of these cases, 10 were from areas with previous case reports: Saratov oblast with 4, Astrakhan oblast with 3 and Volgograd oblast with 3. Of the cases, 16 were from newly affected areas, including 8 in the Samarskaya oblast, 4 in the Rostovskaya oblast, 2 from the Lipetskaya oblast, one from the Voronezhskaya oblast and one from the Adygeya republic.

Serbia reported 10 new cases, including 7 cases in Grad Beograd, and one case each in the Sremski district, Podunavski district and Macva district. Israel reported 8 new cases, including 4 in the Central district, 2 in Haifa and 2 in Tel Aviv.

The ECDC's West Nile fever maps report the geographic distribution of reported human West Nile fever cases in the EU and neighboring countries. The information is meant to help authorities responsible for blood safety in areas with ongoing West Nile virus transmission to support the implementation of legislation for blood safety.

[This has been an active West Nile virus (WNV) transmission season so far this year (2013). With 2-3 months of WNV transmission remaining in most of these countries, more cases can be expected. Presumably, health authorities in the affected countries are advising citizens to avoid mosquito bites. No mention is made of equine cases in the above report, but it would not be surprising if some have occurred.
