More than 120 HFRS cases this year [2009] in the Penza Region [Oblast]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Physicians in the Penza region have been combating hemorrhagic fever
with renal syndrome (HFRS), but as of today [13 May 2009] the
situation has deteriorated.

Warm winters and human mismanagement have thwarted efforts to improve
the situation.

Alexander Dmitriev, head of Territorial Management of Rospotrebnadzor
[Federal Service for Consumer Affairs and Human Welfare] stated that
HFRS, leptospirosis, and tularemia, are directly connected with the
existence of refuse dumps. Last year [2008] 350 HFRS cases were
recorded whereas there have already been 122 such cases this year [2009].

The main sources of infection among rural inhabitants are spontaneous
refuse dumps, whereas elsewhere risk of infection is associated with
a high density of country cottages -- where rodents live and breed --
occupied mainly for holidays and recreational activities. Kaysar
Gayfullin, an infectious diseases specialist advised that it was
necessary to carry out wet cleaning and to wear a mask to avoid
exposure to dust during the initial cleaning of such properties in
spring and summer.

[The Penza region was established in 1939. It belongs to the Russian
Federation and is situated on the East European plain, south east of
Moscow. It is in a temperate zone. There are diverse nature
conditions in the region: forests cover about half of its north east
territory, while the south west of the region is the typical Russian
steppe. The average temperature of the air is +18.5 deg C [65.3 deg
F] in the summer, and -11 deg C [12.2 deg F] in the winter.
