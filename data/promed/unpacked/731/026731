In regards to the moderator's comment on ProMED-mail post
20100228.0667 [post exposure prophylaxis -- a series of shots given
over about 2 months time in a muscle mass. - Mod.TG]

The statement above needs clarification. With current vaccines, a
person exposed to rabies but never previously vaccinated against
rabies receives 4 doses of rabies vaccine -- one dose immediately,
and subsequent doses on the 3rd, 7th, and 14th days. They should also
be given rabies immune globulin with the initial dose.

A person who is fully immunised only requires 2 doses of rabies
vaccine -- one immediately and the 2nd on the 3rd day -- and in this
situation rabies immunoglobulin is not required.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. Ellam for the above
clarification. The current guidelines/recommendations for
postexposure treatment in the USA are presented in the ACIP Provision
Recommendations from 24 Jun 2009, and call for 4 doses of vaccine on
the same schedule as mentioned by Dr. Ellam. Prior to this, the USA
recommendation included a 5th dose at 28 days following
exposure. The recommendations stress the importance of completing
the vaccination as soon as possible following the recommended schedule.

ACIP Provisional Recommendations for the Prevention of Human Rabies

Date of ACIP meeting and vote: 24 Jun 2009
Date of posting of provisional recommendations: 10 Jul 2009

On 24 Jun 2009, the ACIP approved new recommendations on the use of
rabies vaccine for post-exposure prophylaxis for the prevention of
human rabies. A summary of the new provisional recommendations for
the use of rabies vaccine follows:

Post-exposure prophylaxis for unvaccinated persons
--------------------------------------------------
Vaccine use
-----------
A regimen of 4 1-mL vaccine doses of rabies vaccine (HDCV or PCECV)
should be administered intramuscularly to previously unvaccinated
persons with no immunosuppression. The 1st dose of the 4-dose course
should be administered as soon as possible after exposure. This date
is considered day 0 of the post-exposure prophylaxis series.
Additional doses should then be administered on days 3, 7, and 14
after the 1st vaccination. Considerations for the site of the
intramuscular vaccination remain unchanged.

Rabies immune globulin use
--------------------------
The recommendations for use of immune globulin remain unchanged.

Post-exposure prophylaxis for previously vaccinated persons
-----------------------------------------------------------
The recommendations for the post-exposure management of previously
vaccinated individuals remain unchanged.

Post-vaccination serologic testing
----------------------------------
No testing of healthy patients completing prophylaxis is necessary to
document seroconversion, unless the person is immunosuppressed. When
titers are obtained, specimens collected from 1 to 2 weeks after
prophylaxis should completely neutralize challenge virus at a 1:5
serum dilution by the rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT).

Precautions
-----------
Immunosuppression:
Immunosuppression results from a wide variety of conditions. Primary
or secondary immunodeficiencies may significantly reduce immune
responses to vaccines. Given the large variety of immunocompromising
conditions, as well as subsequent alterations in degrees of
clinically significant immunodeficiencies, the evaluation of a
potentially immunocompromised patient, as well as the decision about
proper immunization of the immunocompromised patient, ultimately lies
with the attending physician.

All rabies vaccines licensed in the US are inactivated cell culture
vaccines and as such can be administered safely to persons with
altered immunocompetence. The effectiveness of such vaccinations and
quality of elicited immune responses in immunocompromised patients
could be suboptimal. Extensive monitoring of the immune response
after rabies vaccination, specifically the determination of rabies
virus-neutralizing antibodies, should be performed.

For persons with broadly defined immunosuppression, post-exposure
prophylaxis should be administered using all 5 doses of vaccine, with
the awareness that the immune response may still be inadequate. When
administered to an immunosuppressed person, one or more serum samples
should be tested for rabies virus neutralizing antibody by the RFFIT
to ensure that an acceptable antibody response has developed after
completing the series. A patient who fails to seroconvert with an
acceptable antibody response after the 5th and last dose should be
managed in consultation with their physician and appropriate public
health officials.

The 2008 ACIP recommendations for the prevention of human rabies are
otherwise unchanged, and are available at
