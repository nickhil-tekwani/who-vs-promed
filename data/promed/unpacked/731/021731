The conventional explanation for why the pandemic struck the 20-40 year old
age group has been that World War I was in full force, and the density of
living quarters were ideal for transmission among soldiers--people in
this age group. However, this is not completely satisfactory, since it
also struck people in this age group who were not in the military. Another
explanation is that there was a pandemic in 1889 that is putatively thought
to have been the same strain as 1918-19. However, that would not explain
the attack rates in people over 30. It remains a mystery. The most
accessible work on this is Alfred Crosby's book [Dr. Mayer didn't have the
exact reference available at the moment, but it should be easy to find

You might keep in mind in regard to the elderly being left out and the
young adults over-represented [during the 1918 influenza pandemic, that
this is exactly the pattern that would be expected if there had been a
previous pandemic (overt or covert) of a related influenza virus, say
25-30 years before, that had provided cross protection, or even of a more
closely related flu virus (i.e. the same virus coming round again).
With the development and expansive use of railways and fast steam-driven
ships, the extent of long-distance travel had rocketed in the decades prior
to 1918. Therefore late 19th Century pandemics of flu cannot be ruled out.
