The semi-official Press Trust of India reported on [Sun 20 Sep 2009]
that 11 children have died of Japanese encephalitis in past 2 days,
bringing the toll to the epidemic in Gorakhpur district of Uttar
Pradesh, northern India, to 311 so far this year [2009].

A total of 1521 patients suffering from Japanese encephalitis and acute
encephalitis syndrome have been admitted to hospital this year [2009],
and 311 of them have died, said the report.

The deadly Japanese encephalitis fever is caused by a virus found in
pigs [and wild birds - Mod.TY] and is transferred to humans by mosquito
bite.

[The etiology of the encephalitis outbreak in this area remains
confusing, but the number of cases continues to increase. The report
above implies Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is responsible for
these cases, but a recent report (ProMED-mail archive no.
20090827.3015) indicated that less than half were due to JEV and the
remaining to "acute encephalitis syndrome" of unidentified etiology. It
would be of interest to know how many of the cases in the report above
were laboratory confirmed.
