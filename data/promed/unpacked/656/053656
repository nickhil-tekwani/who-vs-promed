A total of 6 people died and more than 90 fell
ill after eating endangered turtles in
Micronesia, the Pacific nation's government said
Friday [12 Nov 2010].

The deaths, which included 4 children, occurred
after a feast on the island of Murilo [Chuuk
State] in mid-October [2010] where the rare
hawksbill turtle was consumed, the Federated
States of Micronesia's public information office
said.

It said government health officials and the World
Health Organization found the deaths were a
result of chelonitoxism, a type of poisoning
caused by biotoxins in turtle flesh for which
there is no known antidote. Hawksbill turtles
were a species known to cause chelonitoxism and
children were particularly vulnerable to the
condition, the government said in a statement.

It said health authorities had recommended a
complete ban on eating turtles and their eggs as
a result of the deaths.

"Though this incident has come to an end, future
incidents are certain to occur unless action is
taken to alter turtle-eating behavior," the
statement said.

The hawksbill turtle was the original source of
tortoiseshell and is protected under the
Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species (CITES).

[Chelonitoxism is an uncommon type of food
poisoning caused by eating the flesh of marine
turtles (Brodin, 1992). In the literature 2
species have been clearly implicated in sea
turtle poisoning, that is, the hawksbill turtle
(_Eretmochelys imbricata_) and the green sea
turtle (_Chelonia mydas_). However, other species
may be toxic including the leatherback turtle
(_Dermochelys coriacea_) and the loggerhead
turtle (_Caretta caretta_). Sea turtle poisoning
is a severe intoxication with a high mortality
rate. It is mainly observed in the Indo-Pacific
region but has also been reported in the
intertropical zone where the offending species
live.

The low frequency of chelonitoxism is probably
related to the fact that sea turtles are an
endangered species protected by international
regulations and subject to a number of religious
restrictions (taboo species for many ethnic
groups) (Champetier de Ribes et al, 1998).
Nevertheless episodes of turtle poisoning have
been reported among low-income coastal
populations for whom a captured sea turtle can
represent a non-negligible source of sustenance.

Another reason for the paucity of reliable data
on sea turtle poisoning is that victims often
live in remote geographical locations with no
access to health care facilities (Pillai et al,
1962; Ranaivoson et al, 1994; Champetier de Ribes
et al, 1997; Robinson et al, 1999). It should
also be noted that consumption of sea turtles is
illegal and the fear of sanctions may keep some
victims from seeking medical attention. The
clinical signs of chelonitoxism are clearly
distinguishable from other types of seafood
poisonings (Brodin, 1992; Isbister and Kiernan,
2005) and are relatively stereotyped.

Onset occurs from few hours to 4 days after
consumption. The onset period is characterized by
the appearance of gastrointestinal signs (nausea,
vomiting, epigastric pain and, occasionally,
diarrhea). Other symptoms possibly present at
onset include dizziness, malaise, sweating, sore
throat, and chest pain. Most patients do not
develop any further effects and recover over a
week (Bagnis and Bourligueux, 1972).

The typical moderate poisoning is characterized
by pathognomonic oral and pharyngeal involvement
with a burning mouth and throat sensation and
dysphagia with hypersialorrhea followed by
glossitis (25-75 percent of patients depending on
series). Ulcerative oeso-gastro-duodenal lesions
have also been reported. At this stage
neurological manifestations, best indicators of
severity, may appear with alternating periods of
drowsiness and full consciousness (or psychomotor
agitation). Most patients with moderate forms
(grade 2) recover fully within about 3 weeks.
However some patients may lapse into coma as an
initial phase of a more severe grade
characterized by multiorgan involvement (tubular
nephropathy, liver cytolysis, hypotonic coma,
respiratory distress). The most frequent abnormal
laboratory test findings are metabolic acidosis,
hyperuricemia, hyponatremia, hypocalcemia,
hypoglycemia, neutropenia, and thrombopenia
(Brodin, 1992). Mortality is high among patients
with severe forms especially in children. Upon
emerging from coma, survivors often present
complex central and/or peripheral neurological
sequels (such as, hemiplegia, tetraplegia,
dementia, sensorimotor deficit, cerebellar
syndrome). There is no antidote for sea turtle
poisoning and treatment is strictly supportive
and symptomatic with intensive care if necessary.

The sea turtle species most commonly cited in the
literature and apparently responsible of the
highest mortality is _E. imbricata_. Most authors
stress that all organs of this chelonian are
potentially toxic regardless of preparation
(thermoresistant toxin ?) (Pillai et al, 1962;
Ariyananda and Fernando, 1987; Champetier de
Ribes et al, 1999). It has also been noted that
toxic effects are dose dependent since symptoms
are most severe in victims that eat the most
flesh. Another feature of chelonitoxism described
in the literature is passage of toxins into
breast milk with several reported cases of
poisoning in breast-fed children that did not
consume the turtle flesh itself (Dewdney, 1967;
Ariyananda and Fernando, 1987; Ranaivoson et al,
1994). Transplacental contamination may have also
occurred in a case in which the fetus died at the
beginning of the severe phase when the metabolic
status of the mother was still under control.

It should be stressed that the causative toxins
for sea turtle poisoning have not been
identified. The symptoms and outcomes are known,
but toxin remains a mystery.

[Another article adds: "The toxic compounds
identified to date as the causative agents are
lyngbyatoxins, which are accumulated through the
food chain into the flesh of marine turtles
following ingestion of the cyanobacterium Lyngbya
majuscula, that grows on seagrass, sand and rocky
outcrops." (Magnino S, Colin P, Dei-Cas E, Madsen
