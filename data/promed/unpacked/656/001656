Over 500 acres of maize and 14 of cassava in Serere district [Eastern Region] have been affected by a strange disease. Affected farmers said the disease eats the crops' tubers making them rot and unsuitable for human consumption. The disease has affected their only source of income.

The area parish councillor asked authorities to dispatch a team of agricultural experts to ascertain the disease which has caused havoc on their crops. "We are going to engage the agriculture officers to curb this problem," [he] noted.

[From this report, it is not possible to speculate on the diseases or disorders referred to. Maize as a monocotyledon and cassava as a dicotyledon are entirely unrelated species. While there are some fungal and bacterial pathogens that have a wide host range, it is more likely that more than one crop disease is affecting the area.

A range of pathogens, including fungi, bacteria, viruses and nematodes, have been reported to affect these crops in Africa. In particular, the viral diseases of lethal necrosis of maize, as well as mosaic and brown streak of cassava are spreading in the region (for more information see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives). Reliable diagnosis of the cause(s) is essential before any management strategies can be designed.
