Usually the course of Aujeszky disease in cattle is very short 2 or 3 days
and the description of the case of Sarradet is more than 2 weeks (first
symptoms seen by Sarradet at the end of November, with decision for
slaughter on the 16th of December).
Scrapie was very well known by this veterinarian and I remember, when I made
the first videotape for a description of BSE for French veterinarians in
1990 (with the description of 5 cases of BSE in a videotape given [to us by
MAFF) I was very surprised by the similarities of clinical signs of scrapie
(I was working on natural scrapie in sheep at the veterinary school of
Alfort with Jacqueline Chatelain and Jean-Louis Laplanche, hopital St-Louis)
with the clinical signs of BSE. For this reason, I have presented also two
cases of scrapie in the French videotape on BSE; this videotape was utilized
for the official surveillance of BSE in France.
Without confirmation by the histology we cannot be sure of the diagnosis of
Sarradet but we cannot exclude the hypothesis of a "cas de tremblante chez
un boeuf"

[Clearly, there is a difference in veterinarians' experiences of the usual
course of this disease in cattle today compared to Sarradet's description of
his cow a hundred years ago, but it may be within the described period. Is
there any published data on the normal duration distribution of Aujeszky's
disease in cattle? It is also possible that Aujeszky's affected cows today
are diagnosed more quickly and killed promptly for humanitarian reasons. -
