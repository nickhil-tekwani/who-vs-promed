Following the recent ProMED alert: "Guillain-Barre syndrome - Portugal: hepatitis E virus, genotype 3, archive number 20130824.1898358," we would like to bring attention to our recently published study: "Hepatitis E and Guillain Barre syndrome (GBS) in Bangladesh," [see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23899686].

Serological data from our case controlled study in Bangladesh support the proposed association between hepatitis E virus infection and Guillain-Barre syndrome.

Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is a disorder in which the body's immune system attacks part of the peripheral nervous system. The 1st symptoms of this disorder include varying degrees of weakness or tingling sensations in the legs. In many instances, the symmetrical weakness and abnormal sensations spread to the arms and upper body. These symptoms can increase in intensity until certain muscles cannot be used at all, and, when severe, the person is almost totally paralyzed. In these cases, the disorder is life threatening -- potentially interfering with breathing and, at times, with blood pressure or heart rate -- and is considered a medical emergency. Such an individual is often put on a ventilator to assist with breathing and is watched closely for problems such as an abnormal heart beat, infections, blood clots, and high or low blood pressure. Most individuals, however, recover from even the most severe cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome, although some continue to have a certain degree of weakness.

Guillain-Barre syndrome can affect anybody. It can strike at any age, and both sexes are equally prone to the disorder. The syndrome is rare, however, afflicting only about one person in 100 000. Usually Guillain-Barre occurs a few days or weeks after the patient has had symptoms of a respiratory or gastrointestinal viral infection. Occasionally, surgery will trigger the syndrome. In rare instances, vaccinations may increase the risk of GBS. After the 1st clinical manifestations of the disease, the symptoms can progress over the course of hours, days, or weeks. Most people reach the stage of greatest weakness within the 1st 2 weeks after symptoms appear, and by the 3rd week of the illness, 90 percent of all patients are at their weakest.

Guillain-Barre -- which is not contagious -- strikes some people and not others. It is not known what induces the condition or why there may be an association between hepatitis E virus infection and GBS. When GBS is preceded by a viral or bacterial infection, it is possible that the virus has changed the nature of cells in the nervous system so that the immune system treats them as foreign cells. It is also possible that the virus makes the immune system itself less discriminating about what cells it recognizes as its own, allowing some of the immune cells, such as certain kinds of lymphocytes and macrophages, to attack the myelin. Sensitized T lymphocytes cooperate with B lymphocytes to produce antibodies against components of the myelin sheath and may contribute to destruction of the myelin.

In 2 forms of GBS, axons are attacked by antibodies against the bacteria _Campylobacter jejuni_, which react with proteins of the peripheral nerves. Acute motor axonal neuropathy is particularly common in Chinese children. Scientists are investigating these and other possibilities to find out why the immune system goes awry in Guillain-Barre syndrome and other autoimmune diseases. The cause and course of Guillain-Barre syndrome is an active area of neurological investigation, incorporating the cooperative efforts of neurological scientists, immunologists, and virologists.

It remains to be established whether hepatitis E virus infection is more likely to precipitate this type of reaction. What is known is that that the body's immune system begins to attack the body itself, causing what is known as an autoimmune disease. Usually, the cells of the immune system attack only foreign material and invading organisms. In Guillain-Barre syndrome, however, the immune system starts to destroy the myelin sheath that surrounds the axons of many peripheral nerves, or even the axons themselves (axons are long, thin extensions of the nerve cells; they carry nerve signals). The myelin sheath surrounding the axon speeds up the transmission of nerve signals and allows the transmission of signals over long distances.
