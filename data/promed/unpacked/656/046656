RABIES VACCINE, REACTIONS - BRAZIL (SAO PAULO): REQUEST FOR INFO
****************************************************************
A ProMED-mail post
<http://www.healthnet.org/programs/promed.html>

From: Dr. Oscar P. Larghi <oplarghi@drwebsa.com.ar>

Over one year ago, post-vaccinal reactions (PVR) due to suckling mouse
brain rabies vaccine (SMBRV) from Brazil, were posted on ProMED-mail.
Last week, at the 10th Annual Rabies in the Americas Meeting in San Diego,
CA, a poster (Panachao MRI et al.) reported on the occurrence of around 20
cases of PVR among 67 000 persons treated with SMBRV in Sao Paulo in 1997,
including 7 cases of Guillain Barre syndrome and one death. [GB syndrome is
a progressive ascending paralysis which is often reversible - Mod.JW]
This ratio of PVR/PET resembles that of vaccines prepared with adult animal
brain. When SMBRV is prepared correctly, a ratio of [only] 1/20 000-1/80
000 may be encountered.
Considering that PVRs have not been reported lately in the Epidemiological
Surveillance of Rabies in the Americas, PAHO/WHO INPPAZ, and to clarify
whether this is a local outbreak or a generalized situation, I hereby
request colleagues from Latin American countries where SMBRV is used, to
report whether they have seen this type of reaction.
