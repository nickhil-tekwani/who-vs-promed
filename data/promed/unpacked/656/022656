One reference from the Bernhard Nocht-Institute in Hamburg (that did the
diagnostic procedures in the recent imported case in Germany) is:
Ter Meulen et al. (1996) Am J Trop Med Hyg 55:661-6, "Hunting of
peridomestic rodents and consumption of their meat as possible risk factors
for rodent-to-human transmission of Lassa virus in the Republic of Guinea"
"In this population-based study, we correlated possible risk factors for
rodent-to-human transmission of Lassa virus with markers of Lassa fever in
two different regions of the Republic of Guinea (Prefectures of Pita and
Gueckedou). Antibody prevalence was 2.6% (6 of 232) in Pita compared with
14.0% (105 of 751) in Gueckedou, with up to 35.0% seropositivity in
selected villages of the higher prevalence area. We observed three major
risk factors in Gueckedou favoring Lassa virus transmission: rodent
infestation was much higher, food was more often stored uncovered and most
strikingly, peridomestic rodents were hunted as a protein source by 91.5%
of the population as opposed to 0% in Pita. To control for the confounding
effects of differences in rodent infestation and food storage, rodent
consumption was analyzed as a risk factor for transmission of Lassa virus
comparing rodent consumers (RC) and non consumers (NC) in Gueckedou only:
14.6% of RC had Lassa virus antibodies versus 7.4% of NC (P = 0.1) and
23.0% of RC reported a history of a febrile illness with hearing loss (the
most common sequel of Lassa fever) versus 6.1% of NC (P = 0.003)."

There were quite a number of serological studies on Lassa fever starting
back in the early 1970s (e.g. Henderson et al Trans of Royal Society of
Trop Med & Hygiene 66:409-416). Moren & McCormick et al reported on work in
the late 1970s & The March '87 issue of J of Inf Diseases published several
articles. Pretty well all of these show up on Medline. I have a grad
student currently (James Valcour - jvalcour@ovc.uoguelph.ca) doing some
work on this & he says he would be willing to share what he's picked up in
a Pro-cyte format. But I confess that if Mr. House was my grad student, I'd
send him back for another search...

In response to the request for citations regarding seroepidemiologic
studies for Lassa fever:
There are numerous, a few of which are below. A few caveats should be
mentioned. Most older studies were done using IFA or CF antibodies, which
probably don't last as long as those detected by ELISA. Thus, the
prevalence of exposure may be underestimated in those studies. On the
other hand, they are also less specific than ELISA antibody.
Sometimes there are serologic data but without clinical histories to know
whether the person had a "Lassa-like" illness, so the prevalence of
clinical disease cannot be calculated. There is also the problem of the
clinical presentation. That of the German student represents the fulminant
and most distinct form of the disease which is seen in a minority of cases.
More often, Lassa presents in a very non-distinct way, which can easily be
mistaken for malaria or typhoid which virtually everyone in West Africa has
had. Thus, not remembering a "Lassa-like" illness does not mean they
didn't have clinical disease.
Lassa transmission and clinical disease are clearly documented in Nigeria,
Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. Although not documented from Cote
d'Ivoire or Ghana, where this latest case was presumably exposed, this
probably represents an absence of surveillance and laboratory capacity
rather than an absence of disease. Certainly the distribution of Lassa in
West Africa is "patchy," with a range of clinical presentations and
severity, but it's certainly there in numerous "pockets," many of which
remain to be uncovered. And certainly, as this case represents, it has the
potential to be a very severe disease. I think the often-quoted
case-fatality rate of about 20% in cases coming to medical attention is
probably accurate.

The following information, while not necessarily providing seroprevalence
data, may at least provide some pertinent information on the epidemiology
of Lassa fever.
Lassa fever, caused by an arenavirus, is named after the Nigerian village
of Lassa. It was first brought to Western attention in 1969 when American
nurses became ill while helping patients involved in a local disease
outbreak. Lassa virus is now recognized to be a significant cause of
illness and death among African people. It infects as many as 100 000 to
300 000 people in the West African region each year, resulting in an
estimated 5000 deaths annually (McCormick et al., 1987).

My initial search included a limiter for seroprevalence and came up with
nothing, as I said. So I just now bit the bullet and waded through
everything NLM returned against only "Lassa Fever". Out of 194 cites,
about 11 look relevant for Lassa seroepidemiology. With the abstracts, it
comes to about 9KB, which I would be happy to forward to anyone interested.
