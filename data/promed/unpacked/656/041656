Health officials find dead animals infected with the plague
-------------------------------------
Local health officials have found evidence that the plague and tularemia
have been found in dead animals and pets and are alerting the public to use
preventative measures to avoid the diseases.
2 pet cats have been diagnosed with the plague [caused by the
bacterium _Yersinia pestis_] in the past 2 weeks, and a woman died from
the plague while visiting the Red Feather Lakes area in August 2004.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have jointly been working
with the Larimer County Department of Health and Environment in monitoring
the plague and other infectious diseases.
"Plague has always been endemic to this area," said LeeAnn Kempton, an
environmental specialist at the health and environment department.
So far, 4 feline plague cases have been reported this year. In 1999, a
woman died from the plague in the same area that this year's human case
occurred.
Ann Watson, public information specialist with the health and environment
department, said it is rare to find humans infected with the plague and
said those people that are infected come from contact with their pets.
"Most of our human cases come from cats. We have had so few cases it is
hard to make generalizations," Watson said.
Cats and other animals can be infected with the plague when they kill and
eat infected rodents that are riddled with infected fleas. From that point,
pets can transmit the disease to humans through bites, scratches or
droplets from their coughs. The bacteria can also be transmitted via the
infected fleas themselves, which pets can also bring into domesticated areas.
Bubonic plague, the more common form of the plague, occurs when extreme
pain and swelling of the lymph nodes strikes a victim. The groin and armpit
region are the most common fleabite locations in humans, according to a
press release from the health and environment department. The bubonic
plague is not transmitted person-to-person, but it can spread to the lungs
to form pneumonic plague, and the victim's close contacts can be infected.
Though the plague may be rare in humans, rodent populations carry it often,
such as in mice or rats, Kempton said.
Recently, another bacterium, [_Francisella tularensis, the cause of ]
tularemia, has been traced in Larimer County in a dead beaver and mouse. A
man from Loveland was struck with pneumonia caused by tularemia in August.
Tularemia is another rare occurrence in Larimer County and infects humans
who handle infected animals such as rodents or rabbits or humans who are
bit by infected insects, especially ticks and deer flies. Tularemia is a
bacterial disease that can affect humans or animals from insects that have
the disease.
Health officials say to take precautions to prevent infections from these
diseases. Using insect repellents, avoiding sick or dead rodents, keeping
pets leashed while camping or hiking, and keeping close attention to a
pet's health are all preventative measures.
Adrienne LeBaily, the county's heath department director, said, "Although
these bacteria are potential bioterror agents, we are convinced that these
human cases were naturally occurring."

[Prairie dogs are often considered the most sensitive sentinel to plague.
Generally monitoring prairie dog activity can give one a clue as to when
the rodent cycle of plague may be spilling over into other
populations. Cats may be one of our most sensitive domestic sentinels.
Plague generally has 2 forms: pneumonic and bubonic. Pneumonic form can
spread between people if the contact is relatively close.
While fleas carry plague, ticks carry tularemia.
Tularemia may be acquired from ticks, or from handling an infected carcass,
from inhalation of the bacteria, and from consumption of contaminated food
or water. Tularemia is not known to spread from person to person.
Both of these bacterial diseases can be treated, in pets as well as in
human beings. - Mod.TG]
