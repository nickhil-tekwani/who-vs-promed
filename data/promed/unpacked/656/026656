STREPTOCOCCAL ILNESS DUE TO JERBOAS - EGYPT/USA (2)
===================================================
This posting from the 44th Ann. Meeting of the American Society of Tropical
Medicine & Hygiene (ProMed v.96.n021) also points to another interesting
line of thought with regards to the importation of exotic animals. In
addition to depleting the animal in question in its natural habit (collecting
practices in many countries are often without any regard for allowing a
sustainable population of the species), if the species being collected is
predatory (as in the case of the "jerboas") the normal prey of this predator
can often increase exponentially and cause disease outbreaks, crop damage etc.
Another good reason for encouraging the purchase of captive-bred exotic
animals from a reputable breeder/pet store: to mitigate the occurrence of
imported disease outbreaks as well as maintain the wild populations.

[- According to volume 11 of Grzimek's Animal Life Encyclopedia (403-406pp)
the jerboas diet is largely plants and seeds, occasionally suplemented by
insects and beetles. They are especially keen on onions. However the
literature is rife with accounts of imported diseases, infections, and
ectoparasites via the commerce in wild animals. Eg, in the 1970s there were
panzootic outbreaks of Newcastle disease in commercial and backyard poultry
flocks associated with imported parrots. While the care of birds in transit
is improving, losses are still very high which must affect their risk
potential. MH-J ProMED-AHEAD MOderator.]
