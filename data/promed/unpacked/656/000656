Yesterday 3 serum samples were reported positive for yellow fever IgM
antibodies by Christian Mathiot, IP Dakar. The MoH and WHO Guinea
are arranging for YF vaccination in the affected region.
This outbreak of a febrile jaundice in Mamou district, Republic of
Guinea, was investigated by a joint team of the Ministry of Health
(MoH), Guinea, and the "Projet de Recherche sur les Fievres
Hemorragiques en Guinee" (PFHG), Conakry, Guinea. Barrier nursing
measures were implemented in the regional hospital of Mamou, and
contacts of patients were investigated.
Serum samples are being analysed by the PFHG in Conakry, the Pasteur
Institute Dakar, Senegal, the Pasteur Institute Paris, France, and the
Institute of Virology, Marburg, Germany.

GIDEON <http://www.cyinfo.com> tells me that Guinea lies within the
yellow fever "Endemic Zone," and that one case was reported in 1952
and none during 1953 to 1986.
The last cases (5) were reported in 1987.
Potential for infection exists in the Siguiri region. Proof of vaccination
IS required for travelers over 1 year of age arriving from infected areas.
