Several boxes of smuggled poultry products have gone missing from a
Michigan warehouse amid government surveillance activities to prevent
illegal imports from countries known to have suffered outbreaks of highly
pathogenic bird flu, a U.S. Department of Agriculture spokesman said.
After the discovery and destruction of about 2000 pounds of poultry
products smuggled into Troy, Mich., from China -- a country battling the
deadly H5N1 form of bird flu -- in early June, USDA officials were called
back by Michigan authorities later that month. On 27 Jun 2006, USDA
spokesman Ed Loyd said, federal and state officials detained 150 pounds of
smuggled poultry and pig carcasses. The next week, when USDA returned to
the location in Genesee County, 4 boxes of smuggled goose intestines had
disappeared and been replaced with "chicken parts." Loyd said, "An
investigation is being conducted into the criminal violation related to the
goose intestines."
Ron DeHaven, administrator of USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service, said earlier in 2006 the government is increasing its inspection
of imports coming from countries that are banned from shipping birds and
poultry products to the U.S. "What's important is it only takes one
smuggled shipment that contains the (H5N1) virus to have catastrophic
consequences," DeHaven said.
USDA's Loyd said it is standard practice for the government to destroy the
smuggled poultry products it seizes without testing for bird flu. "Sample
testing of seized product would not provide food safety assurance, because
a single shipment often contains products from multiple sources and
therefore different levels of potential exposure to pathogens," he said.
Poultry, when properly cooked, is safe to eat, according to USDA. "Cooking
to an internal temperature of 165 degrees (Fahrenheit) kills all bacteria
and viruses."

[It seems to be a fact of life that the customs agencies work independently
of the health and veterinary services. Thus the latter are unintentionally
kept in the dark over which pathogens are coming in illegally from
wherever. One must accept that only a fraction of illegally imported meats
are intercepted. In spite of the sampling problems it would be valuable to
know what is coming in over the transom. The same inter-agency
non-collaboration blocking situation occurs in the UK and I am sure in many
other countries. - Mod.MHJ]
[Smuggling of meat, animal products and even animals themselves has always
been and continues to be an important issue. In the United States, Exotic
Newcastle Disease was brought into California in 1971 by the unrestricted
movement of pet birds into the country causing a major outbreak resulting
in multimillions dollar loss. Even when restrictions were subsequently
introduced, outbreaks due to smuggled pet birds continued to occur
periodically. African Swine Fever in Belgium in 1985 was associated with
someone illegally bringing infected meat from Spain and feeding it to a
boar. Smuggling of meat into the United Kingdom was often touted as the
cause of the devastating FMD outbreak in 2001. Finally, in the 2005 Taiwan
incident H5N1 virus was actually identified in smuggled meat.
Moreover, we have had previous cases of illegal importing into the United
States. In February 2006, USDA alertly identified smuggled "jellyfish"
products that actually contained chicken feet. At the same time, Taiwan
found smuggled duck tongues. See reference below.
The chances of people becoming infected with H5N1 from smuggled imported
meat are extremely low as most people don't interact with frozen poultry in
ways that would expose them like live poultry has in Southeast Asia and
other places where people have died from H5N1. The extent in which the
illegal movement of contaminated poultry products has contributed to the
spread of global H5N1 in poultry populations is unknown but should not be
discounted in the United States or elsewhere. What is of particular
concern is that illegal meat like this may originate from infected or
exposed farms -- which is why it was smuggled in the first place. In any
case, the extensive efforts of USDA to thwart smuggling are important and
may very well need to augmented. The really unfortunate thing, over and
above the greed and illegality involved, is that smuggling just adds
another wrinkle that really shouldn't be there to the already complicated
epidemiology surrounding the global spread of the H5N1 virus. - Mod.PC]
