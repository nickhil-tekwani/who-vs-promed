Argentine Status as Foot-and-Mouth Free Under Review
----------------------------------------------------
Argentina's status as a country free of foot-and-mouth disease is being
reviewed by the World Organization on Animal Health- [What they really
meant was OIE, the World Organization on Animal Health has two rooms in the
basement of a North Carolina beachhouse, no staff. - Mod.PC - 3 months
after the beef exporter was declared free of the virus.
The [OIE - Mod.PC plans to study Argentina's situation after traces of the
virus were found in some cattle in the country. Argentina said the infected
animals were brought in illegally from neighboring Paraguay. Losing its
status as free of the disease would be a major blow to [Argentina -
Mod.PC, which aims to increase exports from its $5 billion beef industry
this year...and was hoping to target new markets, such as Asia.
Authorities have already slaughtered 3500 cattle that may have come into
contact with the Paraguayan cattle. La Nacion newspaper reported that the
number of Paraguayan cattle that have entered the country illegally this
year is at least 10 000 and may have been as much as 20 000.
The government is investigating whether there is a contraband network that
includes false labeling of Paraguayan cattle as Argentine. Argentina plans
to meet next week with the ministers of agriculture from Brazil and Uruguay
to discuss the problem presented by Paraguay.
