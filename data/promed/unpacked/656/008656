[ProMED and PRO/MBDS would like to thank Dr. Huu Dung for alerting us
to the OIE report on the PRRS outbreak in Viet Nam.
A good map with affected areas highlighted can be found at the above
given URL link for the WAHID report. - Mod. MPP]
[PRRS is a disease of great importance to the swine industry wherever
it occurs. We are therefore very pleased to see the excellent
communication efforts made by the Vietnamese animal health
authorities. It is important that all concerned with both regional
and global animal health be apprised of its spread. We also
appreciate the clarification of the exact locations where the disease
affected swine.
In case anyone wonders what PRO/MBDS signifies, it is a regional
ProMED-mail list similar to ProMED-PORT (Portuguese), ProMED-ESP
(Spanish) and ProMED-RUS (Russia and Newly Independent States. It has
been championed by Mod. MPP, and we can see the value by the
timeliness of these reports.
Similar efforts throughout the Middle East and regions of Africa
(West, East, South and North) would improve global alertness and
response to emerging diseases in humans, animals and plants. - Mod.PC]
