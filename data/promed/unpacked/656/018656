On Monday [5 May 2008], 3 more people died from Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), raising the death toll to 5 in the past week.

In Samsun province 2 people died from CCHF and another 4 with similar
symptoms have been in medical care since then [? 5 May 2008].

A 57-year old man was bitten by a tick 3 weeks ago and died at the
Ankara Education and Research Hospital. His family said they had
taken him to a hospital a few days after the tick bite, which
occurred in the garden of their home in the village of Kirecoca in
Corum province.

In the central Anatolian city of Sivas 6 children were placed under
observation on suspicion of CCHF.

People should be aware of tick bites and should never try to take out
the ticks that have stuck to their skin, said Davut Vecdi Ersoz,
medical superintendent of the Sivas State Hospital. The Health
Ministry also issued a statement warning people against tick bites.
In case of a tick bite the skin should be covered with the proper
medicine [antiseptic?]. The tick should be removed using tweezers
with great care and iodine should be applied to the bite. Health
Ministry officials said ticks should never be killed by hand.
Moreover, those people touched by any tick should be kept under
medical treatment for 10 days and go to the nearest hospital if they
have symptoms such as fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea,
officials from the Health Ministry said.

CCHF mainly affects animals. Ticks, which live on sheep and cattle,
can sometimes pass the virus to people. It is an Ebola-like [that is,
haemorrhagic] fever where patients can bleed to death if they are not
treated quickly. Those infected can transmit the virus through their
blood or saliva. The disease is endemic in parts of Africa, Asia, and
Europe. Health authorities said a warmer climate, which Turkey has
experienced in recent years, could mean a larger tick population that
could in turn infect more people with the disease.

[CCHF is caused by a an RNA virus with a tri-segmented genome
classified in the genus _Nairovirus_ of the family _Bunyaviridae_.
CCHF virus can be transmitted to humans directly by tick-bite, by
nosocomial spread in hospitals, or by blood-borne transmission during
the slaughter of domestic animals, and rarely via unpasteurised milk.

Cases arising by transmission from ticks are usually sporadic,
whereas clusters of cases can be indicative of blood-borne
transmission associated with the slaughter of animals (mainly sheep
which themselves do not exhibit signs of disease).
