An unfamiliar species of mosquito, _Aedes albopictus_ -- which can spread yellow fever, dengue fever, and Zika fever viruses -- has been spotted in Cyprus.

The deputy head of health services Herodotos Herodotou told the Cyprus Times that this was the 1st time the _Ae. albopictus_ been seen in on the island.

However, although the _Ae. albopictus_ feeds on a wide range of hosts and is known to be a significant biting nuisance, Herodotou said the public should not be alarmed, as there are no serious diseases on the island for the mosquito to transmit.

He added that on Monday [24 Oct 2022], meetings are scheduled with the competent services of the Municipality of Limassol to draw up an action plan to combat the appearance of _Ae. albopictus_ in the city.

[There is no indication in the report above about how _Aedes albopictus_ may have been introduced into Cyprus. However, it is present in several nearby countries.

It is interesting to note that the detection of _Ae. albopictus_ on Cyprus comes about a month after _Ae. aegypti_ was found there but at a different locale on the island.

As the report above notes, _Ae. albopictus_ feeds on a wide range of hosts, many of which are not susceptible to dengue, chikungunya, or Zika viruses although humans are. _Ae. aegypti is the main vector of these viruses and feeds almost exclusively on humans but _Ae. albopictus_ has been the vector in some outbreaks. Eliminating these mosquitoes from the island may be difficult.

A map showing the distribution of _Ae. albopictus_ in Europe as of March 2022 can be seen at https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/aedes-albopictus-current-known-distribution-march-2022. A series of maps showing the distribution of other invasive _Aedes_ mosquitoes in the Mediterranean basin is available at this same URL.

The map shows that _Ae albopictus_ is widely distributed around southern and southwestern Europe. - Mod.TY
