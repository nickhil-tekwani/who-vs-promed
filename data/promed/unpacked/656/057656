Each year malaria attacks >1 million people in Oromia National State, the
national health bureau disclosed. Dr. Ibrahim Adem, head of the bureau,
in a speech at the Malaria Week event said the disease attacks the lowlanders
in the region also affects the economy. According to Dr. Ibrahim, the
disease is spreading despite the efforts by the National state to contain it.
The bureau head said inhabitants must set up committees at zonal and kebele
levels in a bid to prevent the disease.
Meanwhile, the malaria prevention team leader with the health department of
East Shoa Zone, said a great number of people are [fed upon] by mosquitoes in
the Rift Valley area, which is an ideal place for arthropod multiplication.
Similarly, chairman of the Adami Tulu Woreda council and certain
representatives said most of the victims are children and elders. They said
they will set up malaria prevention committees to launch a weekly campaign
beginning this month through November with the aim to clean their respective
areas.

The West Shoa Zone Health Department says 19% of the total population in the
zone is exposed to malaria epidemic.
Speaking at a public gathering Monday, malaria control panel head, Kefyalew
Regassa, said the epidemic hits the lowlands of the zone every five years.
The number of malaria patients has trebled over the last four years, he said
and indicated that 6,125 kg of DDT, chemical that kills mosquito, was sprayed
over areas prone to the epidemic.
Some 68 health assistants and kebele health representatives were trained and
deployed to carry out malaria prevention activities, the head said.
Kefyalew also expressed plans to train technicians and health professionals
in the near future. Rising price of medicines, shortage of trained man-power
and appearance of DDT-resistant mosquitoes are mentioned as the major factors
aggravating the spread of the disease.
