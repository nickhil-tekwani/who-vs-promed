The New Mexico Department of Health has just
announced the state's 2nd hantavirus death in the
state this year [2008]. It confirmed a
22-year-old woman from Otero County has died.

Hantavirus is a deadly disease transmitted by
infected rodents through urine, droppings or
saliva.

"Hantavirus is caused by rodents and rodent
dropping so what people need to do is they need
to be very careful when they are cleaning out
places. They need to use disinfectant, they need
to air them out and they really need to take a
lot of precaution," said Chris Minnick with the
New Mexico Department of Health.

Last year New Mexico had 3 cases of Hantavirus with one death.

[Although this report does not indicate which
hantavirus is the etiological agent responsible
for this case, it is most likely to be Sin Nombre
virus for which the rodent reservoir host is the
deer mouse, _Peromyscus maniculatus_, (image

A 24-year-old tourist from England died in a
Temuco hospital this week [1-5 Dec 1008],
presumably the victim of a hantavirus infection
he developed while traveling in nearby Argentina,
the Chilean daily El Mecurio reported. The man
spent several days in the San Martin de los Andes
area of Argentina before crossing into Chile's
Region IX this past weekend [29-30 Nov 2008].
Upon arriving in Pucon, the English traveler
complained of flu-like symptoms and severe
respiratory problems. [He was] 1st treated in a
local hospital, then was later transferred to
Temuco√≠s Clinica Alemana, where he passed away on
Tuesday [2 Dec 2008].

Although health authorities have yet to confirm
the exact cause of death, they suspect the man
may have been infected by a particularly virulent
hantavirus strain so far unknown on the Chilean
side of the border.

Southern Chile and Argentina are recognized
hotspots for the deadly virus, which was 1st
discovered in the early 1950s during the Korean
War. The illness in fact takes its name from
South Korea's Hantaan River. Hantavirus [sic] is
also present in the United States, Europe, China,
Russia, Brazil and Panama.

Humans can contract the virus through contact
with rodents and their urine or feces. Dried
rodent droppings, which can turn to power and
thus be inhaled by people, are particularly
dangerous.

The illness usually takes 2-4 weeks to incubate
and can begin with severe flu-like symptoms. It
can eventually cause internal hemorrhaging and
major organ failure.

According to Chile's Health Ministry, there have
been 37 confirmed hantavirus cases this year, 7
of them fatal. Since 2001, 209 people (38 percent
of the 581 confirmed cases) have been killed by
the illness in Chile.

[Although this article does not specify the
hantavirus involved, it is probably Andes virus.
Its rodent host is the long-tailed pygmy rice
rat, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_. This article
implies that there is just one hantavirus, when,
in fact, there are multiple hantaviruses in
diverse places in the world, many in South
America. The virus involved in the above case
certainly is NOT the Asian Hantaan virus, as was
mentioned in this article, which is the virus
that causes Korean hemorrhagic fever. An image of
the long-tailed pygmy rice rat can be accessed at
<http://www.bios.niu.edu/frayjorge/oligoryzomys_rat.jpg>.

Mod.CP provided excellent comments in ProMED
archive number 20060220.0553 as follows:
Hantaviruses in South America are maintained in
sigmodontine rodents. Neither the viruses
responsible nor their presumed rodents hosts have
been identified. Several hantaviruses have been
associated with human infection in Argentina:
Andes virus (western Argentina, in the
long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys
longicaudatus_), related Andes-like viruses
Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host
unknown), Lechiguanas (in central Argentina in
_O. flavescens_), Oran (in northwestern Argentina
in _O. longicaudatus_), and Bermejo (western
Argentina in _O. flavescens_) virus. Other
hantaviruses are present in various South
American countries and in Panama.

The CDC has an excellent Power Point presentation on hantaviruses at:
