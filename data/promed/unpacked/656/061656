An epidemic of pertussis (whooping cough) in Australia has resulted in 7000
cases this year. Although only 9 persons have died of the disease, this
number is almost half of the number of fatalities over the previous 20
years. In the Australian Capitol Territory (Canberra) there has been a
doubling of pertussis cases since 1996, despite health ministry programs
urging parents to get their children immunized.

[Several weeks ago, we had a discussion of a strain of _Bordetella
pertussis_ that has exhibited an antigenic shift that could result in
decreased vaccine efficacy. See reference: Pertussis outbreak -
Netherlands (02), response, cited above. It would be of interest to know
whether scientists from Australia were in communication with those from the
Netherlands who have done this work. If any such collaboration is ongoing,
we would be pleased to hear about it. - Mod.ES
