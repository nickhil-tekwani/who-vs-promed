Foot and mouth disease in Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region of
the People's Republic of China, detection of virus type Asia 1
-----------------------------------------------
Information received on 23 Mar 2005 from the Director of the
Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD), Hong Kong.

Report date: 23 Mar 2005.

On 9 Mar 2005, 16 cattle in lairage in Sheung Shui slaughterhouse,
New Territories, were reported to have lesions typical of foot and
mouth disease (FMD). The diagnostic tests used (indirect sandwich
ELISA for antigen detection for FMD viruses of serotypes O, A and
Asia 1 and swine vesicular disease virus; virus genome detection by
RT-PCR; cell culture and serotyping) showed the virus involved to be
of serotype Asia 1. FMD virus serotype O is endemic in Hong Kong, and
a vaccination program is in place, but no evidence of serotype Asia 1
had been found till now.

Total number of susceptible animals in the outbreak: 7147 pigs, 560
bovines, 120 goats.

Total number of cases: 16 bovines.

Total number of animals slaughtered: 7147 pigs, 560 bovines, 120 goats.

Source of agent/origin of infection: unconfirmed at this stage,
investigations are continuing.

Control measures:

- All susceptible animals in the lairage were slaughtered.
- The slaughterhouse was disinfected.
- Relevant veterinary authorities were notified.
- Local pig farms are under regular surveillance, and biosecurity has
been increased.
- The single cattle farm in Hong Kong has been placed under close surveillance.
- Serological surveillance of stray cattle and buffalo has been increased.

[Although Hong Kong has reported FMD serotype O to the OIE every year
between 1997 and 2004, the occurrence of a new strain should be
watched carefully. Since 2001, the Asia 1 strain has been isolated
from animals in Afghanistan, Bhutan, Georgia, Iran, Pakistan and
Myanmar. In 1997, one of the most devastating FMD epidemics was
caused by an O type FMD virus; the swine industry in Taiwan has yet
to fully recover. - Mod.PC]
