[Following Germany, the Netherlands and UK, Italy is the 4th EU country where H5N8 avian influenza has been identified.

The EU control measures for avian influenza are described in the Council Directive 2005/94/EC; see http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32005L0094&from=EN.

According to the European Commission - Health and Consumers: "Measures to prevent and control avian influenza are coordinated at EU level. There are preventive measures against avian influenza which must be implemented by all the Member States and surveillance for the disease has been increased. Prescribed measures must be enacted by national authorities if there is a suspected or confirmed case of highly pathogenic avian influenza in either wild birds or domestic flocks in their territories. EU import bans have also been placed on potentially risky poultry products and susceptible imports from 3rd countries with HPAI outbreaks. When there is an outbreak in a domestic poultry holding, all birds must be culled and measures are taken to prevent the further spread of the infection to other holdings. Zones with movement restriction (protection and surveillance zones) are established. In these zones, movement of live poultry and certain poultry products are restricted. Poultry has to be kept indoors and must be closely monitored.

"Epidemiological investigations are ongoing to identify the possible source of virus. The fact that the 3 recent outbreaks in Germany, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom have occurred in proximity of humid areas with wild birds and the absence of any other epidemiological link between them, point towards wild migratory birds as the likely source of virus. Member States concerned are evaluating their wild bird surveillance data and are enhancing monitoring. Consequently, the Commission has asked all EU Member States to increase biosecurity on poultry farms.

"Further virus characterizations indicate that the detected HPAI H5N8 virus is similar to others of Asian origin. Since the beginning of the year [2014], that virus has caused several outbreaks in poultry farms in South Korea and was also detected in Japan and China" (http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/avian/index_en.htm).
