Soybean farmers battle 'sudden death' disease
---------------------------------------------
Sudden death syndrome has struck soybean crops across Knox County and
throughout the region, cutting yields as much as 20 percent in some fields.
The syndrome is nearly impossible to prevent and harder to kill. "When you
see this, it's a done deal," said Chuck Mansfield, an extension agronomist
at Purdue University, assessing plants with brown leaves in Indiana soybean
field.
An estimated 80 percent of Knox County's soybean fields show signs of the
fungal disease, said Jerry Nelson, Purdue University extension educator for
Knox County, about 50 miles north of Evansville. "It's more widespread in
the county than it's ever been, and it's more severe," Nelson said.
Farmers in other southern Indiana counties, western Kentucky and southern
Illinois also report damage from the disease, but it's nearly impossible to
assess the damage at this point. According to Nelson, the extent of crop
damage won't be known until the crops have been harvested.
Sudden death syndrome was first observed in Arkansas in 1971, but was not
identified in Indiana until 1985. It also occurs in Illinois, Kentucky,
Iowa, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Kansas and Tennessee. "Some years it can
be a fairly major problem and some years you'll see very little of it," said
Todd Pfeiffer, professor and soybean breeder at the University of Kentucky.
The disease is caused by a soilborne fungus that affects the lateral roots
of soybean plants. Significant rainfall -- such as what was seen in the
region in July -- can activate the problem.
Although it's called sudden death, the disease is present long before the
symptoms arise. It's a slow death, but it appears suddenly and keeps
creeping across the field said Mike Brocksmith, an Indiana farmer.
Sonny Primus of Vincennes, IN was one of the first farmers to report
the disease in Knox County. That was 1987, and he's battled it at some level
every year since. On the 350 acres of soybeans he has planted this year,
Primus said he expects to get about half the normal yield in certain fields.
Purdue University researchers use about 6 acres of Primus' property for
research on the disease.

[Sudden death syndrome (SDS) in soybean is caused by toxin-producing
strains of _Fusarium solani_ f. sp._ glycines_. The disease has been
reported in most major soybean production areas of the United States and
was found in 1998 at Essex, ON, Canada. To differentiate between
SDS-causing isolates and other _F. solani_ isolates, a partial sequence of
the mitochondrial small subunit ribosomal RNA gene was amplified by PCR
and sequenced from 14 _F. solani_ f. sp._ glycines_and 24 _F. solani_
isolates from various plant hosts. All SDS-inducing isolates had identical
nucleotide sequences and were clearly different from non-SDS isolates.
Genetic resistance to SDS is limited. An integrated disease management
strategy depends on using cultivars with some degree of resistance, delayed
planting, tilling to promote earlier warming of soils, and planting of
earlier-maturing cultivars.
