[2] Vertical transmission, mosquitoes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Dengue virus (DENV) is transmitted to humans by the bite of the vector _Aedes aegypti_. Several researchers have suggested that the mechanism of vertical transmission of DENV in the vector is a key aspect for the prevalence of the virus in the environment and the potentiation of epidemic outbreaks of the disease. In this context and as part of an integrated study of DENV serotypes in mosquitoes of urban areas in Sinaloa, Mexico, the presence of DENV-4 in larval stages of _Ae. aegypti_ was evaluated to demonstrate the vertical transmission of this serotype. In total, 672 larvae of _Ae. aegypti_ were collected in 16 sectors and were grouped into 36 pools, of which 41.7% (15/36 pools) tested positive for DENV-4, with a minimum infection rate = 22.32. The analysis of the obtained sequences showed a 98% similarity to the DENV-4 with sequences previously reported in GenBank. These results show that _Ae. aegypti_ acts as a natural reservoir for DENV-4 in this region.

[_Aedes aegypti_ acting as a reservoir of dengue-4 virus depends on the establishment of a stabilized infection, wherein the virus is vertically transmitted through many generations. Determination of stabilized infection will require relevant laboratory experiments. This would be important to do because it bears directly on the ability to eliminate dengue virus in that specific area. It also underscores the importance of effective reduction or elimination of _Ae. aegypti_ populations in dengue virus endemic areas. - Mod.TY]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
The mosquito _Aedes aegypti_ is the primary vector of many disease-causing viruses, including dengue (DENV), Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever. As a consequence of climate change, we expect an increase in both global mean temperatures and extreme climatic events. When temperatures fluctuate, mosquito vectors will be increasingly exposed to temperatures beyond their upper thermal limits. Here, we examine how DENV infection alters _Ae. aegypti_ thermotolerance by using a high-throughput physiological 'knockdown' assay modeled on studies in _Drosophila_. Such laboratory measures of thermal tolerance have previously been shown to accurately predict an insect's distribution in the field. We show that DENV infection increases thermal sensitivity, an effect that may ultimately limit the geographic range of the virus. We also show that the endosymbiotic bacterium _Wolbachia pipientis_, which is currently being released globally as a biological control agent, has a similar impact on thermal sensitivity in _Ae. aegypti_. Surprisingly, in the coinfected state, _Wolbachia_ did not provide protection against DENV-associated effects on thermal tolerance, nor were the effects of the 2 infections additive. The latter suggests that the microbes may act by similar means, potentially through activation of shared immune pathways or energetic tradeoffs. Models predicting future ranges of both virus transmission and _Wolbachia's_ efficacy following field release may wish to consider the effects these microbes have on host survival.

Author summary
--------------
Changes in global climate, which include higher temperatures and more frequent extreme temperature events, are expected to cause dramatic shifts in the distributions of infectious diseases. The geographic range of the mosquito _Ae. aegypti_ continues to expand, risking greater incidence of viral diseases including dengue (DENV), Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever. One emerging solution to control these viruses is the release of the insect bacterium _Wolbachia_, whose infection in mosquitoes reduces virus transmission to humans. However, the effects of rising temperatures on the efficacy of this tool are unclear. Here, we studied whether DENV and _Wolbachia_ can alter the thermal sensitivity of the mosquito _Ae. aegypti_ by using a heat-based physiological assay. We demonstrate that, separately, DENV and _Wolbachia_ infections increase mosquito thermal sensitivity, causing more rapid death when mosquitoes are exposed to extreme heat. The impacts of the microbes on mosquito thermal sensitivity were similar but not additive, suggesting they affect the mosquito in similar ways. Our work demonstrates that future global projections of DENV transmission risk and of _Wolbachia's_ potential efficacy may need to consider the impact of these microbes on vector survival.

[One hopes that there will be follow up field studies to determine if the temperature effects seen in this interesting study are replicated in the real world. This is especially important since _Wolbachia_ is being field tested currently in several countries to suppress dengue virus transmission in areas where the virus is endemic. It would be interesting to know if the temperature tolerances and preference of _Aedes aegypti_ vary in populations found in very hot versus cooler localities as an indication of the adaptability of this mosquito at this time of changing climate. - Mod.TY]
