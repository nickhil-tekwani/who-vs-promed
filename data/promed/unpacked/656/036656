Goat plague [peste des petits ruminants, PPR] has been diagnosed in a dairy goat farm in the Kishorit Village, situated in Kibbutz Kishor [see comment] in Western Galilee [in Hazafon, northern district], northwestern of the town of Carmiel, within the regulatory boundaries of the District Veterinary Office of Western Galilee, Akko [Acre]

This duly registered goat flock includes about 1510 animals (475 milking does, 185 dry does, about 310 males including kids, and about 525 yearling does and younger female kids. The flock was last vaccinated against PPR on 26 Dec 2013.

The total number of diseased animals -- pregnant yearlings and males -- is 80. Typical PPR signs have been observed: pneumonia, diarrhea, abortion (in 20 yearlings). Mortality was recorded in 10 yearlings.

Laboratory tests have been applied: swabs and biopsy samples found PCR positive for PPR. Quarantine has been imposed upon the flock.

Investigations are ongoing; updates will be published.

[According to the website http://kishor-winery.com/kishorit-products, Kishorit is an extraordinary residential community for adults with special needs, situated within the Kibbutz "Kishor". Based on the kibbutz model of a common economy, Kishorit owns and operates a number of businesses. Every business is overseen by a professional manager and job coaches who guide and support the members.

One of the main activities of Kishorit is the Organic Goat Dairy and Cheese Factory. The large (in Israeli criteria) organic dairy goat operation, comprised of more than 1500 goats, reportedly produces more than 400 000 liters of milk annually. The milk is sold to an organic dairy in north Israel, surplus milk processed locally into "wide range of hard and soft cheese", produced for the members of Kishorit and the general market. Obviously, such an operation runs a risk of considerable losses if/when affected by a highly infectious disease.

According to the press release above, PPR has affected specifically young stock, born after the most recent PPR vaccination (late December 2013). These animals have been susceptible after losing their acquired maternal antibodies. Vaccinated sheep and goat flocks in PPR-affected countries deserve to be visited at frequent intervals in order to maintain the desirable herd immunity. Manufacturers recommend the following Vaccination Schedule for the "PPR75/1 (EMVY strain)" vaccine.

Primary vaccination:
Animals over 6 months: one injection
Animals under 6 months: 2 injections at a 2 to 6 month interval; due to the possible persistence of maternal antibody, the second injection should only be given to animals over 6 months old.

Boosters:
According to the legislation in force in the country
Annual booster is recommended to increase the vaccination coverage.

Israel suffered its 1st PPR outbreak, most probably introduced from Lebanon, in 1993. In March 2006, Israel replaced the heterologous rinderpest tissue culture vaccine (Plowright rinderpest vaccine), applied since 1993 for the mass vaccination of small ruminants against PPR, in favour of the live attenuated homologous PPR virus vaccine, which became commercially available during the late 1990s. This change was followed immediately by a significant improvement, expressed by the absence of clinical PPR in Israel for several years: no cases were reported between February 2006 and October 2011, when 2 interconnected outbreaks were diagnosed. One small outbreak was reported in 2012 (Houra, south Israel) and one in 2013 (Deir-el-Assad, north Israel). The current outbreak is indicative of the need to maintain complete and timely vaccinations within the region. PPR is endemic in all of Israel's neighbouring countries -- Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and Egypt.

A graph showing the number of Israel's PPR outbreaks 1993 - 2013 is available in the 2013 annual report of Israel's Veterinary Services & Animal Health (VSAH) (in Hebrew): see page 32 at http://www.moag.gov.il/agri/files/doch_shnati_2013.pdf.

PPR is a widespread, virulent, and devastating disease of small ruminants with significant economic, food security and livelihood impacts. The disease is caused by a morbillivirus closely related to the rinderpest virus (globally eradicated in 2011). PPR is considered as one of the top most damaging animal diseases in Africa, the Middle East and Asia. PPR is also one of the priority diseases indicated in the FAO-OIE Global Framework for the Progressive Control of Transboundary Animal Diseases (GF-TADs) Global level 5 Year Action Plan (2013-2017).

An international conference for the Control and Eradication of PPR has been recently (31 Mar-2 Apr 2015) held by FAO and OIE in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire. Subscribers are encouraged to visit the Conference's website at http://www.oie.int/eng/ppr2015/background.html, and particularly note the presented document "Global Strategy for the Control and Eradication of PPR" (available at http://www.oie.int/eng/ppr2015/doc/PPR-Global-Strategy-avecAnnexes_2015-03-28.pdf). The authors indicate that around 70 countries have either reported PPR infection to the OIE or are suspected of being infected. Of these, more than 60 percent are in Africa (including North Africa) the other infected countries being in Asia (South-East Asia, China, South Asia, and Central Asia/West Eurasia, including Turkey) and the Middle East. Another 50 countries are considered to be at risk for PPR. As of May 2014, 48 countries in the world were officially recognised by the OIE as PPR free.

According to the conference organisers, the eradication of PPR will have a major positive impact, not only on the livelihoods of poor farmers, but also on the Post-2015 Development Goals and the UN's Zero Hunger Challenge (http://www.un.org/en/zerohunger/challenge.shtml). It will also highlight the role played by the veterinary profession in poverty alleviation and food security. - Mod.AS
