The growth of a serious barley problem in the south-east
--------------------------------------------------------
Most spring barley fields in the Wexford [County] area are affected, to some degree, by barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) this year [2017], according to Teagasc's [Agriculture and Food Development Authority] Ciaran Hickey. "It can be as low as 5 per cent of the field affected in some areas. But the average is more like 15 per cent, with some fields up to 30 per cent. There is an obvious yellow cast across the area." The scale of the BYDV challenge is set to grow [and] is now a real talking point with both feed and malting barley growers. BYDV is more apparent in later-sown crops and sheltered, coastal areas.

"The reality is that we now have a grain aphid population that is resistant to the pyrethroid aphicides that are currently available. Farmers are deeply concerned." He said that new chemistries to control aphids had failed to materialise. His feeling was that this may be due to the longer registration periods that are required to get new products onto the market. "BYDV is a real yield-robber. The launch of a new aphicide had previously been expected for 2017. But this has now been put back. The potential is there for serious problems to be created down the line. BYDV is a battle which [farmers] cannot win at the present time, as they do not have the required tools."

[Barley yellow dwarf (BYD) disease occurs worldwide and affects a wide range of grass species (Gramineae) including cereal crops like barley, wheat, oats, rice, maize, and rye. It is the most destructive of the virus diseases of wheat. Grain yields may be reduced by 1/3rd. Symptoms include leaf discolouration from yellow to purple (depending on the host species), stunting, reduced tillering, and empty seed heads. Plants infected in autumn may not survive the winter or show severe symptoms when growth resumes. Diseased plants often occur in circular patches within a field, which are associated with colonisation by the aphid vectors.

BYD viruses have now been split into several species in the family Luteoviridae (mostly in the genus _Luteovirus_). They are differentiated by their ability to be transmitted by various aphid species (family Aphididae) and their virulence on a selected variety of oats. Some of the viruses are transmitted equally well by several aphids, whereas others can be transmitted by only one or 2 species. The bird cherry(-oat) aphid (_Rhopalosiphum padi_) and grain (wheat) aphid (_Sitobion avenae_) are vectors of the severe _Barley yellow dwarf virus-PAV_ (type member of genus _Luteovirus_). Coinfections of several BYD viruses may occur in one plant, which can result in either more severe (synergistic) or milder (due to cross protection) symptoms, depending on the virus partners.

The viruses cannot be transmitted by seed, pollen or mechanical means and cannot survive in stubble or in the soil. Volunteer cereal plants or grassy weeds may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Disease management includes use of resistant cultivars and control of the aphid vectors.
