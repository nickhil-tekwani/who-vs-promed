Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -- Oman
---------------------------------------------------------------
Between [7 and 10 Jan 2015], the National IHR Focal Point of Oman notified WHO of 2 additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, including 1 death.

Details of the [cases] are as follows:
- A 32-year-old male from Dakhelyia Region who developed symptoms on [27 Dec 2014] and was admitted to hospital on [5 Jan 2015]. The patient had comorbidities. He owned a farm and had frequent contact with camels, goats and sheep. The patient had no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. He was admitted to ICU but passed away on [7 Jan 2015].
- A 31-year-old female from Dakhelyia Region who developed symptoms on [8 Jan 2015] and was admitted to hospital on [9 Jan 2015]. The patient has no comorbidities. She is a household contact of the MERS-CoV case reported above. The household owns camels but she had no direct contact with them. The patient is in stable condition and remains in isolation.

Contact tracing of household contacts and healthcare contacts is ongoing for these cases.

Globally, WHO has been notified of 950 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 350 related deaths.

[These cases were previously reported by the Omani Ministry of Health, although epidemiologic details were not provided at the time of report (MERS-CoV (06): Oman, new case, RFI 20150111.3085228 and MERS-CoV (04): Oman, Saudi Arabia, RFI 20150108.3079584). As a reminder, a serologic survey on camels in Oman revealed 50/50 (100 percent) camels studied with evidence of MERS-CoV infection (see Reusken CB1, Haagmans BL, Muller MA, Gutierrez C, Godeke GJ, Meyer B, Muth D, Raj VS, Smits-De Vries L, Corman VM, Drexler JF, Smits SL, El Tahir YE, De Sousa R, van Beek J, Nowotny N, van Maanen K, Hidalgo-Hermoso E, Bosch BJ, Rottier P, Osterhaus A, Gortazar-Schmidt C, Drosten C, Koopmans MP.

Counting these cases as well as the cases confirmed by the Saudis through 5 Jan 2015 (see [3] below), the current global tally of MERS-CoV infection reported to and confirmed by WHO is now 950, including at least 350 deaths (case fatality rate 36.8 percent).

[With the addition of these newly reported fatalities, the case fatality rate in Saudi Arabia is 43.1 percent (835 cases, including 360 deaths). The 93-year-old Saudi male from Riyadh was reported to be in critical condition on 14 Jan 2015, with a possible history of contact with a known or confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection in the healthcare environment. The 45-year-old Saudi male from Dammam was reported to be in stable condition on 3 Jan 2015, and according to the WHO report below in [3], had a history of frequenting a friend's camel farm but denied history of direct contact with the camels.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -- Saudi Arabia
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Between [3 and 5 Jan 2015], the National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) notified WHO of 3 additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection.

Details of the cases are as follows:
- A 69-year-old male from Najran city who developed symptoms on [23 Dec 2014] and was admitted to hospital on [2 Jan 2015]. The patient has comorbidities. Although his neighbours rear camels, the patient has neither a history of direct contact with them nor of consuming raw camel products. In the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms, he travelled to Yemen. He has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days that preceded the onset of symptoms. Currently, the patient is in stable condition and remains in an isolation ward.
- A 76-year-old male from Taif city who developed symptoms on [26 Dec 2014] and was admitted to hospital on [31 Dec 2014]. The patient has comorbidities as well as a history of frequent contact with camels and raw camel milk consumption. He has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. Currently, the patient is in ICU and remains in critical condition.
- A 45-year-old male from Dammam city who developed symptoms on [31 Dec 2014] and was admitted to hospital on [1 Jan 2015]. The patient has no comorbidities. Although he frequently visits his friends' camel farm, the patient has no history of direct contact with camels. The patient has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. Currently, he is in stable condition and remains in isolation.

Cases are listed by date of reporting, with the most recent case listed 1st.

Contact tracing of household contacts and healthcare contacts is ongoing for these cases.

The National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia also notified WHO of the death of 1 previously reported MERS-CoV case.

Globally, WHO has been notified of 948 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 349 related deaths.

[The common theme in the above 3 reports seems to be contact (direct or indirect) with camels or camel products, or contact with previously confirmed MERS-CoV infected individuals. It would be of interest to learn results of studies on the herds/caravans of camels the above cases (Omani and Saudi) had either direct or indirect contact with to see if MERS-CoV can be identified and sequenced in members of those herds and if so, if they are genetically related to those identified in the human cases.

According to figures maintained by the ECDC, as of 15 Jan 2015, there have been a total of 974 cases of MERS-CoV, including 394 deaths (case fatality rate 40.5 percent) reported by local health authorities worldwide since April 2012. Note that these figures differ from those reported by WHO, partly because the ECDC data include 7 additional cases reported by Saudi Arabia between 7 and 14 Jan 2015, and partly because these include cases confirmed retrospectively by serologic testing (Jordan) and others not included in the WHO statistics. (http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/communicable-disease-threats-report-16-jan-2015.pdf).
