With little awareness about increasing hepatitis C cases in the northeast, activists and medical practitioners warned that unless effective programs were implemented, there would be a further escalation in the number of people acquiring this virus.

Often referred to as a viral time bomb [because it may be clinically silent until cirrhosis or liver cancer develop decades later. - Mod.LL], the disease is widespread among intravenous drug users (IDUs). Manipur's Surachanpur and Bishnupur districts have the highest number of people carrying the hepatitis C virus (HCV), with prevalence rates among the districts' IDUs being nearly 90 percent and 78 percent respectively.

In Nagaland's Wokha and Phek districts, the prevalence rate, as per an Integrated Bio Behavioural Assessment Round 2 Testing, conducted in 2009 by the Indian Council of Medical Research and others, was 20.8 percent and 8.7 percent respectively. Prior studies showed that in Manipur, the prevalence rate of HCV is 55 to 80 percent among IDUs, as opposed to 22 to 33 percent HIV prevalence among them.

"The main objective is to create awareness about viral hepatitis in the region. The epidemic is at our doorstep, with people getting infected, testing positive and some deaths being reported. However, NGOs and the government continue to ignore the spread of the disease," said Ketho, general secretary of Hepatitis Coalition of Nagaland (HEPCON).

With much of the focus being restricted to HIV-AIDS and cancer awareness, HCV often escapes attention. With no proper cure or vaccine, course-related HCV treatment is also considered too expensive. People with HCV are prone to develop chronicity that can lead to liver damages. Research show that close to 75 to 85 percent HCV patients develop chronicity, as opposed to hepatitis B patients (HBV) [which is about 5 percent. - Mod.LL]

"Intravenous drug users are the most vulnerable. HCV prevalence is much higher than that of HIV. This indicates that there is a bigger pool of HCV patients among IDUs," said Gajendra Kumar Medhi, doctor and scientist with the Indian Council of Medical Research.

Another factor responsible for the high prevalence of HCV amongst IDUs is needle-sharing. Even with efforts to promote safe injecting practices, the prevalence of needle-sharing is quite high. Users may lessen sharing of syringes, but indirect sharing is widely practiced. Nearly 50 to 70 percent IDUs admitted to sharing accessories like common containers for drug preparation, filter cotton and rinse water.

[As yet, there is no available vaccine for the hepatitis C virus so prevention of transmission of the disease needs to be aimed at high risk groups such as intravenous drug users who share their "works". Needle exchange programs do work in decreasing transmission. Neither the statement that a needle exchange program (NEP) encourages increased drug use among program participants or the recruitment of 1st-time drug users, nor a parallel statement that the availability of the "morning after" pill encourages increased sexual contact are at all true.

The following reference is presented in support of NEPs:
