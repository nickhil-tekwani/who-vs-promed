Nepal
- Kathmandu. 12 Oct 2018. A 36-year old male resident of Banasthali, Kathmandu visited to Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital (OPD) with a 2-day history of fever with chills, headache, pain behind the eyes, red eyes, severe body ache and joint pain. He was tested positive for dengue virus (NS1 positive). The next day, his brother, who has been living with him, also developed similar symptoms and was also tested positive for dengue virus (NS1 positive). Both gave no history of travel outside Kathmandu. They said there are too many mosquitoes inside their room. _Aedes agypti_ mosquitoes are well established in Kathmandu. This is the 1st report of indigenous dengue fever cases in Kathmandu this year (2018).

Bangladesh
- Dhaka. 13 Oct 2018. 39 new patients cases rise to 6694. Highest total in this country to date. According to sources at the Health Emergency and Control Room of Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), 39 new patients were hospitalized in Dhaka on Thursday [11 Oct 2018], raising the total number of those infected by the mosquito-borne disease this year [2018] to 6694. The previous highest was 6232 cases confirmed in 2002.
https://www.dhakatribune.com/health/2018/10/13/dengue-fever-death-toll-hits-highest-level-on-record

- Dhaka. 6 Oct 2018. It's a record 6479 [patients] as of Wednesday [3 Oct 2018] since January 2018, with 3 more months of the year to go.
"Look at last year [2018]. A much lower record," she said and pointed to the black line. Only 2769 patients took treatment at hospitals. And 2014, a blue line, looks so meek compared with the figure this year. Just 375 patients were admitted to hospitals that year. If this is not bad enough, then consider the fact that this year a new variety of dengue virus, called serotype 3, has appeared for the 1st time in Bangladesh. Such cross infections lead to haemorrhagic dengue, which means the patients will bleed from their organs. As a new type has been added to the hordes of mosquitoes, chances of such cross infection have also increased. Another chilling fact is that the number of fatalities this year has dramatically increased to 16 in 9 months this year from last year's 8. But a doctor from the state-run IEDCR said the actual number of deaths could be much higher as many cases are not reported.

https://www.ndarinfo.com/6-cas-de-dengue-enregistres-a-Rosso-Senegal_a23172.html

- National. 15 Oct 2018. Dengue fever worries the population in several localities of Senegal. Fatick area has 3 cases. Currently, at least 23 dengue cases have been confirmed in the same region of Fatick (center), following tests on 487 suspected cases, revealed the chief of the commune, Mamadou Sarr at the beginning of October 2018.

In Senegal, dengue fever is concentrated this year [2018] in the Fatick region. In September 2018, 3 cases had been counted; the number rose to 23 cases in October 2018. According to the chief medical officer of the local area relayed by the Senegalese press agency: "Following tests on 487 suspected cases, at least 23 dengue cases were confirmed, and the average age of people affected by the disease varies between 20 and 40 years old. Most are women.

This is the 4th dengue epidemic in Senegal. On 19 Oct 2017, the disease was revealed to the public in the Louga region. The Institut Pasteur in Dakar confirmed the diagnosis of 9 cases of dengue fever out of a total of 24 samples received on 6 and 12 Oct 2017, respectively, which had been carried out at the Santhiaba health post in Louga commune, in northwest Senegal. On 27 and 28 Oct 2018, 2 other confirmed cases were recorded in the commune of Dahra, next to that of Louga. On 6 Nov 2017, the Senegalese health authorities recorded 79 confirmed cases out of 510 samples tested: 70 in Louga, 6 in Dahra, 2 in Coki, 1 in Keur Moma Sarr. "No serious case is noted so far. All the patients have been treated as outpatients," said the Ministry of Health and Social Action. This is not the 1st time that an outbreak of dengue fever has been reported in the country. There were outbreaks also in 1981, 1984 and 2009, said Dr. Abdoulaye Bousso of the Center for Emergency Health Operations (COUS), an entity under the supervision of the Ministry of Health and Social Action in 2017. As of 30 Oct 2017, a total of 232 suspected patients, out of 36 positive cases (34 in Louga and 2 in Dahra), had been enumerated by the Senegalese health authorities. "No complication was noted in these patients; all patients diagnosed positive are doing well and have resumed their daily activities," said the Ministry of Health. For this year [2018], the number increased to 32 confirmed cases.

Italy
- Veneto Region. 29 Sep 2018. 1st case of dengue of the year [2018]. After 11 infections caused by the West Nile virus, there is now also this tropical disease that is also transmitted by a mosquito of the genus _Aedes_, which manifests itself as a normal flu with high fever, strong joint and muscle pain, eye pain and rash, a rash similar to that of measles, which is often asymptomatic and almost always resolves without consequences but in 5 percent of cases can develop into a dangerous hemorrhage and become lethal.

France
- Alpes-Maritimes. 18 Oct 2018. Dengue outbreak detected after 4 new cases. There are now 5 people who have contracted dengue, reports the Paca Regional Health Agency and the prefecture of the Alpes-Maritimes, which has evoked a "localized outbreak of dengue circulation" in Saint-Laurent-du-Var in the Alpes-Maritimes, after the reporting of 4 new cases.

Spain
- Granada Province. 10 Oct 2018. Alhama de Granada. The Ministry of Health has confirmed that 3 Spanish citizens have been infected by the dengue virus, without any of them having traveled to areas where this disease is present. Those infected by the dengue virus had been in Cadiz, Murcia and Madrid. Now regional authorities are trying to discover the source of the infections. The ministry went on to say all those receiving treatment are in good health and are expected to make a full recovery.
https://www.englishradionews.com/news/spain/dengue-fever-discovered-in-three-in-spain/

- Autochthonous Dengue transmission. 9 Oct 2018. The National Centre for Microbiology at the Instituto de Salud Carlos III confirmed on 4 Oct 2018 2 laboratory-confirmed cases and one suspected case (pending confirmation) of dengue virus infection in 3 family members. The individuals, residents of Madrid and Murcia, had travelled internally within Spain to the regions of Cadiz and Murcia, where it is presumed they acquired the infection. They had not travelled outside Spain to areas typically endemic for dengue. Their clinical condition is said to be progressing favourably.
The Asian tiger mosquito (_Aedes albopictus_), the likely vector, is now established in Spain and particularly prevalent in the Southern & Mediterranean regions. In response to these cases, an investigation has been launched into the cases detected & their likely sites of acquisition. Other actions taken include an entomological investigation; retrospective case finding of other possible undetected cases and issuing of communication to healthcare and laboratory professionals to be aware of and notify any further possible cases to the authorities. The press release emphasizes that despite the possibility of autochthonous transmission given the widespread distribution of a competent vector, the actual risk of this eventuality remains very low especially given the likely decrease in vector concentration expected in autumn 2018.

[2] Dengue Neutralizing Antibody Research
Date: 18 Oct 2018
Source: Biospace [edited]
https://www.biospace.com/article/ostrich-antibody-as-a-dengue-fever-solution-is-now-ready-for-commercialization/


MAZ World and ZEAL Cosmetics have confirmed that Ostrich Antibodies are effective in neutralising all 4 serotypes of dengue viruses; providing a new avenue for dengue prevention and/or treatment. The neutralisation testing of the 4 dengue serotypes was performed in collaboration with the Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology (IMCB) in Singapore.

Dengue as a mosquito-borne infectious disease is prevalent in many parts of Asia and countries along the tropical and subtropical belt, including Singapore. While last year [2017] the dengue cases have fallen to the lowest number in 16 years for Singapore: 2772 cases, the neighbouring areas such as Viet Nam and Philippines still faced a huge number of cases nationwide: 108 925 and 67 601 nationwide respectively. The 1st partially effective dengue vaccine was commercially available in 2016; this vaccine, however, has caused controversy due to its extreme case side-effects on receivers who haven't had dengue previously, limiting the receivers to those who live in the area of exposure and who had been previously infected by the virus.

The production of ostrich antibodies was spearheaded by Professor Yasuhiro Tsukamoto of the Kyoto Prefectural University. Since then, Professor Tsukamoto has extensive experience in researching ostrich antibodies, with his work recognized by the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) and Japan's Ministry of Health.

As one of the largest birds on earth, ostriches aren't just the fastest 2-legged animal on land. Ostriches also live up to 60 years. When bird-related diseases affect many other species of birds, ostriches are capable of surviving such outbreaks. Professor Yasuhiro Tsukamoto of the Kyoto Prefectural University believes that this is due to their strong antibodies. Antibodies are blood proteins produced by the host in response to specific antigens such as bacteria or viruses. Antibodies neutralize these antigens by binding and preventing them from entering the cells, protecting the host from falling sick or catching certain diseases. Ostriches also lay one of the largest sizes of eggs, offering the potential for antibodies to be harvested economically and with high yields for use in treatment of bacterial and viral infections. With the positive result on the dengue test, ostrich antibodies are hoped to solve the limitation and side-effect problems in relation to dengue prevention and therapeutics.

On the other hand, the dengue-neutralising effectiveness test was spearheaded by Dr. Justin Jang Hann Chu, Joint Principal Investigator at A*STAR's IMCB. Dr. Chu is actively engaged in the application of genome wide gene silencing technology, molecular virology, bioimaging and proteomics techniques on dengue virus enteroviruses and chikungunya virus. His papers are published in prestigious journals including Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), Journal of Biological Chemistry (JBC) and Journal of Virology (JVI). He was awarded the prestigious Singapore Millennium Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowship in 2006, and 2 US patents have also been generated from his current research.

Based on the success of this testing, MAZ World Limited, the company, which manages the Ostrich Antibody IP, will take over research and technology development from ZEAL Cosmetics and proceed with next phase of product research for commercialization. The 1st goal is to create a [vaccine] so that the benefit of ostrich antibody can be contributed to people in tropical climates, such as Singapore, as soon as possible. ZEAL Cosmetics will remain as the manufacturing partner to create such products.
