[1] Viet Nam: local vaccine

According to the Central Veterinary Diagnosis Centre, as of June
2008, bird flu vaccine produced by Viet Nam will be partly used in
the national bird flu vaccination programme. The research and
production of bird flu vaccine in Viet Nam is conducted by scientists
of the Institute for Science and Technology and the Veterinary Institute.
Dr. To Long Thanh, Deputy Director of the Central Veterinary
Diagnosis Centre, said that scientists have initially finalised the
1st step, creating a vaccine from an imported virus.
The Veterinary Agency has tested the vaccine on fowls to have the
accurate conclusion on the resemblance between vaccine virus types
and newly separated virus types from ill fowls in Viet Nam. Based on
the testing results, the Veterinary Agency will allow the
experimental use on a narrow scale and then in a wider scale.
Mr. Thanh said that if everything goes smoothly, around June 2008,
locally produced bird flu vaccine can participate in the national
bird flu vaccination programme 2007-2008. The Veterinary Agency is
working with the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) on the
upgrade of the bird flu vaccine production enterprise.
Viet Nam is spending hundreds of billion dong to import H5N1 and H5N2
vaccine, mainly from China, and H5N9 from Italy to vaccinate for
fowls. [One billion Dong is 61 996.85 US Dollars]. Viet Nam plans to
import around 500 million doses of the vaccine in 2007-2008. However,
in mid-2007, provinces used most of the volume of vaccine imported
for the year so the country has to import an additional 200 million doses.
According to Mr. Thanh, this additional import has caused
difficulties for Chinese producers because they only produce the
vaccine based on contracts already signed with Viet Nam.

[It will be interesting to know which "imported virus" strain is to
be included in the Vietnamese vaccine. Readers are referred to a

Widespread bird flu outbreaks in Mekong Delta
-----------------------------------------------------
Animal health officials have warned that there is a high risk of
widespread bird flu outbreaks in the Mekong Delta during the
summer-fall crop due to the increase in numbers of free-range ducks.
People in the Mekong delta have a habit of letting their flocks of
ducks roam the fields to eat the leftover rice.
Farmers in the Kien Giang and An Giang provinces and in the southern
city of Can Tho have begun harvesting their summer-fall crop and
therefore many ducks are now flocking to these areas. Unfortunately,
the local authorities do not have enough forces to keep an eye on the
bird-flu situation amongst such large numbers of free-roaming fowl.
On Wednesday [11 Jul 2007], Dinh Cong Than, the head of the Kien
Giang Animal Health Branch, said that more than 300 000 newly-hatched
chicks are being vaccinated each month. However, the province total
vaccination rate has only reached 70 percent of the target.
In related news, according to the city's Animal Health Department, 10
slaughterhouses in Districts 9 and Can Gio have been shut down for
violating pollution standards. As part of the city's plans, the
construction of 32 new sanitary slaughterhouses has begun, replacing
those that were forced to move from residential areas in the city.
On 11 Jul 2007, The Animal Health Department announced that the
central province of Quang Nam has now been free from bird flu for 21
days. Bird flu had however reoccurred in 6 farms in the northern
province of Dien Bien. The disease has killed 500 out of a flock of
2400 unvaccinated ducks aged 25 days old.
Bird flu still plagues 8 other provinces.

Healthy chicken flocks to be culled as prevention in Orlice area
----------------------------------------------------------------
Czech vets decided, after having consulted the European Commission
and the Czech Agriculture Ministry, to liquidate healthy poultry at 3
chicken farms in the area where the emergence of the dangerous H5N1
bird flu virus strain was confirmed on Wed [11 Jul 2007], Zbynek
Semerad from the State Veterinary Administration told CTK today.
The poultry will be culled at 2 farms in the village of Loucky and at
a farm in the village of Zarecka Lhota. In all, 68 000 birds will be
culled though no virus has been discovered among them, Semerad said.
Approximately the same number of ill chickens has being liquidated
since this morning by the firefighters and soldiers at the poultry
farms in Kosorin and Netreby, east Bohemia, where the dangerous H5N1
strain has been detected.
According to the Czech Veterinary Administration, there is no danger
of a bird flu epidemic in the Czech Republic.
The 1st case of bird flu this year was detected on 20 Jun 2007, at
the Tisova farm, also east Bohemia. A week later, the H5N1 virus was
detected at another poultry farm, four kilometres away from Tisova.
