The Department of Agriculture has confirmed that over 400 carcasses of lambs were destroyed after they were found to have a disease that can be transmitted to people.

Veterinary inspectors detected the disease called sarcocystosis in lambs over several weeks, and carcasses were condemned before they entered the food chain.

The Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) explained that cases of people becoming infected with the sarcocystis parasite are more common in "cultures where raw meat is commonly eaten."

However, cases of infections among people are uncommon in Ireland. It is not listed with the Health Protection Surveillance Centre as a notifiable infectious disease.

It can cause symptoms such as nausea, stomachache, and diarrhoea, which vary widely depending on the number of cysts ingested. In many cases, it is benign with no obvious signs.

It is understood the outbreak has been linked back to the Donegal region. In many cases, the parasite can be passed on to sheep from contamination from dogs.

"Department veterinary inspectorate have condemned carcasses at a number of sheep slaughter plants over a number of weeks as being unfit for human consumption. The carcasses were excluded from the food chain.

"The animals have been traced, and the cause of the problem has been diagnosed by the Department Regional Laboratory as sarcocystosis," a spokesman for the Agriculture Department said.

Each year, dozens of sheep attacks and incidents of worrying (attacking, killing, or chasing livestock) occur throughout Ireland, and the damage to a farmer's flock can be catastrophic, as well the associated financial impact and emotional distress.

A spokesman said there is a comprehensive system of inspections both prior to slaughter and after slaughter at Irish meat plants. "Where animals fail to meet the required standards, they are excluded from the food chain," he said.

The cysts are visible to the eye on parts of the carcass and were identified by vets.

Rigorous food safety procedures are in place at the country's meat plants, with Ireland exporting an estimated 50 000 tonnes of sheep meat valued at EU 240 million [USD 269 million] last year [2016].

[Symptomatic _Sarcocystis_ spp. infection in humans is very rare. _Sarcocystis_ spp. is closely related to _Toxoplasma gondii_, with a similar life cycle, forming tissue cysts and excreting sporulated oocysts in the feces of infected animals. Serosurveys in humans are not helpful, as _Sarcocystis_ spp. and _T. gondii_ show extensive cross-reactivity.

An outbreak in travellers visiting the Tioman Island (Malaysia) in 2011-12 is unique (Esposito DH et al. and the Tioman Island Sarcocystosis Investigation Team. Acute muscular sarcocystosis: an international investigation among ill travelers returning from Tioman Island, Malaysia, 2011-2012. Clin Infect Dis. 2014;59:1401-10. doi: 10.1093/cid/ciu622). Infection of humans is through food and water contaminated with feces from sarcocystic-infected animals and ingestion of raw or undercooked meat from sarcocystic-infected animals.

Two recent reviews discuss human sarcocystis infections: (Harris VC et al. Human Extraintestinal Sarcocystosis: What We Know, and What We don't Know. Curr Infect Dis Rep. 2015;17:49. doi: 10.1007/s11908-015-0495-4; and Fayer R et al. Human infections with Sarcocystis species. Clin Microbiol Rev. 2015;28:295-311. doi: 10.1128/CMR.00113-14). - Mod.EP]

[Sarcocystosis infections in humans and animals are caused by single-celled protozoan parasites in the family of Sarcocystidae. Sarcocystis spp. have an obligatory 2-host life-cycle with a prey animal serving as the intermediate host and a predator serving as the definitive host. While most species are infective only to animals, humans can act as incidental intermediate hosts in a variety of spp., and as definitive hosts in 2 species, _S. suihominis_ and _S. bovihominis_.

Human muscular sarcocystosis infections tend to be rare, and intestinal infections are often asymptomatic or very mild. Because the parasite is transmitted either fecal-orally or by the ingestion of undercooked meat containing sarcocysts, transmission can be easily prevented by simple changes in hygienic practices.

The above and additional information on sarcocystis is available at https://web.stanford.edu/group/parasites/ParaSites2004/Sarcocystis/.

The European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) includes sarcocystis among the parasites reviewed, though it is not a notifiable parasite. In its last (December 2016) annual report, the following information is to be found:

"In 2015, as in the previous 2 years, Belgium was the only MS [member state] which provided information on sarcocystis in cattle. Of the 874 948 cattle samples tested at slaughter (meat inspection), 107 (0.012 percent) were positive, which is comparable with a prevalence of 0.010 percent reported in 2014, and 0.007 percent in 2013.

"Reports on sarcocystis prevalence in cattle are lacking in most of the European countries. In contrast to the very low prevalence of sarcocystis in the Belgian cattle, a countrywide survey performed in Hungary by conventional PCR and sequencing found 66 percent sarcocystis-positive cattle samples at slaughter (Hornok et al., 2015). High sarcocystis prevalence was also reported in Italy by Domenis et al. (2011), where sarcocystis by histological examination was found in 78.1 percent of the tested bovine animals."
