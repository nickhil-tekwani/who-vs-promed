Genome sequence analysis of the 1st human West Nile virus isolated in Italy
in 2009
---------------------------------------------------------
In 2009, 6 new human cases of West Nile neuroinvasive disease (WNND) were
identified in Veneto region, following the 6 cases already reported in
2008. A human West Nile virus (WNV) isolate was obtained for the 1st time
from an asymptomatic blood donor. Whole genome sequence of the human WNV
isolate showed close phylogenetic relatedness to the Italy-1998-WNV strain
and to other WNV strains recently isolated in Europe, with the new
acquisition of the NS3-Thr249Pro mutation, a trait associated with avian
virulence, increased virus transmission, and the occurrence of outbreaks in
humans.

The reappearance of the mutation associated with increased virulence and
transmissibility again in 2009 is of concern. The close phylogenetic
relationship between the 2008 and 2009 WNV isolates leads one to speculate
that perhaps the virus with this mutation has become endemic in
northeastern Italy. It will be interesting to see what 2010 brings.
