Abstract
--------
Chronic wasting disease (CWD), a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy of cervids, remains prevalent in North American elk, white-tailed deer, and mule deer. A natural case of CWD in reindeer (_Rangifer tarandus tarandus_) has not been reported despite potential habitat overlap with CWD-infected deer or elk herds. This study investigates the experimental transmission of CWD from elk or white-tailed deer to reindeer by the oral route of inoculation. Ante-mortem testing of the 3 reindeer exposed to CWD from white-tailed deer identified the accumulation of pathological PrP (PrPCWD) in the recto-anal mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (RAMALT) of 2 reindeer at 13.4 months post-inoculation. Terminal CWD occurred in the 2 RAMALT-positive reindeer at 18.5 and 20 months post-inoculation while one other reindeer in the white-tailed deer CWD inoculum group and none of the 3 reindeer exposed to elk CWD developed disease. Tissue distribution analysis of PrPCWD in CWD-affected reindeer revealed widespread deposition in central and peripheral nervous systems, lymphoreticular tissues, the gastrointestinal tract, neuroendocrine tissues and cardiac muscle. Analysis of prion protein gene (PRNP) sequences in the 6 reindeer identified polymorphisms at residues 2 (V/M), 129 (G/S), 138 (S/N), and 169 (V/M). These findings demonstrate that (i) a sub-population of reindeer are susceptible to CWD by oral inoculation implicating the potential for transmission to other _Rangifer_ species, and (ii) certain reindeer _PRNP_ polymorphisms may be protective against CWD infection.

Discussion
----------
The current study demonstrates the oral transmission of CWD from the brain tissues of infected white-tailed deer to reindeer (_Rangifer tarandus tarandus_). Antemortem testing identified PrPCWD in 2 reindeer at 13.4 mpi and both animals manifested consistent clinical signs and succumbed to disease by 20 months. The course of disease progression and widespread distribution of PrPCWD in nervous and lymphoreticular systems are consistent with observations from other cervids naturally or experimentally infected with CWD, including elk, white-tailed deer, mule deer, moose, and red deer. A natural case of CWD in reindeer or caribou has not yet been identified but given the potential overlap in habitat with infected free-ranging cervid populations and the current findings of oral transmissibility, the potential for natural transmission certainly exists.

[While the research may be groundbreaking, I cannot help but wonder why the researchers chose brain over other infectious material, such as lymphoid tissues. I wonder this because in some observations deer, and presumably those cervids called reindeer may be more likely to eat lymphoid tissue of killed and gutted animals than brain tissue. - Mod.TG]
