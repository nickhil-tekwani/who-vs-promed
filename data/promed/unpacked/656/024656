[1] Thailand ex China, suspected

The discovery of a new type of bird flu virus in Thailand has prompted
officials to ponder prevention and control measures to prevent further
spread of the disease.
A new type of the H5N1 strain has been confirmed in Nakhon Phanom, where
over 300 000 chickens have died or been culled as a result of widespread
infections, according to Yong Poovorawan, team leader of virologists
monitoring changes in the virus since 2004.
The strain has a genetic character close to that of the virus in southern
China, he said, adding that virologists were still unsure how it crossed
the border from there into Thailand.
There are 4 types of the H5N1 virus in the region: the so-called
Thai-Vietnamese type, the Indonesian type, and another 2 types occurring in
China. The Thai-Vietnamese type has plagued Thailand since official
confirmation of the 1st outbreak in early 2004.
The virologist said the impact of the new strain on human health was so far
no different from that of the Thai-Vietnamese type. But he warned officials
to pay attention if they wanted to develop human vaccines which can tackle
both types of the virus strain.
"We now have 2 types of bird flu strain in the country. The new one may not
yet have any significance in terms of its health impact but it certainly
has significance for our control measures, which might have to improve to
cope with its emergence," he said.
Livestock Development Department chief Yukol Limlamthong said the agency
would beef up controls on fowl movements between area zones, and he called
on poultry raisers to tighten their bio-security measures.
Director of the Epidemiology Bureau Kumnuan Ungchusak said scientists
needed to be aware of every bird flu type emerging here, so human vaccines
could be developed.
But health officials would not strengthen bird flu control measures among
humans as the present regime was already intensive, Dr Kumnuan said. Sick
people found to be in close contact with ailing fowls would be listed as
suspect cases, he said.
Meanwhile, the National Institute of Animal Health has confirmed the
success of a vaccine prototype for fowls. Director Pornchai Chamnanpood
said complete vaccine production which could pave the way for commercial
use would be accomplished by February 2007. [From this information it might
be concluded that the Thai authorities consider a change in their
non-vaccination policy; see also [3] "Thailand, unauthorised vaccination"
and the related commentary in archived 20060812.2266. - Mod.AS].
Thailand is now in the 4th outbreak round, which has killed 2 people, one
each in Phichit and Uthai Thani. Since the 1st round, more than 60 million
fowls have been culled and 16 people have died [out of 24 confirmed human
cases, according to WHO's statistics. - Mod.AS].

Unfortunately this newspaper report provides no indication of the extent of
the genetic divergence of the 4 strains of H5N1 virus now circulating in
South Asia and beyond. The term strain rather than type should be used to
describe these viruses to avoid confusion with antigenic type (i.e. H5N1).
The existence of 4 distinguishable strains may have implications for the
design and production of vaccine for control of animal (and human) disease,
if the genetic variation of the 4 strains involves changes in the antigenic
properties of the haemagglutinin and neuraminidase surface proteins of the
virus. The statements in the report can be interpreted to mean that no
enhanced potential for production of illness in the human population has
been observed so far. More precise information is awaited.

A Chinese strain of bird flu never seen before in Thailand or Laos has been
partly responsible for recent flare-ups in those countries with smuggled
poultry likely to blame, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO]
said Thursday [17 Aug 2006].
The new strain, the same found in southern China, was confirmed in poultry
outbreaks that occurred in July 2006 in the northeastern Thai province of
Nakhon Phanom and the Laotian capital of Vientiane, the FAO in Bangkok said
in a statement.
"We are aware that there is a lot of trade still going on, mainly
smuggling, of course, of chicken and poultry products," said Diderik de
Vleeschauwer, FAO spokesman in Bangkok. "The movement and trade of animals
and poultry products is the main reason for the spreading of disease."
He added that migratory birds are not to blame because they are not on the
move in Southeast Asia this time of year. The strain also is unique to
southern China and had not previously been found elsewhere, de Vleeschauwer
said.
The samples have been sent to an international reference laboratory in
Australia for further analysis. FAO also warned countries in the region to
step up awareness and surveillance as more outbreaks surface in other
countries.
"Continuing outbreaks in China, recurrence in Cambodia, Laos and Thailand,
and the steady march of the disease in Indonesia, underline the need for
heightened vigilance in other Asian countries," He Changchui, FAO's
regional representative for the Asia-Pacific, said in a statement.
Bird flu re-emerged in Thailand in July for the 1st time in 2006, and Laos
reported its 1st outbreak in more than 2 years. The virus killed 2 people
in Thailand as the government raced to slaughter birds in the affected areas.

A total of 1805 ducks have died at a farm in Changsha, capital of Hunan
province, since the 1st poultry death was reported on 4 Aug 2006, Xinhuanet
quoted the agriculture ministry as saying.
About 217 000 ducks at the farm have been culled, Xinhuanet said.
A national laboratory confirmed on Monday the ducks had died from the H5N1
bird flu virus, it said.
About 40 bird flu outbreaks in poultry have been reported in a dozen
Chinese provinces in the past year.
On Monday [14 Aug 2006], the Health Ministry said a 62-year-old farmer from
Jimsar county in the northwestern region of Xinjiang died on 12 Jul 2006
from the H5N1 strain, bringing the nationwide bird flu death toll to 14.
It was 21st human case of bird flu in China.
