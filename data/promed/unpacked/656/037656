According to Washington State University, both the Western X phytoplasma and Little cherry virus-2 are well into epidemic levels across the state. The incidence in individual orchards varies considerably, from a few trees to 100 per cent incidence. The only good news is that Little cherry virus-1 continues to be rare, which may be due to the absence of an insect vector. Western X is the major cause of cherry disease in the Columbia basin. Little cherry virus-2, while present, is not very common. The opposite occurs as you head north, where Little cherry virus-2 is the most common, with lower incidence of Western X.

It will take a concerted approach of management of vectors, removal of infected trees, and replacement of removed plantings from pathogen-free sources. It's also going to take a community-based approach [for] people to coordinate with their neighbors to identify and remove infected trees, and ensure to check the replacement planting stock.

[Little cherry
-------------
Little cherry disease (LCD) is a serious problem for sweet and sour cherry producers in parts of northern Europe and North America. It can be caused by 2 closteroviruses, _Little cherry virus 1_ (LChV-1, not yet assigned to a genus) and LChV-2 (genus _Ampelovirus_), in single or mixed infections. Symptoms vary with host cultivars, but may include reduced size and quality of fruit, premature leaf reddening, stunting of seedlings, and some loss of tree vigour and yield. All commercial cherry cultivars are susceptible, and ornamental flowering cherries can be asymptomatic reservoirs of LChV-1.

An insect vector for LChV-1 is not known. LChV-2 is transmitted by at least one species of mealybugs, which can be spread by wind and with packing material in their nymph stages. Both viruses can be spread by both shoot and root grafting and with infected plant material. Disease management for LCD includes use of certified clean planting stock and budwood, elimination of inoculum (removal of infected trees), and vector control for LChV-2.

X disease
---------
Phytoplasmas of the 16SrIII taxonomic group cause X diseases (such as Western-X, Canada-X) of stone fruit (_Prunus_ spp). Symptoms and host specificity differ for members of the group. X-disease symptoms in cherry (also called cherry buckskin) vary with the cultivar and rootstock combinations, but are often similar to the viral LCD. Phytoplasmas can be spread by sap sucking insects (mostly leaf hoppers), grafting, with contaminated tools (such as during pruning of trees), and with tissue cultures. They survive in asymptomatic crop hosts or non-crop reservoir species. Disease management of phytoplasmas is difficult and generally includes vector control, removal of infected plants and other sources of inoculum, as well as the use of certified clean planting and propagating material. Such measures require reliable molecular diagnostic methods and coordinated efforts on a regional scale (as mentioned above), especially when dealing with a long-lived tree crop.

Another member of 16SrIII has been shown to be associated with frog skin disease of cassava (for example see ProMED-mail post 20071130.3864).
