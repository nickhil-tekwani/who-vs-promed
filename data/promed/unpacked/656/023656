High _Fusarium_ levels in some wheat regions
---------------------------------------------
Latest wheat ear disease monitoring results have highlighted regional
variations in levels of the toxin-forming ear blight _Fusarium
graminearum_, says the HGCA [Home Grown Cereals Association].
_Fusarium_ head blight (FHB) levels in wheat crops are high this year
[2007], although the survey results suggest that this is largely
caused by non-toxin producing species.
However, 30 percent of samples were found to contain the
toxin-forming _Fusarium graminearum_, with fields in the East
Midlands and the south west of England being particularly hard hit.
Levels of _F. graminearum_ in these regions are 3 times higher than
in other parts of the country. Farmers are warned that lodged crops
are even more at risk from having raised mycotoxin levels and
harvesting should be carried out as soon as possible.
All the samples in the Defra [Department for Environment, Food and
Rural Affairs]/HGCA-funded winter wheat survey, underpinning
CropMonitor [HGCA disease level information website], have now been
assessed and more than 90 percent showed symptoms of FHB. This level
is by far the highest seen since ear assessments began in 1986; the
previous high was recorded in 1998 when 61 percent of samples showed
FHB symptoms. The overall profile of species isolated is similar to
that seen in 1998.
Results indicate that the predominant species present are
_Microdochium_ species -- _M. nivale_ and _M. majus_ -- both of which
are non-toxin producers. These species were isolated from 75 percent
of samples, with an average of 7 percent ears affected per sample.
_Fusarium poae_ was the next most frequently isolated species present
in 58 percent of samples, with an average of 3 percent of ears
affected.
As levels of deoxynivalenol (DON) were low in 1998, it seems likely
that overall DON contamination of grain this year [2007] is also
likely to be low, says the HGCA. According to Roger Williams, HGCA's
assistant director of research, growers should not assume that
fusarium mycotoxins will be a widespread problem. However, he says
that toxin levels may be raised if crops are lodged or harvest is
delayed. As levels of _Microdochium_ species are high, there is an
increased need for seed testing and subsequently for appropriate seed
treatment to control _Microdochium_ species. Growers can monitor the
latest information on the risk of _Fusarium_ mycotoxins at:
<http://www.cropmonitor.co.uk>.
Nickerson [a European plant breeding and seed development company]
plant pathologist Paul Fenwick says the UK has the ideal climate for
_Fusarium_. "The risk is heightened in mixed cropping areas where
maize is grown as the maize trash carries the inoculum over into the
following wheat. The warning sign is showery or unsettled weather
around flowering, and if ever a season could be called unsettled,
2007 is surely the one," he says.
Nickerson cereal product manager Lee Robinson says that while
_Fusarium_ was an issue for all wheats, it was of particular concern
for quality wheat growers. "Whatever the variety, we would advise
growers who have concerns about _Fusarium_ levels in their wheat this
season to put it over a screen to remove small, shrivelled grains
before submitting a sample to buyers," he says .

[Fusarium head blight (FHB; also known as scab) on wheat is caused by
several fungal species originally classed into the genus _Fusarium_,
accounting for the common name of this disease. Although some have
since been re-assigned to different genera, the common name remains
in use. Current names of the fungi mentioned above are _Gibberella
zeae_ (previously _Fusarium graminearum_); _Fusarium poae_;
_Monographella nivalis_ var. _nivalis_ (previously _Microdochium
nivale_, synonym _Fusarium nivale_); and _Microdochium majus_.
FHB causes yield losses of up to 45 percent, reduces the grade of
harvested grain, and it may also contaminate the grain with fungal
toxins (mycotoxins; for example deoxynivalenol (DON), also known as
vomitoxin which can affect stock). FHB is favoured by humid
conditions during flowering and early stages of kernel development.
Symptoms are premature bleaching of infected spikelets and the
production of orange, spore-bearing structures at the base of the
glumes. During wet weather, there may be whitish, occasionally
pinkish, fluffy fungal growth on infected heads in the field.
Diseased spikelets can contain visibly affected kernels. The grading
term given to visibly affected wheat seeds is 'fusarium damaged
kernels.'
FHB can also affect barley, oats, rye, maize and some grasses
worldwide. Pathogens affecting these hosts may be different
phylogenetic species or strains which are often limited to particular
regions of the world. For more information on FHB on these hosts and
on vomitoxin see ProMED-mail post number 20070621.2000.
The term 'lodging' refers to the collapse of cereal stems making
grain harvest difficult. Lodging may be due to, for example, wind,
rain pressure, or the extra weight of filled ears.
