Agriculture authorities will test their biosecurity systems for exotic
animal disease this week with a SIMULATED outbreak of the highly virulent
Newcastle disease in poultry.
New Zealand has no Newcastle disease, but the annual training exercise from
today [26 Mar to Saturday will pretend there are high death rates in
poultry flocks around South Auckland. The Ministry of Agriculture and
Forestry (MAF), AgriQuality NZ, the Poultry Industry Association, and the
Egg Producers Federation will work to identify and contain the "outbreak".
Details of the exercise will not be released until the start of the
exercise, so poultry farmers and officials do not know how it will unfold.
The disease is often spread through dust contaminated with feces from
infected birds, and the virus may be carried about by humans and equipment,
although wild birds can also be involved.
A field operations response team will be based at Pukekohe, and field teams
will work at "infected places" with poultry industry staff. An exotic
disease response center will be set up at MAF's national center for disease
investigation at Wallaceville, near Wellington. The response center will
analyze information from field workers, make recommendations on control and
containment measures, such as road blocks, and direct field teams. A
national control center will operate from MAF's head office.
