The city of Aurora said a number of ducks died last month [August
2011] due to botulism outbreaks at a couple of parks.

Jenna Katsaros, spokeswoman for Aurora Parks, Recreation & Open Space,
said a number of ducks were found dead at Utah Park and Expo Park.
Katsaros said 40 ducks were found dead in the final 2 weeks of August
[2011] at Utah Park. Laboratory tests determined that the waterfowl
died from avian botulism.

Several dozen ducks were found dead by the same disease at nearby Expo
Park in August [2011] as well.

The ponds in both of the parks are storm water retention ponds.
Katsaros said the ponds serve to mitigate any flooding in the adjacent
neighborhoods.

Avian botulism is not an uncommon occurrence during the summer months
in the Denver metro area. Angela Casias of Denver Parks and Recreation
said Denver sees several cases of the disease but not any major
outbreaks. "They usually happen in super hot weather," Casias said.

Casias said that if sick birds are reported to the department in time,
it is possible to treat them before the bacterial infection becomes
fatal. "When we were able to get to the sick birds when they were sick
rather than before they died, there was a 98 percent survival rate for
them," she said. The stricken ducks are put on a regimen of
antibiotics to cure them. After they are given a clean bill of health,
they are released back at the park again, Casias said. [How
interesting that antibiotics are working. Antibiotics can kill the
organism responsible for botulism but it does not affect the toxin.
Botulism is a toxin. So one wonders at what level of illness are they
getting to these birds to treat them. - Mod.TG]

Katsaros said a contributing factor to the 2 outbreaks of avian
botulism was park visitors feeding the birds. She said feeding any
park animals can lead to unhealthy congregations of animals at the
park. If the animals know they can get handouts at a park, they are
less likely to leave. "That concentrates their feces and all of this
creates conditions for botulism to occur," Katsaros said.

According to the US Fish and Wildlife Service, there have only been a
handful of cases where people or dogs have contracted avian botulism.
