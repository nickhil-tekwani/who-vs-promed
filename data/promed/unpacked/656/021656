RINDERPEST IN TURKEY
The Delegate declares the Thrace region "provisionally free" from the disease
Text of a fax received on 3 November 1998 from Dr Celal Ozcan, General
Director of Protection and Control, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Affairs, Ankara:
After a 22-year period of freedom from rinderpest, an outbreak of the
disease commenced in the south-eastern part of Turkey, in the Van and
Hakkari provinces, in October 1991 (see Disease Information, 4 [43], 139,
dated 31 October 1991). This was the first occurrence of rinderpest in
Turkey since 1969. The last outbreak was recorded at Diyarbakir in January
1996 (see Disease Information, 9 [2], 7, dated 19 January 1996). No
outbreaks have been reported since 1996.
Vaccination campaigns have been conducted every year to protect the animal
population in the whole country since rinderpest was seen in Turkey in
1991. For serological evaluation and rinderpest antibody assay after each
round of vaccination in the whole country, sero-monitoring has been carried
out. The epizootic was controlled by the necessary control measures, such
as destroying sick and in-contact animals with compensation of owners,
animal movement controls, vaccination and surveillance, etc.
In order to reach national eradication as well as global rinderpest
eradication, Turkey has followed the OIE "pathway" since 1991. Considering
the geographical and epidemiological situation, it is convenient to apply
zonal freedom from rinderpest to Turkey and to apply the necessary measures
within the zones. We now declare the Thrace region "provisionally free"
from rinderpest. In Thrace region, vaccination against rinderpest ceased on
1 January 1998.
