Brucellosis has been found in a Madison County [Montana] cow within the state's Designated Surveillance Area [DSA], according to the state's lead animal health official.

State veterinarian Dr. Marty Zaluksi with the Montana Department of Livestock said results of cultures confirming the infection were received earlier today from the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa. "It's unfortunate. We obviously don't like finding brucellosis in our cattle, but the silver lining is that the program we've invested so much time and effort in is working," Zaluski said. "The infected cow was found quickly and didn't leave the DSA."

The state will not lose its Brucellosis Class Free Status, Zaluski said, as the US Department of Agriculture's [USDA] brucellosis program is currently operating under an interim rule that de-emphasizes class status and directs states to focus on surveillance.

The cow was found in a herd of about 1000 head, which are currently quarantined and undergoing a whole-herd test. In previous brucellosis-affected herds, the rate of infection has been extremely low -- around 1 percent, Zaluski said.

"Fact is, we're finding it, we're finding it early, and we're not letting infected animals make it to market," Zaluski said. "We've got a good program that works well for our producers and keeps infected animals from entering interstate commerce." Governor Steve Bullock said the state has been aggressive in developing and implementing a "practical and workable" brucellosis plan.

"When brucellosis was found in 2007 for the 1st time in 22 years, it was a real wake-up call," Bullock said. "The livestock industry is a vital component of our economy, and as an export state, we had to reassure our trade partners that we're serious about managing brucellosis and eliminating risks to other states. "Brucellosis risk management is a collective effort. We've got everyone involved -- the departments of Livestock and Fish, Wildlife and Parks, the state legislature, USDA-APHIS [Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service], ranchers and hunters."

[The ranch is located within the state's Designated Surveillance Area (DSA), a disease management area involving Beaverhead, Gallatin, Madison and Park counties, with management practices that include Official Calfhood Vaccination as required by DSA rules and a herd plan. USDA has de-emphasized state status and now manages brucellosis on a case-by-case basis.

The last post we had of bovine brucellar reactors [20111118.3396] was also in Madison County.

Getting rid of that last brucellar reactor is always hard work. I think the last reactor we had in Louisiana was in an animal that went to market, was routinely tested, and found positive. It had come from a herd that had been closed for some 16 years, nothing in, nothing out. The problem is made harder in Montana because of the background of occasional reactors found in the bison and elk populations. Ted Turner, a significant bison rancher in Montana, supports an aggressive bleeding and testing of his thousands of plains bison. We reported a single reactor, a bull bison in 2011 [20111204.3528], also in Madison County. The elk prevalence has been estimated at 3-5 percent; locally it can be higher, e.g., 12 percent. As the elk live on high ground it is hard and expensive to dart, bleed, and then work out what to do when any are found positive.

Another complication is that at very low prevalences false positives rear their ugly and expensive heads. - Mod.MHJ
