Thank you for your post. In regards to moderator LL's comment, we are in agreement. Although we are in the midst of an ongoing outbreak investigation, we can provide a brief update. More information will be forthcoming about pathogen testing. To date, testing has been indicative of fecal contamination of the well. We are in the process of collecting and testing stool specimens from ill persons using laboratory techniques to identify multiple bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens. Preliminary findings indicate that norovirus is one pathogen contributing to illness. This is consistent with the early epidemiological analyses of symptomology, incubation time, and duration of illness. Investigation into other possible etiologies and sources of transmission including the potential contribution of waterborne, person-to-person, and fomite transmission will continue. The venue has been cooperative and immediately complied with health department requests for patron contact information and interventions including switching to bottled water.
