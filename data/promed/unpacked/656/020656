A ray of hope has been offered for one of the UK's most iconic and
endangered animals. Scientists have found that some red squirrels
have developed immunity to a disease that has ravaged their numbers.

The pox is transmitted by grey squirrels, but while greys suffer no
ill effects from it, if a red catches the virus it will be dead within weeks.

The findings, published in EcoHealth, suggest a vaccine could now
help to save red squirrels from annihilation.

Grey squirrels were 1st introduced to the UK from North America in
the late 19th century. As the grey squirrels increased their range,
red squirrels have suffered huge population declines and now exist in
just a few pockets around the British Isles.

Conservationists estimate that there are only 211 000 red squirrels
left in the UK (with approximately 100 000 in Scotland), compared
with more than 2.7 million greys.

Grey squirrels act as a reservoir for squirrel poxvirus; they are
able to carry the disease without suffering from any ill effects. But
this is not the case for red squirrels.

Tony Sainsbury, from the Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of
London, who is the lead author of the paper, said: "Squirrel pox is
almost always fatal in red squirrels. We are not sure exactly how it
kills them; we think it must have some sort of effect on the heart or
another vital organ, because it can kill them very quickly." He said
that the pox was having a devastating effect on red squirrel
populations, causing numbers to plummet 25 times faster than in areas
where greys did not carry the virus.

David Stapleford, a red squirrel breeder at Pensthorpe Nature
Reserve, Norfolk said: "The pox annihilates the red."

But this latest study suggests the reds may be fighting back.

Dr Sainsbury and his colleagues were testing fluid samples taken from
500 squirrels that had been brought to the Institute of Zoology for
autopsies between 1993 and 2005 to investigate how the pox was
spreading. However, as the team screened them for antibodies to the
virus, the researchers discovered something extremely interesting. He
told the BBC: "Up to now, we have never found antibodies to the virus
in the red squirrels. So it appeared that whenever red squirrels were
exposed to the virus, they were getting the disease and dying. But
when we looked at these samples, we found there were 8 squirrels that
had antibodies to the virus. They must have been exposed at some
point to the virus and either didn't develop the disease or developed
the disease and managed to fight it." This, he said, was the 1st
evidence that red squirrels might have some immunity and would be
able to counteract the disease.

The team is now planning to look at how widespread this immunity
might be and to investigate why and how the red squirrels have been
able to develop this ability to resist the pox. The findings suggest
that a vaccine could now be a viable way to save the reds.

Dr Sainsbury said: "While developing a vaccine would take years and a
lot of investment, this study gives us an idea that there is a good
chance of a vaccine working because we now know that reds can develop
immunity."

[Squirrel pox is a viral disease affecting red squirrels, killing
them within 15 days of infection. It is carried by grey squirrels,
which show no symptoms of disease, so that they continue to thrive
and breed while carrying the virus. It is thought to have been
brought into Britain with grey squirrels introduced into southern
England from America in the early 20th century. Several pox-like
disease outbreaks in red squirrels were recorded over the decades,
but the virus was 1st confirmed during a disease outbreak in East
Anglia in the 1980s, and it has since worked its way steadily northwards.
