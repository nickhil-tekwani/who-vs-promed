[1] Cholera - South Sudan (Eastern Equatoria State)

An outbreak of cholera that has killed at least 118 people is declining in the South Sudanese capital but continues to spread in the town of Torit to the east, according to the South Sudan Red Cross. The UN says that nationwide there have been 5459 cases as of 30 Jul 2014, with a case fatality rate of 2.16 percent.

"Despite the decline in cholera cases in Juba where the 1st cases of cholera were reported, the disease continues to spread to other states," the Red Cross said in an article published on its website on Thu 31 Jul 2014. Marial Mayom, writing for the South Sudan Red Cross noted, "Most new cases are being reported in Torit, Eastern Equatoria, 150 kilometers [93 mi] east of Juba and close to South Sudan's border with Uganda."

The UN coordination office says the cholera outbreak is hard to control. In an update on Fri 1 Aug 2014 the UN said, "Early detection and prevention of new cases in Eastern Equatoria State remains a challenge because many communities are distant from health units and social mobilization activities."

The South Sudan Red Cross says its has trained 45 volunteers in Torit to spread health messages and to distribute oral rehydration salts, purification tablets and soap. They are also showing videos in public places to educate people on how to they can protect themselves from cholera.

Philip Marchelo, the South Sudan Red Cross branch director in Eastern Equatoria said, "I am appealing to the partners to support us particularly during the ongoing operation to curb the cholera outbreak in the state.''

[2] Cholera - Burundi (Bururi Province)

At least 86 persons have caught cholera and one of them has already died in less than 2 weeks when cholera broke out in the Burundian town of Rumonge in the province of Bururi, some 70 km [43.5 mi] south of the Burundian capital Bujumbura, the director of Rumonge Hospital told Xinhua by phone on Sun 3 Aug 2014. "For less than 2 weeks, at least 86 persons from Rumonge neighborhoods came to hospital with cholera symptoms and 1 of them has died," said Dr Lambert Bigirindavyi, Director of Rumonge Hospital.

According to Bigirindavyi, drugs and equipment to control drugs are a "big challenge" because the stock is almost empty. He commended the UNICEF and the Burundi Red Cross for availing drugs and the equipment but called on both organizations and other organizations to provide more medical assistance to control cholera.

Bigirindavyi said, "A week ago cholera was declared in Rumonge town in 2 neighborhoods including Iteba and Nkayamba, but it has now expanded to 6 neighborhoods namely Iteba, Nkayamba, the Swahili neighborhood, Kagongo, Ihwanya, and Nyakarara. "He indicated that 27 cholera patients are still in isolation tents at Rumonge Hospital and added that other people who had cholera have gone back home because they were healed.

On 20 Jun 2014, Burundian Public Health and AIDS Control Minister Dr Sabine Ntakarutimana officially declared a cholera outbreak in some parts of the east African country's western lowlands.

The town of Rumonge, which is Burundi's 4th biggest town after the capital Bujumbura, Gitega, and Ngozi, had also been warned to be watchful about cholera attack.

[3] Cholera - Cameroon (Extreme North Province)
Date: Sat 2 Aug 2014

A cholera epidemic in northern Cameroon has killed at least 65 people and probably infected about 1300 people in 2 months, as international attention has been diverted to fighting Ebola in West Africa, health experts said on Sat 2 Aug 2014. They said the insurgency by Islamist sect Boko Haram was also hampering efforts to control the outbreak.

Some 185 suspected cholera cases were recorded last week alone in the outbreak focused on the Mogode, Hina, and Bourha districts on the turbulent Nigerian border. The death toll is expected to climb as more cases are confirmed by laboratory testing. Atilio Rivera-Vasquez, public health adviser in the region for International Medical Corps, said Cameroonian health authorities were diverting resources to impose checks at border crossing and airports for Ebola, after it killed more than 700 people in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. "This is distracting from an appropriate and fast response to this cholera epidemic," Rivera-Vasquez said.

He added that the violent activities of Boko Haram in neighboring northern Nigeria partly explained why the outbreak was not being brought under control.

Cameroon has some 100 000 double-doses of an oral cholera vaccine that showed high efficacy in a 2012 trial in Guinea. However, insecurity in the north has deterred the government from immunizing. The cholera outbreak has shown a worrying increase in mortality in the last few months, he said, rising to 4.8 percent or more than double the 2 percent maximum cited in WHO guidelines.

Julian Schlubach, from the European Union's aid agency, ECHO, said the situation was alarming because the rainy season -- the worst time for cholera -- still lay ahead.

The 1st 3 cases in Cameroon were reported in late April [2014] in the Far North region after a Nigerian family crossed the border to receive treatment. The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) said some 60 000 refugees have fled into Cameroon, Niger, and Chad from northern Nigeria, where fighting between the government and Boko Haram has killed thousands in the last 6 months. Some of them are carrying the disease.

"People in northern Nigeria cannot get to health clinics in time due to the awful security situation and that's one reason why they come across the very porous border where they have family or tribal ties," said Rivera-Vasquez. Some 24 683 cholera cases have been reported in Nigeria since the beginning of 2014, according to the Assessment Capacities Project, a consortium of international NGOs which check humanitarian needs in emergencies and crises.

In Cameroon, a country of 22 million people, outbreaks of the disease cause alarm because of poor sanitary conditions, particularly in rural areas. According to a 2011 government survey, 54 percent of rural households have only cesspools or open holes, whilst 50 percent use drinking water from unprotected wells or surface water.

A similar outbreak in Cameroon killed more than 4000 people in 2011/12. The current outbreak is the first major epidemic since then.

[4] Cholera - Nigeria (Borno State)

The Borno State Commissioner for Health, Dr Salma Anas Kolo, yesterday said 27 persons had so far died of cholera in one of the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) camps in Biu. The commissioner who spoke on phone from Biu where she had proceeded from Maiduguri to monitor the case of cholera outbreak in 1 of the 2 camps established by the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) for over 10 000 displaced persons from Damboa, said 16 persons died in the camp and 11 others died at the hospital where they were taken to for treatment. She also revealed that the total number of cholera cases at the camp came to about 375 with about 30 of them hospitalised.

The commissioner narrated that the victims contacted the disease as a result of the poor hygienic condition at the camp, adding that the state government in conjunction with UNICEF and the Red Cross had moved in to improve the condition in the camp and equally provided medical services.

To prevent further spread of water borne diseases, Anas-Kolo said: "Antiseptics for disinfecting all possible sources of infection have also been supplied for distribution to the resettlement camps that holds over 10 000 displaced persons from Damboa and its environs.

[5] Shigellosis - Egypt (South Sinai Governorate), resort, UK travelers

[Poor hygiene and shigellosis] have been blamed for a sickness sweeping the 4-star Coral Sea Waterworld complex in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt. Up to 100 British tourists have fallen ill at the Egyptian holiday resort. Several were still on intravenous drips in their hotel rooms last night [2 Aug 2014].

Angry holidaymakers blamed the virulent bug on dirty buffet food containers, utensils and tables, and poor hygiene. It has spread so fast that resort bosses have had to draft in extra doctors to cope with the sickness outbreak.
