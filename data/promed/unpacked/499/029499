Thailand says its avian flu battle is over
------------------------------------------
After an arduous 10-month battle against the H5N1 avian influenza
virus, Thailand has declared itself free of the disease, the Bangkok
Post reported today.

The country hasn't identified a human case of H5N1 infection since
the death last October [2004] of a 14-year-old girl in Sukhothai
province, but poultry outbreaks had continued. Yesterday marked the
end of a 3-week surveillance period at a farm in Lop Buri, the last
place to have reported an H5N1 outbreak, the newspaper said.

This is the 1st time Thailand has been free of avian flu since the
disease re-emerged last July [2004], officials told the Post. The
Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives will continue to watch for
any re-emergence of the virus, said ministry assistant Charal
Trinvuthipong. Officials will continue to conduct bi-weekly checks
for avian flu.

In addition, the ministry has recruited more than 600 temporary
workers to watch for avian flu. They will work in 9 northern and
central provinces where H5N1 kept reappearing: Ang Thong, Lop Buri,
Kampheng Phet, Nakhon Sawan, Phichit, Phitsanulok, Sukhothai, Suphan
Buri, and Uttaradit, the Post reported.

Along with the surveillance, officials will seek closed-system
poultry-raising methods for small-scale farms, said Sudarat
Keyuraphan, agriculture and cooperatives minister.

The end of the outbreaks is good news for Thailand's poultry
industry. Chicken exports are expected to reach a target of 300 000
tons this year [2005], Anan Sirimongkolkasem, president of the Thai
Broiler Processing Exporters Association, told the Post in a separate
story today. That's nearly a 40 percent increase over [2004].

Thailand is chiefly shipping cooked products because raw poultry
remains banned in major export markets, he said.

[Since the 1st ("emergency") report from Thailand on the diagnosis of
Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, type H5N1, on 23 Jan 2004, the
said country has meticulously sent follow-up reports to the OIE,
almost on a weekly basis. The last report pertaining to new
outbreaks, namely follow-up report No 51, was sent on 12 Apr 2005. It
referred to 3 new outbreaks, of which 2 were in Suphan Buri province
and 1 in Lop Buri province. The later reports, 52 and 53 (29 Apr and
6 May 2005, respectively), announced the absence of new cases.

OIE's last update (6 May 2005) of the HPAI H5N1 panzootic, which
initially begun in Dec 2003, including the number of accumulated
outbreaks in each country, provides the following figures: Cambodia
(15), China (50), Hong Kong (4), Indonesia (207), Japan (5), S.Korea
(19), Laos (1), Malaysia (10), Thailand (1092) and Viet Nam (1837).
Of these, 3 countries have already sent their final reports to the
OIE, in which they notified their regained freedom from HPAI: Japan
(on 13 Jul 2004), S. Korea (on 24 Sep 2004) and Malaysia (on 4 Jan
2005). This was done in line with article 2.7.12.2. of OIE's
Terrestrial Animal Health Code.

According to the said article, a country may be considered free from HPAI
when it has been shown that HPAI has not been present for at least the past
3 years; [or] 6 months after the slaughter of the last affected animal for
countries in which a stamping-out policy is practiced with or without
vaccination against HPAI. The above 3 countries applied stamping-out and
refrained from vaccinating. Thailand has adopted the same policy, and will
be able to declare its HPAI-free status under the said time-table. - Mod.AS]
