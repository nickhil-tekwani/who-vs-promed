Update number 349 (based on data up to 18 Aug 2019)
---------------------------------------------------
Information in this report is categorized by influenza transmission zones, which are geographical groups of countries, areas or territories with similar influenza transmission patterns.
Summary
-------
- In the temperate zones of the southern hemisphere, influenza activity continued to decrease in most countries.
- In the Caribbean, Central American, and tropical South American countries, influenza activity was low overall.
- In tropical Africa, influenza activity was low across reporting countries, with the exception of a few countries in Western and Eastern Africa.
- In Southern Asia, influenza activity was low across reporting countries except in Bhutan where influenza percent positivity was reported above alert threshold.
- In South East Asia, influenza activity was low in most reporting countries and remained elevated in Myanmar.
- In the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere, influenza activity remained at inter-seasonal levels.
- Worldwide, seasonal influenza A viruses accounted for the majority of detections.

National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 96 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from 5 Aug 2019 to 18 Aug 2019 (data as of 30 Aug 2019 04:12:36 UTC). The WHO GISRS [Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System] laboratories tested more than 37 252 specimens during that time period. 2823 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 1698 (60.1 percent) were typed as influenza A and 1125 (39.9 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 461 (31.3 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 1014 (68.7 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 51 (8.4 percent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 555 (91.6 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

Australian Influenza Surveillance Report no. 9 -- week ending 26 Aug 2019
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Key messages
------------
- Activity: Currently, overall influenza and influenza-like illness (ILI) activity is lower than average for this time of year compared to previous years, and current activity is consistent with activity in previous years following a peak. At the national level, notifications of laboratory-confirmed influenza continued to decrease in the past fortnight following an apparent peak in early July [2019].
- Severity: Clinical severity for the season to date, as measured through the proportion of patients admitted directly to ICU, and deaths attributed to influenza, is considered low.
- Impact: Impact for the season to date, as measured through the number of sentinel hospital beds occupied by patients with influenza and the rate of Flutracking respondents absent from normal duties, is considered to be low to moderate.
- Virology: The majority of confirmed influenza cases reported nationally were influenza A in the year to date (79.5%) and reporting fortnight (70.7 percent). Of the influenza A cases that were subtyped, there has been a higher proportion of influenza A(H3N2) compared to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. The proportion of cases attributed to influenza B has increased slightly in the past fortnight, following a steady decline during July.
- Vaccine match and effectiveness: Antigenic analysis of circulating influenza viruses in Australia in 2019 shows that the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B/Yamagata-lineage viruses are well matched to the 2019 influenza vaccine while some A(H3N2) and B/Victoria-lineage viruses are less well matched. Overall vaccine effectiveness appears good and as expected based on preliminary estimates from sentinel general practice (ASPREN) and sentinel hospital (FluCAN-PAEDS) surveillance systems, noting that effectiveness typically ranges from around 40-60 percent) each year.
