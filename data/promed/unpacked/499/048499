Diarrhea-Related Death Toll Rises to 770 in Bangladesh
The latest diarrhea-related death toll till Monday evening had risen to 770
since the disease broke out in the country's 52 flood-hit districts,
according to official figures. So far, 571,863 people had been affected by
the water-borne disease, the Associated Press of Bangladesh Tuesday quoted
an official of the Diarrhea Control Room under the Health Department as
saying. However, she said that the situation "is not alarming now and the
disease would not turn into epidemic." The epidemic form is measured when
the case fatality rate (CFR) is 1 percent, she stated, but the CFR was 0.14
percent on October 11 and 0.23 percent on October 12. To cope with the
situation, she said, a total of 4,732 medical teams are working in the
diarrhea-affected areas besides the non-government organizations.
Meanwhile, Red Crescent is expanding the post-flood relief program with 40
more medical teams which will start operating this week, and by then, a
total of 100 Red Crescent mobile medical teams will be working in the 33
districts worst hit by post-flood diseases, according to a Red Crescent
press release. The 100 mobile teams are funded by the International
Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent societies which appealed for more
than 338 million taka (about 7.19 million U.S. dollars). "The need of
medicine and medical care is still enormous in the post-flood period and
reports from our medical teams indicate that diarrhea and other diseases
are still spreading," said the release. Besides, thousands of Red Crescent
volunteers working in over 50 flood-hit districts have distributed more
than 400 tons of foodstuffs in flood relief, the release added.
The recent flooding, which had lasted for ten weeks starting from mid-July
and was the worst in a century, had gripped as much as two-thirds of the
country and affected about half of its 127 million people. It also left
over 1,000 people dead and caused an estimated loss of 4.3 billion dollars.
