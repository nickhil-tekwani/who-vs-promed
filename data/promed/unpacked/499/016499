Minnesota health officials are warning about a salmonellosis outbreak linked to salami sticks produced by Citterio and sold at Trader Joe's. There are 3 confirmed cases, but officials believe more people were infected and did not seek health care, according to a Minnesota Department of Health news release. The 3 people became ill between 20-29 Sep 2021 and one was hospitalized for 2 days. All have recovered from their symptoms, according to the news release issued Friday [22 Oct 2021].

The Department of Health advises the public to avoid eating Citterio Premium Italian-Style Salame Sticks, sold at Trader Joe's and other food retailers. All 3 people who were sickened reported purchasing salami sticks at different Trader Joe's locations. Health officials are investigating whether other brands of salami sticks or other Citterio products are also contaminated.

People who are ill and suspect _Salmonella_ should tell their healthcare provider about the outbreak, state health officials said. About 700 to 975 _Salmonella_ infections are reported each year in the state, according to the release.
