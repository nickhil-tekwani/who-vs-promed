A French tourist developed falciparum malaria after
travelling to the Bavaro area (province of La Altagracia, in
the east of the Dominican Republic) in August and September
2005.
On 18 Aug 2005, the patient in the recent case took a direct
flight from Paris to Punta Cana international airport. She
then went to Bavaro resort, near Punta Cana, where she and 2
travelling companions stayed for 2 weeks. The rooms in the
hotel were air conditioned, and the surroundings of the
resort were urban, with large multistory concrete buildings
and wide paved roads.
She went on 3 daytime excursions to Higuey, La Romana and
Campo. She spent every night inside her bungalow bedroom.
The only nighttime exposures outside Bavaro were 2 trips to
the small village of El Cortecito, located 10 km east of
Bavaro, with small shops and restaurants. These 2 visits
were on 26 Aug, to a restaurant where she reported that
there were numerous mosquitoes, and on 27 Aug, to an air
conditioned discotheque where she stayed until 1 am. She
returned to Paris from Punta Cana on 2 Sep. She took no
antimalarial chemoprophylaxis during her visit. This patient
had never travelled to areas at risk for malaria in the past
(she had previously taken 2 holidays in the Caribbean: to
Saint Martin 2 years previously, and to Guadeloupe, one year
previously) and had not received blood transfusion or organ
transplant in the previous 12 months.

[The previous cases were reported before 10 Jan 2005 except
one. The new case shows that there still is a very small
risk of _Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria in La Altagracia.
Reports of other recent cases should be reported. - Mod.EP]
