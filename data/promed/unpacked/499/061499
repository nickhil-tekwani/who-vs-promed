Rabies is a serious zoonotic disease. Recovery has been well documented in
only 6 human patients worldwide (1,2). Five of those patients had received
rabies vaccinations before illness; one had not received rabies vaccination
but survived infection after prolonged intensive care. In most of these
survivors, moderate to profound neurologic sequelae occurred (2,3). In all
6 survivors, rabies was diagnosed based on exposure history, compatible
clinical symptoms, and detection of rabies virus-neutralizing antibodies
(VNA). This report describes the clinical course and laboratory findings of
an adolescent girl with encephalitis who had not had rabies vaccination and
who had been exposed to bats 2 months before illness. Antibodies to rabies
virus were detected in specimens of the girl's serum and cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) by indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFA). However, the
presence of rabies VNA was not detected until after she had received single
doses of rabies vaccine and human rabies immune globulin (HRIG). Although
the patient required multiple hospitalizations and follow-up visits for
recurrent neurologic symptoms, she survived without intensive care. No
alternate etiology was determined, and abortive human rabies (defined in
this report as recovery from rabies without intensive care) was diagnosed.
Public education should emphasize avoiding exposure to bats and other
potentially rabid wildlife and seeking prompt medical attention after
exposure to such animals. Rabies is preventable if rabies immune globulin
and vaccine are administered soon after an exposure; however, this case
also suggests the rare possibility that abortive rabies can occur in humans
and might go unrecognized.

On 29 Feb 2009, an adolescent girl aged 17 years went to a community
hospital emergency department with severe frontal headache, photophobia,
emesis, neck pain, dizziness, and paresthesia of face and forearms. The
headaches had begun about 2 weeks before she went to the hospital. Her
examination was significant for intermittent disorientation, with a Glasgow
Coma Score of 14, nuchal rigidity, and fever to 102.0 F (38.9 C). Computed
tomography of her head was normal. A lumbar puncture (LP) was performed and
revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 163/mm3, no red blood cells
(RBC), 97 per cent lymphocytes, 3 per cent monocytes, and glucose of 61
mg/dL. The patient was treated with intravenous ceftriaxone and
dexamethasone, but when CSF [cerebrospinal fluid] bacterial cultures
produced no growth, these medications were discontinued. After 3 days in
the hospital, the girl's symptoms resolved, and she was discharged home.

Subsequently, her headaches recurred and intensified; on 6 Mar 2009, she
went to another local hospital with photophobia, emesis, and myalgias,
particularly of the neck and back. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her
head demonstrated enlarged lateral ventricles for her age; another LP was
performed and revealed a protein level of 160 mg/dL, WBC count of 185/mm3,
and RBC count of 1/mm3 with 95 per cent lymphocytes and 5 per cent
macrophages. She was transferred to a tertiary-care children's hospital
that same day.

On admission to the hospital, she was afebrile, alert, and oriented.
Fundoscopic examination demonstrated a blurring of disk margins
bilaterally. She was photophobic with transient limitation of vision in the
left visual field. Initially, she had decreased strength of the left lower
and upper extremities, but it resolved during subsequent examinations. She
also had a new papular pruritic rash on her arms and back. She received a
diagnosis of suspected infectious encephalitis and was treated during the
hospitalization with intravenous acyclovir, ceftriaxone, ethambutol,
isoniazid, pyrazinadmide, and rifapmin. On 10 Mar 20009, the girl reported
loss of sensation and strength of the right extremities, and weakness was
confirmed on examination. Emesis increased, and she became agitated and
combative. But these symptoms resolved the next day. Repeat LP demonstrated
increased intracranial pressure.

An extensive workup for potential etiologies of encephalitis/aseptic
meningitis was performed, but no definitive etiology was determined. On 10
Mar 2009, the medical team elicited a history of bat exposure, and rabies
was considered in the differential diagnosis. The patient recalled that
about 2 months before her headaches began she had entered a cave while on a
camping trip in Texas and came into contact with flying bats. Although
several bats hit her body, she did not notice any bites or scratches. The
patient also reported owning pet ferrets and a dog; all were in good health
and under routine veterinary care.

The patient reportedly had never received rabies prophylaxis. On 11 Mar
2009, serologic tests of serum and CSF for antirabies virus antibodies,
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests of saliva and nuchal skin biopsy for
the presence of rabies virus RNA, and direct fluorescent antibody tests of
the nuchal biopsy for rabies virus antigen were performed at CDC. No rabies
virus antigens or RNA were detected. However, 4 serum and CSF samples
tested positive for rabies virus antibodies by IFA. Serum immunoglobulin G
(IgG) reactivity increased to a peak dilution of 1:8192 and immunoglobulin
M (IgM) to 1:32. The CSF IgG was positive up to dilution 1:32 through 19
Mar 2009 and by 3 Apr 2009 had decreased to 1:8. The CSF IgM remained
negative. The positive IFA results were corroborated by a Western blot
assay performed in blinded fashion by an independent investigator. Although
rabies virus can cross react serologically with other members of the genus
_Lyssavirus_, Kern Canyon virus (KCV) is the only other rhabdovirus
associated with bats in North America that potentially could demonstrate a
limited serologic cross reactivity with rabies virus. KCV RNA was not
detected in the patient's skin biopsy, saliva, and CSF by nested PCR.

On 14 Mar 2009, after notification of positive rabies serology results, the
girl received one dose of rabies vaccine and 1500 IU of HRIG. Additional
doses of vaccine were not administered because of concern over possible
adverse effects from potentiating the immune response. On 19 Mar 2009 and
29 Mar 2009, the patient's serum tested positive for rabies VNA by the
rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT), whereas her CSF remained
negative for rabies VNA.

The patient was managed supportively and never required intensive care. She
was discharged on 22 Mar 2009 with clinical symptom resolution but returned
to the emergency department on 29 Mar 2009 with recurring headache. She
left before an LP could be performed, but returned to the emergency
department again on 3 Apr 2009 with headache and emesis. At that time, a LP
was performed, and her CSF opening pressure was still elevated. After the
LP, her headache resolved. She was not re-hospitalized and did not return
for follow up in the outpatient clinic.

Questionnaires were administered to close friends and family members of the
girl and to health-care workers to assess indications for post-exposure
prophylaxis (PEP). Only the girl's boyfriend met the criteria and received
PEP (4). The current clinical status of the patient or her boyfriend is
unknown.

MMWR editorial note
-------------------
This is the 1st reported case in which certain clinical and serologic
findings indicate abortive human rabies and in which, despite an extensive
medical investigation, no alternate etiology for the illness was
determined. The patient's positive serologic results offer evidence of
rabies virus infection; IFA and Western blot assays indicated the presence
of antibodies capable of binding to rabies virus antigens before the
patient received rabies PEP. Rabies virus can cross react serologically
with other members of the genus _Lyssavirus_, distributed in Australia,
Eurasia, and Africa (5) or, theoretically, with as yet uncharacterized
rhabdoviruses. However, this patient had no history of foreign travel and
no evidence of infection with KCV, the only other rhabdovirus associated
with bats in North America.

Laboratory diagnosis of rabies antemortem is based typically on routine
detection of viral antigen in a full-thickness skin biopsy, viral RNA in
the skin biopsy or saliva, or antibodies in serum and CSF. Only antibodies
were found in this patient. However, viral antigen and RNA often are not
detected in infected humans antemortem because of limited virus replication
and intermittent viral excretion in saliva (1,4,6). Notably, the diagnosis
of rabies in all human survivors has been based solely on serologic
findings, including the presence of VNA, but without virus isolation or
detection of viral antigens or RNA (2,6).

Certain other clinical and laboratory findings also support a diagnosis of
abortive rabies in the patient described in this report. 1st, the onset of
acute encephalopathy about 2 months after exposure to bats is compatible
with documented incubation periods after rabies virus exposure. 2nd,
central nervous system (CNS) findings (such as fever, photophobia, emesis,
neck pain, dizziness, paresthesia, limitation of visual field, and altered
behavior with agitation and combativeness) are compatible with clinical
aspects of rabies. Although this patient did not have classic symptoms such
as laryngeal spasms (manifested as hydrophobia) or autonomic instability,
the lack of such symptoms has been documented in other rabies patients
(1,2,6). Finally, despite an extensive medical workup, no alternate
infectious etiology was identified for the patient's neurologic symptoms,
increased intracranial pressure, and CSF pleocytosis.

In animal models, both cellular and humoral immune responses are important
indicators in survivorship after rabies virus infection (7--9). In this
report, the patient's serologic profile suggests that her immune system
cleared the rabies virus before production of VNA. This might help explain
the patient's atypical (that is, waxing and waning) neurologic course. In
more typical rabies cases, infected persons who have not received rabies
PEP experience a rapid neurologic decline, resulting in death. Human
survivors of rabies have demonstrated a vigorous immune response to the
virus, as measured by serum and CSF antibody levels (2,4). However, CSF IgG
in the patient in this report never exceeded a dilution of 1:32, with serum
IgG reaching 1:8192, not nearly as high as values reported in previous
survivors (1). Another patient, given experimental treatment, showed
evidence for neurologic recovery, with high serum but low CSF VNA, but died
shortly after therapy (10).

Detection of viral antibodies in serum can be indicative of previous
vaccination or exposure to a lyssavirus, but does not necessarily indicate
the development of disease. Contact with virus does not ultimately
constitute a productive infection (for example, the virus can be
inactivated by the host innate response or by other means before
replication in host cells). Similarly, a productive infection does not
necessarily result in transportation of virus to the CNS. An abortive
infection can occur outside the CNS, with limited replication of the virus
at the exposure site and further clearance by the host immune system (7,8).

Rabies virus is a highly neurotropic pathogen, transported from the
exposure site to the CNS by peripheral nerves without significant local
replication and avoiding or impairing the host immune response during the
incubation period. Thereafter, when the virus reaches higher concentrations
in the CNS and spreads peripherally, specific antibodies can be detected as
the clinical course evolves. Typically, the detection of specific virus
antibodies in the CSF indicates a CNS infection. Based on evidence to date
with rabies patients [in the United States], antibodies to the abundant
viral nucleocapsid antigens detected by IFA are registered 1st, whereas
VNA, directed to the outer viral glycoprotein, are only detected later by
RFFIT, if VNA are detected at all. The patient described in this report did
not have detectable rabies VNA in the serum until after receiving rabies
vaccine and HRIG.

In all previous human survivors, rabies was diagnosed based on exposure
histories, compatible clinical symptoms, and detection of rabies virus
antibodies. However, in all of those patients, the clinical courses were
substantially longer, with more severe neurologic compromise and more
prominent stimulation of the immune system, including the induction of VNA.
In the case presented here, the clinical manifestation was relatively mild,
which might imply variables associated with viral dose, route, and type,
with a more limited virus replication and less apparent stimulation of the
immune system. Clinicians treating possible cases of human rabies,
indicated by acute, progressive infectious encephalitis, a compatible
exposure history, and serologic evidence of a specific lyssavirus response,
even in the absence of detectable VNA or fulminant neurologic decline,
should contact their state health department for engagement with CDC.

[The clinical data and the time course of the illness are tabulated and
illustrated graphically in the original text.

Only 6 human rabies survivors have been well documented after clinical
onset, and none of the survivors had abortive rabies (that is, recovery
without intensive care). This is the 1st reported case in which certain
clinical and serologic findings indicate abortive human rabies and in
which, despite an extensive medical investigation, no alternate etiology
for the illness was determined.

It is unfortunate that no viral genomic RNA was obtained during this
investigation, which could have verified the source of the infection. The
presumed contact with an infected bat is no more than circumstantial. Not
all strains of rabies virus are pathogenic in humans, for example the SAD/B
attenuated strains which have been used to vaccinate wildlife in Central
Europe. - Mod.CP]
