Health authorities in Los Santos province reported this [Tue 15 Aug 2017] that 2 children have been diagnosed with hantavirus [infections]. Dr Carlos Mu√±oz, Regional Coordinator of Epidemiology for Los Santos confirmed this information for TVN Noticias.

One case was notified in the Los Santos district, and the most recent one a 7-year-old child from the Bebederos neighborhood of Tonosi, who remains hospitalized and under observation in the Las Tablas Hospital.

This brings to 7 the total cases of hantavirus fever and to 2 the cases of hantavirus [cardiopulmonary] syndrome in the province.

An inspection where the child resides was carried out. The authorities have issued a call to maintain control of crops and to do correct disposition of trash and garbage.

[No information is provided about child previous to the most recent case, nor of the result of the inspection of the area where the 7-year-old child lives. Apparently, this recent case has hantavirus fever without hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). HPS is a serious disease and can develop quickly, with a case fatality rate of around 30 percent.

This report does not give any details about the circumstances that led to the infection nor specify the hantavirus involved in this case. As noted in comments on previous cases, Los Santos and adjoining provinces are endemic for Choclo hantavirus. Although no data on this or the previous cases in earlier years include an indication of which hantavirus is responsible, Choclo is the only one of the 3 hantaviruses known to be endemic in Panama that causes HPS or hantavirus fever. No vaccine is available for Choclo virus.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents occur in and around agricultural areas and adjacent houses and buildings.
