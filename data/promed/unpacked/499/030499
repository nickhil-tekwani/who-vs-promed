[Comment 1. It will be interesting to note why the reporting Chinese veterinary authorities have opted to indicate 4 Apr 2013 as the date of start for each of the 3 "outbreaks" covered in the above follow-up report No 7. While this was given as the initial start of the entire event (based upon the first positive laboratory test, weeks after the diagnosis of H7N9 in humans who obviously had been infected from sub-clinical vector animals), indicating 4 Apr 2013 as the start date for Guangdong, where the current positive test is the very first confirmation of H7N9 circulation and where no human case has been reported so far, will be more difficult to explain.

Comment 2. Culling of 89 864 birds (chickens?) in the Sanniao live bird wholesale market, Dongcheng, Dongguan, Guangdong probably means the application of stamping-out policy. This may be explained by the fact that this is the first detection of the virus in this southeastern province bordering Hong Kong, where - so far - no human cases have been recorded. It will be interesting to note if the origin of the infected chicken could be traced back and how many other samples, from which animals/sources, have been collected and tested in Guangdong.

The report includes an interactive map, illustrating the spread of the virus along eastern China from north to south.

[Further to ProMED-mail's request, Dan Silver, ProMED-mail Chinese-language Web Researcher, went back to Chinese media sources to try sort-out the H7N9 case reported to the OIE (Follow-up report No 3) by the Chinese veterinary services as a "wild pigeon" in Qinhuai, Nanjing, Jiangsu, dated 16 Apr 2013. The Chinese Ministry of Agriculture named the said infected bird in its web-site as a "Rock dove". Dan's findings were the following:]

Attached is a partial translation (title only) of an article from a Nanjing newspaper describing the "Rock Dove" that China's Ministry of Agriculture confirmed positive for H7N9.

The newspaper's report is to be seen at http://kb.dsqq.cn/html/2013-04/18/content_258797.htm. The photo is apparently of the dead bird.

The article states that an ornithologist believes it could be Streptopelia based on the photo.

The bird reportedly died on 6 Apr 2013 after flying into a barbershop window on Hongwu Road, based on an interview with a shop employee. It does not appear that the government verified the information contained in the article.

[We have addressed several questions pertaining to the above report to a birding veterinary colleague for his view. Here are some of his preliminary reflections:

The newspaper picture is absolutely useless -- unclear whether it is avian even! There are expert ornithologists in China and it is unlikely that no one can identify the species, especially as they are rather easy to differentiate.

I'll refer mainly to Streptopelia spp. Pigeons are invariably non-migratory = resident.

If the bird was found in Nanjing, it is most likely, IMHO, of the Streptopelia, to be the Oriental turtle dove or the Red turtle dove.

The Oriental turtle dove, _S. orientalis_ is common in all China. Large flocks pass through S China on spring migration. Northern populations from N Asia from Siberia to Japan migrate to & from S Asia - from India to S & E China to S Japan. Generally resident in S Asia.

I should imagine that they migrate south on an enormously wide front. It is not like in the migration from Europe to Africa that natural geographic barriers create rather narrow migration routes for some species. The migration season for the doves will vary too, according to the location of the breeding area & wintering areas. I can only give educated guesses on these questions.

Subscribers with ornithological background are encouraged to add their views. -Mod. AS.]
