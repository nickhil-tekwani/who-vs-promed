http://www.afro.who.int/en/media-centre/pressreleases/item/6920-who-organizes-workshop-to-strengthen-preparedness-and-response-for-countries-against-ebola.html


The 1st in a series of preparedness and response workshops aimed at strengthening Africa's defences against the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak occurring in parts of West Africa began on Tue [26 Aug 2014] in Brazzaville, Congo. Organized by the World Health Organization (WHO), the 3-day workshop brings together more than 40 Disease Prevention and Control Officers; Clinicians and Infection Control Officers; as well as Social Mobilization, Health Education and Communication experts from 10 countries. Participants are drawn from the Ministries of Health and WHO Country Offices in Botswana, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Namibia, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. ...

It is expected that at the end of the workshop, they would have acquired the necessary knowledge and skills to adequately conduct similar workshops in their respective countries.

Since the start of the outbreak, 1st reported in Guinea on 21 Mar 2014, WHO and partners have deployed more than 450 people to the 4 affected countries, Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria. Experts deployed include, among others, field coordinators, clinicians, epidemiologists, infection control and prevention specialists, logisticians and data managers, communication specialists, medical anthropologists and social mobilizers.

Sierra Leone
----------
Canadians pulled from Sierra Leone as precaution
26 Aug 2014 (CBC News): The Public Health Agency of Canada said in a statement late Tue [26 Aug 2014] that it is finalizing plans to bring the 3-person mobile team from Winnipeg's National Microbiology Laboratory home from Sierra Leone. The team is being recalled after 3 people staying at their hotel were diagnosed with the ebolavirus. None of the team members had direct contact with those diagnosed, and they are not displaying any signs of illness, officials said. The team members will remain in voluntary isolation and will be monitored as they travel back to Canada. Those plans have not yet been firmed up, PHAC said. The United Nations health agency [WHO] had earlier announced it was pulling [3] staff from a laboratory testing for the ebolavirus in Kailahun, in Sierra Leone, after a Senegalese epidemiologist was infected. "It's a temporary measure to take care of the welfare of our remaining workers," WHO spokesperson Christy Feig told Reuters, without specifying how long the measure would last. "After our assessment, they will return." The 3 Canadians were among 6 workers at the lab. There will be an investigation to see whether it was a routine infection or something to do with the lab's processes or equipment, WHO said. Meanwhile, there are 5 Canadian staff members with Doctors Without Borders who all remain in Sierra Leone, a representative of the organization said, but it was unclear how many are in Kailahun http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/ebola-outbreak-canadians-pulled-from-sierra-leone-as-precaution-1.2746945.

[So how will the lab be staffed? Will all samples now have to be processed at Kenema? They need to be able to exclude negative people and confirm fatalities. It also means that fewer samples will be processed, and the number of confirmed cases in Sierra Leone will not rise as fast as before. In any case, how can they be sure that the epidemiologist became infected in the hot lab? Maybe he visited the hospital, or got it in the course of doing household interviews, from fomites; he knew enough not to touch a case. - Mod.JW]

Nigeria
-------
Postponement of return to school
27 Aug 2014: The Federal Government ... announced the postponement of resumption of all primary and secondary schools till 13 Oct 2014, even as government cleared the air on the health status of a sister to the late Dr. Stella Ameyo Adadevoh, confirming that she is EVD-free. ... The Minister of Education, Mallam Ibrahim Shekarau, in Abuja yesterday [26 Aug 2014], said: "All state Ministries of Education are to immediately organise and ensure that at least 2 staff in each school, both public and private, are trained by appropriate health workers on how to handle any suspected case of EVD and also embark on immediate sensitization of all teaching and non-teaching staff in all schools on preventive measures. This training of staff must be concluded not later than 15 Sep 2014."

---------

Mass quarantine doomed to fail
------------------------
25 Aug 2014 (CBC News): Dr. Richard Schabas, formerly chief medical officer for Ontario [Canada] notes that mass quarantine was tried during the 2003 outbreak of SARS in Toronto [Canada], with about 30 000 people ordered to stay home. But the measure failed. "It involved a huge disruption and huge investment of public health resources," said Dr. Schabas. "It created the perception that SARS was more dangerous and more widespread than it was. It triggered things like travel advisories, which were economically damaging." Dr. Schabas argues that for a quarantine to be useful, it has to make sure people comply with quarantine conditions, and the infectious disease must be transmissible when patients don't yet show symptoms. Neither SARS nor EVD is transmissible when a patient [has no symptoms]. ...

Pharmacist fatalities

26 Aug 2014: (APhA) Community pharmacy professionals are among the EVD fatalities of health care workers in Sierra Leone, according to an article on the International Pharmaceutical Federation's (FIP) website. According to the article, "one pharmacist and 4 pharmacy technicians have died, all 5 from the community pharmacy sector [in Sierra Leone]." FIP also noted that a report from the Pharmaceutical Society of Sierra Leone reported the death of a pharmacy technician who was practicing in a community pharmacy in Kenema. https://www.pharmacist.com/pharmacists-mobilize-who-affirms-use-experimental-ebola-drugs

Pledge by Scottish Government
----------------------------------------
22 Aug 2014: the Scottish Government has pledged GBL 500 000 [USD 828 000] of emergency funding to help combat the deadly EVD outbreak in West Africa. The cash will support local and international efforts to control the epidemic and prevent further spread of the disease, which has killed [more than] 1350 people this year [2014]. ... The money will be released to the World Health Organization, the International Rescue Committee, and UNICEF. It has been earmarked to support efforts to speed up specialist care, improve monitoring and tracking of the disease and deliver resources such as emergency kits, clean blankets, hygiene and sanitising equipment.

EVD orphans newest victims
------------------------
19 Aug 2014: Orphans whose families were killed by EVD are becoming a tragic legacy of the deadly outbreak in [3] West African nations, say relief organizations struggling to care for the children who may themselves be infected. ... Besides immediate needs such as food, the growing number of children whose families have been decimated by EVD will likely face long-term stigma and discrimination in the future as aid groups try to reintegrate them into the community, according to UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund.
