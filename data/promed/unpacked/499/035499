Mutation of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 virus in Norway
------------------------------------------------------------
The Norwegian Institute of Public Health announced today [20 Nov
2009] to have found a mutated version of the influenza pandemic
(H1N1) 2009 virus in 3 patients in Norway who had tested positive for
the new flu.

The Norwegian Institute of Public Health has analysed virus from a
number of patients as part of the surveillance of the pandemic flu
virus. The viruses have many similarities, but some mutations have
been observed. This is normal and most of these mutations will
probably have little or no importance.

However, one mutation has caught special interest. It has been found
in 2 patients who died from the new influenza A (H1N1) and in one
patient with severe influenza disease. These were the 1st 2 patients
who died from the new influenza in Norway. Some of those who died
later have been examined without finding the same mutated virus. The
mutation could possibly make the virus more prone to infect deeper in
the airways and thus cause more severe disease.

- We have analysed approximately 70 viruses from confirmed Norwegian
cases and found the mutation in only these 3 patients, says Director
General Geir Stene-Larsen at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health.

- Based on what we know so far, it seems that the mutated virus does
not circulate in the population, but might be a result of spontaneous
changes, which have occurred in these 3 patients.

- There is no indication that this change in the virus is of any
importance for the effect of the vaccine or the effect of antiviral
treatment, concludes Stene-Larsen.

Norwegian scientists raise concerns about mutated form of swine flu
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Scientists in Norway have identified a mutated form of the swine flu
[influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection] virus that is
raising concern because it was found in 2 patients who died of the
flu and a 3rd who was severely ill with the disease, officials
announced Friday [20 Nov 2009]. In a statement, the Norwegian
Institute of Public Health [above] said the mutation "could possibly
make the virus more prone to infect deeper in the airways and thus
cause more severe disease."

Scientists have analyzed about 70 viruses from confirmed Norwegian
swine flu cases and found the mutation in only those 3 patients, Geir
Stene-Larsen, the institute's director general, said in the
statement. "Based on what we know so far, it seems that the mutated
virus does not circulate in the population, but might be a result of
spontaneous changes which have occurred in these 3 patients," the
statement said.

The institute has been analyzing H1N1 virus from "a number of
patients as part of the surveillance of the pandemic flu virus," the
statement said. "The viruses have many similarities, but some
mutations have been observed." While the existence of mutations is
normal, and most "will probably have little or no importance," the
statement said, "one mutation has caught special interest." The 2
patients who had the mutation and died were the 1st swine flu
fatalities in Norway. The 3rd patient found to have the mutated form
of the virus also became severely ill.

According to the institute's statement, the change in the virus did
not appear to impair the efficacy of the vaccine or antiviral treatment.

Officials from the World Health Organization and the US Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention could not immediately be reached for comment.

[In Eurosurveillance 14(46), 19 Nov 2009, Fereidouni SR, Beer M,
Vahlenkamp T, and Starick E describe "Differentiation of two distinct
clusters among currently circulating influenza A(H1N1)v viruses,
March-September 2009"
(<http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=19409>).
"Analysis of all complete genome sequences of the pandemic influenza
(H1N1) 2009 virus available as of 10 Sep 2009 revealed that 2 closely
related but distinct clusters were circulating in most of the
affected countries at the same time. The characteristic differences
are located in genes encoding the 2 surface proteins --
haemagglutinin and neuraminidase -- and 4 internal proteins -- the
polymerase PB2 subunit, nucleoprotein, matrix protein M1, and the
non-structural protein NS1. None of the changes in the sequences
seemed to be located in regions of the genome responsible for known
phenotypic differences or biological functions."

Most sequences from Mexico, Texas, and California belonged to cluster
1, whereas most sequences from New York belonged to cluster 2.
Whether these differences were due to the geographical region, the
date of isolation or other reasons needs to be elucidated in further
epidemiological investigations. Virus sequences of both clusters have
been reported from most countries on different continents.

How the Norwegian viruses relate to these clusters as well as their
biological relevance remain to be established. - Mod.CP]
