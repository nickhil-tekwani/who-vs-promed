A scabies epidemic is spreading among residents and workers at an old
people's home in Jarbo, close to Sandviken in northwestern Sweden.
Eight people are in the early stages of scabies, a skin disease that
usually affects animals, caused by parasitic mites. Symptoms include
loss of hair and scabby eruptions. According to Gefle Dagbladet, the
housing facility management is afraid that the highly contagious
disease will spread and affect pensioners who live there and nursing
workers who frequent the home. "There were a lot of people who
complained about itching problems; we tried to examine what the
reasons were," according to Monika Matsson, chief manager at
Asgarden, the company running the home.

Symptoms have been spotted among more pensioners, but it usually
takes about a month for the disease to fully develop. 78 people live
and work in the home.
