Four people have died and another 11 residents are in extremely serious
condition [with tick-borne] encephalitis in the Jewish Autonomous Region
(JAR), Olga Yanovich, a departmental chief at the JAR sanitary and
epidemiological supervision centre, told Itar-Tass on Thursday. At least
30-40 people apply to medics for aid every day in connection with tick
bites. The unprecedented activity of the insects is accounted for by an
unusually sharp expansion of their habitats and an increase in their
numbers.
The ticks have occupied not only forests that are adjacent to villages and
townships but also country-cottage land plots. The insects are reported to
have emerged even in the green belts of cities. Unfortunately, only
slightly more than 5% of JAR residents were vaccinated against encephalitis
in time.

[It remains to be determined whether the etiologic agent is central
European encephalitis virus or Russian spring-summer encephalitis virus,
both flaviviruses. Assuming the former, adequate vaccination likely would
have prevented this outbreak. If anyone familiar with this episode can let
us know the circumstances leading to the expansion of tick habitat, please
do. I saw a TV program on Birobijan some weeks ago; fascinating attempt at
social management. Infuriating (to me), too. - Mod.CHC]
