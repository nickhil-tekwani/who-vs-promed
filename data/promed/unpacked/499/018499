A total of 9 more cases and 3 more deaths have been reported since 3
Oct 2011 in the _Listeria_ outbreak tied to cantaloupe, bringing the
totals to 109 cases with 21 deaths, the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) said today (7 Oct 2011) [see
http://www.cdc.gov/listeria/outbreaks/cantaloupes-jensen-farms/100711/index.html].
4 states -- Iowa, New York, Oregon, and South Dakota -- had their 1st
cases, raising the number of affected states to 24, the CDC update
shows. The latest deaths included one each in Indiana, New York, and
Wyoming.

The cases have been linked to Rocky Ford brand cantaloupe from Jensen
Farms in Colorado. Most of those sickened in the outbreak are over the
age of 60, and the median age is 77. Nearly all patients for whom
information was available -- 105 of 107 -- were hospitalized. CDC
officials have called the outbreak the most deadly foodborne disease
episode in a decade. Last week officials said they expected reports of
cases to continue for several weeks, as the incubation time for
listeriosis is up to 2 months.

In a related development, a company in western New York has recalled
4800 packages containing cantaloupe because of possible _Listeria_
contamination related to the Jensen Farms recall, the Associated Press
reported today. The firm, Fruit Fresh Up Inc. of Depew, said the
products included cantaloupe pieces and various fruit salads sold in
the Buffalo area through stores and caterers between 31 Aug and 11 Sep
[2011], the story said.

[Cantaloupe grow on a vine on the ground and the rind can become
contaminated with enteric pathogens by contact with contaminated soil,
fertilizer, or water used for irrigation or washing. Contamination
could also occur later during the distribution process. Cutting
through the outer skin can then contaminate the pulp of cantaloupe, if
washing of the outside is inadequate. It is therefore important to
wash the melon thoroughly before cutting into it, since bacteria can
grow on the rind. However, because _Listeria_ multiple at refrigerator
temperatures, inoculation of the pulp by even low numbers of the
organism can result in high-grade contamination of refrigerated
product.
