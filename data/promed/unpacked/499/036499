Turkey Asks for EU Aid to Fight Foot-and-Mouth Disease
--------------------------------------------------------
ANKARA 3 Dec 2000 (Xinhuanet): Turkey has asked the European Union (EU) to
grant 50 million euros (43.5 million U.S. dollars) in aid to help fight
foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), which has affected 40 percent of the
country's animal husbandry industry.
Turkey is subject to a widespread wave of FMD as a result of livestock
smuggling from neighboring countries, said officials from the Agriculture
and Rural Affairs Ministry.
Thanks to 5 million euros (4.35 million dollars) of EU assistance, the
Thracian region, which is adjacent to Greece and Bulgaria, was saved from
the disease, the officials said.
Turkey, Greece and Bulgaria have been engaged in a regional cooperation
aimed at preventing the spread of this disease to Europe. Turkey told the
EU in October it needs 50 million euros to form a buffer zone in eastern
and southeastern regions, which suffer most from livestock smuggling.
The final decision about formation of the buffer zone is expected to be
taken by the EU Standing Veterinary Committee. The EU does not allow
imports of animal products from Turkey except the Thracian region because
of FMD. Animal husbandry has a significant role in Turkey's economy. Its
share in total agricultural production amounts to 25 percent. Official
figures showed Turkey now has 11 million cattle and 29 million sheep.
