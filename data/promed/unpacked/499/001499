[1] Israel: omicron
Date: Wed 22 Dec 2021
Source: Haaretz [edited]
https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/israel-s-covid-panel-says-covid-omicron-wave-is-a-tsunami-1.10487562


The head of Israel's pandemic advisory panel said Wednesday [22 Dec 2021] that the COVID-19 omicron variant, is "a kind of tsunami or tornado," a day after the panel recommended a 2nd booster shot for people 60 and older, people with compromised immune systems, and medical personnel.

It is not yet clear when the recommendation will take effect. "We issued a recommendation, but it's still on ice," the panel's chairman, Dr Boaz Lev, said in a press conference. "It's not yet clear when it will be implemented. No decision has been made yet, and it hasn't been adopted by the Health Ministry's director general yet. We're still gathering data."

Lev said the main impetus for the recommendation was the spread of the omicron variant. The variant "is off and running and trampling over everything in its way," he continued, and the effectiveness of the 3rd dose of the vaccine seems to be waning.

He also cited other reasons for the panel's decision. One, he said, is the evidence that the effectiveness of the 3rd dose wanes over time, especially when confronted with omicron.

Another is that the cost of excess caution might well be increased incidence of severe illness and death, though there is no way of knowing how much. In contrast, he said, the cost of giving high-risk groups another dose is very small, given the likelihood that it will boost people's antibody levels -- thereby saving lives -- and the limited risk of serious side effects.

This kind of calculation, he added, is necessary when you are managing risks under conditions of uncertainty. Nevertheless, he said, the panel plans to spend the coming days gathering as much data as possible from countries where omicron is already rampant, and this data will be considered when the final decision is made.

Omicron's reproduction number, meaning how many people each patient infects, ranges from 3 to almost 5 in other countries, Lev said. "In Britain, the R number is 4.8, in Germany it is 3.1, and in the US it is close to 3. These are enormous reproduction numbers that we haven't seen in the past."

Aside from recommending a 4th dose for certain groups, the panel recommended that the 3rd dose be given 3 months after the 2nd, rather than 5 as had previously been done. But all its recommendations still need approval from the Health Ministry's director general, Nachman Ash.

Brosh said there is still "great uncertainty over how much serious illness this wave will bring, but we can't be naïve and assume this is a very weak virus that won't do anything."

Even if omicron proves to cause less serious illness, he explained, it is expected to infect twice as many people as previous variants and will therefore still result in many seriously ill patients.

[2] Israel: wastewater detection tool
Date: Mon 20 Dec 2021 12:34 IST

https://www.ynetnews.com/health_science/article/sjsao065y


Speaking at the Knesset committee, Prof. Zarka says the new strain has been in waste systems of Harish, Nesher, Netanya, and Ashdod; adds officials will meet to debate caps on gatherings; head of public health urges those recovered from virus to get jabbed as well.

The omicron coronavirus variant has been detected in Israel's sewage system, the country's pandemic czar said on Monday [20 Dec 2021], an indication that the new strain is far more prevalent than previously thought.

According to samples taken a week ago, the mutation has been found in the sewage systems of the northern towns of Harish and Nesher, in the central city of Netanya, and in the southern city of Ashdod.

Speaking during a special joint hearing of Knesset's health and constitution committees, Prof. Salman Zarka said that Health Ministry officials will meet Monday [20 Dec 2021] to discuss possible restrictions on public gatherings and later present them to Prime Minister Naftali Bennett.

"We understand that we are dealing with an infectious strain, so we must examine what future steps we are going to take," he said.

He added that there has been an increase in COVID-19 infection among children as well as a spike in patients admitted to intensive care units.

"We were the first in the world to offer the 3rd vaccine dose. Regarding populations at risk, we are holding discussions on the possibility of offering a 4th vaccine and we will see if we can reach an understanding."

During the same meeting, Health Minister Nitzan Horowitz warned about the strain's rapid spread in Israel.

"The variant is accelerating rapidly and is showing an ability to spread we have not witnessed with past strains," he said.

Horowitz again stressed that the only effective way to deal with the pandemic is with vaccines. "We are not seeing a suffice rise in inoculations," he said. "People ask me 'is the public guilty?' The public is not guilty but it must be said that the state is offering the vaccines to everyone for free.

"At the end of the day, it is parents first and foremost who are responsible for vaccinating their children. If a parent chooses not to vaccinate their children -- that's their prerogative. If you want to protect your children from the disease -- you need to protect them. If you don't want them to become seriously ill or suffer from long-COVID -- you need to vaccinate them. The state cannot replace the parent's responsibility for their children."

Head of Public Health Dr Sharon Alroy-Preis reiterated Horowitz's statements, saying she would urge even those who recently recovered from the virus to get inoculated since natural antibodies appear to be weaker when faced with omicron.

"Vaccines do not have prolonged side effects lasting years. It makes no biological sense to say it. We know from 7 million children who were vaccinated in the United States and from 100 000 children in Israel who did not report significant side effects."

Also on Monday [20 Dec 2021], Israel added the United States to its "no-fly" list, citing concerns over the spread of the COVID-19 omicron variant.

Besides US and Canada, the cabinet -- acting on Health Ministry recommendations -also voted to put Italy, Belgium, Germany, Hungary, Morocco, Portugal, Switzerland, and Turkey on the no-fly roster, Prime Minister NaftaBennett's office said in a statement.

[3] Omicron: reports on severity
Date: Wed 22 Dec 2021
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) News [edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/12/more-reports-bolster-evidence-lower-omicron-severity


South African researchers yesterday shared more evidence on the omicron variant impact, which supports initial signs that illnesses may be less severe, with separate groups from the United Kingdom reporting similar findings.

Scientists still aren't certain about severity and the role high population immunity is playing, but the signs are reassuring as countries face steep omicron (B.1.1.529) surges ahead of the holidays.

More data from South Africa
---------------------------
The South African study appeared yesterday [21 Dec 2021] in a non-peer-reviewed study posted on medRxiv [Wolter N, Jassat W, Walaza S, et al. Early assessment of the clinical severity of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant in South Africa. medRxiv 2021; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.21.21268116]. A research team based at the country's National Institute for Communicable Diseases used multiple data sets to look at test, case, genome, and hospitalization across South Africa to compare omicron with other variants, including delta (B1617.2).

They looked at hospitalization and severe disease through 6 Dec 2021, enough time to capture delayed, more serious outcomes, which the initial reports weren't able to assess.

They found that the hospitalization rate was 80% lower for omicron as compared to other variants overall and 70% lower when compared specifically with delta. They said some of the reduction is probably due to high population immunity.

However, once hospitalized, those with omicron were similarly as likely as those with Delta to progress to severe disease.

At a briefing today [22 Dec 2021], South African officials said the outbreak in Gauteng province is past its peak, and cases are leveling off in 3 other provinces. However, officials cautioned that patterns may be affected by lower testing levels in the lead-up to the holidays.

Similar signals from England, Scotland
--------------------------------------
In a related development, researchers from Imperial College London, who looked at cases and hospitalization data from England, found that those with confirmed omicron infections were 15%-20% less likely to be hospitalized, compared with those with delta. Those hospitalized with omicron also had shorter hospital stays. Also, those who had omicron after earlier COVID-19 infection were 50%-60% less likely to be hospitalized, compared with those with no previous infection.
[Ferguson N, Ghani A, Hinsley W, Volz E, on behalf of the Imperial College COVID-19 response team. Report 50 -- Hospitalisation risk for Omicron cases in England. MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis. Imperial College of London. 22 Dec 2021; https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/covid-19/report-50-severity-omicron/].

However, hospitalization rates were similar for those with omicron and delta among those who had at least 2 vaccine doses, hinting at reduced vaccine efficacy against omicron. The team also notes that the hospitalization risk for vaccinated people was still significantly lower than for unvaccinated people.

Meanwhile, a separate group from Scotland, in a preprint study, said early data from the country suggest a 2/3 reduction in COVID-19 hospitalization with omicron compared with delta. They also reported that a booster dose protects against symptomatic omicron infection compared with those who were 25 or more weeks past their 2nd dose. [Sheikh A, Kerr S, Woolhouse M, et al. Severity of omicron variant of concern and vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease: national cohort with nested test negative design study in Scotland. Edinburgh Research Explorer. University of Edinburgh; https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/245818096/Severity_of_Omicron_variant_of_ concern_and_vaccine_effectiveness_against_symptomatic_disease.pdf].

More global headlines
---------------------
- In Europe, the UK and France both reported new daily record highs for cases today [22 Dec 2021]. Also, the UK's Health Security Agency reported 13 581 more omicron cases, raising its total to 74 089. Omicron hospitalizations rose from 129 to 195, and deaths from the variant rose from 14 to 18.
- Following the recommendation of its vaccine advisory group, Israel's government yesterday [21 Dec 2021] said those 60 and older and health workers can receive a 4th vaccine dose, due to the fast pace of omicron spread and waning antibodies after booster doses. Israel was one of the 1st countries to adopt booster doses. The 4th dose would be given 4 months after the 3rd dose.
- In Asia, the Chinese city of Xian, home to 13 million people, is on partial lockdown after 140 cases were reported since [12 Dec 2021] and other cities, including Beijing, reported cases linked to Xian's outbreak. Elsewhere, Japan reported its 1st local omicron spread, with 3 cases reported in a family in Osaka.
- World Health Organization (WHO) vaccine advisers weighed in on booster doses, noting that evidence suggests minimal to modest reductions in protection against severe disease over the 6 months after the primary series. However, so far, there aren't enough data to assess omicron's impact on vaccines. It said countries should take evidence-based approaches that target the prevention of severe disease. It also said about 20% of the global supply is going toward booster doses, a situation that's complicating vaccine equity.

- Also today [22 Dec 2021], the WHO issued new mask use guidelines given the rapid spread of omicron, one set suggesting respirators or medical masks for healthcare workers, worn along with other protective equipment, who enter a room where a patient has suspected or confirmed COVID-19. The other guidance covers mask use in community settings [see https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-IPC_Masks-Health_Workers-Omicron_variant-2021.1 and [https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-IPC_masks-2021.1].

[4] Metabolic syndrome and COVID
Date: Wed 22 Dec 2021
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) News [edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/12/1-4-metabolic-syndrome-and-covid-risk-breathing-distress


An international study of 29 040 hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients finds that metabolic syndrome was tied to significantly greater odds of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death. [Denson JL, Gillet AS, Zu Y, et al; Society of Critical Care Medicine Discovery Viral Infection and Respiratory Illness Universal Study (VIRUS): COVID-19 Registry Investigator Group. Metabolic syndrome and acute respiratory distress syndrome in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. JAMA Netw Open. 2021; 4(12): e2140568; https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.40568].

While obesity, diabetes, and hypertension are known risk factors for severe COVID-19, the researchers said that little was known about the risk of metabolic syndrome -- a cluster of conditions that includes high blood pressure, high blood glucose, excess fat around the waist, and abnormal cholesterol levels. Metabolic syndrome, a chronic low-grade inflammatory state, is a risk factor for heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes.

The team, headed by researchers from Tulane University and Mayo Clinic, analyzed data from the Society of Critical Care Medicine Discovery Viral Respiratory Illness Universal Study from 181 hospitals in 26 countries from 15 Feb 2020-18 Feb 2021.

Risk of ARDS, death
-------------------
Of the 46 441 COVID-19 patients in the database, 29 040 (43.2%) met inclusion criteria; 17.5% of them had metabolic syndrome, and 82.5% were control patients. Mean patient age was 61.2 years, 45% were women, 57.8% were White, 23.4% were Black, and 18.3% were Hispanic.

In adjusted analyses, metabolic syndrome was linked to a 32% increased risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.32), 45% higher risk of invasive mechanical ventilation, 36% increase in ARDS (1.36), and 19% higher death rate, as well as prolonged hospital stay (median 8.0 vs 6.8 days), and ICU stay (median 7.0 vs 6.4 days).

Each additional metabolic syndrome criterion was tied to an increased risk of ARDS in an additive fashion (1 criterion, 1147 ARDS patients [10.4%]; 2 criteria, 1191 patients [15.3%]; 3 criteria, 817 patients [19.3%]; and 4 criteria, 203 patients [24.3%]).

Among all patients, 87.9% were hospitalized in the United States and had an average body mass index (BMI) of 30.6 kilograms per square meter and an Elixhauser Comorbidity Score of 3.1 (0 indicating no underlying disease). The most common underlying metabolic syndrome conditions were high blood pressure (53.7%), prediabetes or diabetes (33.5%), and obesity (49.3%).

Relative to controls, patients diagnosed as having metabolic syndrome were more likely to be women (51.0% vs 44.7%), older (average age, 63.9 vs 18.5 years), and Black (35.9% vs 20.8%). In the primary analyses, 20.2% of metabolic syndrome patients died in the hospital, compared with 16.0% of controls (unadjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.39). In multivariable analyses, metabolic syndrome remained significantly linked with in-hospital death (aOR, 1.19). Compared with control patients, those with metabolic syndrome were also more likely to develop ARDS (12.0% vs 20.1% [aOR, 1.36]).

Greater need for oxygen support
-------------------------------
Patients in the metabolic syndrome group needed more oxygen support in the form of supplemental oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, or high-flow oxygen and invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation than the control group.

Additional subgroup analyses found that, relative to patients with no underlying metabolic syndrome-related condition, those with one such condition had significantly higher rates of ARDS if they had prediabetes or diabetes, high blood pressure, and abnormal cholesterol levels, but the opposite was seen for patients with obesity.

In a Mayo Clinic press release, senior author Rahul Kashyap, MBBS, of Mayo Clinic, said that the results have important implications. "These findings will assist with efforts for creating national infrastructures for identifying critical illness risk factors and testing novel/repurposed medications to help improve patient outcomes," he said.

[5] USA: Pfizer Paxlovid, FDA emergency use approval
Date: Wed 22 Dec 2021
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) News [edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/12/fda-approves-pfizers-covid-19-pill-emergency-use


Today [22 Dec 2021], the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for emergency use Pfizer's Paxlovid, the 1st oral pill meant to treat mild-to-moderate COVID-19 infection in patients who are at high risk of progressing to severe illness.

The pill is authorized for patients ages 12 and older and should be started within 5 days of COVID-19 symptom onset. It could be available for US doctors to prescribe in a matter of days.

The drug is highly effective: earlier this year [2021] Pfizer shared study results that showed a 30-pill regimen reduced the risk of hospitalization or death by 88% in unvaccinated patients, and newer data suggest it is effective against the omicron variant.

Last week [week of 13 Dec 2021], the White House confirmed that the federal government had ordered enough Paxlovid to treat 10 million Americans.

"This authorization provides a new tool to combat COVID-19 at a crucial time in the pandemic as new variants emerge and promises to make antiviral treatment more accessible to patients who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19," said Patrizia Cavazzoni, MD, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, in a press release [https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-first-oral-antiviral-treatment-covid-19].

Supply will be limited through January [2022]
---------------------------------------------
Though the development adds another tool in America's medicine cabinet, White House chief medical adviser Anthony Fauci, MD, said today [22 Dec 2021] the drug is difficult to make.

"The sobering news is it is a quite complicated and synthetic process, and there's a long duration to make the drug," said Fauci during a White House press briefing.

Paxlovid is taken as 3 pills, taken together orally twice a day for 5 days. The regimen includes 2 tablets of nirmatrelvir, and 1 tablet of ritonavir, an HIV medicine. Paxlovid is not authorized for use for longer than 5 consecutive days. The drug is not meant to be taken prophylactically.

30 pills cost USD 530 per patient. According to the New York Times, only enough pills to cover 65 000 Americans would be available before the end of the year [2021], with another 200 000 treatment courses available in January [2022].

The news comes with US cases surging. The United States reported 172 072 new COVID-19 cases yesterday [21 Dec 2021], and 2093 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker.

Rochelle Walensky, MD, MPD, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said the 7-day daily average of cases was 149 000 cases, a 25% increase from the previous week.

Walensky and Fauci both urged caution when considering upcoming holiday plans. Gatherings with families and friends with known vaccination status are likely safe, they said, but large parties with upwards of 50 people are more risky.

Both Walensky and Fauci said pre-party at-home testing could be a good tool for people to use to gather safely, but pharmacy chains Walgreens and CVS announced yesterday [21 Dec 2021] that they will limit the number of at-home COVID-19 tests people can buy as demand for the products surges, CNN reports. [https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/cumulative-cases].

Omicron could boost booster uptake
----------------------------------
Throughout the White House press briefing, Walensky and Fauci emphasized that getting vaccinated and boosted was still the best way for Americans to protect against severe COVID-19 illness, hospitalization, and death. Though omicron is expected to raise the number of breakthrough cases significantly, most of those will be asymptomatic or mild.

The CDC COVID Data Tracker shows 61.6% of Americans are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, 72.6% have received one dose of vaccine, and 30.4% of fully vaccinated Americans have received a booster dose. [https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total].

Half of US adults who have not yet received a booster dose say the news about the omicron variant makes them more likely to get one, according to the latest Kaiser Family Foundation poll. But 87% of unvaccinated adults say omicron has not changed their mind about vaccination [https://tinyurl.com/yckpck7z].

Half of the unvaccinated adults said nothing could convince them to get vaccinated, while 12% said they would get vaccinated after more research, and 6% would if it was mandatory.

Several states and cities have taken up new vaccine mandates in light of omicron. California Gov. Gavin Newsom said yesterday [21 Dec 2021] that he will require that all healthcare workers in the state get their booster shot, ABC News reports [https://abcnews.go.com/Health/live-updates/coronavirus/?id=81852482#81884656]. And Chicago will require proof of coronavirus vaccination at restaurants, bars, gyms, and other indoor venues, the Associated Press reports. The requirement will take effect on 3 Jan 2022 [https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-business-health-chicago-lori-lightfoot-62a4f53b79d6728815483d9abbe5ffce].

- New data released by the CDC show that COVID-19 was the nation's 3rd leading killer in 2020 behind cancer and heart disease, and was the underlying cause of about 351 000 deaths, the Wall Street Journal reported today [22 Dec 2021]. Americans' life expectancy fell 1.8 years in 2020 [https://www.wsj.com/articles/life-expectancy-in-u-s-declined-1-8-years-in-2020-cdc-says-11640149261].
