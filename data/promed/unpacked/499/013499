A First Nation in northern Ontario said on Thursday [25 Nov 2021] that it requires additional services as it grapples with a suspected outbreak of lung infections in dozens of residents, including 3 deaths.

Constance Lake First Nation, a community of over 900 residents, declared a state of emergency on Monday [22 Nov 2021] after probable cases of blastomycosis and 3 recent deaths came to light. In a news release, the First Nation said it has reported 44 cases -- including 8 in children -- under investigation for the lung infection, which is typically caused by a fungus that grows in moist soil, leaves and rotting wood. Symptoms range from a mild cough to serious breathing problems. It said 16 of these cases required members to be hospitalized.

In a virtual update on Wednesday evening [24 Nov 2021], Constance Lake First Nation Chief Ramona Sutherland said one person has been confirmed to have a case of blastomycosis and has been transferred out to a hospital in a different community. She said another 13 people have probable cases of the infection.

As the community deals with what Sutherland called a "tremendous loss and community crisis", she said additional services are required. "We require services such as emergency housing inspections, additional site assessments, grief/mental health counselling, support for family members of sick individuals, and resources to help [alleviate] fears of our people, to name a few. Due to our low standard of living, we need these resources IMMEDIATELY," she wrote in the news release. "We need to work closely and hold Federal and Provincial Governments accountable during this time of crisis and we ask our neighbouring communities and partners to help support us in our time of need."

Indigenous Services Canada (ISC) has said it's working directly with Sutherland, the Porcupine Public Health Unit, the Ontario government, the Matawa Chiefs Council and other partners to "identify and address community needs". The federal department also noted that a representative from ISC arrived in the community Tuesday [23 Nov 2021] to provide on-the-ground support, and additional nursing, mental health and crisis support may be provided.

Dr Kieran Moore, Ontario's chief medical officer of health, called the outbreak in the community "quite disconcerting" and said it may be a result of climate change. "This is a very rare infection. To have the numbers of cases that have occurred in that community is quite startling," he said. Moore said the province has brought in multiple resources to "bear and support the community, from the laboratory system, from the healthcare system in the Hearst hospital, to enhancing the access to infectious disease experts, both pediatric and adult, and to ensure that the community is getting appropriate screening, testing, as well as access to treatment."

He also noted that experts have been brought in to conduct an environmental health investigation to find out how the community may have been exposed to blastomycosis. "This is a rare fungus that is typically found in soil or on decaying materials such as wood, and it may be a sign of further climate change to have a community that far north, starting to have blastomycosis," Moore added. "Typically, blastomycosis needs certain temperatures, it typically stays around the Great Lakes and down the Mississippi Valley. And to have it this far north in a large outbreak is very disconcerting."

Currently, there are at least 11 sites in and around the community where samples will be gathered to detect the source of the fungus suspected of causing infections, including the site of a recent fire, a lumber mill, 2 lakes, and a school on the reserve.

[Constance Lake First Nation is an Oji-Cree First Nations band government located on the shores of Constance Lake near Hearst, Cochrane District in north eastern Ontario, Canada; Constance Lake First Nation is home to close to 1605 members of Cree and Ojibway ancestry with approximately 820 living on reserve (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constance_Lake_First_Nation). Lecours Lumber Company Ltd, which operates a sawmill located in nearby Calstock on a long-term federal lease, is the main employer of the community (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constance_Lake_First_Nation). "Chronic housing shortages, low education outcomes and lack of access to clean drinking water jeopardize the ability of local First Nations to benefit from the significant economic, employment and business development opportunities associated with the Ring of Fire developments" (a massive, planned chromite-mining and smelting development project) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constance_Lake_First_Nation).

The following is extracted from my moderator comments in ProMED post Blastomycosis - USA: (WI) tubing, RFI 20150802.3553390:

"Blastomycosis is a potentially fatal infection caused by the soil-based dimorphic fungi _Blastomyces dermatitidis_ [or _Blastomyces gilchristii_], which exist in the environment at ambient temperature as a mold and in the animal host at body temperature as a yeast. The fungus likely resides in moist soil with decomposing organic debris. It appears that only under quite specific conditions of humidity, temperature, and nutrition can the fungus grow and produce the infecting spores. The spores become airborne when soil in which the fungus is growing is disturbed. Fungal spores may be inhaled and initiate an acute or chronic lung infection, which, if untreated, may disseminate to the skin, bone, joints, urinary tract, prostate, and brain. The incubation period can range from 3 weeks to 3 months, but many infected people remain asymptomatic.

"The diagnosis of blastomycosis is based on isolation of _Blastomyces dermatitidis_ from specimens obtained from sputum, skin, or tissue biopsy (growth of organisms in cultures may take at least 4 weeks), or the demonstration of characteristic broad-based budding yeast cells by direct microscopic examination of wet unstained clinical specimens, cytology preparations, or histopathology slides. PCR-based assays may also be available to detect DNA of _B. dermatitidis_ in cultures or clinical specimens (http://jcm.asm.org/content/50/5/1783.full). The drug itraconazole is used to treat mild or moderate disease, and amphotericin B is used for patients with central nervous system involvement, patients who are severely immunocompromised, or patients who do not respond to itraconazole therapy (https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/46/12/1801/296953). Blastomycosis more commonly affects people involved with outdoor activities, in proximity to waterways (http://www.cdc.gov/Mmwr/PDF/wk/mm4528.pdf), and the symptoms may be more severe in people with a weakened immune system.

"The infection is endemic throughout much of the Midwestern USA, including the area on both the Canadian and US sides of the Great Lakes and the St Lawrence River valley. Most cases are sporadic, but clusters of cases have occurred in a close geographic area within a short period of time."

Blastomyces dermatitidis is endemic in the Canadian province of Manitoba (0.62 cases per 100 000 population) and the Kenora region of the province of Ontario (7.11 cases per 100 000 population) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2807253/). Constance Lake is almost 1000 km (621 miles) directly east of Kenora, Ontario (https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Kenora,+ON,+Canada/Constance+Lake+Indian+Reserve+No.+92,+Calstock,+ON,+Canada). Risk factors include either occupational (for example, farmers and construction workers) or recreational outdoor exposure in endemic regions to soil or dust clouds resulting from disruption of soil.

The reason for the outbreak in the Constance Lake First Nations community is not stated in the news report above. So far, the diagnosis of blastomycosis in most cases is suspected, but is said to have been confirmed in one case. The outbreak could be due to an increase in high-risk activities, an increase in exposure of certain segments of the population who are more susceptible to blastomycosis, or a change in climate that favors proliferation of this fungus in the environment. More information from knowledgeable sources about this outbreak would be appreciated. - Mod.ML
