Dengue fever kills 87, infects nearly 60 000 in Viet Nam
-----------------------
87 people have died in Viet Nam from mosquito-borne dengue fever since the
beginning of the year [2004], an increase of 64 per cent over the same
period in 2003, officials said on Thursday. The deaths were among nearly 60
000 reported infections, an 83 per cent rise year-on-year, said Tran Hung,
head of the health ministry's epidemiology department.
The worst affected provinces were in the southern Mekong Delta region,
where moist and humid conditions provide ideal breeding grounds for
mosquitoes. The region accounted for more than 95 percent of cases, Hung said.
Large outbreaks of the virus, which first appeared in Vietnam in 1969, tend
to occur every 3-5 years, according to health experts, and this year is
within the cycle of heavy infection. Experts have also blamed an unusually
lengthy spell of hot and humid weather for the increased infection rate.
Health authorities have launched clean-up campaigns to eliminate stagnant
water to prevent mosquitoes from breeding. They have also set up mobile
emergency teams to treat victims.
