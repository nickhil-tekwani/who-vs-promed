Vietnam: Suspected Enterovirus Involvement in Childhood Deaths
-----------------------------------------------------
At least 10 Vietnamese children aged under 3 years have died in the past
month from an unidentified virus that is suspected to belong to the
enterovirus group, state-run media reported on Tue 8 Apr 2003. The cases
are believed to be unrelated to the flu-like severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) that has swept through many countries, killing 4 medical
workers in Vietnam.
The Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper said the 10 deaths were reported among 11
children admitted into Ho Chi Minh City's Children Hospital One. They all
had high fever, diarrhea, fell into comas, and developed respiratory and
heart failure. The latest death on Monday was of a 16-month-old child who
died 11 hours after being admitted. Doctors were working to identify the
virus that they suspected may belong to the 'enterovirus' group, which
infects the intestines and causes paralysis, vomiting, and diarrhea, the
paper said. It quoted Dr. Tang Chi Thuong, the hospital deputy director, as
saying the patients did not respond to resuscitation efforts and died
quickly. Tests for known viruses, including the one that causes Japanese
encephalitis, were negative, he said. Officials and doctors at the hospital
declined comment.
The first death from the mystery illness occurred in early March 2003 in
the same hospital in Vietnam's largest city, which has a population of 7
million people. Enterovirus killed 50 children and hospitalized another 253
in Taiwan in 1998, and deaths from the disease were also reported in
Australia in 1999.

[An extensive outbreak of Human enterovirus 71 infection was reported in
Sarawak in February 2003 (see: Human enterovirus 71 - Malaysia (Sarawak)
20030403.0815). The molecular epidemiology reported by Dr. Cardosa and
colleagues suggested that a new variant (sub-genogroup) of Human
enterovirus 71 may spreading in the Asia-Pacific region. Human enterovirus
71 infection is associated normally with hand, foot and mouth disease in
children, but occasionally can be responsible for neurological disease in
an appreciable number of children. Human enterovirus 71 was responsible for
the outbreak in Taiwan in 1998 referred to above, and presumably the same
virus is suspected as the cause of the current outbreak in Vietnam. A
precise diagnosis is awaited. - Mod.CP]
