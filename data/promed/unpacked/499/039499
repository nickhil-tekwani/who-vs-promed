[2] Summaries
- Tue 27 Nov 2018. 2 more Ebola cases, 1 death recorded in DRC; total stands at 421
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2018/11/news-scan-nov-27-2018

Today [27 Nov 2018] the ministry of health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) reported 2 more Ebola cases in the ongoing outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces. The outbreak total now stands at 421 cases (374 confirmed and 47 probable), including 241 deaths [see MoH report above].

The 2 new cases are from Kyondo and Kalunguta, and 1 additional death was recorded in Beni. 74 cases are still under investigation.

A ring vaccination campaign is still under way throughout the region. A total of 36 612 people have been vaccinated with Merck's unlicensed Ebola vaccine, including 17 465 in Beni.

If the outbreak reaches 426 Ebola cases -- which is highly likely soon -- it will become the 2nd largest in history, behind Uganda's 2000 outbreak (425 cases) and the massive 2014-2016 outbreak in West Africa (28 652 cases).

[The outbreak is not following the trajectory one would expect with the implementation of vaccination of contacts of infected patients. This is largely a result of the hazard of working in the region making identification of contacts and vaccination difficult with the unpredictable violence.

- Tue 27 Nov 2018. WHO: Ebola virus disease DR Congo Disease update news for 22 Nov
[WHO Emergencies preparedness, response, Disease Outbreak News (DONs), abridged, edited]
http://www.who.int/csr/don/22-november-2018-ebola-drc/en/

Containing the ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is a complex and challenging task but WHO remains confident that the outbreak can be successfully contained in collaboration with the Ministry of Health (MoH) and partners.

On 16 Nov 2018, an armed group attacked the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) base in the Boikene district, in the city of Beni, close to the UN Ebola response residences. Response operations in Beni were briefly paused but all activities, including vaccination, resumed by 18 Nov 2018. WHO condemns the attacks on peacekeepers who are integral to the ongoing efforts to manage the EVD outbreak. WHO will continue to evaluate the situation and risks involved, and remain vigilant about measures to protect responders and civilians.

Health centres have been identified as a source of disease transmission. Medications administered via injections were a notable cause of infection. Current efforts are focused on improving infection prevention and control (IPC) measures, including providing water and products for cleaning, training health providers at informal health centres and encouraging the provision of medications which do not require injections.

The overall trends in weekly case incidence reflect continued community transmission in several cities and villages in North Kivu (Figure 2). Given the expected delays in case detection and ongoing data reconciliation activities, trends, especially in the most recent weeks, must be interpreted cautiously.

The risk of the outbreak spreading to other provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as to neighbouring countries, remains very high. Over the course of the past week, alerts have been reported from Uganda and Zambia; EVD has been ruled out for all alerts to date.

Figure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by health zone in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo, data as of 20 Nov 2018 (n=386)

Figure 2: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset, data as of 20 Nov 2018 (n=382)*

* Onset date unknown for 4 cases. Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning - trends during this period should be interpreted cautiously.

[Health centres as a source of virus transmission needs to be addressed with education and/or provision of appropriate personal protective wear for doctors, nurses, and all staff working in the centers, as well as education on how the virus spreads, and implementation of quarantine practices to the degree possible. This may be difficult to accomplish, but without best practices, the virus will continue to spread. Vaccination of health care workers also would be a good step to take. - Mod.LK]

- Sat 24 Nov 2018. Ebola case count tops 400 in DRC, with 231 fatalities [now 241]
[Africa Times, abridged, edited]
https://africatimes.com/2018/11/24/case-count-tops-400-in-drc-ebola-outbreak-with-231-fatalities/

The spread of the Ebola virus outbreak in Democratic Republic of Congo has now surpassed 400 [421 cases as of 26 Nov 2018 -- see MoH report in [1] above] confirmed or probable cases, the country's Ministry of Health reported on [Sat 24 Nov 2018]. Another 56 cases are suspected and under investigation.

That means dozens of new cases in the last 2 weeks, with spikes seen in the communities of Kalunguta, increased to 41 from 9 cases, and Katwa [North Kivu], which has 39 cases and wasn't yet listed 2 weeks ago. That overall list of affected communities has grown to 11 in North Kivu province and 3 in Ituri.

The death toll stands at 231 [now 241], nearly half of them in the Ebola outbreak hotspot of Beni.

The risk of the outbreak spreading to other provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as to neighboring countries, remains very high," WHO said in its update. The region of DR Congo facing the outbreak also deals with chronic security and humanitarian crises, with a million people displaced and significant risk they may cross borders into South Sudan, Uganda, and Rwanda. So far reports of suspected cases in other countries, including Zambia, have been false alarms.

Preparedness efforts continue in 9 regional countries, where about 120 health experts have been deployed. The outbreak risk level remains high in the region but is considered low for global spread.

[3] Challenges: Battle against Ebola in Congo pits medical hope against local chaos
Date: Tue 27 Nov 2018
[New York Times, abridged, edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/27/health/ebola-outbreak-congo.html
[Byline: Donald G McNeil Jr]

The battle against Ebola now underway in central Africa is like no other. It is the 1st for which doctors have both a promising vaccine and treatments to offer. These medical innovations are experimental, but the vaccine seems to work well, the 4 new treatments have given preliminary hints of curative powers and a clinical trial of them began [Mon 26 Nov 2018].

It had seemed, with the help of these new tools, that the outbreak was headed for a quick end. Instead, with 419 cases and 240 deaths, it is now the 2nd deadliest ever (although the 2014 West African one was orders of magnitude larger, with over 28 000 cases and 11 000 deaths).

Dr Peter Salama, the WHO's emergency response chief, recently said he expected this outbreak to last at least another 6 months. That's because it is unique in another way: it's the 1st to erupt in an area rived by gun battles. Doctors and other experts currently or formerly working in the region described a landscape that is not quite a war zone but in which shooting can break out almost anywhere for unknown reasons.

The traumatized population is a mix of local residents, 4 million internally displaced people and 500 000 refugees from other countries. They speak many languages and often distrust outsiders -- including the national government and its army and police.

Some residents refuse to believe that Ebola exists or dismiss it as a foreign plot to test new medicines on Africans. Many simply see it as a lesser threat than the constant ones: malaria, cholera, hunger, and violence.

[4] Response. Butembo: an intense mobilization of women against the transmission of Ebola
Date: Tue 27 Nov 2018
Source: Radio Moto Butembo-Beni [in French, machine trans., edited]
http://radiomotofm.info/lirearticle.php?billet=5116


Butembo women's organizations held a press briefing on Tue 27 Nov 2018. This session focused on sensitizing women to stop the chain of transmission of the Ebola virus disease. One of the meeting rooms of the Welcome Center Joli Rêve was the setting for this meeting with the press.

During her presentation, Ms Cathy Furaha advised all women to be on maximum alert if a suspicious case arises around them. This, for referral to the nearest health facility or Ebola treatment center, ETC, for prompt management. "We are asking all women to monitor everyone in the community who has signs and symptoms of the disease and refer them to the nearest health facility or Ebola treatment center. If we get to the ETC quickly, we have 80 percent survival," she said, adding that the ETC is the only place in the world where there are 4 types of treatment for Ebola.

It should be noted that these women in Butembo say they have become aware that they are more vulnerable in this epidemic since they are close to the sick.
