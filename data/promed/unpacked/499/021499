South Africa Steps Up War Against Foot-And-Mouth Disease
------------------------------------------------------------
South Africa's veterinary authorities have ordered the cordoning-off of a
huge area to ensure that 3 million cloven-hoofed animals will be vaccinated
to prevent the further spread of foot-and-mouth disease in KwaZulu-Natal.
Up to now there has only been a 30-km control zone around the
Camperdown-Georgedale area where the disease broke out 2 months ago. But
the new area encompasses almost a third of the entire province.
The disease control centre in Pietermaritzburg said nobody would be allowed
to move any cloven-hoofed animal, any product of cloven-hoofed animals or
any kitchen refuse in or out of the zone, with immediate effect.
The directive will last until further notice. It said that branding to
ensure traceability would identify all vaccinated animals. "Surveillance
activities inside and outside the area will be intensified and broadened,"
it added.
The disease broke out on a pig farm at Camperdown 2 months ago and despite
hopes that it had been contained, new infections were discovered over the
past couple of weeks. So far almost 7000 animals have been put down since
the disease was first detected and 17 countries have imposed partial or
complete bans on the export of cloven-hoofed animals or products from South
Africa or KwaZulu-Natal.
Dr Kraai van Niekerk, Democratic Alliance Spokesman called on the Minister
of Agriculture and the government to institute a state of emergency in
order to control the disease. "This outbreak of foot and mouth is
everybody's problem and co-operation is needed to fight it. These efforts
will only be successful if the agriculture community is fully involved in
the efforts. "Internationally renowned experts should also be called in to
join scientists in taking over the fight against foot-and-mouth," he said.

Foot and mouth threatens wildlife: Africa
-------------------------------------------
JOHANNESBURG, Nov 14 (Reuters) - South Africa's vital wildlife tourism
could be threatened by an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease affecting
livestock, a conservation official said on Tuesday. "We have major concerns
about the possibility of this disease infecting wildlife in the province,"
Derek Potter, head of conservation west, covering western KwaZulu-Natal
province, told Reuters in an interview.
More than a million domesticated animals will be vaccinated in the province
after an intensive culling programme failed to stem a 2-month outbreak
among cloven-hoofed livestock. If the outbreak spreads to wildlife,
officials said it would have devastating consequences for KwaZulu-Natal's
multi-million dollar tourism, hunting and game ranching industries. "We are
paying particular attention to prevent it from entering our buffalo
reserves and populations," Potter said. Buffalo can become maintenance
carriers or hosts -- which means the disease may not infect them [cause
disease, but will never leave them. As a result, an infected herd must be
culled.
"We are working together with the department of animal health to set up an
early warning surveillance system in and around our wildlife reserves so we
can act quickly if we detect any sign of the disease," Potter said.
Concerns about the outbreak prompted Spanish authorities last month to
prevent a shipment of giraffe and rhino from South Africa from entering
Spain. The 22 giraffes and 3 rhinos spent 40 days at sea circumnavigating
the continent, arriving back in South Africa on Monday. [See next report
Only cloven-hoofed animals can be affected by the highly contagious viral
infection. Among African wildlife, giraffe, warthog and all species of
antelope are cloven-hoofed and therefore at risk. "An impala antelope is an
indicator species ... it will show the clinical signs more readily than any
other animal," Potter said. Elephant, rhinoceros, and hippopotamus would
not be affected, nor carnivores, such as lion or leopard.

Spain may be sued over giraffe deaths
---------------------------------------
The Spanish Government is facing legal action for damages after the death
of 2 giraffes on board a container ship bound for South Africa. Spain
refused to allow a wildlife consignment to enter its waters because of
fears about foot-and-mouth disease. The 2 giraffes died in their wooden
crates 7 days after the vessel left Malta. It is thought they may have
fallen over after becoming seasick and were trampled to death by other
giraffes in the crates.
They were among a consignment of 3 rhinos and 24 giraffes which left South
Africa on 5 Oct 2000 for the 3-week journey to Valencia. The surviving
animals have been at sea for more than a month and are not expected to
arrive [back in South Africa until 19 Nov 2000.
Global Wildlife Logistics, the Ladysmith company that handled the shipment,
said it had received a radio message from the ship's captain that the
giraffes had died on the way to Madagascar. [Presumably since leaving Malta.
They have been at sea for far too long," a spokesman said. "We hold the
Spanish Government responsible. We have taken on enormous costs to bring
the animals back. The alternative was to throw them in the sea."
The Spanish authorities turned back the animals because of a serious
outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease near the port city of Durban and after
claiming that blood tests showed that some of the animals may have been
carrying the deadly disease.
Jeff Richmond, managing director of Global Wildlife Logistics, said that
the Spanish fears were groundless and that they had ignored South African
veterinary certification that the animals were healthy. An appeal fund has
been set up to pay for the return of the animals.

[Switching from slaughter to vaccination is a major policy change and
signals a shift from rapid eradication to a slower process as demonstrating
freedom from FMD after vaccination is a long drawn out affair. The
scientific basis of the Spanish decision to deny landing to these rhinos &
giraffes is unclear as they would have had any necessary blood samples and
blood test results before the shipment left Natal, much less approached
Spain. At this time there are no reports of any wildlife cases in KwaZulu
Natal. - Mod.MHJ
