For 2 weeks already, the population of the community of Bakongola, Ovudu grouping, Kimbombo territory in Maniema has suffered from this rare epidemic named monkeypox.

Monkeypox, a rare disease, is caused by the simian pox virus (monkeypox) which is structurally related to smallpox and causes a similar disease, but less severe. It is part of the group of _orthopoxviruses_.

The residents who contacted the editorial staff of Netic-News are launching a cry of alarm to the authorities because the situation is becoming more and more serious.

[The above report provides little information about this outbreak or if monkeypox has been laboratory confirmed. The total number of cases is not provided. The reported case fatality rate for monkeypox in the DR Congo has been highly variable.

In the previous report in September 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 69 additional suspected monkeypox cases in August 2021 in the DR Congo, with a cumulative total from the beginning of the year [2021] to 8849, a monkeypox death for 2021 of 69 for a case fatality rate (CFR) of less than1% (see Monkeypox - Africa (06): Congo DR 20210924.8698685). Other reports have stated that the CFRs have ranged from 3.7% - 10%. If the 10 fatalities mentioned in the above report are indeed due to MPX virus infections, the total number of cases is likely to be 100 to over 1000.

The above report does not provide specific dates or details of the circumstances of where and when the infections occurred. ProMED-mail would be very interested in receiving further information about this outbreak. - Mod.TY
