FERAL CAT CONTROL (5)
=====================

I hope it goes without saying that the cats that are captured (after
having bitten, scratched or otherwise exposed a person or pet) are
not disposed of before rabies status is determined unless a bite or
scatch from a feral cat is considererd enough of a reason to go
ahead with post exposure rabies prophylaxis in a person or booster
an actively immunized pet for which there is an approved rabies
vaccine. The reason for my concern is related to what we are going
through all over NYS as far as rabies (raccoon strain)...as you are
probably aware, cats are a major problem and concern with regard to
human exposures.

I have no statistics nor study data, but we spay/neuter many cats each year.
This in no way stops their predation on wildlife as the owners report to
us.
My father, also a Veterinarian, spayed and declawed all 4 feet of a small
black and white cat we kept at the hospital in suburban Chicago. Our house
was 100 feet behind the hospital. This was also our pet cat. This cat would
climb 6 feet up a limbless Elm tree, bring back birds, mice and even young
rabbits. Being declawed and neutered in no way slowed nor prevented her
hunting/predation traits!

Not at all, they always maintain the hunting instinct (for wildlife
or maybe even a pet bird) that they had before being neutered.

Only if they have bells surgically implanted!
Seriously though, I feel this is a worthwhile program, and can help go a
long way towards reducing the spread of disease among feral cats,
reducing the population boom of feral cats in many areas, and helping
homeworthy cats find homes (while preventing the destruction of animals
that can't help being successful breeders in our country). I would
defend this program as worthwhile in some areas (urban and suburban
centers) and would be more in favor of relocation and/or destruction of
the beasties in areas with ecosystems more likely to be adversely impacted
by their continued presence (rural, park, and forest areas). I would be
happy to discuss this topic further with interested parties on or off
the listserv.

All of my cats have been neutered and all have continued to be hunter-
killers of birds,squirels, chipmonks, moles, though at times it seems
that they merely wish to "play" with them.

fenian@wco.com posted re feral cats, "While the county disposed of them for
free, we pay for the other."
There are neither genuinely "free" lunches nor "free" solutions to
animal control problems. The average per-animal cost to U.S. animal control
agencies last year for picking up about 7.5 million homeless dogs and cats,
impounding them for the requisite three to five days apiece to permit owner
reclaims, euthanizing the 5.1 million who were not reclaimed or adopted out,
and disposing of the remains was $60.19.

In many regions, two cats could be neutered and vaccinated for the
same expenditure. In most regions at least one could be.
Since feral cats tend to breed up to the carrying capacity of their
habitat, and do so very quickly, much faster than native competitor species
such as foxes and raptors, the fastest path to zero feral cats is not
catch-and-kill, which requires catching all (a practical impossibility),
but rather the replacement of a fertile population with an infertile
population, the gradual attrition of which tends to open habitat to
slower-breeding competitor species at the pace at which the competitor
species are able to take advantage of it.
Once again, for further information on the neuter/release method of
feral cat control, including detailed studies of homeless cat population
dynamics, cat feeder behavior, and the costs involved, we offer our free
information packet, prepared at the request of the National Animal Control
Association for distribution at the 1995 NACA annual conference, and
supplemented with additional research completed since that conference by the
National Pet Association and ANIMAL PEOPLE. Just send us your snail-mail
address.
We are not "in favor" of homeless cats, and we most certainly are
well aware of the harm they do to wildlife as well as the potential they have
to become a vector for zoonotic disease We are, however, in favor of what
really works to humanely reduce the numbers of homeless cats, in which
regard the traditional catch-and-kill method has been a hopeless failure,
whereas neuter/release, properly managed and supervised by responsible
humane agencies, has proved dramatically successful in South Africa,
England, and parts of the U.S. including San Francisco, the Santa Clara
Valley, and San Diego County. The statistics on the U.S. programs are in
our information packet. As we have previously pointed out, our research
indicates that only about 12% of the locations where feral cats are found are
genuinely suitable sites for a neuter/release program, but in such locations
nothing else works as well.
Incidentally, we've also found that 40% of the homeless cats live in
just 6% of the locations, and two-thirds live in 16% of the locations,
which indicates that the problem of having 26 million (winter) to 40 million
(summer) homeless cats is, though large, not so difficult to zero in on and
solve as might be thought at first glance.
