FDA warns consumers not to eat Viva brand cantaloupes
-----------------------------------------------------
The [United States Food and Drug Administration on Friday issued a warning
to consumers not to eat Viva brand cantaloupes imported from Mexico, saying
the melons have been linked to an outbreak of _Salmonella_ poisoning. The
agency also called on stores and restaurants to remove from stock any
cantaloupe of that brand. The FDA said it is detaining all cantaloupe
imported from two Mexican firms.
The agency said two deaths have been reported, along with numerous [cases
of illness in Arizona, California, Connecticut, Georgia, Hawaii,
Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, New Mexico, Nevada, New York, Oregon,
Tennessee and Washington state. The illness is caused by _Salmonella
poona_, an organism that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections
in young children, elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems.
Healthy people who are infected often experience fever, diarrhea, nausea,
vomiting, and abdominal pain.
The cantaloupe was sold in stores and restaurants and possibly served in
health care facilities, the FDA said. The cantaloupe was imported by
Shipley Sales Service of Nogales, Ariz., from the Mexican firms SPR De RI
Lugumbrera San Luis and SPR De RI Los Arroyos, the FDA reported. Viva was
the only brand associated with the outbreak. The FDA urged consumers to
purchase only fresh produce that is not bruised or damaged, keep it
refrigerated and wash all fruits and vegetables before eating. Fresh
cantaloupe has a shelf life of 14 to 18 days.
