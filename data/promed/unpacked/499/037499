From: Jose Luis Ferrero Albert <jferrero@cantv.net>

Six hundred and sixty cases of dengue fever have been reported in Zulia
State this year. [There were 285 cases for last week, and over 300 hundred
for the current week. Forty-nine cases were reported as DHF & 2 deaths have
occurred. Serotype 2 is suspected but not confirmed.
Concern has been expressed by the MSAS [health ministry authorities over
cases of dengue type 3 reported in Aruba, since this Caribbean island
maintains constant commercial activity with our country, especially with
Falcon and Zulia states. [Aruba is an island in the Netherlands Antilles -
Mod.JW
A health emergency has been officially declared, and efforts are being
directed at the elimination of all breeding sites for the mosquito, and
fumigation of the areas where most cases have been detected.
We have no official information regarding the rest of the country, but
there were small outbreaks in several states.
