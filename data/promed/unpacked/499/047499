A completely new species of bacteria has been discovered by scientists on a 64-year-old man in Cornwall [UK]. The unnamed patient went to his doctor with cellulitis, a common infection that can turn skin red, swollen, and hot to touch. Lab tests of a sample of his skin showed the bacterium responsible for his cellulitis had never been documented before but was similar to others. Researchers called the new strain of staph infection [_Staphylococcus] cornubiensis_, after the medieval name for the historic English county of Cornwall.

Evidence it is a new species was yesterday [11 Sep 2018] published in the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology [1]. Scientists at the University of Exeter Medical School and the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro found that it had not been reported before. They believe it is part of a group of bacteria known as _Staphylococcus_ SIG [_Staphylococcus intermedius_ group], usually passed onto humans from pet dogs.

It is unsure whether the patient owned a dog or had come into contact with one before his bout of cellulitis. Lead researcher Dr Aimee Murray said: 'We now need to know how prevalent this new species is in human infections.' She added they now want to determine whether owning pets may increase the chance of being infected with _S. cornubiensis_.

The SIG group of bacteria contains bacterial species: _S. intermedius_ and _S. pseudintermedius_. Both have been identified as potential zoonotic threats, meaning there is a risk of them spreading to humans from animals and causing infection. If an infection happens to be severe, bacteria in the SIG group are usually treated using antibiotics. However, resistance to common antibiotics is increasing in this bacterial group, alongside several other bacteria. Severe infections usually only occur in patients with weakened immune systems, making them more susceptible and less likely to fight off the infection.

Around one in 3 people carry staph bacteria harmlessly on their skin, figures suggest. SIG are types mainly found in animals. Staph bacteria only cause problems when they enter the body through cuts, grazes, or medical equipment. Although healthy people can be affected, those with weakened immune systems, such as due to a side effect of chemotherapy, are more likely to suffer.

Abstract
--------
"We here describe a novel species in the _Staphylococcus intermedius_ Group (SIG) which is phenotypically similar to _S. pseudintermedius_ but is genomically distinct from it and other SIG members, with an average nucleotide identity of 90.2 percent with its closest relative _S. intermedius_. The description of _S. cornubiensis_ sp. nov. is based on strain NW1T (=NCTC 13950T=DSM 105366T) isolated from a human skin infection in Cornwall, UK. Although pathogenic, NW1T carries no known virulence genes or mobilizable antibiotic resistance genes, further studies are required to assess the prevalence of this species in humans as well as its potential presence in companion animals."

_Staphylococcus intermedius_ Group (SIG) are coagulase-positive Gram-positive cocci that may be misidentified as _S. aureus_ in the clinical microbiology lab if molecular testing is not available; this may account for the fact that SIG infections in humans are rarely identified. SIG can be speciated by means of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/24807701/). SIG comprise 3 species: _S. intermedius_, _S. pseudintermedius_, and _S. delphini_. The reference journal article now reports an additional species within SIG.

Human infections with SIG have been reported to be usually acquired from pets, such as dogs or cats, which carry SIG. SIG has been reported to have acquired multi-antibiotic resistance similar to healthcare-associated methicillin-resistant _S. aureus_ (MRSA) and require special antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods and interpretation (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4767960/).

The patient in the news article above is reported to have "cellulitis", from which this new species of SIG was cultured. However, cellulitis is a skin infection from which an organism is notoriously difficult to culture, unless there is an associated open, infected wound. If no open wound is present, a positive skin culture may represent a superficial skin contaminant and not an invasive pathogen. - Mod.ML
