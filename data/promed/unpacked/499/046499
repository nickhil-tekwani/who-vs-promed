The Flemish Agency for Health and Safety reported (computer translated) that 5 of the 17 company cooling towers tested were positive for the bacterium _Legionella_. Two companies reported high values of the organism. Officials remind us that this does not mean that the source of the infection is known. The samples will now be genetically tested. In the remaining 12 company cooling towers tested, 10 were negative and 2 had different kind than the _Legionella pneumophila_ that made the people sick in this outbreak.

Joris Moonens, spokesperson for Care and Health: "We need to investigate further at these 5 companies whether they are the source of the infection. The 2 companies with higher values are the priority. But it is not because we found a high _Legionella_ value in a one-off sampling that we can be sure that one of these companies is the source of the contamination. To be sure of that, further laboratory research is needed." An inspection team will screen the cooling installations and water management in these 5 companies and investigate which factors in management or the environment may have contributed to the formation of _Legionella_.

To date, 23 _L. pneumophila_ cases have been reported in the outbreak, including 2 deaths.

[The news report confirms that the _Legionella_ species causing this outbreak is _Legionella pneumophila_, although the serogroup is not specified, and that 5 of the 17 cooling towers tested positive for _L. pneumophila_, 2 cooling towers in high titer. We are not told, however, if the positive cooling towers have been shut down or remediated.

We await genotyping results that will confirm if the genotypes of the clinical isolate match each other, which would indicate a common source outbreak, or if the genotypes of clinical isolates match the cooling tower isolates. The total number of cases has now risen to 23 with 2 deaths. - Mod.ML
