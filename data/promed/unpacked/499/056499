Salmonella outbreak linked to small turtles
-------------------------------------------

Fast facts
----------
Illnesses: 15
Hospitalizations: 5
Deaths: 0
States: 11
Investigation status: active

CDC and public health officials in several states are collecting different types of data to investigate a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella_ [enterica_ serotype] Stanley infections. Epidemiologic, laboratory, and traceback data show that contact with small turtles is making people sick.

Epidemiologic data
------------------
As of 19 Jul 2022, a total of 15 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ Stanley have been reported from 11 states (see map: https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/stanley-07-22/map.html). Illnesses started on dates ranging from 3 Jan 2022 to 24 Jun 2022 (see timeline: https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/stanley-07-22/epi.html). Sick people range in age from less than 1 year to 59 years, with a median of 7 years, and 71% of ill people are female. Of the 12 people with information available, 5 (42%) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

State / Number of sick people
-----------------------------
Florida / 1
Iowa / 1
Kansas / 1
Massachusetts / 1
New York / 1
Ohio / 2
Pennsylvania / 2
South Carolina / 1
Tennessee / 2
Virginia / 1
Washington / 2

The true number of sick people in an outbreak is likely much higher than the number reported, and the outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses. This is because many people recover without medical care and are not tested for salmonella. In addition, recent illnesses may not yet be reported, as it usually takes 2 to 4 weeks to determine if a sick person is part of an outbreak.

State and local public health officials are interviewing people about the animals they came into contact with in the week before they got sick. Of the 9 people interviewed, 8 (88%) reported touching turtles. Of the 7 people interviewed about the size of their turtle, 6 (86%) reported contact with a pet turtle with a shell less than 4 inches long. Of the 7 people interviewed about where they purchased their turtles, 6 (86%) reported purchasing their small turtles from online retailers. Of the 6 people who purchased their turtles online, 3 (50%) purchased from a website called myturtlestore.com.

Laboratory and traceback data
-----------------------------
Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. CDC PulseNet manages a national database of DNA fingerprints of bacteria that cause foodborne illnesses. DNA fingerprinting is performed on bacteria using a method called whole genome sequencing (WGS). WGS showed that bacteria from sick people's samples are closely related genetically. This means that people in this outbreak likely got sick from the same type of animal.

On 9 May 2022, the Tennessee Department of Health collected samples from 2 small turtles in a sick person's home for testing. These turtles were purchased from myturtlestore.com. WGS showed that the salmonella on the turtles and their environment are closely related to bacteria from sick people.

WGS analysis of bacteria from 14 people's samples, 3 turtle samples, and 3 environmental samples did not predict resistance to any antimicrobials. One person's sample showed resistance to tetracycline. Most people with _Salmonella_ illness recover without antimicrobials. However, if therapy is needed, this resistance is unlikely to affect the choice of antibacterial used to treat most people. Standard susceptibility testing by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory is currently under way.

Public health actions
---------------------
CDC advises that you always take steps to stay healthy around your pet turtle: wash your hands, play safely, and keep supplies and the pet area clean. Do not buy small turtles with shells less than 4 inches long, including online from myturtlestore.com.

------------------------------------------------------------------

"The prohibition on the sale and distribution of small turtles was enacted in 1975, after public health investigations demonstrated that small turtles were a major source of human salmonella infections, particularly in children. In 1972, a study in New Jersey indicated that small pet turtles accounted for approximately 23% of salmonella infections in children (4). In 1980, the 1975 prohibition was estimated to have prevented 100 000 salmonella infections in American children each year since going into effect (5). However, this prohibition has an exception: small turtles may be sold legally for scientific, educational, or exhibition purposes. During 2001-2006, the number of turtles kept as pets in the United States increased 86% to nearly 2 million turtles (6), suggesting that this exception might provide a mechanism by which small turtles become household pets.

"Turtles, like other reptiles, commonly carry salmonella, and fecal carriage rates can be as high as 90% (1). Small turtles sold as pets frequently come from breeding farms, where turtles are housed in crowded ponds and nesting areas in a way that promotes salmonella transmission (7). Attempts to treat turtles, turtle eggs, and turtle breeding ponds with antibiotics to eliminate salmonella have not been successful and have resulted in a high prevalence of antibiotic resistance (7,8). Other treatments reduce but do not eliminate shedding from turtles (8), and the turtles that continue to shed might re-contaminate other turtles during rearing or shipment. Because shedding might be intermittent and stress related, determining whether turtles are free of the bacteria is difficult (1).

"Direct or indirect contact with a reptile is associated with an estimated 6% of human salmonellosis in the United States (9). Persons coming into contact with reptiles, reptile habitats, or surfaces contaminated with reptile fecal matter risk infection from salmonellae shed by the reptile (10). Although most reptiles carry salmonella, small turtles are likely to be handled differently than other reptiles and thus carry a greater risk of transmitting salmonella to children. In contrast to the obvious risk for a bite or scratch, for example, from a snake or an iguana, a small turtle is likely to be perceived as safe, and thus might be given directly to small children to play with. In addition, a young child placed in charge of caring for a turtle has direct contact with water in the turtle habitat, where salmonellae are likely to multiply to high numbers. Although approximately half of the infections associated with this outbreak occurred in young children, who are at greater risk for severe illness from salmonellosis (2,10), several illnesses occurred in adults with turtle exposure, demonstrating that turtle-associated salmonellosis is not unique to children. Additionally, only 20% of case-patients interviewed reported awareness of the link between salmonellosis and contact with reptiles, indicating that measures to educate the public about this link have not been successful. CDC has provided recommendations to prevent reptile-associated salmonellosis in humans (2). However, because of the particular hazard associated with small turtles, prohibiting the sale and distribution of small turtles likely remains the most effective public health action to prevent turtle-associated salmonellosis."
