Hendra virus (HeV) update
-------------------------
Currently HeV [Hendra virus] infection remains confined to 2 known
properties in Queensland -- at a vet clinic at Redlands and at a
property at Prosperine. Another horse at each of these properties
tested positive for HeV overnight (night of 23 Jul 2008).

At Redlands, the horse could have been exposed via some of the other
infected horses and this possible exposure would fall within known
incubation times (median incubation period estimated at 10 days with
range 4-16 days). Once detected with a temperature on the morning of
23 Jul 2008, the horse deteriorated rapidly over the next 30 hours
and was euthanized on humane grounds. The remaining horses appear
healthy and are being monitored.

At Proserpine, a postmortem had been performed on the new positive
horse on 21 Jul 2008. Early positive results from these samples
became available overnight. The previously sick horse continues to
recover but will be monitored and sampled over time to determine if
exposure occurred. The remaining horses appear healthy.

Important points from current response
--------------------------------------
1. Important points for veterinarians to note from the HeV response to date:

a) The presentation of those horses at Redlands did not match the
known case definition for HeV. Interestingly, testing done to date
and some very early gene sequencing work, is indicating a slight
variation between the Redlands isolate and previous HeV isolates.
This work will be progressed.

b) Normal post mortem procedures and Personal Protective Equipment
use in practices may not protect people from becoming infected with
HeV. Both people who have tested positive to HeV were exposed to
close contact with sick horses and their body fluids and were not
protected using their routine precautions.

c) Veterinarians should now consider HeV amongst their possible
diagnoses for sick horses presenting with acute onset of disease,
fever, rapid progression to death or recovery (48 hours) accompanied
by either respiratory or neurological signs. Presence of bats in the
area is also supportive.

d) Flying foxes [_Pteropus_ spp. -- see photo URL below. - Mod.JW]
remain the known reservoir of HeV, and the presence of bats in the
same general area as infected horses remains a consistent finding.

Background
----------
2. On 7 Jul 2008, the principal veterinarian of a busy horse practice
advised the chief veterinary officer Queensland of unusual
neurological cases in horses at the practice. The presenting signs
included fever, acute onset, rapid progression, ataxia [Failure of
muscular coordination. - Mod.JW], head tilt, facial nerve paralysis,
and purple mucous membranes.

3. A total of 5 horses have been confirmed as being infected since
late June 2008. One of the horses had been euthanized and a thorough
postmortem undertaken over the weekend of 5-6 Jul 2008. The other
sick horses had also all received close veterinary care.

4. Due to the unusual nature of the disease situation, the clinic was
quarantined under the Stock Act 1915 on 7 Jul 2008. Biosecurity
Queensland veterinarians attended the practice and secured all
available samples, including postmortem samples and blood samples
from 3 of the recent cases.

5. At 10:30 am on 8 Jul 2008, Queensland Health advised of 2
presumptive positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results to
Hendra virus from the blood samples submitted. These results were
confirmed at 4:30 pm. Samples were dispatched to the Australian
Animal Health Laboratory in Geelong, where HeV has been confirmed and
subsequently 4 horses have been confirmed from Redlands with HeV.

6. The latest infected horse was euthanized on humane grounds when
[its] condition deteriorated rapidly. A thorough postmortem is
planned for this horse.

7. Coincidentally, another positive case of HeV was confirmed in a
horse that died 11 Jul 2008 near Proserpine. Of interest is that this
case matched the existing case definition that includes respiratory
signs and that testing and early gene sequencing work indicates this
virus is similar to previously known isolates. Investigations will
continue.

8. On the Proserpine property, another horse had died on 4 Jul 2008,
and in retrospect fitted a respiratory case definition for HeV. No
samples are available. Another horse on the property became sick with
signs fitting HeV case definition and was given a postmortem on 21
Jul 2008. Results are positive for this horse. Of the 3 remaining
horses on the property, one has been sick recently but appears to be
recovering and the other 2 appear healthy at this point.

9. The clinic in the Redlands remains under quarantine and a
serological testing program is underway on all surviving horses at
the clinic -- 36 in total. Only horses that test negative on the
serological neutralization test (SNT) can be considered to be free of
HeV. The duration of the quarantine will relate directly to the
results of these SNTs and the time since last possible exposure to
any infection.

10. HeV is a zoonotic disease and if there is any suspicion involving
a presenting case, the local Public Health Unit or your General
Practitioner should also be contacted as soon as possible.

11. The HeV Guidelines for Veterinarians available from the DPI&F
(Department of Primary Industries & Fisheries) website are now being
updated. Dr Chris Reardon is the AVA-EVA (Australian Veterinary
Association-Equine Veterinarians Australia) representative on the
group undertaking the update.

[2] Human cases

<http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14377-could-killer-horse-virus-spread-amongst-humans.html?DCMP=ILC-hmts&nsref=news2_head_dn14377>


Could killer horse virus spread amongst humans? The biggest outbreak
of Hendra virus to date is underway, and this time it might spread
among humans. Australia is suffering the biggest outbreak of the
highly virulent Hendra virus since the disease was identified in 1994.

Now a change in its signs in Queensland horses is raising fears that
new strains may have emerged -- and even that a strain capable of
spreading from human-to-human could appear.

"The different clinical presentations, and some very preliminary
[DNA] sequencing data, suggest that the Hendra virus may be somewhat
different in this outbreak," says epidemiologist Hume Field of the
Australian Biosecurity Cooperative Research Centre for Emerging
Infectious Diseases in Brisbane. "It all suggests that there may be a
cluster of Hendra virus strains, all closely related, but differing
in their pathogenesis and infectivity," he says.

To date, 2 people, both veterinary clinic staff, who became infected
roughly 4 weeks ago, remain in hospital. As many as 50 more people
who may have had contact with horses carrying the virus will undergo
a 2nd set of tests over the next few days.

Fruit-bat reservoir
-------------------
The natural reservoir for the Hendra virus is the fruit bat [see URL
for photo below], which carries the virus without becoming sick, but
it remains unclear how the virus "spills over" to horses.

"We are trying to understand why spill over occurs in some years, and
not others," says Field. "That way we can manage the risk better, and
prevent Hendra virus becoming an established disease of livestock or
humans."

Hendra virus was first identified in 1994, when 14 horses and one
person, a horse trainer, died in the Brisbane suburb of Hendra. A 2nd
person was infected, but recovered. In an outbreak that occurred a
few weeks before the index case, and was later recognized as Hendra,
2 horses died, as did their owner -- some 13 months after being
infected with the deadly virus.

But every subsequent outbreak until now has been contained, with the
virus infecting one horse each time. In one of those outbreaks one
person was also infected, but survived.

Symptoms in humans have included a flu-like illness, which can
progress to pneumonia; headache, high fever, and drowsiness, which
can progress to convulsions or coma. The Hendra virus has not been
identified outside of Australia.

[Currently, there are no vaccines for horses against Hendra virus. I
am unaware if any antivirals have shown any promise of working
against the virus or in the horse. - Mod.TG

According to the Institut de Veille Sanitaire (France) website as of
18 Jul 2008, 6 human cases of Hendra virus infection have been
confirmed (see
<http://www.invs.sante.fr/international/notes/hendra_180708.pdf>).

These human cases are listed in the following table in relation to
the known outbreaks of Hendra virus infection in horses in Queensland
and New South Wales.
