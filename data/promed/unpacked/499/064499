"... In 1997, 9911 malaria cases were officially recorded in Azerbaijan..."
******************
With regards to the request for information regarding malaria epidemic in
Azerbaijan please find the following information.
In April 1998, the WHO Regional Office for Europe assisted the MoH of
Azerbaijan, as well as MoH of Armenia, in preparing a project proposal for
the control of the malaria epidemic.
The projects were submitted to possible donors for financial support.
Unfortunately no international donors replied to the project proposal for
Azerbaijan, while the Norwegian and Italian Governments provided assistance
for malaria control in Armenia for 1998.
At this stage the Malaria control programme in Azerbaijan is assisted by
several NGOs (IFRC, MSF-B, MSF-H, UMCOR, OXFAM and AzRC), by UNICEF (which
provided drugs) and by ENI (Italian Petrol Company, which provided some >
insecticide).
The WHO Regional Office for Europe is coordinating the activities and is
looking for donors...
In 1997, 9911 malaria cases were officially recorded in Azerbaijan.
Epidemiological information on the incidence of malaria in Armenia for 1998
is still not available for distribution since malaria transmission [only
started in June.
Organizations that want support Azerbaijan on malaria control or needing
more detailed information can contact this Office.

Re:
>[For the geographically challenged, Armenia & Azerbaijan share a common
border, and in fact a piece of Armenia, called Nogorno-Karabakh, is
entirely surrounded by Azerbaijani territory. - Mod.JW
Please note that Nagorno Karabakh is NOT part of Armenia though Armenians
live there... [and Nagorno-Karabakh wants to be independent from
Azerbaijan and has declared its independence.
Disease-bearing mosquitoes from Armenia and from Azerbaijan [including
Nagorno-Karabakh know no geographic boundaries. The problem is serious for
all concerned. Don't lose sight of that fact. It's critical to the whole
region. There are no boundaries for mosquitoes and both Azerbaijan and
Armenia need help in eradicating the problem.
