A Lydia Hawk Elementary School 3rd-grader who caught a rare virus
while visiting family in Southeast Asia is recovering at Children's
Hospital in Seattle.

The boy, 9, traveled with his father and siblings to Viet Nam and
Cambodia in January [2008]. He was bitten by a mosquito and infected
with Japanese encephalitis [JE], a rare virus that's similar to West
Nile virus. Two weeks after the bite, he lost his appetite and got a
high fever, said his father, a man from Seattle.

The boy lost his ability to speak, suffers from tremors and can't sit
up on his own, the father said. "He cannot respond back. He cannot
move his body parts," he said.

But the boy is improving; he started sleeping through the night, and
his tremors are not as frequent, the father said Sunday [23 Mar
2008]. The boy also is starting to recognize people and voices. "He
understood e-mails from school. I can tell by his eyeballs moving
along the lines," the father said.

Japanese encephalitis is transmitted by mosquitoes and can cause mild
to severe infections marked by headache, high fever, neck stiffness,
coma, tremors and occasional convulsions and paralysis, according to
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The CDC recommends vaccination for travelers who will spend more than
a month in rural areas during the transmission season, which varies
by region. The risk during the transmission season is one per 5000.

The father said he was aware of the disease, but the vaccine was
expensive and needed to be done 2 months in advance; the family
planned their trip less than a month before. The boy had 3 other
vaccinations before his trip [to SE Asia?]. "We took a chance," the
father said.

He said it could take the boy 6 months to a year to recover, although
he might never fully recover.

When the boy became sick, his family flew him by air ambulance to a
hospital in Thailand. The boy and his father returned to Washington
[state] last week, accompanied by a nurse and doctor.

The father said the medical expenses have been hard on the family.
The 6-week hospital stay in Thailand cost USD 40 000, half of which
isn't covered by the travel insurance he purchased.

[JE virus is a flavivirus related to St. Louis encephalitis and West
Nile viruses. It is the major cause of viral encephalitis in Asia;
10-50 000 cases are reported annually. JE virus is maintained in an
enzootic cycle in Southeast Asia involving the _Culex
tritaeniorhynchus_ group of mosquitoes and wild birds. Ardeid wading
birds and pigs are amplifying vertebrate hosts. In endemic areas,
incidence in humans is one-10 per 10 000 population. Children under
15 years of age are at greatest risk of encephalitis. Infection
leading to encephalitis in travelers from the USA and other western
countries is rare. There have been 11 USA residents and 13
individuals from other western countries with encephalitis from JE
virus infection since 1981. Summaries of JE virus, its epidemiology
and available vaccines can be found on the US CDC website:
