The Florida Department of Health has reported 20 _Vibrio vulnificus_ cases through [Fri 3 Sep 2021] which includes cases in the following counties: Duval, Escambia (3), Hernando, Hillsborough (2), Lee (2), Leon, Manatee (2), Orange, Palm Beach, Polk (2), Santa Rosa (2), Seminole and Taylor. The death toll remains at 7 - Manatee (2), Duval, Escambia, Lee, Orange, and Polk counties. In 2020, Florida reported 36 cases and 7 deaths.

The CDC reports most _Vibrio_ infections result in only diarrhea and vomiting. However, some infections, such as those caused by _Vibrio vulnificus_ which can be contracted from eating raw shellfish or via an open wound, can cause more severe illness, including bloodstream infections and severe blistering skin lesions. Many people with _V. vulnificus_ infections require intensive care or limb amputations, and 15-30% of infections are fatal.

[The following is extracted (and abridged) from the "Bad Bug Book," 1st edition, Center for Safety and Applied Nutrition, US FDA (Food and Drug Administration), at https://bit.ly/3Cohttr:

"_Vibrio vulnificus_, a lactose-fermenting, halophilic, Gram-negative, opportunistic pathogen, is found in estuarine environments and associated with various marine species such as plankton, shellfish (oysters, clams, and crabs), and finfish. Environmental factors responsible for controlling numbers of _V. vulnificus_ in seafood and in the environment include temperature, pH, salinity, and increased dissolved organics."

"Wound infections result either from contaminating an open wound with seawater harboring the organism or by lacerating part of the body on coral, fish, etc. followed by contamination with the organism. The ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in gastroenteritis. The 'primary septicemia' form of the disease follows consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals with underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease [The organism can also enter through damaged skin. - Mod.LL]. In these individuals, the microorganism enters the bloodstream, resulting in septic shock, rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50%). Over 70% of infected individuals have distinctive bullous skin lesions" [shown at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5508923/ - Mod.LL].

There are 2 points to be emphasized: (1) Vibrios are normal flora in warm salt water (not indicative of any sewage contamination), and (2) most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. So-called normal individuals often just develop gastroenteritis. The range of disease due to _V. vulnificus_ may involve more northern geographical areas as overall global warming takes effect. - Mod.LL
