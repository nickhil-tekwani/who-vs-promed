[paraphrased by Mod CHC, with comments]

The pace of the Hendra-like virus epidemic in Malaysia does not appear to
be slowing. According to the Star newspaper, five more people have died in
Negri Sembilan. The report des not say whether they died from infection
with Japanese encephalitis (JE) flavivirus or from the newly recognizd
Hendra-like paramyxovirus.
CDC personnel have established a high-level biohazard laboratory at the
University of Malaysia to handle specimens and to identify isolates of the
paramyxovirus and to conduct studies to determine the mode of transmission
of this virus to humans.
The general population is being advised to seek immediate medical attention
if they are suffering from signs of disease, such as fever, headache or
dizziness. Apparently, ribavirin is being used successfully but only if
this antiviral drug is administered in the early stages of illness.
The Star newspaper provides information to farmers, truck (lorry) drivers,
and abbatoir workers regarding procedures to be used for self-protection
from the Hendra-like virus.
This newspaper report has a link to the Malaysian Department of Public
Health website, which provides a table showing number of cases and number
of deaths by state. However, the table provides information only regarding
suspect JE cases (166), confirmed JE cases (42), total number of cases
(208), and number of deaths (71). It is, therefore, unclear as to how many
cases of the Hendra-like virus have been diagnosed and how many of those
might be included in this table. Informal communications suggest that most
patients have been infected with the Hendra-like virus, rather than with JE
virus. This is yet to be confirmed.
There is concern on the part of all involved regarding the possibility of a
laboratory accident leading to an infection. Two people may possibly have
had finger-sticks with clinical material containing the Hendra-like virus;
they are being watched closely for signs of illness.
This appears to be a very nasty virus infection. Most hospitalized
patients are encephalitic, few have respiratory involvement as a principal
sign. It is not surprising that illnesses caused by the two viruses are
confused.
