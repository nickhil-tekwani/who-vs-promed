An outbreak of plague was found in the Kulinsky district of the republic [Russian federal subject] of Dagestan. As long as people are highly susceptible to the disease, immunizations will be conducted for the population to avoid mass infection. Restrictive measures will be taken on the territory of nearby villages.

Plague is a deadly infectious disease that is caused by _Yersinia pestis_, named after the French-Swiss bacteriologist Alexandre Yersin. Primarily carried by rodents (most notably rats) and spread to humans via fleas, the disease is notorious throughout history, due to the unrivaled scale of death and devastation it brought. Until June 2007, plague was one of the 3 epidemic diseases specifically reportable to the World Health Organization (the other 2 being cholera and yellow fever).

[The article does not specifically state that the outbreak involved people; reservoir "die-offs" can sporadically occur without human cases. - Mod.LL]

[The reservoir of plague in Dagestan is likely to be marmots (_Marmota_ spp., large ground squirrels), as in Mongolia. They are hunted for their fur, and hunters get bitten by their infected fleas, or infected from their blood when skinning them. For a photo, see:
