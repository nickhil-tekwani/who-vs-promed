Malaria: nearly 2000 cases every week in Kitchanga
--------------------------------------------------
At least from 1500 to 2000 cases of malaria have been registered each week in Kitchanga, Chief Mwesso health zone in Masisi (North Kivu province). The increase in malaria cases was observed in Area Kashuga, Mwesso health zone, before the increase was noted in the Kitchanga health facility.

The presence of large numbers of fish ponds in the area, serving as mosquito breeding sites, is suspected to be the cause of the increase. Mwesso health zone is stocked with medicines. A campaign promoting insecticide-treated nets in the local community is under way.

Dr Thiery Mbuyi Mukendi welcomed the support of provincial authorities and partners: "They supplied us with drugs and before that we also contacted the partner in the field, MSF [Médecins Sans Frontières], which helped us too by taking over cases in their Kitchanga health clinic. They supported us and even send us staff because if you try to see the severe cases it also requires qualified personnel. The government supplied us with the necessary drugs for the treatment of the cases."

The health zone, in cooperation with the authorities, is considering other preventive measures, especially the way the ponds are managed, or perhaps changing the species of fish to one that eats the mosquito larvae is a possibility. [Another measure is] to ensure the strict use of insecticide impregnated mosquito nets in the population.
