A new crop disease in Dagana
----------------------------
A disease called turcicum [leaf blight] has been affecting maize crops
in Dagana. Turcicum [leaf blight] affects the leaves and eventually
the husk. Wild boar and monkeys have been threatening their maize, but
now they have a new threat to the crop. The disease has been affecting
maize crops since 2 years ago.

"Previously we haven't heard of such disease. Our maize has been
affected by a disease recently. It affects the maize plant especially
when it is tender," said a farmer. "We have done everything to contain
the disease. But it has not been effective," said another farmer.
Maize is one of the main staple diets.

The district agriculture sector said the disease was detected
recently. It says fungicide should be sprayed if it is detected at an
early stage. The sector says the only solution to prevent the disease
is to change the seed. They are also assessing the damage caused so far.

[Turcicum leaf blight (TLB; also called northern leaf blight) of maize
is caused by the fungus _Setosphaeria turcica_ (previously
_Exserohilum turcicum_). It is a widespread disease of maize which can
cause yield losses of up to 70 percent. Different strains of the
pathogen affect sorghum and several grass species, but these do not
infect maize.

Symptoms include leaf spots which may form large necrotic areas and
kill entire leaves, affecting plant vigour. Lesions can form on husks
but ears are not visibly affected. Highest losses will occur with
infection before silking. In addition to yield loss, the disease also
causes qualitative changes in seeds resulting in decreased sugar
content and germination capacity. Severely infected plants are often
predisposed to stalk rots. TLB is more severe in cool humid regions
characterised by heavy dew.

The pathogen overwinters on leaves, husks, and other plant debris.
Spores are spread by wind over long distances and locally with
contaminated plant and other materials and by mechanical means.
Disease management may include cultural methods (ploughing under of
crop residues, crop rotation) and fungicides, but relies mainly on
resistant varieties or hybrids.

Host resistance is derived from qualitative and quantitative genes
acting together or separately. Qualitative resistance is typically
race specific and controlled by single genes whereas quantitative
resistance is not specific for race and controlled by multiple genes.
The suggestion of 'changing the seed' for disease control above may
refer to a change to cultivars with higher levels of resistance to TLB.

The disease appears to be spreading westwards in Asia (see map listed
below). It may be worth considering whether an undiagnosed disease of
maize with symptoms of 'leaf drying and burning', which was recently
reported from close-by Nepal (ProMED-mail post 20100901.3118) may also
be TLB.
