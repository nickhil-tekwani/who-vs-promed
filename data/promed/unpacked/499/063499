Human tuberculosis caused by _Mycobacterium bovis_ -- New York City, 2001-2004
--------------------------------------------------
In Mar 2004, a USA-born boy aged 15 months in New York City (NYC) died of
peritoneal tuberculosis (TB) caused by _Mycobacterium bovis_ infection. M._
bovis, a bacterial species of the _M. tuberculosis_ complex, is a pathogen
that primarily infects cattle. But humans also can become infected, usually
through consumption of unpasteurized milk products from infected cows. In
industrialized nations, human TB caused by _M. bovis_ is rare because of
milk pasteurization and culling of infected cattle herds (1).

This report summarizes an ongoing, multi-agency investigation that has
identified 35 cases of human _M. bovis_ infection in NYC. Preliminary
findings indicate that fresh cheese (e.g., queso fresco) brought to NYC
from Mexico was a likely source of infection. No evidence of human-to-human
transmission has been found. Products from unpasteurized cow's milk have
been associated with certain infectious diseases and carry the risk of
transmitting _M. bovis_ if imported from countries where the bacterium is
common in cattle. All persons should avoid consuming products from
unpasteurized cow's milk.

TB surveillance
---------------
Since 1 Jan 2001, spoligotyping of _M. tuberculosis_ complex isolates from
patients with newly diagnosed TB has been conducted routinely in NYC. This
rapid genotyping method is primarily used for epidemiologic monitoring;
however, spoligotyping also differentiates _M. bovis_ from _M.
tuberculosis_. Of 4524 TB cases reported in NYC during 2001-2004, a total
of 3417 (76 per cent) were culture-confirmed; 3123 (91 per cent) of these
had spoligotype results, of which 35 (1 per cent) were _M. bovis_. 12 (34
per cent) of the _M. bovis_ cases were in children aged <15 years (median:
5 years), and 5 of the 35 cases (14 per cent) were in children aged <5
years (range: 1-4 years). Of the 35 patients, 20 (57 per cent) were born in
Mexico, 11 (31 per cent) in the USA, 2 (6 per cent) in the Dominican
Republic, and 1 (3 per cent) each in Guatemala and Guyana. Of 23 adult
patients (median age: 27 years; range: 16-76 years), 22 (96 per cent) were
born abroad; of the 12 patients aged <15 years, 10 (83 per cent) were born
in the USA, all of Mexican-born parents. Of the 5 patients aged <5 years,
all had extrapulmonary disease (3 lymphatic and 2 peritoneal). All 5 were
born in the USA of Mexican-born parents. None had traveled outside of the
USA, and no epidemiologic link to other TB cases was discovered.

26 of the 35 patients received inpatient hospital care. The anatomical site
of disease was extrapulmonary in 21 (60 per cent) patients, pulmonary in 9
(26 per cent), and both pulmonary and extrapulmonary in 5 (14 per cent)
patients. The sputum-smear microscopy results were positive for acid-fast
bacilli, indicating potential contagiousness, for 8 (57 per cent) of the 14
patients with pulmonary disease. 25 (7 children and 18 adults) of the 35
patients were tested for antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
7 (28 per cent) of those tested had positive HIV results; all were adults,
aged 23-51 years (median: 35 years).

The only fatal _M. bovis_ case was in the boy aged 15 months. He was
treated for diarrhea and fever and received inpatient and outpatient care
for 4 weeks, until abdominal distension and tenderness led to laparotomy
for presumed ruptured appendicitis. Tuberculous peritonitis was diagnosed
on the basis of surgical and microbiologic findings, and treatment for TB
was begun. However, the boy died after 4 days of treatment.

During 1995-2004, the number of TB cases reported annually in NYC among
Mexican-born persons ranged from 28 to 64. During 2001-2004, a total of 20
(13 per cent) of 155 culture-confirmed TB cases in Mexican-born patients
were caused by _M. bovis_ infection, compared with 15 (<1 per cent) of 2925
TB cases (with spoligotype results) in all others. During 2001-2004, a
total of 101 TB cases in children aged <5 years were reported; 32 (32
percent) of the cases were culture-confirmed, and 5 (16 per cent) of the 32
culture isolates were _M. bovis_.

The standard 4-drug regimen for TB consists of isoniazid, rifampin,
pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. Since 2003, a 5th drug, streptomycin, is no
longer recommended as a 1st-line alternative to ethambutol (2)
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5211a1.htm>.

Whereas isolates of other species belonging to the _M. tuberculosis_
complex usually are susceptible to pyrazinamide, _M. bovis_ isolates
typically are resistant. In this investigation, of the 35 isolates, 17 (49
per cent) were resistant to pyrazinamide only; 14 (40 per cent) were
resistant to pyrazinamide and streptomycin; 2 (6 per cent) were resistant
to pyrazinamide, isoniazid, and streptomycin; 1 (3 per cent) was resistant
to pyrazinamide and isoniazid; and 1 (3 per cent) had no resistance.

Laboratory investigation
------------------------
Identification of the 35 _M. bovis_ isolates was confirmed by genetic
deletion analysis. Genotyping determined 9 different patterns by
spoligotype, 3 patterns (1-7 bands) by IS6110-based restriction fragment
length polymorphism (RFLP), and 6 patterns by mycobacterial interspersed
repetitive units (MIRU). A cluster of 13 cases had identical RFLP (BE4),
spoligotype (octal designation 264073777777600) (3), and MIRU
(232224253322) (for figure, see
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5424a4.htm#fig#fig>).

Genotyping with polymorphic guanine- and cytosine-rich repeat sequences
(PGRS) did not reveal additional clusters. The interpretation of _M. bovis_
genotypes for investigating paths of transmission has not been determined.

Epidemiologic investigation
---------------------------
Of the 35 patients, 23 (66 per cent) patients (or parents of patients) were
interviewed regarding exposures associated with _M. bovis_ infection. Among
the 12 not interviewed, 2 had died, 3 had moved back to Mexico, 5 had their
telephones disconnected and attempts to visit them at home were
unsuccessful, and 2 lacked usable locating information. Parents of the 10
USA-born children and 1 of the 2 children born abroad were interviewed, as
were 12 of 22 adults. No linkages that might allow airborne,
person-to-person transmission of _M. bovis_ were discovered among any of
the patients.

19 (83 per cent) of the 23 interviewed reported eating cheeses produced in
Mexico while they were living in the USA, including parents of 4 (80 per
cent) of the 5 children aged <5 years. The cheeses were believed obtained
from 1 or more of the following sources: a courier agency delivering
Mexican products, a visitor carrying food in luggage, a Mexican-specialty
grocery, or a door-to-door vendor in NYC. 18 (78 per cent) of the 23
interviewed did not know whether milk products they consumed were
pasteurized. Samples of cheeses produced in Mexico and acquired in NYC are
being tested for presence of _M. bovis_.

Editorial note:
---------------
_M. bovis_ transmission from cattle to humans was once common in the USA,
but human infections were virtually eliminated by decades of disease
control in cattle herds and by routine pasteurization of cow's milk (1).
Now the majority of persons who have _M. bovis_ TB come from countries
where the infection is prevalent in cattle and where they presumably
acquired infection. However, in San Diego, California, during 1980-1997, 34
per cent of culture-confirmed TB cases in children aged <15 years were
caused by _M. bovis_; approximately 90 per cent of these children were USA
born and of Hispanic ethnicity (4).

Fresh cheese brought from Mexico is suspected to be one source of
infections in these children. The investigation in NYC, where the Mexican
population tripled to 186 872 during 1990-2000, suggests that fresh cheese
from Mexico might account for a high percentage of the 35 cases described
in this report; however, further epidemiologic investigations and
laboratory results are needed for confirmation.

_M. bovis_ causes disease in cattle, deer, and other mammals. In humans,
consumption of unpasteurized infected cow's milk products can cause
infection. Although human disease caused by _M. bovis_ and other species of
_M. tuberculosis_ complex are similar, the anatomic site of _M. bovis_
disease is more often extrapulmonary. Epidemiologic evidence supports the
likelihood of human-to-human, airborne _M. bovis_ transmission from
patients who have pulmonary disease, but its relative contribution to new
infections in humans is unknown (5).

The frequency of isoniazid resistance in the cases described in this report
was comparable to that previously reported for _M. bovis_ in San Diego.
Streptomycin resistance, which had not been examined previously for _M.
bovis_ in the USA, was about 6 times more frequent among the cases in NYC
(16 of 35 isolates) than that reported for _M. tuberculosis_ complex
previously (6). Continued surveillance for drug resistance is needed to
ensure effective treatment.

TB disease is a reportable condition in all USA jurisdictions; however,
speciation of _M. tuberculosis_ complex is not reported nationally. About
80 per cent of cases in the USA are culture-confirmed. Systematic
speciation was not feasible until the advent of comprehensive genotyping.
_M. bovis_ also can be distinguished from other species of _M.
tuberculosis_ complex by its pyrazinamide resistance and by biochemical
tests available in reference laboratories; genetic deletion analysis
identifies _M. bovis_ definitively. The CDC national genotyping program for
TB isolates incorporates spoligotype and MIRU, with IS6110 RFLP upon
special request.

However, RFLP is poorly discriminatory for _M. bovis_, because isolates
usually have a low number of IS6110 copies. Spoligotype variability among
_M. bovis_ isolates from the same cattle herd and similar spoligotype
patterns from cattle in different regions have been observed (7). MIRU can
yield more patterns than RFLP (8). PGRS has been recommended as the method
of choice for strain typing of isolates with low copy numbers of IS6110
(9); however, in the NYC investigation, PGRS did not further differentiate
clusters among the cases. The matching genotypes that defined the cluster
of 13 cases might imply a transmission linkage; however, the significance
of genotype clustering among _M. bovis_ isolates is undetermined. The
ongoing investigation in NYC has determined that human-to-human
transmission was an unlikely explanation.

New York and surrounding states are accredited as TB-free for _M. bovis_ in
cattle. Cow's milk products approved for sale in New York State are
pasteurized with a few regulated exceptions. In contrast, a previous study
determined that 17 per cent of cattle sampled at meat-processing plants in
Mexico were infected with _M. bovis_ (10). An estimated 20 per cent of
cow's milk in Mexico destined for production of fresh cheese and similar
products is not pasteurized. Other pathogens potentially acquired by
consuming unpasteurized cow's milk products include _Listeria
monocytogenes_, _Salmonella spp._, _Brucella spp._, _Staphylococcus
aureus_, and _Escherichia coli_. To prevent infections with these bacteria,
consumption of unpasteurized cow's milk products should be avoided.
