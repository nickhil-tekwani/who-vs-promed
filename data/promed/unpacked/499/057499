NT (Northern Territory) Health has issued a warning about mosquito borne diseases in the Top End following a fatal case of a mosquito-borne encephalitis presentation on the Tiwi Islands.

While the specific mosquito-borne virus responsible remains unknown at this time, it is considered to most likely be Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE) virus or Kunjin virus.

MVE is a rare disease, but can be fatal. The symptoms can include severe headache, high fever, drowsiness, tremor, seizures (especially in young children), and in some cases the disease can progress to delirium, coma, permanent brain damage or death. Kunjin virus, like NVE, is rare but endemic in tropical parts of Australia, like the Top End.

People most at risk include campers, infants and young children residing near mosquito-breeding areas. People in remote Top End communities and anyone visiting parks and recreation areas where mosquitoes may be active are also at greater risk of contracting a mosquito-borne disease.

To minimise the chance of being bitten by mosquitoes, people should:
- Use a protective repellent containing 20% DEET or Picaridin;
- Wear light-coloured protective clothing (long sleeves, trousers, socks) when outdoors in mosquito prone areas;
- Avoid outdoor exposure around dusk and at night near areas of dense vegetation or areas of high mosquito activity;
- Use mosquito-proof accommodation and camping facilities at night;
- Use mosquito coils, mosquito lanterns and barrier sprays containing bifenthrin in patio and outdoor areas near houses; and
- Ensure children are adequately protected against mosquitoes.

Quotes attributable to an NT Health Spokesperson:
"There has been a case of encephalitis from Wurrumiyanga, where the patient has likely acquired the infection in early to mid-February [2021] and has sadly since passed away.

"There have been no further cases at this stage, but residents and travelers around the Top End and particularly on the Tiwi Islands should remain vigilant and take active steps to prevent mosquito bites.

"Mosquito numbers are currently relatively low, as is the risk of further infection.

"Historically, the coming weeks have proven to be a time frame of concern for transmission of mosquito- borne diseases that can cause severe disease, including encephalitis, in the NT.

"We are heading into a period with a high frequency of long-weekends, and better weather, which sees increased outdoor activities and camping trips where vigilance is essential."

A person has died in the Top End after acquiring a rare mosquito-borne virus on the Tiwi Islands.

Key points:
- Murray Valley Encephalitis and Kunjin virus can cause high fever, seizures and death
- Health authorities are warning Territorians to cover-up and use insect repellent
- The warning coincides with the annual Tiwi Islands football grand final

Health authorities say the specific virus that caused the death remains unknown, but it is believed to be either Murray Valley Encephalitis (MVE) or Kunjin virus. "There has been a case of encephalitis from Wurrumiyanga, where the patient has likely acquired the infection in early to mid-February and has sadly since passed away," an NT Health spokesperson said.

The symptoms of MVE include severe headache, high fever, drowsiness, tremor and seizures. There have been close to 40 cases of MVE notified in the NT since records began in 1974. Kunjin virus can cause similar symptoms.

Authorities are warning people to protect themselves against mosquito bites by wearing full-length clothing, applying insect repellent and avoiding outdoor exposure during dusk and night-time.

The symptoms of MVE include severe headache, high fever, drowsiness, tremor and seizures. In severe cases, people experience delirium, coma, permanent brain damage or death.

The warning comes just one day before the annual Tiwi Islands football grand final, which attracts several thousand people to the game in the community of Wurrumiyanga, 80 km (50 mi) north of Darwin.

"There have been no further cases at this stage but residents and travelers around the Top End and particularly on the Tiwi Islands should remain vigilant and take active steps to prevent mosquito bites," the spokesperson said.

"Historically, the coming weeks have proven to be a time frame of concern for transmission of mosquito-borne diseases that can cause severe disease, including encephalitis, in the NT.

"We are heading into a period with a high frequency of long-weekends, and better weather, which sees increased outdoor activities and camping trips where vigilance is essential."

The spokesperson said people most at risk included campers, infants and young children residing near mosquito-breeding areas.

[A ProMED-mail reader is thanked for calling this situation to our attention.

Cases of human infection with Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE) and Kunjin (KUN) viruses occur sporadically across Australia, including the Northern Territory. Murray Valley encephalitis virus occurs across Australia, but human cases are sporadic to rare, but can be severe. Wet weather can result in extensive breeding sites for vector mosquitoes.

Kunjin virus (KUN), a subtype of West Nile virus, was 1st isolated in Australia in 1960 from mosquitoes (_Culex annulirostris_). The virus is named for an Aboriginal clan living on the Mitchell River in Kowanyama, northern Queensland. Most cases of human infection are reported in Australia, with sporadic reports from Nepal. In Australia, Kunjin virus infection is more widely distributed than another flavivirus disease, Murray Valley encephalitis. The yearly incidence varies from 0-to-9 cases per year.

Kunjin (KUN) is reported in most of tropical Australia, eastern Queensland, and occasionally southeastern Australia. The disease appears to have been responsible for some reports of "Murray Valley encephalitis" in 1974 and was implicated in an additional sporadic case in northern Victoria in 1984. A presumptive case of KUN was reported in Pilbara, Western Australia in 1997. In 2000, the disease reappeared in Central Australia, where it had last been documented in 1974. During 1992 to 2010, 13 cases were reported in Northern Territory, and an outbreak of Kunjin virus encephalitis was reported among horses in New South Wales in 2011. The principal mosquito vectors for Kunjin virus are _Culex annulirostris_, _Cu. pseudovishnui_, and _Cu. squamosis_. _Aedes albopictus_ has been identified as a potential vector for Kunjin virus in Australia (see Kunjin virus - Australia (02): (NT) background 20190403.6403071).
