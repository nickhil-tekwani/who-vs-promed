[It may be assumed that the sheep's tissues/organs were forwarded to
the laboratory within the framework of Japan's TSE surveillance,
requiring the testing of fallen stock. No information on clinical
signs nor further details, such as the age of the animal, are
included. The case seems to be defined as 'classical scrapie,' similar
to all previous scrapie cases reported from Japan since the disease
was introduced, allegedly with imported sheep in the 1970s. The 1st
clinical case was recognised in Japan in the early 1980s; until 2002,
about 60 scrapie cases were officially reported. Since then, 3
additional cases have been reported to the OIE (one each in 2003,
2005, and the current one). All cases, so far, involved sheep.

Scrapie (sometimes termed 'classical scrapie') is considered not to
pose a risk to human health. This, in difference with the so-called
'atypical scrapie,' of which the potential risk to public health is
under study. Atypical scrapie is clinically, pathologically,
biochemically and epidemiologically unrelated to 'classical' scrapie,
may not be contagious and may, in fact, be a spontaneous degenerative
condition of older sheep. So far, no case of 'atypical' scrapie has
been diagnosed in Japan. OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code chapter
14.9, "scrapie," does not cover 'atypical scrapie;' see the
introduction to the chapter at
http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.14.9.htm.

[The differentiation between scrapie and 'atypical scrapie'
(initially discovered in Norway), is important from epidemiological,
disease control, international trade and public health considerations.
Wishing to provide our subscribers with the most up-to-date
experience, we have applied to the Norwegian Food Safety Authority
requesting a description of their current policy on both disease
entities. We are very grateful to Norway's CVO for kindly referring us
to the following updated control programme. - Mod.AS]

The Norwegian scrapie control programme small ruminants [January
2011]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. The distribution of the disease in Norway
--------------------------------------------
Currently (2010) the Norwegian sheep population is approximately 1
050 000 breeding sheep distributed on approximately 15 000 flocks
based upon the Register of production subsidies. Corresponding figures
for goat is approximately 45 000 and 1000 flocks respectively.

Scrapie has been a notifiable disease in Norway since 1965.

Scrapie was 1st diagnosed in indigenous Norwegian sheep in 1981.
Increasing numbers of scrapie-infected flocks were identified in the
1990s, culminating with 31 detected flocks in 1996. Including 2010,
scrapie had been diagnosed in a total of 148 sheep flocks. Regarding
goat, the 1st and only case of scrapie (classical) was diagnosed in
2006.

In 1998 a new scrapie strain, scrapie Nor98 (an atypical scrapie),
was detected in Norway and thereafter the scrapie cases have been
categorized as either classical scrapie or scrapie Nor98. Due to lack
of proper material, it has not been possible to classify the cases
before 1998 to scrapie strain, but the pathological findings and
genotypes affected indicates that the majority of the cases have been
classical scrapie.

Since 1998, a total of 11 sheep flocks (corresponding to 0.07 percent
of all the sheep flocks) with classical scrapie have been detected.
The classical scrapie flocks have been located in a limited
geographical area of Norway, with the majority found at the western
coast with and some additional cases in Nordland County.

During the same period scrapie Nor98 has been detected in 86 sheep
flocks (corresponding to 0.6 percent of all the sheep flocks). The
scrapie Nor98 flocks have been geographically widely spread [For maps
and figures, please refer to the original text at the above URL. -
Mod.AS]

2. The reasons for the programme
--------------------------------
Classical scrapie is a serious disease which causes considerable
economic loss to the farmers and reduced animal welfare. Norwegian
authorities have always regarded classical scrapie as one of the most
important contagious small ruminant diseases in Norway. The emerging
BSE crises in Europe during the 1990s contributed to increased public
attention towards prion diseases in general. As a consequence of the
sudden increase in classical scrapie cases in 1995 and 1996, Norway
implemented a national scrapie control programme in 1997.

The Norwegian scrapie control programme aims at eradication of the
infective agent in affected flocks and contact flocks. The scrapie
control programme consists of several elements:
a. Surveillance of the small ruminant population
b. Stamping out of infected flocks and contact flocks, washing and
disinfection, followed by an empty period of the premises for at least
2 years
c. Strict administrative provisions concerning movements of small
ruminants in Norway

A high level of education and awareness towards the disease among the
farmers and veterinarians is considered to be important for the
programme.

Since the strict control measures in positive flocks were introduced
in the 1st part of the 1990s, there have been no recurrent cases in
eradicated flocks, indicating that the applied control measures are
sufficient to eradicate classical scrapie at the premises. The low
prevalence of classical scrapie flocks detected since 1998 (0 - 2
cases each year, corresponding to an annual prevalence less than 0.05
percent) is taken as an indication that the extensive slaughtering of
scrapie flocks and their contacts (approximately 600 flocks) was
effective in reducing the prevalence of classical scrapie.

The government offers full compensation to owners who lose animals
and income because of the programme eradication measures. Thus,
considerable economic and social resources have been invested in the
programme. The results of the programme are achieved by a collective
effort among Norwegian farmers, livestock industry and animal health
authorities.

Norwegian authorities and stakeholders want to continue the strategy
laid down in the national scrapie control programme. An alternative to
the current programme is selective breeding for certain genotypes.
However, based upon the low prevalence of classical scrapie in the
country, a breeding programme is considered not to be cost effective.
As regards scrapie Nor98, the wide range of genotypes found in scrapie
Nor98 cases, implies that the breeding programme is not suitable for
controlling atypical scrapie either. Besides, several cases of
atypical scrapie have occurred in animals with the ARR/ARR genotype.

Therefore, in 2006 Norway applied for derogation from the requirement
of introducing breeding programmes to select for resistance to TSEs
[transmissible spongiform encephalopathies] which was subsequently
granted by the EFTA Surveillance Authority (2007).

3. Categories of holdings
-------------------------
The nationwide programme is mandatory and includes all small
ruminants. According to the number of years a holding has been under
surveillance, it is classified in one of the 5 different classes. [For
their details, go to the above URL].

Movements of flocks are restricted. Basically, it is forbidden to
move small ruminants between counties. The local animal health
authority may, however, grant permissions. Furthermore, it is only
permitted to take sheep and goats into a flock from a flock classified
on an equal or higher level. Currently almost all flocks in Norway are
in [highest] class 5 [under surveillance for at least 8.5 years]. If
animals of unknown surveillance status are introduced illegally into a
flock, the said flock will be degraded to the lowest class.

4. Laboratory examination procedures
------------------------------------
The national reference laboratory for TSE in Norway is the Norwegian
Veterinary Institute in Oslo. The samples are analyzed according to
the conditions laid down in Regulation (EC) Number 999/2001. [See
http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/afs/marktlab/marktlab14_en.pdf]

Clinically suspect animals are subject to histopathological
examination of brain tissue and immunohistochemical examination of
brain and lymphoid tissue for PrPSc. In addition, a rapid test (TeSeE
Bio-Rad) is performed on brain and lymphoid tissues.

>From fallen stock a pooled brain tissue sample (obex and cerebellum)
is initially examined by the rapid test. Immunohistochemistry and
Western blot (WB) are used as confirmative tests.

Western blot (TeSeE sheep/goat WB Bio-Rad) differentiates between
classical and atypical scrapie (Nor98). Immunohistochemistry is
performed using a monoclonal anti-PrP-antibody (F89/160.1.5). A
commercially available kit (Envision System HRP [AEC] DakoCytomation)
is used to enhance the sensitivity of the method.

The confirmative tests, immunohistochemistry and Western blot
analyses for PrPSc (TeSeETM sheep/goat Western Blot Bio-Rad), are
carried out at the Norwegian Veterinary Institute in Oslo.

5. Components of the programme
------------------------------
Education, notification of suspect cases, official inspections,
identification and registration of sampled flocks are essential
elements to fulfill the surveillance program.

a. Education
To ensure that the persons who are handling small ruminants have
knowledge about their obligations and the disease, information and
education campaigns have been carried out. Farmers as well as local
Veterinary Officers (VOs) have been trained.

b. Notification
There is an obligation for private practitioners to notify any
clinical suspect animal detected while carrying out private work
on-farm. The same obligation exists for the keeper, transporter or
other responsible for the animal. This obligation also applies for all
fallen stock older than 18 months.

c. Official inspections
The local VOs inspect all sheep and goat flocks in Norway regularly,
at least every 10th year. Farms with restrictions are visited every
year. The visits include both inspections of the animals and the
holding, as well as inspection of the identification marking of the
animals and the records, in particular records concerning the health
situation (including treatments) of the animals.

All clinically suspect animals are examined by the VO. Selected
animals may be re-inspected after 2 weeks, or killed and submitted to
testing. The animal may also be transferred to an isolated pen for
further observation and later examination.

Thorough inspections of the live animals to detect possible cases of
scrapie are being conducted by the farmers themselves, by the VOs on
their regular visits to the farms, and by extended ante mortem
examinations of all sheep older than 2 years. The ante mortem
examinations are usually performed in the abattoirs. In flocks with
official restrictions due to suspicion of scrapie, it has to be
performed by the VO on the farm prior to transport to the abattoir.

d. Identification and registration of animals
All holdings of small ruminants and animals belonging to them are
registered with unique identifiers in a central data base.

In addition to the above mentioned requirement the farmers are
obliged to keep holding registers and movement documents containing
information referred to in Council Regulation (EC) Number 21/2004.
[See at
http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2004:005:0008:0017:EN:PDF]

e. Sampling
Animals slaughtered for human consumption
- 10 000 sheep above 18 months of age randomly selected from the
sub-population of normally slaughtered animals
- all imported ovine and caprine animals irrespective of age
- all slaughtered ovine and caprine animals above 18 months of age
from holding subject to restriction due to the TSE control and
eradication programme

Animals not slaughtered for human consumption
- all ovine (goal 10 000) and caprine (goal 500) animals above 18
months of age which have died or have been killed for other reasons
than slaughter for human consumption
- all dead or killed for destruction ovine and caprine animals above
18 months of age from holding subject to restriction due to the TSE
control and eradication programme

Sampling following notification
- all sheep and goats showing signs of nervous disorders or
behavioural changes irrespective of age when it is not entirely clear
whether this was caused by injuries or other infections

Registration of sampled flocks
All flocks sampled will be registered at the Norwegian Veterinary
Institute. This register can be compared to the national register of
animal holdings and large flocks where no animals are tested for TSEs
might be identified for following up by the local VO.

6. Control measures
-------------------
a. Classical scrapie: Measures as a consequence of scrapie
confirmation
When classical scrapie is confirmed in a flock, the entire holding of
small ruminant animals is killed. The carcasses are treated as
category 1 material according to Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002. Any
sheep in contact flocks that were born on the affected holding, and
offspring of ewes that were born on the affected holding, are killed,
destroyed and compensation is paid by the authorities.

The prion protein genotype has since 2003 been determined for all
animals that are killed as a part of the eradication measures for
classical scrapie.

After an affected flock has been killed, extensive measures are taken
to eliminate the infectious agent from the holding. Buildings where
sheep have been kept are subjected to strict sanitation measures. If
satisfactory cleaning and disinfection is considered impossible, the
building is demolished.

The sanitation measures required for indoor areas include the removal
of manure, removal and burning of all wooden materials and other not
washable material that has been in direct contact with the sheep
(flooring, walls, drinking basins, etc), cleaning and disinfection of
remaining indoor areas, painting of least the bottom 1.5 m [4.5 feet]
of the walls of the building (including window panes), and fitting of
new floors, doors, walls etc, according to the condition on the farm.

Sanitation measures for outdoor areas include changing of the upper
layer on surrounding unpaved roads, washing, disinfection and if
necessary painting of the outside wall of relevant buildings,
ploughing and/or burning of grass on grazing areas, and disinfection
or fitting of new fences on areas that have been in contact with
sheep.

After completion of the sanitation measures, the farm must be left
empty for at least 2 years, before restrictions are lifted and new
sheep and goats are allowed to enter the farm.

Restrictions are put on pasture too. The 1st harvest after
re-cultivation (ploughing) of home fields can not be fed to sheep and
goats. If proper re-cultivation of the fields is not possible, the
land must lie fallow for 5 years. The extent of restrictions on
outlying fields may vary depending on the present circumstances, such
as grazing load and vegetation. Normally, keeping susceptible animals
away from pasturage in a 2 years time is considered sufficient.

Full compensation is paid to the owner to cover the value of the herd
and the expenses related to the sanitation measures.

b. Classical scrapie: suspect animals and contacts
Suspicion of occurrence of classical scrapie may arise due to earlier
contact between the flock and affected flocks, or the result of a
suspect animal found within a flock. Suspect animals are followed up
by the local VO.

All farms or flocks that have either sold sheep to an
scrapie-affected flock, or bought sheep from an scrapie-affected
flocks or kept sheep from scrapie-affected flocks temporarily on their
farms within the last 10 years prior to the diagnosis, are put under
official restrictions for at least 5 years. The restrictions include a
ban on transfer of live sheep to any other farm, to exhibitions and to
introduce animals into the farm.

In farms that have had ewes from affected flocks in their buildings
in the lambing period, the restriction includes a ban on taking the
flock to pastures that are shared with other flocks. If these farms
agree to kill or slaughter all
