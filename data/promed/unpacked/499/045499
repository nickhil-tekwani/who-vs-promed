A Standardbred horse at The Meadows Racetrack [& Casino], in Washington, Pennsylvania, that began showing clinical signs consistent with equine herpes myeloencephalopathy has tested positive for equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1), the Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported [24 Jan 2018]. The horse is being treated by a veterinarian.

The EDCC said, "2 barns at The Meadows are currently under quarantine due to a horse that moved earlier from the original exposed barn. This horse causing the 2nd barn's movement restriction is not showing clinical signs. A daily monitoring period for clinical signs in the remaining exposed, asymptomatic horses is ongoing."

TheHorse.com will provide additional information as it becomes available.

Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and myeloencephalopathy (the neurologic form). In many horses, fever is the only sign of EHV-1 infection, which can go undetected.

In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months), but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with the neurologic form usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore- and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

Horse racing at The Meadows Racetrack & Casino has been suspended through 6 Feb 2018, after 3 more horses were diagnosed with a contagious virus, according to the state Department of Agriculture.

Officials said in a news release, 5 barns of 190 horses at the Washington county facility now are under quarantine by state veterinarians after an initial outbreak was reported [Wed 24 Jan 2018]. An initial quarantine then was limited to 2 barns of 60 horses after one horse was diagnosed with equine herpes virus, or EHV-1, a mild respiratory illness. That horse is responding well to treatment, according to the release.

Racing options will be re-evaluated next week [week of 5 Feb 2018], officials said. Horses are not permitted to come into or leave the racetrack. 3 horses in the quarantined barns that had elevated temperatures are being monitored.

Signs include fever, nasal discharge, lethargy, and neurological issues, according to a fact sheet from the Equine Disease Communication Center.

The virus can be spread through the air, via humans or on contaminated surfaces, the fact sheet states. It does not pose a threat to people or non-equine animals.

Unless a new case is detected, all horses can be cleared after 28 days without signs or 21 days with confirmation of negative test results for the virus.

The Oregon Department of Agriculture is reporting a case of wild type EHV-1 has been detected at the Portland Meadows racetrack [in Portland, Multnomah county]. A 7-year-old Thoroughbred mare developed mild ataxia on 25 Jan 2018.

Neither the neuropathogenic nor wild type strains of EHV-1 were detected by PCR testing on blood EDTA [anticoagulant] samples. The EHV-1 neuropathogenic strain was not detected by PCR testing on nasal swab samples, however, the wild type strain was detected.

Portland Meadows racetrack veterinary authorities have quarantined the index case and high-risk contacts in a barn separate from other horses. Enhanced biosecurity measures have been implemented.

The index case is stable and non-febrile. High-risk contacts are being closely monitored. To date, there have been no additional sick animals reported.

Equine herpesvirus is very contagious. Often the 1st and only clinical sign is a fever. Owners in these areas should carefully observe their animals several times daily. Aggressive treatment is needed realizing it may be unsuccessful and the horse may have to be euthanized for humane reasons.

This seems to be a very busy year for EHV. - Mod.TG]
