There have been 7,600 cases of dengue reported so far this year, Puerto
Rico Health Secretary Carmen Feliciano told a local newspaper last week,
compared with 2,500 cases to date last year. A 1994 dengue epidemic in
Puerto Rico resulted in 25,000 illnesses and 9,000 hospitalizations. The
effects will be far worse if the virus continues to spread at the current
rate, Gary Clark, director of the Dengue Program at the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control in San Juan, said in an interview.
But Clark said that tourists planning to visit Puerto Rico should not be
dissuaded by the dengue problem. If visitors stick to beaches, rain forest
and other resort areas, their risk of infection is near zero, he said. "I
would tell anyone considering a visit to come ahead." The one precaution
visitors should take: Use insect repellent if mosquitoes are swarming, he
added.
Puerto Rican health authorities have launched a campaign to limit the
spread of dengue. Locals are urged to prevent accumulation of standing
water, where mosquitoes can breed. Locals and visitors can avoid the risk
of infection by staying in air-conditioned buildings or hotels; avoiding
highly populated residential areas; and concentrating their visits on the
beach or in forested areas, according to a brochure the CDC is circulating
in Puerto Rico.
