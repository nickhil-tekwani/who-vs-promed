[Bluetongue (BT) is a non-contagious, viral disease affecting domestic and wild ruminants (primarily sheep and including cattle, goats, buffalo, antelope, deer, elk, and camels) that is transmitted by insects, particularly biting midges of the _Culicoides_ species. The virus which causes BT is identified as a member of the _Reoviridae_ family (http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Media_Center/docs/pdf/Disease_cards/BLUET-EN.pdf).

According to the OIE Terrestrial Manual, Chapter 2.1.3. on Bluetongue and Epizootic Haemorrhagic disease (version adopted May 2009), BTV is a member of the _Orbivirus_ genus of the family _Reoviridae_, one of 20 recognised species or serogroups in the genus. The BTV species, or serogroup, contains 24 recognised serotypes (http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.03_BLUETONGUE.pdf).

Recently a Toggenburg orbivirus (TOV) was detected in healthy goats in Switzerland. The virus is related closely to bluetongue virus (BTV) and is considered tentatively as a 25th serotype of BTV (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20219538).

The number of BTV serotypes can be found at http://www.reoviridae.org/dsrna_virus_proteins/reoid/btv-25.htm#BTV-25.

This disease does not affect humans, nor is there any risk of the disease being contracted or spread through meat or milk. However, it can cause considerable damage to livestock populations. It is a trans-boundary disease and the epidemiological situation in one country can affect neighbouring ones, while national measures tend not to be sufficient to control its spread (http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/topics/topic/bluetongue.htm).

The bluetongue situation in the EU has considerably changed in recent times with incursions of new serotypes, namely of serotype 8 (in an area of the Community where outbreaks have never been reported before and which was not considered at risk of bluetongue). Bluetongue serotypes 1, 2, 4, 9, and 16 have caused outbreaks mainly in sheep flocks in the Balearic Islands (Spain), Sardinia, Sicily, Corsica and other parts of Italy, Spain, France, and Portugal (http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/bluetongue_qa_en.htm).

Information obtained from OIE's WAHID database indicates that during 2012 Italian authorities reported 325 outbreaks of BT. The outbreaks were located in the regions of: Abruzzo BTV-16 (1), Calabria BTV-2,9 (1), Campania BTV-2,9 (2), Sardinia BTV-1,2,4 (316), and Sicily BTV- 2,9 (5).

BTV-1 was also reported from Portugal (3) and Spain (4).

This information and additional data on these outbreaks can be found in the WAHID database at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statusdetail (Note: to view the information on bluetongue, scroll down to the name of the disease, choose the region or country and time period).

According to the information above, BTV-1 had been reported only in Sardinia. With this latest outbreak, it is now reported to have occurred in the mainland of the country. The most recently EU BT map shows BTV-1 not present on Italy's mainland; in fact, the BTV-1 situation in Sardinia/mainland Italy is comparable to that of Corsica/mainland France (http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/bt_restrictedzones-map_2012.jpg).

Vaccination against bluetongue is an important tool for the control of the disease and is also used to permit 'safe' trade in live ruminants based on EU legislation and in accordance with World organisation for animal health (OIE) standards (http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/topics/topic/bluetongue.htm).

Although this latest immediate notification from Italy indicates that "vaccination" is not one of the control measures used, vaccination has been a tool used in other outbreaks. Vaccination was used as a control measure during 2012 where a total of 48 176 cattle and 56 810 sheep and goats were vaccinated in Sardinia (see http://www.salute.gov.it/portale/veterinariaInternazionale/documenti/bollettinoAprile2013/bluetongueitaliascfcah.pdf). - Mods.CRD/AS
