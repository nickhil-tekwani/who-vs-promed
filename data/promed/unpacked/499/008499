Disease Scare: Cattle Quarantined In Yei County
----------------------------------------------
The incident was triggered by the death of one person and hospitalisation of 3 others whom were suspected to have fed on infected beef.

The Mundari Chief will take custody of the cattle until court hearing commences. A meeting was convened at the County Commissioner's office [to include] the family of the deceased and the cattle's owner. A relative of the victim blamed the County Legal Advisor and the police for not taking swift action to address the situation.

Cattle and meat sellers present at the meeting called for the re-opening of butcheries that were recently closed, saying not all of them were involved in cattle thefts.

Meanwhile, the Yei River County Commissioner Juma David has directed that all cattle and meat sellers must possess licenses and necessary health documents before the butcheries are re-opened. He announced that the county authorities will establish a cattle camp outside Yei town where cattle bought for sale can be kept. The Commissioner also said that a slaughterhouse will be constructed in the area and added that all cattle must be examined by the veterinary office before slaughter.

[Frankly we are guessing at the cause of death of the one person and for the hospitalisation of the 3 others. When one has civil problems, such as are described here, the sale of meat from sick or moribund animals increases in likelihood.
