Eurosurveillance Editorial: Pandemic H1N1
influenza lessons from the southern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early in the Influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009
outbreak, an editorial in Eurosurveillance noted
the importance of observing experience with this
novel virus in the southern hemisphere during
their usual winter influenza season [1]. This
special issue of Eurosurveillance is a timely
response to that call. It contains reports from
the island of Reunion, South Africa, South
America (Brazil, Peru), and Australia (New South
Wales and Victoria). It also includes an overview
of the effect of the pandemic on indigenous
people. This editorial summarises some of the key
findings from these papers, reviews features of
pandemic H1N1 influenza epidemiology in these
countries, and lists some potential lessons for
the northern hemisphere (and possible future
waves in the southern hemisphere). Important
findings from the papers in Eurosurveillance
volume 14, issue 43 [For details see final comment. - Mod.CP]

Investigators from Reunion Island (located near
Madagascar in the Indian Ocean) [2] used data
from multiple surveillance systems, including
influenza-like illness (ILI) reports by sentinel
practitioners, virological surveillance,
surveillance of hospital emergency departments
and intensive care units (ICUs), and fatal cases
attributed to influenza A(H1N1)v infection. The
introduction of the pandemic virus happened later
than in other southern hemisphere countries with
community transmission not documented until 23
Jul 2009. The pandemic virus became the
predominant circulating influenza virus on
Reunion within 4 weeks following its 1st detection.

The paper from South Africa provides one of the
1st reports on the pandemic from an African
country [3]. It is based on a descriptive
analysis of the national epidemiology of the
influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009 outbreak,
focussing on laboratory-confirmed cases and
deaths. Surveillance included multiple systems
and an expected shift in focus as the pandemic
progressed. The final analysis was based on a
large number of laboratory-confirmed cases (12
331) including 91 deaths. Of particular note was
the high proportion of fatal cases who were human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive (53 percent
based on 17/32 tested, against a background HIV
prevalence of 18 percent in 15-49 year-old
adults) and pregnant (56 percent, based on 25/45 women of reproductive age).

Assessment of the pandemic in Brazil [4] was
based on surveillance of notified influenza cases
and later ILI cases with severe acute respiratory
infection (SARI). Reflecting its large
population, Brazil reported 34 506 cases of ILI
with SARI, although only 16.7 percent were
laboratory-confirmed as pandemic influenza. There
were 1567 recorded deaths among SARI cases,
including 645 with confirmed pandemic influenza.
The age distribution of cases (peaks in the under
5-year-olds and in adults 20-29 years, with lower
rates in the over 60-year-olds) was similar to
that seen in higher income countries such as
Australia and New Zealand. Severe illness was
associated with pregnancy and a range of
co-morbidities (notably chronic lower respiratory
and metabolic diseases). The authors also noted
marked geographic variations with cases
concentrated in southern and south-eastern
Brazil, regions with more temperate climates
bordering other affected South American countries.

Description of the pandemic in Peru [5] was based
on established sentinel ILI and virological
surveillance of influenza, surveillance of SARI,
acute respiratory infection (ARI) and pneumonia,
and additional case and cluster investigation.
Peru reported 8381 confirmed cases including 143
fatalities. Most fatal cases (75.5 percent) had
an identified co-morbidity, notably metabolic,
cardiovascular or respiratory disease.

This edition includes 3 separate reports from
Australia. Investigators from New South Wales
(NSW) [6] provide perhaps the most comprehensive
description of the pandemic using multiple
surveillance systems (including use of novel
systems such as ambulance despatch data and
Web-based systems for capturing attendances at
specialist influenza clinics and ICU
utilisation). The pandemic there lasted 10 weeks
and had a substantial impact on ICUs, with an
increased risk of severe illness, including
respiratory failure, in those aged between 35 and
60 years. As seen elsewhere, vulnerable groups
included pregnant women, indigenous people
(Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islanders), those
with chronic respiratory disease, and those with
morbid obesity. However, the general
influenza-related mortality and overall mortality
between April and September 2009 was lower than
that seen during the same period in recent years.

Although commencing earlier, the pandemic in
Victoria [7] followed a similar epidemic pattern
to NSW, based on a general practitioner sentinel
surveillance system and notifications of
laboratory-confirmed influenza. Peak ILI rates
were comparable in magnitude to several previous
years. Understanding of the Victorian experience
has been strengthened by an accompanying paper
which estimates the reproduction number (R)
during the epidemic in that state [8]. After
accounting for undetected transmission, the
authors estimate R at 1.6 (95 percent credible interval: 1.5-1.8).

The final paper is focussed on the impact of the
pandemic on indigenous people, rather than on a
specific geographic area [9]. From the southern
hemisphere, this analysis included indigenous
people in Brazil (Amerindians), Australia
(Aborigines and Torres Straits Islanders), New
Zealand (Maori and Pacific peoples), and the
Pacific (Polynesians, Melanesians). It also
included indigenous people in the northern
hemisphere, notably in Canada and the United
States. In all of these countries indigenous
peoples experienced significantly elevated risks
of serious infection, with hospitalisation and
mortality rates that were 3 to 7 times higher
than those reported for non-indigenous populations.

The time course and impact of the pandemic in southern hemisphere countries
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The countries described in this issue of
Eurosurveillance are located south of the equator
and share the same winter season. Consequently
the emergence of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza
coincided with their peak period for seasonal
influenza. Despite considerable geographical and
demographical differences between them, the
pandemic showed a surprisingly consistent pattern
of infection across these countries. We have
summarised some epidemiologic features of the
H1N1 influenza pandemic in these countries. For
purposes of comparison, we have included data on
several other large South American countries
(Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay,) and some
of the larger Pacific Islands (New Caledonia,
French Polynesia, Samoa, Fiji) for which data
were readily available in the public domain.
[These data are presented in the form of a table
(too complex to reproduce here) of the key
epidemiological features of the H1N1 influenza
pandemic reported by selected southern hemisphere
countries. Readers should access the original
text via the source URL for this article].

Following its detection in Mexico in mid-March
2009, the epidemic spread rapidly to all southern
hemisphere countries listed in the Table [10]. In
these countries, the 1st reported identifications
of introduced virus ranged from late April
through to early July. Introduction of the virus
was followed by a variable interval before local
community transmission was confirmed (i.e.,
transmission from cases with no known history of
overseas travel or contact with a person or group
with a connection to an imported case). Community
transmission was usually accompanied by a rapidly
accelerating epidemic that peaked within 2 to 6
weeks. The pandemic virus swiftly replaced
seasonal influenza viruses [11]. The epidemic
decline, although rapid, was usually somewhat slower than the initial rise.

Rates of hospitalisations and deaths showed wide
variability by country. Hospitalisation rates
ranged from 2.0 to 31.8 per 100 000 population,
and mortality rates ranged from 0 to 36.1 per million population.

Consistent features of the pandemic in southern hemisphere countries
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Within larger countries there were often marked
regional variations in influenza rates. Some
regions lagged by a few days to a few weeks. At
the end of the spread within the country, there
were often large geographic variations in the
reported incidence of infection and its outcomes
(hospitalisation and mortality rates).

There were consistent patterns in those most
likely to present with clinical illness, and
particularly, those most likely to have poor
outcomes of infection such as hospitalisation,
ICU treatment, or death. Illness rates tended to
be highest in children under the age of five
years, sometimes with a 2nd peak in young adults,
with uniformly low rates in older populations (60
and over years). The downward shift in age was
well illustrated in South Africa where the median
age of pandemic H1N1 influenza cases was 16
years, compared with 27 years for seasonal influenza A(H1N1) in 2008.

Indigenous people were vulnerable to poor outcome
from pandemic H1N1 influenza infection [9]. Other
vulnerable groups were pregnant women (with ICU
admission rates in Australasia about 9 times
higher than expected [12]), severely obese people
(with ICU admission rates in Australasia for
those with a body mass index (BMI) of >35 about 5
times higher than expected [12]), and those with
asthma or other chronic respiratory disease (with
ICU admission rates in Australasia more than
twice as high as would be expected [12]). HIV
infection appeared more common in fatal cases in
South Africa than expected based on prevalence in the population [3].

Mortality from the pandemic appeared to be
relatively low. Most countries reported mortality
rates of less than one per 100 000 population.
There is evidence from New South Wales that
excess mortality from influenza and pneumonia
over the period of the pandemic was less than in
previous years [6]. These results suggest the
case fatality ratio (CFR) was also low. The main
limitation in estimating the CFR is uncertainty
over the size of the infected denominator
population [13]. A report from New Zealand
estimated approximately 7.5 percent of the
population had symptomatic illness, suggesting
10-15 percent may have been infected and a CFR of
<0.01 percent [14]. Samoa provides a dramatic
illustration of the impact of this pandemic
compared to the 1918-19 pandemic. At that time
the islands (then named "Western Samoa") had the
highest death rate for any country or territory,
losing 19-22 percent of its population [15]. In
the current pandemic Samoa has recorded only 2
deaths, a mortality rate of 0.001 percent.

The pandemic appears not to have overwhelmed
health services in the southern hemisphere
countries reviewed in this issue, although some
services were at their maximum capacity. In
Australia and New Zealand, ICU admissions due to
confirmed infection with pandemic influenza were
carefully tracked and reached a maximum of 8.9 to
19.0 percent of ICU capacity during the most
intense weeks of the pandemic [12]. However, a
report from Argentina suggested that the pandemic
can threaten to overwhelm health care systems
unless the public is given very clear messages
about the appropriate use of these services [16].

Pandemic containment measures were inconsistently
used in southern hemisphere countries and their
impact remains uncertain. Border and cluster
controls were reported by Australia (NSW [6] and
Victoria [7]), New Zealand [14], Reunion Island
[2] and Peru [5]). Both New Zealand and Reunion
reported delays of several weeks from the 1st
detection of imported cases to the establishment
of community transmission. By contrast,
investigators in Victoria suggested that
community transmission of the pandemic virus may
have been established prior to the commencement of testing [7].

Southern hemisphere countries used data from a
range of surveillance systems. The most
comprehensive appeared able to provide timely and
sensitive information on general practice
consultations, emergency department attendances,
hospitalisations, ICU utilisation, and deaths
from influenza and related diseases. Countries
with fewer resources had correspondingly fewer
sources of information. Surveillance in these
settings tended to be orientated toward meeting
the more minimal surveillance requirements of the
World Health Organization (WHO) [17], which focus
on early detection and investigation,
comprehensive assessment, and monitoring of the pandemic.

Areas of uncertainty and research needs
---------------------------------------
The infectiousness of the pandemic virus (as
measured by the reproduction number) and existing
immunity in the population have not been fully
characterised. The analysis from Victoria
presented here [8], may help to explain one of
the paradoxical findings of the pandemic in
southern hemisphere countries: the observation of
a rapid rise in the epidemic curve would suggest
a fairly infectious virus, whereas the proportion
of the population apparently infected appears
relatively small [14]. The estimated reproduction
numbers of 1.6 for Victoria was within the range
of 1.37 reported for Peru [18] to 1.96 for New
Zealand [19]. As the analysis for Victoria
suggests, a single estimate of R is inadequate to
fully characterise the infectiousness of the
virus. Their finding of higher infectiousness in
children suggests an epidemic that was rapidly
propagated in children, with some "spillover"
into adult populations. Combined with some
pre-existing immunity in older age groups, this
modelling would help to explain the observed
epidemic pattern. Serological surveys will be
useful to clarify these issues further.

It is too early to expect robust evaluations of
the interventions used in southern hemisphere
countries during the pandemic. The apparent
success of border controls and cluster controls
at delaying pandemic entry into some countries,
such as New Zealand and Reunion, should be
evaluated. The declining reproduction number
observed in Victoria may reflect the effect of
mitigation strategies such as reactive school
closure, quarantine, antiviral treatment and
prophylaxis and voluntary social distancing or
may merely be a feature of the pandemic virus
infecting an immunologically naive population.
Again, the effects of pharmaceutical treatment
and social distancing measures need further
evaluation. As has happened in Australia, we
believe it is appropriate for national funding
agencies to support both commissioned and
investigator-led research, so that we can learn
as much as possible from this pandemic [20].

There are lessons that European countries can
potentially learn from the experience in the
southern hemisphere with this pandemic [These
lessons are separately tabulated and interested
readers should access this table in the original
text via the URL at the head of this report].
High quality surveillance and research in the
northern hemisphere also has the capacity to
reduce the considerable uncertainty that remains
around the behaviour of this new pandemic virus.
