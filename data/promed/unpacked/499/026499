Since endocrine disrupting compounds are a relatively new topic in emerging
contaminants in the environment, I am submitting the following list of
resources for distribution [these references have been posted previously
and can be found in Breeding disturbance, pelicans (USA) (ND)
(02) 20040708.1825 as listed below. - Mod.MPP]. These contain excellent
references for the investigation of wildlife and of the effects of EDCs on
their populations. These references contain primary citations that may
explain the sex change population shift in UK fish. Noted in the following
references are many well-documented cases of this endocrine disrupting
effect in fish from various locations globally.
It has been well documented that estrogens and their metabolites (i.e.
pharmaceuticals) cause sex ratio shifts in fish, as do estrogen mimics from
many sources, such as personal care products, some pesticides, and some
surfactants. These chemicals, and/or their metabolites, can originate from
municipal wastewater treatment and many non-point sources and runoff from
the land and groundwater.
