It's called black band coral disease and it was first found in Kauai waters in 2006.

Two summers ago marine photographer Terry Lilley began documenting the die-off triggering a rapid response team of experts from the University of Hawaii, National Marine Fisheries and US Geological survey to spring into action.

Scientists pinpointed the cyanobacteria -- the blue-green algae -- that has been attacking montipora rice corals.

They do know it is spreading, although so far the outbreak is just on Kauai -- most recently documented at Ke'e and Makua beach. "We really hope we can control it before it spreads elsewhere," said Frazer McGilvray, aquatics administrator of the Department of Land and Natural Resources [DLNR].

Now, the various agencies are preparing to launch a campaign to keep the coral problem a top priority. It's putting out the call for ocean users to be on the lookout for the disease across the state.

"We do know of coral diseases that have wiped out 80 percent of the coral in the Caribbean. So, this is potentially a very, very damaging disease so we need to get a handle on it here," said McGilvray.

Aquatic Resource staff have launched a new webpage [Reef Response] they hope will be a go-to site for information, including links to the "Eyes of the Reef" -- a non-profit group tasked with reporting marine problems.

"The Eyes of the Reef website is where you go to file your observations and send in your photos. The Reef Response webpage on the DLNR site is where all the information that is coming out of the multi agency team [will be posted]. It's a one-stop shop for information," said DLNR marine resource specialist Anne Rosinksi.

Summer is just around corner and scientists fully expect more of these hotspots to crop up but they hope this approach and this website will help keep the public on guard.

The state's new aquatic resources boss admits his program is massively understaffed and underfunded to deal with the problem on its own.

"In an ideal world we would have been on this 10 years ago but the best thing we can say is, we are on it now and moving forward we know we have to do this," said McGilvray.

From Kramarsky-Winter et al 2014 (Microbial Ecology): "Black band disease (BBD), characterized by a black mat or line that migrates across a coral colony leaving behind it a bare skeleton, is a persistent disease affecting massive corals worldwide. Previous microscopic and molecular examination of this disease in faviid corals from the Gulf of Eilat revealed a number of possible pathogens with the most prominent being a cyanobacterium identified as _Pseudoscillatoria coralii_. We examined diseased coral colonies using histopathological and molecular methods in order to further assess the possible role of this cyanobacterium, its mode of entry, and pathological effects on the coral host tissues. Affected areas of colonies with BBD were sampled for examination using both light and transmission electron microscopies. Results showed that this dominant cyanobacterium was found on the coral surface, at the coral-skeletal interface, and invading the polyp tissues and gastrovascular cavity. Although tissues surrounding the invasive cyanobacterial filaments did not show gross morphological alterations, microscopic examination revealed that the coral cells surrounding the lesion were dissociated, necrotic, and highly vacuolated. No amoebocytes were evident in the mesoglea of affected tissues suggesting a possible repression of the coral immune response. Morphological and molecular similarity of the previously isolated BBD-associated cyanobacterium _P. coralii_ to the current samples strengthens the premise that this species is involved in the disease in this coral. These results indicate that the cyanobacteria may play a pivotal role in this disease and that the mode of entry may be via ingestion, penetrating the coral via the gastrodermis, as well as through the skeletal-tissue interface."

Coral diseases may have multiple interacting causes. Coral reefs worldwide are threatened by increasing anthropogenic stressors, particularly overfishing and the problems associated with global climate change. Coral disease is recognized as another problem causing the degradation of reefs, which is demonstrated by a global increase in the numbers of coral diseases, coral species affected, and disease outbreaks.
