[1] Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, Brazil

A Brazilian medical study reveals a link between the mosquito-borne virus Zika and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), a condition often misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis (MS).

The study, the findings of which were released on Friday [29 Apr 2016], was carried out by a hospital in Recife, capital of the northeastern Pernambuco state worst affected by the Zika epidemic.

Brazilian news network Globo reported on Friday [29 Apr 2016] that doctors at the hospital's department of neurology tested samples taken from 180 patients infected with the Zika virus showing neurological symptoms and found 30 of them had developed ADEM, encephalitis or myelitis.

Another 60 patients came down with Guillain-Barre syndrome, a disorder previously associated with Zika that causes the immune system to attack the nervous system, leading to muscle weakness and paralysis.

Brito said that ADEM is a more complicated condition in which "the patient's level of consciousness can change. In other words, they can enter into a coma."

Of those with ADEM, 2 continue to suffer with symptoms almost a year after the onset of the disease, including "a boy with motor deficit and an adult with motor difficulty and impaired vision," Brito said.

The National Multiple Sclerosis Society describes ADEM as "a brief but intense attack of inflammation (swelling) in the brain and spinal cord and occasionally the optic nerves that damages the brain's myelin (the white coating of nerve fibers)."

Unlike MS, which is gradual, ADEM appears rapidly and is passing, though it can leave permanent damage. Common symptoms include rapid onset fever, weakness and loss of vision, and in extreme cases, coma.

[These are additional cases of ADEM with a long-term study. Zika infections grow ever more complex. This report will be of interest to clinicians in the other countries, especially Colombia, undergoing a Zika virus outbreak. - Mod.TY]

Author Summary
Zika virus is currently spreading rapidly through the Americas, including the Caribbean, where it has emerged as a major public health problem due to the linkage with birth defects, including microcephaly. We report the isolation of Zika virus from 3 children in rural Haiti in December, 2014, as part of a study of acute undifferentiated febrile illness that was being conducted by our research group; from one of these children, we also isolated dengue virus serotype 1. On analysis of nucleotide sequence data from these and Zika strains from other locales, the South American/Haitian sequences cluster within the Asian clade and clearly branch out from a sequence circulating in Easter Island, which originated, in turn, from French Polynesia. On further analysis of one specific gene sequence for which more data were available, there appeared to be slight separation of Haitian strains and the strains from Brazil, Suriname, Puerto Rico and Guatemala, with molecular clock analysis suggesting that Zika virus was present in Haiti as early as mid-2013. These findings raise questions about the origin of Zika virus in the Caribbean, and subsequent patterns of circulation of the virus within the Americas.

Victor A. Kostyuchenko, Elisa X. Y. Lim, Shuijun Zhang, Guntur Fibriansah, Thiam-Seng Ng, Justin S. G. Ooi, Jian Shi & Shee-Mei Lok. Structure of the thermally stable Zika virus.

Zika virus (ZIKV), formerly a neglected pathogen, has recently been associated with microcephaly in fetuses, and with Guillian-Barre syndrome in adults. Here we present the resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of ZIKV, and show that the overall architecture of the virus is similar to that of other flaviviruses. Sequence and structural comparisons of the ZIKV envelope (E) protein with other flaviviruses show that parts of the E protein closely resemble the neurovirulent West Nile and Japanese encephalitis viruses, while others are similar to dengue virus (DENV). However, the contribution of the E protein to flavivirus pathobiology is currently not understood. The virus particle was observed to be structurally stable even when incubated at 40 C, in sharp contrast to the less thermally stable DENV. This is also reflected in the infectivity of ZIKV compared to DENV serotypes 2 and 4 (DENV2 and DENV4) at different temperatures. The cryo-electron microscopy structure shows a virus with a more compact surface. This structural stability of the virus may help it to survive in the harsh conditions of semen, saliva and urine. Antibodies or drugs that destabilize the structure may help to reduce the disease outcome or limit the spread of the virus.

Zika virus detection in _Aedes albopictus_ in Mexico

On 20 Apr 2016, the Mexico International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point (NFP) reported that on 28 Mar 2016, the Arbovirus and Hemorrhagic virus Laboratory of the Institute of Epidemiological Diagnosis and Reference (InDRE) received _Aedes albopictus_ mosquitoes for testing from the San Luis Potosi State Public Health Laboratory as part of the entomolo-virologic surveillance. The mosquitoes were tested by real time RT-PCR to detect Zika virus.

On 1 Apr [2016], the InDRE confirmed the detection of Zika virus in the mosquitoes. This is the 1st evidence of the presence of Zika virus in _Aedes albopictus_ captured in the environment in Mexico and in the Americas. This finding demonstrates the quality of work conducted by the Mexico Epidemiological Surveillance System (SINAVE).

[_Aedes aegypti_ has been recognized as the principal mosquito vector of Zika virus in the Americas. However, there has been concern about the possible role of _Ae. albopictus_ in transmission of the virus. This is the 1st reported presence of the virus in field collections of this mosquito. Presence of the virus does not prove that it can transmit the virus. However, this observation deserves laboratory studies to determine the vector efficiency of this mosquito for local isolates of Zika virus and intensification of surveillance of the mosquito in the field to determine the presence of the virus in this mosquito in areas of active transmission to humans. If _Aedes albopictus_ is shown to be an efficient vector of Zika virus, it would expand the geographic area of concern in the USA, because it occurs over a greater area than that of _Ae. aegypti_.

There is a recently published worldwide overview of _Aedes albopictus_- associated risks and geographic distribution available at http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/healthtopics/vectors/mosquitoes/Pages/aedes-albopictus.aspx. - Mod.TY
