Specter of epidemic as sea lion pups die
----------------------------------------
A mystery flesh-eating disease is again killing sea lion pups in the
sub-Antarctic, and scientists say it could be linked to an epidemic that
wiped out half the pups born in 1998. An unusual bacterial infection was
found in healthy pups this breeding season at the Auckland Islands' 2 main
breeding grounds of Enderby and Dundas Islands.
The pups developed swelling of the limb joints, became lame, and died. The
pups were found to have a septic infection of the joints and a disease of
the muscles and bone similar to the flesh-eating bacterial disease that
affects humans. "The indications are it is very similar to the one involved
in the 1998 epidemic," said Department of Conservation (DoC) spokesman
Jeremy Carroll.
So far 8 dead pups have been sent to Massey University for analysis to
determine if they have the same campylobacter bacteria found in dead pups
after the 1998 outbreak. This season's deaths were a double blow to the
animals because birth rates at the sub-Antarctic breeding grounds were
already down by almost a third, said DoC research team leader Dr Ian Wilkinson.
Pup deaths in early January on the largest colony on Dundas Island were two
thirds higher than normal, he said. In January, pups were dying at the rate
of 4 a day and by the time scientists left Enderby Island in late February,
133 of 403 pups had died.
Low female reproduction and high mortality rates through diseases such as
hookworm are expected in sea lion populations, but scientists need to know
whether the deaths from the bacterial disease are natural. "It's important
we find out how often they occur and their effect on sea lion populations
so we can manage human impacts such as accidental drowning by fishing
trawlers," Mr Carroll said.
DoC lists New Zealand's sub-Antarctic sea lions as endangered, and they are
protected. Their numbers are estimated to be between 10 000 and 16 000 but
just 3000 are breeding females.
