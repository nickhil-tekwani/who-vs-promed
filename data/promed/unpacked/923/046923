Human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus - China
---------------------------------
On 11 Nov 2015, the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) of China notified WHO of 2 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus.

Details of the cases
------
The 1st case is a 62-year-old female from Shengzhou City, Zhejiang Province who developed symptoms on 1 Oct 2015. She visited a poultry market and raised poultry at home. The 2nd case is a 51-year-old female from Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province who developed symptoms on 3 Oct 2015. She raised poultry at home.

Public health response
--------------
The Chinese Government has taken the following surveillance and control measures: strengthen outbreak surveillance and situation analysis; reinforce all efforts on medical treatment; and conduct risk communication with the public and dissemination of information.

WHO is assessing the epidemiological situation and conducting further risk assessments based on the latest information. Overall, the public health risk from avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses has not changed.

If the pattern of human cases follows the trends seen in previous years, the human case number may rise over the coming months. Further sporadic cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus are expected in affected and possibly in the neighboring areas. Should human cases from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travels or after arrival. If this were to occur, community level spread is considered unlikely as the virus has not demonstrated the ability to transmit easily among humans.

WHO advice
-------
WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms, or contact with animals in live bird markets, or entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.

WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns in order to ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005) and continue national health preparedness actions.

[2] 4th wave H7N9

Raising the alarm for poultry-related livelihoods and public health, FAO warned countries today [15 Oct 2015] that a 4th wave of avian influenza H7N9 has already begun.

The novel A(H7N9) avian influenza virus originally emerged in humans in China in early 2013. Each winter since then, southern China has witnessed an upsurge in human infections.

H7N9 spreads silently in poultry, since it causes little to no illness in birds. It can infect people through direct contact with infected birds or their secretions. Surveillance in China has shown that H7N9 has become well established in poultry populations in southeastern parts of the country, and the virus can cause mild to severe disease in humans, and in some cases even death. According to official numbers released by Chinese authorities, H7N9 has caused mortality in roughly 40 percent of reported human infections. Out of the 678 human cases reported to date, 271 have died.

FAO marked the beginning of wave 4 on 2 Oct [2015] after Chinese authorities in Zhejiang Province reported the 1st 2 human cases since July 2015. According to Dr Eran Raizman, head of FAO's Emergency Prevention System, these are indicators of things to come.

"We expect human cases to rise sharply in the coming weeks or months, as has happened in previous years. This is due in part to the seasonal behaviour of the virus, helped along by critical gaps in biosecurity commonly found in the poultry industry."

As shown by over a decade of studies by FAO and partners, a lack of good biosecurity has exacerbated the situation in southeast Asia when it comes to avian influenza viruses. Mixing of species, lack of flock identification and movement control, close contact between birds at live bird markets and many other factors enable viruses to circulate among poultry and sometimes spread to humans. China's neighbours continue to be highly at risk due to their close geographic vicinity and poultry trade links.

Moreover, H7N9 is a major livelihood concern. In order to protect the public, poultry with H7N9 infection must be destroyed. These harsh but necessary control efforts can place great strains on the vulnerable people who depend on poultry. Families often lose their entire businesses and means of subsistence, and many governments may not have sufficient emergency funds to compensate those affected.

"H7N9 is still a serious problem, and it is not going away any time soon," added Dr Raizman. "Countries need to push now more than ever for better and safer production approaches in the poultry sector, from farming to transport and marketing. Integrating good biosecurity practices into the way the poultry sector does business is the only way countries can effectively reduce the risks posed by H7N9 and other avian influenza viruses."

FAO is calling on countries to intensify biosecurity along the poultry value chain. To assist in this regard, FAO has just published 2 new additions to its series of guidelines for addressing H7N9:
1. biosecurity improvement in live bird markets; and
2. risk communication messaging

FAO has been monitoring H7N9 since its emergence and produces biweekly updates available at http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/empres/H7N9/situation_update.html.
