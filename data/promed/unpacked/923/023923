Several people have responded to the posting about Texas' investigation of
Yersinia in infants with suggestions/observations about the link between
chitterlings (chitlins) and Yersinia enterocolitica outbreaks in Georgia,
New York, etc. We are aware of this established link and have included
questions about chitterlings on our questionnaire.
The group of infants we are studying right now includes 2 Hispanic infants,
8 white non-Hispanic infants, and one black infant. They range in age from
3 weeks to 12 months old (the previously mentioned 18 month old cultured a
different pathogenic bacteria, Bacillus cereus, and not Yersinia). We are
currently conducting a case-control study to identify food items or
exposures the cases have
in common.
