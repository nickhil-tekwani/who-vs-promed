Mystery Disease Kills Coral on Great Barrier Reef
------------------
Scientists at the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) have
confirmed the existence of coral disease on the world's longest reef,
the Great Barrier Reef, which stretches along Australia's east coast.
Researchers at the government institute do not have to travel far to
see the giant reef (they just glance out their front door) but they
have searched the world for a clue to the cause of the disease they
have observed. AIMS scientists working in the long-term monitoring
program say the disease they have documented is in a broad category
known as White Syndrome. Soon they hope to learn exactly what White
Syndrome is.
Cathie Page, a deep ocean ecologist on the AIMS long term monitoring
team, says, "It's more common on table corals. It starts at the base
and works its way up. The disease breaks the coral tissue down,
eventually killing it."
"It doesn't fit the description of diseases found anywhere else in
the world, so it might be specific to the Pacific," she says. In the
3 years Page has been on the monitoring team, she has logged about
450 dives spanning 48 reefs. She has seen White Syndrome kill at
varying rates.
"It could kill a colony of 2 metres (6.5 feet) in diameter in 2 weeks
but in some other cases, it takes months to kill a large colony," she
said.
The first record of coral diseases came from reefs off Belize and
Florida in 1973. In 1993 coral diseases were noticed on the Great
Barrier Reef. When the diseases worsened in the late 1990s, the
long-term monitoring team started documenting their activity. In
1999 only 7 reefs were infected with White Syndrome; in 2002 33
reefs were affected out of the 48 studied by the AIMS long-term
monitoring team.
The highest number of infected colonies within one reef was 101 in a
1500-square-meter area. That was on Carter Reef, an outer shelf reef
in the Cooktown/Lizard Island sector. The syndrome killed those
colonies infected and caused a decline in hard coral cover on this
reef.
AIMS scientists together with researchers from James Cook University
who are collaborating on the project have recorded the disease in
northern waters during the winter months. Outer-shelf reefs near
Lizard Island off Cooktown in the northern Great Barrier Reef and the
Capricorn Bunker reefs in the southern Great Barrier Reef are the
worst affected areas.
White Syndrome outbreaks are happening in pristine areas of the Great
Barrier Reef, the AIMS teams says, on outer reefs untouched by
coastal development and tourism. This means the reef diseases are not
linked to pollution, as are other coral diseases around the world.
Coral bleaching is also affecting the great reef, and scientists fear
White Syndrome could be spreading more quickly in corals weakened by
bleaching.
Coral bleaching is the name given to an event in which coral expel
their symbiotic algae due to extreme stress, such as unusually hot
water, according to AIMS bleaching expert Dr. Terry Done.
The bleached corals die if the stress is extreme or prolonged. With
rising water temperatures over the tropical summers, coral bleaching
events are more widespread and happening more often, leaving little
time for coral to recover.
"Bleached coral is not healthy and potentially more susceptible to
diseases," said Page. "We don't know what's causing this disease.
It's microscopic; it could be a range of things."
AIMS has sent samples of corals affected by White Syndrome away for
testing. When the results come back, AIMS will search for solutions
that might save the corals of the Great Barrier Reef.

[The coral reef bleaching is a serious problem for the ocean life
that live in and around the reef, but the devastation of the reef has
consequences for the land mass that the reef protects as well. There
are many theories, including the rise in ocean water temperatures as
reflected by our warming climate, a potential effect of El Nino, and
even contamination due to human waste. It may be a combination of
these that has allowed the problem to escalate, but whatever the
cause, it is affecting the reefs on almost a worldwide basis. -
