[The following has been generously provided by the USDA/APHIS officer, Bill
White, who visited the site at the time of the diagnosis.
Prior to the confirmed anthrax case, 6 medium sized calves (450-500 pounds)
and 1 adult cow (1100-1200 pounds, 4 years old) had died from June through
August 1997. These carcasses were still lying exposed on the pasture during
my visit. The next day (Sept 10), following my recommendations, the owner
covered all the carcasses with lime (quick-lime), dug a 3-4 feet deep hole,
limed the interior of the hole, pushed in the carcasses, and added another
layer of lime. He also buried some of the topsoil immediately under the
carcasses.
To summarize the history, six medium calves and one cow died before the
anthrax-positive cow died. These 7 animals died from June 23 through August
25, and none were examined, treated or necropsied by a veterinarian. The
suspected diagnosis by the owner in all cases was "petroleum" poisoning,
which he linked to two events: animals entering a nearby Reserve Pit
containing recycled oil drilling fluids on June 20, and an oil spill onto
the oil well pad on July 27. When the anthrax-positive cow died on Sept 4,
both the owner and oil company (who had compensated the owner for the
previous 7 dead animals for suspected petroleum toxicity) decided it was
time to confirm a diagnosis. This eighth animal, a 4 year old adult beef
cow, was necropsied (unfortunately) by the local veterinarian, which
resulted in the anthrax confirmation.
Six people who helped move the cow to the vet clinic, the veterinarian, and
her family were put immediately on antibiotics after the diagnosis was
confirmed.
Regarding clinical signs of the 7 undiagnosed deaths, the owner could only
give vague signs of the animals appearing listless and losing some weight
before dieing suddenly. Petroleum poisoning is not an uncommon diagnosis in
that part of NM where animals graze alongside oil wells. A local "laboratory"
which diagnoses all forms of toxicities, organ malfunctions, parasites, etc.
simply from a drop of serum under dark-field microscope, did not help the
situation by diagnosing "hydrocarbon" poisoning on the fifth animal above
that died.
During my investigation on Sept 9, there were 32 adult cows (4 year olds),
28 older calves, and about 8 suckling calves. All were bright, alert and
healthy in appearance, except for the 10 day old bull calf from the
anthrax-positive cow, and another older calf, both of which appeared thin.
The bull calf was trying to suckle milk from other cows as best it could. It
was a closed herd, except for a breeding bull that had been introduced
temporarily for breeding and then removed; it had been removed 6 months
prior to the outbreak. The herd thus consisted of 32 mother cows (beef mix
breeds) and their 2nd and 3rd calves. Their first calves had been sent to an
out of state feedlot for fattening. They grazed on good quality pasture
(mainly buffalo grass, blue gramma grass and side oats, with patches of
tabosa grass, small mesquite bushes, and cat claws) that was fenced and 1.5
sections in size (1 by 1.5 miles). The owner vaccinated for Clostridial
diseases, but not anthrax, of course. He had been leasing this property for
15 years, and had never seen anthrax, although earlier generations of his
family used to talk about the disease.
The above pasture contained a windmill which emptied water into a galvanized
reservoir and overflowed into a one acre lagoon. And it contained a newly
built oil well in the northern end of the pasture. This oil well, and the
gravel road that led from the pasture to the main road, was built in Jan or
Feb 1997 (owner couldn't remember exact date). The hypothesis is that
construction on the oil well and road may have unearthed an anthrax grave,
exposing the confirmed positive animal. The 7 animals that died prior to
this cow, could have died from petroleum poisoning, anthrax, or a myriad of
other causes.
The above was reconstructed from the records of the owner, who was very
cooperative and well prepared for the interview. He holds a degree in animal
science, and is a professional beef producer. In addition to the above
affected premises, he owns or leases 6 other premises in which he raises
beef calves for feedlot production.

[This history demonstrates nicely how if one is not expecting anthrax it can
be readily missed. Please excuse the delays in posting this but I had to
have Bill's permission to quote his report before posting it and I am only
just back from Kazakhstan. At the latter anthrax meeting evidence was
produced which clearly indicates that burying anthrax carcasses may be an
excellent way of ensuring future cases. Burning carcasses should be the
priority. MHJ
