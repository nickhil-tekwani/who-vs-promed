As of today [15 Mar 2011], 3 people have been killed by plague in
Ambohimangakely [Antananarivo]. Yesterday [14 Mar 2011], at about 5 in
the morning, an 8-year-old girl died from pneumonic plague. Her family
refuses to admit [the diagnosis] but the medical inspector of
Antananarivo-Avaradrano, Minoso Saholy Razafindravao, stated that the
2 tests performed confirmed it.

"My daughter told me she had a stomach ache. But she was able to play
as usual. In our home, when we are sick, the doctors quickly conclude
that every case is the plague," comments the mother of the victim. On
the other hand, the medical inspector reaffirms his case. "We sent the
results to the Institut Pasteur of Madagascar. We will know in 10 days
if it is indeed the plague," she said.

Chemoprophylaxis (preventive treatment) was given to all persons who
had direct contact with the victim. Area family homes have been
sanitized and disinfected.

Plague has hit where it was least expected. 15 people have died from
this disease in parts of the enclave district of Ambilobe [Diana
region]. Other deaths occurred in the area of Brickaville [Atsinanana
region]. The populations of the villages concerned, hardly familiar
with the symptoms of the disease, have been slow to reach out to
medical centers and the appropriate means to fight against this
epidemic have been slow to reach them.

In total, 45 cases of plague have been detected in Madagascar since
the beginning of the year [2011], and 23 people have died.

Plague occurs in Madagascar almost every year, with outbreaks taking
place between October and April, when the combined effects of the
rainy season and drought period affect the food: hygienic conditions
deteriorate and rats begin to enter the villages.

[It is not clear from this report whether the cases are pneumonic or
bubonic plague. A high mortality rate suggests many are pneumonic
plague, which is the form that can transmit from person-to-person. -

[An article from L'Express de Madagascar
(<http://www.lexpressmada.com/epidemie-madagascar/21168-dix-neuf-victimes-de-la-peste-en-une-semaine.html>
in French), dated 22 Feb 2011, reports 14 deaths from pneumonic plague
in a village located 65 km [40 mi] from the district of Ambilobe
(Diana region) and 3 deaths also from pneumonic plague in the district
of Brickaville (Atsinanana region). It further reports the death from
bubonic plague of a 10-year-old girl in Ambohimangakely, near the
Capital city (Antananarivo).
