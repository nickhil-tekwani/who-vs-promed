Koi Herpesvirus infection in Indonesia: Suspicion
--------------------------------------------------
Extract from a report by Dr Akhmad Rukyani, Director, Directorate of Fish
Health and Environment, Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries, Jakarta,
received on 26 June 2002 from Dr Sofjan Sudarjat, Director General of
Livestock Services, Department of Agriculture, Jakarta:
Report date: 26 Jun 2002.
A serious disease outbreak among koi carp and common carp (_Cyprinus
carpio_) is currently occurring in Indonesia, having started in the area of
Blitar in East Java in mid-April 2002. Since then, it has spread rapidly
throughout Java Island, causing very high mortality (80-90 percent) in both
common carp and koi carp, with an estimated loss of more than 50 billion IDR
(approximately 5 million USD).
Diagnosis
-----------
Clinical signs in infected fish include severe gill necrosis, lots of mucus,
superficial haemorrhages, fin rot and enlargement of kidney and liver with
haemorrhages and discoloration.
Preliminary investigations conducted by the Fish Health Officers from the
Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries, suggest a viral infection based on
the pattern of outbreak and the clinical signs characteristic of herpesvirus
of koi carp (KHV). Laboratory examinations are in progress.
Epidemiology
---------------
Indonesia has not experienced a disease of this nature in the past. The
disease is suspected to have been introduced through importation of koi carp
from another country.
Control measures
-------------------
No clear effective measures can be applied to control the disease. The
Government of Indonesia has officially declared Java Island as an isolated
area for the disease. The movement of koi carp and common carp from Java
Island to other islands is strictly prohibited. In addition, importation of
koi carp and common carp into Indonesia is temporarily not permitted.

[Since 1998, mass mortality among fingerling, juvenile and adult common carp
(_Cyprinus carpio carpio_) and fancy carp or koi (_Cyprinus carpio koi_)
have occurred in the U.S.A (California), Western Europe and Israel
(Bretzinger et al, 1999; Neukirch et al, 1999; Body et al, 2000; Hedrick et
al, 2000). Several of these outbreaks have been shown to be due to systemic
infections with a newly recognized virus, the koi herpesvirus or KHV
(Hedrick et al, 2000). Initial characteristics of the virus demonstrate that
it is clearly different from _Herpesvirus cyprini_ (CHV), the most commonly
known herpesvirus from cyprinid fish.
Recently, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was developed to detect
the virus in koi (Gilad et al, 2002); for abstract see
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_u
ids=12005231&dopt=Abstract>
It is of great importance to investigate the relation between the virus
causing the current outbreak in Indonesia and KHV. Should it spread into
south-east Asia and the Far East, KHV seems to have the potential to cause
severe damage to the intensive aquaculture in this region and to the
fish-dependent population there.
Those involved with aquaculture and fish health, anywhere, are urged to
report on similar observations. The virus might be more widely distributed
than published. - Mod AS].
