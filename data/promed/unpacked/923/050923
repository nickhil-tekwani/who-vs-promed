Fatal brain disease still found in deer in southern Wisconsin
-------------------------------------------------------------
Wildlife experts are continuing to find deer infected with a fatal brain
disease in southern Wisconsin this fall, with all but one found in the area
where the ailment already was detected. Of 6100 deer tested for chronic
wasting disease (CWD) so far in 2004, 22 had the fatal disease, the state
Department of Natural Resources reported on Wednesday.
One deer with the disease was found near Plain in Sauk County, which puts
the disease farther north of the Lower Wisconsin River than other infected
deer, said Bill VanderZouwen, the DNR's chief of wildlife ecology. "We
already knew we had positive cases north of the river. We expected those
weren't the only ones," he said. "You hate to find it any farther out than
you have already, but it is not unexpected."
The new case means the state's so-called disease eradication zone may
likely be enlarged again next fall, said VanderZouwen and Alan Crossley,
the DNR's chronic wasting disease leader. The zone is where the state wants
the size of the deer herd drastically reduced to stop the spread of the
disease.
This fall was the third hunting season since chronic wasting disease was
discovered in February 2001 in 3 deer killed near Mount Horeb. Since then,
the DNR has found 346 deer with the disease in 9 counties, from Walworth
and Kenosha counties in the east to Iowa and Richland counties in the west.
But 326 of the diseased deer have been found in 2 counties -- Dane and Iowa.
Over the years, the disease eradication zone has grown from about 400
square miles to about 1300 square miles, VanderZouwen said.
All the 22 diseased deer found so far this year were within areas already
known to have the disease or adjacent to it, the DNR said. "Obviously, it
is not all over the place and that is good news," VanderZouwen said. "And
it's a relatively small percentage of the deer that have it and that's no
change."
It's too early to tell from the 2004 testing whether the percentage of deer
that have the disease is any different from the previous 2 years, he said.
Samples have been gathered from 15 607 deer, and more than half await
testing, he said.
3 years ago, the DNR's strategy for dealing with the disease called for
killing all the deer where the ailment was found in an attempt to wipe the
disease out of the wild herd. "I haven't seen enough to discourage me from
going after that goal," VanderZouwen said on Wednesday. "It is possible
someday we will learn something that will keep us from going there."
According to Crossley, 3 years of dealing with the disease have led to some
conclusions:
- the prevalence of the disease is higher in older bucks.
- the higher the density of deer, the higher the prevalence.
- there does not appear to be genetic resistance to the disease among deer.
Experts believe the disease could have first appeared in the herd from 7 to
12 years ago, Crossley said. "We are confident it has not been here a long,
long time. It is a relatively recent thing," he said. "How recent, I don't
think anyone can say."
