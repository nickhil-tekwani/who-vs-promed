Sierra Leone
------------
The World Health Organization was notified on 25 May 2014 of an Ebola virus disease [EVD] outbreak in Sierra Leone. Preliminary information received from the field indicates that one laboratory confirmed case and 5 community deaths have been reported from Koindu chiefdom. This chiefdom shares border with the current Ebola virus disease hotspot Gueckedou in Guinea. The laboratory analysis of the case was done at the VHF [viral hemorrhagic fever] laboratory in Kenema, Sierra Leone.

While waiting for additional epidemiological information, the following measures have been initiated by national authorities with support from WHO: meeting of the national emergency Ebola task force to discuss the current situation and proposed preventive and response measures to be implemented immediately; deployment of a team to the field to conduct epidemiological investigations and initiation of preliminary response measures and development of funding proposals based on the existing national EVD preparedness and response plan.

WHO held a 3-level coordination meeting to review the current situation, carry out risk assessment based on available data and information, and measures to be taken to control the outbreak. These include among others:
- immediate deployment of 6 international experts in the areas of coordination, epidemiology, social mobilization, case management/infection prevention and control, data management, and logistics;
- provision of catalytic funds by WHO to support initial investigation and response activities;
- development of proposals to access the African Public Health Emergency Fund (funding mechanism established by all the Ministers of Health in the WHO African Region) and other funding sources; and
- deployment of essential supplies and reagents.

WHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event.

[This is the 1st case in Sierra Leone not imported from Guinea like the previous 2 in April 2014 -- see ProMED-mail Ebola virus disease - West Africa (05): Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone WHO update 20140401.2373662.

Koindu Town, Kailahun district [not to be confused with Koidu Town, Kono District, also in the Eastern Province of Sierra Leone] is about 70 km (44 mi) across the border as the crow flies from Gueckedou, the original and still active focus of EVD in Guinea, see map at http://maps.maphill.com/sierra-leone/eastern/kailahun/simple-maps/blank-map/blank-simple-map-of-kailahun.jpg. But there is no direct road. Koindu is much closer to the border of the Foya area in Liberia, which had a fatal case of EVD in early April 2014.

This is a serious set-back for the effort to control the outbreak in the forested area where 3 countries meet -- see map at http://bit.ly/1jmMo8n.

It is very fortunate that Sierra Leone already had a VHF lab set up for diagnosing Lassa fever cases, which had been provided with ebolavirus diagnostic lab equipment and training on its use by Metabiota. Let us hope all contacts have agreed not to leave the area -- above all, not to go to the capital, Freetown (except for the international experts who will have taken strict precautions to avoid infection). - Mod.JW
