A veterinarian and 11 people who work at a York, Nebraska, pet shelter will
undergo rabies vaccinations after having contact with a rabid dog. The
spaniel-type hunting dog was euthanized 11 Feb 2003, but it bit attending
veterinarian Dr. Christi Hafer before the shot could be administered.

"He went ballistic when we tried to restrain him," said Gail Nordlund,
manager of York Adopt-A-Pet who was present for the procedure.

"He was fighting us and he got ahold of my hand," Hafer said. "It tore the
skin and bled quite a bit."

Nordlund had her head close to the animal, trying to remove its teeth from
Hafer's hand when saliva from the thrashing dog got into Nordlund's mouth.

The dog was tested for rabies because it had no known vaccination history.
The results came back positive Friday.

10 volunteers at the shelter will also undergo rabies vaccinations,
Nordlund said. "The dog actually kissed them, licked them," she said.
"That's why they're concerned."

All volunteers were offered the vaccination, but Nordlund said others
didn't feel they were in danger. "Another 6 felt they had no contact, and
they're not going to do it," she said.

The rabies vaccination -- a series of 5 shots -- are being given at York
General Hospital.

"It isn't fun, but it's not the horror story I've always heard," said
Nordlund, who had taken 2 of the 5 shots. Her treatment is scheduled to end
14 Mar 2003. Because she had pre-exposure shots in her veterinarian
training, Hafer only has to take 2 additional shots. [Supposedly this is
Post-Exposure Prophylaxis, PEP. - Mod.TG]

The workers' personal insurance will pay for the shots, which could cost up
to $3000, but Nordlund said the hospital waived the costs for a couple of
volunteers that did not have insurance.

3 other cases of rabies have been reported this year in the state,
including a dog and a skunk in Hall County and a skunk in Fillmore County.

2 people were exposed to rabies while caring for the dog. Owners of that
animal received preventive treatment for rabies from their family doctor.
No human exposure was reported in the other cases.

27 rabies cases were reported last year and 12 in 2001. 3 were reported in
2000, state health officials have reported.

The hunting dog was found in the country in mid-December 2002. Nordlund
said it appeared someone had taken good care of the animal. "It was
well-kept, neutered, it looked like a lost dog," she said. However, the
dog had behavior problems.

"It wasn't good with strangers," she said of her decision to euthanize the
animal. "I gave him a chance, but I didn't feel he was adoptable."

Nordlund said dog owners that do not get rabies shots put people and other
animals at risk. "It puts the dog in jeopardy, then we pick him up and
look what happens," she said.

Rabies tests can only be conducted from the brain tissue from dead animals.
That means the rabies shots -- which cost about $10 -- can prevent a lot of
heartache for owners if the animal were to bite someone and have to be put
down.

"It's very cheap insurance," Hafer said.

[A rabies vaccine is indeed one of the cheapest forms of insurance that can
be provided to a animal and its owner family. Rabies vaccine is available
for livestock as well. Horses should be vaccinated, and if you have
interaction with cattle, such as in a show, then these animals should be
vaccinated also.

Veterinarians, technicians, and shelter workers should all have the
pre-exposure rabies vaccine.

This case clearly demonstrates that not all rabies cases produce wild
behavior and excess salivation. There are 2 kinds of rabies manifestation:
the dumb form and the furious form. The furious form is the one most people
associate with rabies, the very wild and unusual behavior and the excess
salivation. The dumb or quiet form is more difficult to recognize, but the
animal may be quiet, even withdrawn, and may still have the virus. - Mod.TG]
