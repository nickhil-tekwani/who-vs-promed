Two more Minnesotans and a Wisconsin man were sickened in the _E. coli_
outbreak linked to ground beef from a Wisconsin meat packer and sold at Cub
Foods and other stores, bringing the number of illnesses to at least 43.
At least 36 Minnesotans have been sickened in the outbreak.
The 2 latest Minnesota victims are an 18-year-old woman from Mankato and a
67-year-old woman from Fridley, state Department of Health spokesman Buddy
Ferguson said Monday. Both were hospitalized, but have been released.
Wisconsin health officials said Monday that a man from Eau Claire also has
been infected by the _E. coli_ subtype linked to the outbreak. The man,
who reported that he had eaten some of the hamburger involved in the
recall, became ill on 7 Dec 2000, Wisconsin health officials said. The
Wisconsin man brings that state's total cases to 6.
Iowa health officials said a woman there was sickened by the same _E. coli_
subtype, but more investigation is needed to confirm that her illness is
linked to the same outbreak.
Minnesota health and agriculture officials issued a statement Thursday
saying they are confident that ground beef produced at American Foods Group
Inc. on 2 and 3 Nov can be linked to the initial _E. coli_ illnesses in
Minnesota.
The Green Bay, WI, meat processor has recalled more than 1 million pounds
of ground beef in 23 states.
Meanwhile, 2 Minnesotans remain hospitalized in the outbreak: a 2-year-old
girl from Dakota County and a 6-year-old girl from Houston County. Both
have developed a rare _E. coli_ complication that can lead to kidney
failure and is potentially fatal.
