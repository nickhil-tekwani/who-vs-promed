Egypt: 13 Suspected H5N1 Bird Flu Cases Held in Menoufiya
---------------------------------------------------------
A total of 13 cases suspected of being H5N1 bird-flu positive have been quarantined in the Nile Delta city of Menoufiya [governorate], the director of preventive medicine department said on Wednesday [14 Jan 2015].

Samples from the suspected patients will be sent for analysis at the central labs, Department Director, Reda Aish, said.

A 65-year-old woman from Assiut governorate died in hospital earlier on Wednesday [14 Jan 2015; see ProMED-mail post Avian influenza, human (11): Egypt H5N1, China H7N9 (SZ, Mainland) 20150114.3093018 - Mod.LK] after being diagnosed with H5N1, the health ministry announced.

At least 12 people have contracted the virus this year [2015]; 2 cases have died, 7 remain under treatment, and 3 have recovered, the health ministry said.

Infection is usually centered in rural areas, where citizens, especially women, frequently come in direct contact with live poultry.

The World Health Organisation warned that there is a risk of human infection when the virus is circulating in poultry, especially to those in infected environments.
