Matsakis airs doubts over FMD outbreak
--------------------------------------
M.E.P. [Member European Parliament] Marios Matsakis has aired his
doubts over the recent foot and mouth [FMD] outbreak in a letter to
European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso. In the letter,
Matsakis said for the past 6 weeks the farmers in Cyprus have been
given conflicting and confusing results and statements by the
Commission as to whether there was or was not an epidemic of FMD in
Cyprus. He said measures were sometimes strict, sometimes mild and
partial and sometimes totally absent.

"All this uncertainty and seemingly haphazard way of dealing with
such a serious issue has been causing severe hardship to thousands of
farmers and other people involved in the farming industry," Matsakis said.

He also said it damaged the economy. Quoting both EU and Cypriot
authorities in the past week that Cyprus has what he called
"non-active, non-infective" FMD, Matsakis questioned the procedures
that had been carried out throughout the entire saga. He asked
Barosso to clearly state whether or not there is, or is not, an
epidemic in Cyprus, could there be an epidemic with a "non-active"
virus and if so was what was the purpose of taking restrictions if
the virus was non infective to other animals.

"The farmers of Cyprus and the Cypriot public in general are fed up
with the way the apparent 'outbreak' has been handled at Commission
level and at the Cyprus Ministry of Agriculture level," said
Matsakis. "It is not clear to most Cypriots that we do not have an
FMD epidemic on the island."

He asked that the Commission lift all measures against Cypriot farmer
immediately.

Earlier this week, the European Commission lifted a ban on exports of
pork meat originating outside the 10km [6.2-mile] surveillance zone,
but kept in place all other restrictions.

[M.E.P. Matsakis' current view on the FMD "outbreak" in Cyprus is not
far from ProMED-mail's view, as expressed in the various commentaries
published since the very onset of the event at the end of October 2007.

The suspicion of FMD in Dromomay have been the outcome of clinical
misdiagnosis of the observed buccal lesions (probably caused by
bluetongue), combined with the unfortunate presence of seropositive
adult sheep in a number of flocks throughout Cyprus. It is assumed
that those sheep had probably been vaccinated against FMD, some time
back, on the Island or elsewhere. Typically, no clinical evidence for
FMD could be discovered in cattle and pigs in the vicinity of
positive sheep; neither could antibodies be demonstrated in these species.

For more details, including the serological surveillance results
(slide 3), locations of the seropositive sheep (slide 5) and their
age distribution (slides 7 and 8), readers are referred to the recent
report "FMD in Cyprus." The report was presented by the Veterinary
Services of Cyprus during the last meeting of SCOFCAH, EU's Standing
Committee on Food Chain and Animal Health formerly known as the
Standing Veterinary Committee (SVC), held in Brussels on 3-4 Dec
2007. The presentation is available at
