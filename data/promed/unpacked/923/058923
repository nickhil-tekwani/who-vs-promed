[The places named, Metchosin, Saanich and Esquimalt are municipalities
within greater Victoria. - Mod.MHJ]
Two rabid bats have been captured in the capital region, and British
Columbians are being warned to stay clear of friendly flying mammals. Nine
Greater Victoria residents - six adults and three teens - are undergoing
immunization treatments after handling a rabid silver-haired bat at
Matheson Lake in Metchosin recently.
Capital Health Region medical officer Richard Stanwick said Wednesday a
province-wide alert is being sent out for people to stay clear of bats
exhibiting abnormal behavior, and to ensure all pets are vaccinated.
"People don't realize a bat who has lost its fear of humans and is out
during the day is displaying very aberrant behavior. When these bats are
sick with rabies, they are very friendly."
Stanwick said in the Matheson Lake case people held the bat as it licked
them. One man let it crawl up and down his pant leg. A rabid animal doesn't
have to bite people to infect them. Rabies is easily transmitted through
saliva. "Bats are like cats. They groom themselves a lot. They basically
coat themselves with their own saliva. And the rabies virus is in their
spit."
A rabid brown bat was found in Central Saanich last week. The person
involved realized "a bat sunning himself on a fence post wasn't normal
behavior." The person wore heavy gloves and put the bat in a container and
took it to the SPCA, as the Health Ministry advises people to do in all
suspicious cases.
A third bat found in Esquimalt, and suspected to have rabies, was shipped
off for testing Wednesday.
B.C. has a large bat population. Between two and 10 per cent have rabies.
They contract the disease from South American vampire bats while the two
species share winter breeding grounds in Mexico.
The nine people who came in contact with the rabid bat in Metchosin were
all immediately vaccinated and are expected to remain healthy. They were
given a single shot of rabies immune globulin, which contains antibodies to
neutralize the virus, and a vaccine made from killed rabies virus.
There have been no human cases of rabies in B.C. for 13 years but 64 people
have required immunization this year.
