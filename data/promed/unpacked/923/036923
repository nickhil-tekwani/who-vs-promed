[According to the current notification, the last year of FMD occurrence in Mauritania was 2006.

According to the Mauritania page in the website of the WRLFMD (Pirbright), the 2006 outbreak was caused by FMDV serotype A, and the country's FMD history (last recorded outbreaks) is the following:
FMDV-O: 2000-2001
FMDV-A: 1997, 2006
FMDV-C: 0000
FMDV-Asia 1: 0000
FMDV-SAT 1: 0000
FMDV-SAT 2: 1975-1976
FMDV-SAT 3: 0000

This is in compliance with Mauritania's annual reports to the OIE 2005-2013, according to which no outbreaks have been recorded since 2006. This means that FMD serotype SAT-2 has returned after an absence of 39 years (since 1977). Its possible origin and route of introduction deserve to be investigated; genotyping may be helpful.

According to the traditional definition of the term "Maghreb" (Arabic for west), this term used to refer to the region including the Atlas Mountains and the coastal plains of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya; this has been superseded, since the 1989 formation of the Arab Maghreb Union, by the inclusion of Mauritania and Western Sahara (mostly controlled by Morocco).

Morocco, which has managed to remain free from the FMD serotype O circulating since 2013-2014 in Libya, Tunisia and Algeria, should be on alert in view of the Mauritanian situation. - Mod.AS
