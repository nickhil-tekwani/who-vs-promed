The movement of pigs from 2 farms in Tanjung Sepat near Sepang has been
stopped after several of the animals were found to have been infected with
foot and mouth disease (FMD). The disease was detected 2 days ago. A team
of veterinarians combed the area and stopped the movement of pigs from the
farms.
Deputy agriculture and agro-based industry minister Datuk Seri Kerk Choo
Ting today said some of the animals were infected with the "type O" viral
strain, similar to the one which attacked pigs in Penang recently.
In November 2005, 2 pig farms in Nibong Tebal were ordered to be closed
after at least 10 pigs were found dead after showing FMD symptoms.
"We have stopped the movement of pigs in Tanjung Sepat and the ban will
only be lifted once the problem is resolved," Kerk said after launching a
forum on bird flu, organised by the KL Federal Territory Gerakan with its
youth and women's wings. He said there was no cause for alarm because FMD
could not spread to humans. FMD is an acute infectious viral disease that
causes fever, followed by the development of blisters around the mouth,
teats, nose and feet of an infected animal.
Earlier at the forum, participants were told that Malaysia had designated
21 hospitals nationwide to handle avian flu cases.
Dr Rosmawati Ariffin, who is the principal assistant director of the
Disease Control Division of the Ministry of Health, said these hospitals,
including the Kuala Lumpur Hospital, had facilities to isolate avian
influenza patients.

[Peninsular Malaysia reported 39 outbreaks in 1996, 39 in 1997, 10 in 1998,
9 in 1999, 3 in 2000, 189 in 2001, 39 in 2002 (incomplete outbreak number
but some 5760 individuals were affected), 21 in 2003, and 37 in 2004.
Apparently this is the first publicly reported FMD outbreak in Malaysia
this year with OIE yet to post an official report, though clearly there had
been an earlier outbreak in Penang, apparently 2 months ago. - Mod.MHJ]
