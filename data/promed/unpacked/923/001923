Bluetongue detected in an imported animal
-----------------------------------------
Defra (UK Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs) today
[14 Dec 2007] announced that bluetongue [BT] virus has been detected
in an imported cow on a premises near Middlesbrough, which is outside
the existing Bluetongue Protection and Surveillance Zones [see map at
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/notifiable/bluetongue/pdf/declaration-btv-pzsz021107-archive.pdf>.
- Mod. AS]

The animal originated from within a Protection Zone in Lower Saxony,
Germany, and was detected through routine post-import testing carried
out on all bluetongue susceptible animals entering the UK.

The farm near Middlesbrough has been placed under restrictions, and
the cow will be culled as it potentially provides a source of
infection for the local midge population, and therefore other
animals. A full epidemiological investigation is being undertaken on
the premises. Currently there is no evidence that virus is
circulating in the area, therefore there will be no changes to the
existing bluetongue zones and no new zones will be established at
this time.

Fred Landeg, Acting Chief Veterinary Officer said, "Importers need to
carefully consider the potential risks to UK industry as a whole from
importing animals from Bluetongue Restricted Zones."

A North Yorkshire farmer has spoken of his upset after a case of
bluetongue was discovered in his herd.

The virus was found in an imported cow at Woodhouse Farm, Great
Ayton, near Middlesbrough. It was later culled.

Farmer Stuart Fletcher said he had been importing cows for a number
of years because he was worried about the spread of bovine TB in the
UK. He did not want to speak publicly, but told the BBC he felt "very
bad" about the situation.

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) is
treating the incident as an isolated case, and no restrictions have
been imposed.

The cow had been imported from Lower Saxony in Germany and the virus
was confirmed through post-import testing carried out on all animals
entering the UK.

In the past year the virus has affected livestock across Germany,
Belgium, France, Luxembourg, and Holland.

A Defra spokesman said that under EU bluetongue regulations
susceptible animals can be moved out of restricted zones into free
zones. This can happen providing official vets certify all the
conditions have been met.

Mr Fletcher said the cow had shown no sign of the virus. He was aware
of anxiety in the surrounding area and felt "very bad" about the
situation.

He added that animals were not allowed to be taken off the farm. He
was not sure how long this would last, but was due to speak to Defra
on Monday [17 Dec 2007].

[An updated (12 Dec 2007) EU map of BT restriction zones is available at
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/BlueTongue_RestrictedZones.jpg>.
Vast areas in Europe, including the whole territory of Germany and a
considerable part of southeast UK (up to, but not including North
Yorkshire) are within the restriction zones.

It will be helpful to note what tests have been applied on the animal
in Germany prior to exportation, the dates of sampling and of
departure, and the measures applied to prevent infection during the
pre-export period, between sampling and departure/transportation. -
