First report of stem rot and wilt of sunflower caused by _Sclerotinia
minor_ in Spain
----------------------------------------------
ML Molinero-Ruiz, JM Melero-Vara, Department of Crop Protection, IAS-CSIC,
Apdo. 4084, Cordoba, Spain. Plant Dis 2002; 86: 697; published online as
D-2002-0419-02N, 2002. Accepted for publication 4 Apr 2002.
In 2001, sunflower (_Helianthus annuus_ L.) [expressing] symptoms of stem
and root rot and wilt were observed in Soria, Spain. Light brown,
water-soaked lesions developed on the collar of infected plants and
extended along the stem, affecting the pith and causing early and sudden
wilt. White mycelium and sclerotia (0.5 to 2 mm long) formed in the pith of
stems.
Sclerotia were disinfested in NaClO (10 per cent vol/vol) for 1 min,
transferred to potato dextrose agar (PDA), and incubated at 20 degrees C.
The fungus consistently obtained was identified as _Sclerotinia minor_
Jagger (1).
Pathogenicity was confirmed in a greenhouse experiment (15-25 degrees C, 13
h light). Seven week old plants of 6 sunflower genotypes ... ('Peredovik',
HA89, HA821, HA61, RHA274, and HA337) were inoculated by placing 1 PDA disk
with active mycelial growth adjacent to each basal stem just below the soil
line and covering it with peat/sand/silt (2:2:1, vol/vol). For each
genotype, 6 plants were inoculated without wounding, and another 6 were
inoculated immediately after stem base wounding with a scalpel; 6 wounded
and uninoculated plants were used as controls. First symptoms (wilting)
appeared 4 days after inoculation in all genotypes.
Two weeks after inoculation, between 33 and 92 per cent of plants were
dead (depending on cultivar), white mycelium was observed at the base of
affected plants, and sclerotia were present in the pith of diseased plants.
Plant wounding had no effect on disease incidence or severity, and the
fungus was reisolated from inoculated plants.
To our knowledge, this is the first report of _S. minor_ in Spain.

[According to information provided by plant pathologists at North Dakota
State University, Fargo, there are 3 diseases (wilt, middle stalk rot, and
head rot), all caused by _Sclerotinia_ spp. _S. sclerotiorum_ and _S.
minor_ both cause similar diseases in sunflower. _S. minor_ has not been
reported in the upper Great Plains of the United States, but does occur in
California and in the east coast vegetable production areas of the country.
Diseases of sunflower caused by _S. sclerotiorum_ and _S. minor_ can cause
severe crop losses. - Mod.DH]
