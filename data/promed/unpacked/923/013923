["Infectious haematopoietic necrosis (IHN) is a viral disease affecting most species of salmonid fish reared in fresh water or sea water. Caused by the _rhabdovirus_, infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV), the principal clinical and economic consequences of IHN occur on farms rearing rainbow trout where acute outbreaks can result in very high mortality. However, both Pacific and Atlantic salmon can be severely affected.

"Historically, the geographic range of IHN was limited to western North America, but the disease has spread to Europe and Asia via the importation of infected fish and eggs. Once IHNV is introduced into a farmed stock, the disease may become established among susceptible species of wild fish in the watershed.

"The disease is typically characterised by gross signs that include lethargy interspersed with bouts of frenzied, abnormal activity, darkening of the skin, pale gills, ascites, distended abdomen, exophthalmia, and petechial haemorrhages internally and externally." http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=2439&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_ihn.htm. - Mod.CRD
