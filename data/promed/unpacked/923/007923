Tick bite disease scare floods hospitals
----------------------------------------
Istanbul, Turkey, hospital workers said hundreds of the city's
residents have flocked to hospitals after a Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic
fever [CCHF] scare. Hospitals including Haseki, Okmeydani, and
Haydarpasa Numune said more than 500 residents sought treatment
during the weekend [17-18 May 2008] for tick bites after a woman died
of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever that was thought to have been
transmitted by a tick bite in the town of Sivas, Today's Zaman
[newspaper] reported Tuesday [20 May 2008].

Doctors said they performed tests on the patients and told them to
return if they suffer fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
Istanbul Provincial Health director Mehmet Bakar said Monday [19 May
2008] that citizens should avoid contact with ticks whenever
possible. "There has never been a CCHF incident in Istanbul. But this
does not mean that there won't be one in the future," he noted.

[The woman at the centre of this incident died on Thu 8 May 2008 at
Ankara Numune Hospital, where she had been transferred from a Karabuk
provincial hospital, hence the concern in Istanbul despite the
absence of cases in Istanbul.

In the past 5 years, 94 people have died in Turkey of Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever. People who come into contact with ticks have been
advised to seek medical treatment if symptoms of illness develop. The
local advice has been to warn against trying to remove a tick from
the body oneself, recommending instead that people go to the nearest
hospital or clinic for medical staff to remove the tick. - Mod.CP]
