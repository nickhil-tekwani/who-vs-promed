[In the 2 days since the last update (11 Oct 2018), there was a single newly confirmed case reported from Riyadh region. Notably this case had a history of contact with camels as the high-risk exposure. Since the beginning of October 2018, there have now been 4 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported from 3 different regions in Saudi Arabia (Riyadh, 2 cases; Najran and Makkah, 1 case each). Three of the 4 newly confirmed cases were primary cases associated with camel contact; the 4th case was in a household contact of a previously confirmed case. - Mod.MPP]

- At the end of September 2018, a total of 2260 laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), including 803 associated deaths (case-fatality rate: 35.5%) were reported globally; the majority of these cases were reported from Saudi Arabia (1882 cases, including 729 related deaths with a case-fatality rate of 38.7%).

- During the month of September [2018], a total of 14 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS were reported globally; 13 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported in Saudi Arabia, including 6 associated deaths, and 1 laboratory-confirmed case was reported in Republic of Korea. The cases from Saudi Arabia included 5 secondary infections: 2 symptomatic household contacts and 3 hospital-acquired infections.

- The demographic and epidemiological characteristics of reported cases, when compared during the same corresponding period of 2013 to 2018, do not show any significant difference or change. Owing to improved infection prevention and control practices in hospitals, the number of hospital-acquired cases of MERS has dropped significantly since 2015.

- The age group 50-59 years continues to be at highest risk for acquiring infection of primary cases. The age group 30-39 years is most at risk for secondary cases. The number of deaths is higher in the age group 50-59 years for primary cases and 70-79 years for secondary cases.

[MERS-CoV continues to circulate in Saudi Arabia with the occasional spillover into humans from camel exposure, or close contact with other cases. It clearly is an infection that has transmission enhanced in the healthcare environment when there are breaches in infection-control practices. While Saudi Arabia is clearly the epicenter for human cases, the virus is circulating in the dromedary population elsewhere in the Middle East, North Africa, and Pakistan.

During the month of September 2018, there were 13 newly confirmed cases in Saudi Arabia and 1 newly confirmed case in South Korea, the latter in an individual who had traveled to Saudi Arabia for business, with onset of illness occurring upon return to South Korea. Six of these 14 newly confirmed cases had fatal outcomes. Classifications of type of transmission involved for these 6 fatal cases included 1 with a history of camel exposure, 2 primary community acquired with no history of camel exposure, 2 following further investigation found to be healthcare associated, and 1 remaining unknown.

For those who are interested in drilled-down data on the MERS-CoV epidemiology, I highly recommend going to the URL link for this Situation Report where there are graphics and tables with more detailed information supporting the above given numbers.

It is hard to reconcile total number of cases from the variety of reports. The August situation report stated there had been a total of 2248 cases including 798 associated deaths. The current September report total is up to 2260 cases, including 803 associated deaths. Hence, that's 12 newly confirmed cases and 5 newly reported fatalities. - Mod.MPP
