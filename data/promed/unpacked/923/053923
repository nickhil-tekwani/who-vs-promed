Avian influenza (51): Viet Nam, H5N1 virus evolution
-----------------------------------
Further to your moderator's query ["The term 'China's disqualified chickens' is in need of clarification"]:

"Disqualified chickens" are spent hens/culled layers, which come in large numbers across the border, because they fetch higher prices in Vietnam than in China: Vietnam is still largely a live bird market, whereas the Chinese have gone much further in the processing, where it is harder to get rid of spent hens. When I was in Vietnam in June there was an estimate of about 50 000 live birds coming into the country per day illegally.
