Dr Kamron Chaisiri, a zone 14 public health inspector, warned the
public of dengue fever outbreak in an interview given in Surin
province in the Northeast, as almost 40 000 people across the country
have already developed the symptoms.

Among 37 728 patients who have the dengue fever, 27 were dead. The
Central region has been reported with the highest number of patients
followed by the North, the Northeast, and the South.

In Surin province, 1921 people reportedly have contracted the disease
during the 1st 7 months of this year [2011], although no death has
been reported. According to Dr Kamron, Buri Ram has 948 patients,
Chaiyaphum 499, Nakhon Ratchasima 429, and Surin 45.

Mosquitoes often breed at a much faster rate in the rainy season.
Their breeding grounds can be found anywhere even with little amount
of water. People are encouraged to keep their containers closed and
their house dry. People who have the disease will develop a headache,
sore eyes, a fever, and red rashes or a nose bleed. They should seek
medical attention immediately.

[in Spanish, trans. Mod.TY]

[The apparent discrepancy in figures between this report and the
earlier report mentioning 5000 cases can be explained by different
reporting systems. The earlier report of 5000 cases includes all
cases reported to the Ministry of Health from all Health Care provider
networks, whereas his current report of 2006 cases are those cases
seen by the Social Security Health Provider Network alone and does not
include those cases seen by the Ministry of Health Providers or other
provider networks. - Mod.MPP]
