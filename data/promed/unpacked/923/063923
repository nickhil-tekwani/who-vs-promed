Bangladesh mass poisoning mystery solved
----------------------------------------
One of the world's great poisoning mysteries may have been solved --
the source of the arsenic that turns up in lethal quantities in
hundreds of thousands of wells across Bangladesh. The answer is ponds.

Bangladesh occupies the flood-prone delta of the river Ganges. In the
past half-century, villagers have had to dig pits for soil to raise
their homes above the floods. Water-filled pits cover roughly a tenth
of the delta, and appear to be poisoning the wells Bangladeshis sink
for drinking water.

Organic carbon in silt and sewage settles on the bottom of the
stagnant ponds and seeps underground, where it is eaten by microbes.
This microbial oxidation releases arsenic already in the delta silt --
it washed down into the delta from the Himalayas over thousands of
years. The arsenic dissolves in underground water and is tapped by
village wells.

Rebecca Neumann of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and
colleagues, cracked the problem after 7 years spent plotting the
chemistry and underground flows of water beneath villages near Dhaka.
She found that oxidation only occurs beneath the stagnant ponds. In
contrast, oxygen-rich rice paddies trap the arsenic in soils at the
surface.

Future poisoning?
-----------------
As long as Bangladeshis drank surface water they were safe. In the
late 1970s the country switched to ground water and since then Neumann
estimates arsenic has poisoned 2 million Bangladeshis. Luckily for
rice eaters, arsenic in the paddy fields is usually flushed away
during the monsoon season.

Neumann's analysis reveals that most of the arsenic in well water
today seeped underground from ponds dug about 50 years ago, though
pits are still being dug today, which could exacerbate poisoning in
future.

However, John McArthur of University College London published a study
last year [2008] showing no link between ponds and arsenic across the
border in West Bengal. "Ponds may have an effect locally, but in the
big picture, they may not be so important," he says. But Neumann
recommends Bangladeshis play safe by sinking wells away from ponds.

[For an explanation of what the effects of arsenic are, readers are
encouraged to see ProMED-mail post 20080920.2965.

The explanation above for the wide spread arsenic makes some sense,
but it seems like it either went unrecognized or unreported for a very
long time.
