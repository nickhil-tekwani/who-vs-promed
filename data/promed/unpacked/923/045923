Event started on 3 Feb 2022. A total of one outbreak (submitted) has been reported to date [16 Feb 2022]. HPAI subtype H5N1 was detected in a barnacle goose and a red fox (_Vulpes vulpes_) in Benduff, Donegal. The barnacle goose has been reported in the HPAI A H5N1 event from Ireland (see evt_4049 at https://wahis.oie.int/#/report-info?reportId=48673).

[Readers are encouraged to read the following scientific articles titled "Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H5N1) infection in red foxes fed infected bird carcasses" (1) from 2008 and "Highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus in wild red foxes, the Netherlands, 2021" (2). The articles' respective abstracts and reference citations follow below:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[1] Abstract
------------
"Eating infected wild birds may put wild carnivores at high risk for infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus (H5N1). To determine whether red foxes (_Vulpes vulpes_) are susceptible to infection with HPAI virus (H5N1), we infected 3 foxes intratracheally. They excreted virus pharyngeally for 3-7 days at peak titers of 103.5-105.2 median tissue culture infective dose (TCID50)/mL and had severe pneumonia, myocarditis, and encephalitis. To determine whether foxes can become infected by the presumed natural route, we fed infected bird carcasses to 3 other red foxes. These foxes excreted virus pharyngeally for 3-5 days at peak titers of 104.2-104.5 TCID50/mL, but only mild or no pneumonia developed. This study demonstrates that red foxes fed bird carcasses infected with HPAI virus (H5N1) can excrete virus while remaining free of severe disease, thereby potentially playing a role in virus dispersal."

[2] Abstract
------------
"We detected infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus clade 2.3.4.4b in 2 red fox (_Vulpes vulpes_) cubs found in the wild with neurologic signs in the Netherlands. The virus is related to avian influenza viruses found in wild birds in the same area."

"The 1st outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza subtype H5N1 (HPAI H5N1) in poultry in Ireland was confirmed on 20 Nov 2021. Between 20 Nov 2021 and 20 Dec 2021, 6 outbreaks of HPAI H5N1 were confirmed in poultry flocks in Ireland. As a result, restriction zones consisting of a 3-km minimum radius Protection Zone and a 10-km minimum radius Surveillance Zone were put in place. Following appropriate disease control measures, and in accordance with EU and national legislation, all restriction zones have now been removed."

"Avian influenza continues to be reported in wild birds across Ireland. It is essential to keep all poultry confined away from access to wild birds and implement appropriate biosecurity measures to prevent spread of disease from the wild bird population to Ireland's poultry flocks" (https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/50ce4-avian-influenza-bird-flu/#what-is-the-current-situation-with-avian-influenza).
