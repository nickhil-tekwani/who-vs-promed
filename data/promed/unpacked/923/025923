A patient with Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) passed away at a Peshawar [Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province] hospital on Saturday [12 Jul 2014] as cases of the deadly disease continue to pile up, local media reports said on Sunday [13 Jul 2014].

According to media reports, 3 patients suffering from CCHF were brought to Peshawar's Hayatabad Medical Complex [HMC] on Friday [11 Jul 2014]. They were identified as 57-year-old person from Peshawar, and a man and woman, from Afghanistan. The man died the next day.

As per the hospital data, 11 Congo virus patients, including 6 from Afghanistan and one staffer, have been brought to HMC. Of these 11, 5 have died.

Transmission modes
------------------
According to the World Health Organization, CCHF is primarily transmitted to people from ticks and livestock. Humans can catch the virus from other humans if they come in close contact with the infected person's blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids.

A study published in the journal Frontiers in Physiology in July 2012 states, "Vector-borne diseases (such as CCHF or dengue fever) in people, as well as livestock, are common in K-P [Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province] and FATA [Federally Administered Tribal Areas] due to the limited use of vector control measures and access to livestock vaccines."

"CCHF outbreaks typically occur following the migrations of nomadic people and livestock to district centres where they bring animals to sell and slaughter," the study adds.

[The number of CCHF virus infections has increased from 8 on 12 Jul 2014 to 11 infections 4 days later. CCHF virus is endemic in Pakistan and Afganistan. It is not clear if 2 of these infections above were acquired in Pakistan or in Afganistan. CCHF virus is a tick-borne virus in the genus _Nairovirus_, family _Bunyaviridae_. The virus can cause severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent. The virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp. ticks or through contact with infected human blood or animal blood and tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Exposure in health care facilities also occurs. The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days.
