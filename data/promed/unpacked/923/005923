It is not yet certain where the myxoma virus came from in Finland or whether it can spread to hare and hare [sic]. In late summer [2020] the animal disease, which was first observed in Finland [in July 2020], is spreading in city rabbits in Espoo and western Helsinki.

More than 30 wild rabbits have been brought to Korkeasaari Wildlife Hospital [to be euthanised because of] a [newly arrived] viral disease called myxomatosis. [As many as] 4 wild rabbits have been brought in a day, says the animal keeper Laura Pulli from Korkeasaari Wildlife Hospital. According to Pulli, the rabbits brought to Korkeasaari have been lean and in poor condition. As one of the [signs] of the disease, the rabbit's eyes are so wet that, according to Pull, they are almost closed. "After that, the rabbits don't see anything. They stay in place to squat, they can't even eat."

The infected wild rabbits cannot be cured or helped other than by taking them to a wildlife hospital or city veterinarian for euthanasia. People or even dogs do not get the disease. A vaccine against the virus can be obtained for pet rabbits. "The virus could come to a pet rabbit with a mosquito flying in from a window"

The Food Agency announced at the end of July [2020] that myxomatosis was found in a dead rabbit in Espoo for the 1st time in Finland. Myxoma virus is found in rabbit strains in Europe, Australia, and the Americas. Specialist researcher at the Food Agency Minna Nylundin said it is unclear [how] the virus spread to Finland. It is not yet certain whether the myxoma virus can spread from hare to hare in Finland. So far, no cases have come to the attention of the Food Agency. Nylund believes the disease situation will calm down when winter comes when mosquitoes are not spreading the virus.

In 2016, the wild rabbit population almost collapsed due to rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus. The virus and the intensification and collapse of the rabbit population follow one another. There is also a vaccine for pet rabbits against it.

Laura Pulli, an animal keeper in Korkeasaari, does not believe that the entire wild rabbit population will die of myxomatosis. "There are always strong ones in a population who survive. In addition, wild rabbits are growing at such a rapid rate that the population recovers from the collapse in a few years."

[Myxomatosis is a viral disease commonly observed in European wild rabbits (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_). Where a high prevalence exists among rabbits, hares can also become infected by myxoma virus. The virus is a natural pathogen of the South American rabbit (_Sylvilagus brasiliensis_), where it causes a relatively localized fibroma. The myxoma virus is an example of a virus that has jumped to other species to produce an exotic disease and then coevolved with its new host. Hares (_Lepus_ spp.) are in the same family as rabbits (Leporidae) and can be infected by myxoma virus. The virus is transmitted via blood-feeding arthropods or by close contact between hares and infected rabbits or their excretions. In hares, myxomatosis follows a prolonged course with multiple firm subcutaneous nodular masses at the head, back, and limbs. - Mod.PMB
