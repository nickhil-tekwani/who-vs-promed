[According to the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs' (DEFRA) and Animal and Plant Health Agency's (APHA) "Guidance on Avian Influenza (Bird Flu)": "A case of H7N7 avian flu was confirmed near Preston, Lancashire on 13 Jul 2015. A 10 km [6 mi] surveillance zone and an inner 3 km [2 mi] protection zone have been imposed.

Within these zones a range of controls is in place to prevent the spread of disease. These include restrictions on the movement of poultry, carcasses, eggs, used poultry litter, and manure. There are also restrictions on bird gatherings (fairs, shows, exhibitions) and the release of game birds. The humane culling of all birds at the farm has been completed."
