Plant viruses are the bane of every farmer. Marcia Roye, University of the West Indies, said that over a 20 year period, researchers have found more than 22 plant viruses [in Jamaica], some of which have not been characterised as yet.

"In the red peas, [we found] bean golden yellow mosaic virus," Roye said. "If the plant gets infected before it flowers, you won't get any crop. Broad beans are also infected by the same virus." She stated that all the red beans and peas used in Jamaica are imported because the virus hinders local productivity.

"There's a virus we found in a particular legume called tobacco yellow crinkle virus, and it infects tobacco in Cuba. But we haven't found it in tobacco in Jamaica, so we don't really know if it came from Cuba," Roye argued. "There's the tomato yellow leaf curl virus," she said. "In the 1980s, they were going to grow vegetables for the winter market in the US. Instead of importing the seed from Israel, they imported seedlings. We think that with the seedlings, the virus also came in from the Middle East." This virus is the most destructive to have affected the tomato crop and also affects scotch bonnet peppers.

Tomatoes are also affected by the tomato dwarf leaf virus, which results in stunted growth of tomatoes, leading to a small amount of fruit to be produced or none at all. This virus is native to Jamaica and also affects scotch bonnet peppers.

In the case of cabbages, there is the cabbage leaf curl virus, also found in Florida, and the cabbage leaf curl Jamaica virus, which is native to the island. "Two viruses formed the cabbage leaf curl Jamaica virus, a virus from weeds combined with the one from the crop. In the lab, it can infect [also] scotch bonnet pepper and tomato, but we don't find that in the field. But you don't know if it's going to change over time to be able to infect these crops," she continued.

Roye explained that farmers can grow tomatoes that will resist the tomato yellow leaf curl virus. In the case of scotch bonnet pepper, no resistant variety has been identified as yet. She also advised farmers that their crop is infected through the white flies, and so they should spray their plants. "But you have to use several different sprays to make sure they don't develop resistance over time," Roye implored.

[All viruses mentioned above are members of genus _Begomovirus_ (Geminiviridae; type member _Bean golden yellow mosaic virus_). Begomoviruses are transmitted by different whitefly vectors (which are a serious pest in themselves) and many can also be transmitted by mechanical means and grafting, but they are not seed transmitted. Begomovirus control is particularly difficult in open field crops due to the widespread presence and wide host range of whiteflies. Disease management may include pathogen exclusion, vector control and elimination of possible pathogen and/or vector reservoir plants. In some cases, crop cultivars with increased virus resistance are available.

In Jamaica, since the 1990s, the production of several vegetable crops has been severely impacted by begomoviruses. Numerous weeds have been identified as virus reservoirs, and it has been suggested that some of the crop viruses may have been derived from these.

"Scotch bonnet" is a variety of chili (_Capsicum_) widely grown in the Caribbean.
