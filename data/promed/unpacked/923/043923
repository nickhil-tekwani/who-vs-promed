New Hampshire: First Human Case of West Nile Virus Infection (Imported)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services' Office of
Community and Public Health reports the first positive case of West Nile
virus infection in a New Hampshire resident. The 37-year-old woman from
Rockingham County traveled to Nebraska prior to becoming ill. She did not
require hospitalization and is now recovering and doing well. "Because of
her travel history there is a high probability of this case being acquired
outside of New Hampshire; but even if it was a locally acquired case, this
would not be an unexpected event," said Dr. Jose Montero, Chief of the
Bureau of Communicable Disease Control. "West Nile virus has been in our
state for 3 years now. It was inevitable that someone would eventually be
bitten by an infected mosquito and contract the disease. Fortunately,
prevention efforts taken by towns, residents, and our state health
department over the past few years have contributed greatly to lowering the
risk of people getting West Nile virus infection."
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta now considers
West Nile virus to be a permanent part of the environment in the United
States. It first arrived in New York City in 1999 and has steadily spread
westward to 44 states in 2002. This season so far 44 states have documented
the presence of West Nile virus. West Nile was first isolated in 1937 and
has been known to occur in West Asia, Africa, and the Middle East as well
as the United States. "While there is no cause for panic, it is important
for people to continue to be vigilant," says Dr. Montero. "People can help
stop the spread of West Nile virus by getting rid of mosquito breeding
areas found on their property. We're asking everyone to check for discarded
tires, clogged gutters, and other sources of standing water, and to take
steps to eliminate them."
