A fungus usually found in the tropics has taken root in the Pacific
Northwest and has been blamed in the deaths of 15 people over the
last 6 years, health officials said Thursday [22 Jul 2010]. At least
60 people have been sickened in 4 states by the fungus, _Cryptococcus
gattii_, which grows on or around trees. Illness occurs months after
people breathe in its microscopic spores, and [patients] can be
treated with anti-fungal medications.

While still considered rare in North America, health officials say
they want doctors to know to look for it and patients to be aware of
it. The overall risk to the public is very low, and there's no need
for people to avoid going outdoors and exercising, said Julie Harris,
an epidemiologist with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC).

The fungal illness began to show up in British Columbia, Canada, in
1999, and may have spread southward, although at least one different
strain has been found in the United States. Scientists don't know why
the tropical illness has appeared in the Northwest but not in other
northern locations.

Since 2004, there have been 43 cases in Oregon, 15 in Washington, one
in California and one in Idaho, the CDC said Thursday. Of those 60
cases, the outcome is known in 45, and 15 ended in death. The fungus
caused 9 of the deaths, and was believed to be a factor in the other
6, officials reported. Symptoms include a persistent cough, headache
and shortness of breath. Some cases have worsened into a pneumonia-
or meningitis-like illnesses.

British Columbia has counted 272 cases since the 1st cases were
detected, said Dr. Eleni Galanis, an epidemiologist with the British
Columbia Centre for Disease Control. Canadian officials don't have an
up-to-date count of deaths, but an earlier analysis suggested a death
rate of about 9 percent.

The proportion of U.S. and Canadian cases ending in death may sound
alarmingly high, but it's likely others have been infected but
weren't diagnosed because they didn't develop serious illness, Harris
said. Also, most of those who got sick had another condition that
likely made them more susceptible to the fungal illness.

People are not the only victims. More than 50 cases in animals have
been reported in the United States, including cats, dogs, ferrets,
elk and porpoises.

_Cryptococcus gattii_ is an emerging infection in the United States.
_C. gattii_ appears to differ from its sibling species, _C.
neoformans_, both in its clinical aspects (e.g., less responsive to
antifungal drugs and more likely to cause tumor-like lesions called
cryptococcomas) and its ecologic niche. In addition, whereas the
primary risk factor for _C. neoformans_ cryptococcosis is severe
immunosuppression (e.g., from HIV infection), risk factors for _C.
gattii_ infection in the United States appear to include both
immunocompromised and exposure to specific regions of environmental
fungal colonization.

Many cases of _C. gattii_ infection are likely not recognized because
distinguishing between _C. gattii_ and _C. neoformans_ requires
plating on differential media not routinely available in clinical
microbiology laboratories; therefore, many cryptococcal infections
are never speciated. In addition, cryptococcal infections generally
are not notifiable diseases in the United States, although _C.
gattii_ is now reportable in one state, Washington, as a rare disease
of public health importance.

Until 1999, most human _C. gattii_ infections were reported from
Australia and other tropical and subtropical regions, including parts
of Africa, Asia, the Mediterranean, South America, and southern
California. Fungal spores are known to colonize the nasal cavity and
spread to other body sites, causing meningitis, pneumonia, and the
development of lung, brain, or muscle cryptococcomas. The infection
is not known to be transmitted among or within animal species.
Although _C. gattii_ had been isolated rarely from environmental
sources and patients in the United States before 2004, U.S. outbreaks
had not been reported.

Because _C. gattii_ typically has been regarded as tropical or
subtropical in geographic distribution, its emergence in a temperate
climate suggests that the pathogen might have adapted to a new
climatic niche, or that climatic warming might have created an
environment in which minimum threshold conditions for _C. gattii_
spore survival and propagation are attained consistently.
Alternatively, the environmental conditions supportive of _C. gattii_
might be broader than previously suspected, or earlier propagation
might have been inhibited by low concentrations of pathogen in the
environment.

In addition, infections might have occurred in the Pacific Northwest
before the recognized increase in human cases, but too rarely to
attract attention. However, retrospective speciation of 49
cryptococcal isolates from the Pacific Northwest obtained from 1997
through 2003 and 31 isolates from Vancouver Island obtained from 1987
through 1998 revealed exclusively _C. neoformans_, suggesting that
the recent increase in reports of _C. gattii_ represent actual
emergence of the species in the region and not just an increase in
disease awareness and reporting.

Additional systematic surveillance is needed to track _C. gattii_
infection, along with increased awareness of the infection among
public health practitioners, physicians, and veterinarians. In 2010,
for the 1st time, surveillance data for _C. gattii_ were reported at
the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists meeting. The _C.
gattii_ Public Health Working Group is continuing disease
surveillance and planning to conduct speciation of banked isolates of
_Cryptococcus_. Improved surveillance should enable better assessment
of the incidence of the disease and also its clinical manifestation
and course.

Physicians should consider _C. gattii_ as a possible etiology of
infection when treating patients (particularly those who are HIV
negative) who have signs and symptoms of cryptococcal infection, and
should ask patients about recent travel to the Pacific Northwest,
British Columbia, or other _C. gattii_--endemic areas. Physicians,
particularly in the Pacific Northwest, should report suspected _C.
gattii_ infections and submit clinical isolates to their state health
departments when requested.

[The following is extracted from my comments in ProMED-mail post
Cryptococcus gattii, human, animal - Canada, USA 20100426.1341:

"_C. gattii_ is endemic in eucalyptus-growing regions of Australia
and Papua New Guinea (the bark and leaves are apparently an
ecological habitat for _C. gattii_), and in parts of Africa, the
Mediterranean region, India, south-east Asia, Mexico, Brazil, and
Paraguay (see
<http://www.mycology.adelaide.edu.au/Fungal_Descriptions/Yeasts/Cryptococcus/C_gattii.html>).
Its occurrence in latter regions lacking eucalyptus trees suggests
that additional environmental niches for this fungus are yet to be
discovered.

"Unlike cryptococcal infections among immunodeficient individuals
(such as patients with AIDS/HIV or organ transplant recipients),
which are predominantly caused by _Cryptococcus neoformans_, 70-80
percent of cryptococcal infections among immunocompetent hosts are
caused by _C. gattii_; _C. gattii_ infections are mainly pulmonary
(75 percent), although neurologic (8 percent) and combined (9
percent) infections are seen. The outbreak strains in the Pacific
Northwest are particularly virulent and associated with high
mortality.

"_C. gattii_ has caused a large-scale outbreak since 1999 that
involves terrestrial and marine mammals and several hundred humans in
British Columbia and the Pacific Northwestern US. The route by which
_C. gattii_ was introduced into North America has not been
established, although importation of contaminated eucalyptus trees or
seeds, or wooden pallets or crates made from eucalyptus that are not
routinely inspected for microbial contamination upon entry into
Canada or the US has been implicated, with subsequent spread possibly
by human and other animal activity (Kidd SE, Bach PJ, Hingston, AO,
Mak S, et al: _Cryptococcus gattii_ dispersal mechanisms, British
Columbia, Canada. Emerg Infect Dis. 2007 Jan 13(1): 51-7; available
from
<http://www.cdc.gov./ncidod/eid/13/1/51.htm>). For a further
discussion of possible mechanisms of dispersal, please see the prior
