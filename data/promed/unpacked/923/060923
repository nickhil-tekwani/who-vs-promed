----------------------------------------------------------------------
One rubella vaccination campaign, targeting all above 15 [years of age] who have not had rubella-containing vaccine earlier or have not had a physician confirmed episode of rubella should halt the epidemic within 2 weeks. Although pregnancy is stated as contraindication, if inadvertently given to a woman with even early pregnancy, the vaccine is safe and no fetal problems should occur (based on earlier reviews and assessment of the WHO Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety). So a pulse campaign is quite safe and feasible. Stand-alone rubella vaccine is available from vaccine manufacturers.

This is so simple a solution that the Japanese might have considered and opted not to: for what reasons?
