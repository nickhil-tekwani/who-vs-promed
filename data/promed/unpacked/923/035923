Ministry of Health, Republic of South Sudan is concerned of the ongoing cholera situation in Juba, and it's formally declaring cholera outbreak in Juba, Central Equatoria State. To date [15 May 2014], 18 suspected cholera cases have been reported in Juba with one death, one of whom was laboratory confirmed on 6 May 2014, following tests conducted by the AMREF laboratory in Nairobi. The 18 suspected cases reported so far originate from Gudelle 2, Gudelle 1, Juba Nabari, Jopa, Kator, Gabat, Mauna, Newsite, MTC, Nyakuron, and Munuki block A. There are 14 suspected cases currently admitted at the isolation ward in Juba Teaching Hospital, 6 males and 8 females, and one case at IBI clinic in Gudelle. The 1st index case did not seek treatment and has reportedly improved, while the 2 contacts of the confirmed case are well and have not developed any symptoms and signs.

The Ministry of Health and WHO have taken steps to conduct comprehensive investigations and are currently on the ground following up all the contacts of the cases. The Ministry of Health is aware of the appalling conditions of the IDPs [internally displaced persons] in the camps; namely overcrowding, poor hygiene and sanitation favorable for a potential cholera outbreak; however, the Ministry is working with health and WASH cluster partners on the ground to ensure that the risk of the outbreak spreading is minimized.

The Ministry of Health with the support of WHO, UNICEF, MSF, IOM and Medair have conducted cholera vaccination campaigns in Mingkaman, Malakal, Bor, Tomping and Juba III in an effort to prevent a possible cholera outbreak among the IDPs. However, a lot of interventions still need to be put in place such as water and sanitation to ensure that outbreak is promptly contained.

Over 80 000 people have been fully vaccinated against cholera with 2 doses in IDP camps. With more coverage expected in Bor where the 1st round has already happened, and plans are in place to conduct the OCV [oral cholera vaccination] campaign in Bentiu. It's important to note that the confirmed case had only received one dose of the cholera vaccine.

[This could be the beginning of a major outbreak of cholera given the overall conditions in the area. It would be useful to see if the previous mass immunization with a cholera vaccine could have blunted the impact of cholera in this population. - Mod.LL
