----------------------------------------------------------------------
On [3 Jun 2014], the National IHR Focal Point of Saudi Arabia reported 113 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), including 34 deaths. These cases and deaths were identified through retrospective review of hospital records, dating between 5 May 2013 and 6 May 2014.

The majority of the cases (84) occurred after [1 Mar 2014]; and the rest of cases (29) occurred between 5 May 2013 and [28 Feb 2014].

The 113 cases are residents of the following regions: 49 from Mecca (including 44 from the city of Jeddah, 2 from the city of Mecca, 2 from Taif and 1 from Shamyah), 47 from Riyadh (including 21 from the city of Riyadh, 12 from Kharj, 9 from Delam, 2 from Wadi Addawaseer, 2 from Aflaj and 1 from Hanakia ), 9 from Medina (including 8 from the city Medina and 1 from Yanbu), 4 cases from Ash Sharqiyah (including 2 from the city of Hassa, 1 from Dammam and 1 from Hafr Al Batin) 2 from Asir (including 1 from the city of Khamis Mshet and 1 from Bisha), 1 case from Tabuk (Tabuk city) and 1 case from Jawf (Jawf city).

Of the 113 cases, 69 are Saudi nationals, while 44 are non-Saudi nationals.

The median age of the cases is 41 years (ranging from 3 months to 89 years) and 57 percent (64) are males.

Information on the symptoms was reported for 111 of the 113 cases. Of these, 32 cases had no symptoms of illness (asymptomatic), while 79 were reported to have symptoms. Of the cases with symptoms, 70 were reported to have been hospitalized. No information was provided on existing underlying medical conditions.

Information on the final outcome was provided for 113 cases as follows: 76 recovered, 3 were still hospitalized and 34 died.

Information on possible source of infection was reported for 72 out of the 113 cases. Of these 18 cases acquired infection from a non-human source at the community level and 54 cases acquired infection from another person. Of the infections acquired from another person: health care acquired infection was reported for 41 cases and household infection was reported for 13 cases.

37 percent (42 out of 113 cases) are health care workers. Among these, 19 were reported as asymptomatic and 23 were reported to have symptoms. Information on the severity of these symptoms was not reported. The final outcome for the health care workers was provided as follow: 39 recovered, 1 still hospitalized and 2 died.

The characteristics of the 113 cases are similar to those previously reported. The pattern and dynamic of the epidemic and the risk assessment remain unchanged.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -- update 25 Jun 2014
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
On [17 Jun 2014], the National IHR Focal Point of Saudi Arabia notified WHO of 2 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

Details of the cases:
- A 42-year-old resident of Jeddah city, Mecca Region. He was admitted to a hospital in Jeddah for a medical condition on [26 May 2014] and was discharged on [4 Jun 2014]. The patient visited his physician as follow up in the same hospital on [11 Jun 2014]. On [13 Jun 2014], he developed respiratory symptoms, was diagnosed with pneumonia and was re-admitted to the hospital. He was laboratory-confirmed with MERS-CoV on [16 Jun 2014]. His condition deteriorated and he died on [18 Jun 2014]. The patient is reported not to have had contact with a laboratory-confirmed case with MERS-CoV. He neither had a history of recent travel nor a history of contact with animals. Preliminary investigations indicate that none of the personnel working in the ward where the patient was initially admitted had illnesses that fit the case definition for MERS-CoV.

- A 58-year-old resident of Riyadh city, Riyadh Region. He became ill on [4 Jun 2014] and was admitted to a hospital on [12 Jun 2014]. He was laboratory-confirmed with MERS-CoV on [15 Jun 2014]. The patient is currently in a stable condition. He travelled to Mecca, Jeddah City, to perform Umrah on [31 May 2014] and travelled from there to Egypt on [3 Jun 2014]. He returned from Egypt to Riyadh on [9 Jun 2014]. The patient is reported not to have had contact with a previously laboratory-confirmed case with MERS-CoV and is reported not to have had contact with animals. The patient is reported not to have any underlying medical condition.

Further investigations and follow up of contacts are ongoing.

Globally, 703 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 250 related deaths, have officially been reported to WHO.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp

[Since the last ProMED-mail update on 19 Jun 2014, there have been a total of 5 new laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection in Saudi Arabia and 2 deaths. None of these 5 new cases were in healthcare workers, all were symptomatic with one admitted to the ICU and the remaining 4 admitted to the hospital ward. Both deaths occurred in individuals with a history of pre-existing co-morbidities. In total, to date, there have been 710 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by Saudi Arabia, including 292 deaths (case fatality rate of 41.1 percent). With today's [26 Jun 2014], the WHO global tally of MERS-CoV infections is now 820 laboratory-confirmed cases, including at least 286 related deaths (case fatality rate of 35.6 percent). As a reminder, on 3 Jun 2014, Saudi Arabia revised its case count, adding an additional 113 cases, including 92 additional deaths. The above WHO report confirms the 113 cases and 34 deaths. This moderator remains confused as to the classification of the additional 58 deaths reported by the Saudi MOH on 3 Jun 2014 not included in the current WHO update. Clarification from knowledgeable sources would be greatly appreciated.

Noteworthy information contained in the WHO update/review of the 113 additional laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infected individuals include: The geographic distribution of the cases is fairly extensive involving individuals from 7 of the 13 provinces in Saudi Arabia (see http://www.saudia-online.com/Map%20of%20proviance.htm for a map of Saudi Arabia showing provinces). 61 percent of the 113 cases involved Saudi Nationals, 39 percent were in expats -- the percentage of expats visiting Saudi Arabia on pilgrimage vs those resident and working in Saudi Arabia would be interesting to know. 29 percent of the 111 cases on whom information was available were asymptomatic vs. 71 percent were symptomatic, of whom 89 percent were hospitalized. In terms of outcome, the case fatality rate among these 113 cases was 30 percent. Of the 72 cases on whom information on possible source of infection was available, 25 percent acquired infection from a non-human source (?camel or raw camel product exposure) and 75 percent acquired the infection from another person. Of the 54 individuals who acquired infection from another person, 76 percent did so in the health care environment and 24 percent did so in the household environment. Overall, 37 percent of these cases occurred in healthcare workers of whom 55 percent had symptomatic infections, while 45 percent had asymptomatic infections.

The month of Ramadan will be beginning next week, on 28 Jun 2014. This is a period when there is an increase in pilgrims to Saudi Arabia and from within Saudi Arabia converging on the Muslim holy sites. As there have been reports of cases of MERS-CoV infection in individuals performing their pilgrimages, one hopes that the messages aimed at reducing currently identified risk factors for transmission of MERS-CoV are heeded, and that there will not be an increase in MERS-CoV transmission during this period.

Maps showing the locations of the newly reported cases, deaths, and recovered individuals can be found at the respective source URLs of the Saudi MOH reports provided above. - Mod.MPP
