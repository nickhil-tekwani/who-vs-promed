[All 4 new BTV-4 outbreaks were reported from the north-eastern county Botosani, bordering with Moldava, and all affected cattle in rather small backyard holdings. It will be interesting to note if these cases were clinical and if there are sheep holdings in their vicinity. BTV-4 is generally known to cause clinical disease in sheep, particularly European breeds, rather than cattle.

While France, currently suffering a new outbreak of BTV-8 -- known to be pathogenic to cattle -- has started a vaccination campaign, Romania does not even mention a consideration to vaccinate cattle against BTV-4. In case there are sheep in the vicinity, their preventive vaccination against BTV-4 deserves to be considered. - Mod.AS
