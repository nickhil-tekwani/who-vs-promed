Dr. Mumtaz Shaheen, director of the Egyptian Animal Health Research Institute [Cairo, Dokki - Giza, Egypt), said that a mobile laboratory equipped with a veterinary and technical team has been installed in Aswan to address the Rift Valley fever [RVF] issue related to the outbreak of the disease in Sudan. [The team] collects samples from different places in Aswan governorate to carry out the tasks entrusted to it, in accordance with recognized standards and controls that determine the methods of sampling to ensure transparency in analysis and verification. From the results of analysis and prompt reporting of these results, appropriate decisions can be made to protect Egypt's livestock.

It was decided to safeguard the exchange of information between public and animal health authorities in order to achieve integration in the performance and implementation of the roles of monitoring and follow-up of any RVF cases appearing either in livestock or passengers coming from Sudan. The awareness and understanding of farmers and breeders dealing positively with the preventive measures are praised; this includes the progress of the RVF vaccination campaign of livestock, required to defend the health of citizens in the Aswan governorate.

Dr. Mona Mehrez, deputy minister of Agriculture [for Animal, Fish and Poultry Resources], has pointed out the importance of coordination with the governorate to carry out pesticide spraying against flies and mosquitoes, in particular addressing ponds, swamps, and barns inside various villages and remote areas and markets, especially in foci and areas where there is livestock. Disinfectants and insecticides should be systematically applied in river transport vessels intended for passengers as well as cargo barges operating between Halfa ports in Sudan and the Aswan High Dam as one of the measures to prevent epidemic diseases, including Rift Valley fever, foot-and-mouth disease, and dengue fever.

[While RVF may cause serious economic losses in susceptible animals, mainly affecting juvenile sheep, goats, and cattle (in order of severity) and -- to a lesser extent -- camels, the prevention of disease is essential to protect public health. The 1st, explosive epidemic in Egypt took place in 1977; official Egyptian government figures on the human disease indicated 18 000 cases and 598 deaths; later estimates mentioned 200 000 human infections. The clinical spectrum in humans included febrile (most cases), encephalitic (about 800 cases), ocular (at least 800 examined), and hemorrhagic (frequently fatal) cases. The losses in animals were severe (on 4 sheep farms studied, 80-100% of the ewes aborted, 8-60% of adult animals died, and mortality in the few lambs present approached 100%). Camels imported to Egypt from Sudan for local slaughter (mainly in the Cairo abattoir) were suggested as one of the major routes of RVF introduction.

Since 1977, Egypt has been affected by RVF in 1981, 1993, 1994, 1997, and, finally, 2003.

A (September 2018) Egyptian paper (Ref. 1) addressed camels specifically, informing that the incidence of RVFV IgG antibodies was 16.7% in Sudan-originating camels entering Egypt from Sudan during an inter-epidemic period. They reported that only 10% of imported animals were tested upon arrival against RVFV antibodies as a routine disease control. It is anticipated that this sampling/testing rate is already being increased, at least for the duration of the continuing event in Sudan.

A useful analysis of the RVF risk posed by camels imported to Egypt from Sudan is to be found in Ref. 2 (January 2018).

According to a new update report, "Rift Valley Fever Sudan" by UN OCHA, published today (Thu 7 Nov 2019), 31 new human cases, including 2 deaths, have been added since 30 Oct 2019 in the 6 affected states in Sudan. The updated summary follows:
The total number of human RVF cases, since the onset of the disease on 28 Sep 2019 until 4 Nov 2019, is 279, including 9 deaths. The cases have been reported from the following 6 states: Red Sea (112), River Nile (162), Khartoum (1), White Nile (1), Gedaref (1), and Kassala (2). The CFR [case fatality rate] is at 3.2%. https://reports.unocha.org/en/country/sudan/?fbclid=IwAR11YZtKQP7CnRKi8OdKTf02Gz1_vTxjXYdh-FQIih3acTEHu7Uvln_of5g.
