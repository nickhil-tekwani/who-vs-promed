[During the 2008 annual General Session of the Office International des
Epizooties (OIE) in Paris, 25-30 May 2008, the head of the Organisation's
Animal Health Information Department, Dr Karim Ben Jebara, presented the
traditional annual report addressing the evolution of the most prominent
transboundary animal diseases since the beginning of the previous year. The
following chapter on HPAI H5N1 has been derived from his report. - Mod.AS]

Highly pathogenic avian influenza
----------------------------------
Between 2003 and early 2008, a total of 61 countries/territories reported
the occurrence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus subtype H5N1.

Some historical background information on this disease: in late 2003 and in
2004 the disease was restricted to South East Asia and in 2005 spread to
Central Asia, Russia, and Eastern Europe. In 2006, it reached the African
continent and the Middle East for the first time and spread to Western
Europe, where mainly wild birds were infected. In 2006, a total of 47
countries/territories notified the OIE of the presence of the disease.

In 2008 (up to the end of May), 12 countries/territories had notified the
reoccurrence of HPAI H5N1 following its previous eradication, thus
indicating that the virus is continuing to circulate. These are the
Republic of Korea, Hong Kong (SARPRC), India, Iran, Israel, Japan, Laos,
Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom (wild birds).

In 2007, 29 countries (4 in Africa, 14 in Asia, 3 in the Middle East, and 8
in Europe) reported HPAI subtype H5N1 in poultry, in wild birds, or in both
poultry and wild birds. For Bangladesh, Benin, Ghana, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia,
and Togo these were the 1st ever reports of the disease.

In 2007, the number of countries that reported outbreaks was smaller (29
countries)[see table 1] than in 2006, when 47 countries were affected.
Starting in 2007, the trend has been for a decline in both the number of
affected countries and the number of notified outbreaks. Benin, Germany,
Israel, Myanmar, Nigeria, Poland, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Togo, and the
United Kingdom submitted a final report indicating the resolution of the
outbreaks of HPAI H5N1 and the absence of any new outbreaks. Germany,
Israel, Myanmar, Poland, Romania and Saudi Arabia declared themselves free
from HPAI in poultry.

Table 1. Countries that notified HPAI subtype H5N1 in domestic poultry
and/or only in wild birds in 2007:
Afghanistan, Bangladesh*, Benin*, Cambodia, China (People's Rep of), Czech
Republic, Egypt, France (wild birds), Germany, Ghana*, Hong Kong (SARPRC)
(wild bird), Hungary, India, Japan, Korea (Republic of), Kuwait*, Laos,
Malaysia, Myanmar, Pakistan, Poland, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia*,
Thailand, Togo*, Turkey, United Kingdom (poultry), Viet Nam.
(*) Countries that notified their 1st ever occurrence of the disease

In March 2008, Viet Nam notified the presence of this disease in a new host
species. The affected animals were 6 Owston's palm civets (_Chrotagale
owstoni_) in the Cuc Phuong National Park. The disease had been identified
in civets in 2005 but the OIE was not notified at that time.

Regarding the evolution of the disease, 18 affected countries succeeded in
eradicating the disease in 2007 and 11 countries did so early in 2008.
However, 4 of the 18 countries where HPAI had been eradicated in 2007
notified the reoccurrence of the disease at the beginning of 2008 (see
Table 2). In other countries, such as Indonesia, Egypt, and possibly
certain parts of Vietnam, Bangladesh and the People's Republic of China,
the disease is not under control, despite the vaccination strategy
(excluding Bangladesh) put in place. Nine out of 18 countries that
submitted a final report in 2007 declared themselves free from HPAI H5N1.

Table 2. Countries/Territories that submitted final reports on HPAI H5N1 in
2007 or early 2008:
In 2007: Cote d'Ivoire, Czech Republic, Djibouti, Ghana, Hong-Kong
(SARPRC)*, Hungary, India*, Japan, Korea (Rep of)*, Kuwait, Malaysia,
Myanmar, Romania , Slovenia, Sudan, Thailand, Turkey*, Ukraine*.
In 2008: Benin , Germany, Israel, France, Nigeria, Poland, Romania, Saudi
Arabia, Togo, Turkey, United Kingdom.
(*)Countries/Territories that subsequently notified the reoccurrence of
HPAI H5N1.

This epizootic of HPAI subtype H5N1 is unprecedented since there are no
records of an epizootic having lasted so long a time and having covered
such a wide geographical area in such a short period of time. While it is
important to combat the disease at source, additional efforts are needed in
order to monitor on a more regular basis the efficiency of the vaccines
currently in use, to increase vaccination coverage and to decrease the
interval between vaccinations in countries where the disease is endemic. It
will not be possible to attain these objectives without a very real
international and national commitment to apply effective vaccination, so as
to achieve better control of the disease and ultimately its eradication
once vaccination is no longer used.
