New research suggests Ireland's increasing populations of sika deer may be linked to local outbreaks of bovine TB infection in cattle.

Researchers used county-level population densities, taken between 2000 and 2018, to track the 3 known maintenance hosts of TB in Ireland: cattle, badgers and sika deer. They then considered how variations in local densities compared with the variation in TB infection rates across the country, and also at county level.

Although TB infection rates have decreased in general in recent decades, county-level data showed a correlation between higher sika numbers and higher local TB infections -- with County Wicklow a particular hotspot.

Researchers at Trinity College Dublin and the National Parks and Wildlife Service, who were supported by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM), say the study has major implications for controlling TB. Dr. David Kelly, of Trinity's School of Natural Sciences, said: "Our analyses show that while there have been general reductions in TB infection, there is a correlation between increasing sika deer density and higher local TB infection. This pattern has emerged in recent years.

"Now, when attempting to manage TB in wildlife, sika deer will need to be considered as well as badgers. Our analyses suggest sika deer are currently of greatest concern in County Wicklow, but if numbers continue to rise in other counties they may also pose problems elsewhere."

The Irish Farmers' Association (IFA) said farmers throughout the country were seeing greater levels of deer encroachment on to their lands, introducing disease threats and also damaging crops and fences. "IFA has identified the problems with the lack of a nationally co-ordinated strategy to manage our deer population within its own environment," a spokesman said.

"The National Deer Management Forum set up by government has not functioned for a number of years and must be reconvened as a matter of urgency. Its sole purpose was to address this very issue, and nothing has happened in this area, other than the continual increase in the deer population and further encroachments on to farmlands. IFA continues to highlight the need for a nationally co-ordinated deer management strategy that ensures deer numbers are reduced to levels that can be maintained within their natural habitat."

A DAFM spokesman said: "The renewed TB Strategy published in January 2021 sets out a comprehensive set of actions designed to reduce the transmission of TB to the benefit of Irish farmers and includes a section on deer. The TB Stakeholder Forum supported by its working groups will continue to implement the strategy in support of the farming community. If farmers are concerned that deer may be playing a role in cattle TB, they can arrange for the deer to be culled by hunters and DAFM will test the deer for TB for free through the Regional Veterinary Laboratory network."

[Bovine tuberculosis due to _Mycobacterium bovis_ has one of the widest host ranges of all the _M. tuberculosis_ complex (MTC) and can readily spill over into a variety of domestic and wild mammals, including humans.

In the British Isles, _M. bovis_ found a suitable alternative host in which to thrive, the badger (_Meles meles_). Badgers turned out to be such competent hosts that they are playing an important role in maintaining the pathogen. Sika deer (_Cervus nippon_) emerged as another competent alternative host in Ireland, and these new data underscore their importance.

Sika deer is originally from northeastern Asia and was introduced in Ireland in 1860. Now they have become the most abundant cervid there. For a picture of a stag, go to https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Cervus_nippon_002.jpg.
