[1] France, domestic fowl (turkeys), H5 confirmed
Date: Fri, 24 Feb 2006

France confirmed on Friday [24 Feb 2004] the presence of an H5 bird
flu virus at a farm in the east of the country where thousands of
turkeys had died, and said results of tests for the H5N1 strain were
expected soon.
The outbreak was discovered on Thursday [23 Feb 2006] at the farm with 11 000
turkeys in the department of Ain, where 2 cases of the H5N1 virus have already
been confirmed in 2 wild ducks.
"I know that it is the H5 virus, which is a very pathogenic virus," Farm
Minister Dominique Bussereau told French television, adding test results for
H5N1 were not yet available. "What worries us, and this is why we have
reacted immediately, is that the farm is within the protection zone that we
set up for the first duck," he added.
If confirmed, it would be the 1st case of H5N1 spreading to a farm in
the European Union and could deal a hammer blow to France's already
battered poultry industry, worth 6 billion euros (USD 7 billion) a
year and the biggest in the bloc.
Poultry sales in France are already down around 30 percent.
The deadly virus is highly contagious among poultry and can spread
through an entire flock within hours. It remains very difficult for
humans to catch but has killed more than 90 people worldwide. Experts
say cooked poultry meat remains safe to eat.
The virus has spread from Asia to Africa, and experts fear poultry in
more regions around the world could soon be infected.
"We are seeing a rapid evolution of the situation," OIE Director
General Bernard Vallat said in an interview with French daily Le
Monde.
Local sources said around 80 percent of the turkeys at the French
farm, situated in a region famous for the quality of its chickens,
had died. The remaining birds have been culled.
A security zone of 3 km (2 miles) and a surveillance zone of 7 km (5
miles) had been set up around the farm as is usual under European
Union emergency measures, officials say.
Under EU rules, poultry meat, eggs and products from the zones set up
around a bird flu infection site are blocked from the market, except
for certain products that meet stringent conditions, such as
heat-treated meat. But trade in these products may continue from
other non-affected parts of the country.
French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin has announced an aid
package for the sector worth 52 million euros.
He travelled to Lyon on Friday, where authorities held a bird flu
simulation exercise focused on the potential arrival of infected
people on an aeroplane from a bird flu-hit region.
France has permission from the EU for a limited vaccination programme
in geese and ducks in 3 departments in the west of the country
believed to be at risk from migratory birds. But Bussereau said 2 of
the departments had decided to opt for the confinement of fowl rather
than vaccination.
OIE's Vallat told Le Monde he disagreed with the French and Dutch request
to use vaccination, which he said should only be a last resort where
confinement and slaughter were not possible.
"Not using vaccination allows quicker identification of the emergence
of the disease," he said. "If I had been Director General of Food at
the (French) farm ministry, as was the case a few years ago, I would
have done everything I could to stop such a decision being taken."

The first case of H5N1 bird flu virus has been detected in the
southern Caucasus republic of Georgia, Prime Minister Zurab Nogaideli
said on national television on Friday [24 Feb 2006], according to
reports reaching here (Moscow).
Dead swans [species?!] were tested in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi
on Thursday, and "the presence of the H5N1 virus was confirmed by a
laboratory", Nogaideli said. Samples had been sent to London for
further testing, the prime minister said [Not yet received, according
to the VLA (Weybridge) avian-influenza update of 24 Feb 2006].
The dead swans were found in the village of Adliya, in the Black Sea
coastal region of Adjara. [Map at
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/GG/4/Adlia.html>].
Operations have been ongoing in the Adjara region to prevent the bird
flu from spreading. Preventive measures have also been taken along
the border area with Azerbaijan and Turkey, Nogaideli said.
The discovery of the virus in Georgia follows [discoveries in] neighboring
Russia, Azerbaijan, Iran and Turkey.
Experts from the World Health Organization have gone to Georgia,
Armenia and Azerbaijan to advise local organizations and people on
how to fight and control the disease.

The first case of H5N1 bird flu in southern Germany was confirmed as the virus
spread beyond the north where it was first detected in the country.
A wild duck found at Lake Constance on the border of Germany and
Switzerland was found to have the virus, Germany's main veterinary
laboratory, the Friedrich Loeffler Institute, said Friday.
Further tests were being carried out to establish if it had the
highly pathogenic form of H5N1 which can be fatal to humans.
The first case of H5N1 bird flu was detected in Germany on the Baltic
Sea island of Ruegen in mid-February 2006 and then spread on to the
mainland in the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.
It was confirmed on Friday that the virus had spread to another
northern state after traces [What are traces?!] were discovered in 2
wild ducks in Schleswig-Holstein, the state's agriculture ministry
said. It could not be immediately established if it was the highly
pathogenic form of H5N1.
Schleswig-Holstein borders Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania to the west.
Denmark is situated to the north of the state.
8 nations in the European Union have reported cases of the most
dangerous strain of H5N1. They are Austria, France, Germany, Greece,
Hungary, Italy, Slovakia and Slovenia.

Latest information on avian influenza
--------------------------------------
Many countries discovered HPAI H5N1 virus in their territories over
the past 2 weeks: Austria, Azerbaijan, Denmark, Egypt, France,
Germany, Hungary, India, Italy, Greece, Iran, Iraq, Nigeria and
Slovenia. In addition, Bulgaria and Slovenia declared the presence of
H5. In Romania, the H5N1 virus moved from the Danube Delta area to
the south, and was reported in an area near the border to Serbia and
Bulgaria.
Country situation
Africa
------
Nigeria:
On 6 Feb 2006, an HPAI outbreak was reported in poultry in a
commercial poultry farm in Jaji farm, Lgagi Local Government Area
(LGA), Kaduna-north State. Outbreaks were also confirmed in Kumbotso
LGA, Kano State and Jos-South LGA, Plateau State (samples were sent
to the OFFLU laboratory (IZS-Venezie, Padova, Italy) for
confirmation). Further outbreaks have been confirmed in Bauchi,
Katsina, Zamfara States and Federal capital Territory) by the
National Veterinary Research Laboratory (NVRI) Vom-Nigeria, bringing
the total number of states affected by AI to 7 since the outbreak was
initially reported. The initial outbreak was reported to have started
on 10 Jan 2006. Infection in 3 more areas were reported on 20
February: Bauchi, Katsina and Zamfara States and the Federal Capital
Territory of Abuja. Media reported that the Government would shortly
start paying compensation to farmers whose birds had been
slaughtered, with the sums ranging from 250 naira (1.5 euros) per
chicken to 20 000 naira for every ostrich. The source of outbreak of
the case in Jaji-Kaduna State is still unknown and activities to
trace it are in progress. Birds of affected farms (poultry,
ostriches, and geese) and within a 3-km radius have been culled and
quarantine measures have been implemented in Kaduna metropolitan
district with the support of the police force. The Government
initially imposed restrictions on the movement of live poultry from a
disease-suspected state to other states and also within the suspected
state. This movement ban has now been extended to all 36 states.
Under the emergency preparedness plan, the Government has organised
70 investigative and diagnostic teams. An awareness campaign to
sensitize villagers on biosecurity has been implemented, including
information dissemination by polio vaccination teams of the health
sector and animal health personnel of the Veterinary Services
Department. The outbreak prompted an import ban on Nigerian poultry
and poultry products by neighbouring countries: Cameroon, Central
African Republic, Ghana, Niger, Angola, Cote d'Ivoire, Mali,
Equatorial Giunea, Guinea-Bissau, Gabon and Sao Tome.
[A map showing the infected locations in Nigeria is included in the
