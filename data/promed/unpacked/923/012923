Re: Avian influenza A (H1N7), human, avians - Egypt
-----------------------------------------------
On behalf of the PAHO's Communicable Diseases Unit, we would like to
correct the posting of our EID Weekly Updates: Emerging and Reemerging
Infectious Diseases, Region of the Americas Vol. 2, No. 18-7 May 2004. The
event in Egypt was indeed caused by an Avian Influenza virus A(H10N7) and
not A(H1N7). We apologize for the inconvenience this may have caused.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. Libel for kindly informing us about
the correction in EID Weekly Update Vol. 2, No. 18-7 May 2004, re-titled
"Avian Influenza Virus A (H10N7) Circulating among Humans in Egypt."
The influenza A (H10N7) virus has reportedly been occasionally isolated
from wild and domestic avians in various parts of the world, including
ratites (emu), as well as from mammals (minks). Its pathogenicity is
regarded as being of low magnitude. During 3 described LPAI outbreaks in
turkeys (Minnesota 1979-1980), the clinical signs ranged from severe, with
a mortality rate as high as 31 percent, to sub-clinical (Karunakaran et
al., 1983. Avian Dis. 27(2):357-66).
The replication of A(H10N7) virus in human volunteers seemed to be limited
and without a detectable antibody response; see in Beare & Webster (1991):
Replication of avian influenza viruses in humans. Arch Virol. 119
(1-2):37-42. - Mod.AS]
