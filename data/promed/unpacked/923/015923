[1] USA (California): mumps students

New cases have been identified in a mumps outbreak at the University of San Diego, county health officials reported Mon [14 Mar 2016].

Three more undergraduate students have been diagnosed with mumps after coming in contact with the student who was 1st diagnosed in February [2016]. That student lived in off-campus housing, officials said.

A 5th student who lives on campus was diagnosed just last week.

"For me, when I heard about it, I was kind of scared, but then I didn't really know anyone who had it, and they also offered the vaccination. So I think I'm a going to get that," a USD student told NBC 7.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines a mumps outbreak as 3 or more cases linked by time and place.

A patient suffering from the mumps often has a fever, headache, earache, and inflammation of the salivary glands.

"The complications can be something called encephalitis, inflammation of the brain, meningitis or inflammation of the surrounding of the brain, or orchitis, which is inflammation of the testicles and inflammation of ovaries. And those last 2 can cause infertility," Dr. Eric McDonald of the San Diego County Health Department explained. Coughing, sneezing, kissing or close contact with an infected person can spread the disease.

An outbreak of mumps has also been reported at Harvard University. The CDC has received 250 reports of mumps so far in 2016. The total number of cases reported last year was 1057.

The MMR vaccine is said to be 88-percent effective in preventing the mumps. Free immunizations are being offered to all undergraduate students at the university to keep the outbreak from spreading, the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency said. USD students and staff can call (619) 260-4595 to find out details on 2 vaccination clinics scheduled for this week.

[We have recently been witnessing an upsurge in mumps reports in college students. Since mumps outbreaks most often occur in winter and spring, this is not unexpected. Case reports are still well below the numbers seen in 2015 - 1057, and 2014 - 1223. The usual level, according to CDC, is several hundred cases per year. Generally high vaccination coverage helps limit the size, duration, and spread of mumps outbreaks. Students at post-high school educational institutions, such as college, trade schools, and training programs, who do not have evidence of immunity (protection) against mumps need 2 doses of MMR vaccine, separated by at least 28 days.

New York state health officials are investigating a possible mumps outbreak at SUNY Buffalo. The state Department of Health says the university has identified 2 probable and 4 suspected cases of mumps among its students.

Students are on spring break until 21 Mar 2016. UB officials are reviewing immunization records to identify students who may need to either be vaccinated or excluded from school when classes resume.

Mumps is a highly contagious viral disease characterized by fever, headache and swelling of the salivary glands.

While the mumps vaccine is not 100 percent effective, 2 doses of the vaccine provide the best protection against mumps.
