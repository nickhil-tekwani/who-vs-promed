A second American animal has tested positive for mad cow disease, Agriculture
Department officials said last night. The sample, from a downer cow in Texas
that died last November [2004], was retested earlier this week at the request
of the USDA inspector general's office.
The animal had been deemed disease-free last fall [2004], but when a sample
was subjected to a more precise test, the result [was] a "weak positive,"
according to USDA Secretary Mike Johanns. He said that because of the
differing results from the 2 tests, the sample would be sent next week to the
world's top mad cow lab in Weybridge, England, for a final set of testing.
Johanns said repeatedly last night that the new result did not mean that
people face any greater health risk from eating beef because meat from
the animal did not enter the human food chain, or the beef feed chain.
He also said the result should not have an impact on long and difficult
negotiations underway to resume the exporting U.S. beef to Japan and
Korea, or the re-opening of the Canadian border to live cattle.
But if the positive finding is confirmed in England, the international
reaction against U.S. beef that occurred when a Washington state dairy
cow tested positive in December 2003 could be repeated.
While the first U.S. mad cow case involved an animal born and raised
largely in Canada and then shipped to Washington state, USDA chief
veterinarian John Clifford said last night that the agency had "no
information" that the possible second case was "an imported animal." He
said the Texas animal was a beef cattle and was older but declined to
give any more specifics.
He did not indicate, for instance, whether the animal was born before or after
the USA implemented a ban on feeding animal parts to cows in 1997. Mad cow
infection is only known to spread through the consumption of beef parts that
were fed to some cows in the 1990s, and the 1997 feed ban was designed to keep
mad cow disease from spreading through the U.S. herd. [According to other
reports, the animal was 9 years old, i.e. born before the ban � see [3]
below. � Mod.JW].
The 3 Canadian animals that have tested positive for mad cow
disease, as well as the Washington state animal, were all found to have
been born prior to the feed ban. If an animal born after the feed ban
tests positive, the effectiveness of the ban could be called into
question.
Over the past year, the USDA has tested about 375 000 animals as part of
an enhanced surveillance program and had found only 3 inconclusive
results, Johanns said. Those 3 were each further tested using the
internationally recognized immunohistochemistry, or IHC, method, and all
came out negative.
But the inspector general, an independent arm of the USDA, asked for an
additional test because of some discrepancies in the initial findings.
The office also asked USDA to use the Western blot method of testing,
which many scientists believe is more precise. Johanns said the positive
result was confirmed yesterday and that he held his 9 p.m.
teleconference soon afterward.
Johanns said it was unusual for a sample to test BSE-negative in one
test and positive in another, but that it has happened in Europe.
Although Johanns said the new finding should not affect efforts to
normalize the international beef trade, others may disagree. Japan,
which used to buy more U.S. beef than any other nation, closed its
market to American beef after the first mad cow case and has resisted
strong pressure to reopen it. Japan, where more than 15 cows have tested
positive for mad cow disease, now tests every cow slaughtered. Its
government has asked U.S. producers to do the same, but the U.S.
government has said the universal testing was not necessay.
The USDA has also been trying to lift a U.S. ban on live Canadian cattle
that was imposed after Canada's first BSE case in May 2003. The border
was scheduled to reopen in March [2005], but a federal judge in Billings,
Montana, ordered a temporary halt at the urging of beef ranchers and
producers who argued the Canadian BSE-prevention system was inadequate.
An appeal on that decision is scheduled for next month, and a full trial
it scheduled for late in July [2005].

The discovery that a second U.S. animal may have mad cow disease could alarm
countries considering lifting a ban on American beef, but the age of the
suspect animal shows U.S. safeguards are working, meat industry sources said.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced an older cow tested
positive for the deadly ailment, but will undergo another round of tests
in Britain to confirm the results.
Beef shipments [to Japan] were cut off in December 2003 following the U.S.
announcement of its first case of the bovine disease. Before its ban,
Japan was the No. 1 beef market for the United States, buying $1.4
billion annually. South Korea was its 3rd-largest market.
The Japanese government agreed in principle in October to resume beef
imports from American cattle aged 20 months or younger, but insisted
shipments would not resume until its independent commission declared
U.S. beef was safe to eat. Current negotiations with South Korea center on
beef from animals under 30 months. Scientists believe mad cow disease takes
several years to incubate within an animal's nervous system, making young
cattle far less risky.
Richard Fritz, vice president of the U.S. Meat Export Federation, said the
news should not slow trade negotiations. "This appears to be a very old
animal," Fritz told Reuters. "I think all of our trading partners understand
the science of the disease and the mitigating measures we put in place. "If it
turns out to be positive, the trading partners will understand why. And if it
turns out negative, it just shows that we have been very diligent and vigilant
in trying to assure the disease is not in the United States," Fritz said.
In 1997, the United States and Canada outlawed the use of cattle remains
as a protein supplement for cattle, goats and sheep to prevent the
spread of mad cow disease.
Canada found 2 cases of mad cow disease earlier this year and both are
thought to be from infected feed. Until now, the United States had found
only one case of mad cow disease, in a Washington state dairy cow
imported from Canada.
The U.S. border has been closed to imports of Canadian cattle since May 2003,
when Canada found its first domestic case of mad cow. The USDA's plan to open
it was halted by a judge at the request of ranchers group R-CALF USA, which
argued that the border should remain closed to protect the public. R-CALF's
lawsuit is backed by more than 60 consumer, food safety and other
groups. "This is exactly why R-CALF has taken a stand on BSE," spokeswoman
Shae Dodson said. "The disease itself is not native to the U.S. cattle herd.
That disease would have had to have been imported into the U.S."
Japanese consumer groups have lobbied against resuming U.S. beef imports,
saying safety cannot be guaranteed. Terry Stokes, chief executive of the
National Cattlemen's Beef Association, said: "It was an older animal and the
product for trade which we are negotiating with Japan and South Korea is from
younger animals."

An American beef cow has tested positive for mad cow
disease and additional tests will have to be done at a
British laboratory to confirm the results, Agriculture
Secretary Mike Johanns said yesterday.
The meat of the animal that tested positive did not get
into the nation's food or animal feed chain, Mr. Johanns
said. "There is no risk whatsoever," he told reporters in
a hastily organized conference call Friday night.
If the British lab confirms the positive test result, it
would be the nation's 2nd confirmed case of mad cow
disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy. The first
confirmed case was found in December 2003 in Washington
State in a dairy cow that had been fed [reared] in Canada.
A confirmed case of the disease would be a blow for the
Agriculture Department, which has been struggling to
reopen the border to live cattle from Canada and win back
export markets in Japan and Korea. After the discovery in
2003, 53 countries banned American cattle. Since then,
about one-third of exports have resumed. But Japan, which
accounted for nearly half of the nation's beef exports
before 2003, has not lifted its ban, despite agreeing to
do so last fall.
Beef has soared to record prices in American grocery
stores, and meatpackers have struggled from the lack of
Canadian cattle they normally count on.
The positive test result came one day after Mr. Johanns
held a roundtable discussion in Minneapolis with beef
cattle producers and other beef officials. There, he
pressed the message that the American beef supply was safe
and that the border closure was wreaking economic havoc on
the $7.5 billion American beef and cattle industry. The
industry has lost more than $4 billion a year since the
case of disease was discovered.
After the discovery in Washington, cattle prices in the
United States fell by about 16 percent, and consumer
surveys at the time suggested that domestic beef demand
could fall by as much as 15 percent. But prices recovered
in early 2004 and American demand for beef has been
robust, contributing to record high prices this spring.
The border with Canada has been closed since May 2003,
when the disease was discovered in a cow in Alberta. Since
then two other confirmed cases have been found in Canada,
and more testing procedures have been put in place there.
The Agriculture Department tried to reopen the border in March to animals that
were 30 months or younger, but was stopped after a cattlemen's group suing to
keep out Canadian imports won an injunction from a federal judge in Montana. A
federal appeals court in San Francisco is scheduled to hold a hearing on the
injunction on 13 Jul 2005, and a trial is set for 27 Jul 2005 in Judge
Cebull's courtroom.
The beef cow, which was 9 years old and could not stand, was first tested last
November [2004] and passed 3 initial tests. Then the Agriculture Department's
inspector general, in reviewing the department's mad cow testing program,
requested that the cow and 2 other previously suspect animals be tested again
with a different technology that is used in Europe. The one cow tested
positive on Friday. Agriculture Department officials said they did not yet
know which state the cow came from. [Another report says Texas � see [1]
above. � Mod.JW]
A sample of the animal's brain tissue will be sent to a laboratory in
Weybridge, England, and results should be available in a few days, a spokesman
said.
