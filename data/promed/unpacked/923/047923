Purple top of potatoes is an emerging disease worldwide and has been reported in Ecuador recently. The disease is very difficult to control and causes significant economic losses to growers, due to severe damage to tubers, reduced yield, or even total crop loss.

Vice Minister of Agriculture, Byron Flores, said, "This disease has already been present for some years in other countries and growers have had to learn to live with it." He reported that the Ministry, to help solve the problem, is providing experienced technicians and training for producers.

To prevent purple top, it is recommended to use certified clean seed tubers, monitor vector insects using yellow traps, eliminate sources of infection, implement crop rotation and, once the disease is detected in a crop, use insecticides to prevent further spread by infectious insects.

[Phytoplasmas of the stolbur (16SrXII), aster yellows (16SrI), and clover proliferation (16SrVI) taxonomic groups have been reported to cause a number of potato diseases, including big bud, purple top, and purple top wilt. Different phytoplasmas within these groups have been found in different regions to cause similar symptoms. It is not clear, which particular phytoplasma the report above refers to, members of both stolbur and aster yellows groups are known to affect other crops in the region (see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives).

Other phytoplasma diseases of potato include witches' broom, marginal flavescence, purple toproll, and phyllody. Further work is needed on taxonomy and relatedness of some of the potato phytoplasmas. Many of the potato phytoplasmas can also affect other solanaceous crops, for example tomato.

Phytoplasmas can be spread with infected plant material (tissue cultures, grafting) and planthopper vectors. Transmission with potato tubers has also been shown, at least in some varieties. Disease outbreaks seem to occur in cycles, being favoured by hot dry summers, which stimulate vector migration into crops. Disease management for phytoplasmas may include vector control, removal of pathogen and/or vector reservoirs (volunteer crop plants, weeds), use of clean planting material and resistant varieties. - Mod.DHA]
