Avoparcin is a glycopeptide antibiotic of the vancomycin family that is
used as a growth-promoting additive in animal feed. Because the mechanism
of action is essentially the same as that of vancomycin, van der Bogaard,
Jensen and Stobberingh have examined the relationship between the emergence
of vancomycin resistance among _Enterococcus sp._ in the intestinal flora
of turkeys and the frequency of gut colonization of turkey farmers and
turkey slaughterers. Healthy persons living in the same area were used as
controls.
Fecal samples were collected from turkeys of 47 farms, the frequency of
isolation of vancomycin-resistant enterococci compared to gut colonization
rates for farmers and slaughters working in the industry, as well as for
the control subjects. Forty-seven farmers, 48 slaughterers, and 188
controls were examined. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci were isolated
from 50% samples derived from turkeys, 39% of turkey farmers, 20% of turkey
slaughterers, and 14% of healthy controls. Turkeys from farms not using
avoparcin as a growth promoter showed a prevalence of 8% colonization with
vancomycin-resistant enterococci as compared to 60% of in flocks fed the
supplement, (p < .001). Almost all of the isolates were _E. faecium_, and
they exhibited minimal inhibitory concentrations of >64 mg/l (highly
resistant). Most high level resistance is coded by genes that circulate as
part of a transposon sequence.

[Infection control personnel and practicing physicians at many institutions
have initiated coordinated efforts to reserve vancomycin therapy for
life-threatening infections caused by enterococcal and staphylococcal
strains that are resistant to beta lactam antibiotics. There is concern
that Gram (+) bacteria that carry the genes for beta lactamase and other
antibiotic resistance genes may become un treatable if
vancomycin-resistance becomes widespread. The use of antibiotics that bind
to the same target as does vancomycin (the acyl-D-alanine-D-alanine portion
of the peptidoglycan cross link) as supplements in animal feeds seems
unwise as it relates to management of serious bacterial infections of
humans. I would be interested to hear from those who work in agriculture
or the pharmaceutical industry who view the situation differently. - Mod.ES
