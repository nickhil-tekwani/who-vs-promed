1. On Thursday [12 May 2011], a suspicion of FMD in the village of
Sarona, Lower Galilee was reported. The suspected cases were seen in a
sheep and goat farm and from a cattle fattening unit.

2. FMD virus has been isolated today [15 May 2011] from samples sent
to the national FMD laboratory, department of virology, Kimron
Veterinary Institute at Beit-Dagan. The virus has not yet been
serotyped.

3. A zone with a radius of 10 km [6 mi] around the outbreak has been
declared infected; see map at
http://www.vetserv.moag.gov.il/NR/rdonlyres/AC31DC7E-20C4-4B1A-9BCA-D097BDF9F6F6/0/mapa_shrona.jpg.

[The map includes the 3-km (2 mile; blue) and 10-km zone (black)
circles around the focus].

4. All permits for transportation of cattle, sheep, and goats, issued
prior to the said declaration for farms within the 10-km zone are
void.

5. In entrances to all farms within the 10-km zone, disinfection
drive-through pools for vehicle wheels should be activated.

[The circular includes additional information and guidelines such as
surveillance activities, revaccinations, special arrangements for
slaughter within the region, etc. - Mod.AS]

[The location of Sarona (Sharona, Saronah) can be seen in maps at
http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IS/03/Sharona.html and
http://healthmap.org/r/0QzH. Similar to the previous 4 outbreaks in
Israel since March 2011, Sarona is located in Hazafon (North)
province. The affected unit is less than 3 km from the earlier
outbreak in Yavneel (see 20110430.1344); Yavneel is located 8 km from
the Jordanian border.

We have been informed that the previous recent outbreak, in
Tuba-Zangariya (see 20110514.1473), involved fattening cattle and that
the virus from that outbreak has been serotyped as FMDV-O, similar to
all outbreaks in Israel since March 2011.

The outbreaks are located in close proximity to wild boar
populations; hopefully, surveillance in these populations have been
undertaken.

It may be assumed that the same virus has been circulating for some
time in neighbouring Jordan, Lebanon and Syria; could this be subject
to investigation/verification/reporting? - Mod.AS]
