Chinese researchers today reported a case of coinfection with H3N2 and H7N9 influenza in a 15 year old boy from Jiangsu province who was sick in late April [2013] and quickly recovered. The team published a case report on their findings in today's issue of The Lancet. The previously healthy student started having symptoms on 25 Apr [2013] and went to the hospital the next day when they worsened. There, 2 throat swabs were taken, and rapid testing showed influenza A. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing in Nanjing indicated influenza A, H7, and H3. Virus isolation yielded H7N9 and H3N2 viruses. The H7N9 virus was highly similar to a Zhejiang strain, and the H3N2 virus was closely related to currently circulating seasonal H3N2 viruses, according to the report. The boy was admitted to the hospital where he received oseltamivir (Tamiflu) treatment. He recovered on 2 May [2013]. Researchers wrote that dual infections are a potential source of reassortment between human and avian viral strains, which could raise the risk of human-to-human transmission.

[In February 2013, a novel avian influenza A H7N9 virus emerged in east China and quickly spread to other areas. By 27 May 2013, 130 human infections had been confirmed, with 37 deaths. Transmission of the H7N9 virus is believed to occur through direct or close contact with poultry or through exposure to environments that are contaminated with poultry. On this occasion it is presumed that the H7H9 virus infected an individual already infected by the then current epidemic H3N2 virus. No human-to-human transmission has been reported subsequently, but coinfection of human beings, birds, or other animals provides an opportunity for the emergence of a new reassortant. The paper by Yefei Zhu and colleagues describes such a situation whereby a 15 year old boy was hospitalised and found to be coinfected by the H3N2 epidemic influenza virus and in addition by the novel avian H7N9 influenza virus. The young patient was hospitalised and recovered after a period of treatment. No onward transmission of influenza virus was detected. Nonetheless, this incident may be a forewarning of such an outcome in the future. - Mod.CP
