Puerto Rico. December 2018. (published). The chikungunya epidemic began in May 2014 as the 1st occurrence of the virus in the country. Official surveillance reported 28 327 suspected chikungunya cases, of which 4339 were laboratory-confirmed; 31 persons died (0.9 deaths/100 000 population). The authors analyzed excess mortality from various causes for the same months during the previous 4 years and detected 1310 deaths possibly attributable to chikungunya virus infectoions.

Guadeloupe and Martinique. 28 Aug 2018. [published] In some chikungunya epidemics, deaths are not completely captured by traditional surveillance systems. The peak of the epidemic occurred in the month with the highest mortality, returning to normal soon after the end of the CHIKV epidemic. There were excess deaths in almost all age groups, and excess mortality rate was higher among the elderly but was similar between male and female individuals. The overall mortality estimated in the current study (639 deaths) was about 4 times greater than that obtained through death declarations (160 deaths).

Mozambique. 1 Jun 2018. (published) A cross-sectional study was conducted between March 2015 and May 2016 in 8 health facilities situated in central and northern Mozambique and recruited 392 patients with undifferentiated febrile illness from outpatient clinics. Serum samples from each participant were screened using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detection of anti-CHIK IgM and IgG antibodies. A subset of study samples (n = 37) was further tested by the plaque reduction neutralization assay (PRNT). Prevalence rates for IgM and IgG anti-CHIKV antibodies was 1.5 (6/392) and 28.6 percent (112/392), respectively. Most seropositive patients were from Cabo Delgado and Sofala provinces.

[2] Vertical transmission in _Aedes aegypti_
Date: Mon 16 Jul 2018

Costa CFd, Silva AVd, Nascimento VAd, Souza VCd, Monteiro DCdS, Terrazas WCM, et al. Evidence of vertical transmission of Zika virus in field-collected eggs of _Aedes aegypti_ in the Brazilian Amazon.

Abstract
Background
Arboviruses are viruses transmitted to humans and other animals by the bite of hematophagous arthropods. Infections caused by chikungunya virus (CHIKV), dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and the deadlier yellow fever virus (YFV) are current public health problems in several countries, mainly those located in tropical and subtropical regions. One of the main prevention strategies continues to be vector control, with the elimination of breeding sites and surveillance of infested areas. The use of ovitraps for _Aedes_ mosquitos monitoring has already demonstrated promising results, and maybe be also useful for arboviral surveillance.

Methods
This work aimed to detect natural vertical transmission of arboviruses in _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_. Mosquito egg collection was carried out using ovitraps in Itacoatiara, a mid-size city in Amazonas state, Brazil. Collected eggs were allowed to hatch and larvae were tested for CHIKV, DENV, and ZIKV RNA by RT-qPCR.

Results
A total of 2057 specimens (1793 _Ae. aegypti_ and 264 _Ae. albopictus_), in 154 larvae pools were processed. Results showed one positive pool for CHIKV and one positive pool for ZIKV. The active ZIKV infection was further confirmed by the detection of the negative-strand viral RNA and nucleotide sequencing which confirmed the Asian genotype. The Infection Rate per 1000 mosquitoes tested was assessed by Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) with 0.45 and 0.44 for CHIKV and ZIKV, respectively, and by Minimum Infection Rate (MIR) with 0.45 for both viruses.

Conclusion
To our knowledge, this is the 1st detection of ZIKV in natural vertical transmission in the _Ae. aegypti_, a fact that may contribute to ZIKV maintenance in nature during epidemics periods. Furthermore, our results highlight that the use of ovitraps and the molecular detection of arbovirus may contribute to health surveillance, directing the efforts to more efficient transmission blockade.

Author summary
The control of the vast majority of arbovirus infections relies on entomological measures to reduce mosquito infestation. Therefore, this study analyzed the use of ovitraps for arboviral surveillance in a mid-size city of the Amazonas state, Brazil. We found one larva pool infected with chikungunya virus, before the 1st human case confirmed in this municipality. Another pool was infected with Zika virus, demonstrating the 1st evidence that vertical transmission occurs in naturally infected _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito populations.

[The detection of transovarial transmission (TOT) is of epidemiological significance. Should TOT be efficient, the virus might be sustained in _Aedes aegypti_ populations without requiring human infectious blood meals and making control of the virus difficult. Further field and laboratory studies are needed to determine TOT efficiency. - Mod.TY]

Irina Maljkovic Berry, Fredrick Eyase, Simon Pollett, Limbaso, S Konongoi, Katherine Figueroa, Victor Ofula, et al. Recent outbreaks of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in Africa and Asia are driven by a variant carrying mutations associated with increased fitness for _Aedes aegypti_.

Abstract:
Background: In 2016, a chikungunya virus (CHIKV) outbreak was reported in Mandera, Kenya. This was the 1st major CHIKV outbreak in the country since the global re-emergence of this virus, which arose as an initial outbreak in Kenya in 2004. Therefore, we collected samples and sequenced viral genomes from the 2016 Mandera outbreak.

Methodology/Principal Findings: All Kenyan genomes contained 2 mutations, E1:K211E and E2:V264A, recently reported to have an association with increased infectivity, dissemination and transmission in the _Aedes aegypti_ vector. Phylogeographic inference of temporal and spatial virus relationships using Bayesian approaches showed that this _Ae. aegypti_ adapted strain emerged within the East, Central, and South African (ECSA) lineage of CHIKV between 2005 and 2008, most probably in India. It was also in India where the 1st large outbreak caused by this strain appeared, in New Delhi, 2010. More importantly, our results also showed that this strain is no longer contained in India, and that it has more recently caused several major outbreaks of CHIKV, including the 2016 outbreaks in India, Pakistan and Kenya, and the 2017 outbreak in Bangladesh. In addition to its capability to cause large outbreaks in different regions of the world, this CHIKV strain has the capacity to replace less adapted wild type strains in _Ae. aegypti_-rich regions. Indeed, all the latest full CHIKV genomes of the ECSA Indian Ocean Lineage (IOL), from the regions of high _Ae. aegypti_ prevalence, carry these 2 mutations, including samples collected in Japan, Australia, and China.

Conclusions/Significance: Our results point to the importance of continued genomic-based surveillance of this strain's global spread, and they prompt urgent vector competence studies in Asian and African countries, in order to assess the level of vector receptiveness, virus transmission, and the impact this might have on this strain's ability to cause major outbreaks.

[The authors make a good case for the need to assess chikungunya virus genomic variation and the relationship of these variants to _Aedes aegypti_ vector efficiency as they relate to the risk of outbreaks. Unfortunately, it is not easy to attract the resources necessary to do these kinds of studies in advance of a possible outbreak. - Mod.TY]

Heitmann Anna, Jansen Stephanie, Luhken Renke, Helms Michelle, Pluskota Bjorn, Becker Norbert, Kuhn Carola, Schmidt-Chanasit Jonas, Tannich Egbert. Experimental risk assessment for chikungunya virus transmission based on vector competence, distribution and temperature suitability in Europe, 2018.

Abstract
Background
Over the last decade, the abundant distribution of the Asian tiger mosquito _Aedes albopictus_ in southern Europe and the import of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) by infected travellers has resulted in at least 5 local outbreaks of chikungunya fever in France and Italy. Considering the ongoing spread of _Ae. albopictus_ to central Europe, we performed an analysis of the Europe-wide spatial risk of CHIKV transmission under different temperature conditions.

Methods
_Ae. albopictus_ specimens from Germany and Italy were orally infected with CHIKV from an outbreak in France and kept for 2 weeks at 18 C, 21 C or 24 C [64 F, 70 F or 75 F]. A salivation assay was conducted to detect infectious CHIKV.

Results
Analyses of mosquito saliva for infectious virus particles demonstrated transmission rates (TRs) of over 35 percent. Highest TRs of 50 percent for the mosquito population from Germany were detected at 18 C, while the Italian population had highest TRs of 63 percent at 18 C and 21 C, respectively. Temperature data indicated a potential risk of CHIKV transmission for extended durations, i.e. sufficiently long time periods allowing extrinsic incubation of the virus. This was shown for areas already colonised by _Ae. albopictus_, as well as for large parts of central Europe that are not colonised.

Conclusion
The current risk of CHIKV transmission in Europe is not primarily restricted by temperature, which allows extrinsic incubation of the virus, but rather by the vector distribution. Accordingly, all European countries with established populations of _Ae. albopictus_ should implement respective entomological surveillance and monitoring systems, as basis for suitable control measures.

[The 3 CHIKV outbreaks in France and 2 in Italy between 2007-2017 highlight the risk of autochthonous CHIKV transmission in Europe. This is a dynamic situation and can be expected to change as global warming is likely to extend the range of _Ae. albopictus_ northward into Europe. Interested readers are encouraged to access the full article with its table and maps. The risk map of CHIKV transmission is especially interesting.

In a related study the investigators compared the vector competence of an Italian population of _Aedes albopictus_ for 2 strains of chikungunya virus (CHIKV), with and without E1:A226V mutation, responsible for outbreaks in 2007 in the Emilia Romagna region and 2017 in the Lazio and Calabria regions, respectively. _Ae. albopictus_ showed similar vector competence for both viral strains, indicating that the E1:A226V mutation is not exclusively responsible for the ability of CHIKV to replicate well in this mosquito species.

[5] Vaccine progress
Date: Tue 6 Nov 2018
Source: LabBiotech [edited]
https://labiotech.eu/medical/chikungunya-virus-vaccine-themis/


The mosquito-borne chikungunya virus may one day have a vaccine, as an Austrian biotech's lead candidate gets positive results in Phase II.

Themis Bioscience measured the blood levels of antibodies against the company's vaccine in 263 healthy volunteers. The participants had produced antibodies to protect themselves against chikungunya 4 weeks after injections of its lead candidate vaccine.

"Up to 100 percent were protected after 2 vaccinations," Erich Tauber, CEO and founder of Themis, told me. "We also had excellent safety observations."

Themis makes the vaccine by modifying the measles vaccine Schwarz strain to express an antigen for chikungunya [virus]. The measles vaccine has been used in billions in people, so its safety and efficacy are well established.

Chikungunya [virus causes] a serious disease that causes joint pains and fever. Often resembling dengue fever in the initial stages, it is usually transmitted by mosquitoes from the _Aedes_ genus in tropical regions, but outbreaks have been recorded in Europe, such as in Italy last year [2017].

"The mosquito is now endemic in Southern Europe," Erich Tauber, CEO and founder of Themis, told me. "Countries like Austria, France and Croatia can have outbreaks now."

Furthermore, as globalization and climate change trends continue, Tauber told me that we will need more treatments for tropical diseases across the world. "We are going to have more of the so-called tropical infections in the future than we have had in the past."

As there is currently no treatment or vaccine in the market for chikungunya. Themis' vaccine, if approved, would have the advantage of being 1st to market. Themis is planning to start a Phase III trial of the chikungunya treatment in early 2020.

Other companies are also developing treatments for insect-borne diseases. Instead of vaccines, UK biotech Oxitec has released genetically engineered mosquitoes in Brazil that die out before they can pass on diseases. The Swiss company Humabs has an antibody treatment for Zika in preclinical development.

[6] Vaccine fast tracked
Date: Fri 4 May 2018
Source: MD [edited]
https://www.mdmag.com/medical-news/potential-chikungunya-virus-vaccine-designated-for-fda-fast-track


The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track designation to an investigative vaccine designed to prevent disease caused by chikungunya virus.

PaxVax, an independent specialty vaccine company, is developing the prophylaxis. Chikungunya [virus causes] a disease which includes headache, muscle pain, skin rash, and severe joint pain that can persist for years and spreads through mosquito bites and can result in widespread outbreaks. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the rate of infectious diseases transmitted from tick, flea, and mosquito bites to humans has more than tripled in the US in recent years.

Trials for the PaxVax vaccine, which is a virus-like particle (VLP) treatment licensed from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), recently began enrolling for a 400-paitent phase 2B dose-finding study. A previous phase 2A study conducted by the NIAID's parent organization the National Institutes of Health (NIH) tested the vaccine's effects in participants.

The virus is arthropod-borne and shares a close relation to other viruses identified in Africa, South America, and Australia. It's a small, spherical RNA virus vectored by the daytime-biting _Aedes aegypti _mosquito, better known for transmitting Zika virus, yellow fever, and dengue viruses.

Chikungunya [virus infection] has only recently become a domestic issue. The 1st local transmission of the disease in the Americas was diagnosed in the Caribbean in late 2013, but it has since been identified in 45 countries in the Western hemisphere. The Pan American Health Organization has identified more than 1.7 million possible cases since the 1st identification. Residents of and travelers to sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, India, the Caribbean, Central America, and South America [have been infected].

Individuals at greater risk of serious complications due to the virus include infants, elderly people, and people with chronic medical conditions.

If clinical development progresses, the PaxVax vaccine could become the 1st approved by the FDA for the prevention of chikungunya [virus infection]. Eva Harris, PhD, director, Center for Global Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, said the field is in "desperate need for a medical and public health intervention."

"It is exciting to see this vaccine candidate moving forward with Fast Track designation as this is an extremely debilitating disease with the potential for causing serious long-term sequelae," Harris said in a statement.

Lisa Danzig, MD, chief medical officer, ParVax, said the Fast Track designation is yet another positive step for the vaccine's development, as well as being a recognition of the unmet clinical need.

"This is another example of the capabilities of our technology platform and our steadfast commitment to developing specialty vaccines that protect against overlooked infectious diseases, as mosquito-borne diseases continue to increase due to air travel and warmer weather," Danzig said.

Results of the phase 2B trial are expected to be finalized in early 2019.

Rong Zhang, Arthur S. Kim, Julie M. Fox, Sharmila Nair, Katherine Basore, William B. Klimstra, et al. Mxra8 is a receptor for multiple arthritogenic alphaviruses.

Abstract
Arthritogenic alphaviruses comprise a group of enveloped RNA viruses that are transmitted to humans by mosquitoes and cause debilitating acute and chronic musculoskeletal disease. The host factors required for alphavirus entry remain poorly characterized. Here, we use a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9-based screen to identify the cell adhesion molecule Mxra8 as an entry mediator for multiple emerging arthritogenic alphaviruses, including chikungunya, Ross River, Mayaro and O'nyong nyong viruses. Gene editing of mouse Mxra8 or human MXRA8 resulted in reduced levels of viral infection of cells and, reciprocally, ectopic expression of these genes resulted in increased infection. Mxra8 bound directly to chikungunya virus particles and enhanced virus attachment and internalization into cells. Consistent with these findings, Mxra8-Fc fusion protein or anti-Mxra8 monoclonal antibodies blocked chikungunya virus infection in multiple cell types, including primary human synovial fibroblasts, osteoblasts, chondrocytes and skeletal muscle cells. Mutagenesis experiments suggest that Mxra8 binds to a surface-exposed region across the A and B domains of chikungunya virus E2 protein, which are a speculated site of attachment. Finally, administration of the Mxra8-Fc protein or anti-Mxra8 blocking antibodies to mice reduced chikungunya and O'nyong nyong virus infection as well as associated foot swelling. Pharmacological targeting of Mxra8 could form a strategy for mitigating infection and disease by multiple arthritogenic alphaviruses.

Sarah Keller White, Carla Mavian ,Marco Salemi, John Glenn Morris Jr., Maha A. Elbadry, Bernard A. Okech, et al. A new "American" subgroup of African-lineage Chikungunya virus detected in and isolated from mosquitoes collected in Haiti, 2016.

Abstract
As part of on-going arboviral surveillance activity in a semi-rural region in Haiti, chikungunya virus (CHIKV)-positive mosquito pools were identified in 2014 (the peak of the Caribbean Asian-clade epidemic), and again in 2016 by RT-PCR. In 2014, CHIKV was only identified in _Aedes aegypti_ (11 positive pools/124 screened). In contrast, in sampling in 2016, CHIKV was not identified in _Ae. aegypti_, but, rather, in (a) a female _Aedes albopictus_ pool, and (b) a female _Culex quinquefasciatus_ pool. Genomic sequence analyses indicated that the CHIKV viruses in the 2016 mosquito pools were from the East-Central-South African (ECSA) lineage, rather than the Asian lineage. In phylogenetic studies, these ECSA lineage strains form a new ECSA subgroup (subgroup IIa) together with Brazilian ECSA lineage strains from an isolated human outbreak in 2014, and a mosquito pool in 2016. Additional analyses date the most recent common ancestor of the ECSA IIa subgroup around May 2007, and the 2016 Haitian CHIKV genomes around December 2015. Known CHIKV mutations associated with improved _Ae. albopictus_ vector competence were not identified. Isolation of this newly identified lineage from _Ae. albopictus_ is of concern, as this vector has a broader geographic range than _Ae. aegypti_, especially in temperate areas of North America, and stresses the importance for continued vector surveillance.

[The isolation of this new lineage of chikungunya virus from _Aedes albopictus_ and _Culex quinquefasciatus_ pools is an important 1st step in pointing the way to laboratory studies that would establish their susceptibility to the virus and ability (or not) to transmit it efficiently. It is reasonable to assume that new lineages of CHIKV will emerge over time. - Mod.TY]
