Regarding the claim that "this was the world's 1st known case of
naturally-transmitted infection":

_Plum pox virus_ is vectored by a number of aphid species and is well
known to spread in most if not all contaminated countries via the
activity of these vectors. The claim therefore makes no sense unless
restricted in some way (for example first case of naturally
transmitted infection in Japan, first case of naturally transmitted
infection through a new mechanism, etc...).

For recent information on aphid transmission of PPV see, for example:
Labonne G & Dallot S, 2006. Epidemiology of sharka disease in France.
EPPO Bulletin, 36, 267-270 and
Cambra et al., 2006. Epidemiology of Sharka disease in Spain. EPPO
Bulletin, 36, 271-275.

A case where the evidence for diagnosis is not available. Is the news
of the outbreak based on symptoms, electron microscopy, or sequence
data?

This should be regarded as a cautionary note to raise the possibility
that either a related or new virus is causing stonefruit disease in
Japan. The issue of correct diagnosis at the sequence level is
paramount.

[Our sincere thanks to both Dr Candresse and Prof Randles for their
valuable comments. It appears that further information is needed to
clarify the PPV status of stonefruit in Japan.
