Hungarian health authorities have reported (computer translated) 4 human cutaneous anthrax cases, at least one confirmed, in 2 separate counties in recent weeks. The affected individuals were reported from farms in Bacs-Kiskun and Bekes counties. In addition, an additional 30 people were treated prophylactically with antibiotics due to possible exposure. These are the 1st human anthrax cases in Hungary in several years.

Animal health officials have reported a confirmed anthrax case in a cow and an additional 4 suspect [animal] cases on an outbreak in Kotegyan, Bekes.

Anthrax is a serious infectious disease caused by gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria known as Bacillus anthracis. Anthrax can be found naturally in soil and commonly affects domestic and wild animals around the world. Although it is rare, people can get sick with anthrax if they come in contact with infected animals or contaminated animal products.

[I would not be surprised if these human cases in Bacs-Kiskun and Bekes counties were in relation to farms that were affected in 2018 and now suffering resurgent livestock outbreaks. It is hard to tell whether the 4 additional animal cases in Kotegyan were late cases in the index outbreak or on separate properties. Obviously the veterinary authorities will have to cast their vaccination cover much wider than was originally envisaged, and the sooner the better in both affected counties.

To locate the affected area in Hungary go to the previous report by OIE; 17 Apr 2019 Anthrax - Hungary: (BE) cattle, OIE 20190417.6427877. With thanks to Michael for this report. - Mod.MHJ]
