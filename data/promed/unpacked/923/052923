Almost 90 000 doses of the drug produced by Guangdong Bioyee
Pharmaceutical Co, Ltd, have been recalled, said the officials. In
Beijing 68 558 bottles of the drug have been recalled, along with 20
000 bottles in Guangdong Province. The officials did not reveal how
many people taking the drug had been infected with hepatitis C
antibodies but said the tainted drugs produced after last September
had been sold in 12 provinces and regions.
Local health authorities in south China's Guangdong province were
aware that the company responsible for the China's hepatitis C
scandal had illegally procured blood stocks, Thursday's [25 Jan 2007]
China Business News (CBN) reported. Last August [2006], Guangdong
health department found Guangdong Bioyee Pharmaceutical Co, Ltd had
been collecting blood plasma illegally to make immunoglobulin and
other drugs, the newspaper quoted an industry insider as saying. It
ordered the company to halt any illegal practices but did not suspend
production or impose any punishment, CBN said.
An unnamed official from the Shaoguan City Drug and Food Bureau told
CBN an inspection team from a "related department" had carried out
another inspection in November [2006] and had discovered
"illegalities" in the company's manufacturing processes, without elaborating.
Despite these 2 failed inspections, the source from the Shaoguan
Bureau said Bioyee had still managed to obtain a Good Manufacturing
Practice (GMP) certificate, which is usually granted by the State
Food and Drug Administration (SFDA), valid from 24 Nov [2006].
However, another investigation was launched in December [2006] by the
SFDA, which reported that the company was unable to provide a record
of production and testing of its drugs, and was using faked licenses
for some batches of pharmaceuticals. It is not clear why the
investigation was launched so soon after Bioyee secured the GMP
certificate. On 16 Jan [2007], the MOH revoked Bioyee's GMP
certificate and license.
The Ministry of Health (MOH) issued an urgent statement on Wednesday
[24 Jan 2007] ordering all medical institutions to register patients
who have used the drug. Those who have used the intravenously
administered drug must be given blood tests for hepatitis C [virus]
nucleic acid and antibodies, and should be put under close
observation, the MOH said.
Doctor Jia Jidong, of the Beijing Friendship Hospital, estimated that
about 50 to 85 percent of patients who have tested positive for
antibodies would end up contracting the disease. If the tests show
the Hepatitis C antibodies to change from positive to negative in 2-8
weeks, the patients are not infected with the virus, he confirmed.

[Hepatitis C is a liver disease caused by hepatitis C virus, which is
present in the blood of persons who have the disease. HCV is spread
by contact with the blood of an infected person. Prior to 1992 the
presence of hepatitis C virus in blood collected for transfusion was
an unrecognized hazard. At the present time considerable effort is
devoted to ensuring that blood used for transfusion is free of
hepatitis C virus. This is an expensive procedure limiting the
abundance of blood available for safe transfusion. The use of blood
contaminated with hepatitis C virus as a resource for preparation of
biologically active materials (e.g. antibodies, etc) is an attraction
for some unscrupulous individuals and enterprises. - Mod.CP]
