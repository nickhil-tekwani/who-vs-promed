Outbreak of Bovine Paralytic Rabies, in the Municipality of Palenque,
Chiapas, Mexico.
In order to clarify and correct the data posted several times regarding the
recent outbreak of bovine rabies in Mexico, I would like to share the
official Mexican government information.
The municipality of Palenque is located in the northern area of the state
of Chiapas (the most Southwestern state of Mexico). This region is mostly
dedicated to raise cattle, estimated in around 162 785 animals, which
represents the 10% of the total cattle population in the state. Beef and
dairy cattle are raised in an extensive grazing system.
After notifications were received regarding high mortality in cattle of the
area, SAGAR (acronym in Spanish for Secretariat for Agriculture, Livestock
and Rural Development) instructed the DINESA (acronym in Spanish for
National Emergency Mechanism in Animal Health) to carry on an
epidemiological survey in order to assess the overall situation.
Due to the fact that at the beginning of the outbreak the agent involved
was unknown, confusion was generalized between cattle representatives,
affected producers and even some municipal authorities, this very much
motivated by several press publications.
The results of the investigation carried on from 11 Feb to 24 Mar 2000
yielded the following data:
The Palenque-Catazaja outbreak was located in a radius of 30 kilometers
around Palenque, including a population of 13 954 cattle, from which 583
died. This figure represented the 0.35 percent of the total cattle
population in the municipality. [Of the affected cattle 44% were under one
year old and 56 percent over one year old.
Clinical signs were clearly related to neurological disease, loss of
coordination (specially in hind legs), excessive salivation, anorexia,
tenesmus, ataxia, drowsiness, dyspnea, aggressiveness, and in some cases,
diarrhea and pneumonia. The duration of the disease was 5 days average.
It is important to mention samples from organs, blood, sera and
cerebrospinal fluid were submitted to the laboratory in order to discard
other sort of etiologies. Only rabies positive results were found in the
time period. The diagnostic test was direct immunofluorescence (IF), in
some cases histopathology was made when IF was not conclusive.
Once rabies virus was confirmed in the laboratory, actions directed to
control the disease were conducted in considered risk areas. Such actions
included the following:
-Vaccination of all bovines in the municipality, for which "Alianza para el
Campo" (Federal program for enhancing agriculture production) allocated, 18
000 doses of vaccine, also the Regional Cattle Union acquired during the
month of December, 10 000 doses for its associates. Presently, the Regional
Cattle Union continues to distribute the vaccine at a low price.
-Training of technical personnel on the capture of vampire bats, which
together with the brigades of the Animal Health State Committee carried on
capture and treatment of vectors in the field.
- Organization of talks to producers for the recognition of the bovine
paralytic rabies signs and its prevention and control by personnel from
DINESA as well as from the Animal Health State Committee.
- Orientation for human population through educational programs carried out
by the sanitary jurisdiction of the Secretariat of Health to raise
awareness and detect cases considered under risk or identify people that
were attacked by vampire bats
Currently, the outbreak had been controlled in the area, and cattle
producers have been sensitized on the importance of maintaining a
vaccination program in their cattle as well as of performing periodical
actions to control the vector due to its endemic presence. The previous
statement had been demonstrated by a significant decrease in the number of
cases and mortalities in bovine population since the beginning of April.
