Leptospirosis is a disease carried by rats which is transmitted by infected urine or tissue, and the RSPCA is growing concerned about the prevalence of the disease in NSW since a significant number of dogs in Sydney's inner west have become infected with the disease. Worryingly, the disease can also be transmitted to humans.

As a result, the RSPCA will be offering free vaccinations for the disease with every annual or triannual vaccination appointment at the RSPCA Sydney Veterinary Hospital from 27 Jul 2019 to 31 Aug 2019.

However, if all you want is a vaccine for the rat disease (leptospirosis), you can get it alone for a one-off payment of AUD 30 [USD 21].

Unfortunately, there is no vaccine currently available for cats against leptospirosis, so all persons in affected areas should keep their feline friends indoors.

Leptospirosis is a bacterial infection, and dogs can become hosts for the disease if food, water or bedding comes into contact with affected [infected] surfaces. Furthermore, the disease can be transmitted via contact with gum abrasions or broken skin. It can take [approximately] 7 days for signs to appear, and they include vomiting, lethargy and diarrhoea.

The RSPCA recommends that all dog owners steer clear of leptospira bacterial breeding grounds, such as moist, warm environments and stagnant water.

[This seems like a public health service announcement regarding protecting your dog from leptospirosis, and getting all the other necessary vaccines for your dog.

Unfortunately, cats exposed to rodents may succumb to the disease. It can indeed be fatal to cats. It is really quite shameful that there is no safe and effective vaccine to prevent cats from succumbing to this nasty bacterial disease.
