Health officials are investigating an outbreak of _Escherichia coli_ infection linked to Chipotle restaurants in Washington state and Oregon, health officials said on Saturday 31 Oct 2015. 3 people in the Portland [Oregon] area and at least 19 people in Washington have become sick after eating at the Mexican food chain since 14 Oct 2015, the Oregon Health Authority said. No deaths have been reported and about a third of the people have been hospitalized, agency spokesman Jonathan Modie said.

Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. spokesman Chris Arnold said the safety and wellbeing of customers is always its highest priority. He said Chipotle was notified by health officials that they were investigating _E. coli_ cases that included people who became sick after eating at 6 restaurants. "We immediately closed all of our restaurants in the area out of an abundance of caution, even though the vast majority of these restaurants have no reported problems," Arnold said in a statement. The company said 43 Chipotle sites have been closed in the 2 states. Chipotle will work with health officials to determine when to reopen the restaurants and to find the cause of the problem, Arnold said.

Modie said many people may not see a doctor after becoming ill, so the number of people sickened in the outbreak is likely higher. People who become sick with vomiting and bloody diarrhea, and who ate at a Chipotle between 14 and 23 Oct 2015 should see their health care provider, officials said. People have reported symptoms of infection in Clackamas and Washington counties in Oregon, and Clark, King, Skagit and Cowlitz counties in Washington, Modie said.

[Other parallel reports confirm that the _E. coli_ is an EHEC strain. ProMED-mail awaits more information regarding the scope of the outbreak and the potential food reservoir or reservoirs. Since many ingredients can be stored and served together, it can be difficult sometimes to pin down the exact source. - Mod.LL
