The Waupaca County Health Department reports that a horse in Waupaca County tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis (EEE).

"The middle-aged unvaccinated Haflinger gelding from Waupaca County was found down with neurologic signs on 6 Sep 2016 and was tested," the Equine Disease Communications Center reported. "He did not respond to treatment and was euthanized on 7 Sep 2016. That is the 3rd confirmed equine case in Wisconsin this year [2016]."

No EEE cases in humans have been reported in Wisconsin this year [2016] or any year since 2011. The human EEE case in 2011 was only the 2nd case known to have occurred in Wisconsin since 1984.

EEE virus is transmitted to humans, horses, birds and other animals during bites from infected mosquitoes. Mosquitoes acquire EEE virus by feeding on infected birds. The virus is not transmitted person to person or directly between animals or between animals and humans. Presence of an EEE positive horse confirms that there are mosquitoes in the area infected with the EEE virus that can transmit the virus to people and other animals.

Most people infected with EEE virus do not have symptoms. However, some infected people develop encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) that typically begins with sudden onset of fever, headache, chills and vomiting. The illness may become severe resulting in disorientation, seizures, coma or death. There is no specific treatment for this EEE illness.

Clinical signs of EEE infection in horses include depression, loss of appetite, drooping eyelids and lower lip, blindness, paralysis, and death. Horse owners can vaccinate their horses against EEE virus to protect them from becoming ill.

"Because EEE virus is known to be currently circulating, Waupaca County residents and visitors should be vigilant in taking measures to prevent mosquito bites," said Jed Wohlt, with the Waupaca County health officer. "It is important that people contact their healthcare provider if they suspect they have EEE illness." The best way to avoid mosquitoborne diseases is to reduce exposure to mosquitoes and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. When cold weather arrives, the mosquitoes will be eliminated, but until then, people are urged to take measures to protect themselves.

The Waupaca County Health Department recommends the following:
- limit time spent outside at dawn and dusk, when mosquitoes are most active;
- apply insect repellant to clothing as well as exposed skin since mosquitoes may bite through clothing;
- make sure window and door screens are in good repair to prevent mosquito entry;
- properly dispose of items that hold water, such as tin cans, plastic containers, ceramic pots, or discarded tires;
- clean roof gutters and downspouts for proper drainage;
- turn over wheelbarrows, wading pools, boats, and canoes when not in use;
- change the water in birdbaths and pet dishes at least every 3 days;
- clean and chlorinate swimming pools, outdoor saunas, and hot tubs; drain water from pool covers;
- trim tall grass, weeds, and vines since mosquitoes use these areas to rest during hot daylight hours;
- landscape to prevent water from pooling in low-lying areas.

On 15 Sep 2016, the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development received notice that a 4 month old standardbred filly from Clare County had tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis (EEE). The filly developed a sudden fever, began staggering, and eventually became unable to rise. The filly was not vaccinated against EEE and died.

A viral disease, EEE affects the central nervous system and is transmitted to horses by infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs of EEE include moderate to high fever, depression, lack of appetite, cranial nerve deficits (facial paralysis, tongue weakness, difficulty swallowing), behavioral changes (aggression, self-mutilation, or drowsiness), gait abnormalities, or severe central nervous system signs, such as head-pressing, circling, blindness, and seizures. The course of EEE can be swift, with death occurring 2 to 3 days after onset of clinical signs despite intensive care; fatality rates reach 75-8 per cent among horses. Horses that survive may have long-lasting impairments and neurologic problems.

Horse owners should also consult their private practicing veterinarian to determine an appropriate disease prevention plan for their horses. Vaccines have proven to be a very effective prevention tool. Horses that have been vaccinated in past years will need an annual booster shot. However, if an owner did not vaccinate their animal in previous years, the horse will need the 2-shot vaccination series within a 3-6 week period.

In addition to vaccinations, horse owners also need to reduce the mosquito population and possible breeding areas. Recommendations include removing stagnant water sources, keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, which are typically early in the morning and evening, and using mosquito repellents.

["Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is a member of the genus Alphavirus, family Togaviridae. Other medically important alphaviruses found in the Americas include western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV) and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV). EEEV has a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome. The virus particles are spherical and have a diameter of 60-65 nm. Of the 4 lineages of EEEV, Group I is endemic in North America and the Caribbean and causes most human disease cases; the other 3 groups (IIA, IIB, and III) cause primarily equine illness in Central and South America." http://www.cdc.gov/EasternequineEncephalitis/tech/virus.html

"Wild birds are the reservoir hosts, and the black-tailed mosquito, _Culiseta melanura_, is the vector in swamps. Other mosquito species may act as bridge vectors, carrying the virus out of swamps into adjoining localities and transmitting the virus to humans prior to vector season in the spring. In animals at high risk or with limited immunity, more frequent vaccination or appropriately timed vaccination is recommended in order to induce protective immunity during periods of likely exposure. In areas where mosquitoes are active year-round, many veterinarians elect to vaccinate horses at 6 month intervals to ensure uniform protection throughout the year, although this practice is not specifically recommended by manufacturers of vaccines.

"Adult horses, previously unvaccinated against EEE/WEE or of unknown vaccination history: administer a primary series of 2 doses with a 3 or 4 to 6 week interval between doses. Revaccinate prior to the onset of the next vector season and annually thereafter.

"Pregnant mares, previously vaccinated against EEE/WEE: vaccinate 4 to 6 weeks before foaling.

"Pregnant mares, unvaccinated or having unknown vaccinal history: immediately begin a 2-dose primary series with a 3 or 4 week interval between doses. Booster at 4 to 6 weeks before foaling or prior to the onset of the next vector season, whichever occurs 1st.

"Foals of mares vaccinated against EEE/WEE in the pre-partum period: administer a primary 3-dose series beginning at 4 to 6 months of age. A 3 or 4 to 6-week interval between the 1st and 2nd doses is recommended. The 3rd dose should be administered at 10 to 12 months of age, prior to the onset of the next mosquito season.

"In the south eastern US, due to earlier seasonal disease risk, vaccination may be started at 2 to 3 months of age. When initiating vaccinations in younger foals, a series of 4 primary doses should be administered, with a 3 or 4 week interval between the 1st and 2nd doses and a 4 week interval between the 2nd and 3rd doses. The 4th dose should be administered at 10 to 12 months of age, prior to the onset of the next mosquito season.

"Foals of unvaccinated mares or having unknown vaccinal history: administer a primary series of 3 doses with a 30 day interval between the 1st and 2nd doses and a 60 day [8 week] interval between the 2nd and 3rd doses. The primary series of vaccinations should be initiated at 3 to 4 months of age and, where possible, be completed prior to the onset of the high-risk insect vector season. If the primary series is initiated during the mosquito vector season, an interval of 3 to 4 weeks between the 2nd and 3rd doses is preferable to the interval of 8 weeks described above.

"Horses having been naturally infected and recovered: recovered horses likely develop lifelong immunity. Consider revaccination only if the immune status of the animal changes the risk for susceptibility to infection. Examples of these conditions would include the long-term use of corticosteroids and pituitary adenoma."
