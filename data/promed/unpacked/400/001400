One person died, while 29 were admitted after a disease outbreak in Tigania West, Meru county.

Cases were reported on Tuesday [26 Dec 2017] afternoon in Kianjai and Mbeu wards, where residents feared a cholera outbreak, but the county health officer reported a case of amoebiasis.

One patient, 95, from Lairang'i died yesterday [27 Dec 2017] afternoon, while his wife and son were admitted at Isiolo hospital with vomiting, abdominal pains and diarrhea.

Residents cited a lack of clean water and asked county and national government health officers to speedily administer door to door vaccines and supply medicine.

Lairang'i sub-location manager Norman Mwiti said most families do not have access to water and that Mburanaro stream and a borehole in Buuri constituency were "very contaminated." Mwiti, sub-county health officials and area sub-chief Kawira Mwenda visited affected families and found that both adults and children were sick.

Administrators warned locals against visiting their friends and relatives and sharing food and water at public gatherings.

County public health director Ephantus Kariuki ruled out cholera and said a laboratory report showed most residents were suffering from amoebiasis, a bacterial infection that also results from the contamination of food and water.

The officer said they visited several parts and believed the outbreak was worsened by festivities. "This resulted from contamination of food during the festive season. I have been to Ruiri where some of affected people are drunkards," he said. "Most cases were reported on Friday [date?] when the holiday began. The lab analysis shows this is amoebiasis.

21 cases had been reported at Ruiri Mission Health Centre, and most of the victims were aged 30 to 70. Five similar cases were reported at Chaaria hospital and 2 at Meru Teaching and Referral Hospital.

Kariuki advised locals to boil drinking water and noted Karuna stream and rivers may be contaminated. The officer said no new cases had been reported in Mukindu.

[Amoebiasis is caused by an intestinal infection with _Entamoeba histolytica_. The acute infection often causes dysentery, i.e. bloody stools, which is not mentioned as a key symptom here. The diagnostic information is limited. Thus, we do not know whether feces cultures were performed and whether they included cultures for _Vibrio cholerae_. Feces microscopy for _Entmoeba histolytica_ cysts are difficult even in experienced hands, and identification of living amoeba in feces requires microscopy of a warm stool sample. It is presumed that molecular methods were not used. Thus, the diagnosis remains uncertain, and ProMED-mail will be happy to post further information. - Mod.EP
