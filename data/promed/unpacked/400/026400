This year's [2007] outbreak of contagious diseases among giant pandas
has emphasized the need for more measures to ensure the bears' future
safety, delegates to the 18th Annual Conference of the Chinese
Committee of Breeding Techniques for the Giant Panda have said.

Zhang Zhihe, the committee's chairman, said to avoid possible future
outbreaks of highly infectious diseases, such as SARS (severe acute
respiratory syndrome) and bird flu, it is critical to do more
research on the supervision, prevention and treatment of such
conditions -- as well as so far undiagnosed diseases -- and establish
an emergency response system.

Giant pandas have been forced to move from a mountainous area of
southwestern China due to food shortages, as their bamboo food
flowers and dies as part of a natural cycle, an animal expert said.

Speaking at the 5-day conference, which ended Thursday [15 Nov 2007]
in the Sichuan provincial capital, Yang Xuyu, deputy chief of Sichuan
Wildlife Management Station, said about 20 panda cubs are bred in
captivity every year in China. But if the bears live together in
confined spaces, contagious diseases can quickly spread.

A delegate who asked not to be named said 10 pandas at the Wolong
Nature Reserve this year [2007] became infected with a rare
contagious disease from which 2 of them later died [Could the nature
of the suspected "rare" disease be specified? Clinical signs,
laboratory tests etc. will be helpful. - Mod.AS].

Vets from the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding, where
Zhang is based, worked with staff from Wolong to treat the sick
pandas but failed to diagnose the ailment, he said.

Yang said that in an effort to prevent the spread of potentially
fatal diseases, additional enclosures for the bears will be built at
both Chengdu and Wolong.

The State Forestry Administration recently gave Wolong 20 million
yuan [USD 2.7 million] to build 40 new dens some 20 km from its
existing ones. The Chengdu base is currently considering possible
sites for its new compounds, he said.

Yang also warned of the danger of bamboo flowering, which, since
2005, has expanded to an area of 24 000 hectares in Sichuan, about
1.4 percent of the edible bamboo in the province, he told China Daily.

Nine varieties of bamboo have been seen flowering, which account for
about 30 percent of the varieties eaten by pandas.

In the 1980s, in the mountainous regions of Sichuan, extensive
blossoming of the arrow bamboo -- the pandas' favorite -- led to many
bears dying of disease and starvation, Yang said.

This year [2007], to avoid a recurrence, the Sichuan provincial
forestry bureau has developed an emergency response plan and asked
local forestry bureaus to implement it in the event of extensive
blossoming.

Yang said that if 15 percent of the total bamboo area or 100 percent
of a single variety is found to be flowering, all bears in that area
will be inoculated and/or relocated to ensure their safety.

Often referred to as living fossils, giant pandas are found mainly in
Sichuan, which is home to about 1200 of them, or 76 percent of the
country's total.

More than 80 officials and experts from animal protection
organizations in 8 countries attended this year's [2007] conference.
