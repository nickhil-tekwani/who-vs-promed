The following may be relevant to the current Q fever report
[Q Fever - Japan (02), see above
Abstract:
As a result of dramatic political and economic changes in the beginning of
the 1990s, Q fever epidemiology in Bulgaria has changed. The number of goats
almost tripled; contact between goat owners (and their families) and goats,
as well as goats and other animals, increased; consumption of raw goat milk
and its products increased; and goats replaced cattle and sheep as the main
source of human _Coxiella burnetii_ infections. Hundreds of overt,
serologically confirmed human cases of acute Q fever have occurred. Chronic
forms of Q fever manifesting as endocarditis were also observed.
In contrast, in Slovakia, Q fever does not pose a serious public health
problem, and the chronic form of infection has not been found either in
follow-ups of a Q fever epidemic connected with goats imported from Bulgaria
and other previous Q fever outbreaks, or in a serologic survey. Serologic
diagnosis as well as control and prevention of Q fever are discussed.
