Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) on Friday afternoon [29 Oct 2021] announced that the department is investigating a case of rabies in a child who was bitten by a bat. The child is a resident of Medina County and is currently receiving care in a Texas hospital.

Public health personnel have identified all places where someone could have come into contact with the bat or the rabies patient and directly contacted anyone who may have been exposed. Health officials are assessing them to determine their risk and whether they should receive post-exposure vaccination to prevent them from getting sick with rabies. People who need to be assessed have received a phone or written notification from DSHS. Those who were not contacted have no need for concern over this situation. [This article does not identify how or if the bat in question was identified to be tested. Consequently, I suspect this is a shortened version of what happened in order to protect the family involved in this situation. - Mod.TG].

Rabies is a viral illness usually spreading through the bite of an infected animal. It may also be possible to transmit the virus if infected saliva enters the eyes, nose or mouth or a break in the skin. Once someone becomes sick with rabies, it is almost always fatal. However, the illness is preventable if rabies vaccine and immune globulin are administered before symptoms start.

There are a number of things people can do to help stop the spread of rabies:

- Never approach wild animals.
- If bitten or scratched by a bat or any other animal, wash the wound immediately with soap and water. Then, seek medical attention to be assessed for potential rabies exposure.
- Ensure domestic dogs and cats are up to date on rabies vaccination, as required by state law.
- Consider protecting livestock and domestic ferrets by vaccinating them.

In Texas, skunks and bats account for most animal rabies cases, but any mammal can become infected and potentially spread it to other animals or humans. Last year [2020], nearly 600 animals tested positive for rabies across all regions of the state; about half were bats.

The last human case of rabies in a Texas resident was in 2009. DSHS will not release any additional information about the current rabies patient to protect the patient's identity. Additional information on rabies in Texas is available at <dshs.texas.gov/idcu/disease/rabies.aspx>.

The Wichita Falls-Wichita County Public Health District is warning the public to stay vigilant after a kitten found at Sikes Center Mall tested positive for rabies. A resident found a Siamese kitten at Sikes Center Mall and took it home. However, the cat quickly became ill and passed away soon after being taken to a vet. Animal Services officers sent the kitten to the Department of State Services, which notified local authorities on Thursday [28 Oct 2021] the cat [kitten actually] had tested positive for rabies.

Authorities are asking anyone who might have come into contact with the kitten between 12 Oct and 18 Oct 2021 to immediately call the Local Rabies Control Authority.

The positive exposure comes after a bat also tested positive for rabies on 22 Sep 2021.

[3] Idaho (Boise County): bat, human case of rabies
Date: Thu 4 Nov 2021

The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare and Central District Health is reporting the 1st human case of rabies and subsequent death reported in Idaho since 1978. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed the diagnosis after testing at its lab.

"This tragic case highlights how important it is Idahoans are aware of the risk of rabies exposure," said state epidemiologist Dr Christine Hahn. "Although deaths are rare, it is critical people exposed to a bat receive appropriate treatment to prevent the onset of rabies as soon as possible."

In late August [2021], a Boise County man encountered a bat on his property. It flew near him and became caught in his clothing, but he did not believe he had been bitten or scratched. In October, he fell ill and was hospitalized in Boise, where he subsequently died. It was not until after the investigation into his illness began that the bat exposure was discovered.

Public health officials are working closely with the family and healthcare providers. Central District Health is working with the hospital where he was treated to identify people who may have been exposed. Those who had contact with secretions from the individual are being assessed and will be given rabies preventive treatment as needed.

Rabies has the highest mortality rate of any disease. While cases of human rabies in the United States are rare, rabies exposures are common, with an estimated 60 000 Americans receiving the post-exposure vaccination series each year. The rabies virus infects the central nervous system, ultimately causing disease in the brain and death. Without preventive treatment, rabies is almost always fatal.

"Idahoans are reminded bats can become infected with rabies. While bats can be beneficial to our environment, people should be wary of any bat encounter, including waking up to a bat in your room, or any situation where there may have been a bite or scratch," said Dr Leslie Tengelsen, state public health veterinarian.

Bats are the most commonly identified species with rabies in Idaho. "Every year we have several people and pets exposed to rabies in our district, generally spring through fall," said Central District Health communicable disease control program manager Lindsay Haskell. "We want our residents and visitors to Idaho to be informed of the risk of rabies, to take appropriate steps to limit risk, and to take action when necessary."

People usually know when they have been bitten by a bat, but bats have very small teeth and the bite mark may not be easy to see. If you have contact with a bat or wake up to a bat in your bedroom, tent, or cabin, and are not sure if you were exposed, do not release the bat because it should be appropriately captured for rabies testing. If the bat is available for testing and the results are negative, preventive treatment is not needed. The only way rabies can be confirmed in a bat is through laboratory testing. You cannot tell just by looking at a bat if it has rabies.

Sometimes, the bat is not available for testing; in this case, if there has been a possible exposure, treatment with rabies vaccine and rabies immune globulin may be recommended in case the bat was rabid. Call your doctor or local health department to help determine if you could have been exposed to rabies and whether you need preventive treatment.

Fourteen bats have tested positive for rabies in Idaho so far during 2021. During 2020, 11% of the 159 bats tested were positive for rabies.

https://www.wsls.com/news/local/2021/10/28/one-person-hospitalized-after-bobcat-attack-in-grayson-county/


A bobcat that attacked multiple people, as well as animals, has tested positive for rabies, according to the Mount Rogers Health District. This comes after the cat attacked 2 men and a woman on Wednesday [27 Oct 2021] at about 6:40 pm. Authorities say the incident happened in the Mouth of Wilson area of the county, on Fox Creek Road.

Officers report the bobcat also attacked some cattle and a dog in the area. [It's hoped the dog was vaccinated against rabies. Readers of this report will also recall this moderator advocates vaccinating cattle, horses, goats, sheep and any other livestock animal you have contact with. - Mod.TG]

On Thursday morning [28 Oct 2021], the bobcat was hit and killed by a vehicle driving on Fox Creek Road. The animal was then transported to the health department for examination and testing. The next day [29 Oct 2021] the large male bobcat tested positive for rabies. Health officials say it may have been infectious and active in the area for several days.

Anyone who has had contact with a suspicious bobcat or who has pets having had contact with the animal should contact the Grayson County Health Department.

[5] Virginia (Fairfax County): cat, human exposure
Date: Wed 3 Nov 2021 15:50 EDT

https://patch.com/virginia/greateralexandria/rabies-exposures-possible-after-attacks-cat-rose-hill


The Fairfax County Health Department is warning residents of a potential rabies exposure after 3 unprovoked attacks involving an aggressive cat in the Rose Hill area. A cat spotted in the 6000 block of Leewood Drive, Alexandria was confirmed to have rabies, according to the health department. The small brown tabby cat was described as aggressive during the attacks, which were reportedly unprovoked.

Two attacks happened in the 6000 block of Leewood Drive, and the 3rd happened in the 5000 block of Greenhaven Place, Alexandria. The 1st incident happened 29 Oct 2021, and the others happened on 30 Oct 2021.

The health department believes the cat may have had contact with other people or pets. Anyone who believes they were bitten and/or scratched by the cat are urged to contact the health department rabies program. The cat is a young female and is spayed. Because the cat is spayed, the cat may have had an owner.

Rabies spreads when an infected animal's saliva or central nervous tissue enters an open wound, mouth, nose or eyes. The infection is caused by a virus and can spread to mammal wildlife such as foxes, raccoons, skunks and bats as well as domestic pets like cats and dogs. People can get infected when bitten or scratched by an infected animal.

There have been 19 animals diagnosed with rabies so far in Fairfax County this year [2021]. Animals infected with rabies may act aggressive, while wildlife may act docile [the reverse may also be true. - Mod.TG]. Signs can include drooling, staggering or stumbling when moving, or becoming paralyzed. Rabid animals or bites should be reported to Fairfax County Animal Protection Police.

When bitten or scratched, the health department urges immediate washing of the wound with soap and water before seeking medical attention. The [post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)] rabies vaccine effectively prevents rabies [virus in people] when provided [with]in [a specific] time; otherwise, it is fatal to mammals. [Rabies vaccine is usually regarded as the vaccine received by pets to prevent the disease. - Mod.TG].

Pet owners are encouraged to keep their dogs, cats, ferrets and horses vaccinated against rabies. If a pet is attacked, wash the pet's wound while wearing gloves, contact Animal Protection Services and contact a veterinarian.

https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/oneida-county-dog-exposed-to-bat-with-rabies-health-department-officials-say/ar-AAQ1JGG


A dog in Oneida County was exposed to a bat having tested positive for rabies Tuesday [26 Oct 2021], health department officials said.

The bat was collected from Whitestown and sent to the New York State Department of Health Wadsworth Center for testing on Monday [25 Oct 2021], according to a news release issued by the Oneida County Health Department.

No humans were exposed to the infected bat, health department officials said. The dog was current on rabies vaccinations and has received a rabies booster shot, according to the release.

Signs of rabies include:
- animal acting strangely
- animal acting mad
- animal acting shy -- the animal may get unusually close
- drooling or foaming from the mouth

Health Department officials recommend staying away from animals, wild or stray, with these signs. If any animal is acting strangely, contact a local animal control officer for help.

In 2020, 14 animals -- 4 bats, 1 cat, 1 dog, 2 skunks, 5 raccoons and 1 fox -- tested positive for rabies in Onondaga County; there were no human cases of rabies in Onondaga County in 2020.

Health Department Officials recommend all cats, dogs and ferrets 3 months and older have current rabies vaccinations, even if they stay indoors. Dogs and cats must receive a rabies vaccination at 3 months old, 1 year and then once every 3 years. Ferrets must receive a rabies vaccination every year.

For more information on rabies prevention, contact the Oneida County Health Department.

[7] South Carolina (Richland and Fairfield counties): fox, dogs, human exposure
Date: Wed 3 Nov 2021

https://www.coladaily.com/communities/blythewood/one-person-three-pets-exposed-to-rabid-fox-found-in-blythewood/article_5efeff88-3cdb-11ec-9459-abc038bcf12f.html


The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) confirmed on Wednesday afternoon [3 Nov 2021] that a fox found near Brunner Circle and High Pointe Drive in Blythewood has tested positive for rabies. Three dogs were exposed and will be quarantined as required in the SC Rabies Control Act, and one person was also potentially exposed and has been referred to their health care provider.

The fox was submitted to DHEC's laboratory for testing Monday [1 Nov 2021] and was confirmed to have rabies Tuesday [2 Nov 2021].

"To reduce the risk of getting rabies, always give wild and stray animals plenty of space," said Terri McCollister, Rabies Program team leader. "If you see an animal in need, avoid touching it and contact someone trained in handling animals, such as your local animal control officer, wildlife control operator, or wildlife rehabilitator." An exposure is defined as direct contact (such as through broken skin or mucous membranes in the eyes, nose, or mouth) with saliva or brain/nervous system tissue from an infected animal. If your pet is found with wounds of unknown origin, please consider that your pet may have been exposed to rabies.

DHEC advises anyone who may have come into contact or whose pets may have come in contact with the fox, or another animal that potentially has rabies to call DHEC's Environmental Affairs Columbia office during normal business hours (8:30 a.m.-5:00 p.m., Monday-Friday) or after hours and on holidays at the after-hours number.

Officials reminded the public to keep pets up to date on their rabies vaccinations, which is one of the easiest and most effective ways to protect against the disease.

The fox is the 10th animal in Richland County to test positive for rabies in 2021. There have been 84 cases of rabid animals statewide this year. South Carolina has averaged approximately 148 positive cases a year since 2002. Eight of the 168 confirmed rabies cases in South Carolina were in Richland County last year [2020].

A horse in Perth South has tested positive for rabies. Officials with Huron Perth Public Health say the horse in the Blanshard Ward is the 3rd animal to test positive in our region this year [2021] with the first 2 cases found in bats.

The virus can be found in the saliva of infected mammals, and it's assumed the infected horse was in contact with a rabid wild animal, such as a skunk or fox. The health unit is working with the farm owner on this investigation and at this time, 6 individuals have received [post-exposure] rabies medication.

The Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Affairs is also working closely with the farm owner to implement a precautionary confinement period for the other animals possibly having been in close contact with the infected animal.

[This rabies update has some unusual reports we should take seriously.

Fortunately, we do not often see a case of human rabies. However, in this report there are 2 cases of human rabies. Authorities in both cases are very confidential about the circumstances surrounding these situations in sections [1] and [3]. Without treatment, a human bitten by a rabid animal will die. There are fewer than a handful of cases when treatment has been attempted and the individual has survived. However, those individuals have continual issues and have not been able to return to a normal life.

Individuals being exposed to a rabid animal or an animal suspected of rabies, either through a bite or a scratch, should wash the wound immediately with soap and water and seek medical attention and likely be treated with post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). More about this in a moment.

Sadly, in both cases the rabid animal was a bat. Bats are reportedly able to bite a sleeping person without awakening them. Hence, keeping your home free of bats and keeping it in good repair to prevent bats getting into the dwelling can be very important.

While each of these cases in this report represents an interruption in human and animal life, each report serves as a reminder to be vigilant regarding our surroundings and keeping our pets up to date with vaccines. To this point, I would like to call out the last article, section [8] above.

I have noted on numerous occasions the need to vaccinate horses. Horses often are regarded as pets. These equine pets come in all sizes from the mini horses to large draft breeds of horses. However, without proper and regular vaccination against rabies, these animals are susceptible to the disease, putting us in substantial danger. Yes, more danger than our ordinary time with our equine friends. Rabid horses can be more unpredictable than usual and "explode" with unanticipated viciousness and are quite capable of killing us. While accidents can happen and injury or death can happen from any equine interaction, the unexpected viciousness of a rabid horse attack is exceedingly unsettling.

My plea to you is to make sure your pets' vaccinations are current, and accurate, regardless of the size or species of your mammalian pet. Protect your pet, yourself and your neighbors and friends. Be kind -- vaccinate.

More about rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP):
"Rabies is a fatal but preventable viral disease. It can spread to people and pets if they are bitten or scratched by a rabid animal. In the United States, rabies is mostly found in wild animals like bats, raccoons, skunks, and foxes [and other unvaccinated animals, feral dogs and cats]. However, in many other countries dogs still carry rabies, and most rabies deaths in people around the world are caused by dog bites.

"The rabies virus infects the central nervous system. If a person does not receive the appropriate medical care after a potential rabies exposure, the virus can cause disease in the brain, ultimately resulting in death. Rabies can be prevented by vaccinating pets, staying away from wildlife, and seeking medical care after potential exposures before symptoms start" (https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/index.html).

If you have been a bite victim of an animal possibly having rabies, you should consult your physician right away. You may need wound care but also advice on PEP. If you have had a bite or scratch from an animal having tested positive for rabies, work with your physician for PEP.

"In the United States, PEP consists of a regimen of one dose of immune globulin and 4 doses of rabies vaccine over a 14-day period. Rabies immune globulin and the 1st dose of rabies vaccine should be given by your healthcare provider as soon as possible after exposure. Current vaccines are relatively painless and are given in your arm like a flu or tetanus vaccine; rabies vaccines are not given in the stomach" (https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/exposure/index.html).

"Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) consists of a dose of human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) and rabies vaccine given on the day of the rabies exposure, and then a dose of vaccine given again on days 3, 7, and 14. For people who have never been vaccinated against rabies previously, PEP should always include administration of both HRIG and rabies vaccine. The combination of HRIG and vaccine is recommended for both bite and non-bite exposures, regardless of the interval between exposure and initiation of treatment.

"People who have been previously vaccinated or are receiving preexposure vaccination for rabies should receive only vaccine.

"Adverse reactions to rabies vaccine and immune globulin are not common. Newer vaccines in use today cause fewer adverse reactions than previously available vaccines. Mild, local reactions to the rabies vaccine, such as pain, redness, swelling, or itching at the injection site, have been reported. Rarely, symptoms such as headache, nausea, abdominal pain, muscle aches, and dizziness have been reported. Local pain and low-grade fever may follow injection of rabies immune globulin.

"The vaccine should be given at recommended intervals for best results. Talk to your doctor or state or local public health officials if you will not be able to have your shots at the recommended interval. Rabies prevention is a serious matter, and changes should not be made in the schedule of doses. Patient assistance programs that provide medications to uninsured or underinsured patients are available for rabies vaccine and immune globulin.

"People cannot transmit rabies to other people unless they themselves are sick with rabies. PEP will protect you from developing rabies, and therefore you cannot expose other people to rabies. You can continue to participate in your normal activities" (https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/medical_care/index.html).
