CDC says mumps outbreak continues in New York State
---------------------------------------------------
The Center for Disease Control [CDC] has issued a preliminary set of
data regarding mumps cases for 2010 in the United States. The data
[are] the latest available. However, the figures are unofficial and
will not be certified by the public health officials of various
states or the CDC until next year [2011], the Rochester Infectious
Disease Examiner reports.

The data provided cover the 1st 25 weeks of 2010, through 26 Jun
2010. According to the data, New York City's mumps outbreak
continues, though the number of new mumps cases in upstate New York
and New Jersey appears to have declined. Preliminary numbers indicate
that New York City has reported 927 cases of mumps in 2010 through 26
Jun 2010. Upstate New York has reported 644 cases, with an additional
257 reported in New Jersey, the Rochester Infectious Disease Examiner
reports. The CDC has had reports of 2106 cases of mumps nationwide,
with 87 percent of those from New York and New Jersey.

"Mumps vaccine, which is included in the combination
measles-mumps-rubella and measles-mumps-rubella-varicella vaccines,
is the best way to prevent mumps," the CDC told the Rochester
Infectious Disease Examiner. "Mumps vaccine effectiveness has been
estimated at 62 to 91 percent for one dose and 76 to 95 percent for 2 doses."

[Before routine vaccination was introduced in the United States,
mumps was a common illness in infants, children and young adults.
Because most people have now been vaccinated, mumps has become a rare
disease in the United States. However, as indicated above, at least 2
doses of vaccine are required to achieve an adequate level of
immunity, Consequently there will always be a proportion of the
population with inadequate protection in the event of reintroduction
of mumps virus into the community.
