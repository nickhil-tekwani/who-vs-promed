The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is investigating cases of non-tuberculosis mycobacterial infection associated with tattooing. If you are aware of a case of tattoo-associated non-tuberculosis (atypical) mycobacterial skin infection diagnosed between May 2011 and February 2012 in the USA, please contact Duc Nguyen, Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion, CDC via email (<vif8@cdc.gov>) or phone (404-639-0027).

[According to an email from Dr Nguyen, the original cases were infected with _Mycobacterium chelonae_ but they are interested in other non-tuberculosis mycobacteria as well, including other species such as _M. abscessus_ and _M. bolletii_.

The following is extracted from a previous ProMED-mail posting (Non-tuberculous mycobacterium, nosocomial - China (02): background 20100128.0308 ) regarding past outbreaks of these ubiquitous non-tuberculous mycobacteria related to nosocomial and cosmetic procedures reported in the USA:

- 1987: an outbreak (17 cases) of _M. chelonae_ otitis media was caused by contaminated water used by an ENT [ear, nose, throat] practice in Louisiana.
- 1988: an outbreak (8 cases) of foot infections due to _M. chelonae_ subspecies _abscessus_ infections were associated with a jet injector used in a podiatric office.
- 1991 (publication year): an outbreak (6 cases) of _M. fortuitum_ infection in Washington was associated with contaminated electromyography needles.
- 1995 to 1996: an outbreak (87 cases) of post injection abscesses due to _M. abscessus_ in several states was ascribed to an adrenal cortex extract.
- 1999: an outbreak (10 cases) of intra- and periarticular _M. abscessus_ infection in Texas was caused by contaminated benzalkonium chloride used for injection.
- 2000 to 2001: an outbreak (110 cases) of skin infections !due to _M. fortuitum_ was caused by contaminated footbaths in California nail salons.
- 2002: an outbreak (14 confirmed and 11 suspected cases) of soft tissue infections due to _M. abscessus_ followed injections of cosmetic substances administered by unlicensed practitioners in New York City.
- 2002: an outbreak (115 cases or more) of cutaneous infection by _M. fortuitum_ was associated with a contaminated footbath in a nail salon in California.
- 2002 (publication year): an outbreak (34 cases) of _M. chelonae_ soft tissue infection in California was associated with liposuction.
- 2002 to 2003: an outbreak (4 cases) of _M. chelonae_ infection among patients undergoing rhytidectomies [facelift] in New Jersey was caused by a contaminated methylene blue solution.
- 2003: an outbreak (3 cases) of _Mycobacterium goodii_ infection was associated with surgical implants in a Colorado hospital.
- 2004: an outbreak (12 cases) among Americans of soft tissue infections caused by _M. abscessus_ following cosmetic surgery performed at various clinics in the Dominican Republic.
- 2009 (publication year): an outbreak (6 cases) of _M. chelonae_ infection was associated with a tattoo establishment. - Mod.LL
