Wildlife rabies alert: El Tambo
-------------------------------
The livestock sector in El Tambo [Cauca
Department] issued an alert on wildlife rabies
cases. Vaccination is the only alternative for prevention.

A total of 4 cases of wildlife rabies were
identified by the ICA [Instituto Colombiano
Agropecuario -- Colombian Agricultural Institute]
in the villages of El Pedregal, Las Juntas,
Marcon, and San Joaquin in the municipality of El
Tambo. Among the causes of the bovine disease is
the lack of vaccination by some farmers.

The 1st case of this disease, caused by a virus
transmitted by foxes, dogs, and mainly by
hematophagous [blood-sucking] bats was recorded
on 23 Apr 2010, a month before the beginning of
the 1st cycle of FMD vaccination by the Cauca Livestock Committee.

"With the 1st report, we could increase
vaccination against wildlife rabies in the El
Tambo municipality. More than 2500 doses [of
vaccine] to counteract the virus, subsidized by
the Office of the Mayor, were distributed in the
area," said the manager of the Livestock
Committee, Luis Jaime Paz. The vaccine costs, on
average 1500 pesos [approx. USD 0.83]

Marco Andres Diaz, ICA veterinarian, said that
the concern here is that the rural communities,
not only in this municipality, but in Cauca in
general, do not participate in the vaccination
campaign until the disease spreads.

"El Tambo, has positive reports of wildlife
rabies from 2003 and farmers began vaccination in
the following months but then discontinued it
(...) and the only way to avoid this disease is
through vaccination," added Diaz, who also
reported that they were running advanced training
sessions aimed at identifying and managing cases
of wildlife rabies, as well as the procedure for biological control among bats.

Margaret Maria Duque Rodriguez, the ICA director,
said that on Friday [27 Aug 2010] a council on
zoonoses with the Departmental Secretariat of
Health is scheduled and they will define the
preventive actions to be taken to treat
individuals who have had direct contact with [the
affected] animals. Also, they recommended that
all cases of rabies in wildlife should be
reported, as this is a way to control and
implement measures against the disease.

Signs of wildlife rabies
------------------------
Affected animals show changes in behavior, loss
of hind limbs (stiffness), abundant salivation,
red and bulging eyes, blindness, prostration,
muscle tremors, lack of defecation and
rumination, and progressive emaciation related to
dehydration; at the end they remain down due to
paralysis and die between 1 and 10 days after the onset of symptoms.

Wildlife rabies is a fatal disease caused by a
virus that attacks the central nervous system and
is transmitted mainly by hematophagous
[blood-sucking] or vampire bats and affects all
warm-blooded animals, among them cattle, horses,
pigs, sheep, goats, and finally man.

Currently, in the El Tambo municipality City
Hall, there are subsidized vaccine doses for the
livestock sector in the area, in order to extend
the vaccination process and prevent these
diseases. The vaccine costs about 1500 pesos [approx. USD 0.83].

[The best buffer of protection between rabies in
wild animals and yourself is vaccination of
domestic animals, including cattle. Furthermore
vaccination of cattle is much cheaper than the
loss of a production animal. - Mod.TG]
