British scientists discovered a link between the El Nino weather phenomenon
and deadly horse epidemics in South Africa. In a report in the science
journal Nature, researchers from the Institute of Animal Health showed that
climate changes resulting from El Nino caused a population explosion of the
biting midge, the insect that spreads African horse sickness (AHS).
The researchers analyzed meteorological patterns and records of the horse
epidemics, known as epizootics, dating back to 1803. Thirteen of the 14 AHS
outbreaks coincided with El Nino. The scientists believe a spell of drought
followed by heavy rainfall alters the breeding sites and increases the
populations of the biting midge.
They warned that the increasing frequency of El Nino, a warming of the
eastern tropical Pacific waters which causes havoc with weather systems,
could result in an increase in other diseases spread by flying insects,
including those that affect humans.
``Now we have established this link between El Nino and AHS, there is real
concern about other important insect-borne diseases that may be similarly
influenced,'' Dr Philip Mellor said in a statement. "El Nino used to occur
every five years, now it's every three. If this becomes an annual event we
may see a serious escalation in epidemics worldwide,'' he warned.
