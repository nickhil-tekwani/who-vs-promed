At least 2 and possibly 3 prairie dog colonies have been wiped out by
bubonic plague on Schriever Air Force Base, about 10 miles east of
Colorado Springs. No human cases have been reported.
Air Force personnel along with officials from the El Paso County
Health Department confirmed Tuesday [24 Jul 2007] that 2 of 5
colonies are infected.
Base spokesman Ed Parsons said Wednesday [25 Jul 2007] that a 3rd
colony is suspected to contain the plague. A 4th colony was cleared,
and a 5th colony was not tested because of its remote location, Parsons said.
"We've not had a die-off like this before," Parsons said, noting that
most of the prairie dogs in the 2 infected colonies have died.
Parsons said the base suspected a problem when the prairie dog
population started to decline. "It was pretty obvious that we had
lost a lot of prairie dogs."
Health officials tested the colonies last week and confirmed that
plague had been found.
"It's a large die-off of critters, but we have no human cases yet,
and we want to keep it that way," said Rick Miklich, director of
environmental health for the El Paso County Health Department.
"We went out there and harvested a large amount of fleas that are
looking for someplace to go. We found the plague in them. It's the
fleas we're worried about, not the prairie dogs, which are just a
host. The infected fleas can move to other hosts, like dogs, cats and people."
Miklich said bubonic-plague germs are endemic to the West. "The
plague is here all the time. It can remain dormant or flare up into
an outbreak. What causes that we don't know. What we worry about are
the fleas moving. This is a large outbreak. But it's not the 1st time
it's happened. Off the top of my head, the last outbreak this large
was several years ago," he said.
Parsons said the Air Force has closed the infected areas, advising
personnel to avoid dead prairie dogs and on what to do if they
develop flu-like symptoms. The colonies are somewhat remote from base
personnel, but one is near a path frequented by joggers, he said. The
colonies are being dusted with insecticide to kill the fleas.
Miklich cautioned residents to avoid prairie dog colonies, at least
for the rest of the summer, and not to let their pets run loose near
the colonies.

[This article wisely points out that the prairie dog is the
host-victim, while the fleas are the real problem. Prairie dogs are
considered sentinels for plague.
It is good to see them dusting the area for fleas and providing flea
relief to the prairie dogs. Prairie dog colonies are fascinating and
entertaining to watch. Certainly, it is that interaction that prompts
the concern.
