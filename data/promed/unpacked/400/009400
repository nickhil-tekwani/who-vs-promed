Suzanne Smith of the Audubon Aquarium of the Americas is also a part of the Louisiana Marine Mammal and Sea Turtle Rescue Program. Just last week alone [week of 15 Jan 2012], she conducted necropsies on 3 dead dolphins found near Grand Isle. "We're finding, unfortunately, more dead dolphins than we normally would," Smith said. "So, the testing on the necropsies has gotten very strict and we are taking duplicate and triplicate samples on all parts, externally and internally on these animals, to try and find out what is happening out in the wild population."

Since the beginning of the month [January 2012], 14 marine mammals, including a dozen dolphins, have been found along the northern Gulf of Mexico. Half of the dead dolphins washed up on the Louisiana coast.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) calls it an "Unusual Mortality Event" in the northern Gulf and next month [February 2012] will mark 2 years since it began. The tally so far: 630 dead.

The event started in February 2010 -- 2 months before the oil spill began. Still, the deaths raise a red flag with the Gulf Restoration Network.

"The ongoing deaths of these dolphins speaks to the idea that we haven't seen all of the impacts from the BP oil drilling disaster end yet," said Dan Favre of the Gulf Restoration Network.

Since there is an ongoing investigation and litigation involving the BP spill, Smith and other scientists are not allowed to reveal what they have found in the necropsies. Last fall [2011], NOAA said some of the dead dolphins showed signs of a [bacterium] called _Brucella_. What role, if any, the oil spill may have played with the immune systems of the dead dolphins is still not clear and neither is when the strandings may finally stop.

"I hope we don't see anything more, but I would say we still have a little more time where we're going to be on the edge of our seat in seeing what might actually happen in the future," Favre said.

All of this comes as a federal trial is scheduled for 27 Feb 2012, related to liability in the oil spill and spanning multiple jurisdictions and claims. That trial, considered the 1st of 3 trial phases, will focus on what caused the blowout and spill.

[Anything that causes a severe disruption of the natural processes that govern an ecosystem has the potential to alter the dynamics of health of its animal community. However, the determinants of an alleged ecosystem health problem behind this unusual mortality event would be very difficult to elucidate. Unusual mortality events in marine wildlife have also been recently reported both in the east and the west coast of North America (see for example ProMED-mail posts 20111014.3074 and 20111027.3203). An integration of perspectives of different scale (that is, local, regional, global) might prove important to understand these kind of events.

Brucellosis is a globally distributed zoonotic disease of mammals that is pathogenic for the reticuloendothelial, reproductive, musculoskeletal and cutaneous systems. The aetiologic agent is a Gram negative, facultative intracellular bacterium of the genus _Brucella_. In marine mammals, it is an emerging infectious disease. From the 1990s onward, previously unknown strains of _Brucella_ were detected in free-ranging pinnipeds and cetaceans from the around the world. Brucellae isolated from cetaceans constitute 2 species with different preferred hosts, that is, _B. phocoenidae_ in porpoises and _B. delphini_ in dolphins.

Pathogenic findings associated with brucellosis in cetaceans include placentitis, orchitis, abortion, mastitis, pneumonia, subcutaneous lesions, arthritis, non-suppurative meningoencephalitis, and encephalitis. Brucella-induced neurologic disorders may lead to strandings. The role of environmental factors in the emergence of marine mammal brucellosis is unknown.

Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease. To date there are 4 known cases of humans infected with _Brucella_ spp. from marine mammals.

[Brucellosis infections of land animals have been well described as zoonoses. Starting in the 1990s, isolation of brucellae began to be made from marine mammals, particularly dolphins and seals. In 2007, formal recognition of _B. ceti_ (primarily from dolphins and porpoises) and _B. pinnipedialis_ (primarily from seals) were published (1). Zoonoses from these species have also been reported (2). Of the 4 reports, one was related to a laboratory exposure and in the other 3 there was no direct contact with the mammals but rather ingestion of raw fish or raw shellfish. [However, all 3 strains were of the Pacific bottlenosed dolphin ST27 genotype. - Mod JW]
