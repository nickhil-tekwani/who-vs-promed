Gujarat reported 4 cases of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) this year [2020]. Of them, 3 cases have been reported to the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) as part of the "weekly outbreak" reports; however, the state health department claimed there had been "no outbreak of CCHF this year [2020]".

The 1st case was reported on 4 Mar 2020: a 70-year-old patient from the Paliyad village in Bota. The patient's sample was sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune and came back positive.

Botad then reported a 2nd case in May [2020] from Gadhada block. The patient was a 35-year-old man from the cattle-grazing community of Maldharis and had visited a community health centre after showing symptoms of fever, reported The Indian Express. His samples were also sent to NIV Pune; however, he succumbed in 4 days.

The report was received after his death, and the deceased had tested positive. As per the NCDC report, the patient was suspected to have contracted the disease from the tick insecticide sprayed in a cattle shed.

The 3rd case of a 32-year-old male was recorded positive on July-end [2020] from Gadhada block of the area, and another one in March [2020]. All 3 cases were sent to Bhavnagar for treatment. The one fatality was reported from Botad.

This year [2020], there are fewer cases than reported last year [2019] when 35 CCHF cases and 17 deaths were reported. However, the project officer in the state health department denied reports and told the media that this year [2020], no outbreak of CCHF has been reported because of proactive administrative work. Last year [2019], the state reported 30 suspected cases of CCHF. The administration was on high alert, considering the fact that the disease has a high mortality rate of 40%.

Gujarat had its 1st reported cases of Congo fever in 2011; according to the World Health Organisation, that was the 1st documented case in the country.

[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a tick-borne viral disease that causes an often fatal hemorrhagic illness in humans. This disease is asymptomatic in animals. In WHO South East Asia region, the 1st laboratory-confirmed CCHF case was reported on 19 Jan 2011 in Gujarat state of India bordering with Pakistan (http://origin.searo.who.int/entity/emerging_diseases/links/CCHF_Fact_Sheet_SEARO.pdf). CCHF was first confirmed in a nosocomial outbreak in 2011 in Gujarat state (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25229708).

Healthcare workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed CCHF, or handling specimens from them, should implement standard infection-control precautions. These include basic hand hygiene, use of personal protective equipment, safe injection practices, and safe burial practices (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/crimean-congo-haemorrhagic-fever/en/).

The following measures to reduce tick-to-human infection, animal-to-human transmission, and human-to-human transmission are recommended to reduce the risk of infection in people (https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/crimean-congo-haemorrhagic-fever):

Reducing the risk of tick-to-human transmission:
- Wear protective clothing (long sleeves, long trousers).
- Wear light-coloured clothing to allow easy detection of ticks on the clothes.
- Use approved acaricides (chemicals intended to kill ticks) on clothing.
- Use approved repellent on the skin and clothing.
- Regularly examine clothing and skin for ticks; if found, remove them safely.
- Seek to eliminate or control tick infestations on animals or in stables and barns.
- Avoid areas where ticks are abundant and seasons when they are most active.

Reducing the risk of animal-to-human transmission:
- Wear gloves and other protective clothing while handling animals or their tissues in endemic areas, notably during slaughtering, butchering, and culling procedures in slaughterhouses or at home.
- Quarantine animals before they enter slaughterhouses or routinely treat animals with pesticides 2 weeks prior to slaughter.

Reducing the risk of human-to-human transmission in the community:
- Avoid close physical contact with CCHF-infected people.
- Wear gloves and protective equipment when taking care of ill people.
- Wash hands regularly after caring for or visiting ill people.
