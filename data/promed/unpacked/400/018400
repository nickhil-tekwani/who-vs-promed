The Loreto Regional Health Office (DIRESA) confirmed today [16 Nov
2011] the death of a youth due to [a] hantavirus [infection], the 3rd
that has been registered in the city of Iquitos, capital of this
jurisdiction in the northern forest of the country. Carlos Alvarez
Antonio, Director of the Epidemiology Office of the Loreto DIRESA,
stated that the victim is a young man 18 years of age, who died in the
Loreto Regional Hospital.

"(The patient) came to the hospital this past Thursday [10 Nov 2011]
from the Indiana locality, located an hour's trip from Iquitos by
boat, with a severe respiratory disease that was originally thought to
be pneumonia," said Alvarez. The blood sample from the young man,
however, was positive for [a] hantavirus transmitted by mice and rats
[found in the] countryside through their urine and feces, explained a
specialist in the Agencia Andina.

Given the new case, the DIRESA called for the Iquitos populace to
adopt measures concerning adequate cleanliness in their houses in
order to avoid entry of rodents, and also to use masks while cleaning
areas that have been closed for a long time.

They recalled that the 1st 2 [fatal] cases of hantavirus fatalities
were registered in July and August [2011]. These were 2 women aged 29
and 31 years, respectively.

[A 3rd case of a hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) infection in a
nurse, who recovered, was reported earlier on 8 Sep 2011 (see
ProMED-mail archive no. 20110924.2900). Unless a hantavirus infection
was subsequently ruled out in that case, the above individual would be
the 4th hantavirus in Loreto but the 3rd fatality due to HPS.

The hantavirus involved in this case is not specified. A hantavirus
that causes HPS (hantavirus pulmonary syndrome) that is found in the
Amazon Basin is Araraquara and its rodent host is (_Necromys (Bolomys)
benefactus_).
