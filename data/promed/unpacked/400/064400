The number of people infected in Uganda's Ebola Sudan outbreak jumped to 50 today [29 Sep 2022], with 14 more cases added to the total, the World Health Organization (WHO) African region said today on Twitter. One more person died, raising the fatality count to 24.

Of the 14 new cases, 13 are lab-confirmed and one is listed as probable, bringing the case numbers to 31 confirmed and 19 probable. The death occurred in someone who had a lab-confirmed case, raising the fatality count to 6 confirmed and 18 probable.

The number of affected districts remains at 3: Mubende, Kassanda, and Kyegegwa. So far, no cases have been reported in the Kampala area.

Yesterday [28 Sep 2022] Uganda Health Minister Jane Ruth Aceng Ocero, MBChB, MPH, said a sample tested from a person from Kasangati, just north of Kampala, was negative for Ebola. She reiterated that no cases have been confirmed in Kampala, and she urged the public to remain calm and vigilant.

So far, health officials have identified 414 contacts, up 191 from 3 days ago [26 Sep 2022].

In a related development, WHO officials have been meeting since last week to assess the possibility of an Ebola Sudan vaccine trial could be launched in Uganda's outbreak, Stat reported (https://www.statnews.com/2022/09/29/ebola-experimental-vaccine-trial-may-begin-soon-in-uganda/) [see section that follows].

Ana Maria Henao Restrepo, MD, who leads the WHO drugs, diagnostics, and vaccine division, said a clinical trial could begin in as soon as a few weeks. Uganda health officials would need to clear the plan.

The Ebola Sudan vaccine furthest along in clinical trials and most likely to be tested in Uganda's outbreak is one developed by the Sabin Vaccine Institute. Stat said there are 6 candidate vaccines, but only 3 are in clinical trials. The Sabin Vaccine Institute said its Ebola Sudan candidate, using GSK's ChAD3 platform and given in one dose, has completed a phase 1B trial.

[2] Uganda: Ebola Sudan candidate vaccine

A clinical trial of one or perhaps 2 experimental vaccines designed to protect against the Ebola Sudan virus could soon begin in Uganda, as long as the country agrees to allow the research to take place, an official of the World Health Organization (WHO) said Wednesday [28 Sep 2022].

The trial could get underway within a couple of weeks and definitely before the end of October [2022], said Ana Maria Henao-Restrepo, who heads WHO's R&D Blueprint effort to develop drugs, diagnostics, and vaccines to respond to outbreaks of rare and dangerous pathogens.

Henao-Restrepo and her team in WHO's Health Emergencies Program have been meeting since last week to try to determine if any of the vaccines in development are far enough along to warrant testing in the fast-growing Ebola Sudan outbreak, which was first recognized early last week.

This is the 1st Ebola Sudan outbreak in a decade, presenting a rare opportunity to test a vaccine for this species of Ebola virus. Although Uganda announced the 1st confirmed case on 20 Sep 2022, the 1st case may date back to early August [2022]. There have already been at least 36 cases and 23 deaths.

"We are doing everything that you are supposed to do when you want to get a trial started in a week or 2 maximum," Henao-Restrepo said during a small briefing. Discussions have included the Ugandan government, which has nominated a principal investigator for the trial.

Henao-Restrepo said the government appears willing to allow the trial to proceed, but must still clear some internal hurdles, such as getting regulatory approval and agreement from an ethics review committee. "So we cannot say now that the trial will happen until we get the approvals," she said.

There are 2 licensed vaccines that protect against the Ebola Zaire species, but the Zaire and Sudan versions of these viruses are different enough from one another that those 2 vaccines -- made by Merck and Janssen, a division of Johnson & Johnson -- will not work against this virus.

Gary Kobinger, an Ebola expert who was involved in the early development of the Merck vaccine, applauded the efforts to use this opportunity to try to add an Ebola Sudan vaccine to the world's armamentarium against Ebola viruses.

"It is great to see WHO leading efforts to have a clinical study evaluating a...vaccine to protect against this deadly pathogen," Kobinger, who directs the Galveston National Laboratory at the University of Texas Medical Branch, said in an email.

"Many vaccine candidates have shown full protection in pre-clinical studies and fortunately this one candidate is available (tens of thousands of doses) in clinical grade quality. The rapid response from WHO to have this readiness is remarkable and [is] what I think is a positive result of what was learned from the 2014-16 Ebola outbreak in West Africa."

The vaccine Kobinger was referring to was the first that will be tested. It is being developed in a partnership between the Washington, DC-based Sabin Vaccine Institute and the Vaccine Research Center (VRC) at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. At present there are only 100 doses of the vaccine in ready-to-use format and they belong to the VRC.

"We are working with Uganda and WHO to determine the best way to use these doses in the current outbreak," Richard Koup, acting director of the VCR, told STAT in an email. "The Sabin Vaccine Institute has bulk drug substance for thousands of vaccine doses that must be vialed; they are currently working through the timeline for those activities."

There are 6 candidate vaccines, as experimental vaccines are called, that target Ebola Sudan. But only 3 have advanced to the stage where human clinical trials have begun.

In all 3 cases, the human trials have been the small initial trials that determine how much vaccine should be given in a dose. Those trials also generate enough safety and immunogenicity data to show that a candidate vaccine appears to be safe enough to proceed with testing, and provide enough evidence of potential benefit to pursue larger trials aimed at determining whether the vaccine actually works.

The vaccine that is furthest along is the Sabin Institute vaccine, Henao-Restrepo said. This vaccine, which uses an adenovirus that infects chimpanzees to deliver the Ebola Sudan glycoprotein to the immune system, was developed at the VRC and for a time was licensed by vaccine behemoth GSK.

Prior to the massive West African Ebola outbreak of 2014-2016, GSK was developing a number of vaccines for several Ebola species and for Marburg, a related virus. During that outbreak, a WHO-led clinical trial in Guinea showed that Merck's Ebola Zaire vaccine was effective, generating data that led to its licensure by the Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency.

A trial testing the GSK vaccine ended without conclusive results, however, because other control measures finally brought the outbreak to an end. GSK abandoned these vaccines after that outbreak and in 2019 the company donated the license for the vaccine candidates to the Sabin Institute.

A 2nd vaccine, being developed by scientists at the University of Oxford's Jenner Institute, may also be tested, if the outbreak continues long enough to get it into the field. That vaccine -- which was developed by the research group that designed AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine -- uses a different adenovirus, one that infects humans, to carry both the Ebola Sudan and Ebola Zaire glycoproteins into the body.

Both vaccines are designed as single-dose vaccines.

The trial design used in Guinea to test the Merck Ebola Zaire vaccine will be used in Uganda, Henao-Restrepo said. Rather than a standard randomized controlled trial, where volunteers are assigned to receive a vaccine or a placebo, this trial will employ a ring vaccination design. People who are contacts of known cases will be offered vaccine and will be monitored to see if they develop disease. The rings of contacts of some cases will be offered vaccine immediately, while others will be offered vaccine after a delay. If fewer infections arise among the contacts who are vaccinated quickly, the vaccine will be deemed to have worked.

In recent Ebola Zaire outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the DRC government, the WHO, and other response partners have used a method where they vaccinated contacts of cases and then the contacts of contacts. But this time only the 1st ring of contacts will be offered vaccine, Henao-Restropo said. "Our experience from DRC shows that this is where the transmission is," she said, noting that roughly 90% of the secondary transmission occurred among contacts of cases.

Given existing supplies of these vaccines, that is just as well. The WHO has been told the Sabin Institute has 40 000 doses of its vaccine in bulk form. Plans are underway to have the bulk vaccine processed into a ready-to-use format, a process known as fill and finish. Henao-Restrepo said the goal is to have that work done in October and November [2022].

There are 71 doses of the Oxford vaccine at present, she said, with the Serum Institute of India working to produce 20 000 more over the same time frame. "Governments on both sides of the Atlantic and their partners are working to try to accelerate this calendar. But it takes a few weeks to put bulk vaccine into vials," she said. The trial can begin with the 100 doses of the Sabin Institute's vaccine, Henao-Restrepo said, noting that is enough vaccine for 10 rings of contacts.

There is a 3rd vaccine that could be tested, a 2-dose vaccine developed by Janssen. There are 3500 vials of that vaccine, but the company put the development project on hold. Henao-Restrepo said the company said it would review the situation and consider whether it wants the candidate to be added to the mix of those being tested.

It seems likely some or all of these vaccines will work; testing done in non-human primates, the best model for human Ebola infection, showed nearly all the animals were protected.

But all 3 use adenoviruses as a means of introducing the virus to be protected against -- Ebola Sudan -- to the immune system. And experience with COVID vaccines suggests there may be problems with adenovirus vaccine platforms. Both the AstraZeneca and the Janssen vaccines were associated with a rare but serious side effect, which involved dangerous clotting and bleeding. A number of recipients of these vaccines died.

Henao-Restrepo said that issue is in the mix in discussions about testing these vaccines, but she noted that the risk-benefit ratio here is different. Ebola Zaire has a high fatality rate -- 64% so far in this outbreak. Also, the clotting problems associated with the AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines were even rarer in Africa than elsewhere, she said, noting if the trials proceed there will be a strong surveillance effort to monitor for adverse events.

[Three vaccines against Ebola Sudan have reached clinical trial and at least one that looks promising is available in clinical grade quality. This one is produced by the Sabin Vaccine Institute and the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; it uses a chimpanzee adenovirus (GSK's ChAD3 platform) to deliver the Ebola Sudan glycoprotein to the immune system. Such vectors have been successful, but also may demonstrate problematic side effects. A vaccine would be an extremely efficient approach to controlling virus spread if it were protective against Ebola Sudan infection and did not have adverse side effects.

[3] Congo DR (North Kivu): End of outbreak
Date: Thu 29 Sep 2022

Situation at a glance
---------------------
On 27 Sep 2022, the Ministry of Health (MoH) of the Democratic Republic of Congo declared the end of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak that affected Butanuka health area, Beni health zone, North Kivu province. In accordance with WHO recommendations, the declaration was made 42 days (twice the maximum incubation period for Ebola virus infections) after the burial of the last and only confirmed case.

Description of the outbreak
---------------------------
On 21 Aug 2022, the MoH of the Democratic Republic of Congo declared an Ebola outbreak following laboratory confirmation via reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of Ebola virus in a fatal case in Beni health zone, North Kivu province.

The case was a 46-year-old woman hospitalized and treated from 23 Jul to 15 Aug 2022 (23 days) for symptoms that included cough, headache, polyarthralgia (joint pain), and physical asthenia (general fatigue), thought to be related to her known co-morbidities. The patient died in hospital on 15 Aug 2022. The body was returned to the family and buried in a traditional manner on 16 Aug 2022 prior to receipt of the laboratory results.

Samples of blood and oropharyngeal secretions tested positive for Zaire ebolavirus by RT-PCR at the National Institute for Biomedical Research in Beni (INRB) on 15 Aug 2022 and these were confirmed at Rodolphe Mérieux INRB Laboratory in Goma on 16 Aug 2022. The outbreak was declared by the MoH following EVD confirmation testing and genetic sequencing.

No additional confirmed or probable cases have been identified since 16 Aug 2022. Of the 182 contacts of the case, 172 were identified and monitored for 21 days. The 10 contacts who were not followed up were unable to be reached. Investigations are still ongoing to determine the source of the outbreak.

Public health response
----------------------
Overall response: The MoH, together with WHO and other partners, conducted response measures to control the outbreak and prevent further spread. National and district emergency management committees were activated to coordinate the response. Multidisciplinary teams were deployed to actively search and provide care for cases; identify, reach and follow-up contacts; and sensitize communities on outbreak prevention and control interventions.

Alerts and testing: During this outbreak, from 21 Aug to 27 Sep 2022, a total of 9173 alerts were reported from Beni health zone, and all (100%) were investigated, including 607 (7%) validated as suspected cases of EVD. A total of 682 samples were tested for EVD.

Points of entry: A total of 2390 (92%) of 2608 travelers registered at points of entry were screened for EVD, and no alerts were detected.

Vaccination: As of 27 Sep 2022, 550 persons in the affected health zone have been vaccinated against EVD using the ring strategy, targeting contacts and contacts of contact. Frontline healthcare workers made up the majority of those vaccinated (483).

WHO risk assessment
-------------------
This latest EVD outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo is declared over, with no new cases reported for 42 days after the burial of the last and only confirmed case on 16 Aug 2022. This case is genetically linked to the 2018-2020 outbreak in North Kivu, Ituri and South Kivu provinces. (For more information on this outbreak, please see the WHO outbreak account related to the 2018-2020 event). The source of this most recent outbreak has not yet been identified.

A future outbreak is not unexpected given that EVD is endemic in the country. Ebola virus is enzootic and a resurgence from viral persistence in survivors described in recent epidemics. Re-emergence of EVD is a major public health concern in the Democratic Republic of Congo; gaps remain in the country's capacity to recover, prepare for, and respond to outbreaks. The concurrent outbreaks in the country (COVID-19, cholera, measles, polio, yellow fever, monkeypox, etc.) as well as the protracted humanitarian situation in the eastern part of the country have put increasing pressure on the health system and the available resources.

A confluence of environmental and socioeconomic factors -- including community mistrust, weak health systems, and political instability -- in some specific areas such as North Kivu province can increase the risk for new outbreaks of EVD. Moreover, improved capacities in detection, laboratory confirmation and increased surveillance may explain the increased frequency in detecting EVD outbreaks. Nevertheless, WHO is concerned that ongoing challenges regarding insecurity as well as health system challenges (epidemiological surveillance, IPC programmes and practices in healthcare settings), coupled with the emergence of COVID-19 and other ongoing outbreaks, may jeopardize the country's ability to rapidly detect and respond to any re-emergence.

WHO advice
----------
WHO advises the following risk reduction measures as an effective way to reduce EVD transmission in humans:

- Reduce the risk of wildlife-to-human transmission from contact with infected fruit bats or non-human primates and the consumption of their raw meat. Animals should be handled with gloves and other appropriate protective clothing.

- Reduce the risk of human-to-human transmission from direct or close contact with people with Ebola symptoms, particularly with their bodily fluids. Appropriate personal protective equipment should be worn when taking care of ill patients. Regular hand washing is required after visiting patients in hospital, as well as after touching or coming into contact with any body fluids.

- Continue training and retraining of health personnel for early detection, isolation and treatment of EVD cases as well as retraining on safe and dignified burials.

- Reduce the risk of possible transmission from virus persistence in some body fluids of survivors. WHO recommends providing medical care, psychological support and biological testing (until 2 consecutive negative tests) through an EVD survivors care programme. WHO does not recommend isolation of male or female convalescent patients whose blood has been tested negative for the Ebola virus.

- Reduce amplification of transmission through health care by strengthening IPC programmes within the healthcare system.

- Provide ongoing training of the health workforce for early detection, isolation, and treatment of EVD cases as well as re-training on safe and dignified burials and the IPC ring approach.

- Engage with communities to reinforce safe and dignified burial practices.

- Build and maintain capacities for logistic support in at-risk areas or countries.

Based on the current risk assessment and prior evidence on Ebola outbreaks, WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to the Democratic Republic of Congo.
