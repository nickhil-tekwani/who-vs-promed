Avian influenza of high pathogenicity (H5N1, H5N2, and H5N9) and low pathogenicity (H5N2, H5N3) in poultry in France. Ref: VITT/1200 LPAI & HPAI in France
---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Disease report
Since the last update on 16 Dec 2015, more outbreaks in poultry have been reported as a result of increased surveillance in south west France (for the official map, updated 23 Dec 2015, see the source URL; not all outbreaks visible at this scale). To date, there are 61 outbreaks of HPAI H5 (N1, N2 and N9), 54 of which have been reported to the EU Animal Disease Notification System. Six regions are affected: Dordogne (12 outbreaks); Landes (27 outbreaks); Haute Vienne (1); Gers (9); Pyrenees Atlantique (10) and; Haute Pyrenees (2). [For the 24 Dec 2015 updated figures, see commentary].

The situation continues to evolve, and the French authorities have increased the size of restriction zones to cover more regions (hatched/grey area in map), and this has been adopted by the European Commission under special written procedure (SANTE/7135/2015). Movements of live birds from any control zone are subject to pre-movement testing, which has led to the detection of more infected flocks, but does provide some additional assurance (http://agriculture.gouv.fr/la-liste-des-communes-de-la-zone-reglementee-influenza-aviaire).

2. Situation assessment
ANSES [Agence nationale de securite sanitaire de l'alimentation, de l'environnement et du travail; French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety], the French risk assessment agency, has published an assessment of the likely source of infection, limited partial virus gene sequence data, risk to public health, and relevance of restriction measures (https://www.anses.fr/fr/system/files/SANT2015sa0241.pdf).

The source considered most likely is that LPAI European origin avian influenza viruses were circulating in poultry and have mutated to HPAI, then silent spread has occurred in species which show few clinical signs (Anseriforme poultry) or which have been partially immunised by exposure to related LPAI viruses. This theory is given greater confidence by the knowledge that these LPAI viruses are often detected year after year in this area through the EU poultry survey. The preliminary sequence data suggest that there is a common H5 sequence to the LP/HPAI viruses.

A less likely theory is that multiple LPAI viruses were circulating recently in wild birds, and then, after contact with the poultry, these viruses mutated. It is considered very unlikely that the HPAI viruses were circulating in wild birds, as there have been no reports of such in EU-wide surveys.

On the restriction measures, there is still some uncertainty around how the viruses are spread from one location to another given the significant increase in recent days of new infected premises, hence the large zone now in place.

On the public health risk, it is noted that only Eurasian strains of H5N1 HPAI have caused human disease (and derived from a different gene lineage to the viruses involved in the current outbreaks), and even so only for people in very close contact with poultry (during home slaughter for example), and no cases have been associated with H5N2 or H5N9 HPAI infection in poultry. See also ECDC (2015) [at http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/_layouts/forms/Publication_DispForm.aspx?List=4f55ad51-4aed-4d32-b960-af70113dbb90&ID=1411].

Nevertheless, the full gene sequences for a multiple number of viruses will need to be determined and analysed before clear conclusions on pathways of origin, length of time the virus has been evolving in the field and implications for zoonotic risk can be concluded, as there may still be re-assortments or genetic adaptation occurring.

Based on limited sequencing for just 3 viruses, the authors concluded there are a number of previously identified mutations which may promote the replication of the virus in the mammalian respiratory tract, but the combination of all these mutations in affecting host range is complex. Infection with any AI virus in particular circumstances of high exposure (such as those operatives in the field who are involved in control measures) cannot be ruled out.

It should be noted that understanding how widely LPAI viruses are circulating in poultry is important, as this could present a substantially immune population and needs to be considered in control decisions and surveillance design.

It would be helpful to understand more about the way the "feeding" duck and geese industry in France is managed and whether this contributes to the spread. The method for raising birds for fois gras production, for example, is intensive and would involve handling the birds frequently, which may increase the likelihood of transmission with shared equipment or poultry handlers.

From a trade perspective, we would like to highlight that the new EU Implementing Decision allows a derogation for movement of hatching eggs and day old chicks from the large restriction zone only under written agreement between competent authorities on a case by case basis.

3. Conclusion
The publication of the ANSES risk assessment and the new restriction measures are welcome. The risk to the UK as a result of these outbreaks is primarily around pathways which involve lapses in biosecurity or trade routes rather than through wild birds, as these are apparently wholly European origin viruses. However, the situation in France simply reinforces what we already knew, that these LPAI viruses circulate in wild birds and cause occasional spill-over outbreaks in poultry and may be difficult to detect in domestic waterfowl species and which may then mutate into HPAI viruses following infection of galliforme hosts.

We will continue to monitor the situation closely. We would like to remind all poultry keepers to maintain high standards of biosecurity, remain vigilant, and report any suspect clinical signs promptly, and, in addition, to use the "testing to exclude scheme" for avian notifiable disease where appropriate for early safeguards.

The risk level for the UK remains at low, but heightened.
