Positive Isolation of West Nile Virus Confirmed in Crow from Stamford
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The State of Connecticut today identified a crow testing positive with West
Nile Virus collected from the Springdale section in the City of Stamford.
The crow was collected by the City of Stamford Health Department on Sunday,
23 Jul 2000, and was taken to the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment
Station (CAES) for testing. The crow expired before ground level spraying
was conducted on Tuesday, 25 Jul by the State of Connecticut with Scourge,
a Resmethrin product.
"This crow shows that virus activity did take place during the same time as
the positive mosquito isolate in July. Both identifications reaffirm that
West Nile Virus transmission is occurring in that area. The state believes
that actions taken last week to spray the targeted area have addressed the
immediate concerns," said Commissioner Arthur J. Rocque, Jr. "We will
continue to maintain an extensive and enhanced surveillance and testing
program in that area and beyond, to identify additional findings."
As reported on 21 Jul, the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station
isolated the presence of West Nile Virus from mosquitoes collected on 11
Jul 2000 at Sleepy Hollow Park in the Springdale section of Stamford. The
pool of mosquitoes that tested positive was _Culex restuans_, primarily a
bird-biting mosquito. As of 25 Jul 2000, 106 birds have tested negative for
West Nile Virus with 97 birds pending. All other mosquitoes and birds
tested in Connecticut thus far this summer have tested negative. The next
set of weekly state test results will be available on Tuesday, 1 Aug 2000.
"Connecticut remains well positioned to monitor and identify the presence
of West Nile Virus as it occurs in Connecticut," said Arthur J. Rocque,
Jr., Commissioner of the DEP. "The state urges citizens to continue to look
for ways around the home to reduce mosquitoes' primary breeding ground,
standing water and report dead bird sightings to their local health
departments."
The State is asking the public to continue reporting sightings of dead
birds throughout the summer and fall to their local health departments. The
Department of Public Health (DPH) coordinates the collection of information
on bird mortality, which includes reports of sightings of dead birds and
the testing of dead birds for WNV.
Mosquito testing for WNV and EEE virus is performed at CAES. The results of
mosquito testing will be available on a weekly basis and is faxed out to
local elected officials and health directors in the trap site towns and
neighboring state officials.
Connecticut's Mosquito EEE Contingency Plan, WNV Surveillance and Response
Plan, and a variety of fact sheets are available on DEP's web site:
<http://dep.state.ct.us> which can also be accessed through any of these
other websites: DPH's at <http://www.state.ct.us/dph> CAES's at
<http://www.state.ct.us/caes>.
The Mosquito Management Program is coordinated by the Department of
Environmental Protection (DEP) in collaboration with The Connecticut
Agricultural Experiment Station (CAES), the Department of Public Health
(DPH), Department of Agriculture (DoAg) and the University of Connecticut
(UConn).
Mosquito traps are placed in 73 locations throughout the state by The
Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station (CAES) and will be collected on
a ten-day rotation. DEP will maintain a 24-hour information line at (860)
424-4184 that is updated weekly with the latest mosquito and bird testing
results.
