Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza In Russia - Additional information
--------------------------------------------------------------------
[The following is a translation of additional information received by the OIE
on 5 Aug 2005 from Dr Evgueny A. Nepoklonov, Head of the Main Veterinary
Department, Ministry of Agriculture and Food, Moscow, concerning "The
structure of the haemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes of influenza virus
isolates from Novosibirsk region". This information supplements the OIE
Disease Information Update, 5 Aug 2005, Vol. 18 - No. 31
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/a_current.htm>, posted on ProMED-mail
as "Avian influenza - Russia (Siberia)(10): H5N1, OIE20050808.2315" - Mod.CP]
Electrophoregrams of amplification products using PCR primers recommended by
WHO indicated that the type A virus found in the samples of material is
related to subtype H5N1. For confirmation of the PCR results, amplified cDNA
fragments of 2 loci from the haemagglutinin gene and of a fragment of the
neuraminidase gene were sequenced. The results of the sequencing confirmed
that the type A virus found in the samples of material is related to subtype
H5N1.
In order to obtain additional information about the virulence of the isolates
(by determination of the structure of the haemagglutinin cleavage site), the
appropriate region of the genome was amplified and PCR fragments were
sequenced. This showed that the [inferred amino acid sequence] in this region
is PQGERRRKKR/GL, which is analogous to the sequence of the highly virulent
virus (HPAI) found in 3 species of migratory water birds during the epidemic
in May/June on Qinghai Lake (People's Republic of China) (ref. 1).
The nucleotide sequences of the PCR fragments of 2 other regions of the
haemagglutinin and neuraminidase sub-units showed highest similarity with the
nucleotide sequences of isolates from infected mountain geese and gulls at the
time of that epidemic.
[The report is illustrated by sequence data of the cleavage site for an
isolate from a turkey from the village of Suzdalka, Dovolnoye district,
Novosibirsk region (Information provided by Vector, the State Scientific
Centre for Virology and Biotechnology)]
According to the sequence data, the cleavage site structure is practically
identical to that of the highly pathogenic strain of subtype H5N1 isolated in
Hong Kong in 1997.
Phylogenetic analysis of the preliminary data on the neuraminidase structure
shows that it is practically identical to that of the isolate from bar-headed
geese (_Anser indicus_) from the Qinghai Lake region (People's Republic of
China).

[These sequence data reported to the OIE confirm unequivocally that the virus
recovered from wild aquatic birds in Siberia is a highly pathogenic avian
influenza A (H5N1) virus, closely related to the strain responsible for the
current disease outbreaks throughout East Asia. These data are compatible with
the theory that HPAI virus is being carried northwards by migrating waterfowl.
The Russian scientist reported that the inferred amino acid sequence at the
cleavage site is similar to that of the H5N1 virus isolated in Hong Kong in
1997. If this sequence differs significantly from that of the current East
Asian viruses, it might indicate that the virus reached Siberia by a different
route. This will be clarified as sequence data for this and other regions of
the genome accumulate. - Mod.CP]
