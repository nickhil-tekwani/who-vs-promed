Tick borne diseases are a big challenge for livestock and human beings in this new scenario of emerging diseases. In livestock, there are huge occurrences of theilriosis, anaplasmosis, and babesiosis. Some time ago, we observed mixed infections of TBDS [tick borne diseases] (hemoprotozoans) in single animals.

Tick populations [are higher], and this summer [2013] was very hard on livestock in Peshawar district and adjacent areas and districts of KP [Khyber Pakhtunkhwa].

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Khalid Khan for providing this information about the current prevalence of the tick vectors of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province of Pakistan.

The following is some additional relevant data about the role of ticks in the spread of CCHF:

Adult ticks attach to cattle, sheep, goats, or human beings. Livestock show no overt signs of disease, and farmers and slaughterhouse workers have little idea they have been infected until they start expressing symptoms: dizziness, muscular pain, and stiffness, and of course the signature bleeding, whereas infection in birds mostly tends to be abortive (with the exception of ostriches in South Africa).

About 30 countries in Africa, Asia, and Europe have reported CCHF infections. The tick vector of CCHF ventures no further than 50 degrees north latitude, which cuts across Russia, Ukraine, central Europe, and France. The latter 2 regions are not considered to be at any immediate risk, since the _Hyalomma_ spp. tick vectors are present, but there is no serological evidence of CCHF.

The distribution of known cases of CCHF across the Middle East and Africa is patchy; ticks are present in the whole of this region, but in many countries, [they] seem harmless. In Africa, only South Africa, and from time to time Mauritania, face ongoing outbreaks; countries such as Tanzania and Uganda have not reported any recent outbreaks, and countries such as Angola and Algeria seem not to be at risk.

As with many vector-borne diseases, several ecological and anthropocentric factors are likely to affect the disease's occurrence: increases in bush-type habitats, for example, and increases in wild animal populations. Taken together, these factors may cause the tick to switch to human beings.

Changing patterns of agriculture and flood controls may also have played a part. In the Soviet Union, agriculture was collectivised and flood plains converted to farmland. The recent cases in Pakistan could be related to the floods of 2010 and the resultant concentration of people and livestock in certain areas. The Muslim festival of Eid al-Adha, at which sheep and goats are sacrificed, may also be a contributing factor.

Only 4 countries have reported more than 50 CCHF cases per year: Iran, Russia, Turkey, and Uzbekistan (although it could easily be the case that these countries simply have particularly efficient surveillance systems backed by proper diagnostics). A few other nations report 5-49 cases per year. Most of the time, CCHF outbreaks affect a small number of people. - Mod.CP
