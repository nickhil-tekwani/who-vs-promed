At least 42 people have died in western Kenya following an outbreak of
cholera, health officials said. "At least 701 cases of the disease have
been reported in the western province of Nyanza," SK Sharif, the senior
deputy director of the area's medical services, said on 2 Apr 2008.

The disease, which was initially reported in the districts of Rongo, Siaya,
and Suba in January 2008, had spread to other districts in the region
despite control measures. The most affected areas included the districts of
Bondo, Homa Bay, Kisumu, Migori, and Nyando. Cases had also been reported
in Kisii and in the Bunyala area of Busia.

Sharif said the outbreak had been caused by gaps in water and sanitation
hygiene in the region and frequent outbreaks of the disease in neighboring
Uganda. Other risk factors included the use of untreated water and
contaminated food.

The mass movement of people during the post-election crisis may also have
contributed to the outbreak of the disease as people found themselves in
areas with inadequate water and sanitation facilities.

Cholera cases were also reported in Northeastern Province in January 2008
and February 2008 in the districts of Mandera Central, Mandera East, and
Wajir, where there were at least 12 deaths and 448 cases. The outbreak
followed similar outbreaks in Ethiopia and Somalia and was exacerbated by
inadequate water and sanitation hygiene.

[2] Cholera - Angola

Widespread flooding in southern Angola has been blamed for a surge in
cholera, with 4500 cases of the waterborne disease reported in 2008 with
150 fatalities.

According to Angola's health ministry, there were 590 new cases in the week
running up to 31 Mar 2008, up from the 503 cases reported the previous week.

About half of the infections were in Angola's southern provinces of Cunene
and Huila, which have been hard hit by flooding. According to the UN Office
for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), over 81 400 people had
been affected by the floods, with more than 56 000 displaced.

"The flooding caught everyone by surprise," said Adam Berthoud, regional
public health advisor for the development agency Oxfam. "Oxfam has been
working with the Angolan Red Cross, UNICEF (United Nations Children's
Fund), and government stakeholders to ensure access to clean water,
sanitation and key hygiene items such as soap and buckets," Bertohoud told
IRIN.

According to the WHO (World Health Organisation), a 2 year long cholera
outbreak that began in February 2006 resulted in 70 000 reported cases and
nearly 3000 deaths.

The number of cholera cases reported in the Ohangwena Region has almost
doubled, rising to 858, with 16 cases confirmed since 23 Feb 2008, regional
health director Dr Naftali Hamata announced yesterday [31 Mar 2008].

In the Eenhana district, a cholera patient died at the end of last week
[24-30 Mar 2008], bringing the total number of cholera deaths in Ohangwena
to 4. On 27 Mar 2008, The Namibian reported that 455 cholera cases had been
reported, with only 2 deaths in the Engela Health District, which includes
Oshikango and Okatope. In the meantime, another cholera patient has died at
Engela and a 4th at the Eenhana district hospital.

Hamata said there were fears that the disease would spread to other
hospital districts in the region.

A total of 97 suspected acute watery diarrhea (AWD) cases with 8 deaths
were reported from Suftu area in Dolo Ado woreda of Liben zone in Somali
Region. The cases were reported between 14 Jan 2008 and 15 Mar 2008,
according to the team deployed to the woreda [a woreda (sometimes spelled
wereda) is an administrative ward or local government of Ethiopia,
equivalent to a district. Woredas are composed of a number of kebele or
neighborhood associations, which are the smallest unit of local government
in Ethiopia - Mod.LL]. AWD cases were also reported by Kenyan health
authorities in an area bordering Somali Region.

According to Kenyan health authorities, the laboratory investigations
identified _Vibrio cholerae_. A cross border meeting was conducted by
health and administrative authorities to exchange information and
collaborate on the prevention and control activities by both sides.

[5] Cholera, diarrhea - Viet Nam (north)
Date: Tue 1 Apr 2008

Acute diarrhea has spread from Hanoi, Ha Tay, and Hai Phong to 5 other
provinces. Notably, the Health Ministry reported finding _Vibrio cholerae_
bacterium on water surface in these provinces.

In Thanh Hoa City and 3 districts of Thanh Hoa Province, including Hoang
Hoa, Vinh Loc, and Hau Loc, nearly 50 acute diarrhea cases were recorded
last week [24-30 Mar 2008], including 6 positive for _Vibrio cholerae_.

The Ministry of Health also verified that acute diarrhea has appeared in
other northern provinces, Nam Dinh, Phu Tho, Bac Ninh, and Bac Giang. Most
of the patients ate raw vegetables, rare food or processed food.

The Preventive Health Agency said the disease may develop into a large
epidemic because cholera bacteria from human feces has spread to the
environment and polluted surface water of ponds, lakes and sewers and can
pollute food as well.

[6] Cholera, diarrhea - Viet Nam (north)

The 2 northern provinces of Ha Nam and Vinh Phuc have been added to the
list of provinces hit by acute diarrhea, raising the total number to 10. On
2 Apr 2008, the Health Ministry admitted that the diarrhea epidemic has
broken out again, with nearly 100 patients who are positive for the _Vibrio
cholerae_ bacterium.

Dr Nguyen Huy Nga, head of the Preventive Health and Environment Agency,
stated that acute diarrhea has spread to 10 provinces. In the 2 latest
provinces with the disease, there is one cholera patient each. The total
number of cholera patients is 85 at present, including 44 in Hanoi.

The number of acute diarrhea patients at hospitals in Hanoi is increasing
very fast. On 2 Apr 2008 the National Infectious and Tropical Disease
Hospital received nearly 70 patients. Diarrhea patients now have to lie on
the hospital corridors. Up to 5 patients have developed serious kidney failure.

The Hospital's Director Nguyen Duc Hien said of the total number of
diarrhea patients treated at the hospital since early March 2008, there are
61 who have been confirmed to have cholera, who mainly come form Hanoi and
Ha Tay.

The Ministry of Health worries that the epidemic will bloom because this is
the wedding season and the summer is approaching. At a 600 member party in
the central province of Thanh Hoa, food was prepared within 2-3 days and 40
people got diarrhea, including 6 confirmed to have cholera. The 1st cholera
patient in Vinh Phuc province also caught the disease at a wedding party.

According to surveys by the Central Hygiene and Epidemiology Institute, in
the provinces with cholera, locals often put down excrement on vegetables
and this is a source of the bacterium.
