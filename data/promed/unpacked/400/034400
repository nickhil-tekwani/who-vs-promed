Cholera outbreak in Melchor
by Melvin Flores
MELCHOR DE MENCHOS, Tues. June 9
Dr. Luis Alberto Maroquin Veliz, head of the Melchor Hospital, told
AMANDALA this afternoon that a cholera outbreak in Melchor is suspected of
having caused the death of one person, and that there are 5 confirmed cases
of cholera in the hospital.
The outbreak was initially diagnosed on May 4, 1998, said Dr. Veliz, and
since then, the hospital had been treating an average of 2-3 patients
daily, which had increased to 11, then fluctuated between 2-5 cases daily.
Sixty persons with symptoms of cholera have already been treated in the
hospital, and 360 persons have already been treated at the out-clinics.
San Ignacio's Public Health Department has reported two confirmed cases of
cholera, one in Benque Viejo del Carmen, and the other in Las Flores.
Fifteen family members have been treated for the disease. The district has
launched plans to counter any outbreak of cholera, setting up testing units
in Benque Viejo, San Ignacio and Belmopan. A mobile unit has also been
equipped to deal with outbreaks in the outlying villages.
The last outbreak of cholera in Belize was in July-August, 1995, when four
persons died.
The Mopan, Macal and the Belize Old Rivers have been tested for the
disease, and authorities are awaiting the results of the tests.
Meanwhile, medical authorities in Melchor are testing the streams which
feed the Mopan, and they have suspended the activities of street vendors in
Melchor until the vendors can prove that they have complied with certain
guidelines laid down for the preparation of food.
In Melchor, the cholera bacterium has so far been found in cabbages used by
both vendors and citizens of that municipality.
Belize health authorities on Sunday, June 7, administered aid to a resident
living in the Guatemalan side of Arenal, a village that straddles the
Belize/Guatemalan border.
