[1] FAO weekly report, 15-22 Mar 2019
Date: Fri 22 Mar 2019

http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/empres/ASF/Situation_update.html
[The new update is expected to become available soon at the source URL. - Mod.AS]


1. Situation update [for the week 15-22 Mar 2019]
------------------
China:
Since the China Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MARA) confirmed its 1st African swine fever (ASF) outbreak in Liaoning Province on 3 Aug 2018, a total of 114 ASF outbreaks have been detected in 28 provinces/autonomous region/municipalities. More than 950 000 pigs have been culled in an effort to halt further spread.
[During the week 15-22 Mar 2019, a new ASF outbreak was reported from] Chongqing Municipality: one farm with 91 pigs in Shizhu County.

Viet Nam:
Since the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) confirmed its ASF outbreaks on 19 Feb 2019, a total of 366 outbreaks were reported in 20 provinces/cities, and more than 46 600 pigs have been culled. Viet Nam has implemented movement control of pigs and pig products from affected communes; ASF-positive farms have been depopulated according to the emergency response action plan against ASF. MARD has proposed further control plans.

Between 15 and 22 Mar 2019, ASF outbreaks were reported in Thai Binh (51), Hai Phong (25), Hung Yen (23), Bac Ninh (23), Thanh Hoa (11), Hai Duong (9), Ha Noi (9), Son La (9), Quang Ninh (6), Dien Bien (3), Nghe An (1), Thua Thien-Hue (1), and Lai Chau (1).

2. [New] actions taken by China [during the week 15-22 Mar 2019]
-----------------------------------
MARA released notice no. 7 on "Strengthening ASF detection during slaughter". Recognizing that the detection of ASF in the slaughtering process is an effective means to cut off the route of virus transmission, task pig slaughter enterprises to conduct self-inspection by using PCR. According to the size of the company and scope, deadlines were set:

- Cross-provincial sales of pig products, slaughtering enterprises of [more than] 100 000/year, and integrated pig slaughtering and processing enterprises -- from 1 Apr [2019];
- Slaughtering enterprises of [more than] 50 000/year -- 1 May [2019];
- Other slaughter companies -- 1 Jul [2019].

Local veterinary authorities are to guide the slaughter enterprises in building laboratories that meet the technical requirements for PCR testing, to supply reagents, and to train technicians. Strengthening capacity of the county-level animal disease prevention and control institutions to support small slaughter enterprises for testing [the testing regime prescribed in the said enterprises is the following]:

- As pre-admission test, collect blood samples from all vehicles consigning pigs before entering slaughterhouse, and test as pooled samples. During slaughter, if a typical lesion suspecting ASF is found, the slaughter should be suspended immediately; transfer ASF-suspected pigs to an isolation room and collect samples for testing. For the pig blood for feed ingredients, 3 samples per vehicle must be tested before leaving the facility.
- When a pig slaughtering enterprise detects ASF nucleic acid, it should stop production immediately. After 48 hours, the enterprise can apply to the local animal husbandry and veterinary department for evaluation. If qualified, the production can be resumed. The culled pigs (including the same batch of pigs that have been slaughtered) will be subsidized in accordance with the notice issued by the Ministry of Finance and MARA.
- In case of reasons such as the test not being done accordingly, fraud, etc., ASF virus nucleic acid-positive pig products are sent out from a slaughterhouse, the pig products shall be destroyed on the spot, the slaughter enterprises shall be ordered to recall products of the same batch, and destroy. The slaughtering activities shall be suspended, conduct thorough cleaning and disinfection, and after 15 days, after evaluation, production can be resumed. No subsidies will be given for the culled pigs and the destroyed pig products.

Before 1 May [2019], a comprehensive inspection of pig slaughtering enterprises shall be conducted at the provincial level. Enterprises without pollutant discharge permit or [which do] not meet the animal epidemic prevention requirements, shall immediately stop production and rectify. If the rectification fails to meet the standards before 1 Jul [2019], cancel the qualification as fixed-point slaughter. It is necessary to encourage slaughter enterprises to establish scales through mergers and reorganizations, to enhance the scale, procedures, and qualifications.

[The above FAO update also includes the following tables:

Table 1. List of affected cities in China since 3 Aug 2018 (for each province, the name of the last city affected and the date of the last reported onset are given).

Table 2. List of affected provinces in Viet Nam since 19 Feb 2019 (for each province, the number of communes affected and the date of the last reported onset are given).

The new sanitary measures in China's huge slaughtering system, in particular the ambitious efforts to detect infection by PCR in all consignments prior to their entrance into the facilities, need some additional detail. What steps are to be taken to trace back source(s) of infection? How/where is culling to be performed when prescribed? How/where are the vehicles and contacts to be disinfected? Last but not least: How is extra-system slaughter to be prevented/controlled (e.g., home slaughtering, semi-commercial slaughter in rural areas)? Is the rate of such practices in China, or its estimates, available? - Mod.AS]

[2] Media on ASF actual dimensions and impact in China
Date: Mon 18 Mar 2019

https://www.pigprogress.net/Health/Articles/2019/3/ASF-China-Pig-herd-falls-166-in-February-405332E/


China's pig herd has decreased by 16.6% in February year-on-year, according to official figures. This is likely to be the 1st concrete Chinese data indicating the effect of African swine fever (ASF) on the country's pig herd.

The data were shared by the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MARA), press agency Reuters reported. The number of sows even dropped 19.1% in February [2019] from the same month a year earlier, according to the data, which were collected from 400 counties across the nation. The pig herd shrunk 5.4% and the sow herd 5% compared with January [2019].

More proof emerged over the weekend that ASF is going to have a serious impact on swine production in China. News agency Bloomberg reported that China has made the biggest purchase of pork in nearly 2 years. In the week ending 7 Mar 2019, the country bought 23 800 metric tonnes. According to the news agency, that was the largest sale since April 2017. Bloomberg added that China has also started to buy pork domestically to increase its own reserves.

Thoughts of a similar nature were shared by Dr. Mark Lyons, Alltech CEO, who spoke last week at an audience in Dublin, Ireland. He said, "Several CEOs of large agricultural conglomerates told me at VIV Asia that they think that ASF has broken out at 30% to 50% percent of the Chinese pig farms. That would then mean 1 of 5 pigs in the world. China will therefore start purchasing pork massively -- that has already been starting in the last few weeks."

Dr. Lyons continued to say that he is expecting a change in the perception of pork among consumers. He said, "It could go in 2 directions. China does not apply any transparency with regard to what is going on. Even in Western markets this could lead to a mistrust as to pork safety."

He continued to say, "On the other hand, however, as a result of strongly increasing prices and empty shelves, that could lead to appreciation for intensive agriculture, as this sector takes care of food safety, animal welfare and transparency about the initiatives to deal with environmental problems related to that production. It is not clear yet, but this ASF has all it takes to become a game changer for agriculture."

[3] ASF spread in Viet Nam
Date: Thu 21 Mar 2019

African swine fever (ASF) is continuing its spread through Viet Nam with rapid pace. Yesterday [20 Mar 2019] the news broke that an outbreak was confirmed in a village in mid-Viet Nam, at 350 km [about 217 mi] south of the nearest outbreak location at that moment.

The new outbreak was found in the village called Phong Son, in Thua Thien-Hue province, at about 100 km [62 mi] from the well-known city Da Nang. The outbreak had started on 13 Mar 2019, according to a report submitted to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). In total, 5 animals were infected according to the report.

There are serious signs that ASF has already spread further south, as warned by the Cambodian authorities that the virus would spread to Viet Nam provinces adjacent to Cambodia, although nothing has been reported to the OIE so far. The newspaper The Phnom Penh Post reported that an official of the Cambodian Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said late last week that the virus would have entered zones neighbouring Cambodia's Ratanakkiri and Kratie provinces [see 20190320.6377843].

Provinces bordering Ratanakkiri and Kratie are the Vietnamese provinces of Dak Lak, Dak Nong and Binh Phuoc. Officially none of these provinces are reported infected at the OIE. In our interactive maps they have nevertheless received a pink colour, without having blue outbreak dots [see at https://tinyurl.com/yyfu29ox].

Tan Phannara, the general directorate of animal health and production director-general, said that he had received informal information regarding that from animal feed companies and animal raising associations. He called on officials in these provinces to remain alert, saying: "I have received information that [Vietnamese] provinces that border Ratanakkiri and Kratie are reporting cases of ASF, and so I urge all officials to be vigilant," he said.

Officially, Viet Nam has reported 20 provinces with ASF, with 208 reports. When these figures are all added up, more than 11 000 animals have been directly or indirectly affected by the virus.

In the meantime, the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has called on Viet Nam to declare ASF a national emergency, news agency Reuters reported. The FAO at this stage already spoke of 239 outbreaks being confirmed and culling of more than 25 000 animals.

The article quotes Albert T. Lieberg, FAO representative in Viet Nam, saying: "The loss of pigs due to ASF infection and control measures leads to a heavy economic burden for many rural families."

Viet Nam has been implementing strict movement control of pigs and pig products, but the FAO said small farms with low biosecurity will allow ASF's spread.

[Viet Nam has submitted its follow-up reports no. 9 and 10 on 19 and 20 Mar 2019, respectively. Links to all reports and a summarising interactive map are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=29617.

As of 20 Mar 2019, the event in Viet Nam, which reportedly started 1 Feb 2019, was summarised by the OIE as follows:

Total outbreaks = 208 (submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Swine / 11 501 / 1324 / 465 / 11 036 / 0

No cases in wild boar have been reported from Viet Nam.

The wide distribution of the ASF virus in China is also reflected by the detection of the virus in food parcels/consignments found or confiscated in airports beyond China's mainland, particularly in Taiwan. The most recent report was published on Thu 21 Mar 2019 (http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201903210019.aspx), related to fish balls containing pork that were tested for ASF on 13 Mar 2019, after being found discarded at Kaohsiung International Airport. The product is believed to have been brought into Taiwan by a passenger who disembarked from a Uni Air flight from Fuzhou. This case brings the total number of pork products, confirmed as infected with ASF upon arrival in Taiwan to 34 since October 2018 (one in October, 2 in November, and 4 in December 2018, 11 in January, 11 in February, and 5 in March 2019, according to statistics compiled by Taiwan's Central Emergency Operation Center for ASF. - Mod.AS
