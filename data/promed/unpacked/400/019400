A 72-year-old male patient in Los Santos province was positive in laboratory tests that confirmed that he had hantavirus pulmonary syndrome [HPS].

The Regional Health Director for Los Santos, Roy Herrera, stated that this patient, from the Flories community in Tonosi, was admitted 2 days ago [23 Jun 2014] in the Las Tablas Joaquin Pablo Franco Sayas Hospital with symptoms of this disease. This older adult was transferred from the Tonosi rural hospital, where he was initially treated, the physician added.

Herrera regretted that the Tonosi populace still was not concerned about hantavirus [infection].

[Hantaviruses are endemic in Panama. The 30 May 2014 ProMED-mail post (archive no. 20140602.2515039) indicated that as of that date, there had been 22 cases of hantavirus infection in Los Santos province. Presumably, the new case, above, was still alive at the time the health authorities issued their report.

Los Santos province is endemic for Choclo hantavirus, which has caused several HPS cases as mentioned above. Although the hantavirus involved in this case is not specified, the one most likely responsible is Choclo virus. As mentioned in ProMED-mail archive number 20130204.1527935, of the 3 hantaviruses known to occur in Panama, only Choclo is a known human pathogen, causing HPS, which can have a high case fatality rate, especially when victims come to hospital late in the course of their disease. No ecological details are provided concerning the environment where the man may have acquired his infection.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg.
