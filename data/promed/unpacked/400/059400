An unvaccinated individual, who caught the contagious disease in Poland, attended a large church service in Tampere and infected at least 2 other people. Three adults have been diagnosed with measles in Tampere after attending a Catholic parish church event in late November along with more than 100 people, according to the Pirkanmaa Hospital District.

Two of the adults diagnosed have been vaccinated, so they are not contagious. The source of the outbreak is an unvaccinated person, who caught the measles in Poland. But according to the Pirkanmaa Hospital District, further cases may still arise.

In 1975 Finland began to administer a single dose of the measles vaccine to all one-year-olds and by 1982 Finland began administering the vaccine in 2 doses between the ages of 1 and 6. However some people born in the 1970s are among those who received only one jab. MMR is a triple-dose vaccine that provides protection against measles, mumps and rubella.

Measles spread at religious event
---------------------------------
The event in question was Tampere's Pyhan Ristin (Sacred Cross) Catholic Parish church mass on 25 Nov 2018. It was attended by more than 100 people, including children. Pirkanmaa Hospital District doctor Kirsi Valve, a specialist in infectious diseases, confirmed that the infected individual who caught the measles in Poland was at the church event. The cases came to light when 2 vaccinated individuals contracted high fevers and came down with skin rashes. The unvaccinated person, who infected the others, has had more severe symptoms than the vaccinated individuals.

"The individuals quickly got in touch with healthcare services owing to high fevers, and skin rashes that rapidly spread all over their bodies," says Valve. "It was confirmed that on 25 Nov 2018 the unvaccinated individual who caught the measles in Poland and brought it back to Finland was at the parish event and is the source of the outbreak."

As the source of the outbreak is known, healthcare officials are also looking into whether the person could have possibly exposed others.

Measles in the news
-------------------
Measles has been on the agenda this winter after an unvaccinated child in Ostrobothnia took ill with measles. Meanwhile, it also came to light that many adults in Finland may not have been vaccinated against measles during the early 1970s.

Measles is a rare disease. The previous outbreak was 2 summers ago when 4 vaccinated children caught measles in Italy and started showing symptoms after returning to Finland. The Pirkanmaa Hospital District recommends that anyone who attended the Catholic parish event in late November 2018 and exhibits symptoms that suggest measles or anyone who hasn't been vaccinated with the MMR vaccine contact their healthcare centre.

If those who attended the parish event are healthy, but have not been vaccinated, the Pirkanmaa Hospital District recommends that they contact their healthcare centre to be vaccinated. The measles vaccine is free and administered as part of the MMR shot, which also provides protection against rubella and the mumps.

While last year [2017], 142 cases of measles were detected in the Czech Republic, 182 cases had been detected as of 4 Dec 2018, according to the State Health Institute. Doctors warn that although it is mandatory to vaccinate children against measles, many are not [vaccinated]. The disease is preventable through 2 doses of a safe and effective vaccine.

The highly contagious, airborne disease experienced an unprecedented resurgence in 2017 in the Americas, Eastern Mediterranean and Europe, according to the World Health Organization. It can cause debilitating or fatal complications, including encephalitis (an infection that leads to swelling of the brain), severe diarrhoea and dehydration, pneumonia, ear infections and permanent vision loss.

https://brooklyneagle.com/articles/2018/12/13/measles-outbreak-in-brooklyns-orthodox-jewish-areas-continues-to-climb/


The number of confirmed cases of measles in Brooklyn's Orthodox Jewish community increased to 42 this week, up from 6 cases in October 2018, according to the NYC Department of Health (DoH). The city has begun barring kids who haven't had the required measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine from attending school, which includes Jewish religious yeshivas.

The 1st Brooklyn child with measles acquired the infection on a visit to Israel, where a large outbreak is occurring, according to DoH. The highly-contagious disease has since spread among children (and a couple of adults) in Borough Park and Williamsburg.

Dr Joseph Kaplovitz, pediatric specialist at NYU Langone Stepping Stones clinic in Borough Park, told the Brooklyn Eagle that he expects to see more measles cases. "I do suspect it to go on for another month or 2," he said. "The problem is, it's very contagious. There's a 90 per cent chance you'll catch it if you're in a room with someone who has it and you're not immunized." It can be contagious even before the rash shows up, he added, so if the office suspects a child has the disease, they will be met outside the office, outside in the fresh air, so they don't bring the infection inside.

Two of his patients have been confirmed as having the disease, and he suspects he saw 2 more cases this week. While most of his Orthodox patients -- roughly 95 per cent, he estimated -- have been immunized, there's "lots of misinformation" still being spread by anti-vaxxers. "They may believe conspiracy theories, like [the vaccine] causes autism, even though that idea has been shot down. Mercury and preservatives are another reason, even though there's more mercury in a can of tuna fish," he said. "While they have some valid concerns, when we do a risk-benefit analysis, we see that the side effects of the vaccine are exceedingly small compared to the bad the measles can do."

Since the city started requiring the measles shots, "We've had patients come in, and that's the only vaccine the child has. But now they can go to school." Kaplovitz said the closeness of the Orthodox Jewish community contributed to the disease's spread. "We're amongst each other," he said. "We spend a lot of time together. In a way, that's better; we don't spread it to anyone else." He said it was appropriate for the city to ban non-immunized children from schools. "It's prudent to have kids stay home if they don't have their 2 MMR shots."

To fight misconceptions, the city has reached out to the Orthodox community, and Kaplovitz' office hands out a 30-page pamphlet prepared by a rabbinical organization that explains the benefits of vaccination, how vaccines are made and tested, and other details. Vaccination is required for all children 2 months to 18 years old who go to child care, public school or private school.

The disease, which causes fever and a rash from head to toe, has been nearly eradicated in the United States but still exists in other countries. The initial Brooklyn case was acquired by a child on a visit to Israel, where a large outbreak was taking place. Besides Borough Park and Williamsburg, the infection has been spreading in Hasidic villages in upstate New York -- New Square and Muncie -- and in the Orthodox community in Lakewood, New Jersey, Kaplovitz said. Other cases have broken out at a related Orthodox community in Rockland County.

While not as deadly as now-eradicated smallpox, which looks similar to measles in its early stage, many do not realize how serious measles can be. In the pre-vaccine era, roughly 6000 measles deaths were reported in the US each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Young children, the immunocompromised and non-immune pregnant women are at highest risk for severe complications, including pneumonia, brain damage, deafness or even death.

The vaccine was introduced in 1963, and measles was declared eliminated from the United States in 2000. But as vaccination rates have dropped, the disease has experienced a comeback, particularly in Orthodox and other ultra-religious communities, such as the Amish. The number of parents against mandatory vaccines has also increased, especially in the western states. The LA Times estimates that 10 per cent of children in private and religious schools in California go without protection from childhood diseases. The decline in vaccination rates across communities has led to the resurgence of diseases like measles and mumps, and recent outbreaks "have demonstrated the importance of an integrated infection prevention response," according to research presented in June 2018 at the 45th Annual Conference of the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC).

The Florida Department of Health says 4 children infected with measles were home-schooled and are being "self-isolated" to prevent the spread of the highly contagious virus. G Steve Huard, spokesman for the Department of Health (DoH) in Sarasota, says a contact investigation was nearly complete when a news release warning the public was issued on Tue [12 Dec 2018]. "It was a prudent, best possible option to go out to the public and let everybody know we had some cases in the community," Huard said. "We don't believe we will see any more cases."

In the statement, the DoH said it was working with community health care partners to identify and notify people who may have been exposed. The source of the recent outbreak has not been identified. Unvaccinated individuals may be excluded from public places for up to 21 days, such as school and work.

Florida requires vaccinations to be administered to children before they enrol and attend child care and school, with exceptions made for religious and medical reasons only. However, students home-schooled under state statute -- the "home education program" -- who do not attend a public or private institution are not required to get immunizations.

Huard said the 4 children with "close contact with each other" were not in public school. He could not disclose what part of the county they live in. "The real issue is that we need everyone to know what happened," he said. "This is really a good opportunity to go get a vaccination if you're not already vaccinated, even one dose of the measles-mumps-rubella will give a level of protection more than people already have."

Residents and visitors who have not been immunized are urged to get vaccinated. Huard says investigators examined the area where measles cases were reported to determine the risk assessment. No other patients have been located. Most measles cases, according to Huard, are brought in from overseas from countries with different vaccination standards.

This year [2018] in the United States, 220 measles cases had been reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) by 3 Nov 2018; 120 cases were reported in 2017. Among Florida kindergartners, 93.7 per cent are vaccinated, says CDC.

"We believe the risk would be very low to the general public," Huard said. "However, out of an abundance of caution, it's important that people understand that measles is a highly contagious disease. Our main message here is that now is a good time [to get vaccinated]."

[6] Sierra Leone

https://www.journalducameroun.com/en/sierra-leone-declares-measles-epidemic/


The Sierra Leone government says it has mounted a search for active cases of measles nationwide as it declared an outbreak of the disease in 2 of its 16 districts. The Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MoHS) said on Thu [13 Dec 2018] that a total of 7 cases have been confirmed out of about 2 dozen suspected cases reported in Kambia District in the north and Pujehun District in the south. Both districts are home to the 2 largest land entry border points between Sierra Leone and its 2 neighbors, Guinea and Liberia.

Officials say preliminary investigations revealed that the index case of the outbreak in Kambia, which accounts for 4 of the confirmed cases, came from neighboring Guinea, which has been battling a large measles epidemic since 2017. The cases in Pujehun are believed to have come from Liberia, which is also said to be dealing with a large measles epidemic.

MoHS officials said the 1st suspected cases were reported on 6 Dec 2018, after which efforts were made to transport and test the samples. The 7 cases were confirmed positive on Wed [12 Dec 2018], said Dr Thomas T Samba, the head of the Public Health Emergency Operations Center (PHEOC) and acting chief medical officer at the Ministry of Health. Dr Samba told journalists at an emergency press conference that a team from the rapid response unit of the Ministry of Health had been dispatched to the affected areas. "We are doing everything in our power and capacity to bring this outbreak under control," he said. But while the MoHS says it needs 350 000 doses of the vaccine to contain the current outbreak, it currently has in stock only about 165 000 doses.

Over 80 per cent of vaccines targeting child diseases in Sierra Leone are provided by donors. Vaccination, which is free, is said to be the only reliable way to ensure children are protected against this life-threatening illness, which can be devastating in its effects.

This is the 2nd time Sierra Leone is declaring a measles outbreak this year [2018] alone. In June 2018, the 1st outbreak was recorded in the northern Falaba district, which also shares a border with Guinea. About 25 cases were recorded back then at the start of that epidemic.

Uganda has strengthened surveillance across the country after 40 districts were reportedly hit by a measles outbreak, a top health official said on Tue [18 Dec 2018]. Sarah Opendi, minister of state for health, told Parliament that the ministry has provided vaccines and other antigens for routine immunization. Opendi said that since October 2018, 2 deaths from measles have been registered and 141 other cases managed. According to the ministry, the affected districts are in the north western, western and central regions.

Measles, according to the Ministry of Health, is one of the killer diseases among children below 5 years. The others include tetanus, whooping cough, diphtheria, polio and tuberculosis.

With 44 districts, 20 regions and 10 294 affected people, the measles epidemic has reached its peak. The districts of Antananarivo Renivohitra and Ambato Boeny are the most affected. As the stock of vaccine is exhausted except vaccines for infants up to 9 months old already scheduled to be vaccinated in health facilities according to the vaccination schedule, the importation of new vaccine doses is under way.

A milestone of 10 000 cases in all age groups has now been crossed. The measles epidemic affecting children, adolescents and adults hit a large part of the Antananarivo district, with 5971 cases, and that of Ambato Boeny, where 782 cases were recorded. In total, 44 districts in Madagascar are affected by this epidemic, which started about 3 months ago. With 20 affected regions out of 22, the epidemic has spread across the island; the exceptions are the 2 regions of Ihorombe and Anosy.

The resurgence of measles cases is explained by gaps in vaccination. Indeed, the number of children vaccinated at 9 months (the age indicated for vaccination against measles in Madagascar) has been steadily decreasing.

As the number of vulnerable or unvaccinated people is high, so too is the risk of people developing the disease. Since the beginning of the current epidemic, nearly 70% of measles cases are children and adolescents aged 1-14 years, with a clear predominance of unvaccinated people in the age group of less than one year.

Similarly, 55% of all cases are unvaccinated or of unknown vaccination status. "It's only in the face of this growing epidemic that people are realizing the importance of immunization. And yet routine vaccination has for years included that against measles from 9 months. Similarly, Mother and Child Health Week (MSM) is an opportunity to carry out catch-up vaccination," says Dr Manitra Rakotoarivony. Completely free vaccines in public health facilities are accessible to every child from 9-11 months.

Currently, in the face of the epidemic situation, measles vaccines are out of stock for older subjects. According to the Ministry of Public Health, the doses still available are intended only for children who will soon reach the age of 9 months and who are scheduled, according to the appointments already set during their last immunization session, to be soon vaccinated against measles. The health authorities had to use the safety stock to meet the growing needs of the growing epidemic in Antananarivo. However, an import of new batches of vaccines is under way.

Measles is not the only epidemic currently affecting Antananarivo. The current epidemiological situation indicates that the district of Antananarivo Renivohitra is also in a rubella epidemic, as well as 2 other districts, namely Ambanja and Amboasary South, with at least 5 cases per district confirmed in one month. The case fatality rate is, however, 0%.
