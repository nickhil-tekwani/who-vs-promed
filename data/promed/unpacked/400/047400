Robert S. Gainer, 2018. Spore concentration and modified host resistance as cause of anthrax outbreaks: A practitioner's perspective. Canadian Veterinary Journal 59 (2):185-187.

[Abstracted, summarized - Mod.MHJ]:
Most of what is written about the cause of anthrax outbreaks is by professional academics in the fields of microbiology, epidemiology, and pathology. Little has been written by veterinary practitioners as it is normally not part of their job. Academic contributions could be closer to the actual fact and could be more useful if they recognized a practitioner's humble experiential intuition.

Gainer is a large animal veterinarian in practice for over 30 years in northern Alberta and southern Northwest Territories. He notes that without the usual alkaline soil-storing spores acting as a source of infection, the infection must be transmitted from host to host with the infection able to exist in a latent state most of the time. Anthrax develops as a peracute infection when the extremely oppressive insect harassment during high summer reduces the populations' resistance to low levels, and tabanid biting flies transmit the bacteria.

In a 3-year study in the Selous National Park in Tanzania, anthrax was suspected in the wildebeest by previous biologists and veterinarians, but was not confirmed despite many submissions for culture and histopathology. A Canadian pathologist, Bob Lewis, suggested he take lab mice into the field and inject them with carcass fluids as soon as possible. The mice that died were to be frozen for transport and shipped to the closest diagnostic lab. Eight of 9 mice came back positive for anthrax, and he stopped doing necropsies on carcasses that may have been anthrax-infected. Of the 28 confirmed and suspect field necropsies, none showed the macroscopic features considered to be diagnostic of the disease at that time. Eventually, he noticed that the retropharyngeal lymph nodes were enlarged in some, but not in all. Mostly they differed little from the normal healthy animals we shot and necropsied routinely for food and other purposes. At the same time, 4/8 biologists with the project developed cutaneous anthrax lesions on their hands. In his 30 years as a veterinarian in Alberta and NW Territories, he has noted a similar pattern of apparently healthy animals dead. In these Canadian regions, the summer heat and fly stress was so stark, his hands would get covered in blood from his horses.

[We know that animals can acquire latent infections with _B. anthracis_. It is well documented and would allow the pathogen to pass successfully from one summer to the next when the latter summer heat would reduce the innate resistance, the infection could break loose, bring the animal down, and be a source of infection for a number of other stock. A coincident plague of biting flies would exacerbate the stress.

Logically, this latent infection may explain how the pathogen was brought by sea in the 16th century from Andalusia in cattle destined for the Spanish missions in New Spain. Not having barbed wire in the 16th century, the common grazing Plains bison would have become infected, and, in their seasonal migrations, transferred it north and eventually into the Wood bison herds in northern Alberta and North West Territories, where it became and is still especially virulent. A working Wood bison bull weighs 1135 Kg. while the mature Plains bison bull is only some 910 Kg., and in any Wood bison outbreak, over 80% of the deaths are of bulls. The extra virulence is needed to kill them. After the widespread and almost total slaughter of bison in the 19th century, anthrax had to be reintroduced into the western plains with the trailed cattle from Texas.

I, and many others, have tried and failed to recover viable anthrax spores in the soil under and next to carcasses of confirmed white tail deer deaths from anthrax. They are very sensitive to the anthrax toxins and die with low titres. Where the spores persist on affected Texas ranches has yet to be determined. Once a deer is dead, the potential for blow fly contamination of nearby browse -- the deer's favorite food, though they do also graze -- is available, and other deer will be infected, if not also by biting flies. Maybe Bob's hypothesis of cycles of latent infection may explain the persistence of this disease in Texas white tails.

Bob has suggested an associated atypical-death reducing cause recognition and a latent infection cycle exacerbated by seasonal stress. These are hypotheses, and nature is illiterate and does what it does. But, anyone needing a project for their graduate students might want to explore these ideas. Retropharyngeal and mesenteric lymph nodes could be collected from deer at dressing stations for evidence of latent infections, and blood samples to check for antibody status and proof of exposure. Logically, this should be done on ranches where deer deaths from anthrax or not are known. Similarly, are atypical deaths of uncertain cause more common in cattle herds that have suffered from anthrax?

I have known Bob for a number of years. He is sound. There are a number of his anthrax articles listed in the CVJ article. If you should want to discuss this paper with Bob Gainer, his email is: <gainer.bob@gmail.com>.

As an academic, albeit an epidemiologist and not a clinician, I would like to comment that Bob may be describing hyperacute-stress deaths in livestock and wildlife with latent _Bacillus anthracis_ infections and not from latent _B. anthracis_ infections. Remember, more men die with enlarged prostate glands than from prostate cancer. - Mod.MHJ]
