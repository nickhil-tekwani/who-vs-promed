Officials are investigating after detecting influenza in 11 pigs recently exhibited at a fair in Frederick [Frederick county].

The Maryland Department of Agriculture said in a statement [Sun 24 Sep 2017] preliminary tests show the 11 pigs from The Great Frederick Fair are infected with influenza A. It isn't clear if that strain is potentially transmissible to humans, and additional testing is being conducted.

The statement says all swine at the fairgrounds are under a quarantine. The discovery comes after pigs at a fair in Charles County were recently diagnosed with swine flu.

After that diagnosis, Maryland's Secretary of Agriculture issued an order canceling all pig activities at the St Mary's and Calvert county fairs. That order remains in effect, but the department says all other activities involving swine can proceed as usual.

[The current post may be related to a recent outbreak of swine influenza in pigs at the Charles County, Maryland fair, which ProMED-mail recently posted (Influenza (24): USA (MD) swine origin, H3N2v 20170923.5335679); this outbreak at the Charles County Fair was associated with swine influenza in 7 Maryland residents who had close contact with the infected pigs.

Swine influenza (swine flu) is a respiratory disease of pigs caused by type A influenza virus that regularly causes outbreaks of influenza in pigs. Swine flu viruses do not usually infect humans, but rare human infections have occurred.

H1N1 and H3N2 swine flu viruses are endemic among pig populations in the United States and something that the industry deals with routinely. Outbreaks among pigs normally occur in colder weather months (late fall and winter), but can occur year round (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/keyfacts_pigs.htm).

However, it is a bit confusing that the pig activities at 2 fairs are canceled but other activities involving swine can proceed. I am supposing the canceled activities are at the 2 named fairs of St Mary's and Calvert county fairs, but swine activities at other fairs may continue. - Mod.TG]
