Low Pathogenic Bird Flu Breaks Out in Taiwan
--------------------------------------------
The Taiwanese veterinary authorities have reported an outbreak of low
pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI), at Zhupei City located in Northern
Taiwan's Hsinchu.

The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) received an immediate
notification yesterday, 17 Nov 2011. The causal agent was found to be
H5N2 serotype.

The affected population consists of 2720 native chicken breeders and
3280 native chickens, thereby bringing the number of susceptible birds
to 6000. Out of this, 20 cases were identified. No deaths were
recorded, and no birds were destroyed.

The report states that the notifiable avian influenza (NAI) viral
infection was detected on a native chicken breeder farm in the process
of active surveillance and identified as H5N2 strain on 15 Nov 2011.
Movement restriction was implemented on the infected farm immediately
when the virus was detected.

Clinical health investigation in the infected farm was done and showed
that the breeders were in healthy condition and without clinical
signs. The positive results of serological and virological tests
confirm this H5N2 outbreak. The clinical and epidemiological
investigation of surrounding poultry farms and pathogenicity test of
virus isolate are in progress.

According to the report, note by the OIE Animal Health Information
Department: H5 and H7 avian influenza in its low pathogenic form in
poultry is a notifiable disease as per Chapter 10.4. on avian
influenza of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code (2011).

The source of the outbreak remains inconclusive.
