Gert van Dijk - Chairman of the Q fever Evaluation Committee
------------------------------------------------------------
Prof. Dr Ing Gert van Dijk will chair the committee which is to
evaluate the approach and the control of Q fever. This has been
announced by the Minsters Verburg (Agriculture, LNV) and Klink (Public
Health, VWS) in their letter to Parliament [dated 11 Jan 2010].

The main question to be addressed by the committee is 'How did the
ministries LNV and VWS cope with the ways to handle and fight Q-fever
and what are the lessons to be learned?' The committee will
independently decide whom to approach and which documents are required
for its investigation. Both ministries have pledged their full
cooperation.

The main question has been broken down into 9 questions. The committee
reports to the 2 ministers. They will send the report, together with
their policy response, before the 2010 summer recess to the House.

Professor Gert van Dijk (1946) studied animal breeding and genetics in
Wageningen and Economics in Aberdeen. Van Dijk is the director of the
National Cooperative Council for agriculture and horticulture (NCR),
and since 1990 also professor of cooperative entrepreneurship at the
Nyenrode University [a prestigious Dutch business school and the only
private university in the Netherlands. - Mod.AS]. The other members of
the evaluation committee are yet to be named.

[On 10 Dec 2009, a majority in the Dutch parliament voted in favour of
a resolution proposed by MP's Waalkens and Ormel, demanding an
independent investigation of the way the approach and combat against Q
fever have been managed by the 2 ministries involved since 2007. Among
the issues underlined was the interrelationship between the ministries
and between them and other public agencies involved.

The evaluation committee has been nominated by the 2 ministers
following the above resolution. In their letter to the Parliament, the
ministers explain that additional members of the committee will be
nominated soon, to include human health and veterinary experts, as
well as experts on public administration and communication. The Letter
of Appointment includes the 9 detailed questions; one of them deals
with the communication between the ministries, with the institutions
under their responsibility, with provinces, municipalities, citizens
and businesses. The committee has been requested to perform its
investigation in parallel with the continued Q fever control
activities, and to present its report by 1 Jun 2010. - Mod.AS]
