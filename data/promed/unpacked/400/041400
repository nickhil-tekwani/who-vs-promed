As many as 200 persons, including 70 women and 12 children, have been
affected by suspected Chikungunya fever in Kadathur Block.
According to Health Department officials, the fever had spread from
Puddireddipatti to the nearby villages of Mottankurichi,
Sillarahalli, Nathamedu and Linganaickenahalli in Kadathur Block.
A medical team was camping in the affected villages. The local
administration of the respective villages had announced about the
medical check up through 'tom -tom', they said.
The affected persons were being treated at the villages itself. The
local administration had been directed to chlorinate drinking water
and ensure proper sanitation in all the villages.

Chikungunya fever (CHIK) is a viral disease transmitted to humans by
the bite of infected mosquitoes. CHIK virus is a member of the genus
Alphavirus, in the family Togaviridae. CHIK virus was first isolated
in Tanzania in 1953. The virus circulates throughout much of
Africa and many areas of South East Asia.
CHIK infection can cause a debilitating illness, most often
characterized by fever, headache, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, muscle
pain, rash, and joint pain. The term chikungunya in Swahili is for
that 'which bends up.'
The average incubation period is usually 3-7 days. Acute chikungunya
fever typically lasts a few days to a couple of weeks, but as with
dengue, West Nile fever, o'nyong-nyong fever and other arboviral
fevers, some patients have prolonged fatigue lasting several weeks.
Co-circulation of dengue fever in many areas may mean that
chikungunya fever cases are sometimes clinically misdiagnosed as
dengue infections, therefore the incidence of chikungunya fever could
be much higher than what has been previously reported.
No deaths, neuroinvasive cases, or hemorrhagic cases related to CHIKV
infection have been conclusively documented in the scientific
literature. (The above is borrowed from
