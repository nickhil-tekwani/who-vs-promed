Bird flu discovered at kibbutz
------------------------------
An outbreak of bird flu was discovered Tuesday [26 Jan 2010] night at
a henhouse in Kibbutz Ein Shemer. The disease was found in a henhouse
containing about 43 000 hens. Agriculture Ministry workers began
Tuesday night marking off the birds to be culled. All agricultural
production in the area has been shut down until further notice.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall

[The event, confirmed by the national laboratory to be caused by the
HPAI H5N1 virus, affected a broiler-type breeder pullet farm in
Kibbutz Ein Shemer (Haifa District). The plant is known to have
maintained appropriate precautionary biosecurity management; the
source of infection is under investigation.

According to "Haaretz" daily of 27 Jan 2010, the personnel of the
plant are already undergoing, preventively, Tamiflu treatment. No
human cases have been recorded. All 43 000 chickens in the plant are
to be culled.

Israel's OIE notification on this outbreak is available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=8888>.

Israel's previous H5N1 outbreak, in early January 2008, involved a
single, small backyard pet-bird holding, in Benyamina, 8 km (5 mi)
from the current outbreak. The outbreak remained solitary following
the stamping-out of the affected holding; the source of infection
could not be determined. Israel maintains an intensive avian influenza
surveillance; see
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=6649>.
