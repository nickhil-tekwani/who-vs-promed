Concerning [neurocysticercosis] being a cause of neurological
symptoms in African children
----------------------------------------------------------------------
There is ample evidence that juvenile neurocysticercosis is very
common in endemic areas of South Africa (see Mafojane et al, 2003;
Pro-MED-mail archives 20050506.1254 and 20050521.1407).

We do not know about the situation in other African countries as
studies have not been conducted.

Regarding _Taenia solium_ infections in Uganda:
_T. solium_ is present throughout Uganda as very recent surveys have
indicated porcine cysticercosis to be prevalent nationwide based on
studies conducted in randomly selected districts from different parts
of the country in connection with a FAO Technical Cooperation
Programme supported project and other projects (Waiswa et al, 2009;
personal communication with Prof G Lubega and Dr C Waiswa, Veterinary
Faculty, Makerere University).

Pig keeping and pork consumption are very popular in Uganda, which
has one of the highest and densest populations of pigs on the
continent. Most of these pigs are kept under non-commercial,
smallholder production systems in rural areas whereby the pigs are
allowed to roam about for food in areas where open human defecation
is common and thus they have access to human faeces.

Thus far there have not been any community-based surveys on human
cysticercosis or taeniosis however the German Research Foundation
(DFG) has just awarded a grant to Dr AS Winkler (neurologist,
University of Munich, Germany), Prof William Matuja (neurologist,
Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences, Tanzania), Prof
Emilio Ovuga (psychiatrist and public health specialist, Gulu
University, Uganda), and colleagues to conduct a study on the
association between epilepsy and neurocysticercosis in Uganda and
Tanzania through cross-sectional, community-based evaluations.

With regard to epilepsy and its attribution being due to
onchocerciasis or neurocysticercosis:
Controversy arose last year [2008] concerning epileptic seizures in
Uganda being attributed to onchocerciasis as opposed to
neurocysticercosis as a monitoring programme for onchocerciasis
intervention based on detection of "onchocercomas" indicated that
many of the skin nodules turned out to be caused by subcutaneous
cysticercosis (Katabarwa et al, 2008).

This led the monitoring programme to conclude that the prediction of
nodule prevalence for noninvasive rapid epidemiologic assessment
(REA) to target areas for mass chemotherapy with ivermectin in the
intervention programme-supported areas may have been influenced by
other pathologies and that _T. solium_ infection may actually be the
main cause of "onchocerciasis associated epileptic seizures" in many
onchocerciasis endemic communities that have been causally linked to
onchocerciasis.

However, another team of scientists countered that a positive
correlation between onchocerciasis and epilepsy has been demonstrated
in onchocerciasis endemic areas of Africa where it was unlikely that
the epilepsy was caused by neurocysticercosis though whether the
epilepsy was actually attributable to onchocerciasis is not known
(Kaiser et al, 2008). Both groups of scientists have highlighted the
need to conduct further studies combining appropriate
neuroepidemiologic, clinical, and parasitologic methods to clarify
the etiology of epilepsy in areas both endemic and non-endemic for
onchocerciasis to assess the possible interaction of onchocerciasis
and cysticercosis in co-endemic areas. The new study to be conducted
by Winkler, Matuja, and Ovuga should help clarify the situation.

In any case, neurocysticercosis should be considered as a potential
cause of epilepsy throughout sub-Saharan Africa.
