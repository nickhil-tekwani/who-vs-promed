Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) of the genus Tospovirus, family
Bunyaviridae (1), causes an economically important virus disease in tomato
in several parts of the world. The virus has a wide host range that
includes numerous crops and weeds and is transmitted by at least 7 species
of thrips.
Tomato crops in the Subukia, Bahati, and Kabazi areas of the Nakuru
District in Kenya were affected by a disease suggestive of TSWV infection
during the November 1999 to March 2000 tomato-growing season. Farmers
reported up to 80% losses of their potential yields.
Characteristic symptoms were noticed on fruits, especially when ... green.
Distinct concentric rings on fruits, which later turned into brown, [and
uneven ripening, were the most visible symptoms. Foliage did not develop
pronounced symptoms, but mild bronzing was observed in a few cultivars. ...
Foliage senesced prematurely, starting with older leaves. Foliar symptoms
were mistaken for blight infection, and as a result, excessive fungicides
were applied that failed to manage the disease.
... Tomato leaf samples collected from the fields were tested initially
with a TSWV test kit (HortiTech, Horticulture Research International,
Wellesbourne, UK), and the results were confirmed by double-antibody
sandwich-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with antibodies from Agdia Inc.
(Elkhart, IN).
Further molecular characterization was done using ... RT-PCR. Total RNA was
extracted from symptomatic leaves of tomato cv. Money Maker using the
RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). Using primers 5' TTAAGC
AAGTTCTGTGAG 3' and 5' ATGTCTAAGGTTAAGCTC 3' specific to the nucleoprotein
(N) gene of TSWV, the N gene was amplified by RT-PCR (2).
[The expected 777-bp product ... was obtained from symptomatic plants,
whereas no amplification was obtained from noninfected tomato. The PCR
product was cloned into pGEM-T Easy Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced. A
search of GenBank revealed a sequence identity of 95 to 99% with the N
genes of known TSWV isolates.
To our knowledge, this is the first report TSWV infection of tomato in
Kenya. Considering its wide host range, future surveys should be directed
toward estimating its incidence in tomato and other TSWV-susceptible crops,
such as Irish potatoes, pepper, peanut (groundnut), beans, and a wide
variety of ornamental cut flowers in Kenya.

[The genus Tospovirus contains 8 species with TSWV as the type species.
Tospoviruses infect many food crops that ProMED-Plant monitors worldwide,
including peanut (groundnut), pepper, bean, soybean, cowpea, tomato, pea,
and potato. TSWV itself infects more than 925 species in 70 botanical
families. Demarcation of species is based on vector specificity, plant host
range, serological relationships of the N (nucleocapsid) protein and N
protein sequence. These viruses are transmitted by at least 5 species of
thrips in the genus _Frankliniella_ and 3 species in the genus _Thrips_.
The disease is difficult to control under field conditions because of the
mobility of the thrips vectors and the wide host range of the virus. Under
greenhouse conditions spray regimens can be implemented to reduce vector
populations, but it is necessary to use a range of different classes of
chemicals in rotation in order to reduce the likelihood of emerging
resistant populations. Total crop losses are not uncommon.
