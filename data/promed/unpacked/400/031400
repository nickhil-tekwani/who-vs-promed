News of the response

New health zone affected: Kayina
--------------------------------
- 3 new confirmed cases, including 2 community deaths, were detected in the same family in the Kayina health zone [North Kivu]. This is the 18th health area affected by the Ebola epidemic. The central office of the Kayina health zone was alerted to the presence of people with Ebola-compatible symptoms in their territory. A registered nurse visited the home concerned on 13 Jan 2019 and [took] 3 samples that were sent to Butembo. The 3 samples returned positive and 2 of the 3 patients died meanwhile on 14 Jan 2019.

- Investigations are underway to determine the health zone in which the 3 people were infected and to identify the chain of transmission.

- A joint team of epidemiologists, communicators, vaccinators, and WASH [water, sanitation and hygiene] experts (prevention and control of infections) arrived in Kayina to launch priority actions to contain the epidemic in this area. A reinforcement of the teams at the health zone of Lubero is also planned.

Vaccination
-----------
- Since the start of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 61 201 people have been vaccinated , including 19 990 in Beni [North Kivu], 12 815 in Katwa [North Kivu], 6796 in Butembo [North Kivu], 5741 in Mabalako [North Kivu], 2433 in Kalunguta [North Kivu], 2080 in Komanda [Ituri], 1751 in Goma [North Kivu], 1663 in Mandima [Ituri], 1406 in Oicha [North Kivu], 1157 in Karisimbi [North Kivu], 877 in Vuhovi [North Kivu], 750 in Masereka [North Kivu], 735 in Kyondo [North Kivu], 700 in Lubero [North Kivu], 599 in Mutwanga [North Kivu], 442 in Musienene [North Kivu], 434 in Bunia [Ituri], 355 in Tchomia [Ituri], 167 in Nyankunde [Ituri], 120 in Biena [North Kivu], 63 in Alimbongo [North Kivu], 54 in Nyiragongo [North Kivu], and 13 in Kisangani [Tshopo].

The only vaccine to be used in this outbreak is the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, manufactured by the pharmaceutical group Merck, following approval by the Ethics Committee in its decision of 19 May 2018.

[The virus continues to spread in the DRC, this time to a new health zone, Kayina, North Kivu. The actions being taken in Kayina should help contain spread. Fortunately, there are still no reports of virus detected in neighboring countries. One hopes the registered nurse was not infected when treating the infected patients in their home. - Mod.LK]

7 weeks ago, tomorrow, the North Kivu outbreak became the 2nd largest on record, surpassing the 2000 Gulu outbreak (425 cases). Since [29 Nov 2018], the North Kivu case count has grown by 237 cases, an increase of 55%.

With +5 cases today, the number of new #Ebola cases has risen by 29 in the past 4 days. That's closer to the rate before the election-related violence slowed down surveillance and control activities.]

News of the response

Community solidarity
--------------------
During 27 and 28 Dec 2018 demonstrations in Beni due to the postponement of elections in the region, angry protesters deliberately vandalized, looted, or burned several community health centers, including Rwangoma [North Kivu].

On Mon 14 Jan 2019, the population of the district of Rwangoma undertook, at its expense, the rehabilitation of their health center. The district officials received a contribution of 500 Congolese francs [USD 0.305] from each inhabitant to contribute to the rehabilitation of the health care structure.

- Thu 17 Jan 209. WHO expert: Ebola outbreak to continue at least 6 more months
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease research and Policy), edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/01/who-expert-ebola-outbreak-continue-least-6-more-months
[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

In an interview, Peter Salama, MD, the World Health Organization's (WHO's) deputy director-general for emergency preparedness and response, said the current Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is likely to continue for at least another 6 months, as DRC officials today confirmed 5 new cases.

"This is the most complicated setting we've ever experienced in order to stop an Ebola outbreak," said Salama. "At a minimum, it will take 6 further months to stop."

Salama made the sobering prediction alongside some promising developments, including a decrease of cases in Beni, the most active outbreak hot spot, which hasn't seen any new cases in nearly 2 weeks.

"If we can control the outbreak in Beni, we can do it anywhere," Salama said. Now, the focus is on Butembo and Katwa, areas with nearly 1 million people. Other hot spots include Komanda and Oicha, but Salama said caseloads are lighter there.

"I feel we will be able to get on top of those with access, which will leave Butembo and Katwa as the main priority," said Salama.

The outbreak, which began in August [2018] in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, has been marred by community resistance, population movement, violence against heath workers, and political instability. These factors have limited the response efforts at times and have allowed the disease to continue to take hold of communities.

"Though this is the 10th outbreak in the DRC, this is a community and region that has never seen Ebola. There was no baseline knowledge among healthcare workers of in the community about the disease," said Salama.

100 workers recently added
--------------------------
The WHO now has 450 personnel working in DRC on the outbreak, with 100 of the workers added just in the last month, Salama said. "This is a massive deployment, but people with the ability and willingness to deploy aren't exactly growing on trees," he said.

The instability and danger are factors limiting more healthcare workers from the outbreak zone, while another is language, as fluency in both French and Swahili is most useful.

While human resources have stretched during the outbreak, Salama said doses of Merck's unlicensed VSV-EBOV vaccine and in-field Ebola testing kits are in good supply.

"Merck has 300 000 doses in the global supply, and we've used about 60 000 so far, so we have some buffer," he said. The goal is to have 2 licensed vaccine products in the global stockpile by 2020, because that would assist with vaccine production ramp-up.

"Were the outbreak to become a multi-country outbreak, then we would quickly face critical vaccine shortages," said Salama.

Why the high rates in children?
-------------------------------
Salama also shared a working hypothesis he and WHO team members developed to explain the high proportion of cases in young children, those under 5 and under 1 year, during this outbreak.

"There are an enormous number of informal health facilities in Beni, Butembo, and Katwa. In Beni [there are] around 400 that are not regulated and had never been mapped, so no one could have told you how many there were, where they were, who staffed them, or what kind of services they supplied," Salama said.

These facilities are known locally as "tradi-moderns," or traditional-modern health centers. They are private businesses, and employees do not need any medical licenses or certificates.

"We believe they had a tremendous impact on transmission," Salama said. "We saw in November [2018] a trend of children being infected, and we were able to detect cases associated with a relatively small number of facilities."

The Ebola infections occurred at the same time of a malaria outbreak.

"Unbeknownst to anyone, children were sharing rooms with Ebola patients who were not suspected or diagnosed, and there were no medical records taken," Salama said.

Kayina [North Kivu] is the 18th health district involved in this outbreak, and the site of 2 community deaths. The DRC said the cases in Kayina are family members.

Ebola infects 5 more in DRC outbreak, 663 total
-----------------------------------------------
The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) Ebola outbreak grew by 5 cases today [16 Jan 2019], with illnesses reported in 4 different locations, according to the health ministry's daily update.

Of the latest confirmed cases, 2 are from Katwa, with one each reported in Butembo, Kyondo, and Oicha. The illnesses bring the outbreak number to 663, which includes 614 confirmed and 49 probable cases. Health officials are still investigating 123 suspected Ebola cases, down from 200 noted yesterday [15 Jan 2019].

Five new deaths were reported, including 3 that occurred in community settings in Katwa, Butembo, and Kyondo. Community deaths raise the risk of further transmission, because the patients weren't isolated and caregivers likely weren't protected at a point during illnesses when viral levels are highest. The 2 other deaths were reported from the Butembo Ebola treatment center.

- Tue 15 Jan 2019. Ebola cases grow by 9, including 1 in new area
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease research and Policy), abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/01/ebola-cases-grow-9-including-1-new-area
[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

Today [15 Jan 2019] the Democratic Republic of the Congo's (DRC's) ministry of health recorded 9 new cases of Ebola, including one case in Manguredjipa [North Kivu], a newly affected health zone, and the 17th in the ongoing outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces.

The new cases bring the outbreak total to 658, with 609 cases confirmed and 402 deaths. 200 cases are still under investigation, which is up from 121 yesterday [14 Jan 2019].

The case in Manguredjipa is linked to an outbreak in the Aloya health area of the Mabalako health zone [North Kivu], DRC officials said.

6 new deaths; vaccinations top 60 000
-------------------------------------
Since yesterday [14 Jan 2019], 6 new deaths were recorded, including 5 community deaths. These types of deaths take place outside a healthcare or treatment center setting and thus increase the risk of community transmission.

The ring vaccination campaign has now reached 60 460 people.

The ministry of health also said that efforts began yesterday to rebuild a community health center in Rwangoma that was destroyed during the election protests held in the last week of December. The rehabilitation was funded by community donations.

10 health districts still active
------------------------
On Twitter, Peter Salama, MD, the World Health Organization's deputy director-general for emergency preparedness and response, said the outbreak is likely active in 10 of the 17 affected health zones, with cases in Beni and Mangina on the decline.

According to epidemiologic graphs, Mabalako and Mandima were the first outbreak epicenters in late July and August, and Beni saw the most cases through the fall months. Recently, Butembo and Katwa have seen more cases.

"The Ebola outbreak in DRC is really several distinct outbreaks in the different affected areas. This means (1) interpreting overall epidemiological trends is complex, and (2) the response has to be adapted to the very different contexts in each area. We can't 'cut and paste,' " Salama said.

The current outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo is the 2nd deadliest in history, killing more than 400 people and infecting hundreds more. Its location in both an active conflict zone and a busy border region has created what one of those leading the response describes as a "perfect storm" of risk for central Africa.

Since the outbreak erupted in August [2018], a massive response effort has built up around the epicentres in eastern North Kivu and Ituri provinces. It now involves hundreds of Congolese officials and World Health Organization staff, as well as hundreds of local and international aid and health workers. But a lesser-known parallel effort is also underway -- within Congo but also in neighbouring countries -- to ensure that a regional epidemic like the one that claimed more than 11 000 lives in West Africa in 2013-2016 isn't repeated.

Weeks of IRIN reporting, including trips to assess efforts in border areas, revealed some intensive monitoring and tight collaboration, especially between Congo and Uganda, but also a realization from health officials of the extreme difficulty of policing thousands of kilometres of porous frontier in a busy trading area prone to spiralling violence.

At the Kasindi border between eastern Congo and Uganda, a line of people waits to make the crossing. Before they get their documents checked, they stand -- forehead first -- in front of a hygiene official in a surgical mask who screens them with an infrared thermo-gun. Those found to have higher-than-normal body temperatures are tested further for Ebola-like symptoms.

This screening station -- just a simple wood and tarp gazebo, some plastic outdoor furniture, and a makeshift water tank for hand-washing -- represents the front line of the cross-border system trying to prevent the deadly Ebola virus from spreading from one country to the next. More than a dozen similar stations are now dotted along the Congo-Uganda border, health ministers from both countries told IRIN. Across the border in Uganda, 22 of the highest risk areas have implemented additional monitoring measures to try and ensure Ebola stays out.

Between 20 000 and 30 000 back-and-forth crossings -- most by informal traders or people with cultural and family links -- take place between the 2 countries each day, according to Congolese border officials. These large human flows have become a major challenge for those involved in the Ebola response.

"People are crossing borders all the time," Peter Salama, the WHO's deputy director-general for emergency preparedness and response, told IRIN. "The challenge really is just the sheer volume of people. It requires a real level of cross-country collaboration to be able to ensure that a case on one side of the border is adequately traced on the other side of the border."

Fears of a cross-border epidemic aren't restricted to Uganda, which is closest to the current outbreak. They also stretch to Rwanda, Burundi, and South Sudan.

Up to 60 000 people cross between Rwanda and Congo daily, according to the Red Cross; while Congo's ministry of health said more than 24 000 people cross between Congo and Burundi each month, and another 3000 each month between Congo and South Sudan.

Travel within Congo is also a concern -- Ebola has already spread from an initial epicentre near Beni to more densely populated areas, such as the major trading hub of Butembo, home to more than one million people.

"The context for this outbreak is a perfect storm," said Salama. "There's the combination of great insecurity that has been going on for decades - now increasing in severity and frequency -- a highly mobile and also very dense population in urban areas, proximity to international borders, major logistical challenges, and of course the fact that all of this is occurring in an election period."

Together with the WHO and health NGOs, the governments of neighbouring countries say they have strengthened cross-border collaboration to keep the outbreak from spreading. The health ministers of Congo and Uganda told IRIN in December [2018] that they are working closely together to screen travellers and track potential cases. Salama said more than 18 million people have already been screened across various points of entry.

[4] Research
Date: Thu 17 Jan 2019
Source: ScienceDaily, Texas Biomedical Research Institute report [abridged, edited]
https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/01/190117090438.htm


A team of researchers have discovered the interaction between an Ebola virus protein and a protein in human cells that may be an important key to unlocking the pathway of replication of the killer disease in human hosts. Scientists at Texas Biomedical Research Institute were part of a nationwide collaborative with scientists at Gladstone Institutes, UC San Francisco and Georgia State University for a study recently published in the journal Cell.

Scientists around the globe are trying to pinpoint potential drug targets to stop Ebola virus disease.

Texas Biomed Staff Scientist Olena Shtanko, PhD, describes this new work as a "turning point for understanding how replication of Ebola virus is modulated."

Earlier research by scientists in California used a protein interaction map to narrow down host and virus protein interactions and then using a yeast system and an artificial proxy virus system proved the theory of this particular protein-protein interaction. However, scientists needed to use replicating virus and human immune cells to test the clinical significance of the finding.

"The interaction is important if you can show functional significance of what it does to the virus in cells that have clinical relevance," Shtanko stressed. "If you can figure out the mechanism within these cells, then you can potentially manipulate it and stop the disease progression."

Texas Biomed Staff Scientist Eusondia Arnett, PhD, and Texas Biomed President and CEO Dr Larry Schlesinger -- both tuberculosis researchers -- have expertise in working with human macrophage (immune) cells drawn from donated blood samples. "We were able to capitalize on our experience with macrophages to over- and under-express the RBBP6 (host) protein to create an effective model for this important Ebola virus research," Arnett said.

By over- and under-expressing the RBBP6, Shtanko was able to test what impact the protein had on the growth of Ebola virus in the macrophages. Shtanko said the results were striking. When the host protein was under-expressed, the viral replication went up exponentially. She found similar results when working with vascular cells, which are also key to Ebola virus replication in an infected patient.

Summary
-------
Ebola virus (EBOV) infection often results in fatal illness in humans, yet little is known about how EBOV usurps host pathways during infection. To address this, we used affinity tag-purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) to generate an EBOV-host protein-protein interaction (PPI) map. We uncovered 194 high-confidence EBOV-human PPIs, including one between the viral transcription regulator VP30 and the host ubiquitin ligase RBBP6. Domain mapping identified a 23 amino acid region within RBBP6 that binds to VP30. A crystal structure of the VP30-RBBP6 peptide complex revealed that RBBP6 mimics the viral nucleoprotein (NP) binding to the same interface of VP30. Knockdown of endogenous RBBP6 stimulated viral transcription and increased EBOV replication, whereas overexpression of either RBBP6 or the peptide strongly inhibited both. These results demonstrate the therapeutic potential of biologics that target this interface and identify additional PPIs that may be leveraged for novel therapeutic strategies.
