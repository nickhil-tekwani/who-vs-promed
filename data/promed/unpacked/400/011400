In a communication this [Wed 1 Aug 2018] CREAF [Ecological and Forestry Applications Research Centre] reports that the _Aedes japonicus_ mosquito has arrived for the 1st time in Spain in southern Europe, according to the 1st [Rapid Risk Evaluation report] issued by the [Coordination Center for Alerts and Health Emergencies] this July [2018], as a consequence of an alert from Asturias via the "Mosquito Alert" platform. [CREAF is a European public research center dedicated to terrestrial ecology and territorial analysis, producing knowledge and methodologies for conservation, management, and adaptation of the environment to global change.]

At the beginning of June [2018], the citizen science platform "Mosquito Alert" platform received a photo of a suspicious mosquito via an app sent from the area of Siero in the Asturias Principality. After receiving this 1st notification, the person who sent the email was requested to send specimens of adults and larvae, from which the suspicions were confirmed.

Later, a field inspection was done in the place where they were found, led by the "Mosquito Alert" entomologists together with members of the entomological team of the University of Zaragoza and those responsible for the Entomological Surveillance project of the Ministry of Health, Consumers and Social Welfare.

The head of the team of entomologists of "Mosquito Alert", Roger Eritja, has stated, "After inspecting the area we have been able to find all the biological stages of this vector in various points far from each other, which suggests that the mosquito is now established in an area that could be much more extensive, although more studies are necessary to confirm this."

The major concern is that with the arrival of the _A. japonicus_ mosquito, apart from being a pest with its bites that are similar to those of other mosquitoes, it has the ability to transmit various viruses among which, the most relevant for Spain, would be West Nile virus.

Under laboratory conditions is has also been proven that it is able to be infected by dengue and chikungunya [viruses], although the experts and the authorities remark that at the present time the risk that these mosquitoes could transmit these diseases [viruses] autochthonously [locally] in Spain is very low.

"One must consider that the risk of transmission of these diseases depends on the quantity of mosquitoes present and if the virus is circulating the population. On the other hand, there are other factors such as the contact that may exist between the vector and host. Currently, we do not believe that the quantity of mosquitoes is very high and the other conditions exist in Asturias either," explained Eritja.

In the current situation, "Mosquito Alert" encourages the people in Asturias and neighboring communities to download the app and collaborate actively with these delimiting studies, sending as many mosquito images as is possible.

Platform director
---------------
"This finding shows once more the utility of the "Mosquito Alert" platform as a surveillance tool for early detection of invasive mosquitoes," highlighted the Director of the platform, Frederic Bartumeus.

"We remember from before the tiger mosquito [_A. albopictus_] that had been found and now it is _A. japonicus_, and we continue looking for the yellow fever mosquito [_A aegypti_]," added the director.

One hopes that during the next months the experts will carry out more studies in the area to better determine the affected areas and, if it is possible, determine the origin of the arrival of this mosquito.

The authorities recommend that the citizenry apply the control measures to avoid the proliferation of the invading mosquitoes, such as the tiger mosquito that now extends along the entire Spanish coast and some points in the interior.

Some of this advice is avoid accumulation of water in residential areas and go to the doctor if mosquito bites evolve unfavorably.

Characteristics of the mosquito
-------------------------------
The _A. japonicus_ mosquitoes can reminds one of the tiger or the yellow fever mosquito because of its stripes, but in reality they are different. _A. japonicus_ is much larger than the other 2, it is brown in color and as a characteristic feature has golden stripes on the thorax. It can fly long distances and is very resistant to cold; it breeds in flooded spaces such as tires, vases, depressions including puddles in rocks and its biting activity is during the day and at dusk.

Neither too urban nor too aggressive
------------------------------------
In contrast with the tiger mosquito it is neither as urban nor as aggressive [in biting] people and is often found in wooded areas.

[_Aedes albopictus_ is established in many Mediterranean Basin countries including the coast of Spain (http://www.conops.gr/mosquito-maps/?lang=en#prettyPhoto/0/). This mosquito is becoming established in continental Europe. Its current known distribution as of June 2018 is mainly in northeastern France, southwestern and central Germany (https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/ese.17.04.20067-en), Lichtenstein, Switzerland, and Austria; a map is available at https://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/aedes-japonicus-current-known-distribution-june-2018).

As the report above mentions, it remains to be seen just how much of a public health risk this mosquito poses in Europe, including Spain, as a vector of important arboviruses. - Mod.TY
