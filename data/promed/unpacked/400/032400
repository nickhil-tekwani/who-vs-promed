An Alaska-based salmon wholesaler is recalling all of its smoked products because some may not be properly cooked and could be contaminated with the potentially deadly bacteria that lead to botulism.

Big Blue Fisheries in Sitka, Alaska, announced the recall Mon 30 Sep 2013, in cooperation with the Food and Drug Administration. All smoked products from all lots and codes, various sizes, in vacuum packages are subject to the recall, and include cod and different salmon varieties.

The products were distributed locally in Alaska, and wholesale nationwide between 24 Sep 2011 and 24 Sep 2013. Products were sold in vacuum packed plastic packages with labels located on the front that include the pack date and AK#604, according to the release.

[The FDA recall can be accessed at http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm370510.htm. Photos of the recalled product labels can be seen at http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm370511.htm. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ

Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most of the food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures, which could, but not necessarily do, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_.

It should be noted that the FDA this year (2013) has approved the 1st heptavalent [good against all 7 strains] equine derived botulinum antiserum for the treatment of botulism disease (http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm345128.htm). - Mod.LL
