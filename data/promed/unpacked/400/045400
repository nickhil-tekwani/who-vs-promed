According to the Philippines Department of Agriculture (DA), 2 fungal diseases are prevalent now and threatening the rice crops in Iloilo province.

Around 3155 hectares [about 7800 acres] were already affected by rice blast. DA officials said frequent rains and winds damaged the plants contributing to the disease. In addition, sheath blight is also threatening rice crops.

[Rice blast
----------
Rice blast is caused by the fungus _Pyricularia oryzae_ (synonym _Magnaporthe oryzae_). It is one of the most destructive diseases of the crop worldwide, with potential yield losses of more than 50 per cent. Symptoms include lesions on all parts of the shoot, as well as stem rot and panicle blight. When nodes are infected, all plant parts above the infection die and yield losses are severe. When infection occurs at the seedling or tillering stages, plants are often completely killed. Depending on which plant parts are affected, the disease may manifest itself as leaf, collar, node, or neck blast. More than 50 species of grasses and sedges can be affected by related pathogens, but most strains isolated from rice can only infect a limited number of cultivars.

Symptom severity and spread of the blast fungus are influenced by climatic conditions. The disease is also favoured by high nitrogen levels (for example from fertilizers) and high humidity. The fungus is spread by infected plant debris, mechanical means (including insect activity), water and wind. Disease management may include fungicides and cultural practices but relies mainly on resistant varieties. However, the fungus is highly variable and this favours the emergence of new strains with increased virulence.

Sheath blight
-------------
Sheath blight of rice is caused by the fungus _Thanatephorus cucumeris_ (previously _Rhizoctonia solani_), a ubiquitous soil borne fungus. Symptoms include lesions on the leaf sheath just above the water or soil level. Lesions expand upwards on the sheaths and spread to the leaves and then to neighbouring tillers and other plants. Under favourable conditions, infection spreads rapidly in the field. Yield losses of up to 50 per cent are reported due to poorly filled grain heads and reduced plant vigour.

Fungal sclerotia survive for long periods in the soil and float to the surface of flooded rice fields causing infection in the next crop. Some weed hosts can serve as pathogen reservoirs. No reliable source of genetic host resistance has been identified so far. Disease management includes cultural and phytosanitary techniques and foliar fungicides. The possible emergence of strains with fungicide resistances (for example, see ProMED-mail post 20130905.1926343) is causing concern for rice producers worldwide.

_T. cucumeris_ is associated with "rhizoctonia" diseases such as damping-off, root rot, basal stem rot (foot rot) and fruit rot, in a large number of crops. Its wide host range includes cereals, pasture grasses, oilseed rape and pulses, making it difficult to control by crop rotation.
