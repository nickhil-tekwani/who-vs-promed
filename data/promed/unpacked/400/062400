RABIES, RACCOONS - VACCINES: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
====================================================
From: Motleyone@aol.com
date: Wed, 14 May 1997 22:12:33 -0400
I received Fel-o-vac PCT-R vaccine instead of my normal Fel-o-vac PCT
which I have been giving to raccoons which are raised for release back
into the wild. This is given to prevent raccoon parvo which is a deviant
of feline distemper, and is given at 6wks/9wks/12wks.
Normally would give either IMRAB 1 or RAVAC 1 separately.
Fel-o-vac is a killed vaccine made from mice brain tissue according to
Fort Dodge and would not give raccoons rabies, however no guarantee of
protection from Rabies. Of course there is no guarantee with Imrab or
Ravac either.
What I don't want to do is harm the raccoons. Should I return the vaccine
or use it?
Any help would be appreciated. Thank you.
[It would appear the most important question is which vaccine gives the
best protection to raccoons from rabies infection - not a trivial question
in North Carolina because of our epidemic in wildlife. So, a vaccinated
raccoon is the way to go but maybe our subscribers can provide information
on the best vaccine for raccoons. Maybe not. However, the killed vaccine,
because it it killed, should not be a threat to the raccoons - Mod. p.c.]
