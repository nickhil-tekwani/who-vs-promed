H7 strain bird flu case registered in Shumen, Bulgaria
------------------------------------------------------
A case of bird flu of the H7 strain was registered in Bulgaria's northern
town of Shumen, officials reported Friday [1 Feb 2008]. The virus has been
found in a killed wild duck in Kamchiya River valley, between the villages
of Khan Krum and Milanovo.

"The H7 strain is proved dangerous for the birds but we still cannot claim
it could not affect people as well," the director of the regional
veterinary medicine service Hristo Hristov said. "The migratory bird was
just a carrier of the virus," he added.

The authorities guaranteed they are to take immediate precautionary
measures for stopping the virus' spread and called on the local people not
to panic. The deadly H5N1 strain of avian influenza emerged in South East
Asia in 2003, taking the lives of 180 people, with Indonesia hit the worst.
It has spread throughout the world, causing millions of poultry to be
culled as a precautionary measure.

Several south eastern European countries have undergone bird flu scares
since 2005, most notably Romania, which has spent millions in hard currency
on flu vaccines and to destroy infected birds to prevent its spread.

[Bulgaria has submitted an "immediate notification" on the said finding to
the OIE (Office International des Epizooties). Under the title "highly
pathogenic avian influenza H7", the notification described "sub-clinical
infection" in "one shot mallard duck (_Anas Platyrhynchos_)." See at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=6752>.


According to chapter 2.7.12 "Avian influenza" in OIE's Terrestrial animal
health code (2007 edition), avian influenza in its notifiable form (NAI) is
defined as "an infection of poultry caused by any influenza A virus of the
H5 or H7 subtypes or by any AI virus with an intravenous pathogenicity
index (IVPI) greater than 1.2 (or as an alternative at least 75 per cent
mortality). NAI viruses can be divided into highly pathogenic notifiable
avian influenza (HPNAI) and low pathogenicity notifiable avian influenza
(LPNAI). For further details, including data on the methods applied to
determine the virus pathogenicity index, see the above chapter at
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/mcode/en_chapitre_2.7.12.htm> and the relevant
chapter in OIE's Terrestrial Manual.

The said chapter includes the following statement: "For the purposes of
international trade, a country should not impose immediate trade bans in
response to a notification of infection with HPAI and LPAI virus in birds
other than poultry." It includes the following definition of poultry: "All
domesticated birds, including backyard poultry, used for the production of
meat or eggs for consumption, for the production of other commercial
products, for restocking supplies of game, or for breeding these categories
of birds, as well as fighting cocks used for any purpose," and further
states: "Birds that are kept in captivity for any reason other than those
reasons referred to in the preceding paragraph, including those that are
kept for shows, races, exhibitions, competitions, breeding or selling these
categories of birds as well as pet birds, are not considered to be poultry."
