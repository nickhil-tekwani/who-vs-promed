Concern Over New Cases of Meningitis in Santa Lucia
---------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Public Health has informed that over the last 3 weeks there
has been an average of 1 new case of meningitis every 7 days in the city of
Santa Lucia (Canelones).
With a population of 18 500, Santa Lucia has already had 11 cases of
meningitis, while the total number of infected people in the country is
barely 31, according to data provided by Luis Fraschini, Minister of Public
Health.
The Secretary of State warned that despite the number of cases registered
in that city, it is not yet an epidemic.
Carlos Gimenez, director of the Santa Lucia (Canelones) Health Care Center,
commented that the residents are extremely nervous and that the ministry
will have to "do something." Gimenez added that while the scientific
reasons provided by the Epidemiology Department are understandable, they
must understand that people are anxious. The deaths of 2 girls of 15 and 17
are very sad, and it is very difficult to explain to the parents that, due
to problems with the percentage of effectiveness of the Cuban vaccine, the
Ministry does not administer it to the adolescents of Santa Lucia.
The measures implemented by the Ministry when a new case was reported were
to confirm the diagnosis and transfer the patient as soon as possible, and
administer antibiotics to those close to the patient.
Santa Lucia became newsworthy last May, when, one by one, the cases of
meningitis appeared. During the months of May and June, there were 7 cases
of type B meningitis, and a 17-year-old patient died.
The epidemiology authorities indicated that the disease would be contained
after these cases and that is what happened. However, 2 weeks ago a new
case of meningitis B was detected in a 15-year-old girl who died a few
hours after being hospitalized. Then 3 other cases were diagnosed.
For the time being, no institution can explain what is happening in Santa
Lucia. It is known that of the 11 cases registered, 9 were bacterial and 2
viral. Both patients who died had contracted bacterial meningitis. The
majority of cases were from families of lower-middle class.
Of the 11 patients, 10 had serotype B meningitis. The appearance of this
subtype seems obvious: after massive vaccination campaigns against both
serotypes, meningitis A and C are almost non-existent in Uruguay.

[Epidemics and outbreaks of meningococcal disease caused by serogroup B
have been known to occur in South America since 1974, and serogroup B
disease has been considered endemic in Brazil since 1997. The vaccine
licensed in the USA does not include the capsular polysaccharide of
serogroup B because it is poorly immunogenic. Other vaccine preparations
that include serogroup B antigens have been used in South America with
efficacy reported in the 60-80% range. I presume the Cuban vaccine
referenced in this article to be one of those preparations. For further
