Flooding at a decades-old animal burial site in Russia has raised fears of anthrax infection, it's reported.

Infected livestock was buried near the village of Leninskoye in 1922, 1955, and 1980, but a recent deluge that left the site 80 cm -- more than 2.5 feet -- under water is troubling local authorities, reports news agency Interfax. There's a river a couple of miles away and people living in the area drink water from wells, it seems. Veterinary officials are testing water and soil samples, while all cattle in the area are being inoculated, the report says.

Scientist Louis Pasteur developed the 1st effective vaccine for anthrax in 1881. But its endospores can survive in soil for years, enduring extreme conditions. In 2009, exploratory work for London's new cross-city rail scheme was halted for tests on uncovered human bone fragments amid fears anthrax remained present in an area where 682 victims were buried in 1520. Russia's latest scare follows the infection of 2 farm workers in the southern Stavropol region earlier this month [August 2013]. On that occasion, an unregistered sheep was reported to have been the source [see previous ProMED-mail posting 20130807.1869434].

[Leninskoye is not an uncommon name in the old Soviet Union countries. Searching the web, I found the following on Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leninsky,_Russia):
1. Leninskoye, Kirov Oblast, an urban-type settlement in Shabalinsky District of Kirov Oblast;
2. Leninskoye, Altai Krai, a selo in Smolensky District of Altai Krai;
3. Leninskoye, Jewish Autonomous Oblast, a selo in Leninsky District of the Jewish Autonomous Oblast.

If any livestock die, I presume we might hear of it, with more exact information. However, the Russian authorities are wise to be cautious. My good colleague, Antonio Fasanella, has recovered viable spores from a number of cattle grave sites over the years; some of which were subsequent to outbreaks in cattle grazing the same field. The believed mechanism of risk is that the flooding floats the hydrophobic spores up from the deep buried carcass to the soil surface. The subsequent flush of forage growth attracts the grazing animals to that specific place, which may be only a few square metres, and bingo! you start finding dead cattle.

Once you know what to look for, these graves are relatively easy to recognise. After rain, look for places with standing water. When the carcass(es) were buried they were bloated; when they decompose it leaves a buried airspace which then collapses; so that the surface of the actual grave will now be some 8 to 15 cm lower than the surrounding area -- hard to see in dry weather, but obvious when filled with rainwater. And the best technique for demonstrating anthrax spores in grave soil is Antonio's GABRI technique: see Antonio Fasanella, et al. 2013. Ground anthrax bacillus refined isolation (GABRI) method for analyzing environmental samples with low levels of _Bacillus anthracis_ contamination.
