An expert panel has been set up to weigh the risk of an emerging epidemic
of the new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the British Government said
yesterday.
Sir Kenneth Calman, Chief Medical Officer, announced the formation of a
sub-group of the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee to review
data on nvCJD and to spot emerging trends.
The special epidemiology group will be chaired by Peter Smith of the London
School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
