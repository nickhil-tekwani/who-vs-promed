Outbreaks of Hand, Foot & Mouth Disease in Bangkok and Khon Kaen
----------------------------------------------------------------
A child-care centre in Bangkok closed its doors yesterday after 14 children
came down with hand, foot and mouth disease. The outbreak started on Tue 18
Jun 2002 when 4 or 5 children from the Rainbow Land Child Development
Centre on Convent road in Silom came down with flu-like symptoms and red
spots on their hands and feet, as well as minor mouth sores. Principal Gail
Phillip said the centre contacted a doctor at Bangkok Nursing Home who
diagnosed the complaint as hand, foot and mouth disease, an infectious
disease caused by [an] enterovirus.
Darika Kingnate, chief of the emerging infectious diseases section at the
Department of Communicable Diseases Control, said the [causative]
enterovirus was usually found in the human intestine. The disease is
usually found in children aged under 5 years, with 20-30 cases reported
each year.
Symptoms normally disappear after 7 days. Krit Hiranrat, director of city
hall's Health Department, inspected the centre and said it seemed clean and
hygienic. Children may have contracted the virus from urine and waste and
spread it to each other while playing, he said. Dr Krit said the virus that
causes the disease here is different from that in Singapore, where 200
schools were once forced to close.
Public Health Minister Sudarat Keyuraphan, meanwhile, said 53 similar cases
had been reported in Khon Kaen province. Health staff had been asked to
look for the source of the outbreak.

[Various enteroviruses have been associated with outbreaks of hand, foot
and mouth disease in South-east Asia., often co-circulating in the same
outbreak. It would be difficult to establish unequivocally that the
causative agent in the current outbreak in Thailand differs from that in
past outbreaks in Singapore in the absence of a comprehensive study. - Mod.CP]
