[1] Nasal vaccine
Date: Thu 3 Feb 2022

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/02/health/covid-vaccine-nasal.html


On the outskirts of this centuries-old Indian city [Hyderabad], a world away from its congested roads and cacophony, the gleaming modern laboratories of Bharat Biotech are churning out a COVID vaccine that would be sprayed into the nose rather than injected into the arm.

Currently available vaccines produce powerful, long-lasting immunity against severe illness, as several studies have recently shown. But their protection against infection from the coronavirus is transient, and can falter as new variants of the virus emerge -- a failing that has prompted talk of regular booster shots.

Nasal vaccines may be the best way to prevent infections long term, because they provide protection exactly where it is needed to fend off the virus: the mucosal linings of the airways, where the coronavirus first lands.

Bharat Biotech is among the world's leading vaccine manufacturers. Its best known product, Covaxin, is authorized to prevent COVID in India and many other countries. But its experimental nasal vaccine may prove to be the real game changer.

Immunizing entire populations with a nasal or oral vaccine would be faster in the middle of a surge than injections, which require skill and time to administer. A nasal vaccine is likely to be more palatable to many (including children) than painful shots, and would circumvent shortages of needles, syringes and other materials.

Intranasal vaccines "can be administered easily in mass immunization campaigns and reduce transmission," said Krishna Ella, chairman and managing director of Bharat Biotech.

There are at least a dozen other nasal vaccines in development worldwide, some of them now in Phase 3 trials. But Bharat Biotech's may be the first to become available. In January [2022], the company won approval to begin a Phase 3 trial of the nasal spray in India as a booster for people who have already received 2 shots of a COVID vaccine.

The omicron variant made it all too clear that even 3 doses of a vaccine, while they provide powerful protection against severe illness, may not prevent infection. That's because injected vaccines produce antibodies in the blood, comparatively few of which make it to the nose, the entryway for the virus.

So-called mucosal vaccines ideally would coat the mucosal surfaces of the nose, mouth and throat with long-lasting antibodies, and would be much better at preventing infection and spread of the virus. It is the difference between planting sentries at the gates to bar intruders and trying to oust them after they had already stormed the castle.

Nasal vaccines are "the only way to really circumvent person-to-person transmission," said Jennifer Gommerman, an immunologist at the University of Toronto. "We can't live forever sheltering vulnerable people and boosting them so that their antibody levels stay artificially high."

Nasal vaccines have been shown to protect mice, ferrets, hamsters and monkeys against the coronavirus. A new study last week offered powerful evidence in support of their use as a booster. [Tianyang Mao, Benjamin Israelow, Alexandra Suberi, et al. Unadjuvanted intranasal spike vaccine booster elicits robust protective mucosal immunity against sarbecoviruses. bioRxiv 2022.01.24.477597; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.01.24.477597]

An intranasal booster induced immune memory cells and antibodies in the nose and throat, and strengthened protection from the initial vaccination, the researchers reported. The study has not yet been published in a scientific journal.

"Our approach is to not use a nasal vaccine as a primary vaccination, but to boost with nasal vaccine, because then you can leverage the existing immunity that's already created," said Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University who led the study.

When she and her colleagues used a mix of proteins from the new coronavirus as well as the related SARS virus, their experimental nasal vaccine seemed capable of fending off a broad range of coronavirus variants.

"There's some flexibility, and there might be more resilience against the virus," said Dr. Gommerman, who was not involved in the work. "And because we don't know what the virus will do next, that's awfully appealing."

The current COVID vaccines are injected into muscle, and excel at training immune cells to tackle the virus after it enters the body. They produce antibodies called IgG that circulate in the blood and can be marshaled when needed.

But few of these antibodies travel to the nose and throat, and even those that do wane quickly.

By contrast, nasal vaccines produce a special set of antibodies, called IgA, that thrive on mucosal surfaces like the nose and throat. And these antibodies may wane more slowly.

A vaccine delivered with a nebulizer could coat the entire airway, including the lungs, with IgA antibodies. "It's not just the tip of the nose that's protected," Dr. Iwasaki said.

Mounting evidence supports IgA antibodies as the key to preventing infection. In one study, Dr. Gommerman and her colleagues found that only about 30% of people had detectable IgA antibodies after receiving a 2nd dose of vaccine.

Those who had lower levels of IgA within a month of the 2nd dose were more likely to develop a breakthrough infection. IgG levels seemed to have no impact on the outcome.

"Location really matters, and mucosal immunity is really important for protection from infection," said Michal Tal, an immunologist at Stanford University who was involved in the work.

People who gain immunity because of an infection with the virus -- rather than from an injected vaccine -- tend to have strong mucosal immunity, at least for a while. That may help explain why they seemed to fare better against the delta variant than those who had been vaccinated, Dr. Tal said.

But she warned that trying to obtain mucosal immunity by getting infected was dangerous. "The way to get people that kind of mucosal protection really, really, really should be with a nasal vaccine," she said.

Trying to enhance the vaccine with an extra ingredient, called an adjuvant, inflamed the nasal mucosa and led to Bell's palsy in some people.

But those problems would not plague a nasal vaccine that uses a viral protein, Dr. Iwasaki said: "Our approach is so different, I don't think it suffers from that kind of limitation."

Still, there has been little talk of nasal vaccines for COVID in the United States, which has embraced the mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.

"A lot of these developments take place in other regions of the world," said Dr. Krammer, who is involved in an effort to create a nasal vaccine. "The appetite for new vaccines in the U.S. is very low."

One reason for the hesitation is that no one yet knows how powerful immunity might be from a mucosal COVID vaccine, and how long it might last, Dr. Gommerman said.

But mRNA vaccines likewise were a gamble at the start of the pandemic, she noted: "I don't think that's a good enough reason to not try."

[... developing nasal vaccines is complicated. Measuring mucosal antibodies is much more difficult than quantifying antibodies in the blood. The amounts are often low and can fluctuate wildly. For example, the aroma of a delicious meal may flood the mouth with saliva, diluting mucosal antibody levels.

"It's just like a stepchild for vaccine development, because it's hard," Florian Krammer, an immunologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, said of mucosal vaccines.

The only nasal vaccine approved in the United States for respiratory diseases is FluMist, and even that has been riddled with problems. FluMist relies on a weakened flu virus, so it works well in children who have never been exposed. But in many adults, existing immunity to flu killed the weakened virus and left the vaccine ineffective (NYT). - Mod.LK]

[2] New conditions following COVID
Date: Fri 4 Feb 2022

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/02/new-conditions-common-1-5-months-after-positive-covid-test


New conditions common 1 to 5 months after positive COVID test
-------------------------------------------------------------
A cohort study of Americans tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection shows that new-onset shortness of breath, heart rhythm abnormalities, and type 2 diabetes were more common 31-150 days after testing positive for COVID-19 than among those with negative results.

The research was published today [4 Feb 2022] in JAMA Network Open.

A team led by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) researchers examined new signs and symptoms among 144 768 nonhospitalized and 23 933 hospitalized people 20 years and older with a positive COVID-19 test, and 1 227 510 nonhospitalized people with a negative test. Among the 338 024 people younger than 20 years, 25 327 nonhospitalized and 1338 hospitalized people tested positive, and 260 660 nonhospitalized and 50 699 hospitalized patients had a negative test result.

The team followed the cohorts for 150 days after they were tested for COVID-19. They used aggregated electronic health record data from 40 healthcare systems on patients tested from March-December 2020. The team considered a new diagnosis as an emerging sign or symptom that was absent in the 18 months to 7 days before testing.

People in the younger age-group who tested positive for COVID-19 were older (ages 13-19) than those with negative results (49% vs 35%). More people aged 20 and or older (18%) and those younger than 20 years (26%) with positive tests were Hispanic in all care settings than those who tested negative (8% and 14%, respectively).

Those with severe COVID-19 prone to new diagnoses
-------------------------------------------------
Of people aged 20 years and older with a positive COVID-19 test, shortness of breath (4.5% nonhospitalized, 10.5% hospitalized, 16.6% ventilated), fatigue (4.2% nonhospitalized, 8.0% hospitalized, 19.8% ventilated), and sleep disorders (3.2% nonhospitalized, 5.6% hospitalized, 10.4% ventilated) were the most common new conditions.

Among the under-20 group with a positive test, change in bowel habits (2.3% nonhospitalized, 6.0% hospitalized), fatigue (1.7% nonhospitalized, 3.5% hospitalized), and shortness of breath (1.8% nonhospitalized, 3.9% hospitalized) were the most common diagnoses.

Hospitalized patients with a positive test result were more likely to report shortness of breath than those who tested negative (20 years and older: prevalence ratio [PR], 1.89; 20 years and older: PR, 1.72). Shortness of breath was also more common among outpatients 20 years or older with a positive COVID-19 test than among those with a negative result (PR, 1.09).

Hospitalized patients aged 20 or older who tested positive for COVID-19 were more likely than those with negative results to report new fatigue (PR, 1.35) and type 2 diabetes (PR, 2.03). Among younger hospitalized patients, type 2 diabetes (PR, 2.14) was more common among those testing positive versus negative, but the difference between them was less than 1%.

The rate of new diagnoses in nonhospitalized people 20 years and older with a positive test result was less than 2%. Among older hospitalized people with a positive result, type 2 diabetes (7.2%), anxiety and depression (4.9%), and uncoordinated movements or trouble walking (2.2%) were the most common new diagnoses.

Among older people ventilated with a positive test, the most common diagnoses were type 2 diabetes (16.7%) and anxiety and depression (9.5%). New peripheral nerve disorders (7.2%), uncoordinated movements or trouble walking (7.3%), and neuromuscular disorders (5.7%) were common among ventilated persons in this group, but these conditions were rare among their nonventilated hospitalized and nonhospitalized peers (2.5% or less).

Increased awareness among clinicians needed
-------------------------------------------
Among the younger age-group with a positive test, anxiety and depression (2.6% nonhospitalized, 4.6% hospitalized) were the most common diagnoses.

Type 2 diabetes and severe obesity were more common in people 20 years or older with a positive result than among those who tested negative in all care settings from 18 months to 7 days before COVID-19 testing. Hospitalized people younger than 20 who tested positive had a higher rate of cancer than those who tested negative (10% vs 6%) during that period.

The authors noted that long COVID symptoms, such as shortness of breath, fatigue, muscle weakness, fatigue, and cognitive dysfunction, as well as diagnoses of new-onset neuropsychiatric illnesses and type 2 diabetes, are well documented. This, however, was the first population-based characterization of these conditions in the United States, they said.

Although new symptoms and conditions after COVID-19 recovery are rare, applying rates of these events to the millions of COVID-19 survivors implies that many might experience new symptoms and conditions after recovery from their initial illness, the researchers said.

"In addition, new symptoms can be long-lasting and involve chronic conditions, such as type 2 diabetes," they wrote. "Increasing awareness of new symptoms and conditions among health care professionals and health systems is paramount to meet the needs of patients with prolonged or chronic sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection."

[3] Spikevax, wastewater and more

ACIP fully recommends Spikevax, as CDC expands wastewater surveillance
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Today [4 Feb 2022] during a meeting of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), the group voted unanimously to fully recommend the use of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in adults 18 and older.

The vaccine, now called Spikevax, gained full Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval earlier this week.

The meeting included new discussion of myocarditis risks in recipients of mRNA vaccines. The CDC's Tom Shimabukuro, MD, MPH, shared that there have been 13 deaths following mRNA vaccination from myocarditis in the United States, but upon investigation, none have been deemed to be caused by vaccination.

Most myocarditis cases following mRNA vaccine were fully resolved within 90 days of diagnosis, with patients saying the condition had no impact on their quality of life, and most cases were classified as mild according to clinicians.

With the full recommendation of Spikevax, the United States now has 2 fully approved COVID-19 vaccines.

The CDC COVID Data Tracker shows 64% of Americans are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, 75.5% have received at least one dose of vaccine, and 41.9% of vaccinated Americans have received a booster dose. [https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total]

Wastewater surveillance to detect changes in virus levels
---------------------------------------------------------
Also today [4 Feb 2022], the CDC announced they were expanding their National Wastewater Surveillance System to include changes in SARS-CoV-2 detections in wastewater. [https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#wastewater-surveillance]

"These data are uniquely powerful because they capture the presence of infections from people with and without symptoms, and they're not affected by access to health care or availability of clinical testing," said program lead Amy Kirby, PhD, MPH, in a press call today. In several US communities, wastewater readings have predicted surges in daily case counts.

Thirty-seven states participate in the surveillance system, Kirby said, but the program is expected to grow significantly in the coming months.

The United States reported 281 518 new COVID-19 cases yesterday [3 Feb 2022], and 2241 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker. [https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/cumulative-cases]

The HHS Protect Public Data Hub shows 120 058 inpatient beds in use for COVID-19. [https://protect-public.hhs.gov/pages/hospital-utilization]

Pediatric vaccination rates dip
-------------------------------
COVID-19 vaccinations among US children ages 5-11 have fallen to their lowest levels since the shots were first approved, Bloomberg reports. Only 31% of kids in this group have initiated a vaccination series, compared to 75% of American adults. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-03/kids-vaccinations-plummet-as-u-s-considers-shots-for-youngest]

For the first time since the vaccines were approved in November [2021], the number of children getting their 1st dose hovered around 37 000.

Children ages 6 month-4 years are expected to become eligible for vaccination by the end of the month [February 2022], but previous studies have shown the 2-dose Pfizer vaccine series offers insufficient protection in this age group.

New data shows respirators lower risk of COVID-19 infection by 83%
------------------------------------------------------------------
New data published in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report support the use of well-fitted face masks or respirators in indoor settings to protect against new COVID-19 infections.

Researchers said respirators, such as N95s, offered the most protection, limiting infection rates by 83%. Surgical masks lowered rates by 66%, and cloth masks by 56%. The study was based on randomly selected California residents who had received a test result for SARS-CoV-2 from [18 Feb-1 Dec 2021]. Patients were interviewed about mask use.

"These data from real-world settings reinforce the importance of consistently wearing face masks or respirators to reduce the risk of acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 infection among the general public in indoor community settings," the authors said.

[4] mRNA vaccine: Made in Africa
Date: Thu 3 Feb 2022
Source: Reuters [edited]
https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/world-first-safricas-afrigen-makes-mrna-covid-vaccine-using-moderna-data-2022-02-03/

South Africa's Afrigen Biologics has used the publicly available sequence of Moderna Inc's mRNA COVID-19 vaccine to make its own version of the shot, which could be tested in humans before the end of this year [2022], Afrigen's top executive said on Thursday [3 Feb 2022].

The vaccine candidate would be the first to be made based on a widely used vaccine without the assistance and approval of the developer. It is also the 1st mRNA vaccine designed, developed and produced at lab scale on the African continent.

The World Health Organization (WHO) last year [2021] picked a consortium including Afrigen for a pilot project to give poor and middle-income countries the know-how to make COVID vaccines, after market leaders of the mRNA COVID vaccine, Pfizer, BioNTech, and Moderna, declined a WHO request to share their technology and expertise.

The WHO and consortium partners hope their technology transfer hub will help overcome inequalities between rich nations and poorer countries in getting access to vaccines. Some 99% of Africa's vaccines against all diseases are imported and the negligible remainder manufactured locally.

During the pandemic, wealthy countries have hoovered up most of the world's supplies of vaccines.

Biovac, a partly state-owned South African vaccine producer, will be the 1st recipient of the technology from the hub. Afrigen has also agreed to help train companies in Argentina and Brazil.

In September [2021], the WHO's hub in Cape Town decided to go it alone after failing to bring on board Pfizer and Moderna, both of which have argued they need to oversee any technology transfer due to the complexity of the manufacturing process.

Moderna had no immediate comment on Afrigen's announcement on Thursday [3 Feb 2022].

Moderna's vaccine was chosen by the WHO due to an abundance of public information and the company's pledge not to enforce patents during the pandemic. It's not clear what will happen after the pandemic ends and whether the company will try to enforce them again.

"If this project shows that Africa can take cutting edge technology and produce cutting-edge products, this will banish this idea that Africa can't do it and change the global mindset ... this can be a game-changer," Charles Gore, executive director at MPP, told Reuters at Afrigen's facility, a converted warehouse.

Under pressure to make drugs in lower-income countries, Moderna and BioNTech have announced plans to build mRNA vaccine factories in Africa, but production is still a long way off.

"We haven't copied Moderna, we've developed our own processes because Moderna didn't give us any technology," Petro Terblanche, managing director at Afrigen, told Reuters.

"We started with the Moderna sequence because that gives, in our view, the best starting material. But this is not Moderna's vaccine, it is the Afrigen mRNA hub vaccine," Terblanche said.

She later took a delegation of EU diplomats on a tour of the state-of-the-art facility where scientists were seen making mRNA in sterile white-walled rooms.

She said it had managed to make, in collaboration with Johannesburg's University of the Witwatersrand, its first micro-litre laboratory scale batches of COVID mRNA vaccines at the Cape Town facility.

Terblanche said Afrigen was also working on a next generation mRNA vaccine that didn't need freezing temperatures for storage, required for the Pfizer and Moderna doses, and which would be better suited to Africa, which is often dealing with high temperatures and poor health facilities and infrastructure.

"We will only make our clinical trial batch probably in 6 months from now, (meaning) ... fit for humans. And the target is November 2022," Terblanche added.

Online training for other companies to make the shot started with manufacturers in Brazil and Argentina last year [2021]. Afrigen expects to get more on board within the next month [March 2022].

[The COVID-19 vaccine coverage in Africa is the lowest 2 years into the pandemic and over one year after a global rollout and supply of the wide array of vaccines. While 124 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine have been administered per 100 people in the world, the vaccination rate in Africa is almost 25 doses per 100 individuals. Besides being far slower than the global average, the vaccination is marked by a striking divide between African countries. While Seychelles inoculated 185.5 doses per 100 people, the rate in Burundi was at 0.07 vaccines per 100 individuals (https://www.statista.com/statistics/1220391/covid-19-vaccination-doses-in-africa-by-country/).

Africa started receiving vaccine supplies under the WHO-backed Covax facility in February 2021. Moreover, some African countries purchased additional doses, while others benefited from bilateral donations. Based on the data from the Africa CDC webpage (https://africacdc.org/covid-19-vaccination/) as of 2 Feb 2022;

Vaccine Administered (Total) (63.61% of supply)
379.7 million doses out of 596.9 million supplied doses
Partially Vaccinated (16.37% of population)
Vaccination Completed (11.30% of population)
Booster Dose (0.67% of population)

In June 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) and its COVAX partners began work with a South African consortium comprising Biovac, Afrigen Biologics and Vaccines, a network of universities and the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to establish its first COVID mRNA vaccine technology transfer hub. (https://www.who.int/news/item/21-06-2021-who-supporting-south-african-consortium-to-establish-first-covid-mrna-vaccine-technology-transfer-hub)

Technology transfer hubs are training facilities where the technology is established at industrial scale and clinical development performed. Interested manufacturers from low- and middle-income countries can receive training and any necessary licenses to the technology. WHO and partners will bring in the production know-how, quality control and necessary licenses to a single entity to facilitate a broad and rapid technology transfer to multiple recipients.

When the WHO launched its mRNA tech-transfer hub in South Africa last June [2021], it asked Moderna, Pfizer and BioNTech to help teach researchers in low- and middle-income countries how to make their COVID-19 vaccines. But the companies did not respond, and the WHO decided to go ahead without their help. Friede says the WHO chose to replicate Moderna's shot because more information on its development is available publicly, compared with Pfizer-BioNTech's vaccine, and because Moderna has vowed not to enforce its patents during the pandemic (https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00293-2)

This indigenous source of COVID-19 vaccine production is a huge step towards countering the vaccine inequity that has seriously impacted coverage in Africa. Moreover, the capacity developed through technology transfer is the first step towards preparedness for future infectious disease threats and pandemics. - Mod.UBA]

A 7-day series of cumulative data reported by countries, territories, and reporting entities can be found at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/2022%20FEB4WORLD7_1644121499.pdf.

In the past 24 hours, 45 countries: USA (346 448), France (241 049), Germany (235 511), Brazil (219 298), Russia (168 201), India (130 163), Turkey (111 157), Italy (100 900), Japan (94 431), the UK (82 053), the Netherlands (68 916), Spain (74 937), Israel (62 302), Poland (47 536), Portugal (47 199), Czech Republic (37 797), Argentina (40 094), Denmark (37 938), Mexico (37 063), Ukraine (43 778), Austria (36 329), Chile (38 707), Iran (36 908), South Korea (36 362), Switzerland (33 268), Indonesia (32 211), Romania (31 776), Sweden (28 129), Australia (26 342), Georgia (22 263), Jordan (21 386), Norway (20 856), Slovakia (19 889), Greece (18 640), Hungary (16 435), Canada (16 315), Colombia (13 390), Singapore (13 208), Lithuania (12 961), Slovenia (11 744), Vietnam (11 594), Panama (11 291), Thailand (10 490), Uruguay (10 363), and Latvia (10 137) reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 12 573 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 2 Feb 2022 to late 3 Feb 2022). The exponential rise in cases over the last few weeks can be attributed to the rapid spread of the omicron variant globally. The 7-day averages indicate an increasing global trend for cases and deaths.

A total of 90 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 48 of the 90 countries are from the European region, 13 are from the Americas region, 14 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, 5 from the South East Asia region, and 4 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 10.1%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 17.7%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 4.7% increase in daily reported cases and a 42.5% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 2.97 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 391.49 million cumulative reported cases and over 5.74 million reported deaths. Transmission continues at a very high level. - Mod.UBA]
