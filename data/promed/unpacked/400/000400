The current N.W.T. bison anthrax outbreak is the largest ever in the territory.

Tony Vermillion, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources' manager of wildlife and environment for the South Slave region, said he doesn't think the latest bison carcasses are from a new outbreak; they're simply deaths they didn't find in earlier searches. "The way it worked out is we found such a large number right off the bat," he said. "We had to start dealing with those and did more reconnaissance flights and flew more in the area with rotary helicopters coming up on more carcasses and dealing with those as we went along."

Last week, the number of deaths was estimated at 340, making this the largest ever anthrax outbreak among bison in the territory. The largest [cluster] of dead bison was initially found at Mills Lake near Fort Providence, where there were more than 150. Now, more than 100 are being incinerated between Mink Lake and the Horn plateau. Bison carcasses have also been found along the western shore of Great Slave Lake and up Highway 3 to Frank's Channel.

In 2000, the N.W.T. estimated the number of bison in the Mackenzie population at about 2000.

[In the 1993 epidemic, some 10 percent of the wood bison in the MacKenzie Bison Sanctuary were found dead and disposed of. This time, we are now at over 20 percent dead if the 2000 population estimate is correct. I suspect we will soon see that this epidemic has peaked out. I say this because during the March 1994 serum sampling, some 90 percent of the sampled bison were found to have high antibody titres, i.e. herd immunity had kicked in. I think we can assume the same will occur this summer (2012).

The only time I have seen a higher mortality was during the 2001 epidemic on the Edwards Plateau in west Texas when some 80 percent of the native and exotic ranched deer were killed. But this was an abnormal situation of very high density thanks to the Texans' habit of feeding their deer at frequently placed feeding stations, which supported a population some 10 times higher than normal or natural.

Why some 20 percent have died this year [2012] must await clarification once the smoke clears. The simplest explanation is that the MBS was carrying significantly more bison than the 2000 estimate. - Mod.MHJ
