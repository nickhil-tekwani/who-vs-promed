An Outbreak of a Leaf Spot Disease of Cabbage in Southern Florida Caused by
_Xanthomonas campestris_ pv. _armoraciae_.

University of Florida, Department of Plant Pathology, 1453 Fifield Hall,
Gainesville 32611. Florida Agric. Exp. Sta. Journal Series R-09462; Plant
Dis. 87:873, 2003; published on-line as D-2003-0501-02N, 2003. Accepted for
publication 16 Apr 2003.
From October to December 2001, a leaf spot disease was observed in
numerous commercial fields of red and green cabbage (_Brassica oleracea_
var. _capitata_ L.) in the Everglades Agricultural Area, south and east of
Lake Okeechobee and in the environs of Immokalee in southwestern Florida.
Discrete water-soaked to greasy-appearing spots were observed in the leaf
blades with no evidence of marginal V-shaped lesions characteristic of
black rot caused by _Xanthomonas campestris_ pv. _campestris_.
Profuse bacterial streaming was observed when cut leaf sections were
examined microscopically. A bacterium that formed yellow colonies on
nutrient agar was consistently isolated from these lesions. 10 bacteria
were isolated, purified, and characterized. All strains were aerobic,
Gram-negative rods. Strains were positive for esculin hydrolysis,
proteolysis in litmus milk, and gelatin liquefaction. Strains were negative
for urease production, nitrate reduction, oxidase, and utilization of
asparagine as a sole source of carbon and nitrogen.
Fatty acid methyl ester analysis indicated a match with Florida library
strains of _X. campestris_ pv. _raphani_ (similarity indices 0.605-0.738).
Suspensions (20 million CFU/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) of 2 Oklahoma
strains identified as _X. campestris_ pv. _armoraciae_ provided by J. P.
Damicone (3) and 4 representative Florida strains were applied to plants
using a hand-held sprayer.
Pathogenicity of the strains was tested on 3 replicate greenhouse-grown
plants of the following: green cabbage cv. Market Early; red cabbage cv.
Salad Delight; radish cv. Red Silk; tomato cv. Sunny; sweet bell pepper cv.
Jupiter; and fresh horseradish roots purchased from a retail grocery chain.
A strain of _X. campestris_ pv. _campestris_ originally isolated from
Homestead, FL was also included in pathogenicity tests. All Florida and
Oklahoma strains produced leaf spots, but no V-shaped lesions, on leaves of
green cabbage, red cabbage, radish, tomato, and horseradish.
Typical black rot symptoms were observed only in radish and green and red
cabbage inoculated with the _X. campestris_ pv. _campestris_ strain. On the
basis of these results, we identify the Florida strains as _X. campestris_
pv. _armoraciae_ (1,2,3), recognizing the precedent of _X. campestris_ pv.
_armoraciae_ over _X. campestris_ pv. _raphani_ based on extensive genetic
and serological data (1).
Our strains appear to be more similar to those causing outbreaks on
crucifers in Oklahoma (3) than those in Ohio (2), because Florida strains
were pathogenic on tomato.

[_Xanthomonas campestris_ pv. _armoraciae_ [Xpa] is also present in
Australia, Japan, Brazil, China, Turkey, and India. The disease is favored
by cool temperatures in fall and winter, although it infects susceptible
hosts over a wide temperature range. Infected plant debris is a source of
inoculum and Xpa is known to be soil- and seed-borne. Disease management
involves use of bacteria-free seed, planting in well drained soils, and
rotation of non-cruciferous crops on a 3-year cycle. Apparently there are
no tolerant or resistant cultivars.
