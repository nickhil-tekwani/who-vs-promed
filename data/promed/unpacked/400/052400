[Since 15 Jan 2020 and up to date [13 Feb 2020], 5 outbreaks among sheep and goat in Al Kufrah had been officially reported to the OIE by the Libyan competent authority in animal health. The 5th outbreak (mentioned above) was registered in a slaughterhouse. Rift Valley fever virus [RVFV] is a zoonotic arbovirus that causes considerable human and animal morbidity and mortality. In this context, special attention must be paid to the slaughterhouse worker. Also, as mentioned in the report above, laboratory results are pending. - Mod.SF]

[According to the report, the animals were diagnosed in a slaughterhouse. Since 2 "species" are included, one being "sheep/goats," the other one "sheep," it may be assumed that those were 2 consignments arriving at the slaughterhouse, one composed of both sheep and goats (a mixed flock) and the other one of sheep only. It will be helpful to note if clinical signs have led to the diagnosis on top of the serologic tests (IgM-capture ELISA) applied at the laboratory. Since 4 deaths were reported, samples for PCR could have been helpful for confirmation of active RVF.

RVFV activity in countries bordering the southern part of Libya [Chad and Sudan] supports the hypothesis of a continuous risk of introduction of RVFV through animals imported from endemic neighbor countries." [1]. The live camel export of Sudan is, according to a 2018 paper, gradually increasing, with most going on the hoof to Egypt and Libya [2].
