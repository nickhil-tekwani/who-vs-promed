In answer to your question, I pose this one: Do newborns have SV40
sequences? Are we born with the sequences? If so, we need evolutionary
biologists in on this one. If not, perhaps they are latent, but for what
reason?

[Regarding SV40 virus's role in tumor development, it is known that these
viruses have a large T antigen which binds with the protein product of a
tumor suppressor gene p53 and prevents the binding of p53 protein to its
sequence specific DNA.
This inactivation of p53 is likely to cause tumors as the cell cylce
control system is
lost and the G1-S phase arrest seen with DNA damage in normal cells fails
to occur
in such virus transformed cells. Ohter oncogenic viruses like Epstein Barr
virus,
human papilloma virus are also known to inactivate the p53 gene in a
similar fashion.
