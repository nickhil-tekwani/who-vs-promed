New Zealand has seen an increase in syphilis notifications in recent years. Following a local outbreak in 2010 cases locally have been sporadic but there has been a spike in notifications in the MidCentral region over the last few weeks with evidence of local transmission.

Dr Anne Robertson, medical head, Sexual Health Service says: "As recent evidence from the local measles outbreak has demonstrated, case finding and tracking of contacts brings an epidemic under control. Unlike measles details of cases will not be reported because of the stigma associated with sexually transmitted infections (STIs)."

Syphilis is a bacterial infection and is sexually transmitted by direct transmission with infectious lesions or for babies vertically though the placenta.

In 2014, 95.7 per cent of cases notified in New Zealand were male, the majority of whom have male sexual contacts. Female cases are currently uncommon but if pregnant women acquire infection after the time they have their booking bloods there is a risk of neonatal infection.

[The reports above say that an outbreak of syphilis is occurring in Manawatu in the Midcentral region of the North Island of New Zealand, but they are short of further details.

The MidCentral District Health Board provides health services to a geographic region that spans across the North Island of New Zealand from the west to the east coasts in 3 districts (http://www.regentpersonnel.co.uk/new-zealand-jobs/midcentral-guide/). The Manawatu District is a local government district, with a population of 29 300, in the Manawatu-Wanganui Region on the west coast of the North Island; the main town is Feilding, which has a population of 15 950 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manawatu_District). The Manawatu District may also include the city of Palmerston North, which has a population of 85 500 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmerston_North).

More epidemiological information that characterizes this syphilis outbreak in Manawatu would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
