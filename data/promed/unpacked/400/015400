Update 71 - Status of diagnostic tests, training course in China 2 Jun 2003
Status of diagnostic tests
The development of commercial diagnostic tests for SARS has
progressed more slowly than initially hoped. Part of the problem
arises from certain unusual features of SARS that make this disease
an especially difficult scientific challenge.
For many viral diseases, the greatest quantities of the causative
agent are excreted during the initial phase of illness, usually in
the first few days following the onset of symptoms. This is often the
period during which patients pose the greatest risk of infecting
others.
SARS, however, follows a different pattern. During the initial phase
of illness, virus shedding is comparatively low. Virus shedding peaks
in respiratory specimens and in stools at around 10 days after onset
of clinical illness. In effect, this unusual behaviour creates the
need for tests with a particularly high sensitivity.
Such tests do not yet exist. Because small quantities of the virus
are initially shed, available tests, though developed with impressive
speed, are unable to detect SARS virus or its genetic material
reliably during the earliest days of illness. The low sensitivity of
current virus detection tests is a particular challenge for SARS
control, as patients are capable of infecting others during the
initial phase and therefore need to be reliably detected and quickly
isolated.
In SARS patients, detectable immune responses do not begin until day
5 or 6. Reliable antibody tests can detect virus only by around day
10 following the onset of symptoms.
WHO continues to recommend use of its case definitions, based on
clinical presentation, distinct chest X-rays, and history of possible
contact with SARS patients, to detect suspect and probable cases and
make management decisions.
To expedite the development of better diagnostic tests, laboratories
in the WHO collaborating network have made critical biological
materials and reagents available to any laboratory having a sustained
interest in the development of diagnostic tests, including the
commercial sector. A comprehensive bank of clinical specimens,
including respiratory specimens and samples of blood, urine, and
faeces from SARS patients, has been established. The bank holds
specimens representing all stages of the disease, ranging from the
onset of symptoms to recovery.
During the development of diagnostic tests, such specimens are needed
to assess how well a test will perform with real patients' specimens,
as opposed to under the artificial conditions of a laboratory.
Specimens from the bank, which was set up by the Hong Kong Department
of Health and the Hospital Authority, are being supplied by a
collaborating laboratory, at no charge, to developers of diagnostic
tests. As a sample from a single specimen can be subdivided into 6 to
8 identical sub-samples, laboratories can work in parallel on
identical specimens, which will further facilitate the assessment of
comparative performance. Identical samples also support
standardization of diagnostic tests to ensure consistent accuracy.
Laboratories in the WHO network have also made available
standardizing reagents for virus and antibody tests. These reagents,
which include samples of the inactivated virus and blood from
patients in both acute and convalescent stages of illness, will allow
uniform assessment of diagnostic results around the world against a
"gold standard."
Sera have been made available by collaborating laboratories in the
United Kingdom and Hong Kong. Inactivated virus was prepared by the
Bernard-Nocht Institute in Germany. Distribution of these reagents
will be the responsibility of the Robert-Koch Institute, also in
Germany. In return for the supply of these exclusive materials,
recipients of WHO support have agreed to offer test kits, once
available, at preferential prices to developing countries.
Training course in China
WHO is currently coordinating a series of training courses in Beijing
aimed at establishing an efficient laboratory infrastructure for SARS
diagnosis in all provinces throughout China. Work of the WHO
laboratory network has made it possible to support the training
courses with test materials and reagents.
Training in the use of currently available tests is being provided by
representatives of the labs where they were developed, thus ensuring
that Chinese professionals benefit from the best first-hand
experience the world can offer. Trainers come from laboratories in
the USA, the UK, and Hong Kong.
China has already developed a highly promising ELISA diagnostic test.
For early detection of SARS virus, the PCR molecular test offers the
greatest potential under average hospital conditions. The Singapore
Genomic Institute has made its PCR test available, at no cost, to
support SARS diagnosis in China.

Coronavirus Antibody Testing at State Public Health Laboratories 30 May 2003
CDC has made reagents for SARS coronavirus antibody testing available
to state public health laboratories. To meet U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) regulations for use of non-licensed tests in
laboratories outside of CDC, the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of
CDC has approved the following consenting documents and additional
informational material for use in conjunction with the collection and
testing of specimens in state public health laboratories. Clinicians
are encouraged to obtain, if possible, informed consent prior to
collecting such specimens, and to contact their state public health
laboratories for additional information on submitting specimens.
These documents and additional information also are available on the
website of the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL).

Race to Develop New Generation of SARS Diagnostic Tests
-------------------------------------------------------
A number of experimental tests have been developed or are being
developed, scientists, government officials, and corporate executives
said in recent interviews and at a meeting on SARS research at the
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda on
Fri 30 May 2003. But such development "has progressed more slowly
than initially hoped" because people produce only small amounts of
the SARS virus in the first few days of illness, unlike most other
viral diseases, the World Health Organization said yesterday. This
unusual feature of SARS will require highly sensitive tests, and it
will probably be several months before doctors will be able to use a
single test to determine whether a person must be isolated because he
or she has SARS.
Before a test can be relied upon, it must be run on specimens known
to contain the virus to make sure it is accurate. And it has been
difficult, scientists said, to procure enough specimens from patients
at different stages of the disease to do this. An accurate test is
vital for public health because the consequences of a wrong diagnosis
can be severe. If SARS is missed, the disease can spread. And a false
diagnosis can mean unnecessary isolation, quarantines, and economic
havoc.
A diagnosis of probable SARS is now based on a checklist of symptoms,
chest X-rays, and information about whether a person has been exposed
to someone with the disease or has traveled to a region where SARS is
widespread. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has
developed a test that detects antibodies to the SARS virus in blood.
But it usually takes 21 days for a person to make enough antibodies
to be detected. So the usefulness of such tests is generally limited
to epidemiological studies. Most efforts to develop quicker tests
rely on a technique called PCR (polymerase chain reaction). This
technique can detect tiny amounts of a virus's genetic material.
Scientists have to initiate the test [by adding oligonucleotide
primers to anneal specifically to the target genome]. The CDC has
developed a PCR test, and a number of companies have developed their
own [versions].
One of the first was developed by Artus in Germany, which is already
providing its test to labs around the world. Abbott Laboratories, one
of the largest companies in diagnostic testing, [is licensed] to sell
the Artus test in the United States, Canada, and other countries.
Roche, another leader in diagnostics, said it hoped to have a test
developed in a few weeks. Others developing tests include EraGen
BioSciences of Madison, Wisconsin, and Prodesse of Waukesha,
Wisconsin. Polymerase tests can theoretically produce results in 2 to
6 hours, though in actual practice results may not be ready for a day
or 2, especially if the samples have to be sent somewhere for testing.
Dr. Heymann of the WHO said some of the early SARS tests produced
"many false negatives," meaning that they [did not detect] the virus
[when it was present]. The CDC says PCR tests also tend to produce
false positives, so that any positive finding should be confirmed by
repeating the test or having the specimen tested by another
laboratory.
One of the biggest problems now is that scientists do not yet know
how and when to take samples to have the best chance of finding the
virus. It can be found at different times in nasal and lung fluids,
stool, and blood. Less SARS virus seem to be present in the first 5
days of illness than later, presenting a major challenge in
developing diagnostic tests, said Dr. Malik Peiris of the University
of Hong Kong.
Patients for testing have been hard to come by. That is a common
quandary for companies, said Dr. Peter Heseltine, medical director
for infectious diseases at Quest Diagnostics, the nation's largest
clinical laboratory company, which is developing its own SARS test.
Part of the problem, especially for American companies, is that most
SARS cases are in Asia. Doctors there are often too busy coping with
the immediate crisis to send samples to researchers developing tests.
Also some package delivery services had refused to carry SARS
specimens. The authorities say, however, that there has been no known
case of SARS infection from shipment of samples.
Tommy G. Thompson, US Secretary of Health and Human Services, and
senior officials of the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration met
with 9 diagnostic companies in Washington on Thursday. The officials
urged the companies to develop SARS tests and promised to work with
the companies. "We are trying to work with the Chinese government to
improve our access to samples from patients in China," Dr. Mark B.
McClellan, the commissioner of the FDA, said in an interview. Dr.
Klaus Stoehr, who directs the WHO's scientific investigation of SARS,
said his agency had developed a specimen bank in Hong Kong that
scientists could tap at no charge. "We ask in return that if
companies develop a licensed test they donate or sell it at a low
price" to poor countries, Dr. Stoehr said.
So far no company has applied for approval of a SARS diagnostic test.
Tests that are offered as a service by clinical laboratories or used
for research do not require FDA approval, so some test developers are
distributing tests without approval. But if a test is to be widely
sold and used to guide treatment, the FDA expects the developers to
seek approval, agency officials said. Several scientists said that
because of the severe consequences of a missed diagnosis, a SARS test
should have rates of false negatives and false positives of less than
5 percent, and preferably much smaller. Some first-generation tests
can detect the SARS virus but not the amount present.
Such quantitative information could be useful in determining who
might spread the virus or in monitoring a treatment. The tests also
are not likely to provide results fast enough to be used, for
example, for airport screening. Participants at Friday's meeting in
Bethesda urged development of a type of test that looks for viral
proteins that might be able to [meet such needs].
