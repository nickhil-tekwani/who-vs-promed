Dear Colleagues,

Two publications within the past 6 weeks respond to the inexorable progression of antimicrobial resistance. Both will contribute to bringing this problem front of mind and, I hope, catalyzing concerted global action. They have underscored for me the importance of education, community, and communication.

In late April 2014, WHO published its 1st look at antimicrobial resistance as a global issue (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2014/amr-report/en/). In this report, WHO deems resistance not as a serious threat predicted for the future, but as something that is happening now, in every country with the potential to affect everyone regardless of age or socio-economic status.

Soon after, a call to arms was published in the form of a commentary in the journal Nature (http://www.nature.com/news/policy-an-intergovernmental-panel-on-antimicrobial-resistance-1.15275). Written by our colleagues Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, and Mark Woolhouse of Edinburgh University's Centre for Immunity, Infection and Evolution, the article calls for the creation of an international body that would partner with governments and agencies that would implement its recommendations. Modeled on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the proposed "Intergovernmental Panel on Antimicrobial Resistance" would call on the knowledge and experience of a broad range of experts including specialists in clinical and veterinary medicine, epidemiologists, microbiologists, pharmacologists, health economists, and international lawyers.

I don't need to list for ProMED members all the microorganisms that have developed resistance to our pharmacological armory; ProMED has reported on the issue of resistance in depth. In the past year alone, ProMED has published 186 posts related to the topic. True to our mission of covering the entire One Health spectrum of human, animal, and crop plant diseases, these articles have followed antimicrobial resistance from _Acinetobacter_ spp. in humans to _Septoria tritici_ blotch in wheat to vancomycin-resistant enterococci in crows. These are just a few instances among thousands each year in which ProMED serves a vital role by providing a worldwide community of infectious disease practitioners with news, information, and analysis that can help readers prevent infections, illness, and fatalities. ProMED keeps you well informed on topics you need and want to know about. No other source covers the topic of infectious diseases so broadly, deeply, and internationally. No other source provides it free of charge.

But why is ProMED free? The International Society for Infectious Disease (ISID) and our donors support the service and makes it available without cost to ensure that news and information about emerging infectious diseases is disseminated as widely as possible. While many of the clinicians, scientists, and public health practitioners who use ProMED could afford to subscribe to this information resource, many could not. ISID is committed to making sure that everyone who needs ProMED can receive it without restriction. ProMED is published every day and every day a global network of infectious disease experts vets the news and information and provides insightful analysis and commentary. Providing this level and quality of service is expensive, however. Fully a third of ProMED-mail's annual budget must be covered through the generosity of its readers. If you are among those who are able to afford to support ProMED, please help keep ProMED unbiased, unfettered, and free. If you believe that communication and community among the world's infectious disease experts is important, please consider a donation to ProMED (http://www.isid.org/donate/netathon2014S.shtml).

Of particular note is increasing antibiotic resistance in South Asia, home to a quarter of the world's population. The WHO report specifically mentions high levels of Enterobacteriaceae resistance to 3rd generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones and high levels of _Staphylococcus aureus_ infections resistant to methicillin. The challenge of antibiotic resistant pathogens in South Asia is extensive, including multidrug resistant _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_, _Salmonella typhi_, _Campylobacter_, and _Vibrio cholerae_, carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, and drug-resistant malaria parasites. ProMED is working hard to address the threat in this region through a new ProMED network designed to foster mutual education, communication, and cooperation among infectious disease professionals throughout the region -- and the world. But we can only succeed with your help. Won't you please join us? Please donate at http://www.isid.org/donate/netathon2014S.shtml.

To those who have already given, thank you! To those who "keep meaning to give" -- please stop procrastinating! To those who assume it will take too long, I promise an online donation will take you less than 6 minutes. Finally, to those who think they can't afford it, please think again. Everybody's contribution is important -- please help!
