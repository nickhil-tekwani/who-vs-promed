Officials said Sunday (21 Feb 2021) 4 people have died from the hemorrhagic Ebola virus during a new outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, warning that people are resisting measures to contain the highly contagious disease.

Since the epidemic's resurgence this month [February 2021], "we have already registered 6 Ebola cases. We have lost 4 infected people," [Eugene Nzanzu Salita], the provincial health minister in North Kivu province in the DRC's east, told AFP.

Salita said one person died Friday [19 Feb 2021] and another on Saturday [20 Feb 2021], while the 2 others died in early February. 2 patients are receiving care at an Ebola treatment centre in Katwa near the major city of Butembo, he added.

Salita complained that the region's residents were not taking the new outbreak seriously enough. "Some families categorically refuse to have their homes disinfected or to hold dignified and safe funerals," the doctor said.

"People have not yet understood that Ebola has reappeared. Everything is not yet clear for them."

A vaccination drive was launched last Monday [15 Feb 2021], but as with past outbreaks, people in the region doubt the existence of Ebola and reject measures aimed at checking its spread, including not to touch sick people and not to wash the dead.

The 10th epidemic, which was declared on 1 Aug 2018, was finally eradicated on 25 Jun 2020, after being exacerbated by ongoing armed conflicts and resistance to anti-Ebola measures.

With more than 2200 deaths recorded, it is considered the most serious in the history of Ebola in the DRC since the scourge first appeared in 1976, named after a river in the former Belgian colony, which was known as Zaire at the time.

An 11th outbreak of the virus, which is believed to reside in bats, was declared over in November [2020] after claiming 55 lives in the northwestern province of Equateur.

Ebola causes severe fever and, in the worst cases, unstoppable bleeding. It is transmitted through close contact with bodily fluids, and people who live with or care for patients are most at risk.

Funeral practices often include washing, touching, and kissing bodies that are still capable of transmitting Ebola, and may have particularly high levels of the live virus in excretions.

The virus has also resurfaced in Guinea, where it has already killed 5 people in the 1st outbreak in West Africa since a 2013-16 epidemic that left more than 11 300 people dead in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.

The United States last week said it would work with the affected governments and the World Health Organization over the outbreaks.

"The world cannot afford to turn the other way. We must do everything in our power to respond quickly, effectively," White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement.

[The response seems to be strong from a number of different organizations including WHO, IOM, MSF, REDHO [Reseau Estudiantin Pour Les Droits De L'Homme/Student Network for Human Rights]. Vaccination began in North Kivu one week ago, and will begin in Guinea once the vaccine arrives this week. Unfortunately it has been delayed by fog for one day. But the responsibility to control the outbreak also falls on the community to follow practices that are now well established such as safe burials, hand washing, and protection against contact with potentially infected bodily fluids. If the people do not take Ebola seriously, it will surely spread again. - Mod.LK]

- Sun 21 Feb 2021. North Kivu: Ebola in Butembo, 2 deaths
[Radio Okapi, in French, machine trans., edited]
https://www.radiookapi.net/2021/02/21/actualite/sante/ebola-butembo-deux-malades-decedes

The provincial minister of Health, [Dr Eugene Nzanzu Salita], indicated 2 patients from the Ebola virus epidemic died on Fri 19 Feb 2021 and Sat 20 Feb 2021 in the province of North Kivu. They were a woman from the Katwa health zone in Butembo and a man from the Biena health zone in Lubero territory who tested positive on Thursday [18 Feb 2021] in Butembo. According to Salita, the deceased man was a contact with the very first Ebola case of the 12th epidemic. This brings the total to 6 cases of Ebola already recorded, including 4 deaths.

"We have just recorded 2 deaths. One last night, another we just recorded this morning. There is an old and a new one; there is the last case of Biena, so the 6th case died, and the 3rd case also died. Out of the 6 (Ebola patients), we have just lost 4, and 2 are at the CTE (Ebola Treatment Center) in Katwa" , detailed Dr Salita.

Dr Salita thus asks all contacts of these Ebola cases to go to health centers as quickly as possible in order to find out their state of health. "We call on families not to make these deaths just another opportunity for contamination because we know that when an Ebola patient dies, the number of viruses is quite high at that time. So if you touch the body, you risk infecting yourself and infecting many people," the provincial minister warned.

He insists that the population not go into hiding with this disease. "You have to get to care as quickly as possible, if you are in contact with a patient, contact our health structures to find out your state of health because, as soon as you have started the signs, you have about 10 days, " advised Dr Salita.

Awareness sessions
------------------
To limit the spread of the virus in Ebola, the provincial minister of health of North Kivu is increasing awareness sessions. On Saturday [20 Feb 2021], he met with pressure groups and citizen movements at City Hall. He called on everyone to get involved in raising public awareness for community engagement against this disease and against COVID-19.

Transmitting real information and avoiding rumors around Ebola in order to avoid the errors known during the 10th Ebola epidemic, this is the key message from the provincial minister of health of North Kivu to his interlocutors.

"We expect citizen movements and pressure groups to convey real information to their members or activists and to the population because we know that among them there are those who distort or convey the wrong information. This confuses the population and leads them to not to adhere to the control measures that are already decreed by the national authorities in connection with COVID-19 and Ebola in this region," said Dr Nzanzu.

While committing to get involved in raising awareness against Ebola, representatives of pressure groups and citizen movements in turn pleaded for fluid communication from the teams involved in the response.

The day before, the provincial minister of health spoke with the drivers of the motorcycle taxis in order to solicit their community involvement.

The cases were found in Katwa and in Manguredjipa, which is about 150 km [93 mi] west of the city of Butembo, where all the previous cases have been clustered.

The concern about uncontrolled spread comes from the distance from Butembo to Manguredjipa which indicates the virus has spread outside the cluster where previous cases were identified. - Mod.LK]

- Fri 19 Feb 2021. North Kivu: no checks at Butembo entry and exit points, denounces REDHO NGO
[Radio Okapi, in French, machine trans., edited)]
https://www.radiookapi.net/2021/02/19/actualite/sante/ebola-au-nord-kivu-pas-de-controle-aux-points-dentree-et-sortie-de

The Human Rights Network (REDHO) [Reseau Estudiantin Pour Les Droits De L'Homme/Student Network for Human Rights] deplores the lack of control mechanisms in the fight against the Ebola epidemic at the entry and exit points of Butembo in North Kivu. In a statement made Fri 19 Feb 2021 to Radio Okapi, this organization fears a conflagration of the situation, if arrangements are not taken in time to prevent the spread.

"We had to visit the entry point of Butembo-Beni in Kangote, nothing is done, we went to see the entry point of Lyambogho road Lubero, nothing is done. We went to check on Kyondo road, Vuhovi road, Butuhe road, Vuhinga road, and others, so far nothing has been done, "laments REDHO coordinator, Mr Muhindo Wasivinywa.

Another 2 cases of Ebola were notified in the Butembo-Lubero region in North Kivu on Thu 18 Feb 2021. According to the provincial Minister of Health of North Kivu, Dr Eugene Nzanzu Salita, one is located in the Katwa health zone, in the town of Butembo, and the other in Manguredjipa in the health zone of Biena, in Lubero territory [see above].

Mr Wasivinywa invites health experts to take precautions so that the disease cannot leave the 3 health zones already affected.

"Our fear is that the disease could spread throughout the area, especially the greater North Kivu with 17 health zones of the Butembo DPS [Provincial Health Division]. If health experts could try to take precautions so that the disease cannot leave the 3 health zones already affected that would be a good thing, " he advised.

The REDOC [provincial director] calls on the country's authorities and all government partners to use the experience of the 10th epidemic to quickly stop this 12th Ebola epidemic in the region.

"With the experience of the 10th epidemic, we could do the screening; if the see temperature of passers-by exceeded 38 deg C [100.4 deg F], we were suspicious, we forced people to wash their hands, and so on. At the entry points there are many suspected cases which have been found ill after verification. But today nothing is done, we do not know what is expected, "said Mr Wasivinywa.

The mayor of the city of Butembo in turn raised the issue of financial means.

- Fri 19 Feb 2021. International Organization for Migration (IOM): Ebola response
[APO Group-Africa Newsroom, abridged, edited]
https://www.africa-newsroom.com/press/international-organization-for-migration-responds-to-resurgence-of-ebola-in-guinea-and-the-democratic-republic-of-the-congo?

The International Organization for Migration (IOM) is mobilizing staff and resources to help national authorities in Guinea and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) prevent the spread of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) after reports of new outbreaks over the past 2 weeks.

"We need swift containment action on all fronts so that we can save as many lives as possible, and minimize negative impacts on people's health, social and economic well-being," said IOM Director General Antonio Vitorino.

"As both countries are already grappling with COVID-19, health and other essential services are stretched to the very limit."

IOM's public health interventions use analysis of human mobility within and across international borders to inform targeted preparedness and response measures to infectious disease outbreaks.

In Guinea, as of 17 Feb 2021, 3 cases have been confirmed in the southeastern Nzerekore prefecture bordering Liberia and Cote d'Ivoire, and the capital Conakry. This is the 1st time EVD has been reported in the country since the 2014-2016 outbreak, which spread across land borders into Sierra Leone and Liberia claiming more than 11 300 lives.

IOM Guinea is coordinating with the Ministry of Health and has an office in Nzerekore with a public health team that includes 2 physicians and one epidemiologist. IOM has been asked to ramp up surveillance-related activities and will be deploying staff at points of entry along the borders, to support contact tracing, population mobility mapping, and other critical activities. In addition, the Organization is reactivating the public health emergency operation center (PH-EOC) in Nzerekore, seconding a physician, and setting up 2 health screening points in Goueke, the current hotspot.

In the DRC, at least 4 new EVD cases have been reported in North Kivu province in the eastern part of the country as of 17 Feb 2021. The previous outbreak that affected the same area -- the country's 10th EVD outbreak, considered the 2nd largest in the world -- was declared over in June 2020 after claiming the lives of over 3400 people.

An IOM team has been dispatched to Butembo, where the 1st case was detected, to support the health authorities in strengthening surveillance. 3 health screening points were reactivated on 15 Feb 2021 and an update of the existing population mobility mapping exercises is also underway to guide the positioning of additional health screening points.

"After many years of fighting the virus on the ground, alongside communities and public officials, IOM has learned a number of lessons," noted Director General Vitorino. "It is critical to remember that this disease moves fast and its effects can be catastrophic, so there is no time to waste."

IOM's EVD preparedness activities in Guinea and the Democratic Republic of the Congo
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since 2014, IOM Guinea has been working hand in hand with the Government to enhance preparedness by providing technical support for the establishment of PH-EOCs at the national and prefectural levels, strengthening the capacities at points of entry (airports, ports, and land border crossings), supporting the implementation of real-time community-based surveillance through a network of over 9000 volunteers, donating equipment to over 80 health centres, and more.

In the DRC, a challenging operating environment due to ongoing conflict and a protracted humanitarian crisis, IOM has been a key player in the responses to the 9th, 10th, and 11th EVD outbreaks respectively in the provinces of Equateur, North Kivu, and Equateur.

The Organization deployed over 1500 frontline workers who conducted over 194 million health screenings across 169 critical locations in the DRC and neighbouring countries -- South Sudan, Burundi, Rwanda, and Uganda. In addition, over 30 population mobility mapping exercises were carried out within and across borders.

- Fri 19 Feb 2021. African countries on alert
[The Telegraph, edited]

[Byline: Lucinda Rouse]

Officials in Guinea and the DRC are scrambling to identify the scale of outbreaks, amid signs the virus may have spread hundreds of miles

Countries in West and Central Africa are on high alert to the possible spread of 2 separate Ebola outbreaks in Guinea and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), as at least 7 people have died from the virus so far this month [February 2021].

Guinea declared an Ebola epidemic on Sunday [14 Feb 2021] following an outbreak in Goueke in the southeast region of Nzerekore, near the border with Liberia.

The total number of cases, according to a report released by the country's National Agency for Health Security (ANSS) on Friday [19 Feb 2021] stands at 3 confirmed, 4 probable and 1 suspected, including 5 deaths. One of the confirmed cases is in hospital in the capital, Conakry, roughly 500 miles [about 800 km] away from Goueke.

A separate outbreak in North Kivu province in northeastern DRC, first identified on 7 Feb 2021, has been confirmed as resurgence of a protracted outbreak which ended last June [2020], rather than a new virus strain. 2 people have so far died in the latest flare-up; the last took almost 2 years to finally contain.

On Thursday [18 Feb 2021], Congolese health minister Eugene Nzanzu Salita announced 2 cases in Katwa and Manguredjipa, bringing the number of confirmed cases to 6. Manguredjipa almost 100 miles [about 160 km] west of the town of Butembo, around which the other cases are clustered.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Tuesday [16 Feb 2021] that it had requested Guinea's 6 neighbouring countries to be on high alert to possible cross-border spread of the disease. So far none have recorded cases, including Liberia and Sierra Leone, which along with Guinea bore the brunt of the 2013-16 outbreak in which 11 310 people died.

A suspected case in Sierra Leone's Pujehun District on Monday [15 Feb 2021] was found to be negative, according to the Sierra Leonean Ministry of Health. Similarly, a test conducted on a 26-year-old woman who presented with Ebola symptoms at a clinic in the Liberian capital, Monrovia, and had recently travelled from Nzerekore, returned negative on Thursday evening [18 Feb 2021].

Laboratory tests were ongoing for a further 4 suspected cases at the John F Kennedy Medical Centre in Monrovia, according to a written update from Liberia's public health institute on Friday morning [19 Feb 2021].

Ebola vaccination campaigns are either underway or imminent in both outbreak areas. The WHO tweeted on Monday [15 Feb 2021] that a campaign had been launched in Butembo in DRC, starting with health workers at the clinic where the 1st patient was treated.

Meanwhile, 11 000 vaccines are due to arrive in Guinea on Sunday [21 Feb 2021] and vaccination will begin in Nzerekore region on Monday [22 Feb 2021], according to Mohamed Lamine Yansane, a senior adviser to the Guinean health minister. Yansane told a press conference on Thursday [18 Feb 2021] that Guinea had stores of vaccines following the previous outbreak which had since expired. [See next report on delay in vaccine arriving due to fog. - Mod.LK]

Georges Ki-Zerbo, head of the WHO in Guinea, told the Telegraph that health workers and members of the vaccination team would likely be the first to receive the vaccine. He stressed the importance of effective contact tracing to the success of the vaccination campaign.

"They're 2 faces of the same coin," he said. "Contact tracing is key in the epidemiological investigation and intervention to control the train of transmission."

The WHO and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are supporting the Guinean health authorities in contact tracing, which involves the use of digital health tools including geographic information systems (GIS) to map potential contacts.

Questions remain around the identity of the index case in the Guinean outbreak. The 1st recorded case was a nurse who presented at a health centre in Goueke on [18 Jan 2021] and a hospital in Nzerekore 5 days later, where she was diagnosed with typhoid and malaria respectively.

She also visited a traditional practitioner before her death on [28 Jan 2021], according to a WHO statement on Thursday [18 Feb 2021]. Members of her family and attendees at her funeral subsequently fell ill.

A spokeswoman from the government's Ebola response team in Nzerekore told the Telegraph on Thursday [18 Feb 2021] that "in depth investigations are underway to invalidate or confirm the probable index case."

[According to this report, the outbreak in North Kivu has been confirmed as a resurgence of the same strain of Ebola virus that was declared over in June 2020. This suggests it is likely due to the persistent infection in the husband of the index case, but that has not been proven.

This report also confirms that cases outside the country in Sierra Leone and Liberia have been determined to not be Ebola, a big relief. - Mod.LK]

- Sun 21 Feb 2021. Guinea: vaccine delayed
[Yahoo News, Agence France-Presse (AFP) report, abridged, edited]
https://news.yahoo.com/fog-delays-delivery-ebola-vaccines-170624239.html

The delivery to Guinea of vaccines against the Ebola virus has been delayed because of fog disrupting flights to the capital Conakry, a health official said Sunday [21 Feb 2021].

The World Health Organization (WHO) had announced that more than 11 000 doses of the Merck vaccine against the deadly disease were to arrive in Conakry on Sunday [21 Feb 2021].

The plane left Geneva early Sunday but flew on to the Senegalese capital Dakar, according to the head of Guinea's health agency ANSS, Sakoba Keita, who said it would attempt to land in Conakry on Monday [22 Feb 2021], conditions permitting.

The Guinean capital has been cloaked in fog for the past 3 days because of a strong Harmattan wind carrying dust from the Sahara Desert, and a Guinean official told AFP that all flights in and out of Conakry were cancelled "until further notice".

Health authorities said the batch was destined for Nzerekore, the capital of Guinea's southeastern forest region neighbouring Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Ivory Coast where 5 people have died of Ebola.

Keita said the jabs programme would likely be launched in Goueke, near Nzerekore, as well as in Conakry on Tuesday [23 Feb 2021].

In addition to the vaccines expected from the WHO, more than 8500 doses will be delivered from the United States, bringing the total to around 20 000, the WHO said in a statement. "We expect to have more than 100 national & international experts on the ground by the end of the month [February 2021]. 30 vaccination experts have already been mobilized locally are ready to deploy as soon as the Ebola vaccines arrive in the country," the WHO Africa Region's Tshidi Moeti said on Twitter last Thursday [18 Feb 2021].
