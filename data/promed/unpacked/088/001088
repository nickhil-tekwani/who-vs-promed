The Loudoun County (Virginia) Health Department has issued a public notification that several people came into contact with a type of bacterium called Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ (STEC [also referred to as enterohemorrhagic _E coli_ EHEC. - Mod.LL]) after petting goats at a Lovettsville farm, according to a health department press release. The exposure is said to have occurred at Georges Mill Farm between [6 Mar 2022] and [20 Apr 2022].

Monday [25 Apr 2022] evening, Sam Kroiz, owner of Georges Mill, responded on Facebook, saying the bacterium was isolated and identified from the sick people, not the farm. "We are associated in that the undisclosed number of sick people visited the baby goats and we closed visiting 5 days ago when we learned of the association from the Health Department," Kroiz said.

Several individuals experienced diarrhea and other symptoms of illness, according to the release. The bacterium was isolated and identified by the Virginia Division of Consolidated Laboratory Services. The health department said coming into direct contact with animals, particularly livestock, presents a risk for illnesses. People should remember that, while animal interactions can be fun and educational, it is always important to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands after being in contact with animals, according to health department officials.

The Loudoun County Health Department is communicating directly with those who are known to have come in contact with goats at Georges Mill Farm. Anyone who had contact with the goats during the time frame mentioned, and who has not yet communicated with the Health Department should:
- Monitor for illness and seek medical attention if you become ill. Let your healthcare provider know of your possible exposure to assist in your diagnosis and treatment.
- Report your exposure to the Loudoun County Health Department by completing this short survey.

The staff at the farm have assisted the Health Department in identifying who may be at risk of illness and by helping to prevent future infections, the release states. There is no evidence of ongoing risk to visitors at Georges Mill Farm.

[The serotype of EHEC involved here is not stated. The prototypical strain is O157:H7. The number of affected individuals is also not specified.

Initially associated with undercooked ground beef, EHEC can be acquired by ingestion of contaminated produce such as lettuce or bean sprouts, contact with either municipal or recreational water or contact with ungulates or their environment. Petting zoos are well known sources.

Abstract
--------
Despite their general low incidence, Shiga toxin-producing _Escherichia (E.) coli_ (STEC) infections are considered an important public health issue due to the severity of illness that can develop, particularly in young children. We report on 2 Austrian petting zoos, one in Tyrol (2015) and one in Vorarlberg (2016), which were identified as highly likely infection sources of STEC infections. The petting zoo-related cases involved a case of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) due to STEC O157:HNM in 2015 and an outbreak of STEC O157:H7 infections affecting 5 young children and 2 adults in 2016. The HUS case accounted for 2.8% of the 36 STEC O157:HNM/H7 infections notified in Austria in 2015 (5.9% of 17 HUS cases). The 7 cases described for 2016 accounted for 4% of the 177 human STEC infections documented for Austria in 2016, and for 19.4% of the 36 STEC O157:HNM/H7 infections notified that year. The evaluation of the STEC infections described here clearly underlines the potential of sequence-based typing methods to offer suitable resolutions for public health applications. Furthermore, we give a state-of-the-art mini-review on the risks of petting zoos concerning exposure to the zoonotic hazard STEC and on proper measures of risk prevention.
