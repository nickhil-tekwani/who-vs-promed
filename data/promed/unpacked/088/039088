Kangaroo disease may hop to humans
----------------------------
Red roos may have a nasty parasitic skin disease [and may be] the 1st
animal to have the disease in Australia. Australia's iconic
marsupial, the kangaroo, has a skin disease that could spread to
humans, says a team of experts.
While the parasitic disease is not severe, it causes kangaroos to
develop skin ulcers, particularly on the ears and tail.
And while the disease in unlikely to be transmitted directly to
humans, the researchers say it may be transmitted via sandflies.
Dr Kerry Rose from the Australian Registry of Wildlife Health at
Sydney's Taronga Zoo led the research, which was published in the
latest issue of the International Journal for Parasitology.
The research, which was a collaboration between Australian and Swiss
scientists, found that red kangaroos were the 1st animals in
Australia to have this particular type of skin disease, known as
cutaneous leishmaniasis.
The disease is caused by a parasite that belongs to a
yet-to-be-identified species of the genus _Leishmania_, one that
causes a range of diseases in more than 80 countries around the world.
"This is the 1st demonstration that this type of [skin disease]
parasite exists in Australia at all," said co-author Dr Emanuela
Handman from Melbourne's Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical
Research.
In other countries the disease is passed on by sandflies, she said,
and expects sandflies in Australia could do the same. Humans could
become infected when a sandfly takes a blood meal from a kangaroo
infected with the parasite. The parasites then develop in the
sandfly's gut. And if the sandfly takes a bite of a 2nd kangaroo or a
human, they too could be infected.
While rare cases of leishmaniasis have been reported in Australia,
these were from people infected outside the country.
Handman said the researchers had not yet found out whether the
_Leishmania_ parasite was native to Australia.
"Whether it's imported or if it has been here for a very long time we
don't know; we are trying to get a grant to find out," she said.
Other forms of leishmaniasis in humans can cause severe illness,
including vomiting, fever and diarrhoea, and eventually be fatal. But
the skin disease form, if passed on to humans, would be restricted to
ulcers forming around the site of infection, said Handman.
"While normally the _Leishmania_ would infect other animals, if
humans happen to be [in an] area with infected sandflies, then humans
may become infected," Handman said.
In other parts of the world some species of mammalian _Leishmania_
[can] infect humans, while other species, found in guinea pigs,
gerbils and lizards, [can]not, she said.
To gauge the parasite's potential for infecting other mammals, the
researchers infected mouse cells with the parasites in vitro. They
found that the parasites infected the cells, but only at 33 C and not
at the normal human body temperature of 37 C, which surprised the
researchers.
But this did not necessarily rule out infection in humans, as human
skin temperature could be less than 37 C, Handman said.
Handman said the researchers would contact dermatologists to find out
whether they had seen ulcers on humans similar to those found on the
kangaroos. But Handman stressed that there was no evidence so far
that humans could become infected.
"At the moment we cannot tell whether the parasites from kangaroos
are or are not infectious. Based on what we know in other countries,
humans will develop an ulcer at the site if the parasite is
infectious to humans," she said. "But that's a big if."

[This report confirms the presence of _Leishmania_ in 4 kangaroos in
a wild animal park in the Northern Territories. Unfortunately, there
is no mention of the species involved. The potential for
transmission to humans appears to be very low, as we have no reports
of human infection since the new disease was first reported in
kangaroos in July of 2003 - Mod.PC]
