Details of the Kentucky EHV-1 cases
-----------------------------------
Equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) has been confirmed as the cause of
illness in 3 thoroughbreds that were stabled in a training barn at Turfway
Park in Florence, Kentucky. Tuesday's announcement follows treatment and
elimination of several EHV-1 outbreaks in Ohio and Pennsylvania since January.
The EHV-1 organism can cause 3 different forms of disease, including
rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease often affecting young horses),
abortions in pregnant mares, and neurologic disease. Horses in the Ohio and
Pennsylvania outbreaks showed fevers, respiratory illness, and neurological
deficits. In the Kentucky cases, horses have shown fevers, and 2 of the
horses showed neurological signs several days later.
There are at least 7 other strains of equine herpesviruses. Horses can
survive the neurological form of EHV-1 with supportive care, but if a horse
becomes recumbent (stays down), it is difficult to nurse the horse back to
health. The virus doesn't live long in the environment, and it can be
killed with bleach. The strain of EHV-1 isolated in Ohio's outbreaks seems
to have stricken its victims with more intensity than typical EHV-1 strains
would.
Track president Bob Elliston said yesterday that the current outbreak is
probably unrelated to Ohio's outbreaks or the EHV-1 outbreak at Penn
National several weeks ago. The first 2 sick horses from Turfway were sent
to Rood and Riddle Equine Hospital in Lexington, Kentucky March 6. The
third horse developed a fever over last weekend (March 15-16) and is under
treatment in isolation at Turfway.
Bonnie Barr, VMD, of Rood and Riddle, treated the two EHV-1 cases, a 3 year
old gelding and a 4 year old filly. According to Barr, the horses showed
acute neurological signs upon referral to the hospital, and were placed
immediately in an isolation facility. "I was suspicious from the clinical
signs, but we did further testing to rule out other neurological diseases,"
she said. "They were in our isolation facility the whole time they were
here. Both of them had pretty much symmetrical posterior paresis or ataxia,
and one of them actually was recumbent when it got here," she said. "They
both did progress to the point where they had bladder paralysis, a common
clinical manifestation of EHV-1. The recumbent filly did not have to be put
in a sling like several of the Findlay, Ohio cases." Barr and other Rood
and Riddle staff helped the filly get up on her feet, and she never went
back down. Barr and veterinary staff administered anti-inflammatories, an
antiviral drug called acyclovir, and supportive care for the horses. They
collected serum and nasal swabs from the horses, and virus isolation was
completed on the blood at the Gluck Center March 11. Barr explained that
the blood test takes about 5 days to complete. "The blood was the first
test to come back positive, but that was enough to give us our diagnosis
(EHV-1)."
Back at Turfway Park, the third horse is recovering, and the barn has been
quarantined. Only certain people are allowed in and out of the barn, and
must use disinfection protocol. Handlers are regularly taking the
temperatures of all horses which came into contact with horses in the
particular barn, and looking for any unusual signs of illness.
