Cattle contaminated with foot and mouth disease (FMD) were finally
eliminated in Mato Grosso do Sul.
Officers from The Animal & Vegetable Sanitation Defence Agency (IAGRO,
according to its Portuguese initials) in Mato Grosso do Sul, finished last
Saturday evening the culling of cattle contaminated with FMD in Medianeira
III Farm located in Japora Municipality, 464 km from Campo Grande, in the
southernmost part of the state, near the Paraguayan border.
There were 137 infected animals identified last Wednesday by sanitary
officers. Another 11 animals from surrounding farms were destroyed, among
them, 4 newborns.
According to Mr Joao Cavallero, IAGRO chairman, another 3 farms neighboring
Medianeira II are under surveillance, since there may be some contaminated
animals. The number of animals to be eliminated after this surveillance may
reach 100. According to Mr Cavalleiro, this is a hard task because of the
great number of small farms. "In Japora 80 per cent of the farms belong to
small owners, totaling about 30 000 cattle."
According to the federal Agriculture Superintendent, Mr Jose Antonio
Felicio, measures for fighting FMD should not be limited to animal
elimination. "We are currently keeping 1200 animals under observation; all
of them will undergo serological testing, and the entire region will be
covered with respect to detecting any outbreaks".
Japora [is located in the] Eldorado area, where in October 2005 there was a
FMD outbreak, and a sanitary ring was established in 5 municipalities. At
that time 33 700 animals were sacrificed, 27 500 of them in Japora alone.
