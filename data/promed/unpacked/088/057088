The likelihood of a domestic dog or cat being exposed to the Ebola virus through contact with infected persons in Europe is very low, as affected persons are typically isolated promptly.

This is one of the conclusions of an assessment carried out by experts from EFSA, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and Member States on the risks of pets transmitting the Ebola virus to humans in Europe.

Experts identify many knowledge gaps and lack of data in their assessment. For example, there is no evidence that dogs can develop the disease and transmit the virus, nor that cats can become infected.

Experts recommend that the public health and veterinary authorities assess the risk of pets becoming infected and transmitting the disease on a case-by-case basis. The type of contact and the stage of the infection are the 2 factors that authorities should use in their assessment.

They also identify different precautionary measures for different scenarios. These include people's self-monitoring and isolation of pets.

Further work is expected on Ebola in the next months, following requests from the European Commission. EFSA and ECDC will join their efforts again to assess the factors driving the risk of Ebola transmission from animals to humans in Western Africa, a so-called spillover event.

EFSA has also been asked to provide scientific advice on the risk of transmission of Ebola through the food chain. In particular, EFSA will assess the risks associated with the consumption of raw food imported from African affected countries. At the beginning of November 2014, EFSA assessed the risk of transmission of Ebola through bushmeat.

Notes to editors:
Risk related to household pets in contact with Ebola cases in humans: In this assessment, pets are defined as household dogs and cats kept in the house and with which the owner has close physical contact.

For subscribers' convenience, we hereby copy the chapters "Conclusions" and "recommendations" of the EFSA review:

a. CONCLUSIONS
1. Probability of a pet entering in contact with a human EVD case:
- The circumstances through which a pet might become infected in the EU are different to those that pertain in West Africa.
- The probability of a pet having contact with a human case is assessed to be low considering the very few secondary cases or returning cases seen in the EU.
2. Probability of a pet in contact with a human EVD case becoming infected or contaminated with EBOV:
- In the event of contact with a symptomatic human EVD case, the probability of the pet becoming infected or acting as a contaminated fomite can range from very low to high (according to the type of symptoms of the human case and the contact experienced), but the associated uncertainty is high.
- This probability can be considered negligible when the human EVD case is asymptomatic, as it is assumed that no EBV is excreted.
- Any human EVD cases with florid disease in the EU would, in principle, be isolated very rapidly, hence the probability of a pet entering into contact with a human florid case is considered to be low.
3. Probability of a pet infected or contaminated with EBOV being capable of transmitting it to an uninfected human:
- There is high uncertainty about viraemia, virus shedding or clinical signs in pets, and about pets acting as fomites.
- The probability of human exposure to the virus through contact with exposed pets is difficult to estimate but may range from very low to high depending on the specific circumstances.
4. Other questions:
- Appropriate and adapted precautions must be taken during transport and isolation of pets and laboratory handling of samples to a similar level of biosafety as those recommended for suspected EVD cases in humans.

b. RECOMMENDATIONS
- The risk of a pet in contact with a human case becoming infected with EBOV should be assessed on a case-by-case basis.
- The risk of a pet with EBOV being capable of transmitting the virus to an uninfected human should be assessed on a case-by-case basis.
- The veterinary authorities and public health authorities should conduct assessments jointly.
