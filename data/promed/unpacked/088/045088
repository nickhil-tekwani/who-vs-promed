Proposed amendments to EC Regulation 999/2001 on transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies -- goat specified risk material
--------------------------------------------------
Comments are sought on proposed possible changes to EC Regulation 999/2001
following an announcement by the European Commission of a possible finding
of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in a French goat. It is proposed
that these changes will only be implemented if BSE is confirmed in the
suspect animal.
EC Regulation 999/2001 (as amended) lays down community-wide rules for the
prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies (TSEs). These rules are amended as necessary in light of
new findings and emerging scientific evidence.
On 28 Oct 2004, the European Commission announced a possible finding of BSE
in a French goat. In accordance with EU procedures, the finding was
submitted to the Community Reference Laboratory (CRL) in Weybridge for
evaluation by an expert panel. The Commission issued a subsequent
announcement on 26 Nov 2004 stating that the expert panel had met and
concluded that currently available results were incomplete, and a further 2
months were required before all the results could be properly interpreted.
The results of the CRL evaluation are therefore expected in the New Year.
Although BSE had never before been found naturally occurring in goats, the
possibility that it could exist, masked by scrapie, has been acknowledged
for some time. This is because it is likely that some goats ate the same
feed that spread BSE in cattle, and laboratory experiments have shown that
BSE can be transmitted to sheep and goats. As a result, precautionary
measures, such as SRM controls, have been in place for some time to
minimise any potential risk to public health.
In its opinion of April 2002, the EC Scientific Steering Committee (SSC)
recommended additional measures to protect public health in the event that
BSE should become likely in small ruminants. In view of the possible
finding of BSE in a French goat, the Commission is proposing that the
additional measures recommended in the SSC opinion should be implemented,
if the finding of BSE is confirmed.
The draft EC proposal was discussed at an EU TSE Working Group meeting on
30 Nov 2004 and will be subject to further discussions at SCoFCAH (Standing
Committee of Food Chain and Animal Health) in December and January. It is
unlikely that SCoFCAH will vote on the proposal until the views of the CRL
expert panel are known. These are expected at the end of January 2005 [full
text <http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/goatria.pdf>].
One effect of the proposal will be a change to the list of tissues that are
designated as specified risk material (SRM) in goats. As the proposal
currently stands, the list of tissues designated SRM in goats will be
extended to include:
- the whole alimentary canal;
- the organs, including lymph nodes, of the thoracic and abdominal cavities;
- the pre-femoral and pre-scapular lymph nodes;
- the entire head;
- the tonsils.
These tissues would be designated SRM in goats of all ages. Spinal cord
will remain SRM in goats over 12 months of age. At present, only the spleen
and ileum are designated SRM in goats of all ages, while the skull
(including the brain and eyes), tonsils and spinal cord are designated SRM
in goats aged over 12 months of age.
At this stage, the FSA is inclined to support the extension of the tissues
to be classified as SRM. The EC proposals would remove most of the tissues
that are associated with BSE infectivity in an infected animal. Unlike in
cattle, the lymph nodes in sheep and goats have been shown to carry TSE
infectivity in infected animals. However, removal of all lymph nodes would
not be practicable.
We would welcome your views on any benefits or drawbacks likely to result
from the changes, in particular, on the potential cost of the proposals and
practical aspects of removing the additional SRM. Your views will help to
formulate the UK negotiating position on this issue. It will not be
possible to accurately assess the impact of the measures without this feedback.
If the proposals do become European law then domestic legislation, in this
case the TSE (Scotland) Regulations 2002 (and equivalent legislation in
England, Wales, and Northern Ireland), will require amendment to take
account of the new European Regulation. In addition to informing you of the
Commission proposals, we are also informing you of a possible new domestic
requirement, relating to goats, if the Commission proposals receive a
positive vote. At present, there is no difference between tissues
designated SRM in goats and tissues designated SRM in sheep. That position
will change if the proposals relating to goat SRM are accepted. As it would
be difficult to differentiate between sheep and goats once carcasses have
been dressed, it would be necessary to introduce an additional measure to
enable such differentiation for enforcement purposes. We would therefore
need to consider introducing a "goat stamp" to aid correct identification
and removal of SRM. This stamp would probably be applied by the Meat
Hygiene Service. We would welcome your views on this proposal and any
effects -- positive or negative -- it might be likely to have.

[The rapid response of the EU to the published results of the French
research on suspected BSE infection in goats reflects the significant
change which international and national animal- and public-health agencies
have undergone in view of the sad BSE history, especially since 1996. Such
a response was almost unimaginable beforehand.
The total number of adult goats in EU's 25 member countries is about 9.5
million, compared with 66 million adult sheep. The impact of the amendment
in the UK will be rather limited. Being one of the 2 leading sheep breeding
EU countries (the other one is Spain), UK's adult goat population is
reportedly only 49 000. The leading goat breeding countries are (millions
of adult animals): Greece (3.9), Spain (2.33), France (1.03), Italy (0.82),
Portugal (0.39), Cyprus (0.3) and Netherlands (0.2).
Responses to the above consultation are required by 6 Mar 2005. Since a
meeting of SCoFCAH is likely to be held in mid-January 2005, however,
preliminary views have been requested, if possible, by 7 Jan 2005. Further
details, including address for responses, conditions for their publication,
etc, are to be seen at the above URL. - Mod.AS]
