A bid to save macadamia crops
------------------------------
After watching the fall of coffee farming in Kenya a decade ago,
farmers now fear that another cash crop will also go into decline as a
new disease preys on macadamia trees.

Jesca Mbaka, Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI), found 2
major fungal diseases to be the cause. "There is a growing prevalence
of 2 main diseases, namely root rot and stem canker -- both caused by
the fungus _Phytophthora cinnamomi_," she said. Though the pathogen is
not new in Kenya, it is the 1st time it has been seen to have an
extensive effect on macadamia.

Mbaka has completed a study at the University of Stellenbosch in South
Africa, where she discovered that there is only one type of the
pathogen affecting macadamia and other trees in Kenya. The study
recommended a range of fungicides, but pointed out that there was a
need to carry out [further] tests.

Mbaka is now looking at ways on how her studies can be implemented for
the benefit of smallholder farmers in Africa. South Africa, a country
also affected by the disease, is considered the 3rd largest producer
of macadamia in the world. However, other African countries including
Kenya are beginning to consider commercial farming of the crop. It is
estimated that over 10 000 Kenyan farmers have ventured into farming
macadamia as a cash crop mainly for the export market.

[The fungus-like organism _Phytophthora cinnamomi_ has a wide host
range, but different host genera may show different levels of
sensitivity. While symptoms vary between hosts, on trees and shrubs
(including crops like avocado, macadamia, olive and some pine species)
it mainly causes root rots and stem cankers which destroy the host's
access to water and nutrients. Symptoms usually include yellowing of
foliage followed by dieback, and sudden death of the host may occur
when additional water stress is imposed by a dry season. The pathogen
is soil borne. It is spread with soil and plant material, by water and
mechanical means (often by contaminated equipment and human
activities). Disease management is difficult and may include cultural
practices (phytosanitary measures, nutritional improvements), and
removal or burning of affected plants. Trunk injections with
phosphorous compounds have been shown to be effective in some tree
species, for example for jarrah dieback and avocado root rot in
Australia.

Commercial _Macadamia_ (family Proteaceae) cultivars are derived from
subtropical species native to eastern Australia. _P. cinnamomi_ has
caused immeasurable damage to eucalypts and other native vegetation
(including many Proteaceae) after its introduction to Australia.
Eradication or control of phytophthora diseases of trees in Australia
and North America have been largely unsuccessful. This highlights the
seriousness of the report above.

The genus includes some of the most destructive crop pathogens (for
example, _P. infestans_ causing potato late blight). _P. kernoviae_
and _P. ramorum_ are considered serious pathogens of native trees and
shrubs in Europe and North America.
