Regarding the woman receiving post exposure prophylaxis [PEP] for being kicked by a deer: this practice is not in line with the CDC or with the Compendium of Animal Rabies Prevention and Control 2011.

Proving beyond a shadow of a doubt that various animals could or could not transmit rabies to humans would involve "challenging" vaccinated humans with rabies virus, which will never happen. But in ignoring the real risk (and non-risk) of rabies, thousands of people continue to receive unnecessary rabies prophylaxis for exposure to rabid animals, and precious public health dollars are unnecessarily squandered.

All warm-blooded animals are susceptible to rabies, and almost all animals who are exposed and become infected will die of the disease; only a few species of animals function as reservoirs for the disease and are able to infect other animals.

In the last 20-30 years, it has become evident that there are variants of rabies viruses; each individual variant of rabies appears to perpetuate itself in nature through repeated transmissions only in the mammalian species for which it is adapted. Specific variants remain endemic within a species population. The skunk variant circulates among skunks, raccoon variant among raccoons, bat to bat, etc.

When the virus is transmitted outside the "normal" host species population, or "spills over" to an alternate species (such as the gray fox rabies variant in a cow), rabies usually presents as a single rabies case and does not continue to spread. The victim becomes a dead end host literally and figuratively. A coyote infected with the raccoon variant would not establish the raccoon variant in the local coyote population, for example.

In the US, because they are vaccinated at a lower rate, many more cats are diagnosed with rabies than dogs and "expose" more humans. Thus, they are the main cause for immunoprophalaxis in the US. But there is no cat or feline strain of rabies, so these cats which are dying of raccoon or bat rabies are very, very likely dead end hosts.

Cats are relatively resistant to rabies. Cows and horses are highly susceptible. Humans and dogs are moderately susceptible to different variants, humans being most susceptible (15 percent risk rate upon exposure) to some bat strains and canine rabies. It is the close association of the domestic dog with humans which makes canine rabies the culprit in 95 percent of human rabies cases worldwide.

Canine rabies infects dogs, coyotes and wolves; it is that association that makes continued surveillance and canine vaccination in the US important. There have been no endemic cases of canine rabies in the US since 2004, aided by improved control in Mexico. That low rabies risk may rise if inadequate vaccination and quarantining of domestic dogs imported for the pet trade from places like India and Russia continues.

Note: The oft quoted 50 000 human deaths worldwide yearly has been recently challenged by Merritt Clifton, a ProMED contributor, as highly inflated.

The historical fear of rabies, based on how horrific the death is for most victims, continues to trump science, even though, realistically, someone dying of rabies in a US hospital in 2012 suffers less than the average CHF [congestive heart failure] patient, as they are generally in medically induced comas. The majority of human rabies victims (about 10 per year in the US), if interviewed while still coherent, knew they were bitten by a high risk species and failed to seek treatment.

The public health cost of rabies prophylaxis in the USA has been estimated to be from USD 100 000 to one million per potential life saved, and that estimate ignores the high percentage of human exposures by dead end hosts and thus is even higher. Beyond the financial costs, while treatment, if started soon enough is 100 percent effective, immunoprophalaxis is not without risk of reactions.

The CDC recommendations include these statements:

"The rabies virus is transmitted through saliva or brain/nervous system tissue. You can only get rabies by coming in contact with these specific bodily excretions and tissues. The contamination of open wounds, abrasions, mucous membranes, or theoretically, scratches (potentially contaminated with infectious material from a rabid animal) constitutes a nonbite exposure. Other contact by itself, such as petting a rabid animal and contact with blood, urine, or feces of a rabid animal, does not constitute an exposure and is not an indication for post-exposure vaccination."

Reading those recommendations, it is hard to see how treatment was justified for exposure by a deer kick.

[While it may be regrettable, it is not required that any state follow the CDC guidelines, nor is any state required to follow the Compendium of Animal Rabies Prevention and Control 2011. They are recommendations and guidelines, not law. Consequently, if there was deemed to be a risk of some fashion that may not have been shared with the newspaper or journal, then PEP may have been appropriate. On the surface, a deer kick does not warrant rabies post exposure prophylaxis. What we may not know are more details, such as was the deer slobbering and did the woman wipe its mouth? Only details of the kick may have been transmitted by the officer or the person.

Unless the reporting authority or a medical person can provide us with further details on this incident, this thread is now closed. - Mod.TG
