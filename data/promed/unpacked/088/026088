Growers fear high incidence of apple scab
------------------------------------------
With rains showing no signs of let up, farmers are skeptical that the
horticultural produce would develop scab, which experts and growers
fear can take the shape of an epidemic if not controlled on time.

Prof Kamal Farooqi, Kashmir University of Agriculture Science and
Technology, said the cold climate followed by rains and then again
the high temperature of 25-27 deg C [77-81 deg F] can tell on the
fruit. "This is a congenial environment for scab development which
disfigures the fruit. It will affect the marketability," he said.

Farooqi said that orchards should be drained out. "If the temperature
rises again, pockets of humidity would cause more scab to mature
causing an epidemic. No compromise should be made," he warned. The
University has released scab resistant varieties of apple, which can
save the farmers. "University should popularize these varieties," he said.

With the fear of scab on the increase, pathologists have suggested
the use of fungicides mixed with "stickers" which will not wash away
if it rains again. Meanwhile, farmers alleged that the horticulture
department has not taken any step for checking the spread of the
disease. Farmers have to use chemicals repeatedly, which has
increased their input costs and [are asking for subsidised agrochemicals].

[Apple scab (also called black spot) is caused by the fungus
_Venturia inaequalis_ and is considered the most economically
important disease of apples worldwide. Infected fruit is often
unmarketable and losses can be more than 70 percent. The pathogen
infects only species of _Malus_, while other fungi in the same genus
are known to cause scab diseases on different fruit crops. Symptoms
may include dark leaf spots, premature leaf fall, and fruit lesions.
Early infections often result in severely cracked and malformed fruit
and are most damaging since fruit becomes more resistant as it matures.

The fungus overwinters in infected leaves on the ground. Spores are
spread with infected plant material, by mechanical means, splashing
rain and carried long distances in air currents. Disease management
is expensive requiring up to 12 fungicide sprays a year in areas
where scab has become established. Apple cultivars vary in their
susceptibility to scab. Resistant varieties are available, but few of
them are currently suitable for commercial production.

While apples are mentioned in the report above as being affected by
scab, other "horticultural produce" is also being referred to, and
perhaps other fruit crops are also considered at risk (for example,
pears from _V. pirina_).
