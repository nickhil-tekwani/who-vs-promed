Today [9 Jul 2013] the Rhode Island Department of Health reported that stool specimens from 19 of the patients who became ill with diarrheal illness after swimming at Spring Lake Beach [Providence county, Rhode Island] on 4 Jul 2013 are positive for the bacterium _Shigella sonnei_.

The department began investigating the outbreak of gastrointestinal illness associated with the public swimming area on 6 Jul 2013. To date, 92 individuals have been identified as ill and 16 have been hospitalized with bloody diarrhea. All swam at Spring Lake Beach in Burrillville on 4 Jul 2013. The department believes that the shigellosis came from fecal contamination of the water on that date.

Approximately 80 percent of the people who are ill are children under 18 years of age. Hospitalized cases at Hasbro Children's Hospital are recovering well and no severe illness has been reported in adults.

"Anyone who recently swam at Spring Lake and is experiencing diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, or vomiting should see his or her doctor," said Michael Fine, MD, Director of Health.

The Health Department is reopening Spring Lake Beach for swimming beginning tomorrow [10 Jul 2013], as water test results from Sunday [7 Jul 2013] and Monday [8 Jul 2013] show no evidence of fecal coliform bacteria. In addition, _Shigella_ does not survive outside the body for long periods and does not survive in warm temperatures. The water temperature in Spring Lake has been high over the last several days.

"Town officials from Burrillville were extremely helpful throughout this investigation," said Dr. Fine. "I thank them for their cooperation and assistance."

All licensed beaches in Rhode Island are now open for swimming. (Oakland Beach in Warwick, which had been closed since late June [2013] because of high bacteria counts, also is reopening on 10 Jul 2013).
