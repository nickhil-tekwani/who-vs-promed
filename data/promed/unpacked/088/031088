Red tide's poison may have killed a dozen humpbacks in North Atlantic. A
deadly alga is the leading suspect in the mass death of humpback whales
around 150 miles off Cape Cod, say marine experts.
Carcass sightings suggest that at least 12 whales, mostly humpbacks, have
died in the Georges Bank area, making it one of the worst known mass
fatalities. "It's really quite disturbing," says whale biologist Phillip
Clapham of the Northeast Fisheries Science Center in Woods Hole, Massachusetts.
A red tide of the toxic algae _Alexandrium fundyense_ is the most likely
culprit. The algae's poison, saxitoxin, killed 14 whales in the same area
in 1987. Saxitoxin can accumulate in mackerel, which whales eat.
Unusual currents or weather may have carried the algae to Georges Bank from
the coast of Maine and Massachusetts, where they bloom each summer. The
algal toxin also poisons people when it gets into mussels and clams.
Investigators are currently analyzing the whales' blood, urine, and skin
for traces of the poison -- results are expected later this week.
Only one of the dead whales has obvious wounds from fishing tackle or
ships. There is a slim chance that the animals died after acoustic damage
caused by navy sonar, says Michael Moore of Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution in Massachusetts, who is involved in the investigation. Until a
fresher carcass than the ones already found is towed in and dissected, "we
can't rule in or out those events", he says.
Mass whale die-offs -- at least those discovered -- are rare. But blooms of
other harmful algae routinely kill dolphins, sea lions and otters off the
southern Californian coast and elsewhere.
The alarm was first raised on 3 July, when researchers found 3 dead
humpbacks in Georges Bay during a routine aerial survey. The normal
head-count is one whale every few weeks. "It was enough to make us
concerned," says Clapham.
The region's humpback population is thriving and will probably survive the
losses. But the deaths raise fears that the endangered Northern Atlantic
right whale population -- just 320 animals -- might also be affected. These
mammals feed in the Gulf of Maine during summer. Right whales might escape
acute poison buildups because they eat plankton rather than fish. "There is
no indication they've been affected so far," says Jerry Conway, marine
mammal adviser to the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans.
