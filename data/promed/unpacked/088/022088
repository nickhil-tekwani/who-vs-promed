[A press release from South African government, Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development, published on 13 Apr 2021, mentioned that "Approximately 300 birds died of [avian influenza, AI] on this commercial chicken-layer farm. The samples from this farm that were sent to the laboratory tested positive for the H5 strain of AI. It must be said that this farm was also part of the H5N8 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreak in 2017.

"Upon confirmation that it was H5, the birds in the affected house were immediately destroyed. Arrangements were made for samples to be urgently tested at Onderstepoort Veterinary Research (OVR), to determine the pathotype (whether it is high [HPAI] or low pathogenic avian influenza [LPAI] as well as to determine the N-type of the virus. The results have not yet come back.

"The Gauteng Veterinary Authorities placed the farm under quarantine and are busy with an investigation of the outbreak. They are performing back and forward tracing, to determine the extent of the outbreak and assist with safe disposal of dead chickens and disinfection of the farm." See the full statement at https://www.gov.za/speeches/outbreak-avian-influenza-ai-commercial-chicken-layer-farm-gauteng-13-apr-2021-0000.

Although the statement notes that the pathotype needs to be determined, the causal agent of the outbreak has already been reported to the OIE as HPAI H5. The neuraminidase type is still pending. - Mod.CRD
