Samples of 63 dead birds are in on their way to Texas Veterinary
Medical Diagnostic Laboratory in order to solve a mystery on Congress Ave.
Someone spotted a few of those dead grackles around 3 a.m. Monday and
called police.
The theory health experts are leaning toward is that this may be an
intentional poisoning. [It is not uncommon to find the avicide
Avitrol used in these types of cases, - Mod.TG]
Initially, police and firefighters called in all emergency responders
to rule out air contamination and terror attacks.
The hazardous material teams collected the bird from the streets,
sidewalks, and rooftops. Sixty-three dead birds, mostly grackles with
a few pigeons and sparrows in the mix.
Police shut down Congress Ave. from Cesar Chavez to 11th Street and
one block on either side until a little after noon. Health officials
immediately tested the air, called emergency rooms to check for
unusual illnesses that might be related, then tested the birds on site.
"The external feathers, based on some of the on site gas
chromatography testing that we did, were negative for any type of
volatile chemicals," said Dr. Adolfo Valadez, medical director for
Austin/Travis County Health and Human Services Department.
Health officials say this does not appear to be bird flu and it's the
wrong time of year for West Nile Virus. But nothing gets ruled out
until they get bacteria and virus tests back from Texas A&M and bird
flu test back from a lab in Ames, Iowa [The National Veterinary
Services Laboratory, NVSL].
"We may suspect a poisoning of those birds, but again I don't have
any confirmation of that, and, again, I still need final testing,"
Valadez said.
Experts say there is always the possibility of natural causes. They
say birds aren't the cleanest animals. They drink contaminated water
and spread disease quickly. The bottom line, health experts quickly
figured out there was no risk to public health and reopened the main
artery of downtown Austin.
Valadez says the tests they're waiting on will take days if not weeks.
Austin police say, if it turns out someone did poison these birds on
purpose, they could face criminal charges for violating health codes
or for unlicensed use of pesticides.
If you find suspicious dead birds, the health authority asks you call
311, so the city can compile that information.

Public health officials were scratching their heads over what killed
more than 60 grackles, pigeons and sparrows found dead along Congress
Avenue near the state Capitol on Monday morning, prompting a downtown
lockdown that scrambled traffic and kept thousands of employees home from work.
By early afternoon, they had determined that whatever killed the
birds wasn't harmful to humans, and 10 blocks in the heart of
downtown were reopened.
"We've have no information that leads us to believe that there is any
threat," Michael McDonald, Austin assistant city manager for public
safety, said during a news conference. "We are going to be conducting
further analysis."
Authorities said early necropsies indicated that bird flu is not the
culprit and that West Nile virus is highly unlikely, because the
disease is seasonal. Air tests were negative for natural gas and
other chemicals, and the birds' feathers showed no signs of
pesticides. Officials all but ruled out environmental factors; the
city had no inclement weather.
Officials said they believe the birds were probably poisoned or
suffered from a bacterial infection. A determination will take days or weeks.
The dead birds were first reported around 3 a.m., prompting a public
health emergency that forced officers, ambulances and hazardous
materials teams to descend on and cordon off downtown.
Of the 63 dead birds, most were found on Congress Avenue several
blocks south of the Capitol, officials said. Congress Avenue leads up
to the Capitol, which did not close.
"It's not uncommon for birds to die in groups," McDonald said.
"What's uncommon is for it to happen in the downtown area."
No human illness or injury was reported, though Chris Callsen,
assistant director of Austin-Travis County Emergency Medical
Services, said 2 officers on the scene reported feeling sick Monday
morning. No one was transported to the hospital.
Early-morning passers-by said the birds first began acting strange --
wandering aimlessly in the street, attempting to fly and making crash
landings -- and then dropped like flies. For most of the morning,
downtown Austin was tangled in stop-and-go traffic and blinking
emergency lights.
Hazmat teams in yellow plastic suits and rubber boots patrolled
Congress Avenue, collecting dead birds and checking the roofs of
office buildings for more. The birds are being sent to virology
centers at Texas A&M and in Ames, Iowa , for further testing.

Subject: Undiagnosed avian die off
-----------------
In Austin, Texas, USA, there were over 60 avians (grackels, sparrows,
and pidgeons) found dead along Congress Ave. ERT [?emergency
response teams] teams and other health officials were there and had
collected the birds to send off for diagnostic testing. They do not
believe at this time that this is due to the avian influenza but that
of poisoning. There have been cases where poisoned grain had been
placed on the roofs of buildings in hopes of thinning out the bird
populations. There is no confirmatory results at this time.

[According to one article there were 63 birds, which in the face of
the perhaps thousands of grackles and pigeons is miniscule. It is not
uncommon for people to use Avitrol, an avian repellant, to try and
convince the birds to leave. The excitement of the bird colonies when
Avitrol is used sometimes results in some deaths. This would not be
uncommon. A discussion of Avitrol can be found on ProMED-mail post
20030215.0391.
Sources in Austin believe this was an excuse to exercise the hazmat
people, an opportunity for them to wear their suits without the
oppressive heat of Texas summers.
Weather reports indicate that the temperatures have had severe swings
but are seasonal for this time of year. Lows have been ranging to
approximately 30 degrees F while daytime temperatures may reach 60
degrees F. If the temperatures were more severe, it is possible that
it could be a case of cold shock. But I might expect more birds were
that the case.
With temperatures having such a wide swing, it is possible that the
birds, hungry in the early dawn and late evening, consumed some less
than wholesome material in the area and became sick from food
poisoning. More likely this would be called salmonellosis. Sick birds
can easily look drunk or have odd behavior.
It is the wrong time of year for birds to become intoxicated from
fermented berries, and literally die from the fermented berries, or
alcohol poisoning.
Cases like this have existed in Texas in the past and have been the
result of avitrol use or from salmonellosis.
Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory and the National
Veterinary Services Laboratory will have results within a few days.
We look forward to an authoritative report from someone at the
laboratories. - Mod.TG]
