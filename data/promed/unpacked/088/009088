5 cows contract rabies
----------------------
Vermont agriculture officials are urging farmers to vaccinate theiir
cows for rabies after 5 have tested positive for the disease. The
cows were likely infected by a rabid raccoon.

WCAX-TV says it's unclear why rabies cases in cows are increasing.
But one veterinarian suspects farmers may have dropped the vaccine as
a cost-cutting measure.

The rabid cows pose a minimal risk to humans. No one has ever
contracted rabies from drinking milk but the Centers for Disease
Control says people who drink raw milk from a rabid cow are at risk
for the disease. Farm workers also are at risk.

[It has been a battle to get producers to vaccinate cattle. If the
Vermont veterinarian believes that the vaccinations have been dropped
because of economic reasons, then Vermont has been more successful
than most of us at getting the producer to vaccinate for rabies.

I have long been an advocate of rabies vaccine in all mammalian
creatures that we deal with since it is a very cheap insurance for
us. If that bovine is a show animal or milk animal or a pet and we
are petting, brushing, or in any way having close contact with than
animal, then it should be vaccinated against rabies.

This article does not tell us over what period of time these animals
have been diagnosed with rabies. It also does not allow us to know if
they were all in the same part of the state or if they were owned by
the same owner. It may be part of an epidemiological investigation
regarding who may not be vaccinating, or if there is a perhaps a
change in the strain of rabies present in a particular area.

Rabies in cattle is not uncommon. Cattle are curious creatures if a
raccoon or skunk is not acting quite right, then they will
investigate, frequently being bitten on the nose or occasionally on the leg.

There are a number of diseases capable of passing to the milk. Those
who are insistent about consuming raw milk put themselves at risk of
a number of diseases. While CDC does not report any human contacting
rabies through milk, it may only be that the case was not reported
but it has occurred. If you have consumed raw milk from one of the
locations having a rabid cow, then you should discuss rabies
vaccination with your physician. - Mod.TG

[Back in February 2009, 2 cows died in Vermont and owners were urged
to get their gattle vaccinated -- see 1st ProMED ref. below. - Mod.JW]
