----------------------------------
Monkeypox cases in West Africa and Central Africa:
Since the global eradication of smallpox, monkeypox has emerged as the most prevalent orthopoxvirus infection in humans. The majority of documented human monkeypox cases have occurred in Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where it was 1st recognized as a human disease in 1970; however, during the last decade, the number of cases in other west and central African countries have been increasing; many of these countries had not reported a case for several decades [Table/Figure -- available at the source URL above]. Since 2016, monkeypox cases have been reported and confirmed from Central African Republic (19 cases), DRC (more than 1000 reported per year), Liberia (2), Nigeria (more than 80), Republic of the Congo (88), and Sierra Leone (1) (Table); an outbreak in captive chimpanzees occurred in Cameroon. With 80 confirmed cases, Nigeria is currently experiencing the largest documented outbreak of human monkeypox in West Africa. The emergence of cases is a concern for global health security.

Monkeypox is a zoonotic orthopoxvirus with a similar disease presentation to smallpox in humans, with the additional distinguishing symptom of lymphadenopathy. After an initial febrile prodrome, a centrifugally distributed maculopapular rash develops, with lesions often present on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. The infection can last up to 4 weeks, until crusts separate, and a fresh layer of skin is formed. Sequelae include secondary bacterial infections, respiratory distress, bronchopneumonia, gastrointestinal involvement, dehydration, encephalitis, and ocular infections, which can result in permanent corneal scarring. No specific treatment for a monkeypox virus infection currently exists, and patients are managed with supportive care and symptomatic treatment. In persons who have not been vaccinated against smallpox, which offers cross-protection, the case fatality rate is 11 percent. Human-to-human transmission occurs via respiratory droplets and contact with lesions that contain the virus.

Monkeypox primarily occurs in the rain forests in West Africa and Central Africa. Although antibodies have been detected in a range of small mammal species, the reservoir species of monkeypox remains unknown, and the virus has been isolated only twice from wild animals, once from a rope squirrel (_Funisciurus anerythrus_) in DRC and once from a sooty mangabey (_Cercocebus atys_) in Cote d'Ivoire. Contact with the animal reservoir/reservoirs, including contact with live or dead animals, often through the hunting and preparation of bushmeat as food, is a presumed driver of monkeypox infection. Closer contact between humans and animals through deforestation, demographic changes, climate change, hunting, and population movement might account for the recent increase in reported cases and expansion of geographic range. Civil war and population displacement can force inhabitants to seek alternative sources of protein, including the consumption of monkeys, squirrels, and other rodents.

Vaccination against smallpox is known to be cross-protective against the other orthopoxviruses, including monkeypox. Following the eradication of smallpox in 1980 and the cessation of smallpox vaccination in the early 1980s, waning vaccine-induced population immunity and lack of protection among younger age groups might have contributed to the resurgence of the disease.

Monkeypox virus has 2 recognized clades: West African and Congo Basin. Differences in epidemiologic and clinical features between viral isolates support the distinction between these 2 clades. Advances in the use of DNA sequencing to understand viral strains and populations will be valuable for interpreting transmission events and confirming the existence of endemic variants. Further studies are needed to understand temporal and spatial genetic differences in viral strains.

Discussion
--------
Monkeypox presents challenges for public health officials and health care personnel in terms of surveillance and laboratory capacities, and management and treatment of disease.

Laboratory confirmation of infection is critical, because human monkeypox closely resembles several other febrile rash illnesses including smallpox and varicella. The appropriate specimens for identification of the virus in active cases of monkeypox are swabs or crusts of lesions, in contrast to blood, serum, and sputum specimens collected by clinicians and laboratory technicians for diagnosis of many other diseases, and specimens must be accompanied by detailed clinical information for appropriate interpretation of laboratory results.

The increase in number of monkeypox cases being reported from countries in Africa that have not reported cases in several decades and the myriad factors that affect monkeypox transmission highlight the need to update knowledge about the disease and strengthen preparedness efforts. To address gaps in knowledge and expertise in areas with endemic disease, a number of areas of work are being prioritized by WHO in collaboration with CDC. To improve understanding of mechanisms of virus transmission, both zoonotic and interhuman, national disease surveillance systems need to be strengthened for humans, as well as for wildlife, using community-based event reporting. In countries with endemic disease, this includes the reporting of all suspected cases through the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response system, collection of relevant disease-specific data to support laboratory diagnostic and epidemiological interpretation, and follow-up of confirmed cases.

Improvements in laboratory capacity require training in laboratory procedures, the types of specimens to collect, and safe specimen collection, storage, and transportation. Improvements in the capacity to detect monkeypox virus have been found to increase zoonotic disease detection and response, as seen during the Ebola virus disease response in Tshuapa Province of DRC. Regional trainings to increase national-level expertise and the sharing of country-level experiences will have the potential to build a network for exchange of best practices and technical support. Global health security will benefit from additional efforts to build regional-level capacity.

As with all zoonotic diseases, a comprehensive One Health approach is necessary for disease detection and response, including wildlife surveillance and investigations into the animal reservoir/reservoirs, which require dedicated resources. Multicountry collaborations are important for sharing experiences, developing stronger national and regional capacities, and alerting neighboring countries of cases of monkeypox in humans and animals. Unlike smallpox, a human disease with no animal reservoir that was eradicated through vaccination campaigns, monkeypox has an animal reservoir/reservoirs. Insights into the animal reservoir and ecological niche will enable monitoring the virus's movements outside the natural ecological setting. Improving understanding of monkeypox will aid in developing innovative solutions to mitigate further spread of the virus. Furthermore, improved detection and response capacity for monkeypox will enhance capacity for responding to other zoonoses and orthopoxvirus events at regional and national levels.

[This report provides an interesting overview of the occurrence of human monkeypox cases in Africa over past years. Interested ProMED-mail readers may wish to read the entire report that can be accessed at the source URL above. The main reservoirs of monkeypox virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp; an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_). Halting the bushmeat trade and consumption of wild animals in order to halt MPX virus exposure will be culturally and economically difficult, so continued occurrence of cases can be expected.

[The most recent extensive monkeypox (MPX) outbreak is the one in Nigeria, where there have been 172 suspected and 61 confirmed cases in 14 states from September to December 2017. A 26 Mar 2018 report indicates that there are 2 suspected MPCX cases in Adamawa state with a cumulative case count of 6 with 1 death (https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/adamawa-state-integrated-disease-surveillance-and-response-idsr-nigeria-emergency-7). These cases are not included in the above report.

The question remains about the source of these recent infections within Nigeria and more recently in the Central African Republic. In Nigeria, infection of the index case was acquired within the country. With no cross-state relationships of cases and preliminary genetic sequencing suggesting multiple sources of introduction of MPX virus into the human population, one wonders whether there is an MPXV epizootic going on in rodent hosts across a relatively wide geographic area in Nigeria. Studies of prevalence of MPXV in populations of rodent hosts are not mentioned in this or in previous reports.
