The chikungunya outbreak appears to have taken hold in Singapore, with over 60 reported cases of infection this month alone [May 2013]. This brings this year's total to 184, more than 3 times the 60 cases that were reported over the past 3 years.

The infections currently appear to be centred on the industrial area in Sungei Kadut and along Bukit Timah Road.

A Ministry of Health (MOH) spokesman said at least 37 of those identified with the disease are locals and 2 were hospitalised but have been discharged.
