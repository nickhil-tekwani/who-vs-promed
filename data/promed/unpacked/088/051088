New cholera strain emerges
---------------------------------------
A cholera outbreak, which has so far this year claimed dozens of lives
countrywide, threatens to intensify in the capital due to a breakdown of
council facilities and heavy rains, investigations by the Zimbabwe
Independent revealed this week.
This comes against a background of unconfirmed reports of a new strain of
cholera that can kill within hours.
An independent medical expert said while the problem of cholera was real,
they had not independently isolated the more lethal strain of cholera in
Harare. "This may have been done at the municipality's laboratories at the
Beatrice Infectious Diseases Hospital," he said.
Andrew Ruwende, a World Health Organisation official attached to the
Ministry of Health's epidemiology and disease control (EDC) department,
said he had not yet been informed about the new cholera strain by city
health officials. "The two strains that I know of in Harare are _Vibrio
cholerae_ [serotype Inaba and _Vibrio cholerae_ [serotype Ogawa."
Health Minister Timothy Stamps said yesterday the relatively low number of
recorded deaths from the epidemic downplayed the severity of the problem in
the capital."
Information obtained from the EDC head office indicates that 178 clinical
cholera cases were handled in Harare from the beginning of the year until
19 March 1999. There were two institutional deaths and no community deaths
from the epidemic, the EDC said in its latest report on the scourge, noting
that there was a steady increase in the number of cholera cases being
reported in the capital.
