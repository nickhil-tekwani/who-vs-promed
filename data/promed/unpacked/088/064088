Hunt launched for toxic vodka
-----------------------
Vodka laced with poisonous methanol may be on sale in shops in Suffolk.
Trading Standards officers are on the hunt for bottles branded S
Petersbourg and St. Petersburg; any found will be withdrawn from sale.
Bottles have already been found in the Waltham Forest area of East London
containing dangerously high levels of methanol, which can lead to abdominal
pain, breathing problems, and even coma if swallowed [ingested].
The bottles have the following markings:
S Petersbourg Vodka -
A white front label with: S Petersbourg in black lettering and Vodka in red
lettering 70cl,e, 37.5 percent Vol.
Gold crown with cross swords and 2 red lions at the top, and a gold image
of buildings at the bottom.
A white back label with: S Petersbourg in black lettering and Vodka in red
'Produced and bottled by cod.ACCISA GE A0002A - NE (GE)' '70cl,e, 37.5
percent and the bar code 8003151000006.'
The bottles found so far also bear the lot code L601-02.
St. Petersburg Vodka bottles have been found in 1-litre bottles and have
identical labelling except for being 1LTR volume instead of 70cl, and have
a different spelling on the label.
Anyone who thinks they may have bought a bottle matching either of these
descriptions should contact the Trading Standards Advice Line on 01473 584358.
The symptoms can be delayed for several hours, so anyone who thinks they
have drunk any of this contaminated vodka is advised to see their doctor as
a priority.

[Methanol (wood alcohol) is produced from the destructive distillation of
wood. Epidemics of methanol toxicity have resulted from the consumption of
methanol-contaminated whiskey. The formation of 2 toxic metabolites,
formaldehyde and formic acid, causes methanol poisoning. The elimination
rate depends upon the folate pool, which in primates is generally small,
and consequently primates (including humans) are more sensitive to methanol
toxicity than other animals.
Methanol is widely available in formulations including antifreeze,
windshield washer fluid, Sterno canned heat, shellacs, various paints,
paint removers, varnishes, duplicating fluids, and gasoline additives.
Fatalities have been reported after ingestion of 15 ml or 3 teaspoons of a
40 percent solution, although 30 ml is generally considered a minimal
lethal dose. With aggressive medical care it is possible to survive the
ingestion of 500-600 ml. However, consumption of as little as 10 ml may
cause blindness, with the amount varying with the individual.
Methanol is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and peak levels
occur generally within 30-90 minutes. It is distributed into tissues, so
concentrations in the vitreous humor and optic nerve are high. The highest
concentrations are found in the kidney, liver, and gastrointestinal tract,
with smaller concentrations in the brain, muscle, and adipose tissues.
Methanol is oxidized 10 times more slowly than ethanol. Consequently there
is a longer elimination half-life.
Onset of symptoms varies between 40 minutes and 72 hours post-ingestion.
Co-ingestion with alcohol will delay the appearance of symptoms, but the
absence of symptoms does not exclude serious toxicity. The usual latent
period is 12-24 hours.
Clinical signs may include headache, vertigo, lethargy, and confusion,
which are common in mild-to-moderate ethanol intoxications. Coma and
convulsions appear in severe cases, probably as a result of cerebral edema.
Methanol produces little to no euphoria, unlike ethanol.
Blurred vision, decreased visual acuity, and photophobia (sensitivity to
light) are common complaints. Constricted visual fields, fixed and dilated
pupils, retinal edema, and hyperemia of the optic disk are common clinical
findings. Prompt initial therapy is necessary to reverse symptoms, though
visual defects have persisted in up to 25 percent of severe cases. Methanol
is a mucosal irritant and may produce nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain,
not unlike large doses of ethanol.
Early in the clinical course, gut decontamination with ipecac or lavage may
be indicated. However, if the methanol is mixed with ethanol, these
patients may not realize something is out of the ordinary until it is too
late for this type of treatment to be helpful.
Intravenous administration of ethanol in a 10 percent dextrose solution may
be helpful. As ethanol prolongs the elimination half-life of methanol, the
treatment may take several days and the patient should be hospitalized.
Dialysis may be necessary to prevent kidney failure as well. - Mod.TG]
