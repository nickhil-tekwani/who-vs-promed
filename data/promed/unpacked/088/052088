RABBIT HEM. DIS. VIRUS, TRANSMISSION BY INSECTS

CSIRO professor, and research scientist, Brian Cook today told a congress
of the Australian & New Zealand Assoc for the Advancement of Sciences
(ANZAAS)
that rabbit calicivirus disease [caused by rabbit hemmorhagic disease
virus] has been transmitted thousands of miles by flies, mosquitoes and
fleas. According to the media report, Cook said that the insects become
infected themselves and are able to carry it to distant locations,
particularly in the spring and autumn when temperatures are between a high
of 24C and a low of
11C. Cook also said that the rabbit population has been reduced by as much
as 90 percent in some areas. The virus was released almost a year ago from
70 sites in Queensland, 40 in Victoria, 39 in New South Wales, 15 in
Western Australia and 11 in South Australia.

[The question remains as to whether there is active virus replication
(biological) in insects that are transmitting the virus or whether there is
mechanical transmission. There being no evidence to date that this or any
other calicivirus replicates in either arthropods or in cell cultures from
arthropods, this transmission likely is mechanical, although this report
indicates that "the insects become infected themselves". Mechanical
transmission generally presupposes high titer in the infected vertebrate
(else the arthropod would not be able to take up sufficient virus to
transmit it) and just the right environmental conditions to prevent virus
degradation on mouth parts, at least for a period of time sufficient to
allow secondary blood-feeding.
Any reason to believe that fleas move viruses thousands of miles? -- Mod CHC]
