Highly pathogenic avian influenza, Togo
---------------------------------------
General information
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 17 Aug 2021
Date of confirmation of the event: 24 Aug 2021
Reason for notification: recurrence
Last occurrence: 24 Mar 2019
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus
Serotype: H5N1
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory, necropsy
This event pertains to the whole country.

Outbreak location: Agodeka (Baguida township), Golfe (Lome), Maritime
Date of start of the outbreak: 17 Aug 2021
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Birds / 1880 / 1040 / 879 / 1001 / 0 / 0
Affected population: the farm is a laying hen and cockerel farm with 2 separate buildings approximately 50 m [164 ft] apart on 2 different plots of land belonging to the same owner. The farm is located in a conurbation, with the owner's family living in the plot where the disease started. This plot housed approximately 1000 layers (7 months old) at the start of the disease. At the time of the investigation, only 161 were still alive. The 2nd plot has a building that housed 650 cockerels and 190 pullets (3 months old). Signs of the disease were not observed in this building.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: the farm is located in a conurbation in plots where the owner's family lives. Biosecurity measures are almost non-existent. The owner's wife sells eggs from the farm to the market, a potential source of infection. Likely introduction of the virus by traders who come to buy eggs from the farm using their own trays which have been recycled several times. The poultry house is close to the Zio river valley, which is a biotope for birds.

Control measures at event level
Domestic control measures applied: surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; traceability; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; movement control inside the country; quarantine; official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste; official destruction of animal products; disinfection; stamping out
