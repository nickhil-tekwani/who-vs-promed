An increase in the number of hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) patients in the North Island has Bay of Plenty [North Island] health officials urging parents and daycare centres to enforce children's hygiene. In the last month Tauranga Hospital has treated around 20 children, aged between 2 and 5 years old, suffering from dehydration as a result of the contagious virus.

Bay of Plenty health officials say the easiest way to prevent hand-foot-mouth disease is hand washing and good clean personal hygiene. Media are also reporting Auckland Starship Hospital's emergency department has been treating up to 15 children each week for the last month.

The disease, a contagious virus based in the intestine, is not the same as the veterinary disease, foot-and-mouth disease, and is characterised by fluid-like blisters appearing on the hands, feet, and inside of the mouth. It is not considered serious but many children can become dehydrated as blisters make it painful to drink water. Bay of Plenty District Health Board paediatrician Doctor Hugh Lees says while it is contagious it is considered relatively mild. "We only see the children who are having difficulty with getting fluids. Most children will probably be being seen by a GP. "The most important measure to prevent the spread is "to wash your hands."

Health officials are advising children should only be sent home if they are feeling unwell, not because red spots are visible. HFMD most commonly affects children under the age of 10, particularly pre-schoolers with outbreaks often occurring in child-care centres and schools. The disease is transmitted from person to person by direct contact with the blisters fluid or direct contact from secretions from the child's nose or throat. Bay of Plenty Medical Officer of Health Doctor Phil Shoemack says with any contagious or viral disease it is important not to let personal hygiene slip. It just can't be over-emphasised the importance of good every good personal hygiene and one of the key things is hand washing.

[Hand-foot-mouth disease is caused by viruses that belong to the genus _Enterovirus_. This group of viruses includes polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and enteroviruses. Coxsackievirus A16 has been the most common cause of hand-foot-mouth disease in the United States, but other coxsackieviruses have been associated with the illness. Enterovirus 71 has also been associated with hand-foot-mouth disease and outbreaks of this disease. Since 1997, large outbreaks of HFMD caused by enterovirus 71 have been reported mostly in children in east and Southeast Asia. In these outbreaks, most children have typical symptoms of HFMD and recover without health complications. However, a small number of people with this disease develop severe complications requiring hospitalization or even causing death.

Currently regional HFMD activity in South and Southeast Asia is overall low following seasonal patterns. Case numbers can be found at the WHO website (http://www.wpro.who.int/emerging_diseases/HFMD/en/index.html. A large outbreak is occurring in Viet Nam currently, and travellers are being warned to can protect themselves by maintaining personal hygiene.

By comparison the current outbreak in New Zealand is so far a minor event. The identity of the enterovirus associated with the outbreak in New Zealand appears not to have been determined yet, therefore the severity of the outbreak cannot be predicted.
