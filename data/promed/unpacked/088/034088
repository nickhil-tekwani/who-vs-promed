Classical Swine Fever in South Africa after 87 years' absence
-------------------------------------------------------------
(Letter in Veterinary Record)
In June 2005 suspicion of Classical Swine Fever (CSF) gradually arose on a 250-
sow breeding unit in the Worcester district of the Western Cape Province of
South Africa
-- see map at: <http://www.places.co.za/maps/western_cape_map.html> --
after therapeutic interventions against _Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae_,
_Haemophilus parasuis_ and _Pasteurella multocida_ proved unsuccessful, and
diagnostic investigations for other viral diseases were negative.
The severity of the outbreak with high morbidity and mortality across all age
groups, clinical signs, pathology, and poor response to antibiotic treatment
indicated a highly pathogenic viral disease. Of a total of 2000 pigs, 200 had
died by 4 Jul 2005: deaths were initially among sows, but later also in other
age groups.
The clinical picture was initially similar to that observed in an outbreak of
PRRS (porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome) in the Western Cape a few
months earlier, and included anorexia, abortions, emaciation and general
weakness; but later also included conjunctivitis, skin hyperaemia and
cyanosis, diarrhoea or constipation, incoordination and posterior paresis.
Post-mortem findings showed moderate purple skin discoloration, serosal
petecchial haemorrhages, edematous and haemorrhagic lymph nodes, pneumonia,
and necrotic vasculitis with thrombosis. CSF was then suspected as the main
differential cause of the then undiagnosed disease.
Fresh tissue samples were submitted to the Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute
for African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV) diagnosis and CSF serology, to the
Provincial Veterinary Laboratory at Stellenbosch, Western Cape for bovine
viral Diarrhoea virus (BVDV) diagnosis, and also to the OIE CSF Reference
Laboratory at the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (Weybridge), UK, and the EU
Reference Laboratory for CSF in Hannover, Germany, for CSF virus (CSFV)
isolation. The investigations for ASFV were negative, but antibodies to CSFV,
and BVDV antigen were detected by ELISA; the latter probably due to
serological cross-reactions. CSFV was detected by RT-PCR at both the Weybridge
and Hannover laboratories, and subsequently verified by virus isolation and
monoclonal antibody typing.
Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of 3 genomic regions showed the virus to
be of subtype 2.1. CSFV isolates from this genetic group have previously
caused several outbreaks of CSF in Europe but, unlike CSFV subtypes 2.2 and
2.3, have never become enzootic in European wild boar. CSFV subtype 2.1 has
never been found in the Americas, and appears to be confined to Asia. CSF was
eradicated from South Africa in 1918, and since then animal import
restrictions and a general ban on vaccination against diseases exotic to South
Africa together with regular serological surveys have verified absence of
CSF. Epidemiological investigations are continuing to establish the likely
source of the infection.
Stamping out and disinfection of the affected farm and all possible contact
farms were immediately implemented. An extensive serological survey is being
conducted in the enclosed Hex River Valley within the Worcester district where
the disease was diagnosed. The findings of the survey, clinical and laboratory
diagnosis and control measures that were applied will be reported on in detail
in a subsequent publication in The Veterinary Record.

[This case illuminates convincingly the utmost importance of vigilance and
preparedness for the early detection, identification and consequent timely
control of exotic animal diseases, especially when they appear for the first
time outside their traditional geographical boundaries. It also indicates the
importance of reference laboratories capable of applying state-of-the-art,
sophisticated diagnostic tools.
Such events have occurred before, some leading to devastating losses. South
Africa had a painful lesson in 1951, when Rift valley fever, previously
unknown there, had its 6-month-long unhindered course throughout vast areas,
infecting numerous animals and humans before being identified.
The South Africans and their British and German counterparts should be
congratulated for their achievement; others should draw the applicable
conclusions from this lesson. - Mod.AS].
