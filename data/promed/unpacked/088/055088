5 samples have been tested positive for _Salmonella [enterica_ serovar]
paratyphi B during the scheduled examination among the workers of the
confectionary factory. All of them have been referred to the infectious
diseases hospital for further follow up. After the detailed clinical and
laboratory examination, paratyphoid B has been confirmed in 2 cases and
carriage in 3 cases.

[Typhoid and paratyphoid diseases are dangerous among the workers of food
producing and processing factories and can lead to huge outbreaks. Several
historic and contemporary foodborne outbreaks have been described, like the
"typhoid Mary" case in New York in the beginning of 20th century and
military academy case in Saint Petersburg in 2006. It can be said that
Armenian specialists prevented a potential outbreak. - Corr.AS
Paratyphoid fever is similar to typhoid fever, in that both are enteric
fever types of disease, although the former is generally less severe. The
paratyphoid salmonellas are divided into A, B, and rarely now C.
_Salmonella Paratyphi_, formerly referred to as _S. enterica_ serotype
Paratyphi. Types B and C also have species -- now serotypes --
_schottmuelleri_ and _hirschfeldii_, respectively. Like typhoid,
paratyphoid is generally considered not to be a zoonosis with humans as the
reservoir, but the paratyphoid bacillus has been isolated from domestic
animals and fish.
In India, paratyphoid A has become an increasing problem, accounting for up
to 45 percent of cases of enteric fever in 1998 (1). Although initially
quite sensitive to antimicrobials, strains have become more resistant to
quinolones; in contrast, _S. typhi_ has manifested resistance for some time.
In a recent report regarding differential risk factors for typhoid and
paratyphoid in Indonesia, the authors found that the infections seemed to
have distinct routes of transmission (2). Typhoid was associated with
factors within a household (recent case in the house, no soap for
handwashing, sharing of food from the same plate, no toilet in the house),
whereas paratyphoid was associated with sources outside the household such
as food from street vendors and flooding.
