Smallpox Vaccine Adverse Events Among Civilians --- United States, 25
Feb - 3 Mar 2003
-----------------------------
During the civilian smallpox vaccination program, CDC, the Food and
Drug Administration, and state health departments are conducting
surveillance for vaccine-associated adverse events. In the first
stage of the program, active surveillance is being conducted for
potentially life-threatening, moderate-to-severe, and other serious
adverse events and for vaccinia transmission to contacts of vaccinees
(1).
Nonserious events are reported through passive surveillance and are
expected to be underreported. This report summarizes smallpox vaccine
adverse events reported among civilians vaccinated as of 28 Feb 2003,
and among contacts of vaccinees, received by CDC from the Vaccine
Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) as of 3 Mar 2003.
Potentially life-threatening and moderate-to-serious events are
classified on the basis of evidence in support of the reported
diagnoses. For probable cases, other causes are excluded, and
supportive information is available. Events are classified as
suspected if they have clinical features compatible with the
diagnosis, but either further investigation is required or additional
investigation of the case did not provide supporting evidence for the
diagnosis and did not identify an alternative diagnosis. CDC and
state and local health departments also receive reports of other
events that are associated temporally with smallpox vaccination.
Reported adverse events are not necessarily associated with
vaccination, and some or all of these events might be coincidental.
During 24 Jan - 28 Feb 2003 smallpox vaccine was administered to 12
690 civilian health-care and public health workers in 45
jurisdictions. No potentially life-threatening adverse events of a
type known previously to be caused by smallpox vaccination have been
reported as of 3 Mar 2003.
2 moderate-to-severe adverse events were reported. Both were probable
cases of ocular vaccinia, and both were traced to contact with
military personnel who received smallpox vaccine.
A woman aged 26 years slept in the same bed several times a week over
a 3-week period with a military vaccinee beginning shortly after he
received smallpox vaccine; he was reported often not to have kept his
vaccination site covered. The woman became ill with swelling, pain,
and discharge from the right eye, which progressed over the course of
1 week to swelling of the entire right side of the face, difficulty
opening and impaired vision in the right eye, and increased exudate,
despite treatment with antibacterial eyedrops. On 22 Feb 2003, she
was hospitalized. Ophthalmologic examination revealed severe right
scleral injection and chemosis, a small pustule at the right
palpebral lower lid margin, and tender right preauricular and
submandibular adenopathy but found no evidence of keratitis, iritis,
or periocular lesions. Orbital computerized tomography scan was
consistent with preseptal cellulitis without infection of the globe.
The patient's preseptal cellulitis improved within 24 hours after
treatment with intravenous antibiotics, and she was discharged on 25
Feb 2003. The following day, the patient was readmitted with
persistent right blepharoconjunctivitis. Preliminary viral cultures
of conjunctival fluid revealed cytopathic effect consistent with
viral infection, and a direct fluorescent antibody test was positive
for vaccinia. The patient improved within 24 hours after treatment
with trifluridine eyedrops and a single dose of intravenous vaccinia
immune globulin. She was discharged on 28 Feb 2003. The viral culture
material and a swab sample from the patient's eye were sent to CDC
and tested positive for vaccinia DNA by real-time polymerase chain
reaction (PCR).
On 14 Feb 2003, a woman aged 18 years with no history of smallpox
vaccination handled the bandage of a military vaccinee. The woman had
a pustular skin lesion (size: 1.5 cm) with a small satellite lesion
on her right forearm 3 days after this contact and a second pustular
lesion on the back of her upper right arm 5 days after contact,
followed by irritation and swelling in her right eye 8 days after
contact. The patient first sought medical attention 11 days after the
contact and had a skin condition and bacterial conjunctivitis
diagnosed, which were treated with an oral antibiotic; 14 days after
contact, she was noted to have 2 small pustular lesions on her right
eyelid and had blepharoconjunctivitis diagnosed. She had marked
improvement within 24 hours after initiating treatment with
trifluridine eye drops. Specimens taken from eye and skin lesions
demonstrated vaccinia virus based on PCR.
3 other serious adverse events were reported. One case involved
headache and dizziness; although headache has been reported after
smallpox vaccination, the casual role of smallpox vaccine in this
case is unknown. The other 2 events (cholecystitis and hypertension)
are not known to be associated causally with smallpox vaccination.
A woman aged 38 years had headache and dizziness 5 days after
smallpox vaccination; 6 days later, after the symptoms had increased
in intensity, she was admitted to a hospital for evaluation. A
neurologist observed no change in mental status or other neurologic
deficits; an MRI brain scan showed no abnormalities. The patient's
symptoms improved, and she was discharged 2 days later.
A man aged 46 years with a history of hypertension was hospitalized 1
day after vaccination with hypertension (blood pressure:
approximately 230/120) and severe headache. The patient was treated
with antihypertensive medications and was discharged after 1 day.
A woman aged 51 years had onset of chest discomfort, shortness of
breath, and nausea 2 days after vaccination. The patient had
cholelithiasis with ductal blockage diagnosed and had a
cholecystectomy; she was discharged after 3 days.
Among the 46 vaccinees with reported other nonserious adverse events
during 24 Jan-- 3 Mar 2003 [see table on
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5209a4.htm>], the most
common signs and symptoms were fever (n = 11), pruritus (n = 11),
rash (n = 10), and pain (n = 7). All of these commonly reported
events are consistent with mild expected reactions following receipt
of smallpox vaccine. Some vaccinees reported multiple signs and
symptoms.
Surveillance for adverse events during the civilian smallpox
vaccination program is ongoing; regular surveillance reports will be
published in MMWR.
Reported by: Smallpox Vaccine Adverse Events coordinators. National
Center for Infectious Diseases; National Immunization Program, CDC.
[MMWR] Editorial Note:
This report highlights the importance of proper vaccination site care
in preventing contact transmission of vaccinia virus and the need for
vaccinees and unvaccinated persons who have contact with vaccinees to
protect against contact transmission (2). Vaccinees who do not work
in health-care settings should cover the vaccination site with a
gauze bandage that is secured by first-aid adhesive tape and should
change the bandage frequently (i.e., every 1--3 days). Vaccinees
should keep the vaccination site dry, cover it with a waterproof
bandage during bathing, and change back to a gauze bandage after
bathing. Gauze bandages should be changed whenever they become wet.
As an added precaution, vaccinees should wear a long-sleeved shirt
that covers the vaccination site, particularly in situations
involving close physical contact. Vaccinees should practice
consistent hand hygiene by washing thoroughly with antimicrobial soap
and water or with an approved alcohol-based hand-rub (i.e., one that
contains >60 percent alcohol) after any contact with the vaccination
site or with materials that have come into contact with the site,
including bandages, clothing, towels, and sheets. Contaminated
bandages and scabs from the vaccination site should be placed in a
sealed plastic bag and discarded. Vaccinees should keep a separate
laundry hamper for clothing, towels, sheets, and other items that
might have come in direct contact with the vaccination site or with
drainage from the site; these items should be washed by using hot
water with detergent and/or bleach.
Contacts of vaccinees should not touch the vaccine site or any
materials that might be contaminated with vaccine virus, including
bandages, clothing, towels, or sheets. Contacts who touch any
potentially contaminated materials inadvertently should wash their
hands immediately. Vaccinated persons and their contacts who share a
bed should be certain that the vaccination site is covered with a
bandage and shirt sleeve.
