"New" grain disease proves hard to spot
---------------------------------------
A grain disease new to Scotland has appeared this summer [2010] and farmers
are being asked to stay on the alert as it is easy to confuse with the
standard fare of disease problems in crops there.

SAC's [Scottish Agricultural College] experts are investigating a rash of
these unusual leaf spots in wheat and barley crops. An outbreak of tan
spot, caused by the fungus _Pyrenophora tritici-repentis_ has occurred in
the Lothians. This disease is a common problem in Denmark and France, but
it has not been recognised as a major threat to Scottish wheat crops until now.

"We have experienced a cold winter and a warmer than average summer, with
plenty of showers," said Simon Oxley, SAC. "These conditions mirror those
typical in Denmark, where, since 2000, the disease has become a common
problem. There it is linked to minimum tillage, cultivation systems with
continuous wheat, or short rotations. We know that tan spot can attack both
wheat and barley, but further investigation of the barley leaf spots is
being done."

SAC's field teams noticed the new arrival during routine checks of trial
sites. The SAC research into disease patterns and behaviour means the crops
are still under detailed scrutiny. "It's too late now for any treatment,"
said Dr Oxley. "However, it will help us get an idea of the level of
disease in Scotland this year [2010] and form any advice we might give next
season. This certainly proves the worth of our surveillance work."

[Tan spot (also called yellow leaf spot or blotch) is caused by the fungus
_Pyrenophora tritici-repentis_. It affects wheat but can also attack
barley, triticale, rye, and some grasses. Tan spot may cause yield losses
of up to 50 per cent in favourable environments, especially under minimum
tillage systems. Symptoms include characteristic tan leaf lesions with dark
centre and yellow surrounds, which may merge to form large necrotic areas;
discolouration of glumes and seeds leading to downgrading of grain; and
short, spindly plants with reduced tillering and root development. Plants
may be fully defoliated soon after flowering. Symptoms are generally seen
later in the season in the middle and upper canopy, but young plantlets
from infected seed can show leaf spots.

The pathogen survives mainly as dormant mycelium on stubble and crop
debris. Wet conditions are necessary for spore production and infection of
growing plants resulting in rapid development of the epidemic within a
crop. Long distance spread to other crops and areas may occur by strong
winds, with infected seed or other plant material. Disease management
includes cultural measures (removal of stubble by ploughing or burning),
crop rotation, and fungicides as seed treatments and foliar applications.
Host field resistance is poorly understood and many commercial wheat
cultivars are susceptible.
