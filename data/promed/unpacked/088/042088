The Snow Brand Milk Products Co. admitted Saturday afternoon that
_Staphylococcus_ was detected at its Osaka plant and that it may have
caused a food-poisoning outbreak that sickened more than 6000 people in
eight prefectures who fell ill after drinking low-fat milk processed at the
plant.
An official of the dairy giant told reporters at a press conference in
Osaka that the [bacterium was detected around a valve inside a spare tank
where a skim milk mixture and other materials are stored for the following
day's operation. The valve is linked to other tanks that mix raw materials
in the milk-production process. The valve is supposed to be dismantled once
a week for cleaning and sterilization, but apparently had not been cleaned
for much longer, according to the official.
Snow Brand has conducted regular checks on the valve for colon bacilli, but
not _Staphylococcus_, contamination.
Since _Staphylococcus_ was detected inside the valve and part of a pipe
connected to another facility, the company suspects they were not cleaned
often enough.
The number of people complaining of vomiting and diarrhea after drinking
low-fat milk processed at the Snow Brand plant in Miyakojima Ward, Osaka,
reached a total of 6121 as of 8 p.m. Saturday in Osaka, Kyoto, Hyogo, Nara,
Wakayama, Shiga, Okayama and Hiroshima prefectures. One hundred have been
hospitalized.
The firm has recalled 298 000 cartons of low-fat milk produced at the Osaka
plant since Friday. The suspect milk is stamped with expiration dates from
June 30 to July 2.
Snow Brand has examined 7 kinds of milk samples kept at the plant and by a
victim in Wakayama Prefecture.
However, none of 9 kinds of [bacteria that cause food poisoning, including
_Staphylococcus_ and colon bacilli, was found in the samples, according to
the firm.
