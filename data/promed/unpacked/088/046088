The measles epidemic that started in Greece over 6 months ago is showing no sign of abating, with the Center for Disease Prevention and Control (KEELPNO) reporting 80 cases last week alone, bringing the total between May and November 2017 to 604.

Moreover, November 2017 was the month with the highest number of reported cases (236). Most cases so far have been recorded in southern Greece, but KEELPNO said other areas may also be affected. "Spread to other areas cannot be ruled out," it said.

The disease has struck people who have not been vaccinated at all or not properly immunized.

The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control has listed Greece as one of 4 countries that have been impacted the most by the disease.

In a follow-up on the measles outbreaks reported in the cities of Leeds, Liverpool and Birmingham, Public Health England (PHE) reports that the outbreaks are linked to travel to other areas of Europe and advises the public to ensure that vaccinations are up to date prior to traveling this Christmas season [2017].

As of 29 Nov 2017, there were 16 confirmed cases in Leeds, 11 confirmed cases in Liverpool, and 9 confirmed cases in Birmingham. All of the cases have been reported in children and adults who have not received 2 doses of the MMR vaccine.

Children and young people who have not received 2 doses of MMR vaccine are at risk. Unvaccinated people travelling to Romania and Italy, where there are currently large outbreaks of measles, are at particularly high risk. Anyone planning to travel to Europe over the Christmas period should check NaTHNaC travel health advice.

PHE local health protection teams are working closely with the NHS and local authorities to raise awareness of the outbreaks in England and Europe with health professionals and local communities.

The MMR vaccine is available to all adults and children who are not up to date with their 2 doses. Anyone who is not sure whether they are fully vaccinated should check with their GP practice.

Dr. Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisation at PHE, said: "The measles outbreaks we are currently seeing in England are linked to ongoing large outbreaks in Europe. People who have recently travelled, or are planning to travel to Romania, Italy and Germany and have not had 2 doses of the MMR vaccine are particularly at risk. This serves as an important reminder for parents to take up the offer of MMR vaccination for their children at 1 year of age and as a pre-school booster at 3 years and 4 months of age. Children and young adults who missed out on their MMR vaccine in the past or are unsure if they had 2 doses should contact their GP practice to catch-up. We'd also encourage people to ensure they are up to date with their MMR vaccine before travelling to countries with ongoing measles outbreaks. The UK recently achieved WHO measles elimination status and so the overall risk of measles to the UK population is low, however due to ongoing measles outbreaks in Europe, we will continue to see cases in unimmunised individuals and limited onward spread can occur in communities with low MMR coverage and in age groups with very close mixing."

[The European measles outbreaks are linked to the combined effect of poor vaccination coverage and high numbers of people traveling. Alerts have been posted by Public Health England warning travelers the Christmas markets in Europe could spark a measles outbreak among those who are not fully immunized.

Summary of the situation Between October 2016 and September 2017:

Countries of the European Region reported 15 941 confirmed measles cases; 86% (n=13 712) of these cases were reported in 2017. In this period, the highest incidence was reported in Romania (252.4 cases per 1 million population), followed by Italy (82.4 cases per 1 million population) and Tajikistan (77.3 cases per 1 million population). In 2017, there were 20 measles deaths, including 10 reported in Romania. In 2017, in the European Region, measles was confirmed by laboratory testing (serology, virus detection, or isolation) in 56% (7725) of these cases, and the others were classified as epidemiologically linked or clinically compatible. The identified genotypes were D8 (n=405), B3 (n=547), H1 (n=22), and D9 (n=1).

Countries in other continents (China, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Mongolia, Nigeria, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Thailand, and Viet Nam, among others) have also reported measles outbreaks between 2016 and 2017.

Region of the Americas: Between epidemiological week (EW) 1 and EW 46 of 2017, a total of 600 confirmed measles cases were reported in 4 countries of the Region of the Americas: Argentina (3 cases), Canada (46 cases), the United States of America (120 cases), and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (431 cases). Of the cases reported in Argentina, Canada, and the Unites States of America, 36% were in children between 1 and 4 years of age; 60% of the cases had no vaccination history against measles and rubella. In Venezuela, between EW 36 and EW 47 of 2017, a total of 773 suspected measles cases were identified; of these 431 were confirmed (by laboratory or by epidemiological link), 188 were discarded, and 154 remain under investigation; no deaths were recorded. The majority of the cases come from Bolívar state. In Anzoátegui state, 2 confirmed cases were identified, both with an epidemiological link with Bolívar state. Epidemiological surveillance has not identified suspected cases in other federal entities related to this outbreak. Among the confirmed cases in the current outbreak in Bolívar state, the most affected age groups correspond to those under 1 year (incidence rate = 415 cases per 100 000 inhabitants), followed by those of 1 year of age (incidence rate = 248 cases per 100 000 inhabitants). Active search for cases and institutional vaccination activities in educational centers, house to house, and at designated locations, with indiscriminate vaccination with the triple viral vaccine (measles, mumps and rubella (MMR)) are being maintained at 6 months and 5 years of age with measles, rubella (MR) vaccine to the age group 6-10 years and selective vaccination with MR vaccine to contacts from 11-39 years of age.

A summary of the support activities of the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) to the Venezuela Ministry of the Popular Power for Health (MPPS) in the implementation of the response plan for the interruption of the measles outbreak and the control of diphtheria in Venezuela, is available (in Spanish) at the following link: https://sway.com/QMZ5v7quo1AianxU?ref=Link.

All cases confirmed in the Region of the Americas imported from other continents were related to importation or had unknown source of infection. The genotypes identified were D8 in Argentina, and B3 and D8 in Canada and the United States. In Venezuela, the identified genotype was D8 (with a different lineage to the D8 identified in Brazil in previous years). The Region of the Americas was the 1st to be declared by the International Expert Committee (IEC) free of rubella in 2015 and measles in 2016 (1,2). The main measure to prevent the introduction and dissemination of the measles virus is the vaccination of the susceptible population, together with the implementation of a surveillance system of high quality and sensitive enough to detect in a timely manner any suspected cases of measles or rubella.

Authorities in Brazoria County said a Sablatura Middle School student showed symptoms of a measles infection.

Authorities in Brazoria County are awaiting blood work to confirm whether or not a Pearland student has measles.

Health officials told Eyewitness News a student at Sablatura Middle School in Pearland was out of class for 4 days but is now back at school after experiencing symptoms of the infectious disease.

A male and female teacher and a sibling of the student who were possibly infected have been cleared by health officials.

While measles had been eliminated in the U.S. since 2000, large measles outbreaks have been reported in Western Europe, Pakistan, Viet Nam and the Philippines in recent years, officials said.

In 2014, 288 cases were reported in the United States. ...- more

[Generally, with treatment, it takes about 7-14 days for a child to recover following measles infection, and recovery may take longer in children who have a weakened immune system. Four days, cited above for the student to be back in school, seems a little brief.

Christmas shoppers in Melbourne have been urged to watch out for measles symptoms after a woman diagnosed with the disease spent time in the city while infectious.

The woman, suspected of picking up the illness overseas, went shopping in Brunswick and the CBD while infectious on Wed and Thu [29 and 30 Nov 2017], Victoria's deputy chief health officer Dr Brett Sutton said.

It's the 12th measles case confirmed in Melbourne in recent months, and people who visit areas where the woman shopped may be at risk of contracting measles, with symptoms possible to emerge until 18 Dec 2017.
