A life-threatening flu bug with symptoms similar to those of the deadly
H1N1 virus [that is, the 2009 pandemic A (H1N1) influenza virus] has hit
all of the country's 10 provinces, affecting thousands of people.
Confirming the outbreak last week, Dr Portia Manangazira of the
Epidemiology and Disease Control Unit in the Ministry of Health and Child
Welfare said the flu [outbreak] might be a combination of H1N1 (swine flu)
and H3N2 (common cold flu) [i.e. seasonal influenza]. "There is a spread of
a combination of H1N1 and H3N2 countrywide, but cases of common cold flu
[seasonal influenza] are usually reported between May and September," she
said. She urged all those who show signs and symptoms of cold to seek
medication as soon as possible, as common cold [seasonal] flu can also be
deadly. "Those who show signs related to swine or common cold [seasonal]
flu should seek immediate medication, as the vaccine [medication?] can be
accessed countrywide," said Dr Manangazira [Vaccine does not protect after
symptoms have developed. - Mod.CP].

"We do not have laboratory samples, and we base our surveys on signs and
symptoms to give medication. We are still using the same drug oseltamivir,
which treats both swine and [seasonal] flu to treat this bug," she said.
The symptoms of the flu bug are runny nose, sneezing, sore throat which may
lead to loss of voice, reddening of the eyes, general body ache, loss of
appetite and headaches.

Meanwhile, a suspected outbreak of the deadly H1N1 influenza virus has been
detected in Tsholotsho district [Matabeleland North province] where a total
of 300 people -- mostly school-children -- have been affected. According to
officials, 2 of the 7 preliminary tests carried out at Tsholotsho District
Hospital on Friday [15 Oct 2010] have come out positive. In a telephone
interview on Friday, the district administrator for Tsholotsho District, Mr
Themba Moyo, who is also the chairperson of the District Civil Protection
Unit, said the suspected cases have been recorded in 8 wards in the
district. The affected areas include Mbamba, Malanda, Tshitawatsha,
Dlamini, Bemba, Magama School, Nhembe and Makhazi. "Yes, we have recorded
about 300 cases of the suspected virus [2009 A/(H1N1) influenza virus] in
about 8 wards so far. Most of the cases are schoolchildren. So far, the
hospital has carried out tests on 7 of these, and the preliminary findings
point towards a possible outbreak of the H1N1 influenza virus, as 2 have so
far come out positive," said Mr Moyo.

Mr Moyo said the district was appealing for assistance to contain the
outbreak. He said the district required vehicles, fuel, oxygen tanks among
other things. "We are appealing to non-governmental organisations to come
forward and assist in containing this outbreak. As a matter of urgency, we
require 2 vehicles, about 600 litres of fuel, oxygen tanks, NS fluids,"
said Mr Moyo. By midday yesterday [16 Oct 2010], NGOs had already
dispatched teams to the affected areas. The NGO's Plan International and
Medecins Sans Frontiers had already reached some of the affected areas.

Efforts to get a comment from the provincial administrator, Ms Latitso
Dlamini, were fruitless, as her mobile phone went unanswered. Dr
Manangazira, confirmed that they have received reports of the outbreak and
had already dispatched surveillance teams to the affected areas. "We are in
receipt of reports of a possible outbreak of swine flu. At the moment, the
department has dispatched teams to investigate the outbreak. We want to
take samples for testing," said Dr Manangazira. She said the outbreak
appears to be localised and expressed confidence that the teams will be
able to contain the outbreak.

Dr Manangazira said her department was yet to ascertain whether the
affected areas had been covered by the national programme of immunisation
against the virus, adding that the programme had in the period covering
July and August this year [2010] reached over a million people.

The disease control officer for Matabeleland North, Dr Efison Dlodlo, also
confirmed the outbreak. "We had 2 cases involving schoolchildren from
Magama School, who tested positive for influenza Type A. This is not swine
flu as yet, so we are in the process of carrying out further tests on those
samples to verify whether or not we have an outbreak of swine flu. He said
the teams investigating the outbreak were also giving out the
anti-influenza drug Tamiflu in those affected areas. He said the Ministry
of Health had adequate stocks of the drug.

According to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in
humans the symptoms of the 2009 "swine flu" (H1N1 virus) are similar to
those of influenza and of influenza-like illness in general. The 2009
outbreak has shown an increased percentage of patients reporting diarrhoea
and vomiting.

Last year [2009], the country was on high alert following a few recorded
cases of people who had contracted the virus outside Zimbabwe. The 1st case
was of an unidentified man who flew into the country from London, and the
2nd case was of a schoolboy who had gone to South Africa for a sports
tournament. These cases prompted a heightened medical alert countrywide for
swine flu, which was declared a global pandemic by the World Health
Organization (WHO).

[It is clear from this report that there is currently an outbreak of
influenza in all 10 provinces of Zimbabwe, in some situations (in
Tsholotsho district of Matabeleland North province) mainly affecting
children. However, in the absence of confirmatory laboratory diagnoses, the
identity of the influenza viruses involved is uncertain. The 2009 pandemic
(H1N1) virus and seasonal influenza A (H3N2) virus are suspected. However,
according to the WHO Global Surveillance Network, as of 26 Sep 2010, in
Africa influenza B viruses have been the most common (44 per cent) ,
followed by influenza A (H3) (31 per cent); see ProMED-mail archived
report: Influenza (07): USA & worldwide 20101007.3643. Precise information
is awaited.
