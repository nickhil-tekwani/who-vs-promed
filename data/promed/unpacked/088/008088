West Nile fever data, 2018
--------------------------
In the 2018 transmission season a higher number of cases were reported compared with transmission seasons in previous years. The total number of reported autochthonous infections in 2018 (n= 2 083) exceeds, by far, the total number from the previous 7 years (n= 1 832).Compared to the previous transmission season in 2017, there was a 7.2-fold increase. The highest increase compared to the previous transmission season was observed in Bulgaria (15-fold) followed by France (13.5-fold) and Italy (10.9).

Human cases
-----------
In the 2018 transmission season a higher number of cases were reported compared with transmission seasons in previous years. As of 13 December 2018, 1503 human cases were reported in the EU/EEA by Italy (576), Greece (311), Romania (277), Hungary (215), Croatia (53), France (27), Austria (20), Bulgaria (15), the Czech Republic (5), Slovenia (3) and Cyprus (1). In the EU neighbouring countries 580 human cases were reported by Serbia (415), Israel (128), Turkey (23) and Kosovo* (14). Hundred-eighty deaths due to West Nile virus infection have been reported by Greece (47), Italy (46), Romania (43), Serbia (35), Kosovo* (3), Turkey (3), Bulgaria (2), the Czech Republic (1), and Hungary (1).

In 2018, the 1st cases in the European Union (EU) were notified by Greece in week 26 (25 Jun to 1 Jul 2018), with the earliest disease onset on 31 May 2018 (week 22). In the EU neighbouring countries the 1st case was reported by Serbia with a date of onset from week 24 [11-17 Jun 2018].

The last case of this transmission season in the EU was reported by France at the end of November, with a date of onset from week 46 [12-18 Nov 2018]. This represents an unusually late date of onset since in past transmission seasons in the EU/EEA and EU neighbouring countries, the latest date of onset typically occurred between weeks 39 [24-30 Sep 2018] and 42 [15-21 Oct 2018]. The latest date of onset in the EU neighbouring countries this transmission season was reported by Turkey from week 39.

The total number of reported autochthonous infections in 2018 (n= 2 083) exceeds, by far, the total number from the previous 7 years (n= 1 832).Compared to the previous transmission season in 2017, there was a 7.2-fold increase. The highest increase compared to the previous transmission season was observed in Bulgaria (15-fold) followed by France (13.5-fold) and Italy (10.9). The case fatality ratio (CFR) among the symptomatic cases in 2018 has not exceeded the CFR of the previous two years (9% in 2018 compared with 11% in 2017 and 9% in 2016). The proportion of cases with West Nile neuroinvasive disease (WNND) among symptomatic cases is comparable to the previous 2 years (68% in 2018 compared with 73% in 2017 and 65% in 2016).

All mosquito-borne autochthonous human cases during the current transmission season were reported in previously affected countries. As in previous years, the virus spread to NUTS [Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics] 3 areas [small regions for specific diagnoses] where no human autochthonous cases had been reported before.

Equine cases
------------
During the 2018 transmission season, 285 West Nile fever outbreaks among equids were reported by EU Member States through the Animal Disease Notification System: 149 in Italy, 91 in Hungary, 15 in Greece, 13 in France, 9 in Spain, 2 in Austria, 2 in Romania, 2 in Germany, 1 in Slovenia, and 1 in Portugal. This is a 30% increase compared to number of outbreaks in 2017.

[2] Vector resistance

ref: Institut Pasteur. Insecticide resistance genes affect vector competence for West Nile virus. ScienceDaily. 2019.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In a context of overuse of insecticides, which leads to the selection of resistant mosquitoes, it is already known that this resistance to insecticides affects interactions between mosquitoes and the pathogens they transmit. Researchers from the Institut Pasteur (Paris) and its partners prove that mechanisms of insecticide resistance, observed in _Culex quinquefasciatus_ vector, impact the transmission of West Nile virus.

Over the last decades, arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) that affect human health such as dengue, chikungunya, Zika, or West Nile viruses have taken the center stage owing to epidemic outbreaks or even pandemics affecting the world. In the absence of vaccines and therapeutic treatments, the control of arboviruses relies mainly on the control of mosquito populations.

The consequences of the overuse of insecticides
-----------------------------------------------
The use of insecticides has long been the unique method to reduce mosquito densities and thus interrupt the transmission of arboviruses. However, the overuse of insecticides leads to the selection of mosquitoes with insecticide resistance genes. Insecticide resistance has been reported to affect interactions between mosquitoes and the pathogens they transmit.

"We provide the 1st evidence of the impact of 2 main mechanisms of insecticide resistance on arbovirus transmission," explains Anna-Bella Failloux, Head of the Arboviruses and Insect Vectors laboratory at the Institut Pasteur.

Vector competence to 2 arboviruses
----------------------------------
"Using experimental infections, we compared the vector competence of insecticide-resistant and -susceptible _Culex quinquefasciatus_ mosquitoes (target modification and overproduction of detoxification enzymes) to 2 arboviruses, Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) and West Nile Virus (WNV)." For RVFV, vector competence remains unchanged whether the mosquito is resistant or susceptible. However, resistant mosquitoes transmit better WNV than susceptible mosquitoes.

"Our results underscore the importance of understanding the effects of insecticide resistance on vector competence and require reconsidering vector control strategies by limiting the production of insecticide-resistant mosquitoes."

[3] Italy: Usutu virus detections
Date: Thu 17 Jan 2019

ref: Carletti F, Colavita F, Rovida F, et al. Expanding Usutu virus circulation in Italy: detection in the Lazio region, central Italy, 2017 to 2018. Euro Surveill. 2019; 24(3):pii=1800649
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Blood donation screening for West Nile virus (WNV) was mandatory in the Lazio region in 2017 and 2018 (June-November) according to the national surveillance plan. In these years, all 5 donations reactive in WNV nucleic acid amplification tests harboured instead Usutu virus (USUV). Clade 'Europe 2' was identified in four blood donations and a 2018 mosquito pool. The co-circulation of WNV and USUV in Lazio warrants increased laboratory support and awareness of possible virus misidentification.

Discussion
----------
USUV is a mosquito-borne flavivirus, member of the Japanese encephalitis virus group, with 6 distinct clades so far recognised [5]. Its natural life cycle involves mosquitos as vectors and birds as amplifying hosts. Humans and horses are dead-end hosts, as for WNV.

USUV was isolated in South Africa in 1959 and was first reported in Europe in 2001, causing mass mortality of Eurasian blackbird (_Turdus merula_); however, a retrospective study showed that it has been present in Italy at least since 1996 [6]. Subsequently, USUV spread to other countries, including Hungary (2003-2006), Switzerland (2006), Spain (2003-2006), Germany (2010), Czech Republic (2014), Belgium, France, and the Netherlands (2016), where the virus was detected or isolated from mosquitos, birds and bats.

"Usutu virus first identified in South Africa in 1959, is an emerging zoonotic arbovirus of concern because of its pathogenicity to humans and its similarity in ecology with other emerging arboviruses such as West Nile Virus. USUV is a flavivirus belonging to the Japanese encephalitis complex." (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usutu_virus)

"In 2009, the 1st human case of USUV infection in Europe was reported in Italy, followed by further human cases in Germany, Croatia , Austria , and France. Human cases are commonly characterized by mild symptoms including fever, rash, jaundice, headache, nuchal rigidity, hand tremor and hyperreflexia. However, at least in immunosuppressed patients USUV can cause a neuro-invasive infection, and it has recently been suspected to have caused idiopathic facial paralysis . In addition to that, USUV infections were also detected from blood donors and healthy forestry workers in Germany and Italy, suggesting that asymptomatic infections can occur among humans." (https://ij-healthgeographics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12942-018-0155-7)

The report above highlights the necessity to consider different approaches to detect the current and future areas under risk of VBDs (vector borne diseases), including Usutu virus. - Mod.UBA
