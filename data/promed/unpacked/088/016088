["HPAIV A(H5N1) is highly infectious for a number of bird species, including most species of domestic poultry. Unlike most other avian influenza viruses, this virus has also infected mammals, including cats, pigs, and tigers, and has shown to be able to transmit to humans. However, the virus remains poorly adapted to humans, and transmission from birds to humans is a rare event. Since the 1st detection of zoonotic transmission of HPAI A(H5N1), limited clusters of human cases have occurred, but no sustained human-to-human transmission has been observed but showed. Zoonotic transmission to humans from infected birds occurs either directly or through environmental contamination. Hence, almost all human infections have been related to close contact with infected or sick birds or their faecal products in domestic settings, e.g., in 'wet markets' in Asia or in backyard farming. The circulation of HPAI A(H5N1) in bird populations in different regions of the world has contributed to the emergence of different virus clades." - Mod.CRD
