DONKEY ENCEPHALITIS - SWEDEN: REQUEST FOR INFO
**********************************************
During the past four months, seven Swedish donkeys, in two separate holdings,
have died of, or been euthanized because of, a severe CNS disorder. All
affected donkeys have more or less had the same case history of fluctuating
fever, loss of appetite, CNS symptoms including staggering gait and falling,
apprehension, and ulcers in the oral cavity. Also the post-mortem findings
have been consistent, showing non-purulent encephalitis and gastric ulcers.
The only time the diseased donkeys from the two holdings had contact [with
each other] was in August 1996 at a donkey-rally arranged by one of the
holdings. A number of other donkeys, also attending this meeting, have (so
far) not shown any signs of disease.
HI and CF tests for eastern equine, Venezuelan equine and western equine
encephalomyelitis [viruses] have shown titers (and in one case
seroconversion), but they were all NEGATIVE in serum neutralization tests.
Tests for Borna disease virus, tick-borne encephalitis and equine
herpesviruses -1 and -4 have all proved NEGATIVE. Virus isolation attempts
have so far been unsuccessful. Mouse inoculations are in progress.
If you have any suggestions as to the cause, please contact us.

[Of course, Dr. Elvander does not say where the donkeys are or where they
became sick, but I am assuming that would be Sweden. In that case, I doubt
the seropositivity with eastern equine encephalitis, western equine
encephalitis, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses; these viruses do
not occur outside the Americas, except in freezers. The nonspecificity of
those HI and CF tests likely are the reason the neutralization test was
negative. How about asking Bo Niklasson to test the samples for antibody to
Ockelbo, a western equine encephalitis complex alphavirus that does occur in
Sweden? -- Mod CHC]
