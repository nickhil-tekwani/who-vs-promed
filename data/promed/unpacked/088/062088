Two people with Legionnaires' disease have died at a Manhattan nursing home after _Legionella_, a bacterium that causes the disease, was discovered at the facility, according to the New York State Department of Health. It was not clear if Legionnaires' was the primary cause of their death, a spokesman for the department said.

The state has investigated a total of 8 possible cases of Legionnaires' disease associated with the Amsterdam Nursing Home, in Morningside Heights, between June and the beginning of September [2022], the Health Department spokesman said. Four of the 8 people have died, including the 2 who were confirmed to have had the disease, he said. A 3rd, nonfatal case was also confirmed as positive for Legionnaires' disease. The other 5 cases involved people who had preliminary evidence of the disease. The ages of the 8 nursing home residents ranged from 69 to 93, according to a spokesman for the nursing home.

The source of the infections in the building has not been determined, according to the state and the spokesman for the nursing home, but water restrictions have been placed on the facility's west wing, where the people with suspected cases lived. "Amsterdam Nursing is working closely to help in any way we can to clear up this matter," said Jeff Jacomowitz, the spokesman for the nursing home, on Tuesday [13 Sep 2022].

The bacteria can cause Legionnaires' disease and Pontiac fever, which is milder, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Legionnaires' disease can be fatal in about 10% of cases, according to the CDC.

People can be infected when they breathe in a mist or vapor that contains the bacteria, which might come from a building's cooling towers, or showers and hot tubs, according to the city Health Department. The disease is seldom spread from person to person.

Cases of Legionnaires' disease rose by an average of nearly 12% per year between 2007 and 2018 in New York, according to city data. Most people who are exposed to _Legionella_ bacteria do not become infected. But among people who do, those who are at high risk of becoming sick include people who are 50 years or older, those with weakened immune systems and those with chronic diseases like lung disease. In the city, infection rates are highest among older, Black and low-income people, who are more likely to live in poorly maintained housing. _Legionella_ thrives in warmer conditions, meaning the risks are likely to increase as the climate heats up.

The nursing home has installed "hospital grade" filters on faucets and shower heads in the building, Mr. Jacomowitz said. In addition, the facility is providing bottled water for drinking and washing, he said.

According to the city Health Department, people can't get Legionnaires' disease by drinking water that contains the bacteria. [The exception is people who tend to aspirate. - Mod.ML] Those using that water for cooking or for making hot drinks should start with cold water, the agency suggests.

Since 2015, New York State has required cooling towers on buildings to be registered, regularly inspected and tested for _Legionella_.

Amsterdam Nursing Home has been cited twice for violations since 2017, out of 5 cooling tower system inspections there, according to city data. A 2017 violation was for a new cooling tower that was not adequately cleaned or disinfected before being used, and a 2nd violation was for failing to collect and analyze a _Legionella_ sample in March 2021. The most recent inspection in October 2021 showed no violations. Samples tested from the facility in January and June of this year [2022] showed no detectable bacteria, said the state Health Department spokesman. Amsterdam Nursing Home was in full compliance with city health department rules in 2021, Mr. Jacomowitz said.

[Morningside Heights is a neighborhood on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in New York City, bounded by Morningside Drive/Morningside Park to the east, 125th Street to the north, 110th Street to the south. A large portion of Morningside Heights is part of the campus of Columbia University, in addition to the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, Riverside Church, St. Luke's Hospital (now Mount Sinai Morningside), and Grant's Tomb. A map showing the location of Morningside Heights can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Morningside+Heights,+New+York,+NY.

_Legionella_ are gram-negative bacilli that are found in both natural freshwater environments, such as lakes and streams, and in manufactured plumbing systems, such as showerheads and sink faucets, cooling towers, decorative fountains, hot tubs/spas, and hot-water tanks and heaters. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 deg C [77-104 deg F] support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems.

Eradication of these bacteria from plumbing systems is often difficult. Long-term persistence within these water systems is favored by the intracellular location of _Legionella_ within several species of protozoa, where _Legionella_ replicate and which provide protection from environmental stressors, like biocides and heat treatment.

Also, the formation of biofilms allows adherence of _Legionella_ to the inner surfaces of the plumbing systems (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5835138/). _Legionella pneumophila_ have been shown to persist for long periods in biofilms in a viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state after exposure to a biocide or heat treatment (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515819/). Monitoring _L. pneumophila_ in water systems, which is usually done by culture, would miss VBNC _Legionella_, which can be revived by the subsequent addition of amoeba (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18839249).

Debilitated hospitalized patients who are prone to aspiration may develop Legionnaires' disease following aspiration of _Legionella_-contaminated potable water as well as inhaling a fine spray (aerosols) from water sources containing _Legionella_. Possible person-to-person transmission has also been described (Correia AM, Goncalves J, Gomes JP, et al: Probable person-to-person transmission of Legionnaires' disease. N Engl J Med. 2016; 374(5): 497-8; http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356).

During the epidemiological and environmental investigation for the source of _Legionella_ organisms, patients should be prohibited from taking showers and should consume only sterile water until the source has been remediated.

Genotyping the clinical isolates from the cases of Legionnaires' disease will help confirm if this is a common source outbreak, if the genotypes match. Matching the genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_ will identify the environmental source for the individual cases. However, if the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping. - Mod.ML
