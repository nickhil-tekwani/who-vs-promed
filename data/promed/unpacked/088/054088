Typhoid Fever Cases In Florida Linked to Tropical Fruit Product
The Food and Drug Administration warned consumers yesterday [2/20/99] not
to eat El Sembrador brand frozen mamey from Guatemala, or drinks made from
the product, due to reports of typhoid fever in South Florida.
Mamey is a tropical fruit with pulp that is salmon pink to red and soft and
smooth in texture.
A statement from the FDA said it has determined that El Sembrador brand
frozen mamey has been found either in the freezers of victims' homes in the
restaurants where some ate the product.
The agency said its warning is based on epidemiological data in the South
Florida cases that shows a strong link between eating frozen mamey and
getting typhoid fever. It said the 13 reported illnesses so far -- all of
which required hospitalization -- occurred between mid-December and early
February, mostly in Hispanic communities.
Typhoid fever is a bacterial infection that causes persistent and high
fever, abdominal cramps, loss of appetite and fatigue. It most often is
acquired by eating contaminated food and drinking contaminated water or
beverages.
