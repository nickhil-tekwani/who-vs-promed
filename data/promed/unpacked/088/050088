Young French Tourist's Death No. 6 in Chiang Mai
------------------------------------------------
The revelation of a 6th death and the results of an investigation by
Thailand's Department of Disease Control has shed new light on the
series of mysterious fatalities in Chiang Mai.

The 6th death involved a Frenchwoman -- one of 2 who fell sick, a
media release from the department says. It highlighted the exceptional
nature of a complaint that appears to have struck down 6 young women
aged 23-33 between 9 Jan 2011 and 4 Feb 2011, killing 3 of them.

These 3 deaths -- the unnamed Frenchwoman, a New Zealand woman also
23, and an American, aged 33 -- have been linked by the media to 3
other deaths, 2 British pensioners, a man and a woman and a
47-year-old Thai guide.

The joint investigation by the department with the Chiang Mai
Provincial Health Office found 4 clinically-confirmed cases of
myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and another 2 patients
with mild symptoms.

"These 6 patients were among 3 separate groups of tourists visiting
Chiang Mai, Thailand, between 9 Jan 2011 and 4 Feb 2011. All were
young women aged 23-33 years and were from the United States (1),
Canada (1), France (2) and New Zealand (3)." 5 of the 6 women "became
ill while visiting Chiang Mai and one developed symptoms 3 days before
arriving there." However, an extensive epidemiological investigation
"has not revealed any common exposures across the 3 groups."

The media release says autopsies on 2 of the dead patients (American
and French) were done by forensic medical experts from Chiang Mai
University. The joint investigation team found 4 clinically-confirmed
cases of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and another 2
patients with mild symptoms. "The autopsies found nothing abnormal
except for inflammation of the heart muscle," it says.

"The Department of Disease Control has shared this information with
the World Health Organisation and US CDC offices in Bangkok, as well
as the New Zealand Embassy and the International Health Regulation
focal points of France and the European Community." The report
carefully distinguishes between the cases involving the 6 young women
and the other cases.

"In a separate episode, since 3 Feb 2011, there were 3 other deaths
in the same hotel where the 3 New Zealanders stayed," it says. "This
included an elderly British couple and a 47-year-old Thai woman. As
these 3 deaths occurred outside the hospital, the police took charge
of the investigation. The autopsies of the 2 elderly Britons found a
high degree of coronary occlusion while the examination of the Thai
woman found no inflammation of the heart muscle or any other clear
evidence to explain the cause of her death."

One recent report on the Chiang Mai cases also claimed there had been
50 "unexplained deaths" among expats on Phuket in an 8-month period
last year [2010]. Germany's honorary consul for Phuket, Dirk Naumann,
said today: "That's absolute rubbish. If it was true, all the honorary
consuls would have been up in arms about it."

Neither of the online sites that carried the misleading article --
Asia Sentinel or Irrawaddy -- has responded to requests that they
correct the falsehood.

Two young women -- a 22-year-old Norwegian and a 27-year-old American
-- died within hours of falling sick at a guest house on the holiday
island of Phi Phi, off Phuket, in May 2009 in a baffling case that
failed to produce a cause for their deaths.

[Chiang Mai is located in the mountainous north of Thailand and is a
favourite destination for tourists, attracting backpackers as well as
a more upmarket clientele of all ages. The hotel involved has been
rated a 2/3 star establishment. The HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive
map of Thailand can be accessed at: <http://healthmap.org/r/00cC>.

Myocarditis can be caused by a variety of infections (mainly viral),
and by immune diseases (such as systemic lupus, etc.), pregnancy, and
other ill-defined conditions. The commonest cause of myocarditis is
viral infection of heart muscle resulting in local inflammation.
Enteroviruses are the agents most commonly associated with
myocarditis. After the initial infection subsides, the body's immune
system may continue to inflict inflammatory damage to the heart muscle
prolonging the myocarditis. This circumstance may make it difficult to
attribute the condition to any particular virus. Enteroviral
infections are prevalent where living conditions and hygiene are
inadequate.

While it is feasible to attribute the the Chiang Mai incident to
viral infection, no positive evidence has been advanced to confirm
this possibility and other circumstances, other than fortuitous
coincidence, should be considered - Mod.CP

How suspicious that so many deaths are linked to the same hotel and
the same city. It would seem unlikely that food poisoning is the
source of the situation. We are not told if the victim that died in
the city had any association with the hotel. However, I might be
willing to consider an herbal preparation or seasoning that is popular
in this area and is not prepared properly, or has been mistakenly
identified and is a toxic plant.

There are vegetation and herbs that may cause cardiac issues, but for
surgery to correct it seems a bit odd. An additional oddity is that
this myocarditis has come on quickly enough to kill these people. This
had to be something very potent. Things like _Nerium oleander_ come to
mind, and may possibly be used in food preparation, such as a fuel
source for cooking, or a stick to place the food on. A pancake type of
food on a stick is popular in Thailand. I am not suggesting this is
the cause but rather speculating as these cases seem to have baffled
the investigators.

The strong connection between the hotel and the majority of the
victims may also make me think of perhaps a chemical in the air
handling system, or on the beds perhaps.

It is odd that most of the victims are women. While women may be
vulnerable in many ways, as are the aged couple, this is still rather
unsettling. - Mod.TG]
