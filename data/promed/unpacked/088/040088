Australian farmers fear apple blight
------------------------------------
Australian apple and pear growers fear their $400 million industry could be
destroyed by fire blight following a [recent recommendation by the Federal
Government's quarantine authority to overturn a ban on apple imports from
New Zealand. A draft risk assessment released by Biosecurity Australia set
out conditions for New Zealand apples to enter Australia provided they pass
stringent tests. New Zealand, plagued by fire blight for decades, has been
putting enormous political pressure on Australia to remove its ban on apple
imports, reimposed in 1998.
Australian Apple and Pear Growers Association chief executive Jon Durham
[said that the industry would be contacting international experts on plant
diseases to [assist the association to respond to the assessment within 60
days. Durham [believes that safeguards outlined in the statement [would
not protect Australia's orchards from the crippling disease, [warning that
the disease [could destroy Australia's pear industry and severely impact on
most modern apple orchards.
Australia is one of only a few fruit-growing countries not affected by fire
blight. The [bacterium disfigures and kills fruit trees and the only
chemical known to have any effect on [the pathogen is not allowed in
Australia. Victoria's Goulburn Valley region, which produces apples and
pears worth about $200 million annually, is especially vulnerable because of
climatic factors and the use of susceptible cultivars.
The Federal Government is expected to come under pressure from the states to
maintain the ban on New Zealand apples.

[Quarantines are nasty problems to sort out. Considering recent instances
(plum pox potyvirus [PPVin North America, the interception of PPV-infected
plant tissues at the Sydney Airport), it is reasonable to err on the side of
caution. I am surprised that Australia has remained free of the pathogen
(_Erwinia amylovora_). Do any of our Australian subscribers know whether
the pathogen has ever been detected in Australia? Have any plants ever been
identified as infected with the pathogen in the natural state? What is the
history of quarantine against importing apples into Australia? - Mod.DH
