A Hillsborough woman has died of a rare, mosquito-borne disease that
causes inflammation of the brain. Hillsborough health officials on
Tuesday [20 Jul 2010] announced the state's 1st death from eastern
equine encephalitis [EEE] since 2008. Only 5-10 cases each year are
reported nationally. In recent weeks, 4 horses in Hillsborough have
tested positive for EEE, health officials said, increasing the
potential for people to get infected.

The disease is transmitted by a mosquito bite. Symptoms can begin
4-10 days after the bite of an infected mosquito. They include sudden
headache, high fever, chills, and vomiting. The disease can progress
into disorientation, seizures, and coma. There is no treatment
specifically for an EEE [virus] infection. About a third of patients
will die, and many of those who survive have brain damage, the Health
Department noted.

"This tragic loss of life is a reminder that as we move through the
summer months, we must all be aware of how we can protect ourselves
from mosquito-borne diseases," Dr Douglas Holt, director of the
Hillsborough County Health Department, said in a statement.

Health officials declined to release additional information about the
woman, who lived in northern Hillsborough County and died on 1 Jul
[2010].

Early this morning [21 Jul 2010], Hillsborough County's mosquito
control department plans to spray pesticide by air in the North Tampa
area, as it does regularly around the county during the summer rainy
season. The mosquito population is closely tied to weather patterns.
When Hillsborough sees more water, it can expect greater mosquito
activity, said Hillsborough County spokesman Willie Puz.

To protect yourself, health officials recommend the following:
- Avoid being outdoors at dusk and dawn.
- Wear clothing that covers your skin.
- Use mosquito repellents containing DEET (N,
N-diethyl-meta-toluamide, or N, N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide).
Picaridin and oil of lemon eucalyptus are other options.
- Check the drainage around your home. Get rid of standing water
where mosquitoes can lay their eggs.

[Florida is endemic for EEE virus. There have been a number of equine
cases of EEE virus infection this year (2010). This is the 1st human
case in 2010. There is no vaccine available for human use, although
EEE vaccinations are available and recommended for equine animals.
