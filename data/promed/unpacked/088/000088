The Health Administration Institute (IASAUDE) confirmed today [28 Dec 2018] that there are 3 cases of measles in Madeira, Portugal, admitting that it is an outbreak. "[A total of 3] cases of measles were confirmed in the Autonomous Region of Madeira with [an] epidemiological link between them, confirming the existence of an outbreak," IASAUDE said in a statement.

According to this report, the 3 cases are adults -- 2 females and 1 male -- who presented a benign evolution of the disease and were discharged from hospital. "In one of the confirmed cases, the epidemiological link with the outbreaks in the region of Lisbon and Vale do Tejo is under investigation," said the agency, noting that "the Regional Health Authority is investigating and monitoring the situation in accordance with the foreseen in the National Measles Elimination Program."

A total of 5 flight attendants and one passenger have been diagnosed with measles in Spain, according to the head of preventive medicine at the Hospital Clinic in Barcelona, Antoni Trilla. Writing on Twitter, Mr. Trilla said that those affected travelled on domestic flights and to other countries in the European Union in November [2018], adding that the possibility of new cases has not been ruled out.

Measles is uncommon in the UK because of the effectiveness of vaccination. But European countries are seeing a surge in the number of cases, which has been blamed on a drop in the number of people being vaccinated. In the first 6 months of 2018, more than 41 000 people were infected in Europe, according to the World Health Organisation. In 2017, there were 23 927 cases over the year and in 2016 there were 5273.

Speaking in August [2018], Dr. Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at Public Health England, said: "We have seen a number of measles outbreaks in England which are linked to ongoing large outbreaks in Europe. The majority of cases we are seeing are in teenagers and young adults who missed out on their MMR vaccine when they were children. Anyone who missed out on their MMR vaccine in the past or are unsure if they had 2 doses should contact their GP practice to catch up. We would encourage people to ensure they are up to date with their MMR vaccine before travelling to countries with ongoing measles outbreaks, heading to large gatherings such as festivals, or before starting university."

The health authorities in Taipei City said Sun [23 Dec 2018] that a baby infected with measles traveled on the MRT Wenhu (Brown) Line during the 13-15 Dec 2018 period and encouraged anyone who took the metro during that time to pay close attention to any indication of measles symptoms for up to 18 days.

The patient was identified as an 11-month infant residing in Taipei, who was confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) on Sat [22 Dec 2018] as an imported case of measles contracted in the Philippines. In its statement, the CDC said the baby boy visited the Southeast Asian nation with family from 30 Nov to 4 Dec 2018.

The patient developed a fever, rhinitis and fatigue on returning to Taipei, and after seeing a doctor on 14 Dec 2018, was admitted to hospital 5 days later, the CDC said. The infant, who has been discharged from hospital, was confirmed on Sat [22 Dec 2018] as having contracted measles, the source of the infection being the Philippines, the agency added.

The Taipei City Department of Health said Sunday [23 Dec 2018] that the measles would have been communicable from 13-21 Dec 2018. During that period, the patient had contact with 221 people, including medical care personnel, other patients at 2 local clinics and the hospital, and family members, all of whom have been told to keep an eye out for related symptoms and advised to seek medical care if any signs of the illness present, the city department said in a statement.

CDC data show that Taiwan has recorded 37 cases of measles infection this year [2018], including 10 imported cases, mostly imported from Southeast Asian countries.

The Health Ministry has issued a warning to the public about a measles carrier who may have infected passengers aboard Israel Railways trains traveling from Ashkelon to Tel Aviv University on 25 Dec 2018. Anyone who may have been exposed to the infectious virus, especially those born after 1957 who haven't receive the necessary 2 shots, is being requested to visit a health clinic immediately in order to get vaccinated.

The measles epidemic has occupied health officials in recent months after an 18-month-old toddler died in Jerusalem on 1 Nov 2018. On 19 Dec 2018, an 82-year-old woman in the capital became the 2nd fatality from the outbreak. The child's death was the 1st recorded death from measles in Israel in 15 years. The baby, reportedly not vaccinated, was brought to the hospital without a pulse.

According to the Health Ministry, there were 948 measles cases in October 2018 and 893 cases in November 2018. As of last Wed [19 Dec 2018], there have been 194 cases this month.

Despite the declining trend, the ministry is continuing to promote vaccinations and hopes to halt the spread completely. The bulk of measles cases have been in the Jerusalem area. The Health Ministry said earlier this year [2018] that 90% of the cases in Israel were either people who had not been vaccinated or who came into contact with unvaccinated people.

Measles can have lasting effects such as hearing loss, and is fatal for one in 1000 children who catch it. The MMR vaccine is 97% effective in preventing infection with the measles virus when the recommended 2 doses are received on time, according to the Health Ministry.
