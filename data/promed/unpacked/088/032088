The rollout of a drug that prevents HIV infection was followed by a reduction in condom use among gay and bisexual men in Australia, according to a study published in the journal Lancet HIV [1]. But so effective was the drug that HIV infection rates in the study region declined anyway, the researchers concluded.

During the rapid distribution of a drug that prevents infection -- a strategy called pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP -- among gay and bisexual men in Australia, researchers found that unprotected sex increased even among those not on PrEP, suggesting that perceptions of risk had declined in communities where the drug was widely available.

"Safe sex is basically transformed by PrEP," said Martin Holt, a researcher at University of New South Wales in Sydney, who led the study. "It's great that these guys are feeling optimistic about avoiding HIV, but it has disrupted prevention methods at a community level."

The daily pill is highly effective in combating HIV infection and is recommended for at-risk populations, such as gay men and intravenous drug users, according to the World Health Organization.

The cross-sectional survey included almost 17 000 men in Victoria and New South Wales who said they had recently had casual sex with a male partner. From 2013 to 2017, the proportion of HIV-negative men using PrEP increased to 24 percent from 2 percent. During that time, the proportion of respondents with casual partners who said they consistently used condoms dropped to 31 percent from 46 percent.

Strikingly, unprotected sex among men who did not take PrEP increased 9 percent.

"Rightly or wrongly, there is a sense among people that men can have safer sex without condoms for the first time," said Mitchell Warren, the executive director of AVAC [AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition], which promotes HIV prevention worldwide. "We need a nuanced conversation about the patterns of choices."

One concern is that PrEP does not protect against other sexually transmitted infections. As use of the pill spreads, some clinicians are detecting more cases of diseases such as gonorrhea, as well as drug resistance to them, according to Dr Paul Volberding, the director of the AIDS Research Institute at the University of California, San Francisco. It is not clear whether the higher case counts are a result of decreased condom use or merely better surveillance.

"Does this mean that pushing PrEP is a bad thing? Of course not. It is preventing HIV, which is what it was designed to do," Dr Volberding said. "But the challenges posed are no minor issue, and we need to take them seriously."

Dr Holt said he was uncertain how decreased condom usage will affect rates of HIV infection in the long term, but that so-called herd immunity -- the protective effects of a growing population of men who use PrEP and do not transmit HIV -- could at least partially counterbalance the effects of unsafe behaviors.

Infection rates declined despite a rise in unprotected sex, suggesting widespread use of the drug may mitigate the effects of riskier behavior.

Summary
"Background. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been rapidly rolled out in large, publicly funded implementation projects in Victoria [Vic] and New South Wales [NSW], Australia. Using behavioural surveillance of gay and bisexual men, we analysed the uptake and effect of PrEP, particularly on condom use by gay and bisexual men not using PrEP.

"Methods. We collected data from the Melbourne and Sydney Gay Community Periodic Surveys (GCPS), cross-sectional surveys of adult gay and bisexual men in Melbourne, VIC, and Sydney, NSW. Recruitment occurred at gay venues or events and online. Eligible participants were 18 years or older (face-to-face recruitment) or 16 years or older (online recruitment), identified as male (including transgender participants who identified as male); and having had sex with a man in the past 5 years or identified as gay or bisexual, or both. Using multivariate logistic regression, we assessed trends in condom use, condomless anal intercourse with casual partners (CAIC), and PrEP use by gay and bisexual men, controlling for sample variation over time.

"Findings. Between Jan 1, 2013, and March 31, 2017, 27 011 participants completed questionnaires in the Melbourne (n=13 051) and Sydney (n=13 960) GCPS. 16 827 reported sex with casual male partners in the 6 months before survey and were included in these analyses. In 2013, 26 (1 percent) of 2692 men reported CAIC and were HIV-negative and using PrEP, compared with 167 (5 percent) of 3660 men in 2016 and 652 (16 percent) of 4018 men in 2017 (p less than 0.0001). Consistent condom use was reported by 1360 (46 percent) of 2692 men in 2013, 1523 (42 percent) of 3660 men in 2016, and 1229 (31 percent) of 4018 men in 2017 (p less than 0.0001). In 2013, 800 (30 percent) of 2692 men who were HIV-negative or untested and not on PrEP reported CAIC, compared with 1118 (31 percent) of 3660 men in 2016, and 1166 (29 percent) of 4018 in 2017 (non-significant trend).

"Interpretation. A rapid increase in PrEP use by gay and bisexual men in Melbourne and Sydney was accompanied by an equally rapid decrease in consistent condom use. Other jurisdictions should consider the potential for community-level increases in CAIC when modelling the introduction of PrEP and in monitoring its effect."

Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is the use of anti-HIV drugs, usually with Truvada (a combination of tenofovir/emtricitabine) daily, in people who are HIV-negative to prevent HIV infection as a consequence of risky sexual activity. When used as directed, PrEP has been shown to be highly effective at reducing the risk of contracting HIV infection. PrEP is supposed to be used with other risk reduction strategies such as condoms because people taking PrEP are still at some risk of contracting HIV and other types of sexually transmitted infection.

The study in Victoria and New South Wales Australia cited in the news report found HIV infection rates declined despite a rise in unprotected, condomless sex in MSM, likely a consequence of increasing rates of PrEP use in HIV-negative men who have sex with men (MSM). The study also found that condomless sex increased among MSM who did not take PrEP. Although not reported in the Australian study, marked increases in rates of other sexually transmitted infections, specifically gonorrhea and syphilis, in MSM have accompanied increasing rates of condomless sex in these men worldwide, which in part has been attributed to increased testing for these diseases.
