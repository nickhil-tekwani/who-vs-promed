3 more deaths due to meningococcemia, 214 infected
--------------------------------------------------
3 more deaths due to deadly meningococcemia have been reported in the
national capital since 9 May 2005, taking the toll to 17, while the disease
has afflicted 27 more people, including a Delhi government hospital nurse,
raising the number of such patients to 214.
2 deaths reported from All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS) were
confirmed by MCD's director of health administration J A Banvalikar, while
one patient succumbed to the disease in Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Hospital.
"The Medical Superintendents of different hospitals clarified that all
doctors and staff have been vaccinated against the disease and the
relatives have been given preventive medicines," Dr Banvalikar said.
In the 1st case of hospital staff being infected by the disease in the
current outbreak, a nurse from Hedgewar Hospital was reported to have
developed the disease.
Out of the 27 fresh cases reported during last 24 hours, 3 are from outside
Delhi, Banvalikar said. Meanwhile as many as 22 cases have been reported
from various places in Haryana where the disease has claimed 2 lives, a
Health Department spokesman said in Chandigarh. 10 cases from Gurgaon, and
one case each from Bihar and Rajasthan were also reported.

[The outbreak continues and more cases are being reported outside Dehli
proper. A case has occurred in a health care worker (HCW) as well. HCWs as
an overall group are not at high risk for secondary transmission, and
chemoprophylaxis with an antimicrobial agent such as ciprofloxacin or
rifampin is not routinely recommended for the usual contact that a HCW,
even an emergency service person, has with an infected patient. It is
possible that the HCW's exposure was outside her job, but such information
is not supplied.
The kinds of contact that elicit the recommendation of chemoprophylaxis are
those related to direct exposure with the patient's oral secretions
including mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, endotracheal intubation,
endotracheal tube management, or other direct exposures (1). A risk
assessment of HCWs from the UK found that the absolute risk in HCWs was 0.8
per 100 000, about 25 times higher than the risk in the population at large
(2). The risk among HCWs was 500 times lower than among household contacts
(210 per 100 000) in endemic disease.
The meningococcus is spread from person to person through nasopharyngeal
secretions or large-particle respiratory droplets that are unlikely to
remain in the air for distances beyond 3 feet (2).
