West Nile virus in Canada - WHO update 9
----------------------------------------
As of Tue 12 Nov 2002, Health Canada has reported a total number of 141
human cases of West Nile virus infection: 84 suspected cases, 57 confirmed
cases, including 2 deaths. One confirmed case is resident in the province
of Alberta, one suspected case and 7 confirmed cases are resident in the
province of Quebec, and the remaining 83 suspected cases and 49 confirmed
cases are resident in the province of Ontario (see previous report:
<http://www.who.int/disease-outbreak-news/n2002/november/6november2002.html>.
One additional death in a confirmed case and 5 deaths in suspected cases
are under investigation in Ontario to determine whether these can be
attributed to West Nile virus infection. The one confirmed case in Alberta
and one confirmed case in Ontario probably acquired infection while
travelling in the United States whereas all other cases acquired their
infection within their home province.
