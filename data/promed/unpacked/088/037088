Q fever vaccine, availability (02) 970228172147]
The Q fever vaccine currently used by the Army, IND 610, is very similar to
the licensed Australian vaccine, Q-Vax, and it is used here at Fort Detrick,
Maryland, to protect non-immune individuals who may be exposed to _Coxiella
burnetii_ in the course of their work. There are a number of other
facilities in this country and Canada at which this vaccine is utilized, in
accordance with an investigational protocol.
Because this vaccine has, in the past, caused severe local reactions in
individuals already immune to _Coxiella burnetii_, a screening intradermal
skin test with Q fever antigen is required prior to vaccination. The purpose
of the skin test is to identify those individuals at risk of developing
severe local reactions to the vaccine, and individuals with a positive skin
test should not be vaccinated. A similar problem exists with the Australian
vaccine, and a screening skin test is also required prior to use of that
product. In addition, it should be noted that individuals with positive skin
test reactions to this Q fever antigen do not need vaccination, because the
positive skin test reflects pre-existing protective immunity to Q fever.
As an investigational product, IND 610 is subject to applicable FDA
regulations and policies. It can be administered only according to an
approved investigational protocol under the supervision of the principal or
an associate investigator, but it is not being "held in reserve". Inquiries
regarding the availability and use of this Q fever vaccine should be directed
to the Commander/Director, USAMMDA, Fort Detrick, Frederick, MD 21702, Ph.
301/619-7643.
