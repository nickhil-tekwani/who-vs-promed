[ProMED would like more information regarding the confirmation or not of
the allegation of more than 20 cases of anthrax from an area in India
associated with 3 deaths. Clusters of this disease less likely due to
cutaneous infection, the most common form of the disease, but rather to the
much less common gastrointestinal and inhalational forms. GI anthrax is
often associated with eating contaminated meat from an infected herbivore
and the inhalational disease from intentional or unintentional
aerosolization of spores. Both these latter forms have much higher
case-fatality rates as that described in the above posting. -Mod. LL]
