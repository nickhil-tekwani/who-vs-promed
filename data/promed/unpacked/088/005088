There have been a number recent ProMED-mail listings on diseases due to
_Escherichia coli_. Not all _E. coli_ are identical. The various _E.
coli_ pathotypes and associated nomenclature can be confusing to the
non-specialist.

There are a number of recent reviews on _E. coli_ that may be of use to
ProMED-mail readers including:

BOOKS:
Escherichia coli: Mechanisms of Virulence. Max Sussman (ed). Cambridge
University Press, 1997. (Includes 21 review chapters on intestinal and
extraintestinal _E. coli_ infections)
Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Other Shiga Toxin-Producing E. coli Strains.
James B. Kaper and Alison O'Brien (eds). ASM Press, 1998. (Includes 45
chapters on all aspects of disease due these organisms including human and
animal epidemiology, food safety, pathogenesis, treatment, and vaccine
development. A complete table of contents and
ordering information can be found at <http://www.asmusa.org/press/kaper.htm>)

REVIEW ARTICLES:
J. P. Nataro and J. B. Kaper. Diarrheagenic Escherichia coli. Clin.
Microbiol. Rev. 11(1):142-201. (Reviews all aspects of all pathotypes of

intestinal disease. The complete text of this and the following review can
