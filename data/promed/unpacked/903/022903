_Varroa jacobsoni_ (bronze bee mite) in honey bees, _Apis mellifera_, in
New Zealand.
Suspicion based on clinical examination of bees and hives, confirmed by
laboratory identification of the agent. Some infested hives examined were
noted to have experienced population crashes, a symptom seen after
infestation has been established for 3-5 years.
Geographical location: Otahuhu, South Auckland
No. of new outbreaks: 1
Species code: API
Susceptible/cases: 14 hives on four premises were initially visited and
inspected.
Deaths: 8 of these hives were dead, with others showing low populations and
other typical symptoms
Destroyed: 2 hives on first property identified were immediately destroyed
by the owner.
Description of newly affected population :
The affected population at this stage comprises beehives kept by small
hobby beekeepers. Larger commercial operations are, however, within the
controlled area that MAF has described. MAF is working closely with the
National Beekeepers Association to identify all beekeepers in the
controlled area to allow hive visits and inspections.
Laboratory where diagnosis was made: National Plant Pest Reference
Laboratory, Lincoln, New Zealand.
Diagnostic test used: Identification of the agent. Causal agent: _Varroa
jacobsoni_
Source of agent/Origin of infection: Unknown.
Mode of spread: All the suspected infected premises are within a 10 km
distance from each other, suggesting that natural dispersal through bee
movements (abandoning and robbing of crashed hives) is the likely means of
dissemination. Tracing forwards and backwards from these premises, in
particular identifying high risk movements such as bees, hives and
equipment, is taking place.
Other epidemiological details: The controlled area has been designated as
being that area within the territorial authority boundaries of Rodney
District, North Shore City, Waitakere City, Auckland City, Manukau City,
Papakura District, Franklin District, Waikato District, Hamilton City, or
Hauraki District. Movement controls comprising restrictions on movement of
live or dead bees, beehives and used beekeeping equipment have been
imposed. Movements of these items within and from the controlled area is
prohibited. A further restriction has been imposed on movements of these
items from the North to the South Islands. A full-scale delimiting survey
is to be undertaken within the controlled area. High priority has been
assigned to visiting and inspecting beehives in the area immediately
surrounding the infected premises; the outer perimeter of the controlled
area; and high risk traces from infected premises. Reports in response to a
MAF request that beekeepers nationally inspect hives looking for signs of
_Varroa_ infestation will also be investigated.

Biosecurity alert for bee pest
------------------------------
The bee industry is in the middle of a biosecurity nightmare after the
bronze mite pest was found in hives in South Auckland. New Zealand's $1.8
million live bee export industry has been halted while the Ministry of
Agriculture and Forestry tries to establish how far the killer bug has
spread. MAF has declared a controlled area from Rodney, north of Auckland
to Waikato and the Hauraki district, including Great Barrier Island. This
means bee keepers cannot move bees or hives inside the area, or outside the
zone. Specialist teams of apiarists began searching for further
infestations of the _Varroa_ spp. mite late Wednesday. Within minutes the
foreign invader was found.
The tiny bronze mite sucks the blood from adult bees. It also attacks
larvae by biting bits off it. Within 3 years it takes over the hive and the
bees die.
MAF were alerted to the mite on Tuesday after a South Auckland beekeeper
noticed it in his hives. Hives on 3 properties nearby showed signs of
infestation. Now all hives within a 50 km radius are being checked. MAF
says if the disease has spread widely, then overseas experience shows
containment and eradication of the mite is extremely difficult. Keepers say
mite outbreaks in the United Kingdom killed off over half the population
there. MAF officials say if that happens here, our two billion dollar
agricultural and horticulture industries could be threatened because there
won't be enough bees to pollinate plants.
Apiarists are being asked to look out for small bronze mites on bees and
larvae, unusually low bee numbers in hives, weak crawling bees and sudden
hive crashes. The mite is spread by humans moving bees and equipment, and
by bees themselves. "As these hives die, what happens is other bees come in
and rob the hives, and the bees themselves from the dying hives will
disperse and join other colonies," says Matthew Stone from MAF. The
importation of live bees has been banned in New Zealand for 40 years. How
the mite got here isn't clear, but a likely scenario is someone introduced
infected bees illegally.

_Varroa jacobsoni_ (Bronze bee mite) in honey bees, _Apis mellifera_, in
New Zealand: update
Confirmed diagnosis by laboratory identification of the agent.
Date of initial detection: 11 Apr 2000
Estimated date of first infection: Unknown. Some infested hives examined
were noted to have experienced population crashes, symptoms seen after
infestation has been established for 3-5 years.
Geographical location: The location of the apiaries first identified as
infested was the suburb of Otahuhu in south Auckland. Subsequently infested
apiaries have been detected in the suburbs of Manuwera, Mangere, Otahuhu,
Papatoetoe, Lynfield, Glendowie, Pukekohe and Waiuku. A cluster of infested
apiaries has been identified on the Hauraki Plains to the south-east of
Auckland.
No. of new outbreaks: The outbreak is still considered to result from a
single event, and a pattern of clusters is emerging.
Species code: API
Total number of animals in outbreaks: n/a
Susceptible/cases: Within the immediate vicinity of the outbreak, 78
apiaries (599 hives) had been visually inspected and infestation found on
16 apiaries (163 hives) as of 13 Apr 2000.
Deaths: n/a
Destroyed: MAF has not ordered compulsory destructions at this stage,
although some apiarists are acting on a recommendation from the National
Beekeepers Association to destroy infested hives.
Description of newly affected population : A controlled area was designated
as being that area within the territorial authority boundaries of Rodney
District, North Shore City, Waitakere City, Auckland City, Manukau City,
Papakura District, Franklin District, Waikato District, Hamilton City, and
Hauraki District. This area comprises the territorial boundaries of those
districts being within a 50 km radius of infected properties identified on
12 Apr 2000. The cluster of infested apiaries in the Hauraki Plains is
located near the south-eastern boundary of the controlled area. A
preliminary examination of data from the National Beekeepers Association
register indicates there are approximately 2365 apiaries (comprising 26 908
hives) within the controlled area.
Laboratory where diagnosis was made: National Plant Pest Reference
Laboratory, Lincoln, New Zealand.
Diagnostic test used: Identification of the agent
On premises within the immediate vicinity of the known infested premises,
diagnosis is by visual inspection of hives and uncapping of brood to
examine brood cells, and submission of bee samples to the laboratory. From
14 Apr 2000 the diagnostic protocol to be used when maximum sensitivity is
required will be fluvalinate impregnated strips hung in hives, with
laboratory identification of any mites via collection on sticky bottom boards.
Causal agent: _Varroa jacobsoni_
Source of agent/Origin of infection: Unknown.
Mode of spread: Natural dispersal through bee movements (abandoning and
robbing of crashed hives) is still considered to have been the most likely
means of dissemination amongst the infested hives identified to date.
Other epidemiological details: Movement controls within the controlled area
and on restricted places (the premises outside the controlled area
identified through high risk traces) include a prohibition of movement on
live or dead bees, beehives and used beekeeping equipment between sites and
from the area or place. A further restriction has been imposed on movements
of these items from the North to the South Islands. Sampling since the
outbreak was first detected has not yet established a clear southern
boundary to the infested area. Fifteen field teams are engaged in
inspections of hives around known infested premises, on the basis of the
clustering pattern of infested apiaries that is emerging.
The strategy being employed is after all apiaries in the vicinity of known
infested apiaries have been inspected, field teams are being directed to
apiary districts approximately 20 km further away from the center of the
outbreak. Apiary districts are being sampled at a level to provide 95%
confidence of detecting one infested hive assuming a prevalence of 25% (the
approximate prevalence being found in infested clusters). It is intended
that once hive inspection and bee sampling fail to detect further
infestations, the diagnostic protocol employing fluvalinate impregnated
strips will be applied to provide the necessary confidence that the
southern boundary has been reached. Tracing forwards and backwards from the
known infested premises is occurring, in particular identifying high risk
movements such as bees, hives and equipment. To date, three high risk
traces lead to premises outside the controlled area. These premises have
been made restricted places subject to movement control. No _Varroa_ mites
have been seen on samples of bees submitted to the laboratory from two of
these premises. However, the diagnostic protocol employing fluvalinate
impregnated strips is to be used on all 3 premises prior to considering
lifting movement control. Hives will be sampled at a rate sufficient to
provide 95% confidence of detecting one infected hive assuming 5% prevalence.
Tracing from known infested premises within the controlled area is continuing.
