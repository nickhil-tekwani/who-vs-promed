Japan's Agriculture Ministry said on Tuesday an outbreak of Foot-and- Mouth
Disease (FMD) among cattle in southern Japan had been confirmed by tests
performed by an institute in Britain.
It is the first outbreak of the disease, which is fatal and highly
contagious to cattle and pigs but cannot be transmitted to humans, since
1908 in Japan. The ministry said in a statement an institute in Britain
which is a world leader in identifying FMD confirmed cattle on a small farm
in Miyazaki prefecture on Japan's southern island of Kyushu were infected
with the disease.
The cattle tested have been destroyed.
Earlier on Tuesday ministry officials said a second suspected case of FMD
had been found among cattle at another farm in the same region, heightening
fears of an epidemic potentially devastating the livestock industry in
Japan's premier meat-producing region.
The ministry has banned the transfer of cattle within a 50 km radius of the
first farm in an attempt to prevent the disease from spreading, the
statement said.
Over the weekend, South Korea's government-run quarantine service said it
had confirmed a livestock illness reported near the town of Paju last week
was FMD.
South Korean officials said, however, the country has not yet received a
result of tests by the same institute in Britain.
