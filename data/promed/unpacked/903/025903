The county medical officer at the Department of Communicable Disease
Control in the county of Halland in Southern Sweden has since 5 Aug 2008
received 5 reports of patients suffering from gastroenteritis induced by
enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), after visits to relatives in
the former Yugoslavia. One patient was also positive for _Salmonella
enteritidis_.

Case 1: A 15 year old female visited Sarajevo in Bosnien-Hercegovina and
fell ill on 28 Jun 2008. She was diagnosed on 5 Aug 2008 in Sweden with
EHEC O166, VT 1 positive and eae-gene negative. She was also positive for
_Salmonella enteritidis_. She had suffered from a severe gastroenteritis
with diarrhoea, pain, and blood in her stools.

Case 2: A one year old girl who became ill on 31 Jul 2008 in Montenegro and
was diagnosed in Sweden on 15 Aug 2008, so far untyped EHEC, VT 1 positive.

Case 3: A one year old boy who became ill on 10 Aug 2008 in Kosovo and was
diagnosed in Sweden on 18 Aug 2008 with EHEC, VT 1 positive. He was
admitted to the Department of Pediatrics.

Case 4: A 4 month old boy who became ill on 8 Aug 2008 in Deqan, Kosovo,
during a one month stay at his grandparents' farm. He was diagnosed on 20
Aug 2008 with EHEC O26, VT 1 positive and eae-gene positive.

Case 5: The mother of case 4. She had a gastroenteritis on 15 Jul 2008 and
was tested since her boy was diagnosed with EHEC. She was diagnosed on 29
Aug 2008 with EHEC and VT 1 positive.

None of the cases have had signs of the haemolytic-uremic syndrome. All
reported cases have an ethnic origin in former Yugoslavia. This observation
of several EHEC cases from former Yugoslavia during one summer month is
unique. During previous years since 2004, 9 EHEC cases have been reported
in travellers from former Yugoslavia.

During 2007, 2 cases -- one from Croatia and one from Kosovo -- with O157,
VT 1 and 2 positive, eae-gene positive were reported. During 2006 one case
from Croatia and 2 from Kosovo with O157, VT 1 and 2 positive were
reported. In 2005 one case from Bosnien-Hercegovina non-O157 and VT 1
positive was recorded. In 2004 we had 3 cases from Montenegro untyped.

[These reports of severe bacterial gastroenteritis among patients in Sweden
recently returned from countries of the former Yugoslavia, suggest that the
outbreak of severe gastroenteritis in Serbia (see reference below) among
visitors to Montenegro may not be attributable solely (or at all) to
norovirus infection. ProMED-mail thanks Dr Erntell for submitting this
highly relevant information.
