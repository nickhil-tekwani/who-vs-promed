The FDA has sent a Fresh Express _Cyclosporia_ warning letter as part of the investigation into the multistate foodborne illness outbreak of cyclosporiasis in the summer of 2020. The outbreak sickened at least 701 people in 14 states. The CDC and the FDA determined that Fresh Express bagged salad mixes that contained iceberg lettuce, carrots, and red cabbage was the source of this outbreak. There was also a Fresh Express _Cyclospora_ outbreak in 2018 associated with McDonald's salads that sickened more than 500 people.

The product in question was manufactured at the company's facility in Streamwood, Illinois. The presence of _Cyclospora cayetanensis_ in the bagged salads cause them to be adulterated per the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Because the only known reservoir of this parasite is in the human gut, that means that the product has been in direct or indirect contamination with human feces.

The FDA inspected the Streamwood facility and issued a Form FDA 483, which is filed when the government finds violations of food safety regulations. The government found that the company tested for the parasite but stated that "this testing was not performed as part of your verification activities for the control of the hazard of _Cyclospora cayetanensis_, but rather to better understand the parasite and potential control mechanisms." The FDA said that the company should reanalyze their Food Safety Plan to determine whether the preventive controls and grower/harvester verification activities are enough to ensure control of the parasite.

In addition, the FDA experienced delays in Fresh Express's response to requests for documents used in the traceback investigation. It took a week after the FDA asked Fresh Express to recall the product and share tracing information for them to comply. Fresh Express also needs to improve traceability systems and processes, along with the speed and accuracy by which the company complies with records and information requested by the government.

[Cyclosporiasis (https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/cyclosporiasis/) is an intestinal illness caused by the microscopic parasite _Cyclospora cayetanensis_. People can become infected with _Cyclospora_ by consuming food or water contaminated with the parasite. People living or traveling in countries where cyclosporiasis is endemic may be at increased risk of infection. Infected people shed unsporulated (non-infective; immature) _C. cayetanensis_ oocysts in their stool; immature oocysts usually require at least 1 to 2 weeks under favorable laboratory conditions to sporulate and become infective.

Symptoms of cyclosporiasis begin an average of 7 days (range, 2 days to 2 weeks or longer) after ingestion of sporulated oocysts (the infective form of the parasite).

Symptoms of cyclosporiasis may include the following:
- Watery diarrhea (most common)
- Loss of appetite
- Weight loss
- Cramping
- Bloating
- Increased gas
- Nausea
- Fatigue

Other symptoms that may occur but are less common include the following:
- Vomiting
- Low-grade fever.

If a person ill from cyclosporiasis is not treated, symptoms can persist for several weeks to a month or more. Some symptoms, such as diarrhea, can return; some symptoms, such as fatigue, may continue after the gastrointestinal symptoms have gone away. The infection usually is not life-threatening. Some infected persons do not have any symptoms, particularly persons from areas where cyclosporiasis is endemic, such as tropical and subtropical regions. - Mod.LL
