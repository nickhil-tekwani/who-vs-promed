An outbreak of a strange ailment has claimed more than 25 lives in Ode Irele in Irele local government area of Ondo State, a community leader has told SaharaReporters.

In a telephone interview with our correspondent, the community leader, Ayodele Omole, stated that the "strange ailment" broke out on Wednesday morning [15 Apr 2015] and had already created panic among residents, adding that many people were fleeing from the community. In a radio broadcast, the Ondo State Commissioner for Health, Dayo Adeyanju, confirmed the outbreak, but assured residents that it was not Ebola [virus disease].

Even though the source of the epidemic has not been determined, Mr Omole stated that many residents had blamed it on an "evil spiritual attack."

"We noticed the strange ailment yesterday [Wed 15 Apr 2015]," said Mr Omole. "Several people lost their sight before they died instantly. As at the last count, in the early hours of today [Thu 16 Apr 2015] more than 25 dead bodies were counted in the streets of Irele. Unlike yesterday, people are now scared of carrying the bodies because of fear of infections. Some residents have fled the community for Ore town while others are planning to leave for Akure for total safety."

He stated that, in addition causing blindness, the unknown disease also caused victims' tongues to swell abnormally, rendering the victims incapable of speech, prior to death within a few hours.

Mr Omole said many in the community saw the ailment as having "a spiritual cause," adding that they believed it was beyond the control of state health officials. He added that the residents were hoping that some traditional healers would quickly come in to help.

A young resident in the town said the gods in the community were angry because "some section of the shrine was recently destroyed and some sacred objects stolen by unknown people." He said some worshipers of the deity and traditional priests were meeting to discover those behind the theft.

Meanwhile, the state government has confirmed the outbreak of the "unknown disease," adding that it was on top of the situation.

In a broadcast on a state-owned radio station in Akure, the state capital, the Ondo State Commissioner for Health, Mr Adeyanju, said the ravaging disease was not Ebola as some feared. The commissioner stated that health officials and equipment had been deployed to the community to curtail the spread of the strange disease.

"The community outbreak team informed us yesterday morning [15 Apr 2015] of disease outbreak in Irele. The unknown disease isn't Ebola as it doesn't manifest any of its symptoms, but only attacks the central nervous system of the victims. We can't really say what is responsible for this ailment. It was clear that those who had died had no symptoms of vomiting or diarrhea," said Mr Adeyanju, adding that the symptoms of the ailment included headaches and loss of sight prior to death. The disease has been spread to the whole town and it has been very difficult to trace it to a particular source because it had already spread across the whole local government of Irele," he said.

The health commissioner disclosed that investigations had commenced to determine the cause and source of the strange epidemic stressing that blood samples from some victims have been taken to a laboratory in Lagos for tests

The ancient Ikale community in Irele Local Government Area of Ondo state has been hit by a mysterious disease, killing at least 14 people.

Daily Post gathered that the disease has been ravaging the community since the past 10 days.

According to Mr Taiwo Erukusi, an indigene of the community, residents of the community are now in confusion as the majority of the people are scared of touching the deceased to avoid being infected.

Our correspondent learnt that the said ailment is more deadly than the Ebola virus, as it will first blind the victim while also drawing out his tongue.

"We are worried. Our people are dying. We don't know this sickness. We are just done with elections and it's now this disease. Have we offended God? If we have, then we are seek forgiveness. God should forgive us. We can't touch those who have been killed. I have counted about 19, others said 14. God please, have mercy on us". One of the residents pleaded.

However, the state Commissioner for Health, Dr Dayo Adeyanju, said the disease was a strange ailment, and the symptoms include headache and loss of weight.

He informed that local and international health institutions were already carrying out investigation on the possible cause of the ailment and its treatment. Adeyanju urged residents not be scared, saying the state government was in control of the situation.

From our interaction with the medical team in the hospital, there is speculation that a seed (yet to be identified) probably consumed by the victims could have resulted in symptoms indicative of poisoning.

Following the outbreak of the yet-to-be-identified disease in Irele, Ondo State, our medical team decided to go on a fact-finding mission to Irele General Hospital.

According to the medical doctor overseeing activities in the hospital, Dr Sanni, 5 patients were admitted with symptoms including headache, passage of loose stool, sudden onset blindness, difficulty with speaking and hearing. On examination, all the patients were said to have elevated blood pressure and signs suggestive of raised intracranial pressure.

All the admitted patients are males, middle-aged, and all developed the illness at about the same time. 2 of the admitted patients died, while the remaining 3 insisted on being discharged against medical advice. They eventually left the hospital on [15 Apr 2015]. Following their exit, unconfirmed reports have it that one of them died at home.

Dr Sanni also talked about rumours of other mortalities within the town and that efforts are currently being made to collate the actual number of casualties.

Blood and CSF samples were taken from the victims that presented at the hospital and have been sent to LUTH [Lagos University Teaching Hospital] for comprehensive assays.

Personally, my conclusion following our trip to Irele General Hospital is that it is not likely that a contagious disease is on the break, although one can never say never!

Furthermore, the signs and symptoms of the admitted patients are not entirely in keeping with those of Ebola virus disease and other ailments in the viral haemorrhagic fever spectrum. However, definitive conclusions can be made once the investigation results are available.

In conclusion, the calm observed in the town is not reminiscent of the looming disaster we heard about before setting out.

[The outbreak is said to be occurring in the Ikale community in Irele Local Government Area of Ondo State and, according to one report above, the outbreak has occurred over the past 10 days. Irele had a population of 145 166 in 2006 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irele). Ondo State is one of 36 Nigerian states and is located on the Atlantic coast. The Ikale is one of the Yoruba subgroups (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ondo_State). For a map of Nigeria showing the location of Ondo State, see http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf.

We are not told the total number of affected people, but at least 25 people have died. According to one report above, all hospitalized patients were middle-aged males and developed the illness at about the same time. Patients are said to have had headache and sudden loss of sight before death, with loose stool, and difficulty hearing and speaking, accompanied by swelling of their tongue in one, and possibly 2, of the reports above. Hospitalized patients were said to have elevated blood pressure and signs suggestive of raised intracranial pressure in one of the reports above.

The fact that all of the hospitalized patients seem to have developed the illness at about the same time suggests a poisoning. Methanol intoxication can cause severe acute visual dysfunction and death. Initial symptoms generally occur 12-24 hours after ingestion, but the incubation period may vary with the volume of methanol ingested. Headache, nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, and diminished visual acuity develop and in later stages, blindness and drowsiness occurs, which may progress to obtundation (altered level of consciousness) and coma. Quinine poisoning has also been reported to cause acute blindness (http://www.annemergmed.com/article/S0196-0644(87)80295-0/abstract). Acute dystonic reaction, with protrusion of the tongue, may occur as a reaction to some drugs, but this is not accompanied by loss of vision (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3793459/).

A discussion of methanol poisoning can be found in moderator TG's comments in ProMED-mail post Methanol poisoning, fatal - India: (UP) 20150113.3088258.

ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving additional information about this outbreak from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
