The Instituto Evandro Chagas confirms 9 more cases of Zika virus [infection] in Alagoas
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Evandro Chagas Institute (IEC) confirmed on Monday (31 [Aug 2015]) 9 more cases of Zika virus [infection] in Alagoas [state], with 1 case in Arapiraca, 7 in Maceio and 1 in Maribondo. With these cases, there is now a total of 13, added to the 4 registered previously, with 1 in the Colonia Leopoldina and 3 in Mata Grande.

The new confirmed cases are among the 156 samples sent from the Alagoas Central Laboratory to the Evandro Chagas Institute in Para, confirming the isolation of Zika virus in more than 3 municipalities in Alagoas. The samples were collected during the period 15 Jul-3 Aug [2015], according to information from the Superintentant of Health Surveillance of the State Secretary of Health, Cristina Rocha.

She indicated that the protocol of the Ministry of Health states that cases of Zika [virus infection] can only be confirmed after positive tests by the Evandro Chagas Institute, the reference laboratory for Alagoas. "The expansion [of the geographic range] of transmission of Zika virus to other municipalities was predictable, since it is transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_, the same vector for chikungunya fever and for dengue [viruses], which is present in 71 of the 102 municipalities in Alagoas," she said.

[As the above report indicates, it is not surprising to see the geographic range of Zika virus expanding in Alagoas state, and beyond the state to those areas in Brazil where dengue viruses are transmitted (most of Brazil) and then on to other countries.

Laboratory confirmation of Zika virus infections is critical because the symptoms are sufficiently similar to those of dengue and chikungunya virus infections that making a differential diagnosis is difficult on clinical grounds alone.
