17 people in Astrakhan have been diagnosed with measles. These cases
are the 1st after a 3-year break. The region was considered to be
measles-free; however, 8 adults and 9 children have been diagnosed
with measles recently. The local public health authorities consider
the cases to be imported cases, and blame the primary healthcare
system for a failure to maintain an adequate level of immunization in
the population.

Swiss federal health officials say the measles epidemic which broke
out earlier this year [2011] is still ongoing, although at a slower
pace. Officials registered 44 cases of measles in just 4 days,
Jean-Louis Zurcher, a spokesman for the Federal Office of Public
Health, told public television recently.

So far, there have been more than 600 cases of measles this year
[2011], mostly affecting the cantons of Geneva, Vaud, Graubunden,
Zurich and Bern. Last year [2010], there were only about 30 cases in
the 1st half of the year.

The peak of the epidemic occurred in April 2011, when 205 cases were
recorded, Zurcher said. He said 9 out of every 10 cases involve people
who were not vaccinated.

The International Red Cross said today [5 Jul 2011] that an outbreak
of measles had reached epidemic proportions in the Libyan city of
Sabha and has quickly spread [via returning migrant workers] to Chad.
The situation is difficult to control due to a shortage of medical
supplies and because it involves a nomadic population.

In a press conference today [5 Jul 2011] in Geneva, Paul Castella,
head of the delegation of the International Committee of the Red Cross
(ICRC) in Libya, said that the Tuareg tribe is the most affected
segment of the population because their nomadic way of life has
complicated routine vaccination [The Tuareg are a Berber nomadic
pastoralist people. They are the principal inhabitants of the Saharan
interior of North Africa. - Mod.CP].

Castella said that measles is the 2nd leading cause of child
mortality in Africa, after malaria, and warned that if the situation
is not controlled in Sabha, "it could become a catastrophe."

In addition, the ICRC delegate said that, at present, there is a food
crisis situation in Libya, and in the areas controlled by the
government, families are dependent on government subsides. Castella
said it is impossible to predict the outcome but stressed that his
organization "is closely monitoring developments to avoid an impending
crisis." In areas controlled by the Transitional Government, the
situation is more complicated because the authorities cannot, for
example, pay wages, and people are dependent on international aid. "In
Benghazi (the Libyan capital of the rebels), there is a clear effort
by the opposition to respond to the needs of the population," he
said.

The administrator of the interim territory of Kongolo, Gregory Ebondo
Mutombo, citing medical sources, announced the occurrence of a measles
epidemic at a place about 350 km on the rail route northwest of the
city of Kalemie, in Katanga province. The outbreak has caused the
deaths 6 children; hundreds of others are affected according to the
CPA.

The territorial authorities have asked the public to be more vigilant
and to take suspected cases to the local hospital for treatment. The 6
deaths occurred a week and a half ago in Kongolo. The epidemic has
also affected 230 other children under 3 years. A significant number
of the affected children live in the centre of Kongolo.

Fearing the spread of the disease, the administrator has urged
residents to cooperate with the nearest health facilities. Any
suspected case of persistent fever with the occurrence of a skin rash
should be referred to a local hospital without delay.

The Ministry of Health of Jalisco (SSJ) has declared a measles alert
as a consequence of the current epidemic in Europe and is advising all
persons aged one year to 39 years of age to be vaccinated.

Although Jalisco has had 16 years with no cases of measles, an
epidemic alert is warranted in the vicinity of the capital
Guadalajara, the location of the 2011 Pan American Games and various
other international events organised by the state, which will attract
foreign tourists. The Minister of Public Health, Mario Amezcua
Marquez, said that since last Friday's [1 Jul 2011] federal health
agency alert, surveillance and vaccination in the state had been
enhanced. The health official said that the measles vaccination rate
is high in Jalisco state, but those uncertain of their vaccination
status should seek vaccination.

The outbreak in Europe has affected 24 countries with about 6500
cases, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), affecting
adversely the prospects for global eradication of the disease. The
director general of the SSJ Public Health Department attributed the
problem to those European countries, such as France and Germany, that
do not have mandatory vaccination policies, a situation that must
change if the disease is to be eradicated.

In the Americas from January to May this year [2011], 336 cases have
been recorded in Canada, USA, Chile, Brazil, Panama, Dominican
Republic and Argentina, but none has occurred so far in Mexico.

[A similar alert was issued in the southern state of Tabasco on Thu 7
Jul 2010, likewise recommending travelers to the United States or
Europe to review urgently their vaccination status and seek
vaccination if appropriate. According to the Director of Preventive
Health Programs, Ramon de Jesus Velarde Ayala, measles had been
eliminated in Mexico for several decades, and vaccine coverage in the
Tabasco state exceeded 99.9 per cent. See the Milenio online report

The back-to-school push for children's vaccinations has new urgency
this year [2011] as Florida health officials report an alarming rise
in measles. So far this year, 7 cases have been reported in Florida,
the most in 14 years. All but one involved an unvaccinated child 1-16
years old. Most of the children's parents had exempted them from
state-required vaccinations by citing religious objections to
vaccines.

More and more parents in the Tampa Bay area and around Florida are
claiming such objections. But medical experts say they think the real
issue often is not religion, but unfounded fears of a connection
between vaccines and autism. Cost, they say, should never be a factor.
Parents who can't afford a doctor visit can take their children to
county health department clinics or to a back-to-school immunization
event. And insurance covers vaccinations.

"We would just encourage parents to start thinking now about what
their child needs for school and not to wait until the last minute,"
said Maggie Hall, spokeswoman for the Pinellas County Health
Department. Parents who wait until just before school starts may face
long waits for vaccines required for school. But the health community
is more concerned about the small but growing number of parents who
refuse vaccines for children.

The measles vaccine, which comes in a shot that also protects against
the mumps and rubella, has never contained thimerosal, the
preservative that generated particular concern in the vaccines debate
(although even thimerosal has been cleared of any autism connection).

Still, some parents don't appear convinced. In the past decade, the
number of Florida kindergarten students whose parents claim religious
exemptions has more than quadrupled, state records show. About 2400
kindergartners statewide have religious exemptions for the current
school year. Four of the 6 children in Florida who got the measles
this year [2011] had a religious exemption to the school immunization
requirement.

Given all the debate, the Catholic Diocese of St. Petersburg has
recently clarified the church's position. In a letter to pastors and
parochial school principals, Bishop Robert Lynch said the church does
not teach that using vaccines is "intrinsically evil," even if the
vaccine was produced with controversial stem cell lines. [As far as
this moderator is aware, no commercial MMR vaccine is produced in stem
cell cultures. - Mod.CP]. So Catholic schools shouldn't grant vaccine
exemptions on religious grounds.

Health experts fear that many people have forgotten just how bad
measles can be, since the vaccine has made the disease so rare [in the
Americas] in recent decades. Measles remains one of the most
contagious diseases, said Dr. Juan Dumois, chairman of infectious
diseases at All Children's Hospital in St. Petersburg. It can be
acquired by breathing in air in the vicinity of a measles patient
without being right next to him or her.

About 10 days after exposure, patients who contract the infection
start to develop a fever, cough, congestion and red eyes. The
tell-tale measles rash, which starts on the face and spreads to the
body, shows up 3 to 4 days later. Many doctors today struggle to
recognize the disease because they've never seen a case.

Most children recover in about a week, but some young patients will
stop eating and drinking, requiring hospitalization and intravenous
fluids. About one in 1000 develops a brain infection that can lead to
permanent neurological damage, if they survive, and one or 2 in 1000
die. "You never know when your child is going to be the one in 1000,"
Dumois said. "It's sort of like playing roulette, hoping that your
child won't be the one who suffers, if the argument is, 'Well, measles
isn't so bad in most of the children who get it.' And a stricken child
could pass the virus on to an elderly relative or someone else who
lacks a strong immune system. For them, the disease can be especially
dangerous."

So far this year [2011], almost all of the Florida cases were linked
to travel, as has been the case nationally. The 156 cases reported
this year by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
represent a 15-year high. With measles hot spots seen in Europe,
Africa, India and Southeast Asia, authorities recommend that U.S.
residents traveling overseas get immunized. That means 2 doses of the
measles vaccine for anyone one year or older, Dumois said, and one
dose for infants between 6 and 11 months. The travel advisory calls
for earlier immunizations than the typical schedule. Children usually
get their 1st measles shot at 12 to 15 months, with the 2nd at 4 to 6
years

Media release from Auckland Regional Public Health Service (ARPHS):
The latest update on measles cases is now at a total of 48 as of this
afternoon [Mon 4 Jul 2011]. Those numbers may rise during the week
[Another report released on the following day increased the number of
cases by one. - Mod.CP].

Auckland Regional Public Health Service (ARPHS) Medical Officer of
Health, Dr Richard Hoskins, says it is important to stress that
measles is a serious and highly infectious disease that makes people,
including infants, very sick. "The only way to stop you from catching
measles is getting immunised. The vaccination is funded for children,
young people and unimmunised adults."

"These new cases have been in several early childhood centres, and we
are now working with those centres to quarantine susceptible contacts
at home in case they develop measles," says Dr Hoskins. "We strongly
advise that all children should receive 2 doses of the MMR (measles,
mumps, rubella) vaccine at 15 months and 4 years. We also strongly
advise catch up vaccinations for adolescents and adults who have had
either none, or only one dose, of the MMR vaccine, particularly if
they are intending to travel overseas."

ARPHS advises that common symptoms of measles include a runny nose,
cough, sore eyes and fever, followed by a raised red rash that starts
on the face and moves to cover the rest of the body. "Anyone
displaying symptoms of measles should immediately telephone their
doctor, or Healthline on 0800 611 116, for advice. It is important to
call 1st because measles is highly infectious, and people with it can
infect others in the waiting room," says Dr Hoskins. "Prompt
identification can help limit the spread of measles to others,
particularly vulnerable groups within the community," says Dr
Hoskins.
