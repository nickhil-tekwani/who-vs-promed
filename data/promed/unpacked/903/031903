Texas Department of State Health Services is recommending precautions
after 2 Texas residents developed hantavirus pulmonary syndrome this
year [2007]. One person, a Jefferson County resident, died. The other
person, a Crosby County resident, recovered.
Hantavirus is carried by certain species of rats and mice. The
illness is rare. Infected rodents shed the virus in their urine,
droppings and saliva. The virus can be transmitted to people when
infected rat or mouse urine, saliva, droppings or nesting materials
are stirred up, temporarily aerosolizing the virus, which can be
breathed in by humans.

A Mono County man was diagnosed with the 1st case of hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome in California this year [2007], the state
Department of Public Health said Wednesday [11 Jul 2007].
Authorities said they did not know how the man was exposed to the
often deadly virus but said he had completely recovered since he fell
ill late last month [June 2007]. The man's age was not released
because officials said it could be used to identify him in the
sparsely populated Eastern Sierra county.
The disease is transmitted through the urine, droppings or saliva of
infected rodents, especially deer mice. People contract hantavirus by
breathing in the dried particles infected with the virus.

Symptoms include fever and muscle aches, possibly with chills,
headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and cough, and
tend to develop one to 6 weeks after exposure.

With the recent news that a Mono County man was diagnosed with
hantavirus, the San Diego Health and Human Services Agency and the
Department of Environmental Health Vector Control is encouraging the
public to take precautions when entering enclosed spaces frequented
by wild rodents.
"Hantavirus is rare, but it can be deadly," said County Public Health
Officer Dr. Wilma Wooten. "People can become infected after opening
up vacation homes or when cleaning rooms or buildings that have been
empty for a long time. Proper cleaning techniques are important."
To reduce the risk of hantavirus infection, do not vacuum, sweep or
dust areas for 30 minutes after opening doors and windows. When
cleaning rooms or buildings, wet the surfaces with disinfectant (for
example, a 10 percent bleach solution) before cleaning.
"The virus has been found in wild rodents in San Diego County in
recent years," said DEH Director Gary Erbeck. "Infected rodents shed
the virus in their droppings, urine and saliva."
The last known human case of hantavirus in San Diego County occurred
in the Campo area in 2004.
Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is caused by a virus carried by wild
rodents, primarily deer mice. People who live in rural or suburban
areas near undeveloped land are at higher risk from mice entering
their homes. People most commonly become infected when they stir up
and inhale airborne particles of contaminated rodent droppings, urine
and saliva. The virus can also be spread by touching the mouth and
nose after handling infected rodents or contaminated objects.
The 1st signs of illness are similar to flu symptoms and include
fatigue, fever and muscle aches. They can also include headache,
dizziness, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain.
Later symptoms of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome include coughing,
shortness of breath rapidly progressing to severe difficulty in
breathing, and sometimes death. There is no specific treatment, so
prevention is important.

A previously well, non-smoking 50 year old First Nations (American
Indian) man was transferred to the University of Alberta Hospital
from a northern Alberta community (latitude 58.37=B0, close to the
border with the Northwest Territories) because of progressive hypoxia
of 5 days duration in spite of 3 days of treatment with oral
azithromycin. The patient denied any recognized contact with mice.
He was profoundly hypoxic (pCO2 30.6, pO2 40.3). His haemoglobin was
normal at 139, wbc was normal at 8.9, but with a left shift (13
percent bands, 4 percent myeloid forms). ALT and AST were mildly
elevated at 64 and 95 respectively. A chest x-ray showed diffuse
interstitial changes with some features suggestive of pulmonary edema
and a small pleural effusion. Blood cultures and sputum examination
revealed no other pathogen (except NASBA positive for parainfluenza
virus in sputum).
He was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics. For about 48 hours he
required high flow oxygen by reservoir mask and there was concern
about a possible need for intensive care, but his pulmonary gas
exchange improved over the subsequent 2-3 days and he was discharged
to his local hospital where he ultimately made a full recovery.
Hantavirus serology undertaken at the National Microbiology
Laboratory, Public Health Agency of Canada in Winnipeg on an acute
blood sample taken 5 days post-onset of symptoms revealed IgM ELISA
titres of 1/1600 and IgG titres of 1/400 [presumably to a hantavirus
antigen. - Mod.TY].
A detailed investigation by a health inspector from First Nations and
Indian Health Branch (SS) revealed 1) that the patient had not
travelled outside of his northern community within the possible
incubation period of his illness, 2) the most likely source was felt
to be a shed in the patient's yard which was found to contain mouse
droppings. 3) the patient's home and workplace were found to be
unlikely sources of infection.
Alberta has had the largest number of cases of pulmonary hantavirus
syndrome of the Canadian provinces. This is the most northerly human
case of this disease recorded in Canada to date (approximately 285 km
[177 miles] north of Eaglesham which had been the furthest north case
seen prior to this case). However hantavirus infected deer mice have
been detected as far north as the southern Yukon Territory (Personal
communication. Harvey Artsob, National Microbiology Laboratory). We
are not aware of reports of Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome from other
northern areas in Asia or Alaska.
Discussion:
It is unclear whether this case simply reflects increasing
recognition of the geographic range of this uncommon and recently
recognized disease, or whether its range is expanding. The over
representation of First Nations (aboriginal) people continues to be
apparent in Alberta, perhaps explained by their increased risk of
environmental exposure.
