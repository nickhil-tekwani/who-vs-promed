[For additional background information, including diagnostic methods, and references, please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2015, Chapter 2.8.5 Porcine brucellosis, at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.08.05_PORCINE_BRUC.pdf from which the following commentary is quoted:

"Brucellosis in pigs is caused by _Brucella suis_, a bacterial infection that, after an initial bacteraemia, causes chronic inflammatory lesions in the reproductive organs of both sexes, with occasional localisation and lesions in other tissues. The species _Brucella suis_ consists of 5 biovars, but the infection in pigs is caused by _B. suis_ biovars 1, 2, or 3. The disease caused by biovars 1 and 3 is similar, while that caused by biovar 2 differs from 1 and 3 in its host range, its limited geographical distribution, and its pathology.

Biovar 2 is rarely pathogenic for humans, whereas biovars 1 and 3 are highly pathogenic causing severe disease.

Porcine brucellosis is of widespread occurrence; generally, however, the prevalence is low, with the exception of South America and South East Asia where the prevalence is higher. In some areas, _B. suis_ infection has become established in wild or feral pigs -- diagnostic methods recommended for wild and feral pigs are the same as for domestic pigs. Various biovars of _B. suis_ cause infections in animals other than pigs, such as reindeer, caribou, hares and various murine species, and occasionally in cattle and dogs.

Signs of disease in sows include infertility and abortion at any stage of gestation, and birth of dead or weak piglets. In boars, the most prominent sign is orchitis, and the secondary sex organs may be affected. _Brucella suis_ may be present in the semen, sometimes in the absence of clinical signs. Transmission during copulation is more common than is the case with brucellosis in ruminants. In both sexes, bones and especially joints and tendon sheaths may be affected, causing lameness and sometimes paralysis.

In humans, the infection is usually confined to those who are occupationally exposed to pigs, and to laboratory workers. The capability of _B. suis_ to colonise the bovine udder with subsequent shedding in milk, has the potential to be a serious human health risk." - Mod.CRD
