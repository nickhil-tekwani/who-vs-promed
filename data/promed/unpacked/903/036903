The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) confirmed 3 more cases of Ebola and recorded 2 new deaths in the ongoing outbreak in North Kivu province.

Two of the new cases and both deaths occurred in Beni, the hotspot of the outbreak that saw violent attacks by rebel forces over the weekend [20-21 Oct 2018]. One new case was recorded in Butembo.

There are now 247 cases in the outbreak, including 159 deaths. 48 suspected cases are still under investigation.

DRC officials said vaccination is once again underway after being halted due to the violence and subsequent protests in Beni. Vaccination rings in Mutwanga and Kalunguta also ended, as all expected targets in those towns have been vaccinated. A total of 21 553 in the eastern DRC have been vaccinated during this outbreak with Merck's unlicensed Ebola vaccine.

In other news, Peter Salama, MD, the deputy director-general for emergency preparedness and response at the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Twitter that the Beni is also experiencing an acute malaria outbreak, with 2000 cases diagnosed each week. According to Salama, the WHO will be organizing an age-targeted mass drug administration campaign.

[2000 malaria cases diagnosed each week dwarfs Ebola. Malaria is among the principal causes of morbidity and mortality in the DRC, accounting for 39% of all outpatient visits and for 39% of deaths in 2014. Given that the majority of the population lives in high transmission zones, it has been estimated that the DRC accounts for 9% of all malaria cases and 10% of all malaria deaths in sub-Saharan Africa (excerpted from https://www.pmi.gov/docs/default-source/default-document-library/malaria-operational-plans/fy-2018/fy-2018-democratic-republic-of-the-congo-malaria-operational-plan.pdf).
