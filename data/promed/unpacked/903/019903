In less than a week, that Kentucky-centered outbreak of the rare _E. coli_ O103 has exploded to 44 cases in the Bluegrass State and spread to Tennessee, Ohio, and Georgia, the Minneapolis-based Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) reports. As recently as last Friday (29 Mar 2019), the Kentucky case count stood at 24.

CIDRAP, headed by Dr. Michael Osterholm, PhD, MPH, University of Minnesota Regents Professor, and McKnight Presidential Endowed Chair in Public Health, reported on the escalating outbreak on Wednesday [3 Apr 2019]. The CDC in Atlanta has yet to issue a public report on the expanding multistate outbreak. CIDRAP reported that Dr. Mel Bennett, manager of the Infectious Disease branch of Kentucky's Department of Public Health suspects the source of the _E. coli_ O103 is beef, chicken, or sliced American cheese.

Six of the 44 infected Kentuckians have required hospitalization. _E. coli_ O103 is far less common than the O157: H7 strain, which often causes foodborne disease illnesses. Bennett also said the outbreak has spread to at least the 3 other states and that Kentucky health officials are in daily contact with CDC.

Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services spokesman Doug Hogan says cases are spread across several counties, with 5 confirmed in Fayette County. Hogan says some sort of food distribution service may be the root cause. Some early reports indicated fast food might be the source of the contamination. At least 20 additional cases are being investigated by Kentucky public health officials. In addition to Tennessee, Ohio, and Georgia, Indiana is also a possible location for infections.

Symptoms of _E. coli_ O103 illness typically include stomach cramps and diarrhea, including bloody diarrhea. People generally become ill 2-5 days after consuming contaminated food. _E. coli_ O103 disease sometimes leads to hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), a severe complication that can cause kidney failure; HUS can occur a week or more after the onset of diarrhea.

_E. coli_ O103 outbreaks are rare. The last large one was almost 20 years ago. In January 2000, a total of 18 people fell ill after attending a banquet in Washington state. Their infections were ultimately linked to drinking punch served at the banquet hall. At least one victim is known to have developed HUS.
