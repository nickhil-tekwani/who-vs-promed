The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health and US Forestry Service officials have closed the Broken Blade, Twisted Arrow, and Pima Loops of the Table Mountain Campgrounds in the Angeles National Forest, after tests confirmed that one ground squirrel trapped on 16 Jul 2013 during routine surveillance activities tested positive on 23 Jul 2013 for plague, according to a health advisory [notice] issued on Wednesday [24 Jul 2013].

The campgrounds are expected to be closed for a week while the squirrel burrows in the area will be dusted for fleas and further testing of squirrels is performed.

"Plague is a bacterial infection that can be transmitted to humans through the bites of infected fleas, which is why we close affected campgrounds and recreational areas as a precaution while preventive measures are taken to control the flea population," said Jonathan E Fielding, director of public health and health officer. "It is important for the public to know that there have only been 4 cases of human plague in Los Angeles County residents since 1984, none of which were fatal."

Health officials advise that individuals visiting recreational areas near the Broken Blade, Twisted Arrow, and Pima Loops of the Table Mountain Campgrounds need to take certain precautions to avoid contact with wild animals that could be carrying plague-positive fleas.

Visitors to recreational areas should not feed wild animals, not leave edible trash out where wild animals can get to it, avoid camping or picnicking in the immediate vicinity of ground squirrel burrows, and should avoid taking pets into areas where they could be exposed to fleas. If you must take your pet into areas with fleas, please ensure that your pet has appropriate flea control and vaccinations, as recommended by a veterinarian.

Plague is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_. It is found in animals throughout the world, most commonly in rats, but also in other rodents like ground squirrels, prairie dogs, chipmunks, rabbits and voles. Fleas typically serve as the vector of plague. Human cases have been linked to domestic cats and dogs that bring infected fleas into the house.

Bubonic plague is the most common form of plague. In this form, the bacteria typically enter the body through the bite of an infected flea or rodent. The bacteria then infect the lymphatic system. After a few days to week, the person will experience fever, chills, weakness, and swollen lymph glands. These are called buboes. Untreated, bubonic plague is fatal about half the time.

_Yersinia pestis_ is treatable with antibiotics if started early enough. Members of the public who see dead ground squirrels in recreational areas, or who want more information about precautions, should contact the LA County Department of Public Health, Vector Management Program at (626) 430-5450.

[Plague, caused by _Yersinia pestis_, is enzootic among rodents in the western USA. Humans can be infected through 1) the bite of an infected flea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals; 2) direct contact with contaminated tissues; or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of respiratory secretions from infected people or animals.

Plague is a potential bioterrorism agent. Human infections are rare but can be life-threatening. The case fatality rate of plague depends on the clinical presentation (that is, bubonic, septicemic, or pneumonic) and timing of initiation of antibiotic therapy; if untreated, the case fatality rate is over 50 per cent for bubonic plague and approaches 100 per cent for pneumonic plague (1). Rapid laboratory identification can help guide therapy.

Domestic cats and dogs can also contract plague from infective fleas. They may carry infected fleas home to their owners or, especially with cats, serve as a direct source of infection. There are many flea treatments and repellents appropriate for pets available. Some products may be suitable for dogs but not cats or may be suitable for an adult but not a younger animal. Be sure to consult your veterinarian, as some products may be toxic to cats, kittens, and puppies, even resulting in fatalities.

Clinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front leg (the armpit, if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever. Please take your pet to a veterinarian if you notice any abnormalities.

Veterinarians should protect themselves by wearing gloves when examining these swellings. A bubo that ruptures may infect the veterinarian or even the pet owner if the pet owner is the one palpating the swelling.

Another form of the disease is the respiratory form. Cats may acquire this form and can spread it to their owners or the veterinarians through infected expiratory droplets. People are also prone to the respiratory infection.

You should also be aware that the fleas that hitchhike into your home on a pet can also transmit disease to you, the owner or caretaker of the pet. Sleeping in the same bed with dogs has been associated with plague in enzootic areas (2). Plague patients with no history of exposure to rodents can be infected by _Y. pestis_ if their pets carry infected rodent fleas into the home. Veterinarians always should recommend flea control to dog and cat owners.
