Residents of 2 blocks in Nadia, Haringhata, and Chakdah, are reeling
under the grip of viral fever.

Mr Amulya Mondol, panchayat [local government body] pradhan
[ministerial title] of Hingnara-I panchayat in Chakdah said:
"Hundreds of villagers have been suffering from the viral fever for
the last 2 weeks and panic has gripped the residents of the Hingnara
panchayat, with the disease casting its shadow on almost every
household. Those suffering from high fever are also experiencing
excruciating joint pain. About 10 of the seriously ill patients have
already been admitted to the Kalyani JNM hospital."

In Haringhata block, hundreds of residents in Dighalgram, Parulia,
Sia, Mahadevpur, and Anandapur areas have also been suffering from
viral fever. "We are keeping a close watch on the situation. From the
reports, which we have received from our medical teams, the villagers
are suffering from high fever. I have sent medical teams to each of
these areas to combat the situation. The medical team has collected
10 blood samples from [individuals in] each affected area and they
have been sent to the School of Tropical Medicine (STM) for the
tests. Currently, the situation is under control and our doctors are
camping at the affected areas," Dr Mrinal Kanti Biswas, [chief
medical officer of health,] added.

"The primary reason behind this is the frequent fluctuation in
temperature and humidity levels. Different types of virus become
active and spread rapidly in such climatic conditions. Almost 40
percent of patients admitted in the JNM Hospital are suffering from
viral fever," said Dr Nirupam Biswas, superintendent of the Kalyani
JNM Hospital.
