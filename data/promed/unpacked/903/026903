Dutch export ban imposed as 'new strain' of bluetongue is found
---------------------------------------------------------------
The Dutch Ministry of Agriculture has imposed an export and breeding
ban on animals susceptible to bluetongue [virus (BTV)] after a
possible new strain of the disease was discovered.

A total of 3 animals on different farms in eastern Holland tested
positive for a form of bluetongue, which differs from the strain
usually found in the country.

Dutch scientists have begun investigations into whether the strain is
a variant of BTV8, the strain being vaccinated against in the UK, or
new type of the virus.

As a precautionary measure, the Dutch farming minister imposed an
export ban on bluetongue-susceptible animals from yesterday (20 Oct
2008)

Under the move, which is initially in place for 2 weeks, producers
are also banned from breeding sheep, cattle, and goats.

The ministry said it would make a further decision over the ban once
more was found out about the strain.

Dutch farming organisation LTO [Dutch Organisation for Agriculture
and Horticulture] told Farmers Weekly's sister paper Boerderij that
it supported the export ban.

"Given the pressure from abroad and the worrying situation we are in
because we don't know what is going on, this measure is appropriate,"
a spokesman said.

"The measure will cause economic damage, but sometimes there are
larger interests at stake."

Minister of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality (LNV), Verburg, has
adopted as a precautionary measure with effect from 20 Oct 2008, at
18.00, an export ban on breeding and production animals susceptible to
bluetongue disease, such as cattle, sheep, and goats.

The Central Veterinary Institute (CVI) has detected in 3 different
farms in Eastern Netherlands a virus, which is not similar to the
BTV-8 serotype known to prevail in the Netherlands. The CVI has
determined that it is not the serotype BTV-1, which is present in
France.

Further investigations will be carried out in cooperation with the EU
reference laboratory in the UK, to find if this is a variant of the
BTV-8 or a new type of the bluetongue virus.

The affected holdings are blocked and the Food and Consumer Product
Safety Authority (VWA) is sampling all cattle on the premises for
further investigations.

As a precaution, the minister has decided to set up an export ban.
This measure applies only to ruminants, such as cattle, sheep. and
goats, and is further limited to breeding and production animals. It
does not affect animals for slaughter.

The measure will be effective as of 20 Oct 2008 at 18:00 and will
apply until more information becomes available about the virus type,
for a period of up to 2 weeks.

[The Dutch precautionary measure -- banning exports of breeding and
production ruminants until the completion of the strain's
identification -- is commendable.

The Farmers Weekly article (item 1 above) includes also information on
Dutch producers "banned from breeding sheep, cattle, and goats." This
is a rather exceptional measure, not mentioned in the official press
release. Confirmation (with duration of applicability) or otherwise
will be helpful. If confirmed, such step could be explained by the
wish of the Dutch authorities to prevent later difficulties in the
export of pregnant animals due to risk of fetal viraemia, in view of
the cases of infected offspring born in importing countries (see
ProMED-mail postings 20080306.0916, 20080308.0948, and
20080408.1294).

In our previous posting on the suspected new variant in the
Netherlands, (archive no. 20081018.3301), we erroneously attributed
the report to the Dutch daily Algemeen Dagblad. The source should
have instead read Agrarisch Dagblad, a daily newspaper, which has
been most helpful to ProMED-mail on several occasions. - Mod.AS]
