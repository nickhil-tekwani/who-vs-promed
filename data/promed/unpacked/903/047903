[According to information obtained from the WAHID database, in 2012 Russia reported an event of FMD serotype O. A total of 2 outbreaks were reported, both located in Primorsky Krai [federal subject of Russia]. See the report at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=11712

The WRLFMD (Pirbright) web page shows that during July and August 2010, FMDV type O was isolated from samples which originated from the Zabaykalsky Krai -- see http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2010/WRLFMD-2010-0000Q%20O%20Russia%202010.pdf and http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2010/WRLFMD-2010-0000R%20O%20Russia%202010.pdf.

Vaccination was applied both as a response and control measure to address this outbreak of FMD serotype O. This information was included in Russia's follow-up report to the OIE for the FMD serotype A outbreak in this same region. See http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=14761. Details of the type of vaccine used were not given. This information would be useful and hopefully included in any future follow-up reports.
