Our zoo in Australia is planning to sponsor the donation of backyard
fowl to a community in rural Zimbabwe. Could anyone provide us with
information regarding incidence/prevalence of H5N1 in the region and
the estimated risk such a programme would represent?

[No official information about Zimbabwe's HPAI (highly pathogenic
avian influenza) situation has been published by the national
authorities nor distributed by the OIE (World Organisation for Animal
Health) since February 2006. Generally, the animal health situation
there -- and its reporting -- seem to leave ample room for improvement.
Responses to Natalie's request will be welcomed. - Mod.AS]
