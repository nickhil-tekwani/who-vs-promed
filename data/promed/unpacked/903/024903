"Please stop infecting each other."

That's the message Harvard University has for students after a mumps outbreak left 40 people sick over the past 2 months. The university first announced mumps cases in February [2016], and infections have steadily increased despite efforts to isolate patients.

Paul J Barreira, director of the Massachusetts university's health services, told the student newspaper that the rise in cases is worrying. "I'm actually more concerned now than I was during any time of the outbreak," Barreira told The Harvard Crimson. "I'm desperate to get students to take seriously that they shouldn't be infecting one another."

Mumps is spreading so fast, it could affect the university's [26 May 2016] commencement, he said. "If there's a spike this week, that means those students expose others, so now we're looking at a potential serious interruption to commencement for students," Barreira told the student newspaper. "Students will get infected and then go into isolation."

Last month [March 2016], the public health department in Cambridge, where Harvard is located, said all students affected had been immunized against mumps before they contracted it.

Mumps is a viral infection that causes swelling in the salivary glands and cheeks, earache, jaw pain, and general symptoms such as fever, muscle aches, and headache. The virus can be transmitted through respiratory droplets and contact with saliva or mucus. Most mumps patients completely recover.

[When last reported by ProMED-mail (Mumps - USA (10): (IN,MA) student cases 20160415.4162668), there were 19 confirmed and 30 suspect cases of mumps on the Harvard University campus as of 29 Mar 2016. We are now told in the news report above there are a total of 40 cases, but we are not told how many of these are confirmed or suspected.

Mumps outbreaks even among vaccinated populations have been reported frequently during recent years, especially among college students where the intensity of exposure among students was presumed to have overcome the vaccine-induced immunity (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/20/4/13-1681_article.htm).

For a discussion of mumps, see my comments in ProMED-mail post Mumps - USA: (OH) university students 20140308.2321285.

Harvard University is a private research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts (US), with 6700 undergraduate and 14 500 postgraduate students (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University).
