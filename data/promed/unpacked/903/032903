In the wake of outbreak of anthrax in Hukumpeta and G Madugula mandals [similar to counties] in the agency area of Visakhapatnam district, the Animal Husbandry department has initiated preventive measures to contain spread of the disease further.

Nearly 20 veterinary teams have been deployed in the region to take up vaccination and decontamination work.

In a release, the department authorities stated that samples from soil and the 2 dead animals were collected and sent to the Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory in Visakhapatnam and also Veterinary Biological Research Institute in Hyderabad for further investigation. The Defence Research and Development Establishment which has also collected samples from the dead animals confirmed the presence of anthrax [bacterium]. "Soon after the confirmation, we have deployed the teams comprising 60 members to cover 77 villages in Hukumpeta and G Madugula mandals. As on Friday evening [6 May 2016], the vaccination was completed in 20 villages and efforts are on to cover all the 77 villages by Sunday evening [8 May 2016]," said joint director V Venkateswara Rao.

[Good. Anthrax is a disease better and more cost effectively handled proactively than reactively. The veterinary authorities are wise to take the vaccination programme out to surrounding villages as this disease is under-reported by livestock owners. There will be other herds affected and at risk. And by preventing this disease in livestock it automatically prevents humans from being exposed and infected. By having been slack a significant number of people became sick and were hospitalised for treatment. And there would have been those exposed and receiving antibiotics to head off any possible incubating infection. Humans are expensive to treat. Now the veterinary authorities know of a real problem in this area, they would be wise to revisit twice more, in 2017 and 2018, and revaccinate these herds. And keep checking for unexpected deaths. - Mod.MHJ
