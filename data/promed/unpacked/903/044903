Enhanced surveillance for invasive meningococcal disease has been performed
by the National Reference Laboratory (NRL) for Meningococcal Infections in
the Czech Republic since 1993, when a new meningococcal strain C:2a:P1.2,5
belonging to ET-15/37 complex emerged and [and was associated with
increased morbidity and case fatality rates.
For this reason, it was easy to search for W135 strains after
W135:2a:P1.2,5 emerged in association with haj pilgrims in 2000. In the
Czech Republic, 2 cases of invasive meningococcal disease caused by
W135:NT:NST occurred in 2000, and the strains did not belong to ET-37 complex.
The NRL for Meningococcal Infections has monitored meningococcal strains in
the Czech Republic since 1970. Only 29 W135 strains of _Neisseria
meningitidis_ have been identified in the period 1974-2001 (5 from invasive
meningococcal disease, 17 from healthy carriers, 7 from respiratory
disease). Only one strain from the whole period was of ET-37
(W135:2a:P1.2). This was isolated from cerebrospinal fluid of a patient in
1995, before the "haj episode" began. This strain was submitted to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, recently. The [other
4 W135 meningococcal strains from patients with invasive meningococcal
disease do not belong to ET-15/37 and show the phenotype W135:NT:NST. One
was isolated in 1982, one in 1984, and 2 in 2000.
