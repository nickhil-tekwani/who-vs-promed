PLUM ISLAND, N.Y. -- An improved vaccine for foot-and-mouth disease (FMD)
is at least 3 years off, so the United States would likely fight the virus
the same way Britain has, say US scientists bracing for the possible arrival
of the livestock infection.
The scientists, said officials probably would impose restrictions on
infected farms and require the slaughtering of infected farm animals and the
burning or burying of carcasses.
The US has been free of FMD since 1929 and any outbreak would cost the
country about $20 billion in lost trade and to pay for methods to stop the
spread of the virus, according to U.S. government estimates.
The current vaccine is an acceptable vaccine but it may not have all of the
attributes we are hoping to have in a vaccine, said microbiologist Peter
Mason, head of the US Department of Agriculture's (USDA) FMD research center
on Plum Island, a restricted, government-run laboratory about 120 miles east
of New York City.
Mason said veterinarians needed a vaccine that acted faster and also made it
possible to pinpoint the difference between vaccinated animals and animals
infected with the virus. The vaccine now available takes several days to
take effect. Current [accepted tests are unable to distinguish between
cattle, sheep and pigs which have been vaccinated and those which have the
disease.
US agriculture officials and farmers fear the highly contagious disease,
which can be transported on clothing and carried by the wind, could easily
reach the US [from Europe -- but not on the wind. - Mod.JW
Proposals to vaccinate herds in Britain have been controversial, with
farmers saying livestock buyers could shun immunized cattle, which may still
carry the disease because injections only mask the clinical signs of FMD.
Veterinarian Thomas McKenna, head of the Plum Island center's foreign animal
disease eradication effort, said a vaccination program would be only one of
the options open to authorities should FMD hit the United States.
Our initial response is going to be very similar to how the UK handled it,
McKenna said. You stop movement on infected farms; you destroy those
animals by burying or incinerating them; your whole goal is to reduce the
spread, and since infected animals are the cause of the spread, you have to
reduce the number of infected animals.

[Nowhere do we see any official concern that:
(a) Vaccination is not an option in the USA -- except for breeding stock --
since vaccine stocks are not adequate to cover the needs in an outbreak;
(b) Stopping movement from infected farms will always be, to coin a phrase,
a case of closing the barn door after the cow has gone;
(c) Once the virus gets into the wild deer population, all attempts at
control will be useless.
