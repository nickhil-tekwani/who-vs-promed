Eosinophilic meningitis in tourists - Jamaica
------------------------------------------------
[A recent study reported that] a 2000 outbreak in tourists visiting
Jamaica of eosinophilic meningitis [was] due to _Angiostrongylus
cantonensis_ [and that the parasite was recently] found in rats and
snails on the island. Overall, 22 percent (24/109) of rats harboured
adult worms, and 8 percent (4/48) of snails harboured _A.
cantonensis_ larvae. This report is the first of enzootic _A.
cantonensis_ infection in Jamaica, providing evidence that this
parasite is likely to cause human cases of eosinophilic meningitis.
The paper describe how 12 persons in a group of 23 U.S. tourists who
visited Jamaica for a week developed eosinophilic meningitis within
6-30 days (median 11) of returning home. Though 9 persons required
hospitalisation, there were no deaths. There was serologic evidence
of exposure to _A. cantonensis_ in 8 persons who had eaten salad at
the same restaurant, a common exposure that might account for all
cases.

[The study has been published in Emerging Infectious Diseases and
describes the study of the animal reservoir of Angiostrongyliasis in
Jamaica. Eating uncooked snails, prawns, crabs or vegetables
transmits Angiostrongyliasis. The natural reservoir is rodents. -
