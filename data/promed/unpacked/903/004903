Hendra virus claims horse in north Queensland
---------------------------------------------
Authorities have confirmed another horse has died from the Hendra
virus, this time in far north Queensland. 30 other horses have been
quarantined on the property west of Cairns.

Queensland's chief biosecurity officer Dr Jim Thompson says the
animal that died yesterday morning [12 Jul 2011] has tested positive
to the disease.

"This afternoon we've had confirmation of our 4th Hendra case in
Queensland," he said. "This case is a little bit different than the
others in that it's in north Queensland, west of Cairns.

"The story is that on Sunday [10 Jul 2011] a horse was sick and it
was visited by a vet, samples were taken, the horse was depressed,
wobbly, and showed neurological symptoms, and the horse died yesterday
morning [12 Jul 2011].

"Samples were received at the Biosecurity Queensland laboratories
yesterday and testing today has confirmed that it is positive for
Hendra virus."

The property runs horse riding and quad bike tours. Dr Thompson says
the situation is in its early days, but Biosecurity Queensland
officers will be passing on more details as they come to hand.

"We've only just found out this information this afternoon [13 Jul
2011], so we're moving to the property and quarantining the property
this afternoon and we'll make an assessment of the issues at that
property," he said.

Queensland's chief medical officer, Dr Jeannette Young, says she is
not sure how many people have come into contact with the horse. "We're
working very closely with Biosecurity Queensland and we've got some of
our medical staff going out to the property as we speak," she said.

"Until they've been out there and they've spoken to the owner and
spoken to the people, they really won't know how many people have been
in contact."

In a statement, [the owner of the property] said his brother and 4
staff had contact with the animal that died and are undergoing tests.

Spate of outbreaks
------------------
If the virus is transferred to humans, the risk of death is very
real. Of the 7 people who have contracted Hendra in the past, 4 have
died.

But with awareness among vets growing, more are regularly wearing
masks and gloves to treat sick horses. "I understand that yes, the vet
was fully appropriately kitted in PPE [personal protective equipment],
but again that's very preliminary early information that we need to go
and confirm," Dr Young told PM.

It is common for Hendra to appear in winter but this year [2011] has
seen more cases than usual.

There have been 3 outbreaks in south east Queensland, 2 in northern
New South Wales, and now the 1st case in the far north in 7 years.

Researchers do not know what is causing the increased number of
outbreaks and a vaccine is still a year away. Dr Thompson says there
is concern about more incidents occurring.

"Obviously there's events going on at the moment that seem to make it
more likely to occur at this time of year than it has in the past," he
said. "We're obviously continuing to monitor those and we'll follow
this closely as the others."

He stresses that wherever the virus has appeared, it has been
contained.

But with 17 people undergoing tests already and about 40 horses being
monitored it has prompted the Queensland and New South Wales state
governments to launch a joint taskforce.

The taskforce will hold its 1st meeting tomorrow [14 Jul 2011].

Reducing the risk
-----------------
Take the following steps to reduce the risk of people and horses
becoming infected with Hendra virus. This advice is based on our
current understanding of the virus.

- It is strongly advised that you avoid contact with sick horses and
their blood and body fluids until a veterinarian has excluded Hendra
virus infection as the cause of illness.
- If contact with a sick horse is absolutely unavoidable you should
seek advice from your veterinarian about appropriate personal
protective equipment such as gloves, protective eyewear and a face
mask.
- If you have had contact with sick horses, shower with soap, wash
your hair, and put on clean clothes and footwear before handling other
horses.
- Remove any clothing contaminated with body fluids from a sick horse
carefully to ensure there is no contact with your facial area,
particularly your eyes, mouth, and nose.
- After handling any horse, wash your hands with soap and water and
dry, or use hand wipes and waterless hand hygiene solution.
- Place horse feed and water containers under cover if possible.
- Do not place horse feed and water containers under trees,
particularly if flying foxes are attracted to those trees.
- Do not use feed that might be attractive to flying foxes if they
are known to be in the area. Fruit and vegetables (such as apples,
carrots) or anything sweet (such as molasses) may attract flying
foxes.
- If possible, remove horses from paddocks where flowering/fruiting
trees have resulted in a temporary surge in flying fox numbers. Return
the horses after the trees have stopped flowering/fruiting.
- If it is not possible to remove horses from paddocks, try to
temporarily remove your horses during times of peak flying fox
activity (usually at dusk and during the night).
- Keep any sick horse isolated from other horses, people and animals
until you have obtained a veterinarian's opinion.
- Do not allow visiting horse practitioners (farriers, etc.) to work
on sick horses. They should only work on healthy horses. If there is
more than one horse on your property, handle unaffected horses first
and then only handle sick horses after taking appropriate
precautions.
- Make sure gear exposed to any body fluids from horses is cleaned
and disinfected before it is used on another horse. This includes
things like halters, lead ropes, and twitches. Talk to your vet about
cleaning agents and disinfectants to use.
- Seek veterinary advice before bringing any sick horse onto your
property.
- Do not take sick horses to events such as competitions or pony
club.

NSW DPI [New South Wales Department of Primary Industries] advises
horse owners to take precautions in areas with flying foxes to reduce
the risk of their horses becoming infected:

- Place feed and water containers under cover.
- Do not place feed and water under trees, especially trees with
fruit.
- Do not use feed that could attract flying foxes, such as apples,
carrots, or molasses.
- If possible, remove horses from paddocks where flowering trees have
temporarily attracted flying foxes.
- If removing horses is not possible, take horses out during times of
peak flying fox activity, usually at dusk and during the night.

I would have thought that the taskforce would already have convened.
I guess the notice regarding a taskforce was information that one was
being formed, not that it had been formed and was preparing to meet.

The information on keeping yourself and your horse safe seems like
common sense, but it is so easy to overlook small steps of protection
when it is you and your beloved horse.

Horse owners, veterinarians, and biosecurity workers are at extra
risk and need to be especially diligent to protect themselves and
their animals. - Mod.TG]
