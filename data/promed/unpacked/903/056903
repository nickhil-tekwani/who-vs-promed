SARS: availability and use of laboratory testing
------------------------------------------------
Researchers in several countries are working towards developing fast and
accurate laboratory tests for the SARS [virus]. Until those tests have been
adequately field tested and shown to be reliable, however, SARS diagnosis
depends on the clinical findings of an atypical pneumonia not attributed to
another cause and a history of exposure to a suspect or probable case of
SARS or their respiratory secretions and other bodily fluids. This
requirement is reflected in the current WHO case definitions for suspect or
probable SARS. Several countries (Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong SAR
[China], Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the
United States of America) are, nonetheless, testing samples for suspected
and probable SARS cases in research settings.
Interpretation of test results
------------------------------
Positive test results: Positive test results indicate that SARS patients
are, or recently were, infected with the SARS virus. Specificity of the
different tests still needs to be established.
Negative test results: A negative SARS virus test does not mean that the
patient does not have SARS. The reasons for negative test results in a
patient with SARS include the following:
(1) The patient is not infected with the SARS virus; the illness is caused
by another infectious agent (virus, bacterium, fungus) or non-infective cause;
(2) Test results are incorrect ("false-negative"). Current tests need to be
further developed to improve sensitivity;
(3) Specimens were not collected at a time when the virus or its genetic
material was present (pertains to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cell
culture). The virus and its genetic material may be present for a brief
period only, depending on the type of specimen tested; and
(4) Specimens were collected early in the course of the illness and before
antibodies had been produced (pertains to enzyme linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) and immunofluorescence assays).
Sampling for research: To enhance the future understanding of the SARS
disease process, WHO recommends that clinicians collect and store
sequential samples from patients with SARS for testing when diagnostic
tests become readily available. This is particularly important for the
first case(s) recognized in countries that have not previously reported
SARS. Guidelines on sample handling of suspected or probable SARS patients
can be found at the web site of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), United States of America.
Status of laboratory tests currently under development
------------------------------------------------------
(1) Antibody tests:
-- ELISA detects antibodies in the serum of SARS patients reliably as from
day 21 after the onset of clinical symptoms and signs.
-- immunofluorescence assays detect antibodies in serum of SARS patients
after about day 10 of illness onset. This is a reliable test requiring the
use of fixed SARS virus, an immunofluorescence microscope, and an
experienced microscopist. Positive antibody tests indicate that the patient
was infected with the SARS virus.
(2) molecular tests (PCR):
PCR can detect genetic material of the SARS virus in various specimens
(blood, stool, respiratory secretions, or body tissue). Primers, which are
the key pieces for a PCR test, have been made publicly available by WHO
network laboratories on the WHO website. The primers have since been used
by numerous countries around the world. A ready-to-use PCR test kit
containing primers and a positive and negative control has been developed.
Testing of the kit by network members is expected to quickly yield the data
needed to assess the test's performance in comparison with primers
developed by other WHO network laboratories.
Existing PCR tests are very specific but lack sensitivity. That means that
negative tests can't rule out the presence of the SARS virus in patients.
Various WHO network laboratories are working on their PCR protocols and
primers to improve their reliability.
Laboratories performing SARS-specific PCR tests should adopt quality
control procedures and identify a partner laboratory in their country or
among the WHO collaborating research laboratories to cross-check their
positive findings.
Laboratories performing SARS-specific PCR tests should adopt strict
criteria for confirmation of positive results, especially in low-prevalence
areas, where the positive predictive value might be lower. The PCR
procedure should include appropriate negative and positive controls in each
run, which should yield the expected results:
(a) a negative control for the extraction procedure and a water control for
the PCR run;
(b) a positive control for extraction and PCR;
(c) an inhibition control -- the patient sample spiked with a weak positive
control to detect PCR inhibitory substances.
If a positive PCR result has been obtained, it should be confirmed by:
(a) Repeating the PCR starting from the original sample; OR
(b) Having the same sample tested in a second laboratory.
Amplifying a second genome region could further increase test specificity.
(3) Cell culture:
Virus in specimens (such as respiratory secretions, blood, or stool) from
SARS patients can also be detected by infecting cell cultures and growing
the virus. Once isolated, the virus must be identified as the SARS virus
with further tests. Cell culture is a very demanding test but is the only
means to show the existence of a live virus.

[As noted previously (SARS - worldwide (64): etiology 20030423.0996),
diagnostic results reported from the Canadian National Microbiology
Laboratory in Winnipeg contradict those reported earlier from Hong Kong.
The Hong Kong team found that 90 per cent of probable SARS cases harbored
the SARS-associated coronavirus, and found no trace of it in healthy
controls. None of 40 respiratory secretions from patients with other
respiratory diseases contained evidence of coronavirus RNA, and none of 200
serum samples from blood donors had serum antibody to this new coronavirus
(SARS - worldwide (34): etiology 20030408.0857).
By contrast (see the Mod. comment included as part of SARS - worldwide
(67): cases 20030424.1007), the Canadian group detected SARS-associated
coronavirus in about 20 per cent of 250 people who were not suspected of
having SARS, but who were tested because they had come to Canada from
affected areas in Asia or who had mild symptoms not thought to be SARS
(that is, a slightly biased control group).
This discrepancy urgently needs to be resolved, as it casts doubt on the
sensitivity, specificity, and relevance of the current diagnostic
procedures. Inclusion of an unbiased control group of patients should be
part of the protocol for the evaluation of the currently available
laboratory tests in the diagnosis of SARS. - Mod.CP]
