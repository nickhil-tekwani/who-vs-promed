No new cases of cholera in Armenian village
-------------------------------------------
Text of report by Armenian news agency Noyan Tapan Yerevan,
24 Sep 1998:
Since 24 September there have been no new cases of cholera in the
village of Zartonk in Armavir Region while many patients have
recovered and been discharged from hospital, the head of the
Armenian Health Ministry's department for hygiene and
epidemiological control, Artsrun Vanyan, told a Noyan Tapan
correspondent.
Vanyan said that as of 23rd September approximately 13 per cent
of the former number of cholera patients and those in contact with
them (285 people) were in hospital. "They are mainly elderly people
who want to be treated for illnesses other than cholera from which
they were already suffering," the head of department said.
