Two more new human cases of avian influenza have been confirmed for the H5N1 virus in Cambodia, bringing the number of cases to 16 so far this year [2013], a joint statement by the World Health Organization and the Cambodian Health Ministry said on Tuesday [13 Aug 2013].

The statement said that one case is a 9 year old boy from north western Battambang Province, who was admitted to the Jayavarman VII Hospital in Siem Reap with fever, cough, vomiting, abdominal pain, and dyspnea [difficulty breathing] on 4 Aug 2013, and was confirmed positive for human H5N1 avian influenza on Friday last week [9 Aug 2013]. "The boy is currently in a stable condition," the statement said.

The other case is a 5 year old girl from Southern Kandal Province who was admitted to Kantha Bopha Hospital in Phnom Penh on Friday last week [9 Aug 2013] with fever, cough, sore throat, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and dyspnea, and she was confirmed positive for human H5N1 avian influenza a day later. "The girl was treated with Tamiflu and is currently in a critical condition," it said.

The 2 patients touched dead or sick poultry before they became sick, the statement said. Avian influenza H5N1 remains a serious threat to the health of all Cambodians, Health Minister Mam Bunheng said. "Children also seem to be most vulnerable and are at high risk because they like to play where poultry are found," he said in the statement. "I urge parents and guardians to keep children away from sick or dead poultry and make sure children wash their hands with soap and water after any contact with poultry."

Avian H5N1 influenza is a virus that normally spreads between sick poultry, but it can sometimes spread from poultry to humans, the statement said, adding that it is a very serious disease that requires hospitalisation. Cambodia has seen the worst outbreak of the virus this year [2013] since the disease was 1st identified in 2004. To date, the country has recorded 37 human cases of the virus, killing 28 people. This year, only 5 out of the 16 cases survived.

Globally since 2003, there have been 636 laboratory confirmed human cases of H5N1 virus with 377 related deaths, the statement said.

[The confirmation of these 2 cases represents the 15th and 16th cases of human H5N1 infection in Cambodia during 2013 and increases the total number of cases of human H5N1 in Cambodia to 37 since 2004, including 28 deaths. This is the 1st confirmed case of human infection in Battambang province. There was one prior case of human infection with H5N1 confirmed in Kandal province in 2008.

During the period January through March 2013, there have been 4 outbreaks of H5N1 in backyard flocks of poultry reported to OIE in Cambodia involving 3 provinces: Takeo, Kampong Cham (2 outbreaks), and Kampong Speu (see http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public%5C..%5Ctemp%5Creports/en_fup_0000013142_20130315_133056.pdf for more details).

More information on these newly confirmed cases (such as age, gender, history of contact with avians, history of known avian die-offs geographically close to locations where cases have been, clinical status) would be appreciated.
