Aventis Pasteur Voluntarily Recalls Four Lots of Rabies Vaccine
------------------------
Aventis Pasteur today announced it is recalling four lots of ImovaxÂ®
Rabies, Rabies Vaccine (Human Diploid Cell) that were distributed in the
U.S. This is a precautionary measure stemming from the discovery through
routine testing of a non-inactivated production strain of virus in a single
product lot, which was not distributed. As a special safeguard, Aventis
Pasteur initiated the voluntary recall in the U.S. and abroad of
distributed rabies vaccine lots produced during the same time period. The
lots being recalled passed all release tests, including testing to confirm
the absence of live virus.
All purchasers and distributors of vaccines from the recalled U.S. lots
(X0667-2, X0667-3, W1419-2, and W1419-3) are being notified. The four lots
were distributed from September 23, 2003 through April 2, 2004. Health care
providers will notify any recipients of the recalled vaccine of next steps,
which may include the recommendation that some individuals receive
additional doses of vaccine and, if appropriate, rabies immune globulin.
"Safety is our paramount concern," said Michael D. Decker, MD, MPH, vice
president for scientific and medical affairs at Aventis Pasteur. "This
voluntary recall is in accordance with our longstanding policy of
exercising the utmost precaution in matters of public health."
Rabies is a viral infection that is mainly a disease of animals. Humans get
rabies when bitten by infected animals. There are two groups of people who
receive the rabies vaccine series:
1. People considered at high risk of exposure to rabies -- including
veterinarians, animal handlers and certain laboratory workers -- are
periodically vaccinated against the disease.
2. People who may have been exposed to rabies are given the vaccine
post-exposure, along with Rabies Immune Globulin (RIG).
Individuals who believe they might have received vaccine from the recalled
U.S. lots (X0667-2, X0667-3, W1419-2, and W1419-3) since September 23, 2003
should contact their health care provider or Aventis Pasteur for further
information. The company has set up a special toll-free number, 1-800-835-3587.
Aventis Pasteur is dedicated to providing our customers with vaccines of
the highest purity, potency and safety, and is fully committed to
addressing this matter.

[While this press release mentions 4 lots of rabies vaccine for recall in
the USA, ProMED-mail is aware from another listserve that different lots
(X0712-1 or X0071-6) were being recalled in Ireland. We have been unable to
confirm this latter information at present, but as soon as we are able to
get further information on this recall we will post a clarification.
According to the recall notices, a non-inactivated production strain of
virus was identified in a single product lot (that had not been
distributed) which was produced at the same time as the lots being
recalled. Again, according to the press release, the lots being recalled
had passed all release tests including confirmation of no live virus in the
released lots. There are no recommendations for management of individuals
already vaccinated with the lots being recalled. Should further
information become available we will post accordingly. - Mod.MPP]
