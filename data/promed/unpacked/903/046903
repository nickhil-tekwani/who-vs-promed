Through our work over the last few years we have treated cheetah (Masai
Mara) and Gorilla (Bwindi Uganda) with Ivomec against _Sarcops scabeii_ by
blow pipe remote injection with success. We do note however the incidence
appears to be related to possible stress factors - seasonal drought and
exposure to excessive numbers of tourists!
[The cheetah dose was 300 micrograms per kg body weight ... Mwanzia et
al., Outbreak of sarcoptic mange in Cheetah in the Masai Mara Kenya, in
Proceedings of the American Association of Zoo and Wildlife Veterinarians,
pp. 105-111, Michigan, 1995.
For gorillas please contact Gladys Kalema in Uganda at the Uganda Wildlife
Authority as she will have a record of the dosing - I recall it was 200
micrograms per kg - but we did not have accurate body weights on this
occasion.
You have a problem.
