[The majority of the 163 outbreaks are located in
Nordrhein-Westfalen, followed by Rheinland-Pfalz and only a few in
Hessen, all states in the western part of Germany.
Again, it is worth emphasizing the large number of outbreaks
contained in this outbreak --163 affected farms. Over 80 were
reported in the previous follow up update (no. 2), while there were
23 farms in the 1st update and only 6 in the original notification
report for this outbreak in Germany on 20 Jul 2007. This totals 272
herds in Germany alone. Clearly, it is worth plotting an epidemic
curve for the outbreak, both by country and for the region as a whole.
The website of the Institute of Animal Health, Pirbright
(<http://www.iah.bbsrc.ac.uk/bluetongue/>) provides a regional map
and the following number of outbreaks:
Netherlands: 336 infected holdings
(<http://www.agd.nl/Algemeen/Artikel/Nederland-20-kilometerzone.htm>
(in Dutch) as of 22 Aug 2007);
Belgium: 408 infected holdings
(<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=5961>
as of 23 Aug 2007);
France: 37 infected holdings
(<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=5970>

Luxembourg: 4 infected holdings
