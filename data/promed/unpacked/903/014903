A bat that was found on the ground in the 2400 block of E Orman Ave [in Pueblo, Colorado] has tested positive for the illness.

It's unknown if any people came in contact with that bat. Anyone who suspects they had contact with the bat should call the Pueblo City-County Health Department at 719-583-9901.

"It is not normal to see a bat during daytime, and especially unusual to see a bat on the ground," said Sylvia Proud, Public Health Director at the Pueblo City-County Health Department. "This is an example bats may be in all areas of Pueblo, not just old houses, barns, and rural areas."

Rabies is caused by a virus transmitted by the bite of an infected animal. Bat teeth are very small and sharp; a wound from a bat bite may not be visible. Rabies also can be transmitted by a scratch or if the animal's saliva gets into a cut or break in the skin. Just seeing the bat or being in the area, without any physical contact, is not a risk.

This is the 1st animal to be confirmed with rabies in Pueblo County this year [2015]. Rabies has been found in wild skunks, foxes, and bats throughout Pueblo County in past years. Pet and livestock owners are highly encouraged to vaccinate animals against rabies through a licensed veterinarian. "Un- or under-vaccinated dogs and cats that are exposed to rabies have an extremely high chance of getting infected and dying from the disease. These pets also pose a tremendous risk to humans because they can bring rabies into the home," Proud said.

A Pueblo Pet Check event will be held [Sat 9 May 2015] at the Colorado State Fair Grounds, for more information contact Pueblo Animal Services (719) 544-3005.

To avoid exposure to rabies:
- Never touch a bat or any other wild animal. A healthy bat likely will not come near enough to be touched, so a bat that is slow, lying on the ground, or that falls from a tree could be showing signs of illness. If you can touch the animal, chances are it is sick. Children who find a bat should leave it where it is and tell an adult.
- Do not pick up a bat with your hands, even if you're wearing gloves. Use a shovel and double trash bags to pick up the bat, careful not to smash or damage the head area.
- If you are bitten by a bat or if you suspect you've been exposed to its saliva, try to contain the bat without touching it (see previous sentence), and contact your local animal control agency or health department so the bat can be tested.
- Make sure your pets are vaccinated against rabies.

[2] Maryland (Anne Arundel County): bat

The Anne Arundel County Department of Health said it has issued a rabies alert after a bat tested positive for rabies. Officials said the bat was found [Wed 6 May 2015] at 413 Hideaway Loop [Glen Burnie, Anne Arundel County, Maryland].

They said in a news release that animals with rabies can spread the disease through a bite or scratch, or if infected saliva touches a person's eyes, nose, mouth, or broken skin.

Officials advise pet owners to keep rabies vaccinations current for their dogs, cats and ferrets.

While not all bats carry rabies, officials said anyone who had contact with a bat or has seen a bat in a room with someone sleeping, someone intoxicated, or a child should call the Department of Health at 410-222-7256.

[3] Alabama (Madison County): bat, possible human exposure

Huntsville officials are warning people not to touch wild animals after the unusual discovery of a rabid bat on Alabama A&M [Agricultural and Mechanical] University campus.

A woman found the sick Indiana bat
[_Myotis sodalis_ see photo http://naturalhistory.crowspath.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/indiana-bat-11.jpg]
inside a campus building on [27 Apr 2015] and drove it to Huntsville Animal Services. Shelter Director Dr Karen Hill Sheppard said she euthanized the bat and sent it to the Alabama Department of Public Health for tests.

The tests came back positive for rabies on [30 Apr 2015]. State health department statistics show this is the 1st confirmed rabies case in Madison County since 2011. That case and another in 2009 both involved bats.

Rabies is more prevalent in other parts of Alabama. There were 76 confirmed rabies cases statewide in 2014, primarily in raccoons, bats, and foxes. St. Clair County led the state with 13 rabies cases.

The woman who found the rabid bat at Alabama A&M was instructed to seek care from her doctor because she had touched the animal. She has not developed any signs of rabies.

Rabies can be transmitted if the saliva of an infected animal comes in contact with a person's mouth, eyes, nose, or any open wound on the skin. The most common animals associated with rabies are the bat, fox, raccoon, and skunk.

"It is important that people do not handle any wild animals, especially animals that seem sick or disoriented," said Sheppard.

Genetic evidence suggests that rabies is an old disease for bats in the New World. Bats from most of the estimated 41 bat species in the United States, when sampled in sufficient numbers, have been found to be infected with rabies virus. Rabies viruses recovered from bats were shown to be distinct from rabies viruses recovered from terrestrial mammals, suggesting that these viruses evolved within their bat hosts. Bat rabies viruses of bats are genetically diverse, exhibiting mutations characteristic to each host bat species.

Transmission rarely occurs between species, and these "spillover events" generally are not perpetuated in the recipient species.
