While heavy damage to the cardamom crop has seen prices rise by 10 to 15
per cent over the past 3-4 weeks, farmers in the southern state of Kerala
feel the current price rise may not help them as they have "very little" to
offer for sale.
Extreme summer weather during the April-May [2007] season and the
unprecedented rains and storms that followed during the June-August [2007]
period, the main harvest season, has resulted in widespread damage, with
the production drop estimated at around 45 per cent. The damage is severe
in areas such as Vandanmedu, Anavilasam, Sasthanada, and Nedunkandam of the
Idukki district, Kerala, where the cultivation of cardamom is widespread
and intensive.
To make matters worse, the crop was affected by a fungus outbreak in areas
such as Vandanmedu and Anavilasam, with farmers failing to control the
disease. In most cases, the disease destroyed the plants completely.
According to farmers, the high moisture content in the atmosphere because
of the rains had helped the growth of this fungus.
K K Devassya, the general secretary of the Cardamom Growers Association
(CGA), told Business Standard that in most of the cardamom growing areas of
the Idukki district, especially in places such as Udumbanchola and
Kattappana, crop damage had upset the financial position of farmers.

[Cardamom (_Elettaria cardamomum_; also called small, lesser, true,
Malabar, or green cardamom) is an Indian native belonging to the ginger
family (_Zingiberaceae_) growing in tropical areas. Its dried fruit is one
of the highly prized spices in the world.
A number of fungal diseases are known to affect cardamom. _Phytophthora
meadii_ and related species affect seed capsules, which rot and decay
(called "azhukal"). Infections occur during the rainy season and may also
spread to the panicles. _Pythium aphanidermatum_, _P. vexans_,
_Thanatephorus cucumeris_ (previously _Rhizoctonia solani_), and _Fusarium
oxysporum_ cause clump or rhizome rots. The affected shoots become brittle
and easily break off from the rhizome at the bulbous base. _Phaeodactylum
venkatesanum_ causes leaf blotch disease. Irregular lesions turning
necrotic are observed mainly on mature leaves. A disease caused by
_Glomerella cingulata_ (previously _Colletotrichum gloeosporioides_) has
also been reported.
Fungicides are used to manage these diseases and biological control methods
are being developed. It is not clear from the story above which of these
fungi are responsible for the damage to the current crop in Kerala, or why
fungicides were ineffective.
There is also a large, or black, cardamom (_Amomum subulatum_;
_Zingiberaceae_) native to the Eastern Himalayas, inhabiting cool, moist
forest areas. It is a commercial crop in other parts of India (Darjeeling
hills), Bhutan, and Nepal.
