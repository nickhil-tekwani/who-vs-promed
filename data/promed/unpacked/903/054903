Rabid dogs bite 12 inhabitants of Moscow suburbs
------------------------------------------------
During the holiday period at the beginning of 12 May 2011, 12 people
in the suburbs of Moscow were bitten by rabid dogs: 10 were residents
of the Naro-Fominskiy district, and 2 were residents of the Istrinskiy
district. Another 6 people were bitten in Dedenevo village in
Naro-Fominskiy district, and 4 were in contact with a sick cat in the
village of Babukino in the Naro-Fominskiy district. Another 2 peoples
were bitten by a sick dog in the Istrinsky district. In each situation
the animals were confirmed to be rabid by laboratory diagnosis.

In April 2011 a 39-year-old woman died from rabies in Moscow. In
December of 2010 another woman who had visited Goa, and had been
bitten by a stray puppy on 29 Dec 2010, failed to seek medical
treatment on return to Moscow and died from rabies in the middle of
April.

Previously in November and December 2010, 2 persons died from rabies
virus infection in Moscow. In addition a 10-year-old girl was bitten
by a raccoon dog in Astrakhan where she was staying with her parents.
Also in August 2010 a 23-year-old local man, who had been bitten by
cat in Moldova, died in Moscow where he had gone to seek employment.

During the 1st 5 months of 2011 some 50 cases of rabies in animals
have been recorded in the Moscow region. By comparison in 2010 there
were 153 cases and 260 cases in 2009.

The Moscow region is surrounded by natural foci of rabies. The most
unfavorable locations are the Lotoshinskiy, Ruzsky, Istrinsky, and
Dmitrovsky districts. The main vectors include foxes, raccoon dogs,
and domestic animals (dogs and cats). More rarely rabies has been
recorded in elk, beaver, hedgehog and polecat. An unfavorable
situation remains in 3 districts which directly impinge on the Moscow
region -- the Krasnogorsky, Leninsky and Odintsovsky districts where
rabies continues to be prevalent. However since 2008 no rabid animals
have been recorded in Moscow [city].
