A 65-year-old Franklin County man is in intensive care at Virginia
Mason Medical Center in Seattle [Washington] after being diagnosed
earlier this week with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a health
official said Wednesday [15 Aug 2007].
The man is the 5th confirmed case of hantavirus in the
Benton-Franklin Health District this year [2007], and the 3rd in the
past week [week of 5 Aug 2007], according to Dr. Larry Jecha, the
Benton-Franklin Health District medical director.
The district usually doesn't hear of more than one case of hantavirus
per year, Jecha said, so the health district has warned local health
service providers to be on the lookout for symptoms. They include
fatigue, fever and muscle aches in the early stages, and later
coughing and shortness of breath, according to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention website. The virus can be fatal.
"We're alerting people to be careful around droppings," Jecha said,
because the virus is transmitted through rodent urine, droppings and
saliva, particularly those of deer mice [_Peromyscus maniculatus_].
He said the increase in hantavirus cases locally may be because more
mice may be carrying the virus.
People catch the virus when they breathe contaminated air, typically
caused by sweeping or cleaning in areas likely to contain droppings,
such as barns, attics or garages, according to the CDC.
The 2 other cases reported this week were family members, women aged
45 and 24. They also are from the Benton-Franklin county area. The
24-year-old was admitted to an area hospital Tuesday [14 Aug 2007],
Jecha said, while the other woman was treated at a hospital and
released. Another 2 cases were reported in the area in June [2007],
Jecha said, adding that the rest of the state has not reported any
incidents of the virus this year [2007].
Hantavirus 1st appeared in the United States in 1993. Since then, 465
cases have been reported nationwide, including 35 in Washington,
according to the CDC. About a 3rd of the cases around the country
have resulted in death.
