Researchers are reporting results of a study that substantially
alters the existing understanding of how the influenza virus evolves,
and which could have important implications for monitoring changes to
the virus and predicting which strains should be used for flu
vaccine. The study, which [was] published in the online journal
Biology Direct on Thu 26 Oct 2006, was conducted by researchers from
the National Library of Medicine's National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) and the Fogarty International Center, both part of
the National Institutes of Health.
In an effort to understand better how seasonal influenza evolves into
new strains, the researchers analyzed the genomic sequences of a
large and representative collection of the 2 most common flu strains
(called H3N2 and H1N1) from the 1995-2005 flu seasons in New York
state and New Zealand. The sequence data were obtained from the
Genome Sequencing Project, which recently generated over 1000 fully
sequenced influenza genomes from clinical isolates; the project is
funded and managed by the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases.
The analysis revealed a picture of flu evolution that was
surprisingly different from the prevailing conception of how the
virus changes. Evolution of influenza A virus is commonly viewed as a
typical Darwinian process. In this mode of evolution, the virus' main
surface protein, the hemagglutinin (HA), is thought to continually
change to evade human immune response, resulting in new dominant
strains that eliminate all competitors in a series of rapid
successions. Unexpectedly, however, the study found that the periods
of intense Darwinian selection accounted for only a relatively small
portion of H3N2 flu evolution during the 10-year period examined.
The study found that much of the time the H3N2 virus seemed to be "in
stasis"; that is, the HA gene showed no significant excess of
mutations in the antigenic regions (those recognized by the immune
system). During these stasis periods, none of the co-circulating
strains is significantly more fit than others, apparently because
multiple mutations are required to substantially improve the virus'
ability to evade the immune system. As a result, an increased variety
of strains accumulates. Ultimately, however, one of the variants will
come within one mutation of achieving higher fitness and becoming
dominant. Once the crucial last mutation does occur, virus evolution
shifts from stasis to a brief interval of rapid Darwinian evolution,
where the new dominant virus rapidly sweeps through the human
population and eliminates most other variants.
Based on their results, the researchers conclude that, "the common
view of the evolution of influenza virus as a rapid, positive
selection-driven process is, at best, incomplete." Because the
periods of stasis allow the proliferation of many small groups of
related viruses, any of which could become the next dominant virus
strain, the authors suggest that sequencing much larger numbers of
representative isolates could be helpful in augmenting current
surveillance methods.
The study, titled "Long Intervals of Stasis Punctuated by Bursts of
Positive Selection in the Seasonal Evolution of Influenza A Virus,"
is authored by Yuri Wolf, PhD, NCBI; Cecile Viboud, PhD, Fogarty
International Center; Edward Holmes, PhD, Fogarty International
Center and Pennsylvania State University; Eugene Koonin, PhD, NCBI;

[The abstract of Biology Direct paper entitled: Long intervals of
stasis punctuated by bursts of positive selection in the seasonal
evolution of influenza A virus by Y Wolf et al., reads as follows:
"BACKGROUND: The interpandemic evolution of the influenza A virus
hemagglutinin (HA) protein is commonly considered a paragon of rapid
evolutionary change under positive selection in which amino acid
replacements are fixed by virtue of their effect on antigenicity,
enabling the virus to evade immune surveillance.
RESULTS: We performed phylogenetic analyses of the recently obtained
large and relatively unbiased samples of the HA sequences from
1995-2005 isolates of the H3N2 and H1N1 subtypes of influenza A
virus. Unexpectedly, it was found that the evolution of H3N2 HA
includes long intervals of generally neutral sequence evolution
without apparent substantial antigenic change (stasis periods) that
are characterized by an excess of synonymous over nonsynonymous
substitutions per site, lack of association of amino acid
replacements with epitope regions, and slow extinction of coexisting
virus lineages. These long periods of stasis are punctuated by
shorter intervals of rapid evolution under positive selection during
which new dominant lineages quickly displace previously coexisting
ones. The preponderance of positive selection during intervals of
rapid evolution is supported by the dramatic excess of amino acid
replacements in the epitope regions of HA compared to replacements in
the rest of the HA molecule. In contrast, the stasis intervals showed
a much more uniform distribution of replacements over the HA
molecule, with a statistically significant difference in the rate of
synonymous over nonsynonymous substitution in the epitope regions
between the 2 modes of evolution. A number of parallel amino acid
replacements -- the same amino acid substitution occurring
independently in different lineages -- were also detected in H3N2 HA.
These parallel mutations were, largely, associated with periods of
rapid fitness change, indicating that there are major limitations on
evolutionary pathways during antigenic change. The finding that
stasis is the prevailing modality of H3N2 evolution suggests that
antigenic changes that lead to an increase in fitness typically
result from epistatic interactions between several amino acid
substitutions in the HA and, perhaps, other viral proteins. The
strains that become dominant due to increased fitness emerge from low
frequency strains thanks to the last amino acid replacement that
completes the set of replacements required to produce a significant
antigenic change; no subset of substitutions results in a
biologically significant antigenic change and corresponding fitness
increase. In contrast to H3N2, no clear intervals of evolution under
positive selection were detected for the H1N1 HA during the same time
span. Thus, the ascendancy of H1N1 in some seasons is, most likely,
caused by the drop in the relative fitness of the previously
prevailing H3N2 lineages as the fraction of susceptible hosts
decreases during the stasis intervals.
CONCLUSIONS: We show that the common view of the evolution of
influenza virus as a rapid, positive selection-driven process is, at
best, incomplete. Rather, the interpandemic evolution of influenza
appears to consist of extended intervals of stasis, which are
characterized by neutral sequence evolution, punctuated by shorter
intervals of rapid fitness increase when evolutionary change is
driven by positive selection. These observations have implications
for influenza surveillance and vaccine formulation; in particular,
the possibility exists that parallel amino acid replacements could
serve as a predictor of new dominant strains."
This analysis challenges some prevailing assumptions about the
evolution of influenza viruses and influenza disease. In particular
the evolution of influenza A virus appears to be spasmodic rather
than progressive. Periods of evolutionary stasis are not solely a
characteristic of avian influenza viruses as previously supposed.
This analysis also explains why -- in the history of human influenza
pandemics -- the appearance of a new strain has sometimes been
accompanied by eclipse of a preceding strain. Perhaps the immediate
challenge with regard to predicting the evolution of a new pandemic
influenza virus will be to identify the selective force(s)
determining the switch from stasis to progressive antigenic change. - Mod.CP]
