[1] AstraZeneca vaccine trial on hold
Date: Tue 8 Sep 2020
Source: The New York Times [edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/08/health/coronavirus-astrazeneca-vaccine-safety.html


The pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca halted large, late-stage global trials of its coronavirus vaccine on Tuesday because of a serious suspected adverse reaction in a participant, the company said. It is not yet known whether the reaction was directly caused by the company's vaccine or was coincidental.

The pause, which was first reported by STAT (https://www.statnews.com/2020/09/08/astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-study-put-on-hold-due-to-suspected-adverse-reaction-in-participant-in-the-u-k/), will allow AstraZeneca, a British-Swedish company, to conduct a safety review and investigate whether the vaccine caused the illness. How long the hold will last is unclear.

Drug companies are racing to complete a coronavirus vaccine that could bring an end to a pandemic that has already claimed more than 890 000 lives globally. AstraZeneca is a front-runner, with late-stage clinical trials underway around the world, and has said it hoped to have a vaccine ready before the end of the year [2020]. If the cause of the reaction turns out to be related to the vaccine, those efforts could be derailed.

Late-stage vaccine testing remains crucial, as large trials can turn up rare but serious side effects that would surface only if many thousands of people received a vaccine.

"This is the whole point of doing these Phase 2, Phase 3 trials," said Dr Phyllis Tien, an infectious disease physician at the University of California, San Francisco. "We need to assess safety, and we won't know the efficacy part until much later. I think halting the trial until the safety board can figure out whether or not this was directly related to the vaccine is a good idea."

President Trump has repeatedly pushed for the approval of a vaccine by Election Day, [3 Nov 2020]. On Tuesday [8 Sep 2020], 9 companies, including AstraZeneca, made a joint pledge to "stand with science" on coronavirus vaccines, reaffirming that they would not move forward with such products before thoroughly vetting them for safety and efficacy.

In a statement, AstraZeneca described the trial's halt, which was instituted voluntarily, as a "routine action which has to happen whenever there is a potentially unexplained illness in one of the trials, while it is investigated, ensuring we maintain the integrity of the trials."

The company said that in large trials like the ones it is overseeing, participants do sometimes become sick by chance "but must be independently reviewed to check this carefully."

The company said it was "working to expedite the review of the single event to minimize any potential impact on the trial timeline," and reaffirmed its commitment "to the safety of our participants and the highest standards of conduct in our trials."

A spokeswoman for the Food and Drug Administration declined to comment.

A person familiar with the situation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the participant who experienced the suspected adverse reaction had been enrolled in a Phase 2/3 trial based in the United Kingdom. The individual also said that a volunteer in the UK trial had received a diagnosis of transverse myelitis, an inflammatory syndrome that affects the spinal cord and is often sparked by viral infections. However, the timing of this diagnosis, and whether it was directly linked to AstraZeneca's vaccine, is still unknown.

Transverse myelitis can result from a number of causes that set off the body's inflammatory responses, including viral infections, said Dr Gabriella Garcia, a neurologist at Yale New Haven Hospital. But, she added, the condition is often treatable with steroids.

AstraZeneca declined to comment on the location of the participant and did not confirm the diagnosis of transverse myelitis. "The event is being investigated by an independent committee, and it is too early to conclude the specific diagnosis," the company said.

Some said the company's halt was evidence that the process was working as it should.

"At this stage, we don't know if the events that triggered the hold are related to vaccination," said Dr Luciana Borio, who oversaw public health preparedness for the National Security Council under Mr Trump and who was acting chief scientist at the FDA under President Barack Obama. "But it is important for them to be thoroughly investigated."

AstraZeneca's vaccine uses a viral vector that ferries coronavirus genes into human cells. The viral vector in this case is a modified chimpanzee adenovirus, altered to render it harmless to people. The coronavirus components of the vaccine are intended to spark a protective immune response that would be roused again should the actual coronavirus try to infect a vaccinated individual.

In a paper published in The Lancet in July [2020], researchers behind AstraZeneca's formulation reported that the majority of participants in the vaccine's Phase 1/2 trials, which are designed to assess the product's safety, had experienced some mild or moderate side effects, including muscle aches and chills. None of the reactions, however, were considered severe or life-threatening and resolved quickly. The vaccine was deemed safe enough to proceed to further testing.

AstraZeneca's vaccine is in Phase 2/3 trials in England and India, and Phase 3 trials in Brazil, South Africa, and more than 60 sites in the United States. The company intended for its US enrollment to reach 30 000 and started its American trials on [31 Aug 2020]

Phase 3 trials evaluate whether vaccine candidates protect people from infection or severe disease compared to a placebo.

Among FDA-approved vaccines, serious side effects are extremely rare. If identified in late-stage trials, these events can factor strongly in the agency's decision whether to greenlight a product.

AstraZeneca is one of 3 companies whose vaccines are in late-stage clinical trials in the United States. One of those companies, Moderna, said on Tuesday [8 Sep 2020] that the pause by AstraZeneca had not affected its own trial.

[The good news is that monitoring and evaluation systems for vaccine development are being adhered to strictly with safety a foremost concern. The potentially bad news may be the vaccine may have a serious side effect.

The media report above mentions that the illness is transverse myelitis -- an inflammation of the spinal cord. Known etiologies of this disorder include autoimmune disorders, direct viral diseases, and vaccines (a detailed discussion on transverse myelitis is available at https://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/patient-caregiver-education/fact-sheets/transverse-myelitis-fact-sheet).

We await further official information on the etiology of this individual's disease (if determined). - Mod.MPP]

[2] Bradykinin hypothesis

Bradykinin and the coronavirus
------------------------------
There's a new paper [see [B] eLife article below] that a lot of people are talking about recently that presents a rather large unifying hypothesis about the effects of the coronavirus (and suggests some new modes of treatment as well). This is the "bradykinin hypothesis", and before digging into it, it might be worth a paragraph to talk about what bradykinin is.

It's a 9-amino-acid peptide, and it's got a ton of biological activity. Bradykinin lowers blood pressure by dilating blood vessels, but it causes contraction of the smooth muscle in the lungs and in the gut. It's a diuretic in the kidney, and in the nervous system it's involved in the sensation of pain. Bradykinin receptors (there are 2 types) can signal to attract neutrophils (giving it a role in allergy and inflammation), and its pathways have also shown up in the functioning of several types of cancer cells. People taking angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are getting bradykinin effects as well because ACE is one of the enzymes involved in processing the larger precursor peptide down to bradykinin itself (as it does for angiotensin and its precursor).

That ACE part of the story is where this new paper comes in. The multicenter team behind it re-examined the composition of lung fluid collected from coronavirus patients and found that the disease lowered the amount of ACE and increased the amount of ACE2, which in fact, appears to increase by 200-fold (it's normally not found in high levels in lung tissue). Angiotensin II itself goes up by more than 30-fold, and renin (another enzyme involved upstream in the formation of angiotensin) and the 2 angiotensin receptors all go up several hundredfold.

These imbalances cause bradykinin levels to increase -- in fact, most of the proteins involved in bradykinin production and signaling are undetectable in such lung fluid under normal conditions, but go up sharply during coronavirus infection, while enzymes that are involved in bradykinin degradation go down. In the lung tissue, this new imbalance causes pain, dilated blood vessels, and increased vascular permeability. The bradykinin system also has complex links to blood coagulation, which could tie in with some of the observed coronavirus pathology in that area as well.

At the same time, another set of proteins seems to be similarly deranged: the ones involved with hyaluronic acid ([HA] also known as hyaluronan). That's a large carbohydrate polymer that's found throughout extracellular fluids -- in the joints, for example -- and it's involved with all sorts of wound repair, cell migration, and tissue surface effects. HA can be rather thick and slippery, and the authors believe that having it produced in excess in the lungs during coronavirus infection is a major factor in making things worse. In fact, its overproduction has already been associated (pre-pandemic) with respiratory distress, low oxygen levels, and even with some of the radiological findings ("ground-glass" opacities) that are also associated with coronavirus infection. As this new paper notes, though, HA has already been implicated as a player in coronavirus pathology.

So the authors are proposing a "bradykinin storm" model, where increased bradykinin levels tie into all sorts of coronavirus pathologies. The model fits many of these well, and also suggests other clinically observed features such as low potassium (hypokalemia) and low vitamin D. It's a very appealing theory, but it's also important to remember that a lot of very appealing theories in this business turn out not to be true. Or not completely true. Or not true in the ways that were originally thought. The way to find out is through clinical testing. To be honest, I'm worried that this proposal is almost too neat and form-fitting; rarely do you get something that falls together this well. It's also quite possible that you could come up with a reasonable set of literature references and previous reports that cast many of these connections into doubt -- the medical literature is large, and you can find support for a lot of things if you're putting together a brief for the prosecution. But overall, I find this work pretty plausible.

To that point, a very good feature of this work is that it immediately suggests several interventions with FDA-approved drugs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Neither the disease mechanism nor treatments for COVID-19 are currently known. Here, we present a novel molecular mechanism for COVID-19 that provides therapeutic intervention points that can be addressed with existing FDA-approved pharmaceuticals. The entry point for the virus is ACE2, which is a component of the counteracting hypotensive axis of RAS. Bradykinin is a potent part of the vasopressor system that induces hypotension and vasodilation and is degraded by ACE and enhanced by the angiotensin1-9 produced by ACE2. Here, we perform a new analysis on gene expression data from cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from COVID-19 patients that were used to sequence the virus. Comparison with BALF from controls identifies a critical imbalance in RAS represented by decreased expression of ACE in combination with increases in ACE2, renin, angiotensin, key RAS receptors, kinogen, and many kallikrein enzymes that activate it, and both bradykinin receptors. This very atypical pattern of the RAS is predicted to elevate bradykinin levels in multiple tissues and systems that will likely cause increases in vascular dilation, vascular permeability, and hypotension. These bradykinin-driven outcomes explain many of the symptoms being observed in COVID-19.

[Several comments were posted in response to the studies on the bradykinin hypothesis. 2 comments from the group follow regarding this eLife paper:

- "One major caveat of the eLife paper is that the COVID-19 samples and the control samples they compared them to were from 2 different populations (COVID-19: patients with severe disease from Wuhan, China, control: people recruited for a 2018 GSK study on obesity and asthma) and samples were processed by 2 different teams. This makes it difficult to interpret differences they observe between the 2 populations as they could be due to underlying differences between the populations unrelated to COVID-19 or technical differences in sample collection/preparation. Usually, one would like to see validation of the differences in an independent cohort where samples could be processed in parallel, but no such validation was done for the study. I agree with Derek that the data and underlying model they propose make sense and warrant further investigation, but it's also important to acknowledge the limitations of their study design."

- "In addition, it is important to keep in mind that they only measured RNA and not protein levels. You would think these would correlate, but very often they do not. So saying that, for example, ACE2 or angiotensin II go up x-fold is misleading since most readers will assume this means protein and that has not been shown in this work."

Both valid points. Nonetheless, the bradykinin storm addressed in the report above is very exciting as a unifying hypothesis for the myriad of symptoms SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals experience, and we look forward to follow-up studies. - Mod.LK]

'Bradykinin hypothesis' may explain how COVID-19 attacks the human body
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Scientists may be getting closer to answering a key question about the novel coronavirus -- and all it took was tying up the world's 2nd-most-powerful computer for 7 days. One of the many things yet to be understood about the virus is exactly how it is able to attack the human body in so many different ways and cause so many different symptoms, from persistent heart disease to the inability to smell and taste to the skin lesions that have been dubbed 'COVID toes'.

Early on in the pandemic, some doctors suggested the variety of symptoms could be explained as the work of cytokine storms -- processes in which the immune system overreacts to an infection. Cytokines are one of 3 types of molecules that the body produces in response to a virus or another invader. Normally, humans stop producing cytokines once the threat has been defeated. In a cytokine storm, however, the immune system keeps producing them -- and they end up attacking the organs they were meant to protect.

More recent research suggests that one of the other defender molecules may be the culprit. It's been dubbed the "bradykinin hypothesis," and it's gained steam ever since it was first theorized in the journal eLife in July [see above].

Using the Summit supercomputer at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee -- considered to be the 2nd-most-powerful computer in the world -- a team of researchers led by computational systems expert Dan Jacobson analyzed billions of genetic data points from the lung cells of 9 COVID-19 patients. It took Summit 7 days to sort through data that traditional desktop computers would have spent months dissecting. Jacobson said in a statement that he had a "eureka moment" when he noticed some "very distinct patterns" in the data from the patients' bradykinin systems.

While cytokines fight off infection by attracting white blood cells and ultimately regulating the body's temperature, bradykinins handle it via methods including inflammation. They're responsible for sneezes, coughs, stuffy noses, and other typical symptoms of influenza and the common cold. They're also able to dilate blood vessels, making them porous. Like cytokines, bradykinins can wind up in overdrive. Jacobson and his team say the genetic data from COVID-19 patients' lungs includes an abundance of enzymes that can trigger the production of bradykinins and unexpectedly few enzymes that can break it down -- what they described as the perfect conditions for a bradykinin storm, allowing for fluid to build up around the lungs. "Immune cells that are normally contained in the blood vessels flood into the surrounding infected tissue, causing inflammation," Jacobson said.

If this is happening in the lungs, the researchers theorize, it could also be taking place in other parts of patients' bodies, causing everything from muscle pain, to nausea, to diarrhea as blood vessels leak due to the "out-of-control cascade" of bradykinin production. If bradykinin storms are in fact responsible for some of the complications experienced by COVID-19 patients, then at least 10 existing drugs could be repurposed to treat those patients, Jacobson said, although only after extensive clinical trials.

[If further studies confirm this hypothesis, the bradykinin blocking drugs already in existence may pave the way for a marked improvement in treatment options for post severe presentations but possibly also preventively. A key question remains as to why some individuals have severe manifestations and others have mild or totally asymptomatic presentations. Where are the genetic studies...? - Mod.MPP]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Large in-person gatherings without social distancing and with individuals who have traveled outside the local area are classified as the "highest risk" for COVID-19 spread by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Between [7 and 16 Aug 2020], nearly 500 000 motorcycle enthusiasts converged on Sturgis, South Dakota for its annual motorcycle rally. Large crowds, coupled with minimal mask-wearing and social distancing by attendees, raised concerns that this event could serve as a COVID-19 "super-spreader." This study is the first to explore the impact of this event on social distancing and the spread of COVID-19. 1st, using anonymized cell phone data from SafeGraph, Inc. we document that (i) smartphone pings from non-residents, and (ii) foot traffic at restaurants and bars, retail establishments, entertainment venues, hotels, and campgrounds each rose substantially in the census block groups hosting Sturgis rally events. Stay-at-home behavior among local residents, as measured by median hours spent at home, fell. 2nd, using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and a synthetic control approach, we show that by [2 Sep 2020], a month following the onset of the rally, COVID-19 cases increased by approximately 6 to 7 cases per 1000 population in its home county of Meade. Finally, difference-in-differences (dose response) estimates show that following the Sturgis event, counties that contributed the highest inflows of rally attendees experienced a 7.0 to 12.5 percent increase in COVID-19 cases relative to counties that did not contribute inflows. Descriptive evidence suggests these effects may be muted in states with stricter mitigation policies (i.e., restrictions on bar/restaurant openings, mask-wearing mandates). We conclude that the Sturgis motorcycle rally generated public health costs of approximately USD 12.2 billion.

Introduction
------------
Restrictions on large gatherings during a pandemic is a form of government regulation of quantity within a market to curb a negative externality. In that way, gathering restrictions are similar to public smoking bans, chemical emission standards, or vaccination mandates. /1 In this case, the negative externality is due to infection risk, so the blanket nature of a gathering restriction is a key part of the containment strategy as a single mass gathering has the potential to generate a large number of cases, a phenomenon referred to as a "superspreading event." Indeed, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) deems "large in-person gatherings where it is difficult for individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart and attendees travel from outside the local area" among the highest risk activities for the spread of COVID-19 (CDC 2020). The risk of contagion of COVID-19 is exacerbated at such events if (i) there are high frequency, prolonged interactions between individuals, and (ii) pre-event COVID-19 case growth in the county hosting the event is elevated (CDC 2020).

In this study we examine the 80th Annual Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, a 10-day event with dozens of concerts, live performances, races, and bike shows that drew over 460 000 individuals to a city with a population of approximately 7000 located in a county with a population of approximately 26 000 (Maxouris 2020; South Dakota Department of Transportation 2020; Yost 2020). COVID-19 mitigation efforts at the Sturgis rally were largely left to the "personal responsibility" of attendees (Knowles and Lati 2020), and post-opening day media reports suggest that social distancing and mask-wearing were quite rare in Sturgis (Walker 2020; Porterfield 2020; Orecchio-Egresitz 2020; Groves 2020). /3

The Sturgis motorcycle rally represents a situation where many of the "worst case scenarios" for superspreading occurred simultaneously: the event was prolonged, included individuals packed closely together, involved a large out-of-town population (a population that was orders of magnitude larger than the local population), and had low compliance with recommended infection countermeasures such as the use of masks. The only large factors working to prevent the spread of infection was the outdoor venue and low population density in the state of South Dakota.

We document 3 key results. 1st, using anonymized smartphone data from SafeGraph, Inc., we demonstrate that non-resident cell phone pings rose in the census block groups where the Sturgis events took place over the 10-day period of the rally relative to other census block groups within South Dakota and in border states to South Dakota. Furthermore, we find that foot traffic at restaurants and bars, hotels, entertainment venues, and retail establishments in CBGs [census block groups] hosting Sturgis rally events rose by up to 90 percent during the event, relative to nearby CBGs. 2nd, we find that stay-at-home behavior declined among residents of Meade County We find that the Sturgis rally event was associated with a 9.4 to 10.9 percent decline in median hours spent at home. Finally, turning to COVID-19 case data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), we find that the Sturgis rally caused spread of COVID-19 cases both locally and in the home counties of those who traveled to the Sturgis rally and returned home.

Using a synthetic control approach, we find that the Sturgis event increased COVID-19 cases in Meade County by 6.3 to 6.9 cases per 1000 population as of [2 Sep 2020], a month following the onset of events at the Sturgis rally. For the state of South Dakota as a whole, we find that the Sturgis event increased COVID-19 cases by 3.6 to 3.9 cases per 1000 population as of [2 Sep 2020]. This represents an increase of over 35 percent relative to the 9.7 cases per 1000 population in South Dakota on [31 Jul 2020] (South Dakota Department of Health 2020).

Then, using a dose response difference-in-differences model, we find that counties that contributed the highest inflows of Sturgis attendees saw COVID-19 cases rise by 10.7 percent following the Sturgis event relative to counties without any detected attendees. Descriptive evidence suggests some evidence of variation in local COVID-19 spread depending on the stringency of local contagion mitigation policies. We conclude that the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally generated substantial public health costs, which we calculate to reach at least USD 12.2 billion using the statistical value of a COVID-19 case estimated by Kniesner and Sullivan (2020). While we note that this estimate captures the full costs of infections due to the Sturgis rally -- and is an overestimate of the externality cost because this number includes COVID-19 infections to individuals who attended the rally (and may have internalized private health risks) -- we nonetheless conclude that local and nationwide contagion from this event was substantial.

[This is a very interesting paper generated by economists, using solid data and theory. The full extent of the superspreading event may never be known, but early data of 1st and possibly 2nd generation cases are sobering. The authors demonstrated increases in COVID-19 cases of 12.5% in counties outside of the Dakotas with moderate numbers of attendees to the rally vs no increases in counties with low numbers of attendees. The authors conclude: "We are further able to document national spread due to the Sturgis motorcycle rally, although that spread also appears to have been successfully mitigated by states with strict infection mitigation policies. In counties with the largest relative inflow to the event, the per 1000 case rate increased by 10.7 percent after 24 days following the onset of Sturgis pre-rally events. Multiplying the percent case increases for the high, moderate-high and moderate inflow counties by each county's respective pre-rally cumulative COVID-19 cases and aggregating, yields a total of 263 708 additional cases in these locations due to the Sturgis motorcycle rally."

They also conclude: "If we conservatively assume that all of these cases were non-fatal, then these cases represent a cost of over USD 12.2 billion, based on the statistical cost of a COVID-19 case of USD 46 000 estimated by Kniesner and Sullivan (2020). This is enough to have paid each of the estimated 462 182 rally attendees USD 26 553.64 not to attend."

- The Americas region reported 37.1% of daily case numbers and 76.3% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, maintaining its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 14.1 million cases. The USA and Brazil remain dominant, followed by Colombia, Argentina, Peru, and Mexico.

- The European region reported 13.4% of daily case numbers and 5.0% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 4.5 million. Countries not reporting to WHO today [7 Sep 2020] include Spain, Israel, and Belgium. The dominant country is Russia, followed by France, the UK, Ukraine, Turkey, Germany, and Italy.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 6.3% of daily case numbers and 3.1% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of greater than 2 million cases. Iraq remains the dominant country, followed by Iran, Morocco, Libya, Kuwait, the Palestinian Authority, and Saudi Arabia.

- The African region reported 1.9% of daily case numbers and 1.7% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than one million cases. Ethiopia is now the dominant country, followed by South Africa, Algeria, Zimbabwe, and Cameroon.

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.0% of daily case numbers and 0.49% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.52 million cases. The Philippines continues to dominate, followed by Japan and South Korea.

- The South East Asia region reported 40.3% of the daily newly reported cases and 13.4% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 4.8 million cases. India continues to dominate followed by Indonesia, Bangladesh, and Nepal.

Europe, while experiencing resurgences in many countries related to loosening restrictions and the summer vacation period, is overshadowed by the major transmission ongoing in South East Asia, specifically India. Noteworthy is that the Italian MOH data today [8 Sep 2020] shows an increase of 10.5% in newly confirmed cases and on mortality shows an increase of 56.5% in comparing 7-day averages.

[The USA, India, and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations, with India now in the 2nd position followed by Brazil. In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (89 852), followed by the USA (28 656) and Brazil (17 330) -- account for over half of all confirmed cases globally (54.3%) and 54.8% of all newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. A global total of 4934 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (7-8 Sep 2020).

Countries reporting more than 5000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours include India, USA, Brazil, Argentina (12 027), Spain (8964), Colombia (7665), France (6544), Mexico (5351) and Russia (5099), and 29 countries have reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours. 5 of the top 10 countries reporting the highest daily newly confirmed cases are from the Americas region and 7 of the top 20 countries reporting the highest daily newly confirmed cases are from the European region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is virtually no change (a decrease of 0.85%), while daily reported deaths have increased by 7.0%.

Impression: The European region is seeing increasing cases in western European countries that had markedly reduced transmission in late spring. The most severely affected region remains the Americas, even with the weekend reporting artifacts. - Mod.MPP]
