Contaminated water kills one, 100 admitted to hospital
--------------------------------------------------
A girl died and more than 100 people were admitted to hospital as
gastroenteritis triggered by contaminated water gripped a southern
Pakistani town.
"We have received over 90 patients so far," administration chief of the
town of Jacobabad Ghulam Mohammad Channa told AFP on Tuesday. "We are
trying to ensure the availability of medicine on an emergency basis," he
said adding that a girl died over the weekend.
Residents of Jacobabad, some 556 kilometers (333.9 miles) northwest of
Karachi said 120 people had been affected by diarrhoea and other stomach
ailments over the past 2 weeks.
Local hospital chief Manzoor Khosa said he had been receiving 15-20
patients daily, [and that] "80 percent of the victims are children." They
were suffering from stomach disease including dehydration, he said.
Khosa said samples of water had been sent for laboratory tests.
The incident is the 2nd in April 2005 in Sindh province.
At least 3 people, 2 of them children, died and more than 100 were admitted
to hospital after drinking contaminated water in Larkana district 600
kilometers (372 miles) east of Karachi earlier in April 2005.
During 2004, contaminated water left several people dead in Hyderabad,
about 160 kilometers (99 miles) from here.

[Although a large number of people appear to be affected, there is no
indication as to what the poison could be. Gastrointestinal signs are
common enough that the water may contain coliform bacteria or other
microorganisms, which could produce the gastroenteritis. If there is
authoritative information available, we would appreciate it being shared. -
