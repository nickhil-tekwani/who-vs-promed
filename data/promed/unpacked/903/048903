On 26 Mar 2012, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia's (FYROM) Ministry of Agriculture reported to OIE one case of rabies in a cat (domestic animal) in Radovis (east of the country, cf. map 3). This is officially the 1st case of rabies observed in cats in the country.

The source of infection of domestic cats was not mentioned.

In regard to their close contact with humans, circulation of rabies among pets increases the risk of exposure to humans.

The last case of rabies officially reported in Macedonia was in a wild animal in August 2011 (cf. eWEB n176).

[The OIE notification of 26 Mar 2012, to which the above news item refers, is available -- with an interactive map -- at http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=11710. The notification included the following epidemiological comments: "This is officially the 1st case of rabies observed in cats. In the afternoon on 2 Mar 2012, the cat attacked the owners. Laboratory analysis has been performed in the national laboratory within the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine (Skopje), and a positive result has been obtained. The owners of the cat have been appropriately treated with anti-rabies post-exposure prophylaxis at the clinic for infectious diseases in Shtip. The other animals (a dog and a cat) from the same yard, which had contact with the infected cat, have been euthanized."

Rabies has not reported in domestic animals in Macedonia (FYROM) since December 2000; vaccination is compulsory in dogs, not in cats. Cases in wildlife have not been reported for several years, but 6 such cases are included in the country's report for the months July-December 2011; details on these cases are requested.

Rabies in cats should not be a surprise. According to the last available data on the web-site "Rabies - Bulletin - Europe" (published by the Rabies Information System of the WHO Collaboration Centre for Rabies Surveillance and Research, at http://rbe1.fli.bund.de/Queries/Maps.aspx), the following numbers of diagnosed rabies cases in domestic animals were recorded during 2009 throughout Europe (predominantly in eastern and south Eastern Europe): dog 684, cat 495, cattle 283, sheep & goat 61, equine 28, pig 5.

Rabies in cats is predominantly of the furious form, associated with infection of the limbic system. It is characterized by restlessness, wandering, howling, polypnea, drooling, and attacks on animals, people or inanimate objects. - Mod.AS
