HONOLULU, USA -- [There is an outbreak of suspected ciguatera fish
poisoning in Navatos, Metro Manila. Ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP) is the
most common fish [poisoning problem in the Pacific and Indian oceans, and
the Caribbean.
The ciguatera toxin is produced by the marine microorganism _Gambierdiscus
toxicus_, commonly known as a "dinoflagellate" and is eaten by reef fish,
who are in turn eaten by predator fish, thereby passing the toxin up the
food chain.
Ciguatera fish poisoning is a serious threat to public health and fishery
developments along tropical and subtropical shorelines. As many as 400
million people live in these areas and are unaware of the dangers of CFP.
Predictions are for more outbreaks of CFP as increased fish consumption
drives worldwide trade, particularly exports from fish-rich Pacific Island
nations.
On 20 Jun 2001, the Department of Health (DOH) of the Philippines issued an
urgent warning to the public against eating large carnivorous predator fish
in response to 38 (50 cases as of 22 Jun 2001) cases of food poisoning from
eating ciguatoxic barracuda.
Clinical signs began 5 to 6 hours after ingestion of the fish. The victims
experienced numbness of extremities, diarrhea, abdominal pain, chills,
vomiting, and headaches. Among the victims, 7 were rushed to medical
centers; their ages varied from 1 to 68 years.
According to the DOH National Epidemiology Center investigation, the toxic
barracuda came from the same vendor and appeared and tasted normal. "This
is what`s dangerous about CFP. Ciguatoxic fish can look and taste perfectly
normal. Also cooking, drying, or freezing toxic fish does NOT destroy the
ciguatera toxins," says Dr. Joanne Ebesu, Director of Research at OTS.
