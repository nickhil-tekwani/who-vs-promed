New records
-----------
In Libya, symptoms of 'brittle leaf disease' of date palms (or
'maladie des feuilles cassantes' -- formerly on the EPPO Alert List)
have been reported near Waddan (municipality of Al Jufrah). The
etiology of this disease is still unclear.

[Brittle leaf disease has affected or killed up to 40 000 date palm
trees in southern Tunisia since the 1980s. Similar symptoms have been
reported as early as the 1940s, but the disease started to spread
rapidly from the 1980s onwards and has reached Algeria and now Libya.
On some farms 100 percent of trees are affected. Symptoms include a
dull green colour of some fronds and necrotic streaks on leaflets,
which become brittle, twisted, and shrivelled, and break easily.
Affected trees stop growing, have reduced fronds, and eventually die.
Death of the palm occurs usually within 4 to 6 years, but the closer
to the heart the 1st symptoms appear, the quicker the tree dies. Some
variation in susceptibility has been reported for different date cultivars.

The cause is yet unknown, but based on aspects of disease
epidemiology the involvement of a contagious pathogen is suspected.
One or several disease specific small RNAs have been reported which
are not present in healthy trees, and affected leaflets are deficient
in manganese. Both observations may be due to the effect of the
disease on host physiology, rather than connected with a cause.
Disease foci of clustered affected palms are common, but it is not
known yet how the disease is spread in the field. Until more
information becomes available, possible spread with infected plant
material must be prevented.
