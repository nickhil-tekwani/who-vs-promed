In the State of Manipur in the North East region of India, 18 persons died
of rabies in one week, as reported in the New Indian Express (Chennai
edition) of 22 Mar 2006. The report said that the problem was partly due to
local shortage of rabies vaccine. No further details are available.
There is no clear direction on rabies control in the National Health Policy
(2002) of India. Although recognised as a widespread and frequent problem,
rabies is not included in the World Bank-supported new nationwide
integrated disease surveillance system. The State-run district level
disease surveillance in Kerala in southern India, in which rabies was
reportable, has recently been discontinued in preparation to introduce the
integrated surveillance. Thus, there is no reliable count on rabies
anywhere in India. The Sir Ronald Ross Institute of Tropical and Infectious
Diseases in Hyderabad had diagnosed rabies in 76 patients in 2005.
The existing laws do not permit killing of street (stray) dogs and
sterilisation attempts on them have not been successful. The annual risk
of bite by stray dogs is about 2 per 100 persons in the city of Bangalore.
Rabies occurs in foreign tourists, although rarely. The risk is of low
probability but of fatal consequence. Pre-exposure rabies prophylaxis by
vaccination is a safe and practical option for urban dwellers and tourists.

[According to the US CDC (<http://www.who.int/vaccines/en/rabies.shtml>) in
about 100 countries, rabies is enzootic in both wild and domestic animals
and poses a potential threat to a considerable proportion of the more than
2.5 billion people living in these areas. More than 99 percent of all human
deaths due to rabies occur in tropical developing countries in Africa, Asia
and South America. Among human infections, rabies is believed to be the
10th most common cause of death. Once clinical symptoms have occurred, the
disease is almost invariably fatal. However, reporting is often incomplete
and the estimated 50 000 deaths per year may be an underestimate. Asia
accounts for more than 90 percent of all rabies fatalities. India alone
reports 30 000 deaths per year, i.e. an annual incidence of approximately 3
deaths per 100 000 population. Annual incidences of 0.01-0.2 deaths per 100
000 are reported from Latin America. In Africa, 0.001-13 deaths per 100 000
are reported, but rab!
ies is grossly under-reported in many countries.
Professor John draws attention to some of the practical and administrative
difficulties relating to the control of rabies virus infection in the
Indian subcontinent. It seems unlikely that there will be any immediate
improvement in the situation. Until these difficulties have been addressed
systematically, visitors intending to remain in India for long periods
should ensure that they undergo pre-exposure vaccination before travelling.
