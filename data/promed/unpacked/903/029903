A devastating panicle blight disease affecting the major rice growing regions of Venezuela is expected to contribute to the lowest output of milled rice in that country since 1972, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA).

Production of rice in the 2018-19 marketing year is forecast down 49 per cent from 2017-18. The disease also is forecast to have an impact on area harvested to rice for 2018-19 at 70 000 hectares [about 173 000 acres], down from 135 000 hectares [about 333 600 acres] in 2017-18.

"According to FEDEAGRO (the Venezuelan Agricultural Federation), it will be difficult to project the exact impact of the disease until the latter half of the rice growing cycle during the grain filling/ripening stage," the USDA said. "However, grave results are likely given the lack of chemical inputs to control the disease."

[_Burkholderia glumae_ causes bacterial panicle blight of rice (BPB) as well as bacterial wilts in a number of other field crops. In some areas, _B. gladioli_ has also been detected in BPB affected rice, but is generally considered a minor contributor. BPB has been known in Japan since 1955 and has more recently also been reported in other rice-producing countries around the world. For example, in the late 1990's it caused devastating yield losses in India (Bengal). Outbreaks with severe crop losses have been reported in the Americas, for example from the Dominican Republic and the southern USA. BPB is considered an emerging disease in South America.

Symptoms may include sheath, seedling and grain rots, as well as abortion of florets resulting in greatly reduced grain filling and potential yield losses of up to 40 per cent. Disease development is favoured by warm temperatures. Despite its economic importance, virulence mechanisms of _B. glumae_ are poorly understood.

The pathogen is carried on seeds and is often present in commercial rice seed. No complete resistance has been identified in rice cultivars anywhere in the world, but varieties with reduced sensitivity are available and resistance breeding programmes are in progress.
