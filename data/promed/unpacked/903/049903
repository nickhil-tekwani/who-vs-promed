[1] Undiagnosed disease - Cote d'Ivoire: phytoplasma

A phytoplasma identified as the causal agent of a lethal coconut disease in Cote d'Ivoire
----------------------------------------------------------------------
COGENT [International Coconut Genetic Resources Network] was recently informed that a phytoplasma has been formally identified as the causal agent of the disease destroying many coconut palms in the region of Grand Lahou [Lagunes Region] in Cote d'Ivoire. This information was released by Dr Jean Louis Konan, National Agronomic Research Centre of Cote d'Ivoire.

Dr Konan said that 2 independent laboratories in Mexico and Canada gave the same result. "The disease seems quite similar to the lethal yellowing disease occurring in Ghana [Cape St Paul wilt, ProMED-mail post 20090831.3067], but we will need to achieve the complete sequencing of the phytoplasma genome to be fully conclusive on this point."

The disease has now been recorded at a location less than 150 km [93 mi] from the international coconut genebank for Africa and the Indian Ocean. This genebank at the Marc Delorme Research Centre near Abidjan has been the main provider of coconut germplasm at international level during the last 20 years.

A new phytoplasma disease has also been identified in Papua New Guinea, seriously threatening another international genebank [Bogia wilt, see item 2 below]. These new threats will significantly influence the global strategy for conservation and use of coconut genetic resources, currently being compiled by COGENT and to be published by the end of 2013.

A new lethal disease is threatening coconut palm and bananas
------------------------------------------------------------
COGENT has launched a new warning video that alerts viewers to a new lethal plant disease called Bogia syndrome in Papua New Guinea [PNG; ProMED-mail posts 20110223.0592 and 20120405.1090762]. This devastating disease is spreading and killing more and more coconut palms, other palms species like betel nut and some banana varieties.

Around 10 million farmers and their families cultivate coconut palms worldwide on about 12 million hectares [29.7 million acres], and many more people own a few coconut palms which contribute to their livelihoods. Bogia syndrome, which could trigger harsh social consequences, was recently identified in Madang province, PNG, less than 15 km [9.3 mi] from an important International Coconut Collection. This genebank conserves coconut varieties for the whole Pacific region.

"We need to relocate the collection within PNG but also transfer it to another Pacific country", says the COGENT coordinator, Dr Roland Bourdeix. With support from Bioversity International and CGIAR [Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research], COGENT is mobilizing researchers and other stakeholders to fight the disease and relocate this international genebank. This action will be a component of the Global Strategy for Coconut Genetic Resources Conservation and Use, to be published by COGENT at the end of 2013.

[Lethal yellowing (LY) diseases are caused by phytoplasmas of the palm lethal yellowing (LY or 16SrIV) group. A number of strains or species have been described from the Caribbean, Latin America, Africa, and southern Asia. LY has seriously jeopardised coconut industries in the respective areas and can also affect a large number of other palm species. Symptoms include premature nut drop, blackening of inflorescences, yellowing of fronds, and death of the palm usually within 4 to 6 months. The planthopper _Myndus crudus_ is suspected to be the vector in the Americas, but different vectors may be involved in the spread of LY strains elsewhere. Seed transmission of the pathogens cannot be excluded, and some weed species may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Jumps of LY across apparently unaffected coconut populations have been observed possibly due to aerial spread of infectious vector insects or human activities. Commercial control of LY diseases relies on replanting with resistant varieties, but an unexplained resistance breakdown of some widely used Malayan Dwarf hybrids is causing great concern. Reasons for the resistance breakdown are still uncertain.

Undiagnosed disease - Ivory Coast
---------------------------------
The Ivory Coast (IC) coconut population has long been considered under threat from Cape St Paul wilt (CSPW) spreading from neighbouring Ghana (ProMED-mail post 20090831.3067). CSPW is caused by a phytoplasma tentatively assigned to the palm lethal yellowing (LY; 16SrIV) group. An undiagnosed disease was reported in IC earlier in 2013 (ProMED-mail post 20130301.1563457) with symptoms similar to lethal yellowing diseases. As stated in item 1 above, complete sequence information will be required to determine the taxonomic relationships of the phytoplasma which has now been identified in association with the new disease.

Bogia wilt
----------
In 2011, a phytoplasma of the LY group was identified as the cause of the Bogia syndrome in Papua New Guinea (PNG) (ProMED-mail post 20110223.0592) representing the 1st report of a LY-like disease of coconut in Oceania. The disease is reported to spread rapidly and to have caused losses of over 5000 trees. It is considered a threat to regional coconut production as well as the economically important national oil palm industry. The coconut germplasm collection now under threat is located at the Stewart Research Centre, Medang (PNG), and holds 57 varieties totaling 3200 palms (see links below). Road blocks have been put in place to prevent the movement of coconuts and seedlings in the hope to rescue the collection. Mode of spread and host range of the disease remain to be clarified.

A possible causal relationship between presence of phytoplasmas and unusual wilt symptoms in plantains (cooking bananas) has also been reported from PNG. Sequence analysis showed that phytoplasmas from diseased plants in 4 provinces were unique, but most closely related to the Bogia phytoplasma (see link below).

Another new phytoplasma of the LY group has also been reported recently in sabal palms in Mexico (ProMED-mail post 20110223.0592). Additional new members of the LY group may be present in other areas awaiting detection.
