[Below is a relevant press release that I received from the Humane
Society of the US on 2 Apr 2009
(<http://singaporecommunitycats.blogspot.com/2009/04/spayneuter-success-in-bhutan.html>).
I am personally familiar with the earlier and ongoing work of HSI
[Humane Society International] project coordinator Rahul Sehgal in
Ahmedabad and Bangalore, India, and had a role in making the
introductions that led to the HSI project in Bhutan. - Comm.MC]

Spay/neuter success in Bhutan
-----------------------------
In February 2009, Humane Society International (HSI) commissioned a
12-member veterinary team to carry out a 2-month
spay/neuter/vaccination program in the capital city of Thimphu,
Bhutan. Now in the final days of the program, HSI has succeeded in
its goal of reaching 1200 street dogs.

In need of a quick solution
---------------------------
Nearly 2 years ago, HSI was introduced to the Bhutanese government by
the Bhutan Foundation, an organization with a strong history of
working in the country. The Bhutan Foundation wanted to see a
worthwhile and humane program developed to address the street dog
issue. But, during the all-important historical event of Bhutan's
transition to a democracy and the impending coronation of the new
king in November 2008, royal officials were under immense pressure to
do something about the street dog population immediately.

Good intentions; tragic results
-------------------------------
Bhutan is a country with a strong Buddhist religious base and
therefore, kindness is a core value of their culture. Although the
street dog population was an issue, the Bhutanese wanted to use
humane means of control rather than the cruel means that many
countries resort to, such as poisoning or electrocution. However, due
to a lack of time and planning, the Bhutanese officials instead
carried out a huge impoundment program over 15 months to rid the
streets of Thimphu and Paro (the main cities of Bhutan) of thousands
of street dogs. They assumed that the dogs would coexist peacefully
in a shelter environment and they would have an immediate solution to
the problem.

HSI, during previous visits to the country, had strongly protested
this mass sheltering plan as we were aware that much more time,
funding, expertise, and planning were necessary to undertake this
program correctly. Although this kind of action may appear to be a
"quick fix" to clearing stray dogs from the streets, it actually
perpetuates the problem in the long term.

After the coronation was over and attention returned to the state of
animals impounded in several shelters across the country, a very dark
scenario emerged. Of the thousands of dogs in the shelters, most were
in terrible condition, and many had died. These unintentional and sad
results made the government eager to improve the situation and adopt
a street dog population control program that would be effective and
humane for the long term.

Pilot program developed
-----------------------
With very few vets across Bhutan to train and a massive task at hand,
HSI proposed to bring in one of its own HSI CNVR (Catch Neuter
Vaccinate Release) veterinary teams specializing in large-scale
spay/neuter operations. To start, a 2-month pilot program would
target 1200 dogs in Thimphu, but the long-term hope was for a
nationwide program.

The Bhutan government accepted the proposal and the HSI team, headed
by our India Manager, Rahul Sehgal, arrived in Bhutan on 14 Feb 2009.

Lessons learned
---------------
The team made some very important discoveries, which are being
documented for future reference to areas which follow similar
practices of trying to get rid of street dogs:
- All areas cleared of dogs through impounding have more dogs now,
after the impounding was discontinued.
- The new dogs are more aggressive and are breeding more profusely
than the dogs who had occupied the areas previously.
- The dog owners' trust is very difficult to earn as they have become
suspicious that the dogs taken away will never be returned.
- The dogs who escaped capture for the previous sheltering program
are now scared and difficult to catch.

Success at hand
---------------
The HSI CNVR pilot program is in its final days and the program has
reached its target number. The involved government officials are very
impressed with the professionalism and the expertise of the HSI team.
HSI's work has been vindicated by the fact that the chief guest for
the inauguration of the project, the honorable health secretary, sent
his own dogs for surgery following his opening of the clinic.

Distribution of 10 000 pamphlets across the city has helped to
educate local communities about the CNVR program and its importance.
As was hoped for, discussions are currently underway to develop a
long-term CNVR project with nationwide coverage across Bhutan, with
HSI as the lead agency to implement the project.

[ProMED-mail thanks Merritt Clifton for drawing attention to the CNVR
program, which has achieved some success in the capital city of
Thimphu, Bhutan. We hope that the Humane Society International will
be able to extend this program beyond the capital.
