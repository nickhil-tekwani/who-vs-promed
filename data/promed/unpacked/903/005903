A 66-year-old veteran was admitted to our facility related to 4 weeks of fever, drenching night sweats, and a 10-pound weight loss. He was a Viet Nam veteran who was born in Ecuador, moving to the USA 40 years before. His last trip back to Ecuador was 5 years previously but does get periodic visits from relatives still living there.

Initial blood cultures grew a bacillus identified as a _Brucella_, and he subsequently had 5 positive blood cultures for the organism over 4 days. Speciation of the organism was done at the New York State Department of Health and revealed to be _B. abortus_. Although he initially denied eating cheese brought from Ecuador, his daughter reported that the family had eaten cheese brought from Ecuador several times in 2012, the last time within a month of the onset of symptoms.

Brucella agglutinins were subsequently positive. A transesophageal echocardiogram did not reveal valvular vegetations. He became afebrile promptly after treatment was begun with rifampin and doxycycline. All follow up blood cultures were negative. No other illnesses or serological evidence of brucellosis were found in other family members. Laboratory workers who had handled the isolate were given antimicrobial prophylaxis and are to have serological follow ups.

[The following moderator comments regarding _B. abortus_ in bovines are taken from "Brucellosis, bison - Canada: (AB)," archive number 20110730.2294:

"Brucellosis, in cattle, water buffalo, and bison is caused almost exclusively by _Brucella abortus_; however, _B. suis_ or _B. melitensis_ are occasionally implicated in some cattle herds. _B. suis_ does not appear to be contagious from cow to cow. Infection spreads rapidly and causes many abortions in unvaccinated cattle. In a herd in which the disease is endemic, an infected cow typically aborts only once after exposure; subsequent gestations and lactations appear normal. After exposure, cattle become bacteremic for a short period and develop agglutinins and other antibodies; some resist infection, and a small percentage of infected cows recover. A positive serum agglutination test usually precedes an abortion or a normal parturition but may be delayed in about 15 per cent of cows. The incubation period may be variable and is inversely related to stage of gestation at time of exposure. Organisms are shed in milk and uterine discharges, and the cow may become temporarily infertile. Bacteria may be found in the uterus during pregnancy, uterine involution, and infrequently, for a prolonged time, in the non-gravid uterus. Shedding from the vagina largely disappears with the decrease of fluids following parturition. Some infected cows that previously aborted shed brucellae from the uterus at subsequent normal parturitions. Organisms are shed in milk for a variable length of time, in most cattle for life.

Natural transmission occurs by ingestion of organisms, which are present in large numbers in aborted fetuses, fetal membranes, and uterine discharges. Cattle may ingest contaminated feed and water, or lick contaminated genitals of other animals. Venereal transmission by infected bulls to susceptible cows appears to be rare. Transmission may occur by artificial insemination when brucella-contaminated semen is deposited in the uterus but, reportedly, not when deposited in the mid-cervix. Brucellae may enter the body through mucous membranes, conjunctivae, wounds, or intact skin.

Brucellae have been recovered from fetuses and from manure that has remained in a cool environment for more than 2 months. Exposure to direct sunlight kills the organisms within a few hours.

Because organisms are shed in the milk, unpasteurized milk, and cheese represent a human health concern. Many individuals believe drinking unpasteurized milk is better for their health. Diseases that are not killed by pasteurization represent a risk to the consumer. Brucellosis in humans causes malaise, fever, chills, sweats, headache, neck pain, low back pain, joint pain, muscle pain, occasionally diarrhea, constipation, anorexia, weight loss, abdominal pain, weakness, irritability, insomnia, and depression. Brucellosis has been called undulating fever because of its habit of producing fever and signs that wax and wane over an extended period of time." - Mod.LL]
