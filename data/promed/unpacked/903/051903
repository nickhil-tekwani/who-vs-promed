Even as coronavirus [COVID-19] fear has gripped the state [Karnataka], a death has occurred due to monkey fever, also known as Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD). [K] (aged 40) from Halthota village, Ksaguppe near Aralagodu, Sagar [sub district] in the district [Shimoga, Karnataka] breathed his last due to this disease on [Sat 14 Mar 2020].

The man was suffering from severe fever and headache and was under treatment at the government hospital. Blood tests proved that he was suffering from monkey fever. Therefore, he was admitted into Kasturba Medical College Hospital at Manipal. As the family members could not meet the exorbitant treatment expenses, they got him discharged and admitted into Mcgann Hospital at Shivamogga [district in the state].

Accusing the health department of being responsible for [K's] death, people staged a protest on [Sun 15 Mar 2020] in front of the primary health centre at Aralagodu.

[Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) is an acute febrile illness caused by Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV), a member of the family _Flaviviridae_, characterized by severe muscle pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, and bleeding manifestations. The virus was first identified in 1957 after it was isolated from a sick monkey from the Kyasanur Forest in Karnataka State, India. Shimoga district, officially known as Shivamogga district, is a district in the Karnataka state of India.

The disease is transmitted to humans following a tick bite or contact with an infected animal, especially a sick or recently dead monkey. There is no evidence of person-to-person transmission (https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/kyasanur/index.html). KFD typically occurs during the dry season from November through May, which correlates with the increased activity of the nymphs of ticks. Exposure to adult ticks and nymphs in rural or outdoor settings increases the risk of infection; herders, forest workers, farmers, and hunters are particularly at increased risk of contracting the disease. Vaccination and personal protective measures against tick bites are keys to preventing KFD.

There is no specific treatment for KFD. Prompt symptomatic and supportive treatment can reduce morbidity and mortality. Surveillance (human, monkey, and tick), personal protection against tick bites, and vaccination are the key measures for prevention and control of KFD (https://idsp.nic.in/WriteReadData/l892s/60398414361527247979.pdf).

The recommended preventive measures include using tick repellents, walking along clear trails, avoiding contact with weeds, and wearing full-sleeved clothes and long pants to cover exposed skin, to reduce contact with ticks and subsequent tick bites. - Mod.UBA
