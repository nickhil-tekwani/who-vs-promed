Please find below a response to the 2 ProMED-mail postings on undiagnosed cattle deaths in New South Wales (NSW), Australia:

The following information has been provided by Ian Roth, chief veterinary officer of NSW
(Department of Primary Industries, 161 Kite Street, Locked bag 21, Orange NSW 2800, Australia)

The New South Wales Department of Primary Industries (NSW DPI) is conducting investigations into a disease of cattle in the western area of New South Wales (NSW). The disease has been called "3D syndrome" as the major signs noticed by landholders are drooling, diarrhoea, and death. The Department has prepared information on the 3D syndrome which can be accessed at http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/agriculture/livestock/health/specific/cattle/cattle-deaths-with-drooling-and-diarrhoea-3d-syndrome.

To date an extensive range of virus testing has been conducted. Tests for vesicular diseases (including foot and mouth disease) have consistently been negative. Comprehensive serological monitoring for bluetongue virus is conducted under the National Arbovirus Monitoring Programme (see http://www.animalhealthaustralia.com.au/programs/disease-surveillance/national-arbovirus-monitoring-program).

This programme includes farms located in the bluetongue free zone of Western NSW. Testing for viruses within the Orbivirus genus on affected farms using an Orbivirus group PCR, and specific PCRs and ELISAs for epizootic haemorrhagic disease and bluetongue viruses have given negative results.

- Tests for rinderpest have been negative.

- A flavivirus generic PCR has been negative, though 2 animals showed serological evidence of prior exposure and tested positive for Murray Valley encephalitis virus and Kunjin virus. It is known that these viruses are present in Western NSW and that a proportion of cattle will test positive.

- Bovine immunodeficiency virus, bovine leukaemia virus and bovine malignant catarrhal fever virus have been negative in PCR assays.

- Infection with bovine virus diarrhoea and bovine herpes virus 1 and 5 has been detected, though inconsistently, and these viruses are not regarded as the cause.

- Virus isolation in cell culture using a wide range of cell types (cattle and insect) known to detect a broad range of different virus families has been conducted. These are very broad "non-specific" cultural methods that could detect any infectious virus present. Where finalised, culture has been negative, and results are negative to date for those currently under way.

- Next generation sequencing -- nucleic acid from samples from affected cattle have been sequenced. Using bioinformatics, nucleic acid known to be of bovine origin is ignored and remaining sequences are assembled. The assembled sequences are compared to known sequences. These have not detected known viral pathogens.

A wide range of additional testing has been conducted and while some endemic diseases have been confirmed in individual animals, none are regarded as the cause of the 3D syndrome.

Based on investigations to date there is not convincing evidence that an infectious agent is involved. Thus the affected properties are not in quarantine.

It is the view of the NSW Food Authority that the incident does not present a food safety risk. NSW DPI will continue to liaise with NSW health authorities as information comes to light on the aetiology of this disease.

NSW DPI will continue to conduct investigations on the properties to determine the cause of the 3D syndrome. Toxic or infectious agents are regarded as the most likely cause. A toxin such as a mycotoxin remains a strong possibility. Inorganic toxins including arsenic and lead have been excluded. The failure to detect an infectious agent in extensive testing from affected animals reduces the likelihood an infectious agent is the cause.

[We very much appreciate the official response to this situation. Thank you for letting us know what you have ruled out and that your investigation continues. We wish you rapid success at identifying the cause of 3D syndrome.
