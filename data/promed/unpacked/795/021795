[It appears as if the epidemiologic pattern is one in which large
numbers of pigs are affected. In Germany, infections have been
sometimes encountered in wild boars, which have not caused outbreaks
on commercial scale farms. Other sources of infection for commercial
farms are the feeding of uncooked swill (garbage) and then, of
course, the movement of infected animals, fomites etc. It will be
useful to note what the outbreak investigation yields in this regard.
