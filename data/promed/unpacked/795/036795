Unidentified disease kills 3 in Congo
-------------------------------------
An unidentified disease has killed 3 people and spread to more than
100 others in the south west of the Republic of the Congo, according
to medical sources who suspect swine flu, the pandemic (H1N1) 2009
virus. "3 people have lost their lives since the epidemic broke out a
few days ago," said a local medical source. "A little more than 100
others are being monitored in the hospital" at Londela Kayes [Niari
department], more than 350 km [220 mi] south west of Brazzaville. The
symptoms are acute diarrhoea, high fever, and vomiting.

"We haven't yet received samples that we can analyse to determine the
origins of the illness," a doctor at the National Laboratory of
Public Health, Jean-Vivien Mombouli, said, adding that swine flu was
nevertheless suspected. "We are at the stage of suspicions. Since
[pandemic] H1N1 flu has already affected Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire
(home to more than half the population of the country), it's probable
that the movements of traders and agents of the state in small places
have contaminated people," Dr Mombouli said. The Congo registered its
1st cases of the [pandemic] A (H1N1) virus at the end of October
[2009] in a private school in Brazzaville [see ProMED-mail archived
reference below].

The Congolese authorities state that they have set up an alert
system, with the help of the World Health Organisation, making it
possible to detect all kinds of flu and to react rapidly.

[Insufficient information is provided in this report to identify the
disease. An outbreak of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza is suspected,
but the symptoms described are not sufficiently specific to confirm
this, or even to indicate that the etiologic agent is a virus.

Influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection is a possibility since
this infection has been reported in school children in Brazzaville,
but the mortality rate in this outbreak is high. Additional
information concerning this outbreak would be appreciated.
