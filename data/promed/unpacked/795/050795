---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The current leptospirosis outbreak in Northern Israel with 36 confirmed/probably and 583 suspected cases, has been a concerning health risk among all travelers visiting this region, but special surveillance seemed warranted for adolescents.(1) Israel is a popular summer destination among youths for camps, tours, and fresh-water recreational activities; making up to 40% of all visitors.(2) Therefore, physicians should have raised clinical awareness for young travelers returning from Israel with an acute febrile illness. We report three cases of suspected leptospirosis, one confirmed, of teenaged travelers to Israel.

All 3 patients had spent about 4 weeks in Israel in July/August [2018] and had visited affected bodies of water in the Golan Heights with various fresh water exposure (kayaking, swimming, or white-water-rafting). The 1st patient was a 16-year-old male who returned to the US in the 1st week of August [2018] and one week later developed general lethargy, fever, headache, and myalgia. He subsequently presented with signs of meningitis. The diagnosis of leptospirosis was made with a commercially available IgM ELISA-assay with a positive convalescent sample one month later. The 2nd patient was a 16 year-old female who had started to experience intermittent fevers, headaches, neck pain and myalgia while still in Israel. Upon her return her headaches worsened and were associated with blurry vision. A diagnosis of aseptic meningitis secondary due to probable leptospirosis was made. However, diagnostic screening tests with the IgM ELISA-assay during the acute illness, and at subsequent follow-up one week later were negative. Lastly, a 16-year-old male presented with fever and headache 10 days after return. A teen co-traveler had been diagnosed and treated for leptospirosis. His diagnostic screening test (IgM ELISA-assay) for leptospirosis obtained during the acute presentation was negative. Leptospirosis-specific PCR from blood had been sent only for the first patient and was negative, and none of the three patients were available for additional testing with the microscopic agglutination (MAT) test. All received treatment with ceftriaxone, doxycycline or azithromycin for 5-7 days and had made full recovery.

Clinical manifestations of leptospirosis range from mild to severe. Most present with nonspecific symptoms of fever, headache, myalgia, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Aseptic meningitis as seen in 2 of our patients occurs frequently. The more severe icteric presentations (Weil syndrome) affect only about 10% of patients with leptospirosis. Laboratory diagnosis of leptospirosis remains a challenge. PCR-assays represent the test of choice during the acute illness but may not be readily available while ELISA for the detection of leptospira-specific IgM antibodies is most frequently used but is limited by variable sensitivities.(3,4) In the US a confirmatory MAT assay [microscopic agglutination test] is available through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

In summary, we would like to emphasize that due to the potential of a severe disease course alongside imperfect laboratory diagnostic tools, a high clinical suspicion of leptospirosis may be warranted when evaluating teen travelers with an acute febrile illness as they are likely to engage in fresh water activities even when returning from a destination not usually considered endemic for leptospirosis.(5)

[Leptospirosis is a notifiable disease in Israel for both humans and animals. When the disease is reported in animals, the relevant State Veterinary Officer is obliged by law to report the event at the earliest to the Public Health authorities, enabling timely preventive measures undertaken. Surveillance in animals is required to warrant effective protection of public health.

Leptospirosis used to be included in OIE's list for decades, prescribing requirements for international trade to prevent the transboundary spread of strains that are considered exotic in importing countries. However, during the 79th General Session of the OIE, Paris, May 2011, Leptospirosis was removed from the OIE list of diseases. The following text on the meeting's discussions was included on page 221 of the conference's report (http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/About_us/docs/pdf/A_FR_2011_PUB.pdf):

"Removal of leptospirosis from the OIE list of diseases:
Dr Barcos stated that the OIE Code was not only used for the purposes of international trade, but was highly useful in developing national legislation and setting up programmes and activities. He added that the countries of the Americas had called for leptospirosis not to be excluded from the OIE list, as this would leave Members without a legal basis and technical reference.

Dr Alex Thiermann, President of the Code Commission, replied that, given the endemic nature of this disease worldwide, it was inappropriate to keep it in the Code. However, he said that the chapter on leptospirosis in the Manual would remain."

The Manual's chapter 2.1.12 Leptospirosis, adopted by World Assembly of Delegates of the OIE in May 2014, is available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.12_LEPTO.pdf.

In late 2016, a dairy operation in northern Israel was found severely affected by _Leptospira interrogans_ serovar Pomona, hitherto uncommon in Israel. It was suspected that the bacterium may had been introduced by calves imported for local fattening, kept on the same premises; see commentary with additional details and (pending) questions in ProMED-mail post archive number 20170202.4811833.

The identity of the leptospira strain(s) which is/are behind the recent event on the Golan Heights, involving hundreds of human patients, circulating in cattle and, most probably, wild boars, involving visitors from Germany and USA, is yet to be finalised and published. Similarly, results of the surveillance in animals is yet to be finalised and results published.

The Ministry of Health's ban on entrance/swimming in 6 bodies of water on the Golan Heights has not yet been withdrawn. - Mod.AS
