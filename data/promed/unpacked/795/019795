The death toll from the outbreak of African horse sickness [AHS] in Thailand stands at more than 150, according to media reports.

However, the confirmed death toll in Thailand's latest update to the World Organisation for Animal Health [OIE], dated 10 Apr 2020, stands at less than half that, with 5 additional deaths confirmed since last week's report.

The discrepancies will relate to delays in the official reporting of data and obtaining confirmation of the cause of death.

The country is fighting to contain the insect-borne virus, which kills a majority of the horses it infects.

Measures to contain the disease include the establishment of surveillance and containment zones, quarantine, movement restrictions, disinfection, and other control measures to contain the biting midges responsible for the spread of the infection.

Pictures have emerged on Facebook of stables being enclosed in plastic and being regularly fumigated in a bid to kill the biting insects and keep them away from horses.

AHS is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa. Horses are considered the most susceptible, with nearly 90 percent dying if infected. It kills roughly half of infected mules and 10% of donkeys. However, infected African donkeys and mules rarely show signs of disease.

People are required to report any sudden death or suspected cases to the Department of Livestock Development.

Deaths to date have been confined to 6 provinces, Nakhon Ratchasima, Prachuap Khiri Khan, Chon Buri, Phetchaburi, Chaiyaphum and Ratchaburi.

Local media quote a Thai official as saying 154 horses have died among 835 horses kept at 32 farms across 4 of the provinces.

The worst-hit region is Nakhon Ratchasima's Pak Chong district. This is where the 1st death was recorded.

Officials say controlling the movement of equines will be crucial in controlling the disease, the area 150 km of the outbreak area being most crucial.

The benefits and risks associated with the use of a vaccine are being considered by authorities.

[On Fri 10 Apr 2020, Thailand submitted to the OIE its follow-up report No. 2 on the continuing AHS event, adding 2 new outbreaks, of which one was in the province Ratchaburi and the other one in the province Phetchaburi. The report included the following epidemiological comments:

"Four samples (equine blood and serum) were sent to the Pirbright Institute (United Kingdom) for checking serotype on 31 Mar 2020, and the results were positive for African horse sickness (AHS) disease. All 4 samples were diagnosed as serotype 1 of AHS virus. Those samples were sent by a private veterinarian. However, the Department of Livestock Development (DLD, competent authority of veterinary service in Thailand) will send more samples from other outbreak spots to check the serotype in 2 or more OIE Reference Laboratories for AHS soon." A link to the 3 reports and an interactive map presenting the 5 outbreaks reported as of 10 Apr 2020 are available at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=33768.

The following information on the event has been published by the Non-Vesicular Reference Laboratory (NVRL) at The Pirbright Institute, UK, on 9 Apr 2020: "Samples from Thailand were confirmed African horse sickness virus (AHSV) positive by Pirbright scientists, and further testing established that AHSV serotype 1 had caused the outbreak; the 1st time that this serotype has been seen outside of Africa.

AHSV is spread mainly by _Culicoides_ biting midges, and Thailand has several species that have previously been implicated in the spread of viruses. There are 9 serotypes of virus, and knowing which is involved in an outbreak is important in choosing an effective vaccine, the only certain way of controlling epidemics. In populations of horses that have never been exposed to the disease, case fatality rates can reach 80-90 percent, although zebra and donkeys generally suffer much milder disease" (see: https://www.pirbright.ac.uk/news/2020/04/pirbright-confirms-african-horse-sickness-outbreak-thailand).

Available AHS vaccines are live-attenuated. It may be expected that if all current outbreaks in Thailand are caused by a single serotype, namely AHS serotype 1, the authorities will prefer to apply a monovalent vaccine against the said serotype. - Mod.AS
