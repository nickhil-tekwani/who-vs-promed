Unusual scrapie type found
--------------------------
The Veterinary Laboratories Agency has informed the Department for
Environment Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), the Devolved Administrations,
and the Food Standards Agency, of a type of scrapie not previously seen in
the UK. The VLA and other European laboratories with expertise in
scrapie-like diseases have analyzed tissue samples from the sheep.
A meeting of the scientific experts who performed these tests concluded
that this case could not be considered to be BSE in sheep, although it does
not behave like known types of scrapie either. Further investigation will
be needed before more can be said about how this unusual result should be
described, according to DEFRA.
The Voluntary Scrapie Flocks Scheme, part of the National Scrapie Plan,
provides free scrapie genotype testing of all sheep on the eligible farm.
Scrapie susceptible animals -- NSP type 2, 3, 4 and 5 rams and type 4 and 5
females -- identified on these farms will be culled and replaced with stock
that is more resistant.

DEFRA investigates an unusual scrapie case
------------------------------------------
The VLA and other European laboratories with expertise in scrapie-like
diseases have now applied several rapid diagnostic methods to tissue
samples from a sheep with suspected scrapie. Some of the methods have
indicated that the case does not appear to resemble previously recognized
cases of scrapie and, although there were differences, it had some
characteristics similar to experimental BSE in sheep and also to an
experimental strain of sheep scrapie. More importantly, though, microscopic
analysis of brain material showed that the case neither resembled
previously recognized types of scrapie or experimental BSE in sheep.
A meeting of the scientific experts who performed these analyses, held on
30 Mar 2004, concluded that this case could not be considered to be BSE in
sheep, although it does not behave like known types of scrapie either.
Further investigation will be needed before more can be said about how this
unusual result should be described.
DEFRA's chief scientific adviser, Professor Howard Dalton, said "The UK,
and especially the VLA, have played an important part in improving the
diagnostic methods available for identifying TSEs in sheep. As we continue
to assess more samples with these improved methods, it is likely that we
will continue to find samples, such as this, which fall outside our current
knowledge of the disease. DEFRA, as it does with all research, will
continue to consult scientific experts to ensure that we are investigating
these cases using the best available techniques and methods."
The National Scrapie Plan remains unaffected by this new result and SEAC
[Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee] will be consulted in the
near future.
Notes for editors:
1. Scrapie is a fatal neurological sheep disease belonging to a group of
diseases called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), including
BSE in cattle and CJD in humans. It has been present in the national flock
for over 250 years. It is not considered to be transmissible to humans.
2. There is a theoretical risk that BSE could be present in sheep, masked
by scrapie, but it has not been found naturally occurring in sheep.
3. There is as yet no definitive diagnostic method that can rapidly
distinguish different TSEs, for example, scrapie from BSE. Consequently,
from time to time the scrapie surveillance programs in EU member states
throw up unusual results that merit further investigations (DEFRA press
release 371/03 refers <http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2004/../2003/030911a.htm>.
4. The VLA have applied several different methods to the sample to compare
it to a wide range of previously detected scrapie cases, experimental BSE
in sheep, and an experimental strain of scrapie, termed CH1461. 2 main
methods have been used in this analysis:
a. Western blot (WB)
This involves taking a sample of the brain and treating it with an enzyme
-- proteinase k -- to destroy the normal prion protein (PrPC). The diseased
form of the protein (PrPSc) is able to withstand this treatment and is then
separated from other cellular material on a gel. A blot is taken of the gel
and the PrPSc is visualized using specific antibodies.
b. Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
This involves taking thin slices of the brain, and by using special
(antibody) markers to detect the PrPSc it is possible to see disease
specific patterns of PrPSc distribution in the brain under a microscope.
The Western blot method found that the sample did not appear to resemble
previously recognized cases of scrapie and, although there were some
differences, some characteristics were similar to experimental BSE in sheep
and also the experimental strain of sheep scrapie, CH1461. IHC found that
it neither resembled previously recognized types of scrapie or experimental
BSE in sheep
5. The tissue sample has now been analyzed using a total of 5 different
diagnostic methods claiming to be able to differentiate between scrapie and
experimental BSE in sheep. 2 were performed at the VLA and 3 were performed
in other European laboratories.
6. The VLA is the European Reference Laboratory for TSEs and is responsible
for coordinating such investigations into unusual cases. Their findings
will be considered by the European Food Safety Authority's committee of TSE
experts and in the UK by the SEAC.
7. The genotype of the suspect sheep was ARQ/ARQ which is known to be
susceptible to some strains of scrapie and, in experiments, to BSE.

Scrapie Plan is published on the Defra internet at

Concerns raised over fall in reported scrapie cases
---------------------------------------------------
Farmers could be storing up trouble for themselves in the next human food
health scare by failing to report cases of the fatal sheep brain infection
scrapie. Although there is a legal requirement to report scrapie, some
state vets now believe that only happens for about 1 in 10 infected sheep
and that more than 5000 flocks in the UK have had at least 1 case, not the
500 or so recorded. It is also understood that underreporting has become
significantly worse in the run-up to a European Union scheme this summer
that can include whole-flock slaughter and no sheep on a farm for 3 years.
Unofficial figures indicate that during a period when, on average, reports
of about 100 cases of scrapie were expected in the UK, there has been 1.
The long term problem with underreporting is that scrapie is a
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy similar to BSE in cattle that has
been linked with more than 130 cases of the fatal human variant CJD. Since
BSE was identified as a human health risk more than 8 years ago, the
possibility that scrapie might be "masking" BSE in sheep has been raised
several times.
5 years ago this Apr, SEAC said: "There remains the possibility that BSE in
sheep might behave like scrapie and have been sustained in some sheep." It
made 20 recommendations for further research and surveillance and media
headlines at the time included the possibility that the UK's 35 million to
40 million sheep might all be slaughtered and incinerated.
There have been several scares since then -- not helped by 1 botched
large-scale test that mixed sheep brains for analysis with those of cattle
-- and another "BSE in sheep" alarm always seems imminent. As well as
testing hundreds of sheep brains for any sign of BSE, a national scrapie
plan was introduced with the clear intention that if scrapie were
eradicated, the possibility of it hiding BSE would be removed. The
voluntary scheme concentrates on encouraging breeding only from ewes and
rams showing genetic resistance to scrapie and slaughtering those that are
susceptible.
On 5 Apr 2004, the latest development in this scheme, run by DEFRA, was
announced, and is open to farmers who have had a case of scrapie confirmed
since July 1998. Being accepted for the "voluntary scrapie flocks" scheme
will provide free genotype tests, compensation for culled animals and
assistance to buy scrapie-resistant rams. About 90 Scots flocks could be
eligible, more than half of them on Shetland. The island virtually has a
"closed flock" health policy and apparently the highest incidence of
scrapie in Scotland, almost certainly because its farmers have been working
to eradicate the disease for 20 years and all cases are reported.

[The Scotsman's item [3], published one day before DEFRA's news release,
underlines the importance of improved reporting. At present, there is no
indication that BSE has infected sheep in field conditions, but such a
scenario has not been refuted. One may assume that the reporting quality in
other countries is similar to that of the UK. For background on BSE and
sheep, the reader may refer to postings 20021119.5847 and 20020106.3180. -
