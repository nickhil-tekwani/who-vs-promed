Kagera coffee farms hit by wilt disease
---------------------------------------
Coffee farmers in Kagera Region have suffered a monetary loss of over
Sh 243 million after coffee wilt disease ravaged their farms killing
over 55 000 robusta coffee trees and causing a loss of more than 160
tonnes of clean coffee, according to the annual report of the Tanzania
Coffee Research Institute.

[Coffee wilt disease (CWD, also called tracheomycosis) is caused by
the fungus _Gibberella xylarioides_. Of the 2 coffee species grown
commercially, _Coffea arabica_(arabica or highland coffee) and _Coffea
canephora_ (robusta or lowland coffee), it affects only robusta
varieties. Previously, the disease only occurred sporadically in
Africa, but it has become more virulent and is now considered a major
constraint to African coffee production.

CWD can attack all stages of growth and infected plants show 100 per
cent mortality. Symptoms include wilting, defoliation, and streaks in
the wood and occur sequentially until all branches are killed. Berries
ripen prematurely and dry up.

Pathogen spread occurs with infected plant material (firewood,
seedlings), contaminated soil or tools, by wind, water, and mechanical
means. While cultural practices have shown some success in disease
management, crop varieties with higher levels of CWD resistance appear
to be the most promising approach. CWD resistant varieties are being
developed, but in the past problems were encountered in the region
with distributing them to farmers.
