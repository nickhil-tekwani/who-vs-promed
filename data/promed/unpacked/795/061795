Last year [2006] it was west-central Indiana. This year [2007],
southern Indiana is experiencing an outbreak of a fatal deer disease
known as epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD).
According to information from Indiana Department of Natural Resource
Deer Management Biologist, Jim Mitchell, the disease is starting
earlier than the 2006 outbreak and could cause "significant wild deer
mortality in southern Indiana this year [2007]."
The current outbreak is centered in Greene, Clay, Owen, Parke,
Putnam, Sullivan, Vermillion, Fountain, and Vigo counties, but has
also been reported in Illinois, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee.
The disease is transmitted by small biting flies known as midges and
the affected deer suffer flu-like symptoms including a high fever.
They will often seek water to cool down and many dead deer are found
near water. Last year's [2006] outbreak was 1st noticed when deer
carcasses were found along Sugar Creek by canoeists.
Hunters shouldn't worry if they take a few common-sense precautions.
Any deer that appears sick or weak shouldn't be harvested. Hunters or
hikers can report sick deer to the local District Wildlife Biologist,
Conservation Officer, or the Board of Animal Health.
There appears to be no risk of illness from being in contact with
EHD-affected deer, but hunters are advised to wear gloves while
cleaning the animal or handling the meat and to make sure meat is
cooked thoroughly to kill disease organisms or bacteria. EHD should
not be confused with chronic wasting disease, which has not been seen
so far in Indiana.
The disease will disappear once there have been several hard freezes
that kill the disease-carrying midges. Deer in areas affected last
year [2006] should not suffer due to built-up immunity.

[Given the close relationship to blue tongue virus it is somewhat
surprising that EHD is not a reportable disease in Indiana. The
Midwest has been unusually dry, to the point of corn crop failure in
many of the Midwest states. So it should not be unexpected to find
this disease earlier than last year (2006).
