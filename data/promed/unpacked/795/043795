China: Suspected Case of Japanese Encephalitis in Hong Kong Now Confirmed
--------------------------------------------------
The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (1
Nov 2004) confirmed that serology tests on blood samples of a 5-year-old
boy in Sha Kong Tsuen, Yuen Long, yielded a positive result for Japanese
encephalitis (JE). This is the 4th JE case reported in 2004. The boy
developed fever, runny nose, sore throat, vomiting and diarrhea on 16 Oct
2004. He was admitted to Tuen Mun Hospital on 19 Oct 2004 and is in stable
condition.
Dr Thomas Tsang, Consultant of the CHP, said at a press briefing today that
the CHP was conducting active case finding in the neighbourhood of the
boy's residence, and appropriate follow-up for symptomatic individuals
would be arranged.
"People who live in the surrounding areas of Sha Kong Tsuen can call the
CHP hotline 2575 1848 for health information. The hotline is open until 9
pm today and during office hours on following days," Dr Tsang said.
The CHP is organizing a health talk for residents on Wednesday (3 Nov
2004). Blood tests will be offered to residents on that occasion. Dr Tsang
said that investigation so far does not show epidemiological linkage with
the previous 3 local cases confirmed earlier in 2004, adding that at
present there were no other suspected JE cases known to the CHP.
FEHD's Pest Control Officer-in-charge of the Food and Environmental Hygiene
Department (FEHD), Mr Yuen Ming-chi, said at the briefing that the major
vector for JE in Hong Kong, the mosquito _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_, had
been collected at Sha Kong Tsuen and its surrounding areas.
"The FEHD has been conducting anti-mosquito operations around piggeries on
a regular basis. Larvicides have been applied to control mosquito breeding.
The department will step up anti-mosquito work in the area where the
patient lived," Mr Yuen said.
Noting that there is concern about whether mangroves found at the seashore
in the area were a breeding ground of the JE vector, Mr Yuen said salted
water is not the natural habitat for _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_. "The
recorded local _Culex_ species that breed in salted water is _Culex
sitiens_, which is not a vector for transmission of JE," he said.
Referring to reports of mosquitoes breeding in the septic tanks in Sha Kong
Tsuen, Mr Yuen said any person found accumulating water containing larvae
or pupae of mosquitoes on their premises would be liable for prosecution
with a maximum fine of $25 000 [USD 3213] plus a daily fine of $450 [USD
58] if convicted.
Meanwhile, the AFCD staff have inspected several pig farms in the vicinity
of the boy's residence and found their hygienic conditions satisfactory.
Pig farmers have been reminded of the need to keep their place clean and
carry out anti-mosquito measures. The AFCD will continue to intensify
inspections of pig farms in the Lau Fau Shan area.
Japanese encephalitis is a notifiable disease in Hong Kong. It is
transmitted by culicine mosquitoes, and transmission reaches its dead end
in humans. From 1992 to 2004, there were a total of 10 sporadic cases
reported in Hong Kong, comprising one local case in 1996, one imported case
in 1997, one imported case in 2001, 2 imported cases in 2002, one local
case in 2003, and 4 local cases so far this year.
To prevent JE, members of the public are advised to take the following
measures when visiting areas with mosquito-transmitted diseases: Wear
long-sleeved clothes and trousers; use insect repellent over exposed parts
of the body when outdoors; and use mosquito screens or nets when the room
is not air-conditioned.

[The investigation of the preceding 3 local cases of Japanese encephalitis
identified in the Hong Kong SAR this year did not reveal evidence of onward
transmission of the virus. The increased number of local cases this year,
however, requires continued vigilance. - Mod.CP]
