Name, shame & blame in reporting 991115195706

From: Ian Smith <Smith@eppo.fr>

We note a recent ProMED-mail comment that EPPO highlights "incidents of
importation of plant pests from countries that have not reported their
presence".
We do indeed, but this point needs a little further clarification:
1) we only report incidents which are officially communicated to us by the
member countries of EPPO (the importing countries in this case);
2) we discriminate, if necessary, concerning the pest in question. Most of
the pests mentioned in these reports are already quite widespread, as least
in the countries neighbouring the exporting country. The reports are not
surprising. The "non-reporting" which is apparently "blamed" is not
significant. There is no international obligation to report these plant
pests, which may indeed be of no particular interest in the exporting
country, only to the chance importer on the other side of the world.
3) as far as we know, the reports are not of a nature to have any dramatic
impact on the exporting country's reputation or trade. We would have to
tread a lot more carefully in that case. If the exporting country concerned
is an EPPO country, we always check with it. The EPPO members have an
obligation to reply to us. In the case of other countries, we check if we
feel it is necessary to do so, but we cannot be sure to get a reply.
4) we do not, in any case, add a new geographical record to our database
showing that the pest is present in the exporting country. This can only be
based on a genuine record in the country. Exported consignments can quite
easily become infested in transit.
If we really want to highlight the presence of a pest in a country, we
present a specific Reporting Service item about it, giving our sources.

[Of course official international agencies have to abide by the wishes of
their member countries concerning reporting. The significant phrase above
is: "the reports are not of a nature to have any dramatic impact on the
exporting country's reputation or trade. We would have to tread a lot more
carefully in that case." So the really serious cases of importation are
not normally divulged by EPPO any more than they are by WHO. Nevertheless,
EPPO does report the name of the exporting country in many cases, whilst
WHO almost never does so. All of which highlights the need for an
independent reporting system promoting transparency.
Meanwhile, we understand that WHO has raised with WTO -- the World Trade
Organization -- the problems caused to disease reporting by unwarranted
trade restrictions imposed on countries which notify cholera & other
diseases. - Mod.JW
