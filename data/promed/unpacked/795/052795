Officials from the Costa Rican Social Security Fund (CCSS) and the ministries of health of Costa Rica and Nicaragua identified 15 people positive for malaria in the border community of La Trocha, after an epidemiological sweep carried out in various parts of the area.

Dr Melvin Anchía Villalobos, epidemiologist for the integrated health service delivery network Huetar Norte, explained that the bilateral work developed between the two countries favors malaria prevention and control strategies.

"It is exhausting work because you have to go from house to house and weather and access conditions are difficult, but we managed to do responsible work that facilitates decision-making and the activation of protocols to avoid more infections," Dr Anchía said.

The epidemiologist also commented that the migratory flow favors the mobility of the disease and only with strategies integrated by both nations can the transmission that can be derived from the outbreak be contained. Of the 15 cases detected, 8 correspond to Costa Ricans and 7 to Nicaraguans.

Malaria is a disease that can be fatal and is caused by parasites that are transmitted to humans through the bite of infected _Anopheles_ mosquitoes. The most common symptoms that a patient may present are:
- generalized body pain.
- fever between 39 and 40 deg C [102.2 and 104 deg F]
- chills
- yellowish skin color changes
- loss of hunger
- sweating
- headache
- tiredness, fatigue
- nausea
- vomit
- diarrhea
- abdominal pain

To diagnose malaria, a blood test is necessary to observe the parasite directly under a microscope.

The CCSS will maintain active surveillance jointly with the health authorities of Nicaragua and Costa Rica for the timely detection of malaria and initiation of treatment.

"These efforts are vital because they allow immediate action and cutting that chain of disease between people. The 15 patients diagnosed with the disease have already received treatment, as well as the contacts of the cases," said the CCSS epidemiologist.

The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) is part of the work team that seeks additional strategies to strengthen the binational work they initiated with the intervention of the outbreak in the border cordon with Nicaragua.
