The Riverside County Department of Animal Services today [31 Oct 2020] warned horse owners to beware of an equine influenza outbreak having killed an estimated 3 dozen wild burros in the region.

County and state officials are monitoring the outbreak while urging horse owners to check in with their veterinarians about booster vaccines for previously vaccinated animals. Horse owners are also being advised to ensure their animals are not exposed to sick burros by moving their animals away from fence lines in areas where the burros frequent.

The 1st burro death occurred about 2 weeks ago, and the death count is expected to rise, according to Animal Services officials. The highly contagious virus is specific to equids -- such as horses, mules and donkeys -- with severe signs more common in donkeys and mules, as well as in younger horses, ages 1 to 5, said Animal Services spokesman John Welsh.

Older horses typically exhibit milder signs, and the disease does not affect other species of animals, he said. Signs of the virus include fever, edema and enlarged lymph nodes.

The disease -- one of the most common infectious diseases of the respiratory tract in horses -- spreads rapidly through groups of equids in aerosolized droplets dispersed by coughing or through fomite transmission, meaning objects or surfaces which have become infected, officials said.

Shared waterers, feeders, and other equipment can transfer the disease from one animal to another.

Emily Nietrzeba, an equine specialist veterinarian with the California Department of Food and Agriculture, said humans cannot contract the disease, but people can carry the infection and transmit the virus between horses.

County officials are reminding the public that feeding the wild burros is against the law and urged people to avoid all contact with the burros, especially anyone who owns horses.

[The fact that the wild burros are affected by equine influenza and dying from it is very sad. Can it transmit from the burros to your horses? Yes. Horses and burros are both equids, so the disease can affect both of them. Please have your horse vaccinated against equine influenza.

Equine influenza is a flu virus and will transmit between equids.

While this article indicates you can transmit influenza to your horse, I cannot find any evidence of such an event. The CDC, and many journals and scientific sites do not mention such an event. We know many animals, and humans have flu, and some can transmit between species. However, as of this writing, I can find no evidence of human flu strains transmitting to horses. Perhaps this veterinarian in California has such evidence, and it has not yet been published.

"Equine influenza is highly contagious and spreads rapidly among naive horses. Horses 1-5 years old are the most susceptible to infection. Orthomyxovirus A/equine-2 was 1st recognized in 1963 as a cause of widespread epidemics and has subsequently become endemic in many countries. China, Japan, and Australia experienced devastating epidemics of equine influenza affecting tens of thousands of horses in 2007. Before that, equine influenza had not been reported in China since 1993, in Japan since 1972, and had never been reported in Australia.

"Endemicity is maintained by sporadic clinical cases and by inapparent infection in susceptible horses introduced into the population by birth, through waning immunity, or after movement from other areas or countries. A carrier state is not recognized for equine influenza. The clinical outcome after viral exposure largely depends on immune status; clinical disease varies from a mild, inapparent infection to severe disease in susceptible animals. Influenza is rarely fatal except in donkeys, zebras, and debilitated horses. Transmission occurs by inhalation of [airborne] respiratory secretions. Epidemics arise when one or more acutely infected horses are introduced into a susceptible group. The epidemiologic outcome depends on the antigenic characteristics of the circulating virus and the immune status of a given population of horses at time of exposure. Frequent natural exposure or regular vaccination may contribute to the degree of antigenic drift seen with specific strains of A/equine-2 virus in some parts of the world.

"The incubation period of influenza is approximately 1-3 days. Clinical signs begin abruptly and include high fever (up to 106 F) [41.1 C], serous nasal discharge, submandibular lymphadenopathy, and coughing that is dry, harsh, and nonproductive. Depression, anorexia, and weakness are frequently seen. Clinical signs usually last less than 3 days in uncomplicated cases. Influenza virus replicates within respiratory epithelial cells, resulting in destruction of tracheal and bronchial epithelium and cilia. Cough develops early in the course of infection and may persist for several weeks. Nasal discharge, although scant and serous initially, may become mucopurulent due to secondary bacterial infection. Mildly affected horses recover uneventfully in 2-3 weeks; severely affected horses may convalesce as long as 6 months. Recovery may be hastened by complete restriction of strenuous physical activity. Respiratory tract epithelium takes approximately 21 days to regenerate; during this time, horses are susceptible to development of secondary bacterial complications such as pneumonia, pleuropneumonia, and chronic bronchitis. Complications are minimized by restricting exercise, controlling dust, providing superior ventilation, and practicing good stable hygiene. Primary complications of vasculitis, myositis, and myocarditis are seen infrequently."
