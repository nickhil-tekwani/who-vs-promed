The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) is advising consumers not to consume the viscera (internal organs) of Dungeness crab caught near Bodega Head and Russian River in Sonoma County. This warning is due to the detection of elevated levels of domoic acid, a naturally occurring toxin.

While domoic acid levels may vary, consumers should always follow these best preparation practices to avoid any inadvertent exposure to domoic acid that might be found in the crab's viscera. When whole crab are cooked in liquid, domoic acid may leach from the viscera into the cooking liquid. Water or broth used to cook whole crab should be discarded and not used to prepare dishes such as sauces, broths, soups or stews (for example, cioppino or gumbo), stocks, roux, dressings or dips. Cooking crabs neither decreases nor destroys the toxin. The viscera usually contain higher levels of domoic acid than the meat, so consumers are advised to discard the viscera and cooking liquids.

Symptoms of domoic acid poisoning can occur within 30 minutes to 24 hours after eating toxic seafood. In mild cases, symptoms may include vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, headache and dizziness. These symptoms disappear within several days. In severe cases, the victim may experience trouble breathing, confusion, cardiovascular instability, seizures, excessive bronchial secretions, permanent loss of short-term memory, coma or death.

CDPH continues to coordinate its efforts with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) https://www.wildlife.ca.gov/fishing/ocean/health-advisories and the fishing community to collect and test crab samples from the impacted areas until domoic acid levels have dissipated.

[A phytoplankton, in particular a microscopic diatom _Pseudonitzschia australis_, produces the neurotoxin domoic acid (DA). DA accumulates in the hippocampus of the brain and can cause seizures. DA accumulates in increasing amounts as it goes up the food chain. Anchovies and other prey feed on various algae and phytoplankton. If they feed when the algae and phytoplankton are toxic, then the toxin is passed onto the California sea lion and other marine mammals when they consume the anchovies or other food sources affected by this toxin. However, in this particular case, it would be passed into the broth, which could be consumed. It is important to heed these warnings.

As always, dose makes the toxin, and the effect on the person depends upon the amount they consume.

Diagnosis is made by the clinical signs of the individual and the history of crab consumption. Diagnosis may be possible by the detection of DA in serum, urine or feces of the affected individual. It can be diagnosed this way when dealing with affected sea lions or marine mammals. Usually, this detection is paired with finding the _Pseudonitzschia australis_ in the prey (likely anchovy, or crab) and in environmental samples. The water-soluble DA is rapidly excreted in the urine, making it a great sample for testing. However, as the algae species have variable toxicities and DA outbreaks are unpredictable, diagnosis can be difficult to determine.

We most often see sea lions affected because anchovies are affected. Therefore, if crabs are affected, it is likely that we will be seeing articles on other animals affected by DA. - Mod.TG
