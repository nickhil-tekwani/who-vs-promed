Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: Between May and June 2016 several submissions of pigeon mortality, with similar clinical presentation, were investigated. Notifiable diseases such as Newcastle disease, avian influenza and pigeon paramyxovirus were excluded through laboratory testing. Following further testing a reovirus was suspected however a conclusive diagnosis could not be made. In early 2017 cases were identified in other jurisdictions and a rotavirus (a virus in the family Reoviridae) was identified. Biosecurity advice is being provided to industry and affected individuals.

Control measures
Measures applied: vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

["Since mid-2016, high levels of mortalities in kept pigeons (racing and fancy) have occurred in lofts across some states of Australia (Western Australia, Victoria, New South Wales, South Australia). Clinical signs in affected birds have included depression, vomiting, diarrhoea, regurgitation and hunched postures. Birds that appeared sick usually died within 12 to 24 hours. A rotavirus (a member of the reoviridae family) was confirmed.

"Feral pigeons are likely to be susceptible to the virus. In Western Australia, feral pigeon (rock pigeon; _Columba livia_) mortalities occurred in a location close to an affected loft, with gross and histological findings consistent with the disease in the racing and fancy pigeons. In addition, rotavirus has been detected in faecal samples of several feral and native wild bird species overseas". https://www.wildlifehealthaustralia.com.au/DiseaseIncidents/OngoingIncidents.aspx
