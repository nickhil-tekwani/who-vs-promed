To cull, or not to cull? That is the question.
---------------------------------------------
I have been inundated with questions from locals as well as from
ProMED-mail readers about the surveillance program for Nipah virus in
Malaysia and the rationale for culling animals in pig farms. As I am not
directly involved with the laboratory testing of either animal or human
samples at this stage, my response must be interpreted with caution.
Here are some of the most frequently asked questions.
1. Is it justified to cull the animals based on IgG ELISA? This test is a
non-specific test and can give rise to cross-reactivity with Hendra virus
and possibly other paramyxoviruses. The results should be confirmed by the
more specific serum neutralization test (SNT). If there is a difference in
the two tests, then the result of SNT is more acceptable. [The test is
"non-specific" only in that it is not Nipah virus-specific. The decision
to cull these animals is [based on the uncertainty as to whether
antibody-positive animals still harbor the virus [i.e., are persistently
infected and are therefore infectious. The evidence in humans so far does
not suggest [persistent infections. Previously infected patients have not
transmitted the disease to their family members nor have we been able to
isolate the virus in follow-up Nipah patients. In the case of subacute
sclerosing panencephalitis due to [persistent infection with measles virus
(another paramyxovirus), transmission of the virus to contacts has not been
reported. [But this is not the case, of course, with acute measles. It
will not be difficult to test these animals by virus isolation or to
demonstrate seroconversion in antibody-negative young pigs (weaners and
porkers) in infected farms.
2. Why is there no evidence of sick animals in infected farms? From the
1999 Nipah virus outbreak, it was estimated that more than 80% of animals
in a farm become infected and about 3-5% of these become ill. Yet, farmers
who are good at recognizing this disease because of the prominent
respiratory and neurologic symptoms have not seen such animals this time.
If indeed there are, then they should be confirmed to be due to Nipah virus
by virus isolation or by significant antibody increase. [Of course, if the
serologic test results are aberrant and there are no sick animals, then
there is no evidence of disease.
3. Does [an IgM positive [serology from humans indicate recent infection?
It depends on the sensitivity of the ELISA test. We tell our students that
IgM is transient, and by the nature of the test it should decrease to an
undetectable level after a few weeks. In the case of the Nipah virus ELISA,
we have detected the persistence of specific IgM even one year after
infection. There is also the problem of non-specificity of the test because
samples confirmed to be positive for other [paramyxoviral? viral
infections (measles included) give rise to a false positive in the Nipah
virus ELISA. Positive results, therefore should be interpreted along with
epidemiological information and clinical history.
The decision to cull or not to cull is not an easy call as it affects human
lives and the livelihood of many. However, such a decision should be based
on strong scientific evidence.

[That IgM antibody can persist even for a year after infection supports the
contention of former Moderator C. H. Calisher, who was and is strongly
insistent that serological confirmation of a viral infection cannot be made
with a single serum sample, not for West Nile virus infection, not for
yellow fever virus infection, not for Nipah virus infection, not for any
virus infection. Many years ago Barry Beaty and Don Burke, studying La
Crosse virus infections and Japanese encephalitis virus infections,
respectively, demonstrated that IgM antibody to those viruses can persist
in a small proportion of individuals and concluded that not only might
virus be persisting in these people but that there was a correlation of
persistence of IgM antibody and severity of outcome. In any event, finding
IgM antibody is not a clear-cut indication of recent infection. Paired
acute- and convalescent-phase samples are required if one is to have the
opportunity to make a confirmed serodiagnosis.
These comments by Ken Lam are straightforward and informative and we are
grateful to him for sending them along. Given the obvious and extensive
antigenic cross-reactions among the many paramyxoviruses, serodiagnosis of
Nipah virus infections, Hendra virus infections, and other paramyxovirus
infections in humans (and perhaps in pigs, bats, and other species) is a
difficult task, one requiring experience and consideration. It may even
become a field of study.
Recent postings on ProMED-mail concerning the Nipah situation in Malaysia
have lacked essential details, and it has seemed at times that humans in
Malaysia were serving as sentinels for pig infections. Ken Lam's
authoritative comments and analysis are reassuring, because in the past it
had seemed that non-university government laboratories in Malaysia have
been unable to undertake IgM antibody capture ELISA tests that could be
confirmed in an independent (Australian) laboratory. For several months
after the first recognition of Nipah virus in Malaysia the authorities were
still insisting that affected people (and pigs) were infected with Japanese
encephalitis virus, based on IgM capture ELISA tests specific for antibody
to that virus. Open and continued consultation between Malaysian and
non-Malaysian scientists is essential to maintain confidence in the efforts
of the Malaysian government to control Nipah virus infection in humans and
domestic animals. - Mods.CHC/CP
