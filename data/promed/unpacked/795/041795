Dak Lak native 2nd patient to recover from bird flu
---------------------------------
A 31-year-old man from Dak Lak has become the 2nd patient to be successfully treated for bird flu (H5N1) so far this year [2012] in Viet Nam. The Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City [HCMC] has announced that the patient, has recovered and been discharged from the hospital on 24 Mar [2012] after 19 days of intensive treatment.

[The patient] was admitted to the hospital on 5 Mar [2012] with high fever, fatigue and respiratory problems. He was put on a breathing machine and kept in quarantine.

His family said they had previously slaughtered and eaten a sick home-raised chicken more than 10 days earlier. [He] later developed a cough and high fever. They said the entire flock of chicken also died.

[He] was treated with medicine at home for the 1st 3 days after falling sick. When his condition did not improve even after he was admitted to the Dak Lak Hospital, he was transferred to the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in HCMC where tests showed he was infected with the H5N1 virus.

In a previous case, the hospital successfully treated a 22-year-old bird flu patient from Binh Duong Province who was discharged on 6 Mar [2012].

Viet Nam has so far this year [2012] reported 4 bird flu infections, 2 of which have been fatal, after a 20-month absence.

On 21 Mar [2012], the Animal Health Department announced that Viet Nam was free of bird flu. According to relevant regulations, a province is considered free from an infectious disease if there is no new infection in 3 weeks.

[The initial report of this case indicated that the source of infection was "a mystery" (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20120309.1065163). That mystery has now been solved, and is another unfortunate case of transmission of H5N1 virus from ill poultry to people in close physical contact with them. Fortunately, this individual survived his infection.

Prevention of H5N1 infections from popping up in small, back yard poultry flocks is problematic. In Viet Nam, there have now been a total of 123 cases and 61 fatalities since H5N1 virus was first detected in the country.
