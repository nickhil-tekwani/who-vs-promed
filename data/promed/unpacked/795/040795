Health officials say a south Weld County man has died after contracting [a] hantavirus [infection].

The Weld County Department of Public Health and Environment announced Thursday [25 Jun 2015] the man, whose name has not been released, died after he apparently contracted the disease while repairing his home. Investigators say he was working in an enclosed space in the presence of rodent droppings.

The health department did not say when the man died.

People are infected by breathing in the virus during direct contact with rodents or by disturbing dust and feces from mice nests or surfaces contaminated with mice droppings.

Symptoms include muscle aches, fatigue, high fever, dizziness, headaches, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain, which can lead to death.

Hantavirus [infections are] rare, with an average of 4 cases a year in Colorado.

[Although not stated in the report above, the specific hantavirus involved in this and the previous hantavirus pulmonary syndrome cases in Colorado is probably Sin Nombre virus, which is endemic in deer mice (_Peromyscus maniculatus_) there. Although cases of Sin Nombre virus infection are relatively rare, they can be very serious, as the 4 HPS deaths in Colorado this year (2015) indicate. The public needs to be aware of the circumstances that lead to risk of virus transmission. This is particularly important during spring and summer, when cabins and other outbuildings that have been closed for several months are reopened and cleaned out, raising dust that may be contaminated with virus from deer mice hosts.
