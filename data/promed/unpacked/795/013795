We report the 1st isolation in our country [Chile] of _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ carbapenemase (KPC)-producing [microorganism] in a patient admitted from Italy. The patient has non-Hodgkin lymphoma treatment and renal failure on hemodialysis, and he was hospitalized several times in Italy. On 28 Feb [2012, he was] admitted to a hospital in Santiago [Chile] to continue treatment. During hospitalization, he developed fever and microbiological studies were performed. _K. pneumoniae_ was isolated from urine. The antibiogram showed resistance to quinolones, aminoglycosides, cephalosporins, and carbapenems and susceptible only to tigecycline and colistin.

The presence of this bacterium in urine was interpreted as asymptomatic bacteriuria, as central venous catheter-associated blood stream infection due to another organism (_Achromobacter denitrificans_) was demonstrated.

Modified-Hodge test and boronic test were positive. [The modified Hodge and the boronic acid tests are phenotypic tests used to detect the presence of KPCs. The boronic acid test uses antibiotic susceptibility discs impregnated with boronic acid, an inhibitor of serine beta-lactamases, such as KPCs (see below).] The PCR (polymerase chain reaction) showed the presence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases TEM and SHV and KPC-2/KPC-3 carbapenemase. We did not detect the presence of other class A serine carbapenemases or metallo-beta-lactamases.

In Chile there had been [previously] no strains of KPC-producing _K. pneumoniae_. The mechanism for carbapenem resistance in our environment had been the overproduction of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-type beta-lactamases or overproduction of AmpC beta-lactamase plus changes in porins. Given the great potential for spread of KPCs, strengthening infection control measures to reduce the risk of transmission is very important.

In 2009 the CDC published recommendations for the management of _Enterobacteriaceae_ that are resistant to carbapenems (Guidance for Control of Infections with Carbapenem-Resistant or Carbapenemase-Producing _Enterobacteriaceae_ in Acute Care Facilities), which are available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5810a4.htm.

[Carbapenems are a class of beta-lactam antibiotics that includes ertapenem, doripenem, imipenem, and meropenem. Carbapenems historically have been antibiotics of last resort to treat many infections due to carbapenem-sensitive multidrug-resistant Gram negative bacilli. KPCs (_Klebsiella pneumoniae_ carbapenemases) are a type of beta-lactamase that degrades and thereby confers resistance to carbapenem antibiotics. Resistance to carbapenems can also arise by high-level production of a chromosomal AmpC cephalosporinase combined with decreased outer membrane permeability due to loss or alteration of porins (bacterial transmembrane proteins that constitute a channel for influx of carbapenems into the periplasmic space) (Yigit H, Queenan AM, Anderson GJ, et al: Novel Carbapenem-Hydrolyzing _-Lactamase, KPC-1, from a Carbapenem-Resistant Strain of _Klebsiella pneumoniae_. Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2001; 45(4): 1151-61; available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC90438/).

There are several distinct carbapenemases, which fall into molecular classes A, B, C, and D. Classes A, C, and D have serine at the active site and class B has zinc at the active site. KPCs are class A carbapenemases; IMP (imipenemase), NDM-1 (New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1), and VIM (Verona integron-encoded metallo-beta-lactamase) are class B carbapenemases; and OXA-types (oxacillin-hydrolyzing) are class D carbapenemases.

KPCs (such as, KPC-1, -2, -3, -4, etc) are plasmid-encoded enzymes first found in _K. pneumoniae_ isolates (hence, the name). Subsequently, KPCs have been found in other organisms, including _Escherichia coli_, _Serratia marcescens_, _Klebsiella oxytoca_, _Citrobacter freundii_, _Enterobacter_ spp., _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, and _Salmonella enterica_. KPCs hydrolyze all beta-lactam antibiotics, that is, all penicillins, cephalosporins (including extended spectrum cephalosporins such as cefepime and ceftriaxone), and aztreonam, in addition to the carbapenems. The gene encoding KPC is frequently associated with other resistant genes (aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones). KPCs are now commonly encountered in the United States, and have also been reported in Israel, China, France, and Italy (Fontana C, Favaro M, Sarmati L, et al: Emergence of KPC-producing _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ in Italy. BMC Res Notes 201; 3:40; available at http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/3/40, as well as Colombia and Brazil in South America (Santa Catarina, Rio, and Sao Paulo) (Andrade LN, Curiao T, Ferreira JC, et al: Dissemination of blaKPC-2 by the spread of _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ clonal complex 258 clones (ST258, ST11, ST437) and plasmids (IncFII, IncN, IncL/M) among _Enterobacteriaceae_ species in Brazil. Antimicrob Agents Chemother 2011; 55(7): 3579-83; available at http://aac.asm.org/content/55/7/3579.long).

Patients at risk of infections caused by KPC-producing microorganisms include those with prolonged hospitalization, particularly in intensive care units, those who are critically ill and exposed to invasive devices (such as, ventilators or central venous catheters), and those receiving long courses of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Infections caused by KPC-producing microorganisms are associated with increased cost and high rates of morbidity and mortality, and they are difficult to treat as these microorganisms are resistant to almost all available antimicrobial agents. Often these organisms are only susceptible to tigecycline and colistin.

These KPC-producing organisms are easy to transfer from patient to patient. Hand hygiene is key to prevent the spread of these organisms and any other multidrug resistant microorganism. Infection control interventions in healthcare facilities aimed at preventing transmission of carbapenemase-producing isolates include their rapid recognition by the clinical microbiology laboratory when cultured from clinical specimens, placement of patients colonized or infected with these isolates on contact precautions, and in some circumstances, conducting point prevalence surveys or active-surveillance testing among high-risk patients (CDC: Guidance for control of infections with carbapenem-resistant or carbapenemase-producing _Enterobacteriaceae_ in acute care facilities. MMWR 2009; 58(10): 256-60; available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5810a4.htm).
