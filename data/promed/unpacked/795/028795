Diagnostic procedure in botulism diagnosis
------------------------------------------
In the National Veterinary and Food Research Institute (Finland) we use
primarily the mouse bioassay for botulism diagnosis. The contents of the
small intestine are filtered and diluted and injected either alone after
boiling or mixed with specific antisera against the different types of
botulin toxins. Samples of feed and feed stuffs are tested using the same
procedure.
In addition, the samples of feed, feed stuffs, and intestinal contents are
cultured anaerobically. The _C. botulinum_ strains isolated are diagnosed
using conventional bacteriological methods, and the type of bacterium and
toxin are confirmed with PCR.
