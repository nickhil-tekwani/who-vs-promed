From a One Health and practical point of view, one important differential diagnosis that needs to be considered in situations like this is Rift Valley fever. Work in the once vibrant Rockefeller funded Virology lab in the University of Ibadan by Tomori and others (see one reference below) clearly demonstrated RVFV circulation in Nigeria. Are the clinicians involved in situations such as in Taraba considering RVF as a differential diagnosis? Does lab capacity to diagnose evidence of RVFV exist?

Increased risk for Rift Valley fever transmission post flooding/heavy rainfall is well documented. It would be helpful if data on animal health patterns (especially abortions) and mosquito population dynamics post flooding can be obtained. In Taraba state, especially in the Mambilla Plateau region, there is large-scale livestock farming involving many animals. Without active animal health surveillance, animal illness events (e.g. abortions/neonatal mortalities) preceding human involvement could be missed, limiting the opportunity to incorporate such data into timely, preventive health measures, as expected in the true spirit of One Health.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. Shamsudeen Fagbo for his excellent comments and for reminding us of the possibility of Rift Valley fever (RVF) as a possible etiology for this outbreak. Dr. Fagbo raises excellent points and excellent questions to be addressed. While RVF has not been reported in Nigeria on ProMED-mail, the virus is definitely present in Northwest Africa, as can be verified through the reports of a major outbreak in Mauritania earlier this year (2012, see prior ProMED-mail posts below).

This moderator was not able to identify reports of actual documented outbreaks of RVF in Nigeria, but there are a number of serosurveys that have been conducted demonstrating the presence of antibodies to RVF-V in humans and in domestic farm animals in Nigeria (see references below).

More information from knowledgeable sources in the region would be greatly appreciated.

Adamawa state is located in the northeastern part of Nigeria. Bordering states include Borno to the northwest, Gombe to the west, and Taraba to the southwest. It shares its eastern border with Cameroon. For a map of Nigeria showing states, see http://www.mapsofworld.com/nigeria/nigeria-political-map.html.
