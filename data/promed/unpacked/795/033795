More African Horse Sickness; Lift of EU Ban Could be Delayed
-----------------------------------------------
According to a report on Iol.co.za, an online publication in South
Africa, African horse sickness (AHS) has been detected in the
Worcester and Robertson districts of the Western Cape, 12 km (about
7.5 miles) from the premises where the area's 1st case of AHS this
year [2006] was reported on the border between the 2 districts.

The publication revealed that about 300 cases have been reported in
KwaZulu-Natal (in the eastern part of the country).
"It is starting to look like an outbreak in the area, as the 1st
incident has not been an isolated case and turned out positive," Dr.
Gary Buhrmann, Western Cape Veterinary Services chief state vet for
the Boland, told the publication.
Infected horses are being treated, and quarantines are in place.
Officials are encouraging horse owners to vaccinate their animals
against the disease, keep the horses indoors where they have less
exposure to _Culicoides_ midges (which spread the disease), and to
use insect repellents. Many of the infected animals were not
vaccinated against AHS.
Burhmann told the publication that the EU was monitoring the AHS
situation in order to make a decision on the ban, which was eligible
for removal on 28 Mar 2006.

[AHS is an infectious but non-contagious viral disease affecting all
species of _equidae_, characterized by alterations in respiratory and
circulatory functions and high mortality rate. AHS is caused by an
orbivirus of the family _Reoviridae_, transmitted by at least 2
species of _Culicoides_. 9 different serotypes of the virus have been
described.
The recording of AHS in the Western Cape Province -- the only
province in South Africa regarded as free from the disease -- in 2004
was followed by a 2-year ban by the EU on imports of horses from
South Africa. The ban was due to elapse on 28 Mar 2006.

Data on the African Horse Sickness (AHS) serotype involved in the
current cases will be appreciated. AHS does not affect humans. - Mod.AS]
