[ref: A Hernandez-Morales et al. First report of _Pantoea stewartii_ subsp. _stewartii_ causing jackfruit bronzing disease in Mexico. J Plant Path. 2017; 99(3): DOI: 10.4454/jpp.v99i3.3969]
--------------------------------------------------------------------
"Jackfruit bronzing", an emerging disease caused by the bacterium _Pantoea stewartii_, had only been reported in the Philippines and Malaysia [ProMED-mail post 20170905.5294905]. It is characterized by yellow-orange to reddish discoloration of affected pulps and rags.

In autumn 2016, the disease was suspected in major growing areas in Mexico, where jackfruits with bronzing were observed and collected. Ten bacterial isolates with characteristics particular to _Pantoea_ spp. were obtained. The cpsD and hrpS genes obtained with primers specific to _Pantoea stewartii_ showed 98-99 per cent similarity to reference strains of subsp. _stewartii_. Sequence analysis of a 16S rDNA region showed that our JM-5Â´ bacterial isolate was 99 per cent identical to _P. stewartii_ subsp. _stewartii_.

Pathogenicity tests showed characteristic symptoms of fruit bronzing in jackfruits 14 days post inoculation with a bacterial suspension. No symptoms were observed in control fruits inoculated with sterile water. Bacteria re-isolated from inoculated jackfruits were identical to the original isolate.

Based on morphological, biochemical, physiological, pathogenicity and molecular analyses, we conclude that Mexican bacterial isolates from jackfruit can be identified as _P. stewartii_ subsp. _stewartii_. This is the first record of jackfruit bronzing disease in Mexico.

[The fruits of the jackfruit tree (_Artocarpus heterophyllus_) can weigh up to 60 kg with almost 1 m in length and are amongst the largest tree fruits known. Depending on the level of sweetness of different varieties, they are eaten as fresh or preserved fruit, or as vegetable. The crop is grown widely in tropical and subtropical areas.

Fruit bronzing is considered an emerging disease of jackfruit in southern Asia. _Pantoea stewartii_ subsp. _stewartii_. (Pss, previously _Erwinia stewartii_) has only recently been identified as the cause of this disease in the Philippines (see links below) and subsequently also in Malaysia (ProMED-mail post 20170905.5294905).

Pss is known as the cause of Stewart's bacterial wilt of maize (an important disease in parts of the USA and Europe) that is transmitted primarily by and overwinters in the corn flea beetle (_Chaetocnema pulicaria_). Hence, a similar association with an insect vector may be suspected for Pss bronzing of jackfruit, but further work is needed on the epidemiology of this disease. The report above is the first record of jackfruit bronzing from the Americas and generally from outside of Asia.

Pss also causes a leaf blight of rice and is considered an emerging pathogen of that crop (as is _P. ananatis_, ProMED-mail post 20170504.5012251).

The genus _Pantoea_ belongs to the family of _Enterobacteriaceae_, which also comprises genera pathogenic to animals or humans. However, the majority of its members are plant-associated. Species in the genus can cause diseases on a number of crops, such as leaf blights of cereals (_P. agglomerans_), pink disease of pineapple (_P. citrea_), brown stalk rot of maize (_P. ananatis_ and a novel _Pantoea_ species), center rot of onion (_P. ananatis_). The effects of different bacterial strains on hosts can vary dramatically. The bacteria are generally transmitted by insect vectors, plant material, and infected seed, making them a quarantine risk.
