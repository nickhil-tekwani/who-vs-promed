The Bukit Jugra RMAF [Royal Malaysian Air Force] base is under
lockdown after 24 trainee commandos were admitted for suspected
leptospirosis infection. Health Ministry officials have descended on
the army base since Monday [28 Nov 2011] to ensure there is no
outbreak. The trainees have been quarantined in the maternity ward of
the Banting Hospital. Two of them are in critical condition, with one
trainee transferred to the Kuala Lumpur Hospital yesterday. The
condition of the remaining 22 trainees was reported to be stable. They
will be released only after tests are complete — expected to be in a
few days.

According to sources, the patients were brought there on Monday
evening [28 Nov 2011]for [suspected] food poisoning. A security guard
said family members and friends of the trainees, who turned up at the
hospital earlier in the day, were not allowed to enter the ward. "They
just sat here and waited for hours. All they wanted was to see the
trainees, but no one was allowed to go in. They left after talking to
doctors on duty," he said. The guards said they were given strict
orders by the hospital management not to allow anyone to enter. A
hospital staff person who contacted The Malay Mail said they were
given strict orders by hospital management and military commandants to
keep the situation under wraps. Hospital Banting director Dr Rozita
Mohamed confirmed the commandos were admitted there but declined to
comment further.

Visiting the hospital yesterday, The Malay Mail found the 22 commandos
housed at the maternity ward. A hospital staffer said there were 2
maternity wards and whenever a large number of patients were admitted
with the same problem, they were kept at one of the wards, also known
as "Ward 2".

A nurse, who declined to be identified, said as patients were
quarantined, they had to be housed in a separate ward. "The hospital
is taking precautionary measures as the disease may be contagious."
Defense Minister Datuk Seri Zahid Hamidi yesterday confirmed the
soldiers were infected by leptospirosis, which is commonly associated
with rat’s urine. Sources said it was believed the commandos could
have been infected from the food or water they consumed.

Health Ministry officers are conducting checks at the RMAF base,
including scouring the Bukit Jugra jungle area where the victims are
believed to have undergone final training. The health officers are
also inspecting the airbase’s water tanks and water outlets to see
if the food or water source could have been contaminated.

Leptospirosis is a rare disease, which infects humans exposed to
bacterially contaminated animal urine and is contagious as long as the
bacteria remain moist. The main carriers are rats, moles and mice but
a large range of other mammals, such as dogs, deer, rabbits,
hedgehogs, cows, sheep, raccoons, opossums, skunks and certain marine
mammals, are able to carry and transmit the disease as secondary
hosts. [Also pios. - Mod.JW].

The disease can infect humans through contact with water, food, or
soil containing urine from these infected animals. This may happen by
swallowing contaminated food or water, or through skin contact if
there are cuts on the skin -- it is not known to spread from human
contact. Studies have also shown there is a direct correlation between
the amount of rainfall and incidence of leptospirosis, making it
seasonal in temperate climates and year-round in tropical climates.

Occupations at risk of being infected by leptospirosis include
veterinarians, slaughterhouse workers, farmers, sewer workers and
people working on derelict buildings. Rowers are also known to
contract the disease. The Health Ministry’s website states symptoms
of leptospirosis include an average incubation period of 10 days and
the disease starts with fever, shivering, body aches and headache.
Victims might also suffer from muscle aches, enlarged liver or spleen,
swollen sweat glands, sore threat, rashes, lung problems and stiff
muscles. Most leptospirosis cases are treatable although there are
cases of deaths when complications arise. Supportive treatment is
needed for complicated cases and it is advisable to avoid stagnant
water or pools as these are areas where the bacteria [have their]
habitats.

This year witnessed at least 5 reports of leptospirosis scares or
outbreaks nationwide, from Penang to Kuala Krai and all the way to
Sarawak. The biggest [outbreak] was reported by the Sarawak Health
Department on Nov 8 with 96 confirmed cases in Bintulu over a period
of 21 months. It, however, has been pointed out that the State’s
overall incidence is 1.9 individuals per 100 000 population, far below
the threshold for any disease to be considered an outbreak. Another
reported incident occurred on Oct 17 when 11 infected _orang asli_
[indigenous Malay] school children from SK Sungai Berua were
hospitalised at the Sultanah Nur Zahirah Hospital and Hulu Terengganu
Hospital in Terengganu.

Defense Minister Datuk Seri Zahid Hamidi said: "The authorities
conducted [rodent] extermination exercises at the camp, including the
living quarters of those hospitalised," he told The Malay Mail. Asked
whether the camp would be quarantined, Zahid said they were waiting
for a report from the Health Corps director-general before proceeding
further. He said the family members of those affected had been
notified.

[Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that is distributed
widely throughout the world in warm climates and is transmitted to
humans by direct contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes with the
urine of infected animals or by contact with wet soil, vegetation, or
water that has been contaminated with infected animal urine. These
animals are mostly asymptomatic, but chronically infected with one of
the several hundred serovars of the spirochete _Leptospira
interrogans_. Many species of wild and domestic animals (including
rodents, dogs, cattle, and swine) are susceptible to chronic urinary
infection with _L. interrogans_. In carrier animals with chronic renal
infections, leptospiruria persists for long periods or for life.
_Leptospira_ bacteria shed in urine may survive in water or moist soil
for weeks to months.

Outbreaks frequently follow heavy rainfalls, flooding with fresh
water, and increasing rodent numbers. Leptospirosis is an occupational
hazard for people who work outdoors or with animals, for example,
farmers, sewer workers, veterinarians, dairy farmers, rice and
sugarcane field workers and military personnel. It is a recreational
hazard for those who participate in outdoor water sports such as
swimming, rowing, or whitewater rafting in contaminated lakes and
rivers.

Because infected humans can also pass _Leptospira_ in their urine for
months, person-to-person transmission of leptospirosis would seem to
be possible, but rarely occurs; It is thought that the low pH of human
urine limits survival of leptospires after excretion
(http://cmr.asm.org/content/14/2/296.full). Transmission by sexual
intercourse during convalescence has been reported, as has
transmission in one case from an infected mother to her infant by
breast-feeding (http://cmr.asm.org/content/14/2/296.full).

To contain the spread of a contagious illness that is easily
transmitted person-to-person, public health authorities rely on
isolation and quarantine. Isolation refers to separation of those who
are already ill from those who are not and quarantine refers to
separation of persons who have been exposed to a specific illness, but
aren’t yet ill, from others. Because of the rarity of
person-to-person transmission of leptospirosis, there is usually no
isolation of infected persons or quarantine of well persons who have
been exposed to this disease
(http://www.maclearinghouse.com/PDFs/BID/SV4102.pdf).

Bandar Jugra is a town in the state of Selangor, one of the 13
Malaysian states. This state is located on the west coast of the
Malaysian Peninsula and completely surrounds the federal territory of
Kuala Lumpur (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selangor). A map of
