Health authorities in east China's Jiangxi Province on Saturday [25 Jan 2014] confirmed a 2nd human case of H10N8, a new strain of bird flu known to affect humans. The patient, a 55-year-old woman in Nanchang, capital of Jiangxi, is in a critical condition, the provincial health and family planning department said in a statement. The woman developed symptoms of a sore throat, dizziness, and loss of strength on 8 Jan 2014 and was admitted to hospital on 15 Jan 2014. She had been to an agricultural market, said the statement.

Those who had come into contact with her have not shown any abnormal symptoms. Health experts called on the public to stay away from live poultry and maintain good hygiene. On 17 Dec 2013, the local health authorities in Jiangxi confirmed that they had detected the H10N8 virus from a 73-year-old woman, who died of respiratory failure on 6 Dec 2013. At that time, health professionals said H10N8 existed among birds, but human infection had never been reported before.

For the 2nd time in a little over a month, and the 2nd time ever reported in a patient, the Jiangxi Provincial Health and Family Planning Commission reported the confirmation of a human case of avian influenza A (H10N8), according to a China News report from 25 Jan 2014 (computer translated).

According to the report, a 55-year-old woman presented with sore throat, dizziness, fatigue, and other symptoms on 8 Jan 2014. On 15 Jan 2014, she advanced to severe pneumonia and is currently hospitalized in critical condition. The epidemiological investigation of the case revealed that the patient has a history of shopping in bazaars. This is the 2nd confirmed human H10N8 avian flu case recorded. Late last year [2013], a 73-year-old woman, also from Jiangxi Province, became the 1st ever reported patient to contract avian influenza A (H10N8). The 1st patient, who had underlying medical conditions, was hospitalized on 30 Nov 2013 and died on 6 Dec 2014.

China has previously detected H10N8 in wild and domestic birds. In addition to China, the World Health Organization (WHO) says that, based on available literature, the virus has been detected in birds since 1965 in at least 6 countries (Italy, USA, Canada, South Korea, Sweden and Japan).

The WHO offers the following advice to protect yourself from avian influenza:
- Avoid contact with sick or dead poultry. Keep children away from poultry.
- Avoid touching any surfaces that may have been contaminated with poultry feces or blood.
- Do not eat raw or undercooked poultry. Cook poultry to internal temperature of 70 C (until meat is not pink in the centre), and do not touch cooked meat with raw meat.
- Clean cooking implements that have been in contact with raw meat before re-using.
- Wash hands regularly, especially after handling poultry, while cooking and before eating.
- Cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze.

WHO does not recommend any specific measures be applied to travellers at this time. Poultry, poultry products (eggs), and pork can be safely consumed provided they are properly cooked and properly handled during food preparation.

[The 1st human case of avian influenza (H10N8) virus infection was reported in late December 2013, also from Jiangxi province of mainland China. In that instance, the patient was an immuno-compromised elderly woman. Similar to other avian influenza virus infections of human patients encountered so far (with the exception of H5N1 virus), there was no apparent onward transmission of infection to other related or unrelated persons. Circumstantial evidence suggested that the infection was contracted by exposure to domestic fowl in a local "wet" market. The 1st H10N8 infected human patient died, and the 2nd patient is in hospital in critical condition. Both human cases have occurred in Jiangxi province. - Mod.CP
