The Ministry of Public Health has ordered the provincial public health
offices to monitor the spread of hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) after
over 10 000 patients have been infected so far this year [2010].
According to Deputy Public Health Minister Dr Phansiri Kullanartsiri,
a change from the rainy season to the winter has provided a climate
suitable for HFMD spread. 90 percent of the patients are infants aged
less than 5 due to their low immunity. Besides, no vaccine is
currently available to immunize them.

According to the recent statistics provided by the Epidemiology
Bureau, there have been 10 684 patients suffering from HFMD since
January 2010 with no fatalities have been reported. This figure is
one-fold more [2-fold?] than during the same period last year [2009].

HFMD usually spreads in places where groups of children play or study
together; therefore, one infected child can spread the disease to
others very easily. The disease can be transmitted via mucus, saliva,
wounds, and feces of infected patients. Key spots to monitor are
kindergartens, infant care centers, nurseries, swimming pools, as well
as indoor and air-conditioned playgrounds in department stores.
Entrepreneurs are hence requested to sanitize their premises on a
daily basis to help protect infants from the disease.

[Previously hand-foot-mouth disease was reported in Phuket province of
Thailand (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20100721.2451). According to the
Thai Ministry of Public Health, Bureau of Epidemiology's (BOE) report
on cases and deaths of diseases under surveillance by province,
Thailand, available at
<http://epid.moph.go.th/wesr/file/y53/F53373.pdf>, as of week 37
(12-18 Sep 2010), the cumulative number of HFMD cases in Thailand was
11 298 cases with one death in 2010, which was higher than the number
of cases during the same period in 2009 (6172 cases). The median of
cumulative number of cases between 2005 and 2009 was 4150 cases.
However, the number of HFMD cases during week 37 2010 (64 cases) was
less than that reported in the same period of 2009 (183 cases). The
median of cases during week 37 between 2005 and 2009 was 143 cases.

According to the report, infection seems to be mild; only one fatality
was reported among 11 298 cases of HFMD. It is likely, therefore, that
the infections were not caused by enterovirus 71, which in previous
outbreaks elsewhere has been associated with serious disease.
