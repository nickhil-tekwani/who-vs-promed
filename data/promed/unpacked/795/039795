More than a dozen swans from a flock popular with tourists in Shakespeare's home town have been killed by bird flu (avian influenza]. Government scientists are currently conducting tests on the birds which died following an outbreak of avian flu in Stratford-upon-Avon.

Tens of thousands of tourists visit the Warwickshire town and birthplace of playwright William Shakespeare each year to marvel at the scores of swans living on the River Avon. But in recent weeks, several of the swans - as well as ducks and geese - have been struck down with avian flu leaving wildlife experts fearing Stratford-upon-Avon's swan population could be wiped out.

An outbreak was first confirmed at a rescue centre in Wychbold, a 40-minute drive from Stratford-upon-Avon, but now the town's rescue group says their swan population is at risk after several birds also contracted the deadly disease. Cyril Bennis, who runs Stratford-Upon-Avon Swan Rescue group and is a former mayor of the town, warned the current outbreak -- one of 2 currently active in the UK -- was 'beyond control'. Mr Bennis, 72, who has been caring for swans in the Worcestershire town for 40 years, said: 'Three weeks ago one of the sanctuaries that we take our swans to was shut down because of suspected avian flu. The swans that were on the mend there had to be put to sleep. The other rescue centre also had to be shut down because 2 swans there also had suspected avian flu.'

Mr Bennis said that officials from the Department for the Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs (Defra) came and collected swans that had already died 2 weeks ago but that more animals were 'dying left, right and centre'. He added: 'I am having to pile them up in order to get some clarity on what I am supposed to do with them. 'At the moment, I have over a dozen dead birds -- not only swans but ducks and geese too. I have had to put 2 swans to sleep today, one last night, 7 others have died of suspected avian flu in the last few days -- it's a daily occurrence. I really fear that the entire population, which is more than 70 swans, could be seriously under threat. It is frustrating and heart-breaking to see any animal suffer in front of you. These animals are perfectly healthy one day and then dead the next. I watched one last night as died in my arms and I could not do anything about it.'

Avian flu, more commonly known as bird flu, is not an airborne virus but spreads bird-to-bird through direct contact or through contaminated body fluids and faeces, according to Defra. The virus can also be spread by contaminated feed and water or by dirty vehicles, clothing, and footwear. Cases can spike during the winter months if birds migrating from mainland Europe to the UK are carrying the disease. The virus can, in certain cases, also affect humans although Defra says the risk to the public is low.

Defra is currently running tests to determine the strain confirmed in Stratford. Bird flu has also been confirmed at a premises in Wrexham in Wales.

Meanwhile, the rescue centre where the disease was first confirmed has been closed while the outbreak is active. Wychbold Swan Rescue said it was 'devastated' by the outbreak and is currently the subject of a Defra control zone. The outbreak meant all birds at the site had to be culled while officers also put in place a 3 km [2 mi] and 10 km [6 mi] control zone measure around the premises.

In a statement, Wychbold Swan Rescue told its supporters: 'As you can imagine, we are devastated by recent events. We can't believe this has happened again. This means until further notice, we are unable to attend to any birds. It's an extremely unfortunate situation that everyone at Swan Rescue is thoroughly broken-hearted about.'

An outbreak late last year [2020] resulted in the death of around 25 swans in Stratford, as well as others in Worcester and Evesham.

[The HPAI epidemic of 2020-2021 is the largest that has occurred in Europe, with almost 4000 HPAI episodes reported in around 30 European countries. Wild birds appear to be playing an important role in the HPAI epidemic. Most wild birds reported infected have been Anseriformes (swans, ducks, geese), followed by birds of prey. Some wild migratory waterbirds contribute to the propagation of HPAI viruses. - Mod.PMB
