On 28 Oct 2009, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
notified the Virginia Department of Health (VDH) of suspected rabies
in a Virginia man aged 42 years. Earlier that day, an infectious
disease physician in Virginia had contacted CDC requesting
confirmatory diagnostic testing and reported initiating treatment with
the Milwaukee protocol (1) after consultation with staff at the
Medical College of Wisconsin. This report summarizes the patient's
exposure history, clinical course, and treatment, and describes
efforts to identify close contacts requiring post-exposure prophylaxis
(PEP).

According to family members, the patient had reported an encounter
with a dog while in India approximately 3 months before symptom onset.
On 29 Oct 2009, infection with a rabies virus was confirmed by direct
fluorescent antibody testing of a nuchal skin biopsy, and reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) typed the virus as a
variant associated with dogs in India. The patient died on 20 Nov 2009.

Public health authorities conducted rabies exposure assessments of 174
persons associated with the patient, and 32 persons (18 percent)
initiated rabies PEP. This is the 7th case of rabies reported in the
United States acquired abroad since 2000. This case highlights the
importance of raising public awareness of rabies, particularly the
risk for rabies exposures in association with travel to rabies-endemic
countries, and the importance of initiating PEP promptly after a
potential exposure.

Case Report
----------------
On 23 Oct 2009, a male physician aged 42 years in Virginia experienced
the onset of chills and "hot flashes." The next morning, he began
experiencing discomfort in his legs, and that evening, he developed
spontaneous ejaculation occurring up to once per hour, urinary
incontinence and back pain radiating to the left lower extremity. Two
days later, on 26 Oct 2009, he visited an Emergency Department (ED)
for assessment. The patient was awake, oriented, and afebrile during
this visit. Magnetic resonance imaging of his lumbar spine revealed
degenerative disease at L4-L5, and he was discharged with a diagnosis
of lumbar back pain, given pain medications, and instructed to follow
up with his primary-care physician. That evening, he began to gag
while drinking and showering.

On 27 Oct 2009, the patient contacted his primary-care physician and
raised concern about the possibility of rabies. He was referred back
to the same ED for evaluation of neurologic disorders, including rabies.

On 27 Oct 2009, the patient returned to the ED and, in addition to the
previously noted symptoms, exhibited anxiety and erratic behavior and
had involuntary dystonic movements of his upper extremities.

The patient reported travel to India approximately 3 months before
symptom onset but gave no clear history of animal exposure occurring
while in India or in the United States.

Physical examination showed tachycardia (134 beats per minute) and
elevated blood pressure (153/93 mm Hg) but no fever. The patient was
noted to have dystonic movements of the upper extremities and neck and
loud involuntary vocalizations. Sensation and motor strength were
normal. The patient demonstrated aversion to water when offered. A
computed tomography (CT) scan of the head showed only left maxillary
sinusitis. The patient was admitted to the hospital (hospital A) with
a differential diagnosis that included rabies and other neurologic
diagnoses of unknown etiology. Empiric antimicrobial and antiviral
therapy for meningioencephalitis was initiated.

Within 24 hours of admission, the patient was noted to be shouting,
gagging on copious salivary secretions, and unable to follow commands.
His tachycardia and hypertension worsened and, soon after, he was
transferred to the intensive-care unit, he developed seizures,
sustained a cardiac arrest, and required ventilator support. At this
time, the patient developed a low-grade fever (99.4 F [37.4 C]).
Complete blood count showed mild leukocytosis (15.42 x 109/L [normal:
5-10 x 109/L]), mild hyperglycemia (120 mg/dL [normal: 70-105 mg/dL),
and a creatine kinase of greater than 16 000 U/mL (normal: 12-70
U/mL). Urinalysis showed large blood and hyaline casts. Toxicology and
heavy metal screenings were unremarkable.

On 28 Oct 2009, the 2nd hospital day, a lumbar puncture showed an
elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose of 101 mg/dL (normal: 50-80
mg/dL), normal protein of 31 mg/dL (normal: 15-45 mg/dL), and 6 white
blood cells/mm3 (normal: 0-3 cells/mm3). The treating physician
initiated the Milwaukee protocol, including ketamine infusion, but in
keeping with this protocol, the patient was not given rabies immune
globulin, vaccine, or antivirals (1). Serum, CSF, nuchal skin biopsy,
and saliva were collected and submitted to CDC for rabies testing. The
next day, 29 Oct 2009, CDC detected rabies virus antigen in the skin
biopsy by direct fluorescent antibody testing. Rabies viral RNA
amplified by RT-PCR was typed as a variant common to dogs in India.

Serial assessments of serum, CSF, and saliva were conducted to monitor
for viral clearance. A ventriculostomy drain was placed for continuous
monitoring and management of intracranial fluid pressures. With
turning and suctioning, the patient experienced asystole. Increasing
episodes of asystole resulted in placement of a transvenous pacemaker
by hospital day 8. By hospital day 12, the patient developed
inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion followed by severe
central diabetes insipidus treated with desmopressin and continuous
vasopressin infusion. By hospital day 15, the patient developed late
and marginal antibody response in saliva but never developed
neutralizing antibody in CSF, which is necessary for viral clearance
and cure. Sedation was tapered over one week with clinical evidence of
denervation indicated by loss of brain stem reflexes and diminished
autonomic dysfunction. The patient died on 20 Nov 2009 (hospital day
25).

Public Health Investigation
-----------------------------
VDH and the Fairfax County Health Department (FCHD) were notified of a
suspected rabies case on 28 Oct 2009, the patient's 2nd hospital day.
FCHD began working with hospital A's epidemiology and occupational
health staff to generate a list of potentially exposed hospital
employees. In addition, FCHD initiated interviews with family and
friends to clarify the patient's exposure history and gather
information about persons who had contact with the patient since 8 Oct
2009, the date after which he was considered potentially infectious.
According to the patient's father, the patient had an unwitnessed
encounter with a dog while he was in India. Family members were
unaware of other possible exposures to rabies and did not know if the
patient sought medical care or rabies PEP.

The patient was a psychiatrist and worked primarily at a hospital
(hospital B), where he supervised psychiatry residents and did not
have direct patient contact. He also worked one day a week at 2
additional health-care facilities (facilities A and B). Hospital B is
located in the District of Columbia, and the 2 facilities are located
in Maryland. On 29 Oct 2009, VDH contacted the Maryland Department of
Health and Mental Hygiene (MDHMH) and the District of Columbia
Department of Health (DCDOH) to facilitate assessment of coworkers and
patients for PEP according to Advisory Committee on Immunization
Practices (ACIP) criteria (2). A survey tool was created to assess
health-care contacts, and another questionnaire was developed to
assess household contacts and coworkers. A total of 32 (18 percent) of
174 persons evaluated for potential exposure initiated PEP. No adverse
reactions to PEP or additional cases of rabies were reported to public
health authorities.

FCHD interviewed all 70 health-care providers who had administered
care to the patient in hospital A, and 17 met the criteria for a
nonbite exposure to rabies (because of exposure to the patient's
saliva). An additional 7 assessed persons initiated rabies PEP despite
no indication; 2 had already initiated PEP before the exposure
assessment by FCHD. Among the 34 coworkers assessed at hospital B by
DCDOH, only one, who identified himself as a close friend of the
patient, met the criteria for nonbite exposure and received rabies
PEP. MDHMH assessed 37 coworkers and 26 patients associated with
facilities A and B. No coworkers or patients at either facility met
the criteria for exposure, and none pursued rabies PEP. All 6 family
members and one assessed friend were identified who might have been
exposed to saliva from the patient, and all received rabies PEP.

MMWR Editorial Note
------------------------
The case described in this report underscores 2 important aspects of
human rabies prevention: 1) the importance of awareness about rabies
risks when traveling abroad and 2) the need to seek prompt medical
evaluation after an animal exposure (3). Since 2000, 7 of the 31 human
rabies cases reported in the United States were acquired from exposure
abroad; 2 were acquired in the Philippines (California, 2001 and
2006), and one each were acquired in Ghana (New York, 2000), El
Salvador (California, 2004), Haiti (Florida, 2004), Mexico
(California, 2008), and India (the 2009 case described in this report)
(4). An attempt to treat the patient after the onset of clinical
symptoms of rabies using an experimental treatment (the Milwaukee
protocol) failed. Prompt administration of rabies PEP after an
exposure remains the only documented method for preventing death after
an exposure to rabies (2).

Although human-to-human rabies transmission in a health-care setting
is theoretically possible, no such occurrence has been documented.
Rabies exposure risks for health-care personnel who care for rabies
patients include exposure of mucous membranes or open wounds to
infectious body fluids or tissue (e.g., saliva, tears, or neurologic
tissue). Adherence to standard infection control precautions minimizes
the risk for health-care personnel. However, additional precautions,
such as wearing face shields when performing higher-risk procedures
that can produce droplets or aerosols of saliva (i.e., suction of oral
secretions), might be warranted (2).

Among the health-care personnel assessed for potential contact in
recent human rabies cases in the United States, the proportion that
received PEP ranged from 2.5 percent to 30.0 percent (5-8). In this
report, 34 percent of health-care personnel received PEP after a
potential contact with the patient. However, 7 health-care personnel
received PEP despite PEP not being recommended after risk assessment.
Prompt communication with public health authorities and education of
personnel who have contact with a rabies patient are critical to
appropriate risk assessment and reducing unnecessary PEP (2,9).

Dogs represent the most frequent risk for bite exposures to travelers
and should be avoided. Travelers to rabies-endemic countries should be
warned about the risk for acquiring rabies and educated about animal
bite prevention and appropriate actions to take if an exposure does
occur (i.e., wound washing and medical attention to determine if PEP
is necessary). Relative rabies risk and recommendations for travelers
by region and country can be found in CDC's Health Information for
International Travel 2010 (10).

[The Milwaukee protocol is an experimental course of treatment of an
acute infection of rabies in a human being. The treatment involves
putting the patient into a chemically induced coma and administering
antiviral drugs. It was developed following the successful treatment
of a teenager from Wisconsin, becoming the 1st of only 3 patients
known to have survived symptomatic rabies without receiving rabies
vaccine. A detailed description of the Milwaukee protocol for
treatment of rabies patients can be accessed at:
<http://www.chw.org/display/PPF/DocID/33223/router.asp>. The Milwaukee
protocol is a treatment of last resort which should only be attempted
after a diagnosis of rabies virus infection has been confirmed.

The case described in this MMWR report emphasizes the importance of
awareness of rabies infection risks when traveling abroad and the need
to seek prompt medical evaluation after an animal exposure. It should
be perhaps required reading for persons intending to travel in
rabies-endemic regions. - Mod.CP]
