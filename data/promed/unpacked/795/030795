Taiwan's Department of Health announced yesterday the second indigenous
case of cholera in this year. The patient was a 73-year-old man living in
Taichung. He became ill after a dinner of "hot steamboat" with 17 relatives
on 27 June. The following night, the patient appeared comatose and
semi-paralytic, and had profuse watery diarrhoea. He was admitted to
hospital with a diagnosis of stroke and was put in an intensive care unit.
On 7 July, _Vibrio cholerae_ was cultured from the patient and on 8 July it
was identified as toxigenic O139 strain. The condition of the patient was
stable after treatment. The health department has taken specimens from the
restaurant and contacts for investigation. None of the 17 relatives who had
dinner with the patient developed watery diarrhoea.
