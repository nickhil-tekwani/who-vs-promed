[According to OIE's Aquatic Manual, "spring viremia of carp (SVC) is a rhabdovirus infection capable of inducing an acute haemorrhagic and contagious viremia in several carp species and of some other cyprinid and ictalurid fish species.

The virus appears to enter the host via the gill. A viraemia follows and the virus rapidly spreads to the liver, kidney, spleen, and alimentary tract. The virus can be detected in faeces and is also shed into the water via faeces and urine.

For a long time, the geographical range of SVC was limited to countries of the European continent that experience low water temperatures during winter. Consequently, the disease has been recorded from most European countries and from certain of the western Independent States of the former Soviet Union (Belarus, Georgia, Lithuania, Moldova, Russia, and the Ukraine). However, in 1998, the disease was recorded in goldfish in a lake in Brazil, in 2002 it was reported for the 1st time in 2 separate sites in the USA, and it was reported from Canada in 2006. Detection of the virus in carp in China (Peoples Rep. of) was confirmed in 2004. Confirmation of the isolation of SVCV from rainbow trout and Indian carp in Iran, and from Nile tilapia in Egypt awaits more data, and so the addition of those countries to the geographical range of the virus, also awaits those data."

For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to OIE Aquatic Manual, chapter 2.3.9 Spring Viremia of Carp at http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=2439&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_svc.htm

There is no indication that SVC is a threat to human health http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/spring_viremia_of_carp.pdf. - Mod.CRD
