Some 60 horses in the department of Linguere (Center) have died of a
mysterious and yet unidentified disease, although local animal health
professionals think it might be equine plague [African horse sickness].

The deaths have occurred over the course of a few days in certain
localities of the department, and in particular in Kadji, Khoi-Khoi,
Bari, and Thilla, where several horses died suddenly.

While the results of tests on the dead animals sent to a laboratory
in Dakar are received, speculation over the nature of this mysterious
disease continues. Without making any formal statements, the
department's breeding technicians believe that the symptoms presented
by the horses are compatible with African horse sickness. In any
event, the department's health professionals are proceeding with the
vaccination of animals to prevent the spread of the disease to
unaffected areas.

In addition, preventive and protective measures should be implemented
in order to curb the development of infection and save the equine
population of the department. The public has expressed concern and
their wish for the disease to be stopped.
