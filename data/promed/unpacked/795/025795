_Wheat mosaic virus_ confirmed, appears to have spread
------------------------------------------------------
The focus of a field trip was soil-borne _Wheat mosaic virus_.
Although the yellow patches had been seen in isolated fields for
several years, the virus was only recently identified as the cause.
This year [2008] outbreaks appear to have spread. The discovery was
announced by Matt Weber and Marshal McKinley, agronomists with the
McGregor Company.

Among the group were Tim Murray, Washington State University, and
Richard Smiley, Oregon State University. "This is an unusual disease,
transmitted by a soil-borne fungus," Murray said. While not new, the
virus has been rarely identified in the Pacific Northwest. Murray
said the main control used elsewhere is disease-resistant varieties
of wheat. A priority will be identifying which [wheat] strains are
most resistant. There are very few other ways to control the disease,
Smiley said. Sanitizing equipment by cleaning off soil is one method,
he said.

Murray and Smiley said the virus is easy to confuse with another
disease, _Wheat streak mosaic virus_. "There's probably about 30
viruses that affect wheat, but it takes a biochemical analysis to
differentiate them," Smiley said. The cool, relatively damp
conditions this spring [2008] appear to have triggered more
outbreaks. Warmer weather, generally above 70 deg F [21 deg C], slows
and eventually stops the disease development, confining symptoms to
lower leaves.

Murray and Smiley also said it is possible the infection has been in
Walla Walla County for some time, but that the right conditions
hadn't occurred until recently to bring the virus out. "It's going to
vary from year to year," Murray said. "We're in a year now where
we're seeing a good expression of the disease."

Grain virus finding home in valley's grass seed crops
-----------------------------------------------------
As wheat acres soar in the Willamette Valley, so do concerns over a
virus associated with wheat that is infecting grass seed plants.
Researchers hope to develop a strategy to deal with _Barley yellow
dwarf virus_ [BYDV] in perennial ryegrass and tall fescue seed crops.
Western Oregon scientists attribute at least part of the influx to a
dramatic increase of wheat acres in the valley. BYDV causes a common
disease in wheat and is a constant concern in areas where wheat is
widely grown. Corn also is a host for the virus, but corn is
symptomless. The virus is spread by aphids.

OSU [Oregon State University] Extension agent Tom Silberstein said
this week he's been seeing extensive evidence of the virus in grass
seed in recent days. "We're seeing a lot of fields with yellow
patches and unthrifty plants," Silberstein said. He estimates that at
high levels the virus, which shrivels plant heads, can reduce yields
as much as 20 percent. Crop scientists are hoping to answer several
questions, such as whether certain varieties are more susceptible;
why the virus is showing up more often in 2nd-year fields; whether
infection occurs in the fall previous to the following year's crop or
in the previous spring and summer; and what are effective control
strategies.

In wheat, researchers advise growers to delay planting to give cold
fall weather a chance to reduce aphid populations. In grass seed,
however, where fields often stay in production between 3 and 5 years,
planting-date control strategies often are ineffective. Adding to
concerns in grass seed is that once a plant is infected, it is
infected for life. That gives aphids plenty of opportunity to feed on
the plant and transmit the disease to another plant.

Chemical control strategies available to growers include lowering
aphid populations in a field or deterring them from entering a field,
Silberstein said. But chemical control strategies often are
ineffective.

[3] Triticum mosaic virus, wheat - Kansas

Virus adds new wrinkle to wheat disease picture
------------------------------------------------
First found by Kansas State University researchers in 2006, a newly
discovered virus affecting wheat was officially recognized and named
Triticum mosaic virus [TriMV] in 2007. TriMV is now considered one of
3 diseases affecting wheat in approximately the same manner -- the
other 2 being _Wheat streak mosaic virus_ [WSMV] and high plains
disease [HPD, probable virus], says Erick DeWolf, K-State Research
and Extension plant pathologist. All of these diseases are vectored,
with varying degrees of efficiency, by the wheat curl mite. In
addition, the disease symptoms of all 3 diseases are virtually
identical, he adds.

Many aspects of TriMV remain largely unknown at this point, including
varietal reaction, distribution, and yield loss potential. "Although
there has been no conclusive varietal screening for TriMV alone yet,
it is known that RonL is susceptible," DeWolf says. RonL is the 1st
variety to have true genetic resistance to WSMV, at least under cool
temperature conditions. If RonL shows WSMV-like symptoms, and
temperatures have been cool, then TriMV should be suspected.

At this point, there is no reason for producers to be unduly alarmed
by the detection of this new virus disease on wheat, DeWolf says.
"TriMV may have been present at low levels for many years, and was
only now detected when disease symptoms appeared on RonL," he says.
"It is also possible that TriMV is new to the High Plains, but there
is no way to know for sure." Because TriMV is vectored in the same
manner as WSMV and HPD, producers should take the same preventive
measures: control volunteer wheat and plant after the Hessian
fly-free date, DeWolf says.

[Soil-borne wheat mosaic disease
--------------------------------
Wheat mosaic disease was first reported in 1919 in the central United
States, and _Wheat mosaic virus_ (WMV, genus _Furovirus_) was later
identified as the cause making it one of the earliest known wheat
viruses and the 1st to be characterized as soil-borne. The disease
now occurs in many countries from various parts of the world.
Normally only autumn-sown (winter) wheat develops symptoms, although
spring wheat is also susceptible. Symptoms range from mild green to
prominent yellow leaf mosaics (mottling). Stunting can be moderate to
severe. Rising spring temperatures slow and eventually stop disease
development.

WMV is transmitted by the soil-inhabiting fungus _Polymyxa graminis_
and can also be spread with contaminated soil, by water, and
mechanical means. It is not seed-transmitted. For reasons not
understood, the virus sometimes spreads more rapidly and over longer
distances than can be explained by soil or water movement. Resistant
wheat cultivars are available, and so far no resistance-breaking WMV
strains have been reported.

Barley yellow dwarf disease
---------------------------
Barley yellow dwarf (BYD) occurs worldwide and is the most
destructive of virus diseases of wheat. Grain yields may be reduced
by one third. It attacks a wide range of grass species (_Gramineae_)
including wheat, oats, rice, maize, rye, and barley. Oats are usually
considered more susceptible than wheat. Symptoms include leaf
discolouration from yellow to purple (depending on the host species),
stunting, reduced tillering, and empty seed heads. Plants infected in
autumn may not survive the winter or show severe symptoms when growth
resumes. Diseased plants often occur in circular patches within the
field, which are associated with colonisation by the aphid vectors.

BYD viruses have now been split into several species in the family
_Luteoviridae_ (mostly in the genus _Luteovirus_) and are
differentiated by their ability to be transmitted by various aphid
species and their virulence on a selected variety of oats. They
cannot be transmitted by seed, pollen, or mechanical means and cannot
survive in stubble or in the soil. Volunteer cereal plants or grassy
weeds may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Disease management includes
use of resistant cultivars and control of the aphid vectors.

Triticum mosaic virus
---------------------
Triticum mosaic virus (TriMV) is an as yet unclassified virus in the
family _Potyviridae_. It was discovered very recently (2006) in the
Kansas Hays area in wheat cultivars developed for their resistance to
_Wheat streak mosaic virus_ (WSMV). It is spread by the wheat curl
mite _Aceria tulipae_. For more information on this mite and _Wheat
streak mosaic virus_ see ProMED-mail post no. 20070928.3211.
