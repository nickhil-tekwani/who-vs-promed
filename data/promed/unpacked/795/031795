Up to now, the number of people infected with tularemia after a hunt in
Griesheim (Hessen, Germany) has increased to at least 6. Laboratory results
are pending for another hunter.
"We probably have one death" said Mrs. Doris Becker, spokeswoman of the
administration. No laboratory results are available as the deceased had
been already buried before tularemia was taken into account. In the press
release is noted that he "died with typical symptoms".
20 men had participated at the hunt. All cases, the probable case, and the
deceased were part of a group of 8 persons that gutted the hares. Their age
was between 46 and 73 years. All but the one were treated immediately and
are well now. All were suffering with "flu-like symptoms" high fever,
malaise, muscle and joint pains, and swollen lymph nodes.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Gekeler for the follow-up report. The death may indeed
be secondary to _F. tularensis_ infection, but no specifics are given. The
morbidity and mortality of tularemia is, in part, due to the type of the
organism involved. Type A, _F. tularensis_ biovar tularensis, is much more
virulent than type B, biovar _palaeartica_. The latter type is generally
the one found in Europe and Asia, whereas type A is the most common type in
North America (1). Some tularensis strains, however, are found in Europe
(2). In the pre-antimicrobial era, the mortality from type A infections
was between 5-15 percent of cases but as high as 30-60 percent for
untreated pneumonic and typhoidal forms (1).
