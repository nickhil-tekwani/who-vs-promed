A chicken in Merced County has tested positive for St Louis encephalitis virus for the 1st time in decades, the mosquito abatement district reported.

St Louis encephalitis can cause people to have mild flu-like symptoms. In more serious cases, symptoms could include seizures, paralysis, a coma and could even result in death. The virus has no specific treatment.

"The sentinel chicken sampled that tested positive for (the virus) is the 1st detection of the virus in Merced County in over 40 years," said Rhiannon Jones, general manager of the Merced County Mosquito Abatement District. "We were surprised we didn't find it in a mosquito first. It does send up some red flags for us. We're going to increase our surveillance and testing."

The chicken was found outside of Gustine last month [July 2017], and the mosquito abatement district received confirmation yesterday [16 Aug 2017] that the bird tested positive for the virus.

To date, 30 mosquito samples in 8 California counties have tested positive for the virus this year [2017]. The only chicken to test positive so far was the one found in Merced County. Last year [2016], there were 3 human cases of St Louis encephalitis in California. Those were the 1st human cases in 20 years.

Older adults and people with a weakened immune system are more likely to develop severe symptoms of encephalitis.

St Louis encephalitis and West Nile fever viruses are carried by the same _Culex_ mosquitoes and are controlled by the same surveillance and abatement methods, said David Heft, general manager of Turlock Mosquito Abatement District.

St Louis encephalitis was a virus historically controlled by mosquito abatement districts in California before West Nile virus came on the scene about 15 years ago. St Louis seemed to disappear after West Nile became the dominant virus, but it has reappeared in some counties in the last 2 or 3 years, Heft said.

Heft said the flooding earlier this year [2017] resulted in large numbers of _Culex_ mosquitoes, which may carry St Louis [encephalitis] and West Nile [fever], and "that is helping to drive (the St. Louis) virus." Mosquitoes spread the 2 viruses by biting an infected bird and then biting a person.

Officials anticipate encephalitis and West Nile virus detections will increase in the coming months. Residents should make sure to drain standing water, use repellents with DEET, picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus, avoid being outdoors during dawn and dusk, and report neglected swimming pools.

[2] Placer county: mosquito sample

The Placer Mosquito and Vector Control District reported today [17 Aug 2017] that a mosquito sample has tested positive for St Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV). Laboratory staff detected the virus while performing routine testing of mosquito samples. The sample was collected from a site along Gladding Road on the northern end of western Placer County, in an area surrounded by pasturelands. This is the 1st detection of St Louis encephalitis in mosquitoes in Placer County, and it comes on the heels of a detection in Yuba County earlier this week [week of 14 Aug 2017]. While SLEV has been found historically in many regions of California, there have been no human cases of SLEV since 1970 in Placer County, and only 4 cases between 1945 and 1969. The reemergence of the virus in this area is a new phenomenon, and public health and vector control officials will be closely monitoring surveillance information.

SLEV is transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected mosquito. In northern California, the mosquito species that carry SLEV, _Culex pipiens_, and _Culex tarsalis_, are the same mosquitoes that are able to transmit West Nile virus (WNV). [Infection with these] viruses also share the same symptoms. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), most people infected will not become ill. Initial symptoms of those who become ill include fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, and tiredness from 5-15 days after being infected. Severe neuroinvasive disease (often involving encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain) occurs more commonly in older adults. In rare cases, long-term disability or death can result.

Fortunately, another similarity between the viruses is the work done to prevent their spread. "We would not have to change our strategy or employ new tools to control the St Louis encephalitis virus" says Joel Buettner, District General Manager. "What we do for West Nile virus -- from the surveillance methods and tools to the treatments we conduct -- will help control St Louis encephalitis virus as well."

Due to this latest development, the District is planning to set additional traps and conduct intensive larval surveillance in the area. The Placer Mosquito and Vector Control District advises the public to implement the 3 Ds of protection:
- Drain or dump any standing water that may produce mosquitoes.
- Defend yourself and your home by using a CDC-recommended insect repellent and dressing protectively when outside, and making sure screens on doors and windows are in good condition.
- Contact the District for any additional help controlling mosquitoes around your home.

[St Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus appears sporadically in California, and has been reported in 4 locations in the state this year (2017). Earlier this month (August 2017) the virus was found in mosquitoes in 2 other counties in California -- Yuba and Stanislaus counties. Fortunately, no human cases have been reported there so far this summer.

SLE virus is endemic in the south western USA and sporadic cases in humans occur there infrequently. In 2015, human cases occurred in the adjoining states of Nevada and Arizona and positive mosquitoes were found in California. SLE virus was found in mosquitoes in Nevada in 2005.

Wild birds are the reservoir host and mosquitoes in the genus _Culex_ are vectors that transmit SLE virus. The mosquito species in which SLEV was detected are not mentioned in the reports above. Avoidance of mosquito bites and elimination of mosquito breeding sites in this area is good advice that should be heeded by the local residents.
