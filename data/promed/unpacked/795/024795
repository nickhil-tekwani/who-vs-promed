Methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA) Infections In Canine
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recently we have isolated MRSA from 2 dogs in Ontario, Canada. One isolate
was from an infected eye and was only susceptible to gentamicin,
tetracycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The other isolate was from
an infected ear and was susceptible to tetracycline. Both isolates were
susceptible to vancomycin.
Methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ is an organism acquiring
multiple resistance not only to beta-lactam antibiotics but also to a wide
variety of antimicrobials. In the worst case scenario the only effective
antimicrobial is vancomycin [In fact, strains of _S. aureus_ have been
isolated from humans that are not susceptible to vancomycin. - Man. Ed. DS].
The organism is usually isolated from hospitalized patients [Recently
community-acquired MRSA has become an increasing problem. - DS] and spread
nosocomially either by health care providers or by the use of common
equipment between patients. This organism does not impose a greater risk
than a methicillin-susceptible strain except for the limitation of
treatment choices which requires constant monitoring (vancomycin can cause
renal toxicity) and prohibitive cost.
In hospitals, patients colonized or infected with MRSA are placed under
strict [usually contact] isolation and various measures for limiting the
spread of the organism are instituted.
To my knowledge, the incidence of MRSA in animals has never been documented
in Canada or anywhere else.
Barrier precautions must be practiced by all health care providers.
Assuming that all patients are potentially infectious, in order to limit
the spread of such organisms to the health care providers or to other
animals. Once such an organism establishes itself in the facility it
becomes increasingly difficult to get rid of.
Therefore, the following are recommendations, which will reduce the risk of
spreading such isolates in the facility:
- Hand washing between patients whether gloves are used or not.
- Gloving, gowning and wearing mask if in contact with any body substance
(blood, fluids, urine etc.).
- Disinfecting or sterilizing shared equipment which are used on multiple
animals such as thermometers, etc.
- Cleaning and disinfection all surfaces where the animal contacted.
- If the infected animal is hospitalized, make sure it is isolated from
other animals in order to decrease the risk of spreading the infection
to other animals.
- Owners must be instructed on appropriate infection control procedures
especially hand washing after handling the animal.

[I suspect there are a number of bacteria with drug resistance. However,
appropriate client education is extremely necessary and often overlooked,
especially with a zoonotic infection. - Mod.TG]
[Clinical laboratories should be aware that dogs commonly are more commonly
colonized with _Staphylococcus intermedius_ than with _S. aureus_. _S.
intermedius_ is an organism that is not easily distinguished from _S.
aureus_, as both are coagulase-positive but it tends to be less resistant
to antibiotics than is _S. aureus_. It is rarely reported to cause
infections in humans, usually as a result of dog bites. I would be
interested to know if the identification of _S. aureus_ conclusively ruled
out _S. intermedius_. - Man. Ed. DS]
