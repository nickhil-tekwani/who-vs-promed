2008: On 6 Feb 2008, a suspected outbreak of avian influenza occurred
in Sema Village of Naiqiong Township in Duilongdeqing County of
Lhasa, Tibet. On 17 Feb 2008, the National Avian Influenza Reference
Laboratory confirmed highly pathogenic H5N1 subtype avian influenza.

A total of 132 poultry died in this outbreak, and 7698 poultry were culled.

The outbreak has been brought under control. After the outbreak

China has reported a bird flu outbreak in poultry in Tibet, the 2nd
in the Himalayan region in 2 weeks.

The outbreak, which started on 6 Feb 2008 in a village outside the
regional capital Lhasa, has killed 132 poultry and led to the culling
of 7698 birds, the Agriculture Ministry said.

The National Avian Influenza Reference Laboratory confirmed on Sunday
[17 Feb 2008] that the virus the birds contracted was a subtype of
the H5N1 strain, the ministry said in a statement posted on its
website <http://www.agri.gov.cn>
late on Monday [18 Feb 2008]. Authorities have taken emergency
measures to bring the epidemic under "effective control," it said.

An outbreak of the H5N1 strain in Tibet's Gongga county on 25 Jan
2008 [see 20080129.0373] killed 1000 chickens and ducks. More than 13
000 birds were culled at the time.

Separately, the Health Ministry said on Monday [18 Feb 2008] that a
22-year-old man in the central province of Hunan had died of the H5N1
strain of bird flu on 24 Jan 2008, bringing the number of human cases
in the country to 28, including 18 deaths.

China has reported 3 outbreaks of the disease in poultry since
December [2007], when average temperatures across the country hit
their lowest in 21 years.

Officials have not linked the flare-up to the unusually cold winter
weather and snow storms in large areas of the country. The bird flu
virus tends to be more active in low temperatures.

With the world's largest poultry population and hundreds of millions
of farmers raising birds in their backyards, China is seen as crucial
in the global fight against bird flu.

of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Hilary Benn) -
update on Avian Influenza [edited]
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/ministers/statements/hb080219b.htm>


I wish to report to the House on the recent cases of avian influenza in Dorset.

Following confirmation on 10 Jan 2008 that the H5N1 strain of avian
influenza had been isolated in 3 dead wild mute swans in the Chesil
Beach area in Dorset, a Wild Bird Control Area and a Monitoring Area
were established. The Control Area was larger than the minimum
required under European rules and reflected expert ornithological
advice about the movement of mute swans and other wild birds in the area.

Movement restrictions were introduced, including a requirement on
bird keepers to house their birds or otherwise isolate them from
contact with wild birds and a ban on bird gatherings. Ten dead mute
swans submitted under the surveillance programme have been confirmed
with the H5N1 virus, and the last positive sample was collected on 29
Jan 2008 and confirmed on 4 Feb 2008. In addition, we sampled 60
apparently healthy mute swans and faecal samples from other wild
birds but with negative results.

Taking into account epidemiological evidence, a veterinary risk
assessment and, as provided for under European rules, that it is now
21 days since the collection of the last positive case, I have today
[19 Feb 2008] confirmed the lifting of the control area.

I have also reassessed the shape and size of the Monitoring Area and
have decided that this should not be changed at the moment. On the
basis of advice from veterinary and ornithological experts, I have
concluded that the possibility of continuing undetected infection in
wild birds other than swans cannot be ruled out and that retention of
this wider Monitoring Area for a little longer would, therefore, be
prudent. However, we will keep the situation under constant review.
The European rules provide for the area to be lifted only when at
least 30 days have elapsed since the last positive sample was
collected. My aim is to return poultry keepers to normal business
arrangements as quickly as possible.

Animal Health is contacting keepers in the area to advise them of how
the changes will affect them. In addition, we are reminding all
keepers that the country remains at a constant, albeit low, risk from
H5N1. Therefore, it is vital that keepers remain vigilant and take
precautionary measures to isolate kept birds from wild birds.

[An epidemiology report "HIGHLY PATHOGENIC AVIAN INFLUENZA H5N1 IN
WILD SWANS IN DORSET," prepared by the National Emergency
Epidemiology Group and published on 12 Feb 2008, included in its
Executive Summary -- among others -- the following statements:

- Analysis of the virus indicates that it is related to contemporary
viruses from continental Europe and is most closely related to a
cluster of isolates recovered in mid to late 2007 from wild and
domestic birds in the Czech Republic, Romania and Poland.

- The source of infection for swans has not been identified, however
the most plausible hypothesis is that it was introduced by one of the
migratory wild birds that make up part of the population on the Fleet
during the winter."
