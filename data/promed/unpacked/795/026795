Panama: 4th Case of Hantavirus Infection Reported in Veraguas Province
--------------------------------------------------
The Panamanian health authorities reported that, so far in 2004, 10
cases of human hantavirus infection have been detected in the
country; the most recent occurred last week [2nd week of April]. No
deaths have been reported.
Fernando Gracia, Minister of Health, told the media that the latest
case was detected in the area of Sona, in the central province of
Veraguas, approximately 248 miles west of the capital city. The
patient is a 40-year-old male whose samples were sent to a laboratory
of the Gorgas Institute in the capital for testing.
Gracia reported that cases have been registered in different areas of the
country and explained that, while there is no epidemic or outbreak of
hantavirus in Panama, the disease has arrived in the country and will stay.
[In fact, the disease has probably been there as long as the indigenous
rodents that are its reservoir, but has only been diagnosable in humans in
recent years. - Mod.JW]
The minister also urged the population to implement several measures
to stop the propagation of the virus, such as avoiding deforestation
and the burning of trees & inadequate disposal of garbage, and
preserving gardens around houses, among others.
According to official data, as of December 2003, 39 cases of
hantavirus infection had been confirmed, 9 of them fatal, since the
1st case was reported in Panama in 1999.
