The mayor of Beirut insisted Friday [19 Aug 2011] that the horse
disease that led to the recent culling of 21 animals at the capital's
Hippodrome has been contained and that a final report will soon be
issued by the Agriculture Ministry.

Holding a news conference at the site, Bilal Hamad said all relevant
procedures had been taken and that there was no possibility that the
disease could be spread to humans.

While only 2 horses had tested positive for the disease, a further 19
were eventually destroyed. All horses were buried on site.

Hamad insisted that this was in line with regulations. "We were asked,
as owners of the land and as the Municipality, how could we put these
animals to death and bury them here?" But, he added: "There is a
regulation by the Agriculture Ministry which states that you have to
bury the animals in the exact area where they exhibited the disease."

The initial 2 horses, Hamad explained, had been brought into the
country from a farm in Syria, around which there were "question
marks;" but as soon as the 1st symptoms were discovered, all horses in
that stable were quarantined.

Samples were taken from the horses under the supervision of the
Agriculture Ministry and the World Organization for Animal Health and
sent to Germany to be tested. But, before the results were available,
some of the horses began displaying signs of the disease, and so a
further 19 animals were put down.

Dr. Elie Rizkallah, resident veterinarian at the Hippodrome, said this
was done as a precautionary measure. "When you test an animal for the
disease, there could be many reasons to have a false positive, so it's
very difficult to know for certain whether a horse has it. But
international regulations stipulate that if a horse displays only 2
suspicious signs of the disease, you have to put the horse down."

Glanders disease is highly contagious, and while normally found in
horses, mules, and donkeys, it can spread to humans and can be fatal.
A neighborhood group in nearby Ras al-Nabaa had voiced concern over a
possible outbreak of the disease in humans.

Hamad stated Friday [19 Aug 2011] that all necessary measures had been
taken to prevent this transmission.

The 2 grooms who were in contact with the original 2 horses before it
was known they had the disease underwent full blood tests, which came
back negative.

Members of the Hippodrome staff were tested Friday [19 Aug 2011]
during the news conference for any visual symptoms, but none were said
to have displayed any signs.

Although glanders disease bacteria cannot survive in soil, Hamad
continued, the 21 horses were buried far from any groundwater sources,
under the guidance of hydro-geological experts.

Hamad also announced a new measure which specifies that any horses
entering Lebanon must first undergo a period of quarantine, during
which they will be subjected to more vigorous testing.

Rizkallah said that efforts to investigate the disease had been
thorough. "Until now, we have dealt with around 1000 horses from
across Lebanon -- around 80 percent of all horses in the country --
and we have not seen any signs of the disease," Rizkallah said.

Nabil Nasrallah, the director of the Society for the Protection and
Improvement of the Arabian Horse in Lebanon, which runs the track,
hopes the Hippodrome, one of only 2 legal horse-racing courses in the
region, will not be negatively affected by the controversy.

"I'm sure that the disease is over, but according to international
regulations, we have to do tests for 6 months," Nasrallah said. Once
the 6 months are up, the Agriculture Ministry will release its
"all-clear" report, Hamad said, and then a 2nd report allowing
horse-breeders to again export.

[Lebanon's notification to the OIE of 11 Jul 2011 said that the nature
of diagnosis was "Clinical" and "Laboratory," which may be indicative
of clinical cases; however, no further information was included. In
view of the somewhat blurred data in the current, media-derived
report, clearer information will, hopefully, become available.

OIE's Scientific Commission for Animal Diseases discussed glanders
during its meeting of 7-10 Sep 2010. The meeting's report included the
following summary
(http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Internationa_Standard_Setting/docs/pdf/A_SCAD_sept2010.pdf):

"Outbreak of glanders in the Middle East: The Commission was briefed
on the situation of glanders in the Middle East and the preliminary
findings of an expert mission that visited the region. The Commission
was requested to consider reviewing the current chapter on glanders in
the Terrestrial Code. A 2nd mission to the region was planned by the
OIE with the possibility of having a workshop/discussion forum on the
disease organised by the OIE in early 2011. The Commission concluded
that there were unresolved issues and uncertainties and that it would
be advisable to postpone a definite decision on the way forward
[until] after the completion of the 2nd mission to the region and
pending the outcome and recommendations of the workshop/discussion
forum planned by the OIE."

According to previous information, Syria was suspected as a common
potential source of recent glanders outbreaks in Bahrain and Lebanon.
This suspicion is supported also by the information included in the
current report. Though the prevailing political circumstances in Syria
are less than optimal, updated epidemiological information on the
actual glanders situation there is essential.

Please refer also to the commentary in 20110731.2302.

A follow-up OIE report from Lebanon is anticipated. - Mod.AS]
