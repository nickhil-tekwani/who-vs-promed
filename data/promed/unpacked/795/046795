(date of previous outbreak of classical swine fever in domestic pigs in
Luxembourg reported to the OIE: October 2002).
Emergency report (translation of information received on 14 August 2003
from Dr Arthur Besch, director of the Veterinary Services Department,
Ministry of Agriculture, Viticulture and Rural Development, Luxembourg)
Report date: 14 August 2003.
Date of suspicion: 12 August 2003.
Date of confirmation of diagnosis: 13 August 2003.
Outbreaks:
Registration No. 2003/01
Location: Locality of Buschrodt, County of Redange (central-western part of
the country)
Description of affected population: breeding/fattening farm with 1095 pigs.
Source of agent/origin of infection: the first epidemiological
investigations indicate a possible contact with wild boar, as a wild pig
killed at 3 km distance from the farm gave positive polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) results on 13 August 2003.
Control measures:
- on 13 August 2003 stamping out was applied on this farm, on a pig farm
with 122 pigs, located within the 1 km radius zone, as well as on a contact
farm with 134 pigs.
- until further notice, there is a ban on all pig movements in Luxembourg,
with the exception of transportation to slaughterhouses.

[In February 2002 an outbreak of classical swine fever occurred in
commercial pigs in Luxembourg resulting from an infection by contact with a
wild boar. The references at the beginning of the report indicate at least
8 commercial farms being infected as of June, 2002. It is not uncommon for
classical swine fever to be associated with wild boars in this region but
once it is spread into commercial farms, the eradication is obviously more
complicated and costly. - Mod.PC]
