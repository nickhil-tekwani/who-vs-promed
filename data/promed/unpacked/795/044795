How many times will this matter of sludge used in the raw materials for meat
and bone meal (MBM) "resurge" in the international press? How come no UK
media reacted in June 1999 when it came out in the French media? Nor in
August 1999 when it came out in the German media?
So let me explain the whole situation from the beginning.
The European and the French regulations prohibit the use of certain raw
materials for the making of animal feed, among them "sludge", which
definition is not clear. France has decided to prohibited all waste which
they are not sure is safe. The French regulation prohibits even more, since
no 'fallen' stock, nor parts of animals not found wholesome at the
slaughterhouse, nor Specified Risk Materials regarding BSE (Bovine
Spongiform Encephalopathy, mad cow disease) can enter the food or feed
chain. [Food for humans, feed for animals - Mod.JW
Then of course, these regulations must be applied by all, and this needs
controls. One who does not control will avoid scandal, but maybe won't avoid
public health problems. So the French authorities, and especially since the
BSE crisis in 1996 and after, went on with thorough controls of feed plants,
especially producers of meat and bone meal for animal feed (which has been
prohibited in bovine feed since 1990, but remains authorized for pig and
poultry). As we could have guessed, these controls led to findings of
irregularities or frauds. A control that leads to [a finding of "everything
is OK" is not a control.
The plants that were controlled collected all parts of (fit and sound)
animals coming from slaughterhouses, cutting plants and butchers, but not
used for human food, such as tiny cuts, fat, aponeurosis, bones, etc. When
they wash the ground, all sorts of little parts used to be taken back from
the sewage tank, whether from the first filter, or after decantation for the
fat.
This has been prohibited since the early 90s. I would like to point out that
to my knowledge, European countries are the only countries among those which
produce MBM, to have enforced this regulation. The conclusions of the
control led to actions against the plants at fault, and in April 1999 new
controls concluded to the conformity of the production (sic). These facts
only prove that controls are in force and effective.
Now about the public health issue. Indeed, these regulations aim at
protecting animal and human health. Nevertheless, in this case, there isn't
nor was there any risk, as the waste was coming from animals fit and sound,
and was afterwards treated as prescribed by EU (European Union) regulations,
i.e. 20 minutes at a 133Â°C temperature and 3 bars pressure.
The surveillance plan on food or feed never showed any increase in chemical
contamination, nor did the vets find any sign of a health problem in
breeding stocks.
The European Commission (EC) sent a investigative mission to France, which
concluded to the good, correction of the problems found in the plants, but
of course also urged France to better organize the fight against fraud and
assure the Commission everything is clear in the rest of the French plants.
It did not raise a public health issue, only asked for the result of
residues surveillance plans, and no action whatsoever was taken against
French animal production by the Commission nor by individual member states.
France has called for a rapid clarification of the regulation and
harmonization of the controls on this matter throughout the EU. M. David
Byrne, EU Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection, confirmed that it
is wrong to consider France had "misbehaved", and on the contrary, French
authorities were willing to make the MBM production better.
The whole problem is in fact wider : what can we use to make animal feed?
UK has totally banned the use of MBM for animal feed, for fear of BSE agent
recycling.
France has already banned many raw materials used by nearly all the other
countries. The use of fallen stock for example is spread worldwide, but
prohibited in France, for fear of BSE but also as more of a precaution
against any other risk, even those not yet identified today. It is a
technical, economical, sanitary and ethical issue. And a worldwide debate.
