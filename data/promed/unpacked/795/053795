With warming weather, pig high fever disease [PHFD] has reemerged in
some southern provinces. PHFD is serious in Sichuan, Henan, and other
large pig breeding provinces, and in some places there is a high
mortality rate among infected pigs.

The culling rate on affected pig farms reaches 70 percent with
significant declines in stocks. Breeder enthusiasm to increase stocks
has suffered severe blows. And with the high price of piglets, there
is no room for optimism about increases in pig stocks in
disease-affected areas.

After large volumes of pigs were unloaded on the market before the
holidays, pig stocks fell further. Now, prevention and control of the
PHFD epidemic will have a direct impact on the level of pig stocks
nationwide. If this year's [2007] undiagnosed high fever is national
in scope as it was last year [2006], spreading widely, it will cause
a decline in pig stocks and this year's pig prices may be in a
similar situation as last year.

[Subscribers are referred to China's official report to the OIE
(World Animal Health Organization) on "Swine High Fever Disease,"
(SHFD) submitted on 14 Sep 2006. The report was reproduced in
ProMED-mail's posting archived 20060924.2732, accompanied by Mod.PC's
comprehensive commentary.

According to said report, SHFD is related to the mixed infection of 3
viruses, namely the agents of classical swine fever [CSF], porcine
reproductive and respiratory syndrome [PRRS], and porcine circovirus
[PCV-2]. In addition, some samples were positive for Aujeszky's
disease, _Streptococcus suis_, pasteurellosis, and porcine contagious
pleuropneumonia infection. Samples that tested positive for PRRS,
CFS, or PCV-2 accounted for 96.5 percent of the total of the samples
tested. African swine fever [ASF] was excluded.

The official report to the OIE also mentioned a similar swine disease
that has been seen during the last few years in some southern
provinces of China. As opposed to SHFD as described earlier, the
southern disease syndrome was seasonal, restricted to hot summers,
and affected certain areas along the Yangtze River, mainly in the
provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jangxi, Anhui, and Jiagsu. This
description, which will, for convenience, be temporarily denominated
by us "Southern SHFD", resembles the reemerging swine disease
described in the current posting.

The etiology/ies of SHFD and "Southern SHFD" is/are not yet unfolded,
justifying a thorough research effort. We will continue to refer to
SHFD as "undiagnosed" until a more definitive diagnosis is
established, either as a multifactorial syndrome resulting from mixed
infections with particular agents or when a definite single disease
agent is identified.

New epidemiological or diagnostic developments regarding this
hitherto undiagnosed disease, in the world's leading pig producing
country, will be posted when available. - Mod.AS]
