Bolivian authorities declared a health alert Friday on a town settled by
Japanese immigrants after a man was discovered to have [been infected with
a hantavirus, officials said. The disease was detected when the man, an
indigenous Guarani trader and fisherman, became ill and was taken to a
hospital in Chile. He is believed to have picked up the deadly virus in
his hometown of Okinawa [Bolivia, 580 kilometers (360 miles) east of [La
Paz.
A team of specialists from Bolivia's Epidemiology Department went to the
town, inhabited by a flourishing Nisei [Japanese immigrant community, to
see if there were other cases in the area.
Measures were taken against the spreading of the disease [meaning?, while
blood samples from the man have been sent to [CDC/Atlanta, United States,
the newspaper El Deber reported.
