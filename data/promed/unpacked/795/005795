Brazil: Vampire Bats May Have Been Responsible for 22 Deaths in Para state
---------------------------------------------------
Up to 22 people may have died after being bitten by rabies-carrying vampire
bats in Brazil's Amazon state of Para, scientists say. Amiraldo Pinheiro,
director of Para state's epidemic research centre, said 17 deaths from
rabies had been confirmed in people known to have been bitten by bats. In
5 more cases the deceased showed typical rabies symptoms but were buried
without an autopsy. 15 of the confirmed deaths were in the remote riverside
Portel area, next to the world's biggest estuarine archipelago of Marajo
and 2 more, including the latest on 19 May 2004, in Viseu region some 280
miles (450 km) to the east.
Pinheiro said epidemiologists from the state health authority found about
1130 people who had been bitten by the thumb-sized bats over the past 12
months in Viseu and about 600 people in Portel. Health ministry
representatives arrived in Para on Mon 24 May 3004 to help study the outbreak.
Rabies has an incubation period of [up to] a year, during which vaccine has
to be applied. Otherwise, rabies leads to death in 100 percent of cases.
[It is generally considered that the incubation period for rabies is
variable depending on species and site of bite, and may extend up to one
year. Post-exposure vaccination should be carried out as soon after
exposure as possible. - Mod.CP] All bite victims received vaccines and
other anti-rabies treatment [immunoglobulin?], and Pinheiro said the
situation was now under control with an awareness campaign among the
population.
"Cattle and pets deaths will show whether bats keep attacking, but we hope
there will be no more deaths among humans," he said. Deforestation is one
of the suspected reasons for bat attacks on humans, as it could have
changed bats' migration patterns. Vampire bats normally feed on the blood
of large birds and sleeping cattle, lapping it from cuts they make with
their teeth. They often transmit rabies to cattle. They are not aggressive
and fly away if scared.
