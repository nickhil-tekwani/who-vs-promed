According to Wageningen University and Research (WUR), avian influenza continues to impact Dutch poultry farms. Last week, 3 flocks tested positive for H5N1. A flock of 5000 laying hens in Lunteren tested positive last Sunday [14 Aug 2022]. On Monday [15 Aug 2022], 76 000 laying hens tested positive for H5N1 on a farm in Schore. Later that week on Wednesday [17 Aug 2022], 24 000 broiler breeders in Maurik were hit with the same strain of avian influenza.

The university report shows one more potential case in Lunteren, which has been under investigation since it was reported on Thursday [18 Aug 2022]. The farm involved is located in Lunteren; 3000 ducks could potentially be impacted.

[According to a press release from the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, the 3000 ducks on the affected holding in Lunteren, as well as the poultry population of another commercial farm situated within a radius of 1 km (0.62 mi), have been culled.

All HPAI outbreaks diagnosed in the Netherlands since October 2021, when the HPAI H5N1 outbreak started, are presented on an interactive map available (in Dutch) on the website of the Wageningen University at https://www.wur.nl/nl/onderzoek-resultaten/onderzoeksinstituten/bioveterinary-research/show-bvr/vogelgriep-bij-pluimvee-in-20212022.htm.

A new outbreak of bird flu has been found at a poultry farm in Norfolk, officials said. The latest case of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza was confirmed in commercial poultry at a premises close to Gayton, near King's Lynn.

A 3-km (1.86 mi) protection zone and 10-km (6.21 mi) surveillance zone have been put in place to prevent spread of the disease and all the poultry on the premises are being culled, the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) said. It is the latest in a wave of cases of bird flu to hit poultry flocks and captive birds across the UK in the past year.

[The 2021-2022 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) epidemic season has become the largest epidemic so far observed in Europe. The HPAI (H5) virus in wild birds may have become endemic in wild bird populations in Europe. The event has recently been reviewed in a scientific report of EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) by experts of several European institutions (see citation below). Its abstract (slightly abridged) follows.

Citation: EFSA (European Food Safety Authority), ECDC (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control), EURL (European Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza), Adlhoch C, Fusaro A, Gonzales JL, et al. Scientific report: avian influenza overview March-June 2022. EFSA J. 2022; 20(8): 7415; https://doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2022.7415
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Between 16 Mar and 10 Jun 2022, 1182 HPAI virus detections were reported in 28 EU/EEA countries and UK in poultry (750), and in wild (410) and captive birds (22). During this reporting period, 86% of the poultry outbreaks were secondary due to between-farm spread of HPAI virus. France accounted for 68% of the overall poultry outbreaks, Hungary for 24% and all other affected countries for less than 2% each. Most detections in wild birds were reported by Germany (158), followed by the Netherlands (98) and the United Kingdom (48). The observed persistence of HPAI (H5) virus in wild birds since the 2020-2021 epidemic wave indicates that it may have become endemic in wild bird populations in Europe, implying that the health risk from HPAI A(H5) for poultry, humans, and wildlife in Europe remains present year-round, with the highest risk in the autumn and winter months. Response options to this new epidemiological situation include the definition and the rapid implementation of suitable and sustainable HPAI mitigation strategies such as appropriate biosecurity measures and surveillance strategies for early detection measures in the different poultry production systems. Medium- to long-term strategies for reducing poultry density in high-risk areas should also be considered. The results of the genetic analysis indicate that the viruses currently circulating in Europe belong to clade 2.3.4.4b. HPAI A(H5) viruses were also detected in wild mammal species in Canada, USA and Japan, and showed genetic markers of adaptation to replication in mammals. Since the last report [January-March 2022], 4 A(H5N6), 2 A(H9N2) and 2 A(H3N8) human infections were reported in China and one A(H5N1) in the USA. The risk of infection is assessed as low for the general population in the EU/EEA, and low to medium for occupationally exposed people."
