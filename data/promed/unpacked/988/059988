Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever proves deadly in Iran
------------------------------------------------------
Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) has killed 8 people in Iran
this year while at least 63 people have contracted the disease.

"No less than 8 individuals across the country have died of CCHF in
recent months, and 63 more are believed to have been infected," said
Mohammad Reza Shirzadi, head of Iran Ministry of Health's Zoonoses
Disease Department.

"Past history of tick bite, livestock slaughtering, presence of a
designated place for animals at home, keeping livestock in the house,
and contact history with livestock are among the factors that must be
studied on any suspected patients," the health official said.

In 2008 CCHF infected 120 people of whom 19 died.

Several cases of CCHF, an arboviral disease [CCHF is transmitted by
ticks (arachnid), not by insects and other arthropods - Mod.CP], have
been reported since the summer of 1999 across different areas of
Iran. Health officials aim to determine the most important means and
patterns of transmission and the epidemiologic characteristics of this disease.

[Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a viral haemorrhagic
fever of the Nairovirus group. Although primarily a zoonosis,
sporadic cases and outbreaks of CCHF affecting humans do occur. The
disease is endemic in many countries in Africa, Europe and Asia, and
during 2001, cases or outbreaks have been recorded in Kosovo,
Albania, Iran, Pakistan, and South Africa.

The disease was 1st described in the Crimea in 1944 and given the
name Crimean haemorrhagic fever. In 1969 it was recognized that the
pathogen causing Crimean haemorrhagic fever was the same as that
responsible for an illness identified in 1956 in the Congo, and
linkage of the 2 place names resulted in the current name for the
disease and the virus. CCHF is a severe disease in humans, with a
high mortality rate. Fortunately, human illness occurs infrequently,
although animal infection may be more common.
