I hope this report (Influenza, avian - Italy (04)- mod.PC is misleading in
one particular. Movement of positive birds to slaughter immediately upon
diagnosis is extremely dangerous since large amounts of virus are still
being shed. It is generally much safer to wait 5-7 days until the shed
rate drops. Same thing is generally true for depopulation efforts. If
they're diagnosing on mortality/signs and shipping immediately to
slaughter, control will only be achieved when they run out of susceptibles.

[An excellent comment, particularly with influenza virus. The smaller
number of animals the virus passes into before control of the outbreak is
achieved, the better off everyone is. Thus, moving the birds to slaughter
when they are shedding large amounts of virus is not a good choice. Thanks
for highlighting this nuance to those unfamiliar with how we "stamp out"
disease outbreaks. - Mod.PC
[How are they disposing of the birds? If they are taking them to slaughter
then I agree with this, however, are they euthanizing them on premises and
burning or burying them? This is important in disease control. A number of
premises involved are cleaned by having the animals euthanized on site and
burned or buried there, therefore, no transport is involved. - Mod.TG
