The deadly African swine fever [ASF] has been discovered in Korea, putting the quarantine authorities on alert.

According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs on Sunday [26 Aug 2018], a virus gene of the disease was found in 2 processed pork products that were brought in and voluntarily reported by 2 travelers who visited Shenyang, China, earlier this month [August 2018].

The highly contagious pig disease was 1st reported on 3 Aug 2018 in the northeastern Chinese city of Shenyang.

Quarantine officials conducted a polymerase chain reaction test, which detected the virus gene. They are currently checking whether the virus gene is alive. The final test results are expected to be released Monday [27 Aug 2018].

"The travelers brought in banned products including one Korean sausage and one pack of dumplings and voluntarily reported to quarantine officials at the airport," the agriculture ministry said, adding that the products were disposed of.

"The products have been heated up, so there is little possibility the virus could be contagious."

Since April 2018, the quarantine agency has been keeping close tabs on the ASF virus, closely monitoring banned animal products coming into the country at airports and harbors.

The African swine fever virus is the causative agent of African swine fever. The virus causes a haemorrhagic fever with high mortality rates in pigs.

The virus can be spread by eating the product or through direct contact with secretions from the infected pig, and indirectly spread through feedboxes and other products that had contact with the infected animal.

Pigs infected with the virus tend to have a fever of up to 42 C [107.6 F] and lose their appetites. Dermohemia, blue spots, and miscarriage are some of the symptoms of infection. The incubation period ranges from 4 to 21 days.

The virus does not affect people, but once pigs are infected, the fatality rate is 100 percent as there is no vaccine or treatment for infected animals.

"Banned products brought into the country could contain the African swine fever virus, so people who are scheduled to arrive from China are advised not to bring in agriculture goods," the ministry said. "If they accidently bring products, they should voluntarily report the items to avoid getting fined."

Agriculture Minister Lee Gae-ho visited Incheon International Airport over the weekend to review whether the airport was taking proper quarantine measures against the disease.

"The Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency needs to enhance screening of agricultural products of travelers and better manage leftover food from airlines and vessels," Lee said. "We urge travelers to refrain from traveling to disease-infected areas and bringing back banned products. Travelers should abide by government safety regulations."

The quarantine agency plans to strengthen screening measures by conducting exhaustive X-ray searches of passengers' baggage and deploying quarantine detection dogs on inbound flights from China.

[The confiscated processed pork products introduced by passengers on flight from China's Shenyang province may have been tested weeks after their arrival in the South Korean airport.

The measures undertaken by the South Korean airport authorities to prevent the introduction of ASF virus, fortunately successful in the described case, are in line with guidelines detailed in the following useful publications of the FAO:

1. African swine fever: detection and diagnosis - A manual for veterinarians. FAO Animal Production and Health Manual No. 19. Rome. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). 88 pages. http://www.fao.org/3/i7228en/I7228EN.pdf. Subscribers are specifically referred to the chapter "Risk analysis and import/export procedures" (page 63).

2. FAO. 2011. Good Emergency Management Practices: The Essentials. FAO Animal Production and Health Manual No. 11. Rome.
http://www.fao.org/3/a-ba0137e.pdf. Subscribers are specifically referred to the chapters "Quarantine at international airports, seaports and mail exchanges," "illegal imports," and "Controls on feeding unprocessed meat products and waste food (swill)" (pages 32-35).

Customs, regulatory and quarantine services should be equipped to effectively intercept illegal/unregulated foodstuffs and other hazardous materials at international airports, seaports, and border crossings. Confiscated materials should be destroyed or disposed of safely and not dumped within reach of scavengers (animals and humans). Past events suggest that particular attention should be paid to the proper disposal of waste food from aircraft, ships, or vehicles from infected countries, preferably by incineration or, if available, by rendering.

Introduction of ASF into hitherto uninfected countries/regions outside Africa have been recorded several times in the past. The earliest such event involved the spread of ASF to Portugal in 1957 as a result of waste from airline flights being fed to pigs near Lisbon airport.

In 2007, ASF genotype II virus, previously described from Mozambique and Madagascar, that is not related to the Genotype I virus which previously invaded Europe, is likely to have been introduced to Europe in waste that was available to free-ranging pigs around the port of Poti on the Georgian Black Sea coast. This virus has since been spreading northwards, westwards, and eastwards (reaching Irkutsk in March 2017; see 20170328.4929925), eventually reaching China. - Mod.AS
