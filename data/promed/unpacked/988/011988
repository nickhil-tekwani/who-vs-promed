Re: Undiagnosed deaths, wild yak - China (Qinghai): RFI
-----------------------------------------------
Several reports from central media pointed out that the deaths of the
9 wild yaks were natural and that initial investigation had
attributed their deaths to old age and lack of grass (food) [see
comment].
The report also pointed out that all yaks were male and had no gun
wounds. No signs of infectious disease were found. Some of them died
one or 2 months ago; some just died recently. Only one yak died from
fighting (with other yaks). All dead yaks showed reduced fat
deposits. The report also pointed out that, if the animals died from
infectious disease, some of them might be expected to show normal fat
deposits.

[There are several discrepancies between the above piece of news and
the previous one. The 1st posting (20050410.1039) excluded old age as
a possible factor, reported that the number of dead yaks exceeded 10,
and indicated that the yaks died "at the same time within a small
area." The present report relates to 9 cases, mentions old age as a
factor, and says that the mortality has extended over a 2-month
period.
If emaciation has indeed been observed in all dead yaks, its cause
could be malnutrition, parasitic infestation or infectious diseases;
these do not exclude a multi-factorial etiology possibly enhanced by
environmental-climatic background. It will be interesting to obtain
confirmation of the observation that only male yaks were affected.
We are looking forward to a 1st-hand report and to the outcome of the
investigation allegedly carried out by the local department for
animal epidemic prevention, mentioned in the 1st posting. - Mod.AS]
