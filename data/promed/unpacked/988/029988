Acute respiratory syndrome - Republic of Korea
------------------------------------------------------
On 29 Oct 2015, the National IHR Focal Point of the Republic of Korea notified WHO of a cluster of cases with respiratory symptoms in Seoul. Between [19 and 29 Oct 2015], 3 people who work in the same facility developed symptoms of pneumonia. From [22 to 24 Oct 2015], they were admitted to hospital. On [27 Oct 2015], the hospital isolated the patients and alerted local health authorities, which then informed the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC).

Additional information on the outbreak
-------------------------------------------
To date, 84 cases with respiratory symptoms have been identified; 55 of them were diagnosed with pneumonia and 29 cases were mildly symptomatic. The 55 patients with pneumonia were isolated in 7 different hospitals while the 29 patients with mild symptoms were under home quarantine.

As of [11 Nov 2015], only 1 of the 55 patients with pneumonia was still hospitalized; the other 54 cases had all been discharged. Currently, none of the patients is in critical condition.

Public health response
----------------------
In response to the outbreak, KCDC and the government of the Republic of Korea have implemented a series of public health measures: issued daily press releases to the public; conducted contact tracing -- 1664 contacts have been monitored on a daily basis; established a hotline for reporting potentially-linked cases; requested hospitals to report pneumonia cases with potential links to the cluster; closed and disinfected the affected facility.

So far, all PCR tests carried out by the KCDC have been negative, including for adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, metapneumovirus, bocavirus, influenza virus, and coronavirus (including MERS-CoV), as well as for _Mycoplasma_, _Chlamydia_, _Corynebacterium_, __Bordetella_, Brucella_, _Coxiella_, and _Legionella_.

At present, there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission. Investigation on the cause of the outbreak is ongoing.
