Death toll from contaminated grain rises to 51
--------------------------------------------------
The death toll amongst people who recently ate contaminated grain in 3
Kenyan districts has risen to 51, the Ministry of Health said on Monday.
The grain had been contaminated with aflatoxin, a poisonous fungus that
grows on cereals harvested or stored under damp [or humid] conditions, it
added.
A total of 97 cases had been reported in the districts of Makueni, Kitui
and Thika since 6 May 2004, a statement issued in Nairobi by the Chief
Public Health Officer, Alfred Langat, said. At least 34 deaths occurred in
Makueni, the district where 58 of the total reported cases occurred.
According to the ministry, poisoning had occurred after consumption of the
contaminated food on which the fungi had grown, because the grain was
either harvested before it was dry or had been poorly stored or transported.
Exposure to large amounts of aflatoxin over a short period causes acute
liver damage and subsequent death, while the ingestion of small amounts
over a longer period can cause a cancer of the liver, the ministry
statement added.
It said medical officials in the affected districts had been put on high
alert and had launched an awareness campaign to prevent further spread of
the problem. The government had also distributed maize, beans and vegetable
oils to people in the most affected areas of Kitui and Makueni.
At the same time, residents of the affected districts had been advised to
harvest grain and legumes only when they were completely dry, and to ensure
sieving before storage in dry and well-ventilated stores where the
foodstuffs would be protected from pests and vermin. They had also been
warned against eating food that had changed colour or had moulds.
Signs of aflatoxin poisoning included yellow eyes, vomiting, abdominal and
leg swelling, general weakness, drowsiness, coma and death, the statement said.

Toxic grain kills 26 Kenyans
------------------------
At least 48 people have died in Kenya's Eastern Province in the past 3
weeks after consuming maize that became poisonous because of humid storage
conditions, a medical official said on Wednesday.
"At least 34 people have died of the same symptoms in Makueni district and
14 others in Kitui district by this morning (Wednesday)," the ministry
official who asked not to be named, said by telephone.
The official said that a total of 102 cases of aflatoxin poisoning - the
result of fungal growth on maize - had been reported in the eastern Makueni
and Kitui districts since May 6, although the problem started around March
this year.

[While the 2 newswires have slightly differing figures, there have been an
increase in at least 10 additional deaths, and it appears as though at
least 100 individuals have had significant health consequences as a result
of this aflatoxin contamination. In the 2001 report of a similar
occurrence (see ProMED-mail Aflatoxicosis, human - Kenya 20011007.2427)
there were reports of 24 cases with 12 deaths in North Meru. - Mod.MPP]
