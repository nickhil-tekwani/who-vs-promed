The State Veterinary Administration (SVA) announced this year's [2020] 2nd outbreak of avian influenza in the Czech Republic on 17 Feb 2020. The outbreak is located in the farm of Moras Moravany in the village of Slepotice [map at https://tinyurl.com/ul3koqz] in the Pardubicky region. The affected farm has both turkeys (7500 heads) as well as approximately 130 000 broiler chickens. Measures include a 3km [approx. 1.8mi] protection zone and a 10km [approx. 6.2mi] surveillance zone.

The breeder on [Sun 16 Feb 2020] reported increased mortality in the breeding of 7500 turkeys, 1300 of which died within 3 days from [Fri 14 Feb to Sun 16 Feb 2020]. In addition, dying poultry showed symptoms suggesting that it could be bird flu. Official veterinarians immediately took samples of dead poultry for testing on the spot and took measures to prevent the possible spread of dangerous outbreaks. An examination of the dead animals carried out at the State Veterinary Institute in Prague this morning [Mon 17 Feb 2020] confirmed that it is a highly pathogenic subtype of avian influenza H5N8. There are also some 130 000 broiler chickens on the farm.

"The entire premises of the company were closed immediately; a disinfection loop will be installed at the entrance to prevent the disease from spreading outside the premises. This evening or tomorrow morning, veterinarians will cull all the [remaining turkeys], which will then be safely disposed of in the sanitation plant", said Minister of Agriculture Miroslav Toman.

The remaining poultry on the holding will be killed and further measures taken to prevent the spread of the disease. "As in the case of the 1st outbreak, located in Stepanov nad Svratkou in the Vysocina Region, a 3km [approx. 1.8 mi] protection zone and a 10km [approx. 6.2mi] surveillance zone will be set out. They shall restrict the movement of poultry, farms shall be kept and other emergency veterinary measures taken. At the same time, the investigation is continuing, the main aim of which is to find out how the infection got into the breeding", said the central director of the State Veterinary Administration Zbynek Semerad.

Due to the favorable disease situation around the outbreak in the Highlands and the 30-day deadline since its announcement, today [Mon 17 Feb 2020] the announcement on the relevant official boards will end the extraordinary veterinary measures for closed zones around the outbreak in Stepanov nad Svratkou.

Avian influenza viruses are commonly found in wild birds and are transmitted mainly through droppings. Therefore, infection is most often caused by the ingestion of feed or water contaminated with faeces of infected birds. Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses cause high morbidity and mortality in birds. In poultry farming, they cause significant direct and indirect economic losses.

Breeders are legally guaranteed compensation for euthanized animals and the MoA also reimburses them for all purposefully spent costs resulting from measures ordered on the spot. Applications for refunds must be made within 6 weeks of the culling. All information is available on the website of the Ministry, where there are contacts to relevant [Ministry's] workers who will help farmers if necessary.

[The Czech media website ceskenoviny reported today 17 Feb 2020 late afternoon, that the causative agent of the event is HPAI H5N8. The culling activities, starting tonight, are to continue until Fri 20 Feb 2020. The damage is estimated by the company to be 10 million crowns (USD 436 248) https://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/na-pardubicku-je-ptaci-chripka-vybijeni-drubeze-zacne-dnes-vecer/1855312 [in Czech].

From late December 2019 to date, 17 Feb 2020, HPAI H5N8 has been reported in wild birds and small poultry holdings in Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Germany, Saudi Arabia and Israel. In difference with earlier outbreaks, the current event affected a commercial enterprise. Farmers in Europe have been alerted to take adequate measures against exposure of their animals to wild birds, in particular during the migration season.

DEFRA's --updated on 12 Feb 2020-- assessment of the H5N8 situation in Europe, including a map presenting the reported outbreaks in poultry and wild birds and the migratory bird flyways, is available at https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/865997/hpai-europe-update10-2020.pdf.
