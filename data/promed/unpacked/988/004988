The initial COVID-19 vaccine campaign in the United States was associated with fewer infections, emergency department (ED) visits, and hospitalizations among adults 65 and older, finds a study yesterday [3 Nov 2021] in The Lancet (https://www.thelancet.com/retrieve/pii/S0140673621022261).

Researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) analyzed population-based COVID-19 data reported to US federal agencies from 1 Nov 2020 to 10 Apr 2021. Starting in mid-December [2020], health care workers were prioritized for vaccines, followed by adults 75 years and older, those aged 65-74, and those 16-64 at high risk for poor COVID-19 outcomes.

COVID-19 vaccination was linked to a 53% reduction in infection among adults aged 65-74 years and a 62% reduction among those 75 years and older, relative to those aged 50-64. Similarly, ED visits decreased 61% in adults 65-74 and 77% in those 75 and older, relative to the younger age group.

Hospitalizations fell 39% among adults aged 60-69 years, 60% in those 70-79 years, and 68% in those 80 and older, compared with the younger age-group. Likewise, COVID-19 deaths dropped a relative 41% among adults 65-74 years and 30% in those 75 and older, but the study authors said the impact of the vaccines on deaths was not clear.

"Although it is not possible to conclusively attribute these declines solely to vaccination given the ecological design of this analysis, these results suggest that the initial phases of the US COVID-19 vaccination programme led to a meaningful reduction in COVID-19 burden among US people aged 65 years and older, a group at high risk of severe outcomes from COVID-19," the researchers wrote.

In a commentary in the same journal (https://bit.ly/31DFZZG), Justin Ortiz and Kathleen Neuzil, both of the University of Maryland, said that it will be important to evaluate public health outcomes in diverse settings because of differences in circulation and the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants, vaccines and vaccination schedules, and the diversity of targeted populations.

"Future COVID-19 vaccine impact studies in the USA will need to be timely to keep pace with critical public health needs," they wrote. "Finally, as the largest vaccine roll-out in history expands even further, we must ensure that low-income and lower-middle-income countries are supported in their efforts to establish immunisation programme monitoring and evaluation to guide appropriate and context-specific decision making."

[B] Study: bamlanivimab
Date: Thu 4 Nov 2021

A new case-control study shows the monoclonal antibody bamlanivimab offered good protection against hospitalization in 1257 adult US outpatients who were either 65 or older or obese. The study was published yesterday [3 Nov 2021] in Open Forum Infectious Disease (https://academic.oup.com/ofid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ofid/ofab546/6420437).

The patients in the study sought treatment in the Mass General Brigham (MGB) health system, where a lottery system had been put in place for the monoclonal antibody therapy beginning in December 2020. This study was based on patients who entered the lottery from 9 Dec 2020 and 25 Feb 2021 and were 65 years and older and had a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.

According to the researchers, patients who received bamlanivimab had a statistically significant, 68% reduction in the odds of hospitalization, and a statistically significant difference in the odds of death (odds ratio [OR], 0.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0 to 0.25; P < 0.01) compared with those who did not receive bamlanivimab.

Despite the promising results, bamlanivimab is no longer administered alone, only in combination with other monoclonal antibody therapies, per the Food and Drug Administration. "Not withstanding these limitations, the study supports the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy for COVID-19 under real world conditions in reducing the rate of hospitalization for adult patients with BMI ≥ 35 or age ≥ 65 and suggests that there may be a mortality benefit in this population," the authors concluded.

[2] Covaxin
[A] India: emergency use authorization
Date: Wed 3 Nov 2021

The World Health Organization (WHO) today [3 Nov 2021] announced that it has issued an emergency use listing for India's Covaxin vaccine, clearing the way for its use in the COVAX program that is a key part of reaching immunization targets. The addition of another vaccine to the COVAX portfolio also comes as global cases are rising again, following several weeks of decline.

Covaxin, developed by Bharat Biotech, is an inactivated vaccine given in 2 doses 4 weeks apart in adults. It is the 8th vaccine given emergency use approval by WHO. Clinical studies suggest the vaccine has 78% efficacy against any COVID-19 severity. WHO's vaccine advisors said the easy storage requirements make it a suitable option for low- and middle-income countries.

In a statement, Mariangela Simao, WHO's assistant director general for access to medicines and health products, said the emergency use listing expands the most effective tools for ending the pandemic. "But we must keep up the pressure to meet the needs of all populations, giving priority to the at-risk groups who are still waiting for their 1st dose, before we can start declaring victory."

The vaccine was evaluated by 2 WHO advisory groups, the Technical Advisory Group, which assesses if the product meets the WHO's standards for protection and weighs the benefits and risks, and the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization, which formulates recommendations.

Data for use of Covaxin in pregnant women are not sufficient for gauging safety and efficacy in the group, and studies are planned to gather more data for that population, WHO said.

Bharat Biotech said in a press release that, as of October [2021], production of the vaccine has scaled up to produce one billion doses a year by the end of 2021 (https://www.bharatbiotech.com/images/press/covaxin-who-approval-press-release.pdf).

Global cases continue to climb
------------------------------
COVID-19 cases rose slightly last week for the 2nd week in a row, up 3% from the week before, mainly driven by another round of surges in some European countries, WHO said yesterday [2 Nov 2021] in its latest weekly update (https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/weekly-epidemiological-update-on-covid-19---2-november-2021).

Deaths were also up, by 8% compared with the previous week, mainly led by rises in South East Asia, Europe, and the Western Pacific regions. The 5 countries reporting the most cases are the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia, Turkey, and Ukraine.

Though cases generally declined in many world regions, many still have continuing or emerging COVID-19 hot spots. For example, in Africa, Rwanda, Comoros, and Eritrea reported sharp spikes, and in the Americas, the largest increases were reported in the Cayman Islands, Uruguay, and Puerto Rico.

More global headlines
---------------------
- China's local COVID-19 cases are at nearly a 3-month high, with 93 new cases reported today [3 Nov 2021] that span 9 provinces and the cities of Beijing and Chongqing, according to the country's National Health Commission. The rise in cases is challenging China's "zero COVID" approach and comes just months before Beijing is slated to host the Winter Olympics. Earlier this week, China's commerce ministry urged the public to stock up on essentials because of anticipated bad weather, energy shortages, and COVID-19 restrictions that could squeeze supplies (http://en.nhc.gov.cn/2021-11/03/c_85035.htm).

- In Europe, Greece (https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/greece-reports-record-high-daily-covid-19-infections-2021-11-01/) and Slovenia (https://www.reuters.com/world/slovenia-records-highest-daily-number-covid-cases-2021-11-03/) reported daily record highs for cases, and the Netherlands brought back masking requirements in stores and other public places amid its rising cases.

[B] USA: approval requested for children below 18
Date: Sat 6 Nov 2021 02:37 IST

https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/bharat-biotechs-covaxin-approval-requested-in-us-for-children-below-18-2600710


US company Ocugen announced Friday [5 Nov 2021] that it had asked authorities for emergency use authorization for COVID-19 vaccine Covaxin, which was developed in India, for children ages 2-18. Ocugen's data, gathered from clinical trials conducted outside of the United States with only a small group of children, may not be enough for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to grant the request.

Covaxin, developed in India by Ocugen's partner, Bharat Biotech, gained emergency approval from WHO on Wednesday [3 Nov 2021] and has already been cleared for use in 17 countries. Tens of millions of doses have been administered to adults outside the US, notably in India. The immunization uses inactivated virus technology, common in other childhood vaccines including polio shots.

The approval request is based on results from a study of 526 kids between ages 2 and 18 who received 2 doses of Covaxin 28 days apart. The findings were compared with those from a group of 25 800 adults in India, which suggested "similar protection in children, ages 2-18, to that demonstrated in adults older than 18 years," the company said.

Ocugen co-founder Shankar Musunuri in a press release called the move "a significant step toward our hope to make our vaccine candidate available here." In the clinical trial with 526 children, no serious adverse events or hospitalizations were observed, but the study's sample size may not have been large enough to detect rare side effects.

The FDA asked Pfizer and Moderna, whose COVID-19 vaccines have already been authorized in the US, to conduct trials with thousands of children to have a better insight into any side effects. Pfizer's shot is the only one approved in the US for children under the age of 18, and health authorities cleared the way this week for 5- to 11-year-olds to receive the vaccine.
