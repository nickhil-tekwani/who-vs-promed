COMPUTER WORM ALERT
************************
A ProMED-mail post
<http://www.promedmail.org>
Date: Fri 17 Dec 1999
From: Phil Temples <phil@promedmail.org>

The W32/Mypics.worm was highlighted on the various evening network news
broadcasts this evening [in the USA]. It attempts to send a file attachment
of the name
"PICS4YOU.EXE" which deletes the contents of a hard disk on 1/1/2000.
Do NOT open any attachment with that name.
See http://vil.mcafee.com/vil/wm10456.asp for particulars.
