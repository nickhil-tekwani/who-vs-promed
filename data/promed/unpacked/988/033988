The People's National Party's Dr Shane Alexis is appealing to the government to provide assistance to cocoa farmers who, he says, have been badly affected by the frosty pod disease. The disease has severely reduced and, in some cases, completely destroyed the yield of cocoa in the area [of St Mary parish].

According to him, the government's initial response, administered by the Quarantine Division of the Ministry of Agriculture, to prune the affected trees has now left many cocoa farmers with trees that cannot produce fruit.

[Frosty pod rot (FPR; also called moniliasis) of cocoa is caused by the fungus _Moniliophthora roreri_. It is an invasive disease that was originally identified in Ecuador in 1917 and spread rapidly to other countries in Latin America during the 1970s. It can cause complete yield loss and is considered a major constraint to cocoa production in the region. FPR reached the northern boundary of the crop with its 1st detection in Mexico in 2006. FPR was detected for the 1st time outside of Latin America in Jamaica's Clarendon parish (ProMED-mail post 20161004.4534271).

FPR-affected pods show large brown lesions on the outside, but these may appear less serious than the associated bean loss inside the pods. Mummies (shrivelled pods) and internal necrosis are also common. The fungus produces large quantities of powdery spores, giving affected pods a frosted appearance. It is a specialised pathogen that invades only actively growing pods of cocoa and related species of _Theobroma_ and _Herrania_, which may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Conventional control measures, including phytosanitation, have failed to halt the progress of FPR. Integrated management strategies suited to smallholders and collaborative resistance breeding programmes are being developed.

The related fungus _M. perniciosa_ causes witches' broom (WB) of cocoa and is spreading in the same region. It has ravaged production in parts of Brazil and led to abandonment of cocoa cultivation in many areas. Both pathogens also pose a potential threat to cocoa growing areas in Africa and Asia if they are introduced there.
