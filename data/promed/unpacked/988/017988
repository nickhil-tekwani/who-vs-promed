There is a dengue alert in Selangor and Federal Territory as 100 suspected
cases of the disease are being reported daily.
Dr Ramlee Rahmat, the Health Ministry's Communicable Disease Control
Division director, said the sudden rise in dengue cases was seen after Hari
Raya last month [the 1st 2 days of Shawal, the 10th month of the Muslim
lunar calendar, is Hari Raya Puasa and marks the end of Ramadan]. "I was
informed that at least 100 people are being seen daily with symptoms of
dengue fever in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur." He said hospitals and health
authorities were directed to thoroughly check all people, including
children, showing signs of dengue fever.
"They may be having just a normal fever, but we do not want to take
chances." He said all state and district health departments have been
directed to step up their checks and take action against those found
breeding _Aedes_ mosquitos.
Local authorities in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur have also been enlisted to
clean up drains and areas with stagnant water.
In the first 9 months of 2004, 10 472 premises were issued notices carrying
fines totalling RM 1.6 million [USD 420 000].
Between January and September [2004], 8273 suffered from dengue fever and
360 from dengue haemorrhagic fever. In that time, 38 people died from dengue
haemorrhagic fever.
Dr Ramlee urged the public to co-operate with health authorities and keep
their surroundings clean, including making sure that their drains were not
clogged.

20 municipalities in Sao Paulo have an elevated risk for dengue
-------------------------------------------------
20 of the 645 municipalities of Sao Paulo state have elevated levels of
infestation by the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_, which transmits dengue.
The State secretary for health published on Monday [3 Jan 2005] the list of
cities which had a Breteau index of 3 or more [see below for explanation of
index. - Mod.JW]. The coastal city of Sao Sebastiao is top of the risk list
with an index of 20.14, followed by the cities of Potim with 13.59 and
Ituverava with 8.
However, in spite of these statistics, the number of cases of dengue
reported for Sao Paulo state fell from 20 361 in 2003 to 3015 in 2004, which
represents a reduction of almost 85 percent.

[The Breteau index is the total number of water containers having larvae
or pupae of _Aedes aegypti_ per 100 houses.
It is often considered to be more reliable than the older House index
(percentage of houses examined with larvae or pupae of _Ae. aegypti_) and
the Container index (percentage of water-holding containers examined with
larvae or pupae of _Ae. aegypti_) in signalling a population density of _Ae.
aegypti_ that threatens transmission of dengue/DHF.
A Breteau index of 35-49 is often taken as the critical threshold for
dengue transmission, but there are several instances where the occurrence
of dengue/DHF has no relationship with either the Breteau or House indices
(e.g see Sulaiman S, Pawanchee ZA, Arifin Z, and Wahab A. (1996).
Relationship between Breteau and House indices and cases of dengue/dengue
hemorrhagic fever in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. _Journal of the American
Mosquito Control Association_ 12, 494-496). In fact there are many
important variables, such as human population density, distances between
houses, single storey versus multi-storey dwellings, and whether positive
water pots contain just a few or many _Ae. aegypti_ larvae, that can be
epidemiologically important in disease transmission. In summary the
relationship between larval or pupal density figures and epidemic risk is
at best dubious. - Mod. MS]

Dengue, situation in Venezuela (epidemiological week 51, 2004)
--------------------------------------------------------------
For the week ending 25 Dec 2004, the Venezuelan Ministry of Health reported
420 cases of dengue, for a year-to-date total of 30 234 cases. This figure
for the same period of 2003 was 25 834.
In the same week there were 37 cases of DHF (8.8 percent) with no deaths,
for a cumulative total (for 2004) of 1953 cases of DHF with 5 deaths.
The dengue case trend has been decreasing over the last 6 weeks. All 4 types
of dengue are co-circulating. The accumulated morbidity rate is 116.2 per
100 000 population.
