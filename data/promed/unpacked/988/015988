A 5th case of measles was confirmed at the end of last week [week of Sun 4 Feb 2018] in a school of the Cite scientifique on the campus of Villeneuve-d'Ascq. The 1st patient was diagnosed in mid-January [2018] and the campus now has 4 students with measles and a teacher-researcher. "A student from Bordeaux infected the others, says a report to the management of the University of Lille.

Screening kits and vaccines have been sent to the Scientifique City health center, among other items. For the moment, only 3 students needed to be vaccinated.

WHO warns over measles immunisation rates as cases rise 400 percent across Europe. 2017 saw more than 21 000 cases and 35 deaths, with large outbreaks in one in 4 countries, says World Health Organisation [WHO]

Measles cases have soared across Europe over the last year [2017], with large outbreaks affecting one in 4 countries, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) which is concerned by low rates of immunisation against the disease.

WHO Europe says there has been a 400 percent increase during 2017, with more than 21 000 cases and 35 deaths. That will be a major disappointment following the record low in 2016, when there were just 5273 cases in Europe.

"Every new person affected by measles in Europe reminds us that unvaccinated children and adults, regardless of where they live, remain at risk of catching the disease and spreading it to others who may not be able to get vaccinated," said Dr Zsuzsanna Jakab, WHO regional director for Europe. "Over 20 000 cases of measles, and 35 lives lost in 2017 alone, are a tragedy we simply cannot accept."

Measles can kill or cause long-term damage. One in every thousand children affected develops encephalitis, which is swelling of the brain and can lead to deafness or learning difficulties.

Measles is targeted for elimination around the world, because of the efficacy of the vaccine, but it has been bedevilled by regular outbreaks. WHO said there were large outbreaks last year [2017] in 15 of the 53 countries in the European region. Romania was worst affected with 5562 cases, followed by Italy with 5006 and Ukraine with 4767.

Immunisation in those countries has hit a number of problems in recent years. There have been declines in overall routine immunisation coverage, consistently low coverage among some marginalised groups, interruptions in vaccine supply or underperforming disease surveillance systems.

Greece (967), Germany (927), Serbia (702), Tajikistan (649), France (520), the Russian Federation (408), Belgium (369), the United Kingdom (282), Bulgaria (167), Spain (152), Czechia (146) and Switzerland (105) also experienced large outbreaks, many of which were in decline by the close of 2017.

Confidence in the MMR - measles, mumps and rubella - vaccine and in immunisation generally has been an issue in Europe and in the United States following the discredited claims of the researcher Andrew Wakefield, who linked the MMR to the development of autism.

WHO released the data ahead of a ministerial meeting on immunisation in Montenegro on [Tue 20 Feb 2018], saying that the drive to eliminate the disease continues. "Elimination of both measles and rubella is a priority goal that all European countries have firmly committed to, and a cornerstone for achieving the health-related Sustainable Development Goals," said Jakab. "This short-term setback cannot deter us from our commitment to be the generation that frees our children from these diseases once and for all."

Europe has been moving closer to the goal, with one country after another reviewed each year by an independent commission, which recommends what should be done to overcome specific challenges such as problems with the supply of vaccines. By the end of 2016, 42 of the 53 countries in the WHO region had interrupted endemic measles transmission. But cases will continue to cross borders and spark outbreaks until all of them - and their neighbours - are measles-free.

Last month [January 2018], Public Health England (PHE) warned that there were measles cases in several regions of England: Sussex, West Midlands, Surrey, Greater Manchester, Merseyside and West Yorkshire. Parents were urged to get their children vaccinated if they had not done so. PHE said anyone who had visited Romania, Germany or Italy might be particularly at risk.

The 1st dose of MMR vaccine is given to babies when they are a year old. The 2nd, which is more often missed, is given just before children start school.

European health officials have released some disturbing news about the spread of measles across the entire continent. The World Health Organization (WHO) says there were over 21 000 cases of the dangerous virus recorded in Europe last year [2017], 4 times the number recorded in 2016.

"Every new person affected by measles in Europe reminds us that unvaccinated children and adults, regardless of where they live, remain at risk of catching the disease and spreading it to others," WHO officials wrote in a [Mon 19 Feb 2018] release. Measles is a very contagious viral infection that causes a rash over the entire body. While most cases last about 2 weeks, some patients can develop dangerous infections in the lungs or even brain swelling from the virus. Up to 35 of the 21 315 cases across Europe last year [2017] were fatal.

As medical professionals urge countries in the region to have their children vaccinated against the illness, blame for the outbreak is falling on a growing anti-vaccination movement around the world. The "anti-vax" movement has claimed that vaccinations typically given to newborns and young children may cause serious side-effects; most notably was the development of autism. While physicians have discredited these claims, the number of parents not getting their children vaccinated or seeking a medical exemption continues to grow in the U.S. and abroad.

"These countries have experienced a range of challenges in recent years, such as declines in overall routine immunization coverage, consistently low coverage among some marginalized groups," WHO added.

In Italy, where there were over 5000 measles cases in 2017, anti-vaxxers reportedly persuaded many Italian parents from having their children immunized. The Italian government is now requiring parents to vaccinate their children against 12 common illnesses before enrolling in any state-run schools.

Only 118 cases of the measles were documented in the United States last year [2017]. According to the CDC, most of the cases were found to be in people who weren't vaccinated.

After a statewide warning from health officials, 6 additional related cases of measles have been reported in Ellis County. The Texas Department of State Health Services is advising health care providers in the area to take precautions. They should also consider measles as a possible diagnosis in patients with a fever, rash, cough, runny nose or conjunctivitis.

Last month [January 2018] a ShowBiz Cinemas in Waxahachie customer was sick with measles while attending a movie. The highly contagious nature of measles means it's possible more cases will occur in the community. People involved in the outbreak have connections to Waxahachie and Midlothian.

Reports say these individuals did not receive any of the 2 vaccines usually administered during their childhood years.

Up to 5 additional cases have been reported since; none of them are connected to the movie theater. People who went to the theater on that day should continue to monitor themselves for measles symptoms.

Measles Symptoms
It usually takes about 2 weeks from the time of exposure to the measles virus for a rash to develop. Although it can take as long as 3 weeks.

People are contagious from 4 days before they get a rash to 4 days after it appears. They should isolate themselves at home during that period, except to seek medical treatment.

The rash usually begins on the face as flat, red spots and then spreads down the neck and trunk to the rest of the body. Other symptoms include a high fever over 101 degrees, cough, runny nose and red, watery eyes.

Anyone with these symptoms who thinks they may have been exposed to measles should contact their health care provider and tell them about the exposure. It's important to call in advance so the provider can take precautions to help prevent staff and other patients from being exposed to measles.

DSHS recently issued a health advisory for health care facilities and providers in the area reminding them of proper infection control, testing and treatment practices for measles.
