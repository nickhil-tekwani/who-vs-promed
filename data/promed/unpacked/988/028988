One person was killed and 73 people were taken to hospital over suspicions they were infected with anthrax in the Black Sea province of Trabzon on [10 Feb 2018]. The incident occurred in Trabzon's Akçabat district.

A cow had been diagnosed with anthrax in Akçabat last week [week of 11 Feb 2018] during a [veterinary] check-up and samples were sent to Ankara for a detailed examination. But the cow's owner reportedly butchered the infected cow and distributed its meat to his neighbors.

Some 73 locals were rushed to the Karadeniz Technical University Hospital when they showed symptoms of fatigue and nausea after eating the cattle's meat.

On [9 Feb 2018], a 39-year-old woman, died in hospital. Officials also said they found traces of anthrax on 3 other people. The Trabzon Governor's Office said an investigation was launched into the incident.

"All the necessary measures have been taken by our relevant institutions. Some of our citizens consumed the meat and fell ill," the governor's office said in a statement. Akçabat district governor, Soner Şenel, said the samples of the meat that had been distributed to the locals are currently being examined in laboratories.

Meanwhile, Ağaçlı neighborhood head, Yüksel Altın, said they have not yet imposed a quarantine. "Nothing is clear yet. There are suspicions that there could be anthrax infection. The results of the lab examinations have not come out yet. A few days ago, [a woman] died. The hospital has reported that she died of anthrax. We have identified those who ate the meat and gave a list of their names to authorities. Many people have been admitted to the hospital in the evening," he added.

[Akçabat is a densely populated district on the NW Turkish coast on the Black Sea (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akçaabat). That 74 people were suspected infected from the meat of this dead cow suggested that the meat was sold in a local street market, not just given to the farmer's neighbors. So far, it is clinically obvious in 3 more people. It is clear that the farmer ignored any veterinary advice on the disposal of this carcass. Its anthrax diagnosis is probably retrospective. At the time, lacking laboratory confirmation it would have been "suspect."

Livestock anthrax is enzootic in western Turkey and widespread. - Mod.MHJ
