Smuggled bushmeat poses disease risk to Britain, says report
--------------------------------------------------
At least 11 600 tons of illegal bush meat, including monkey, rat, bat,
gorilla, camel and elephant, were smuggled into Britain during 2003,
exposing cattle to a range of infectious diseases, including foot and mouth.
The extent of the illegal trade in meat from Africa, Asia and the Middle
East is revealed in an internal government report, which says that the
problem is far worse than had been thought.
Almost all of the meat, which is bound for street markets and ethnic
restaurants, is hidden in passengers' suitcases and goes undetected by
airport security. The food includes snake and antelope meat, frogs' legs,
snails, and cows' nostrils, as well as meat from endangered species such as
chimpanzees, antelopes and elephants. Some of it is infected and could
cause epidemics, according to the report from the Department of the
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).
The report reveals that the number of seizures of such illegal imports has
more than doubled from 7819 in the year to April 2003 to 15 838 for this
year [? January through April of each year], yielding 185 tons of
meat.[This might reflect increased policing efforts rather than increased
number of smugglings. - Mod.AS].
However, that represents less than one percent of the Government's estimate
of the illegal meat trade.
Opponents of the trade have accused the Government of not doing enough to
detect illegal meat at ports. They claim that it goes undetected because
there are only 6 meat-sniffer dogs in Britain. Machines costing BP 60 000
that can detect meat are available but none has been installed.
Work on assessing the risk to public health from the trade was carried out
by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency on behalf of Defra. It found that
while low, there was a risk to British livestock from the illegal imports.
It estimates that 580 lb of the smuggled meat every year is infected with
classical swine fever [virus], and that it was likely to cause an outbreak
every 3 years. It also estimates that up to 1245 lb of the bushmeat is
contaminated with foot and mouth, though it was likely to cause an outbreak
only every 65 years.
The report states: "The total amount of illegal meat entering Great Britain
each year is estimated on average to be 11 875 tonnes [11,687 tons].
"The top 5 contributors to the total flow are Eastern Asia, Near & Middle
East, Eastern Europe, Southern Africa, and Western Africa."
John Whittingdale, the shadow agriculture minister, said: "3 years on from
the world's worst outbreak of foot and mouth, the UK remains woefully
unprotected against the threat of human, animal and plant diseases entering
this country through the smuggling of illegal meat. While other countries
have installed stringent security measures, we have only 6 sniffer dogs
guarding all 110 ports of entry to the UK."
"We remain wide open to further risk of imported disease while a simple and
low-cost measure is available now which the Government is choosing to ignore."
The meat detection machines can "sniff" meat in luggage at the start of its
journey and send information to UK airports in time to seize the smugglers
as they try to enter the country.
Customs officials say that they have established 4 new anti-smuggling
teams. Defra has promised that the number of meat detection dogs and
handlers will be increased to 10 by April 2005. This will still compare
poorly with the efforts of other countries. Australia, for example, has
recently increased its number of detector dog teams from 33 to 48.
The consumption of bushmeat, which used to be confined to Africa, Asia and
South America, is now on the rise in restaurants across Europe,
particularly in London and Brussels. Its import is alarming because of
anecdotal evidence that it carries the risk of HIV infection.
According to the Bushmeat Crisis Task Force, a non-governmental
organisation that monitors the trade, SIV infection, the primate equivalent
of HIV, has now been reported in 26 species of African non-human primates,
many of which are hunted and sold as food. Contact with wild meat can also
increase the risk of ebola.
The International Fund for Animal Welfare says that the increase in hunting
for the bushmeat trade also threatens the livelihood of millions of people
living in forest communities who depend on wild meat for food.
