[The 23 new confirmed and 1249 suspected cases (up from 1168 suspected cases in the previous report) indicate that Lassa fever virus transmission is continuing as Nigeria is now in the period of the year when more cases usually occur as illustrated in the graph in Figure 3. There are 83 confirmed deaths, up from 75 in the previous reporting period. Unfortunately, 2 new healthcare workers in Edo state, were infected during this reporting period. This outbreak remains widespread so far in 2019, with confirmed cases occurring in 21 states and 66 LGAs [local government areas] (up from 57 in the previous reporting period).

Transmission of Lassa virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir hosts' excreta or are within healthcare facilities. It would be interesting to know whether the prevalence of Lassa fever virus has been increasing in populations of rodent hosts in areas where human cases are occurring.

The maps and graphs in the report above are interesting and provide a good picture of how the outbreak has progressed over time. - Mod.TY
