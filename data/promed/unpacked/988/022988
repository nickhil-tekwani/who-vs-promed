Venezuela: 20 Measles Cases Confirmed by the Ministry of Health
-----------------------------------------------
Mr. Francisco Armada of The Ministry of Health and Social Development
(MSDS, according to its Spanish initials) reported that measles cases
within Venezuela are under control and that up to now, 20 sick persons have
been reported in the Capital District and in Miranda State. No deaths have
been reported.
After a case of measles in Venezuela was reported involving a young pilot
working for an international airline company who acquired the infection in
Europe, a vaccination campaign was started, prioritizing children between 6
months to 4 years old as well as the age group between 5 to 17 years old in
case they had not been immunized in the past.
According to MSDS figures, nearly 170 000 persons received the double viral
vaccine (Measles/Rubella), which is administered free of charge. From 9 Apr
to 31 May 2006, the Vaccination System for the Americas will be
implemented, aiming to eliminate measles virus circulation. It is expected
that 2 562 795 children between 6 months and 4 years old will be immunized,
together with children between 5 and 17 years old. Those persons who may
want to obtain information about this viral disease should call 0-800-8444526.

outbreak. In the absence of any significant increase in case numbers, no
further reports will be posted and the thread is now cut. - Mod.CP]
