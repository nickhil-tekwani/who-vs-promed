Bluetongue virus detected
--------------------------
Scotland's 1st case of bluetongue virus has been found today [28 Nov
2007] in a herd of cattle imported from Germany. One of 35 cattle
imported from a farm in Bremen has tested positive for the virus
following routine post import testing undertaken by the Animal Health
Agency on behalf of the Scottish Government. As the animal was
imported it does not affect Scotland's 'free area' status.

Movement restrictions have been imposed on the farm near
Kirkcudbright and the infected animal will be culled to minimise the
risk of disease spreading. An epidemiological investigation is taking
place to assess the situation.

This is an isolated case. The virus has not been confirmed in
Scotland nor is it circulating between susceptible animals. Vector
activity is low at this time of year and in the current temperatures.

Richard Lochhead, Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and Environment
said: "Although this is the kind of news that our farmers have been
dreading especially after a very challenging year, it is important to
bear in mind that, given the circumstances of this case, Scotland
continues to remain free of bluetongue disease. The facts are that we
are currently only talking of one imported animal that has tested
positive out of 35 that were imported and this case has arisen at a
time of year when the chances of the disease circulating are low.
Farmers will be hoping that this is a one off isolated case. Clearly,
it is in our livestock industry's strong interests that all farmers
think very carefully about where they choose to import animals."

The animal is one of 35 cattle that were imported from Germany. The
remaining 34 animals have tested negative for bluetongue virus.
Restrictions put in place on the affected premises are under the
Animal and Animal products (imports and exports) (Scotland)
Regulations 2007. This restricts animal movements on or off the farm.
Bluetongue is an insect-borne viral disease which affects all
ruminants, such as cattle, goat, deer, camelids, and, in particular,
sheep. It does not affect pigs, horses or humans. It is transmitted
by the movement of midges or by movements of infected animals if they
are subsequently bitten by midges carrying the disease. [It would
have been clearer, if the text said: "bitten by midges which are
capable of carrying the virus further." - Mod.AS]

Bluetongue is unusual in that the disease is only confirmed when
there is evidence that the virus is circulating between animals and
vectors in an area. The presence of Bluetongue virus will not be
confirmed in Scotland until there is sufficient evidence to show that
the virus is circulating.

Clinical signs in sheep may include: fever; swelling of the head and
neck; inflammation and ulceration of the mucous membrane of the
mouth, nose and eyelids; lameness; muscle degeneration and leaking of
blood or serum from blood vessels into the surrounding tissues;
haemorrhages in the skin and other tissues; respiratory signs such as
froth in the lungs and an inability to swallow; and a high mortality
rate. Sometimes, although it is rare, there may be some
discolouration and swelling of the tongue.

Bluetongue is a notifiable disease. If you suspect signs of any
notifiable disease, you must immediately notify your local Animal
Health office. All animal keepers are also reminded that they are
required to report imports of cattle and sheep from outwith the UK to
their local animal health office.

Under the EU Bluetongue Regulation, susceptible animals [meaning,
ruminants free of BTV antibodies. - Mod.AS] are permitted to move out
of Restricted Zones into Free Areas, provided an official
veterinarian of the exporting country certifies that all the
necessary conditions have been met. Importers also have a
responsibility only to import animals which comply with the rules and
to notify Animal Health in advance of the movement. Animals are also
permitted to move freely within the same zones established in each
country; i.e., from the German Protection Zone to the UK Protection Zone.

[This is the 3rd consignment of cattle with BTV-positive cases
imported into the UK during December 2007 from continental Europe.
The 1st one, 14 Dec 2007, came from Germany (Lower Saxony), arriving
in Middlesbrough, where one head was found BTV positive following the
arrival. The 2nd one (20 Dec 2007) was imported from the Netherlands,
arriving at Worcester, with positive heifers. The positive cow at
Middlesbrough was culled, similarly to the 20 heifers in Worcester.
It is expected that the same action will be undertaken in the current case.

According to the Dutch "Agrarisch Blad" of 28 Dec 2007 (reported by
<http://www.agd.nl/1043259/Nieuws/Artikel//105600/Algemeen/CV/Derk-Klein-Kranenberg.htm>
Derk Klein Kranenberg), the Dutch exporter (Vion) claimed that
requirements were adhered to but were differently interpreted on the
opposite sides of the channel. According to a spokesman of the Dutch
ministry of agriculture, the animals had been certified for transport
to the bluetongue Protection zone in Great Britain but owing to a
misunderstanding, the animals however ended up in the Surveillance Zone.

As communicated earlier (see ProMED-mail post number 20071222.4118),
a vector-free period for Bluetongue disease has been declared in the
UK from 20 Dec 2007, allowing relaxation of certain movement
restrictions in relation to the control of Bluetongue. This became
possible due to falling temperatures and declining midge counts,
reducing significantly the risk of disease spread. Defra claimed
that, "based on historical data," such a period of low vector
activity "may continue into March 2008, but this will be kept under
review with consideration of midge activity and weather conditions."

Declaration of a vector-free period gives the industry an opportunity
to move livestock, subject to pre-movement testing, out of the
Bluetongue restriction zones and into the free area. Such conditions
may become internationally, at least between EU member-states,
applicable exclusively during the winter months. These requirements
should be clear, meticulously adhered to, and traceable. - Mod.AS]
