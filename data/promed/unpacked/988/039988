Rare birds killed by deadly bug
---------------------------------
3 of the world's most endangered birds have been killed by a severe bout of
blood poisoning in New Zealand.
A deadly bug infected a group of kakapo parrots (_Strigops habroptilus_) on
the offshore islands of Codfish and Chalky. Before the infection, from a
lethal strain of soil bacteria, there were only 86 kakapo left in the country.
The Department of Conservation (DoC) has responded swiftly to the outbreak
by giving the remaining birds emergency antibiotic treatment. "The birds
have either ingested, or, have been infected in some way with the
erysipelas bacterium. It goes straight into the blood stream and causes
blood poisoning," says Paul Jansen, who leads the kakapo team at the DoC.
"The good news is that we know what it is, and we have the right tools in
place."
The 3 young female kakapo which died -- Aroha, Aurora and Vollie -- were
hatched in the summer of 2002.
They, and 16 other young birds, had just been transferred from the kakapo
stronghold of Codfish Island (Whenua Hou), an island right at the bottom of
New Zealand, to Chalky Island (Te Kakahu), in Fiordland.
Having found out what caused the birds' deaths, the DoC has swung into
action to give all the 24 kakapo remaining on Chalky Island life-saving
antibiotics, and, to check on the well-being of those living on Codfish Island.
"We are building pens on Chalky Island, and there is a team of people up
the hill at the moment bringing down the first 5 females. They will be
treated over the next 5 days and once they have done their course of
antibiotics, they will go back out again," says Mr. Jansen.
"We will take the 1st 5 in, and regardless of whether they show any
symptoms or not, we are going to treat the hell out of them."
The DoC had just finished juggling the kakapo, moving some juveniles to
Chalky Island and transferring 12 older birds back to Codfish Island.
"We will still be running a process of screening on Codfish Island to make
sure that that bug is not present in that population, [but] we have had
nobody exhibiting signs," Mr. Jansen says.
The DoC is unsure how the birds picked up the bacterium, but Mr. Jansen
says it could have happened during the transfer between the islands.
"There is a possibility that they picked up this bug on the path of the
transfer, in the handling process, off somebody's clothes, or, even off
their hands, because this is something that can actually inhabit humans as
well," adds Mr. Jansen.
Once, kakapo roamed mainland New Zealand from sea level to the mountains.
Now they are confined to New Zealand's offshore islands.
The aim of the kakapo transfers was to ensure that all the birds on Codfish
Island were the optimum age for mating in time for the next rimu mast, the
prolific production of seed that is a known trigger for kakapo breeding.
The last time there was a rimu mast, back in 2002, 24 kakapo chicks were
hatched, including the 3 which have just died. [A successful kakapo
breeding season is triggered by a "mast" year, when the rimu trees produce
large amounts of fruit. The adult birds eat the fruit before it is ripe,
and, just before they are ready to breed. The chicks later eat the seed
from the ripened fruit, and, can increase their weight to up to 2 kg in the
1st 4 months of life. A "mast" year will happen only every 3-5 years.]
The kakapo is a fat, green, musty-smelling nocturnal bird, which cannot
fly, but which can climb trees. The male's low mating boom -- writer
Douglas Adams called it the "heartbeat of the night" -- can be heard up to
5 km away.
The population dwindled to just 50 in the mid-1990s, but an intensive
conservation effort has boosted kakapo numbers in the past few years.
The New Zealand conservationists are hoping that their swift response will
help contain this latest setback. "We don't want to go too far back," says
Mr. Jansen. "We don't want to go back down to 50, that's for sure."

Rare bacteria kills kakapo
----------------------------
A postmortem and pathology tests on 2 of 3 rare kakapo that have died
recently confirm that they died of a soil-borne bacteria Erysipelas.
Massey University Vet Brett Gartrell confirmed that the cause of the death
of the first bird is Erysipelas - a reasonably rare bacteria carried in the
blood. It is found in the soil and is transferable between birds. It
affects a range of animals, including dogs, dolphins and lambs and is often
fatal with young animals. Dr Gartrell says concentrations of the bacteria
were found in the liver and spleen of the bird and would have resulted in a
quick death.
He says the bacteria can be tested for in the faeces and is treatable with
antibiotics. It is now up to the Department of Conservation to decide how
to treat the problem.
A postmortem and tests on a 3rd bird which arrived today should confirm
this diagnosis, he says.

[Septicaemic _Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae_ infection is seen worldwide in
domestic and wild avians. A variety of mammals are also affected, with
swine being the most economically important species. Infection in reptiles
and amphibians has also been reported. The organism has been isolated from
the surface slime on fish, which may serve as a source of infection for
other species. Humans usually become infected when the organism enters
through cuts in the skin. The disease in humans (erysipeloid) is most
common in people who handle infected tissues, such as veterinarians,
butchers, and fish handlers. Erysipeloid in humans may be a localized, or,
a septicemic, and, occasionally, fatal infection.
The causative agent, a facultatively anaerobic, extracellular bacterium, is
gram-positive, nonmotile, and does not form spores. Essentially, all
strains share at least one common antigen, as demonstrated by
cross-agglutination and cross-protection studies. 24 serotypes (designated
1-24) currently exist based on heat-stable antigens in addition to
nontypeable strains designated N. No correlation has been shown to exist
between the serotype, chemical structure, or biochemical pattern and the
manifestation of the septicemic, urticarial, or endocardial forms of
erysipelas.
Antibiotic resistance of _E rhusiopathiae_ has not been reported. The
antibiotic of choice is a rapid-acting penicillin such as potassium or
sodium penicillin. As soon as a presumptive diagnosis is made, penicillin
should be administered IM at 10 000 u/lb body wt simultaneously with a full
dose of erysipelas bacterin.
Vaccination will control erysipelas; both inactivated and live vaccines are
available, and are widely used in turkeys. Complete protection in
Australian Emus was provided by a commercial strain 2b vaccine; annual
vaccination of birds at 4 weeks, and again at 8 weeks, of age appeared to
control further outbreaks on farms, where the disease had previously
occurred. Vaccination appeared to protect for at least 12 months. (Swan &
Lindsey, Aust Vet J. 1998 May;76(5):325-7). - Mod.AS].
