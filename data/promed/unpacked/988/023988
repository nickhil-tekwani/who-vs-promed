Kenya: Rift Valley fever situation - WHO Update 2

As of Fri 12 Jan 2007, 220 suspected cases, including 82 deaths, of
Rift Valley Fever virus [infection] (case-fatality ratio 37.2

including 10 deaths have also been reported from Ijara district in
North Eastern Province. In neighbouring Coast Province, 15 cases and
12 deaths have been reported in Wajir district and 15 cases and 6
deaths in Tana River district.
The Kenyan Ministry of Health is coordinating a mulitsectoral
response in collaboration with the Ministry of Livestock and
Fisheries Development and with United Nations partners including FAO,
UNICEF and WFP, as well as with other non-governmental partners. The
International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies
(IFRC) and national societies from Finland, Germany and Japan are
also working with the Kenyan Red Cross to contain the disease.
The Kenyan Ministry of Health is carrying out clinical case
management, and Rift Valley Fever wards have been established in
Garissa Provincial Hospital as well as in Ijara district. Over 8000
animals have been vaccinated under the supervision of the Kenyan
Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries Development and FAO. Vector
control spraying, human and animal surveillance and social
mobilization activities are continuing.
Additional technical assistance is also being provided by an
international team from the Global Outbreak Alert and Response
Network (GOARN). An 11-member team from GOARN partner institutions,
and WHO (Country Office, Regional Office for Africa, and
Headquarters) is supporting the Ministry of Health, provincial and
district health authorities in implementing public health measures to
control the outbreak. GOARN partners include: a mobile laboratory
team and 2 epidemiologists from the Public Health Agency of Canada
(National Microbiology Laboratory, Canadian Science Centre for Human
and Animal Health, and Canadian Field Epidemiology Programme ), a
technical expert on Rift Valley Fever and a case management/infection
control expert from the National Institute of Communicable Diseases
(NICD) and Department of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious
Diseases, National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS) and the School of
Pathology of the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South
Africa, and a 2-3 member social mobilization team from the US Centers
for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) and WHO Centre for
Vulnerability Reduction, (WMC), Tunisia. WHO has also received offers
of further technical assistance from GOARN institutions.
CDC-Kenya is coordinating bilateral assistance from the US
Departments of Agriculture, Defense and Health and Human Services (HHS).
