China has announced it had killed nearly 400 000 chickens in the far northwest
of the country to control a fresh outbreak of bird flu.
The outbreak was discovered on 14 Jul 2006 in Aksu city, Xinjiang region, when
3045 chickens were found dead, the agriculture ministry said in a brief
statement on its website on Friday [21 Jul 2006]. Since then 356 976 chickens
have been killed as part of emergency measures to contain the outbreak,
according to the statement. "The epidemic is effectively under control," it
said. There was no mention of any concerns for people living in the area.
The outbreak is the 37th reported among poultry in China since October 2005.
Of the 19 people confirmed to have contracted the H5N1 virus in China, 12 have
died.

[It is good there is a relatively small number of new cases since the last
report in May. You can see a map of the 3 Sudanese states mentioned in this
report at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/sudan.pdf>.
It may just be my own impression; it may be underreporting; or it may be just
good luck, but spread of the disease in several African countries seems to be
limited as compared to Southeast Asia. This applies to Cameroon (one
outbreak), Djibouti (one), Ivory Coast (2), Niger (3), Burkina Faso (4), and
Sudan (9 outbreaks reported). Nigeria on the other hand reports 69
outbreaks. Even being mindful of the vagaries of underreporting and the
difficulties of obtaining an exact estimate of the spread of Avian Influenza
in Africa to date, it would certainly follow that now is the time for added
resources to support the development of enhanced surveillance in poultry and
veterinary infrastructural capacity. This time next year, we may not have
quite as convivial a situation as we do now. - Mod.PC]
