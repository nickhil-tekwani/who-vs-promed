Nine new strains of clubroot [of] canola have been discovered in Western Canada. [This] shows how important it is to build a multi-pronged strategy for protecting crops, not relying solely on canola bred to resist the disease, said University of Alberta's Keisha Hollman. The new pathogens in canola across Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba [found] in 2017 and 2018 mean resistance breakdown, first discovered in 2013 [ProMED post 20150618.3447106], is growing.

The research brings the number of known clubroot pathotypes to 36, of which 19 can overcome the resistance to clubroot found in most canola varieties grown in Canada. "It shows how diverse the virulence of the pathogen is, and that this is going to continue to be a problem," said Hollman. Multiple strains of clubroot can occur in a field at any given time, so can overtake the pathotype that canola was originally bred to resist. "There's a new dominant pathotype in the field, which 1st-generation resistance can't control. It can take a decade to develop new clubroot-resistant canola plants," Hollman added.

Management plans could include longer [crop] rotations, sanitizing equipment between fields, and application of soil amendments to discourage clubroot development. A study showed that after a 2-year break from canola, the number of clubroot spores decreased by about 90% in soil. Research identified where particular new strains are popping up, whether they were spreading rapidly and why. "A lot of the new pathotypes were isolated, [and] we hope to keep them from spreading," Hollman said.

The identification of the new pathotypes also helps focus breeding towards the most dominant pathotypes.

[Clubroot of Brassicaceae is caused by the fungus-like organism _Plasmodiophora brassicae_. It is a destructive, soil-borne disease affecting nearly all cultivated members of the family, including oilseed rape (_Brassica napus_; "canola" refers to a group of specific varieties), cabbages, and turnips, as well as many wild species which may serve as pathogen reservoirs. It is found worldwide and is most damaging in temperate regions and tropical highlands.

The pathogen enters through root hairs and wounded roots. It multiplies rapidly, causing abnormal enlargement of the underground stem, taproot, or secondary roots ("clubs"). Affected roots often decay before the crop has matured. Depending on the timing of infection in the crop cycle, symptoms may include wilting, stunting, and yellowing of plants, or premature ripening resulting in shriveled seeds. Due to the distortion of the roots, plants may wilt in dry weather and then recover at night.

Decaying roots release many resting spores, which can survive in the soil for a decade or more in the absence of a susceptible host plant. The disease can be spread with soil (for example on agricultural machinery), farming activities, and infected plant debris. Use of clean planting material and phytosanitary measures to prevent spread between fields is essential. Disease management is difficult due to the longevity of the spores and the inaccessibility of underground plant parts to fungicides. Raising soil pH by addition of lime and experimental fumigation treatments have been shown to be effective (see ProMED post 20120521.1139354).

The species is composed of numerous pathotypes, which makes breeding crop cultivars with durable resistance difficult. It is therefore important to use multiple approaches to disease management simultaneously to counteract pathogen adaptation and extend the useful duration of both host resistances and effectiveness of fungicides.

In Canada, host resistance breakdown to pathotype 5X has been reported previously from Alberta (ProMED post 20180503.5780419).
