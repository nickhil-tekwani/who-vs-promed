Summary:

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major source of morbidity and mortality in the United States. HCV is transmitted primarily through parenteral exposures to infectious blood or body fluids that contain blood, most commonly through injection drug use. No vaccine against hepatitis C exists, and no effective pre- or postexposure prophylaxis is available. More than half of persons who become infected with HCV will develop chronic infection. Direct-acting antiviral treatment can result in a virologic cure in most persons with 8-12 weeks of all-oral medication regimens. This report augments (i.e., updates and summarizes) previously published recommendations from CDC regarding testing for HCV infection in the United States (Smith BD, Morgan RL, Beckett GA, et al. Recommendations for the identification of chronic hepatitis C virus infection among persons born during 1945-1965. MMWR Recomm Rec 2012; 61(RR-4)). CDC is augmenting previous guidance with 2 new recommendations: (1) hepatitis C screening at least once in a lifetime for all adults aged greater than or equal to18 years, except in settings where the prevalence of HCV infection is less than 0.1%, and (2) hepatitis C screening for all pregnant women during each pregnancy, except in settings where the prevalence of HCV infection is less than 0.1%. The recommendation for HCV testing that remains unchanged is regardless of age or setting prevalence; all persons with risk factors should be tested for hepatitis C with periodic testing while risk factors persist. Any person who requests hepatitis C testing should receive it, regardless of disclosure of risk, because many persons might be reluctant to disclose stigmatizing risks.

The up-to-date recommendations now are as follows:

Universal hepatitis C screening:
- Hepatitis C screening at least once in a lifetime for all adults aged greater than or equal to18 years, except in settings where the prevalence of HCV infection (HCV RNA-positivity) is less than 0.1%
- Hepatitis C screening for all pregnant women during each pregnancy, except in settings where the prevalence of HCV infection (HCV RNA-positivity) is less than 0.1%

One-time hepatitis C testing regardless of age or setting prevalence among persons with recognized risk factors or exposures:
- Persons with HIV
- Persons who ever injected drugs and shared needles, syringes, or other drug preparation equipment, including those who injected once or a few times many years ago
- Persons with selected medical conditions, including persons who ever received maintenance hemodialysis and persons with persistently abnormal ALT levels
- Prior recipients of transfusions or organ transplants, including persons who received clotting factor concentrates produced before 1987, persons who received a transfusion of blood or blood components before July 1992, persons who received an organ transplant before July 1992, and persons who were notified that they received blood from a donor who later tested positive for HCV infection.
- Health care, emergency medical, and public safety personnel after needle sticks, sharps, or mucosal exposures to HCV-positive blood
- Children born to mothers with HCV infection

Routine periodic testing for persons with ongoing risk factors, while risk factors persist:
- Persons who currently inject drugs and share needles, syringes, or other drug preparation equipment
- Persons with selected medical conditions, including persons who ever received maintenance hemodialysis

Any person who requests hepatitis C testing should receive it, regardless of disclosure of risk, because many persons might be reluctant to disclose stigmatizing risks
