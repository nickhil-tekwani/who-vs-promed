Some 100 residents of Kampung Baru Sungkap Para have come down with a
mysterious illness in the past few months. Besides fever, they say they
suffer from pain in the joints and a rash all over their bodies. Some
complain of loss of appetite as well.

The remaining 500 people in the village are beginning to worry as more
people are stricken, and no one seems to know what the problem is or its
cause. A woman said her rubber tapper husband had been sick for the past 3
months. He was admitted to the hospital in October [2008] but discharged
after 3 days. He still has joint pains while she and their 2 children have
also been ill. She said the hospital did not give them a diagnosis.

Another villager said health department officers had been coming to the
village often to fog against mosquitoes. Its director, Datuk Dr Hasnah
Ismail, said some of the villagers could be afflicted by chikungunya [virus
infection].

In a statement yesterday [12 Dec 2008], Datuk Dr Hasnah Ismail said 84
villagers from 15 houses had been checked, "16 were found to have fever,
joint pains and headaches, 8 have been admitted to Sultan Abdul Halim
Hospital for further treatment. We suspect the villagers who were admitted
might have chikungunya [virus]." She said the Health Department would fog
the village and perform checks on all the villagers.

[Chikungunya virus infections have been reported previously this year
(2008) in 5 Malaysian states: Johor, Melaka, Perak, Penang, and Sarawak.
The most recent cases occurred in August 2008, and the outbreak was moving
northward. The suspected cases in this report were in Kedah state in the
far north west of the country, and the report indicates that the outbreak
has been going on for at least 2 months.
