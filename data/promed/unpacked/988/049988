[Re: PRO/MBDS: Chikungunya - Thailand, Malaysia: RFI MBDS 20081025.3367]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Department of Disease Control of the Thai Ministry of Public
Health (MOPH) has released the information on the chikungunya
outbreak to the news media during the last 2 weeks. In summary, we
confirmed the outbreak of chikungunya in one village of Narathiwat
province by HI (hemagglutination inhibition) and PCR (polymerase
chain reaction) from [the serum of almost] 40 patients. PCR conducted
on a pool of _Aedes albopictus_ caught in the affected village was
also positive for chikungunya virus.

The major clinical symptoms seen are fever, rash, and persistent
polyarthralgia with arthritis. The affected population is [more than]
80 people. We have alerted the nearby province and have received
information on some more similar cases from a nearby area. The total
number of reported cases is now almost 200 cases. The vector control
and education program for villagers are going on. We have shared
information on this outbreak with SEARO (SouthEast Asian Regional
Office of the World Health Organization) and all the MBDS countries as well.
