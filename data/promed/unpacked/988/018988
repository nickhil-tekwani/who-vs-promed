There has been an increase in listeriosis cases in Ontario this year
[2010], and 2 people have died, the provincial health ministry
announced Friday [12 Mar 2010].

On average, Ontario expects to see an average of 40 reported cases of
listeriosis per year, and about 8 by March. Between 1 Jan and 11 Mar
this year [2010], there have been 14 reported cases, said Dr. Arlene
King, Ontario's chief medical officer. "There is a strong network of
federal and provincial agencies that are working diligently to
minimize the risk of any more incidents of this food-borne illness.
We will keep the public informed of any new developments in our
investigation," said King.

So far, only 10 of the 14 reported cases have been investigated.
Aside from the 2 deaths, 7 people were hospitalized. At least 2 of
the non-fatal cases have been linked to recently recalled ham and
salami products from Toronto-based company Siena Foods. Both of those
patients are from Toronto. They were both hospitalized but are now
recovering.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency [CFIA] is warning consumers that
Siena-brand Prosciutto Cotto Cooked Ham products may have been
contaminated with the bacteria _Listeria monocytogenes_. These
products would have been sold to consumers after 11 Jan [2010] in
delicatessens, and grocery and specialty food stores in Ontario,
Quebec and Alberta. King is also warning people not to consume
Siena-brand mild Cacciatore Salami, which was recalled in December
2009 and may be linked to the recent rash of illnesses. Siena Foods
is voluntarily recalling the affected food while the CFIA
investigates the outbreak. Siena hasn't halted all production at its
plant. However, only products that test negative for _Listeria_ will
be delivered to the public.

Consumers who fear they may have consumed the tainted food are urged
to contact their local retailers. The ham would have been sold in
large wholesale packages, with best before dates of 8 Mar and 22 Mar
2010. The salami would have a best before date of 4 May 2010.

Food contaminated with _Listeria_ may not appear spoiled in any way.
Symptoms include high fever, severe headache, neck stiffness and
nausea. "Listeriosis is, in most cases, a mild and self-limiting
disease," said King. However, pregnant women, the elderly, or people
with weak immune systems are at a greater risk of death because the
infection can lead to blood poisoning or meningitis, King said.
Pregnant women who consume contaminated foods may experience
premature delivery, spontaneous abortion, or stillbirth. As well, the
infection can be passed along to the newborn. King went so far as to
recommend people in the high-risk category avoid all deli meats and
unpasteurized dairy products -- not just those being recalled -- at
all times. "There is an inherent risk of bacteria in all of those
kinds of products," King said.

22 people in Canada died of listeriosis in 2009. The 2009 outbreak
prompted Prime Minister Stephen Harper to assign Sheila Weatherill,
former head of Edmonton's health system, to issue an independent
report about the situation and make recommendations on how to avoid
similar outbreaks in the future. Robert Charlebois, executive
director of food safety and consumer protection with the CIFA, was
unable to say how many of Weatherhill's 57 recommendations have been
implemented. "Certainly, we have learned from the previous
listeriosis cases and the recommendations. We have implemented quite
a bit of the recommendations, and we have accepted all the
recommendations," he said. "We are implementing as we speak."

[It is not stated in the news release above whether listeria was
isolated at the processing plant or from the Siena-brand deli meats
(ham and salami), or whether DNA fingerprinting of any strains of
listeria that were isolated from the patients or deli meats was done
and whether the DNA fingerprints proved to be identical. The news
release above also does not pinpoint how the contamination occurred
during the production process.

In 2008, ProMED reported a Canadian deli-meat associated outbreak of
listeriosis that involved 20 deaths (Listeriosis, fatal, meat product
- Canada (04) 20081005.3147). The _Listeria_ bacterium was found deep
inside slicing equipment, according to company officials at Maple
Leaf Foods plant, Canada's biggest food company.

The following is extracted from Mod.ML's comments in ProMED-mail post
Listeriosis, fatal - Chile: (Santiago) meat susp, RFI 20090411.1391:

"_Listeria monocytogenes_, the cause of listeriosis, is widely
distributed in nature. The organism can be found in soil, water,
silage, raw vegetables, raw meat and poultry, raw and pasteurized
milk, soft cheeses, kitchen premises, and in the intestinal tract of
many animals, including cattle, sheep, and humans, and in
crustaceans, fish, shellfish, ticks, and insects.

Most human infections are food-borne, although vertical transmission
can occur from mother to fetus transplacentally or during delivery
through an infected birth canal, and localized skin infections can
occur in veterinarians and farmers by direct contact with infected
animals.

Contamination of food can occur in nature, such as, raw vegetables
contaminated by soil and manure, and raw milk from infected cows; or
contamination may occur following subsequent cooking or other
processing. Because the organisms can multiply at refrigerator
temperatures, it is not surprising that listeriosis is usually
associated with ingestion of contaminated milk, meat or vegetable
products that have been held at refrigeration temperatures." Since
listeria in raw food would be killed during cooking, the risk of
listeriosis is usually greatest from ready-to-eat products, that is,
food that will not be further cooked before eating. Listeriosis is
more severe in newborns, pregnant women, people 60 years of age or
older, and those with compromised immune defenses. A detailed
discussion of listeriosis can be found in ProMED-mail post
20071230.4186."
