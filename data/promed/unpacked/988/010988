A man has died of the 2nd case of wound botulism in 2 months in
Yakima County, and health officials believe both are linked to black
tar heroin.
The latest victim, 22, died Mon 28 May 2007, a week after being
diagnosed with botulism in the emergency room at Yakima Regional
Medical and Cardiac Center, Yakima Health District officials said. He
was homeless and had been living by the Yakima River, and health
officials were unable to locate relatives. The other case occurred in
March 2007, and the victim survived.
Wound botulism is caused by neurotoxins following an infection [often
quite innocent looking - Mod.LL] with _Clostridium botulinum_, a
bacterium whose spores sometimes can be found in black tar heroin
that is contaminated with soil and feces. Heating heroin before
injecting it doesn't necessarily [inactivate] the spores, which can
germinate into bacteria that produce toxin once in the body.
Marianne Patnode, communicable disease services coordinator, said the
county typically sees about 2 cases of wound botulism a year, but
they are rarely fatal.
Four drug users in Yakima County were treated for wound botulism in
2003. Like the one who died Mon 28 May 2007, they injected black tar
heroin under the skin surface. Those who inject heroin intravenously
or into the muscles appear to be at lower risk, said Dr. Christopher
Spitters, the county's health officer.

[Black tar heroin continues to be associated with clusters of wound
botulism, both in the USA and in Europe. This form of heroin is a
gummy black substance usually produced in makeshift factories, mostly
in Mexico, adjacent to opium poppy fields (1). It is generally
injected subcutaneously in a process referred to as skin popping. The
local area may be unremarkable or may be necrotic or abscess-forming.
The tarry nature of the drug has led to a number of diluents
("cutting" agents), which have been postulated to be the source of
the _Clostridium botulinum_ spores. In Passaro's study (1), the
development of wound botulism was not affected by cleaning the skin,
cleaning the injection paraphernalia or sharing needles.
Debridement of necrotic areas or drainage of abscesses are required
if such lesions are present. Respiratory support and antitoxin remain
the mainstays of treatment.
Yakima County, Washington, as noted, was the location for previous
clusters of cases (2; see ProMED posting "Botulism, wound,
drug-related - USA (WA)" 20060329.0953).
