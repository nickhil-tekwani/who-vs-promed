In the ICU at Northside Hospital in Atlanta, [Georgia,] the patient's husband sanitized his hands on Friday [27 Jul 2012], chatted with a nurse and looked over his unconscious wife. Thin and pretty, her brown hair swept into a high ponytail, she breathed through a tracheostomy tube, her lips parted. He pinched a white sheet covering his wife and lifted up.

The feet that had carried his wife on missionary trips to Mexico and Poland, where she developed an affinity for delicious perogies, were gone. The hands she used for gardening around the 1950s ranch they share in Decatur, [Georgia] for playing with their puppy, the finger for her wedding ring -- all of that was gone, too. Instead what Mark saw were 4 gauze-wrapped bulbs: the remainder after an unfathomable subtraction, the choice that had become the only option.

In his wife, a 32-year-old patient care technician at DeKalb [County] Medical Hillandale, a rare bacterial infection has struck again this summer, claiming another ambitious young woman's extremities. Oddly, his wife shares a South Gwinnett High School connection with Aimee Copeland, whose plight brought the term "flesh-eating bacteria" into the national lexicon, and whose name became synonymous with perseverance. Copeland graduated from the school; the patient's husband teaches math there. Both women have sacrificed much to microscopic villains born in strange places.

The husband catches himself wondering when he'll wake up from this, when he'll snap back to late June [2012], when he and his wife were pressure-washing their home, which is girded by Japanese maples. After a day sweating in the yard, his wife developed aches and a 103-degree fever. With an icy bath, the fever broke, and they shrugged the symptoms off. But by the time she, a cancer survivor, went to see her oncologist for a scheduled meeting, he had to carry her into Northside Hospital. She was admitted to the ICU on 2 Jul 2012 and hasn't left since.

For 2 weeks, his wife's family and friends were in limbo as doctors tried to root out the cause. Blood samples untainted by antibiotics were sent to a Mayo Clinic lab, where the culprit was finally revealed as _Capnocytophaga_, a bacterium found in the saliva of mammals, especially dogs. It almost never causes infections.

After much deduction the family feels certain the bacteria came from "Brownie," the couple's 1-year-old Labrador retriever mix, a rambunctious shelter rescue that uses its owners as chew toys. There was no specific bite on Hannah. No real blood. No wound.

On Thursday [26 Jul 2012] night, his wife joined an unfortunate sorority of amputees that includes Copeland, who contracted her bacteria, _Aeromonas hydrophila_, when a homemade zip line snapped 1 May 2012, sending her crashing into a river near the University of West Georgia, where she studied psychology. Copeland was gashed in the fall, and the infection would claim her leg, foot and both hands. Flesh-eating _Aeromonas_ cases are so rare that only a handful have been reported in medical journals in recent decades.

According to the LSU [Louisiana State University] School of Veterinary Medicine, most people who develop _Capnocytophaga_ infections were bitten by dogs, leading to septicemia, or blood poisoning. While the infection doesn't eat flesh, per se, about 30 percent of people who develop its septicemia die.

A 2006 study by the California Department of Health Services found that co-existing conditions in _Capnocytophaga_ patients can include Hodgkin lymphoma, which the patient developed at age 18. Other studies have found that more than 40 percent of patients have no obvious risk factor. 4 years ago, Swiss doctors counted only 160 reported infections since the bacteria's discovery in 1976.

Levophed (vasoconstrictor) has been taken off his wife's IV, and replaced with Precedex (painkiller). Septic shock took its toll. Blood was clotting en route to his wife's feet and hands, where tissue had become necrotic, releasing toxins into her blood that could take her life. In the end, his wife lost her hands up to the forearms, her legs from 15 centimeters below the knee, the standard length for prosthetics. But all the necrotic tissue is gone.

[_Capnocytophaga canimorsus_, a Gram-negative bacillus (rod-shaped) previously classified as CDC Group Dysgonic Fermenter-2 (DF-2), is a slow-growing bacterium that requires carbon dioxide for growth. This organism has been isolated from the saliva of healthy dogs and cats as a component of the normal flora. In most (77 percent) human cases, infection with this organism is preceded by a bite or other exposure to dogs; Since 1961, 200 human isolates of _C. canimorsus_ have been sent to CDC for identification (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00019514.htm).

This organism causes self-limiting cellulitis following a dog or cat bite that can progress rapidly to fulminant sepsis, septic shock, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), with a case-fatality rate of 25 percent. Necrotizing fasciitis has been rarely described as a consequence of _C. canimorsus_ infection. Most fatal infections have occurred in persons with a history of asplenia, alcoholism, or hematologic malignancy. This organism is susceptible to many antibiotics (e.g., penicillin, amoxicillin, erythromycin, tetracycline, cefoxitin, and clindamycin). Empiric antibiotic treatment has been recommended for this bacterium following an animal bite in these high-risk patient populations.

A "flesh-eating" infection, i.e., necrotizing fasciitis, was not described in the patient in the above news report. Most likely the loss of her distal extremities was a consequence of DIC. Gangrene of the extremities, as well as gangrene of skin, the tip of the nose and ears can be a consequence of sepsis, septic shock and DIC. For example, septicemic plague, meningococcemia, and pneumococcal sepsis can cause peripheral gangrene. In addition, gangrene of the extremities can occur as a consequence of the duration and amount of vasopressive drug support of the blood pressure, which she received. The above news report also fails to say if this patient had a spleen. Patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma at one time underwent splenectomy to determine the extent of the lymphoma.

Decatur, a suburb of Atlanta, is the county seat of DeKalb County, Georgia, with a population of 19 335 in the 2010 census (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decatur,_Georgia).
