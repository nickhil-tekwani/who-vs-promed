It has fallen to me to respond to some of the comments about the recent
'outbreak' of canine leptospirosis (see the recent media release attached).
Some history for our learned colleagues not covered in the report:
1. The outbreak is probably due to _Leptospiria copenhagi_.
2. This is a very restricted outbreak involving one small area of green
belt on the outskirts of Sydney. Thus far about 12 dogs have been
clinically affected and several have died.
3. Some high titers to _L. copenhagi_ were found in two dogs which
subsequently died.
4. Outbreaks occur in this same locality every 10 years or so, seemingly in
autumn - 2000, 1990, mid 1980s, 1973.
5. Epidemiologically it would seem to indicate a wildlife reservoir such as
rodents and/or bandicoots contaminating surface water with infected urine.
The autumn we are having was mild and wet. We know leptospires survive
outside the host in the dry summer for about half an hour, and they are
susceptible to frost - so the only opportunity for their survival for an
extended time is during a damp warm autumn, such as recently experienced -
it is rapidly passing. The organisms are also susceptible to slightly
acidic conditions, so soil pH is important (it survives in a narrow range
of pH 6.5-8.5). The affected dogs are on greyhound farms with surface water
because it has been raining, or free ranging dogs on acreage - both types
of which have access to surface water for the occasional drinking at their
own leisure. Additionally, it would be expected that infectious aerosols,
generated by dogs splashing through surface water could be inhaled. Whether
there is also some capture and eating of infected rodents or not is
unknown, but I think there is probably enough to go on without that.
6. The icterohaemorrhagica vaccine currently available in Australia should
offer good protection.
7. At the time of the media release, there were no confirmed human cases
associated with this outbreak.
8. We thought it a wise precaution to alert residents and dog owners in
other areas with similar environmental conditions, but thus far have not
had any suspect cases reported.
9. Leptospirosis is a disease with zoonotic potential but animal
leptospirosis is not listed as a notifiable disease under the stock
diseases act of NSW. However, NSW agriculture is alerted by concerned
colleagues of significant events such as this. There is a mechanism whereby
if a disease is considered of sufficient importance and a sound case can be
made to justify further investigations, the chief veterinary officer for
the state can request further investigations under targeted surveillance as
a new and emerging disease.
10. Human leptospirosis is included in the national notifiable diseases
surveillance system. But I do not know if any of the involved human medical
practices and human medical laboratories in the area are concerned.
11. For an official response to the position of the Australian Quarantine
and inspection service on the justification and details of the tests
currently required for the importation of dogs into Australia from the USA
with regards to leptospirosis you would need to refer to a relevant
spokesperson such as: David.Buckley@aqis.gov.au
12. I have no information on the supposed recent outbreak of _L.australis_
in dogs near Mackie, North Coastal Queensland, in late 1999.
If there is anything else I can add to clarify this issue, please contact me.
