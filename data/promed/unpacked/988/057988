[Bluetongue is regarded endemic in Israel since its initial
laboratory-confirmed identification in 1951, with clinical disease
seen almost every year. It is strictly seasonal and has been known,
until recently, to affect almost exclusively sheep (of susceptible
breeds). All clinically suspected cases are obligatorily
laboratory-confirmed. 5 serotypes have been identified in Israel
between 1951 and 1973, namely BTV-4 (1951), BTV-16 (1968), BTV-6
(1972), BTV-2 (1973), and BTV-10 (1973). BTV-4 has been, throughout
these years, the most prevalent serotype.

Then, after 32 years of a seemingly stable situation, a new strain
appeared, namely BTV-15 (2006), which affected sheep. This was
followed by the detection of 3 other newly introduced BTV strains
which -- rather surprisingly -- affected clinically cattle as well:
BTV-24 (2008), BTV-8 (2008, eventually identified early 2009), and now
BTV-5. BTV-5 has become Israel's 9th BTV serotype.

This means that 4 orbiviruses which affect cattle have been identified
for the 1st time in Israel since 2006: EHD (serotype 7), in late
summer/fall of 2006; BTV-8 in November 2008; BTV-24, in November 2008
and again in March-April 2009; and now, BTV-5. BTV-8 and BTV-24 are
also serious sheep pathogens, with BTV-24 demonstrating, at least in
one case, exceptionally high pathogenicity in susceptible sheep. The
pathogenicity of BTV-8 in cattle seems more serious than BTV-24.

We have noted from the Israeli Veterinary Services, that -- besides
the 2 outbreaks of BTV-5 in northern Israel, reported in the above
immediate notification -- additional outbreaks have been diagnosed
during the current BTV season (traditionally extending from July to
December, peaking in October-November), all of them in the south.
These are 3 outbreaks of BTV-4, 2 of them in sheep and one in sheep
and cattle (!); 3 outbreaks of BTV-24, 2 affecting sheep and one in
sheep and cattle. There was also one outbreak caused by BTV-8 in
sheep. Altogether, 4 serotypes are circulating at present in Israel,
one in the north (BTV-5) and 3 in the south (BTV-4,8 and 24). It may
be assumed that this situation is not restricted, in the regional
context, to Israel.

No vaccines against serotypes 5, 8, 15 or 24 are available in Israel.
