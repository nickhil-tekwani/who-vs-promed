Marburg virus confirmed
----------------------------------
The Ministry of Health has dispatched an emergency response team to
Kitaka in Kamwenge district, some 250 km [155.34 miles] west of
Kampala, where at least 2 cases of Marburg haemorrhagic fever have
been confirmed.
Health minister Dr. Stephen Malinga has also travelled to the region
to ascertain the outbreak of the deadly virus, which is similar to
Ebola. Both cases, of whom one died, were gold miners in a
privately-owned mine situated in Kakasi Forest Reserve in Kamwenge district.
"Samples we sent to Atlanta US have confirmed Marburg disease," the
director general of health services, Dr. Sam Zaramba, told The New
Vision. "A team of experts is on its way to reinforce the district
team already on the ground. We also intend to close down the mine
until it is deemed safe."
The team, led by Dr. Julius Lutwama of the Uganda Virus Institute,
consists of scientists from Makerere University Institute of Public
Health, the Ministry of Health and the World Health Organisation. One
of the tasks of the team, Zaramba explained, was to track down,
isolate and monitor all persons who had come in close contact with
the 2 victims.
"We have contacted the mine-owners and are tracking all workers and
people who could have looked after the victims or come into direct
physical contact with them. With or without symptoms, we are going to
take their blood samples for testing," he said, adding: "Because the
Marburg disease is rare, when you get one case, it immediately
becomes an epidemic."
He called on the public to remain calm, arguing that the infection
rate of Marburg was far lower than that of Ebola. He also noted that
if no additional cases were reported within 21 days of the outbreak,
the epidemic would be declared over. The 2 victims fell sick 2 weeks
ago, leaving one more week to go.
"The 1st outbreak was reported in Germany in the 1960s, the 2nd was
in South Africa in the 1970s, followed by Uganda, where 19 people
from one family in Kamuli died in 1977. Another outbreak was in Kenya
in the 1980s," he explained.
According to records of the Ministry of Health, the latest Marburg
outbreak was in 1999 in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where at
least 52 people died, mainly gold miners in the remote northeastern
part of the country [The most recent Marburg outbreak was in Angola
in 2004/2005. See prior ProMED-mail postings listed below for more
information. - Mod.MPP].
The Minister of State for Health, Dr. Richard Nduhuura, briefed
Parliament yesterday about the measures taken by the government to
contain the spread. He said more blood samples from the survivor
would be taken and sent to the US for research.
He also told MPs that a separate cabinet team, headed by
vice-president Prof. Gilbert Bukenya, had mapped out a national
strategy on how to curb the outbreak. He later told the press that
literature about the disease would be given to members of Parliament
to sensitise their constituents, in addition to efforts of the health teams.
The Marburg fever, which causes death within 48 hours, is thought to
reside in monkeys and spread by bats and rats. Like Ebola, it does
not respond to treatment. Its symptoms include high fever, headache,
vomiting and bleeding from the gums and skin.
Even in the best hospitals, the virus can be expected to kill up to a
quarter of the people who get infected with it. It is extremely rare
and, for that reason, researchers will want to find out as much as
possible about this latest outbreak.
The virus is named after the North German town of Marburg, where a
laboratory worker, who was taking blood from Ugandan monkeys, became
ill and died in 1967.

Uganda on alert as deadly Marburg Hemorrhagic Fever breaks out
---------------------------------------
Health experts in Uganda are on high alert and ready to counter the
spread of the highly deadly and contagious Marburg Hemorrhagic Fever
(MHF) that has been confirmed in the western part of the country.
Richard Nduhuura, the minister of state for health told parliament on
Wednesday [1 Aug 2007] that the ministry in collaboration with
international health experts has already dispatched a rapid response
team to Kamwenge District, 250 km [155.34 miles] west of Kampala,
where the 1st case of the viral disease was recorded.
Health officials on Wednesday [1 Aug 2007] confirmed the 2 cases of
MHF at Kitaka Gold mine, located in Kakasi Forest Reserve in Kamwenge
District, where a miner died of the disease on [14 Jul 2007].
Marburg, like Ebola, is characterized by sudden bleeding and high
fever, resulting into death within a week normally. Transmission is
through close contact with blood and other body fluids from patients
with clinical signs. It can also be transmitted following exposure to
contaminated items, such as bedding and clothing of patients.
In 1977, 19 cases were reported in Bugiri District, eastern Uganda.
Minister Nduhuura who later addressed a press briefing at the
ministry headquarters said the mine has been closed and those
possibly exposed to the virus have been isolated for observation.
"Blood samples are being collected from all the miners and their
contacts are being screened locally and at international
collaborating centers including Center for Disease Control in Atlanta
Georgia, USA," the minister said, flanked by Melville George, World
Health Organization Representative in Uganda.
He said no new cases of the disease have been reported in the last 15
days and after the lapse of 21 days, it can be asserted that the
disease is contained. He noted that given the country's experience in
containing similar outbreaks, the disease will be contained.
According to the WHO, the last 2 recent outbreak of MHF in the
Democratic Republic of Congo during 1998-2000 and in Angola during
2004-2005 have claimed 128 and 323 lives respectively.

Communicated by:
ProMED-mail Rapporteur Joseph Dudley
[According to the 2 newswires, confirmation of Marburg virus
infection in the 2 miners was done by the United States Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention laboratories in Atlanta GA. The
articles mention the date of death of one of the cases as 14 Jul
2007, 17 days ago, with reference that an outbreak is considered over
if 21 days have passed without new cases. The criteria usually
applied for declaring an outbreak over is for 2 incubation periods to
have passed without the occurrence of new cases. If past history is
any indicator, caution should be exerted here until results of
follow-up on contacts are known. In prior outbreak of viral
hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) in Africa, the occurrence of cases leads to
panic, and contacts frequently leave the area defined to them as at
risk, oftentimes having had exposure, and returning to their distant
villages while still incubating the infection. Secondary cases then
occur in these villages on the part of family members that care for
the cases, and where fatalities occur, among those individuals who
prepare the bodies for burial. Both care of ill individuals and
preparation of bodies of deceased for burial involve close contact
with infected bodily fluids. In addition, when these individuals have
been ill, they often seek assistance from a local health facility
that is oftentimes poorly equipped to permit use of universal
precautions, and these local health facilities become locales that
potentiate nosocomial transmission of the virus.
That being said, this moderator doesn't wish to appear as a gloomy
predictor, but rather is exerting caution in giving an "all is clear"
message. One hopes that these 2 cases will end up as sporadic cases
and not part of a larger outbreak as seen in Angola in 2004/2005, and
in the outbreak of Ebola hemorrhagic fever seen in Uganda in 2000/2001.
