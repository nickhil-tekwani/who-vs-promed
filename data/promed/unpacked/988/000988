The death of a macaw purchased from a pet shop in Largs, Ayrshire,
Scotland, and subsequent preliminary finding of psittacosis infection, have
triggered an alert on the disease. Ten people, including pet shop staff and
friends and relatives of the owner, have given blood samples to see if they
have contracted the disease.
The bird was supplied by breeders Wings and Things of Stoneburn Farm,
Forestfield, Caldercruix, Lanarkshire. Largs shop boss Stuart Sommerville
bought the macaw for himself and took it home. Within three days, the macaw
had fallen ill and died.
Stuart said: "The lab sent word back that it had the disease, which can be
transmitted in the air to people. I was told that everyone who had been in
the same room as the bird would have to be checked. It can cause a flu-like
virus, I was warned it could kill anyone with a weak heart who had been in
contact with it."
The North Lanarkshire Council said animal health officer John Gaffney was
monitoring the situation but that nothing more would be done until they had
full confirmation on the findings of a post mortem examination.
A spokesman said: "Once it is confirmed psittacosis is involved, we will go
out to the farm to take blood samples from the remaining stock."
He added that a second parrot which appeared to be sick had already been
removed from the premises to be tested. The pet shop owner is working with
a private vet to minimize further risk.
A number of other pets in the same consignment, including five hamsters,
two guinea pigs and a cockatiel, all died after they were delivered. The
rest of the birds and animals were for a branch of the family business in
Dunoon, across the [river] Clyde.

[Shades of Monte Python. I can still remember the first case I ever saw, a
very dead pigeon, when I was a veterinary student doing a month's
laboratory practice at the VIC-Reading. I was not allowed near it. An
extremely infectious disease. Presumably the breeders' establishment was
infected, and where did they get it from?. - Mod.MHJ]
