Plant's Sanitation May Have Link to Deadly Bacteria
--------------------------------------------------
A Federal meat inspector said a Pennsylvania poultry plant, 1 of 2
operations under investigation as a likely source of a listeria
outbreak that has killed 8 people since July 2002, had persistent
sanitation problems that could have fostered the bacteria. But the
inspector, Vincent Erthal, said inspection officials had failed to
crack down on some of the problems in part because of what he and
other critics see as confusion and indecision in a new federal system
for regulating the nation's food companies.
Mr. Erthal said in interviews that the chief government inspector at
the Wampler Foods plant in Franconia, PA, USA, disagreed about the
extent of the dangers and opposed his efforts to force a cleanup in
the fall of 2001, about 8 months before the outbreak, which also
sickened 54 people in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut,
Pennsylvania, and 5 other states. Mr. Erthal also said that as health
authorities issued the first alerts about the outbreak in late August
2002, he and a supervisor recommended that top regional inspection
officials consider forcing the Wampler plant to close for repairs.
But, he said, little was done until 6 weeks later.
Several Agriculture Department officials said sanitation problems,
including mold and algae on the walls and condensation dripping from
ductwork over the processing tables, were chronic enough to justify
closing the plant. The department ordered the plant closed
temporarily on 13 Oct 2002 after the strain of _Listeria
monocytogenes_ that caused the deaths was found in the plant's
drains. Wampler, a part of Pilgrim's Pride, the nation's
second-largest poultry company, also recalled 27 million pounds of
meat, one of the largest amounts in American history, and later
reopened on 13 Nov 2002.
The Agriculture Department's Inspector General and Democrats in
Congress are investigating why nothing more was done before listeria
was found in the drains. Both the government and Wampler officials
said none of the meat returned under the recall had tested positive
for the same rare strain of _L. monocytogenes_ that caused the
outbreak. They also said there was no proof that anyone had been
sickened by Wampler's turkey deli meats and other ready-to-eat
products.
Identical bacteria have been found in turkey processed by an
unrelated company, J. L. Foods Co. Inc., in Camden, NJ, and health
officials say it remains unclear how most of the victims became ill.
Still, food-safety experts say Mr. Erthal's complaints raise new
questions about the Agriculture Department's inspection and
bacteria-testing program, which has come under scrutiny as a result
of huge recalls of contaminated beef and poultry at some of the
nation's largest processing companies since mid-July 2002. To safety
advocates, government auditors and some meat inspectors, the biggest
failures have come in how the department's Food Safety and Inspection
Service has implemented changes that grew out of a 1993 outbreak of
_E. coli_ O157:H7 at the Jack-in-the-Box hamburger chain.
Billed as revolutionary, the new approach was meant to be more
scientific than the "poke and sniff" methods that inspectors had used
since the turn-of-the-century days of Upton Sinclair's "The Jungle."
Because the worst hazards come from microscopic toxins, the idea was
to place more responsibility on the companies for proper
refrigeration and handling and to require them to create plans to
kill any germs. The program was phased in over several years, and
supporters credit it with helping to reduce the frequency of serious
food-borne illnesses from _E. coli_, _Salmonella_ and _L.
monocytogenes_, which caused the recent outbreak.
But surveys by the Agriculture Department's Inspector General and the
General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, show
that many plants have been allowed to get by with inadequate safety
plans.
Mr. Erthal, 40, who has been a meat inspector for 18 years, said the
new rules have "a lot of gray areas." He said inspectors were still
taught to step in quickly at any sign of direct contamination. But
when it comes to broader sanitation problems, he and others said,
many inspectors are waiting longer to intervene out of a sense that
it is now the company's role to deal with those issues unless there
are repeated failures. Rodney Leonard, a former administrator of the
inspection service, said the result is "a clear `don't ask, don't
tell' mandate" that is causing inspectors to miss "red flags all over
the place."
Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California and the
ranking minority member on the House Committee on Government Reform,
said, "I think what we're seeing is a picture of a department that
has abdicated its responsibility to protect the public in the area of
food safety." Dr. Elsa Murano, the Agriculture Department's under
secretary for food safety, disputed the criticism, saying she
expected her inspectors to be as aggressive as ever.
Department officials -- and Wampler executives -- said that if Mr.
Erthal, who was the night-shift inspector at Wampler from May 2000
until last September 2002, when he received a requested transfer to a
daytime assignment at another plant, was so worried about the
conditions, he should have taken harsher actions against the plant
himself or pushed harder to blow the whistle before the outbreak
occurred.
Dr. Murano said the recall at Wampler was a prime motivation for a
new listeria testing directive that went into effect on Mon, 9 Dec
2002. Under the plan, if companies that make ready-to-eat products
like hot dogs and deli meats do not voluntarily provide the
government with test results for even the most general, and least
harmful, types of bacteria in their plants, then the department will
expand its own testing. The agency is also working on a new rule to
require companies to test their processing areas for listeria, Dr.
Murano said, so "you can find it before it gets into the product."
Felicia Nestor, an official at the Government Accountability Project,
an advocacy group that has been helping Mr. Erthal and other
whistle-blowers, said, "The regulations focused on direct product
contamination, and it's only now that USDA is adding a focus on
environmental testing, which is an acknowledgment that they have left
consumers without adequate protection up till now." Dr. Murano said
that if the agency had known before the outbreak that Wampler's own
tests had detected the more general types of listeria in the plant,
"we would have acted."
Ron Morris, the senior vice president for turkey operations at
Pilgrim's Pride, said the company had shared its listeria testing
results, both positive and negative, with the government by placing
them in a file drawer with other records available to the inspectors.
But department officials said the inspector in charge, Debra Martin,
who declined to comment, has denied knowing anything about the
company's test results, and Mr. Erthal said he never saw the logs in
the drawer.
Still, Mr. Erthal said that over time company employees told him
informally that the tests were finding general types of listeria in
the plant. Experts say that many listeria [species] can be harmless,
but their presence can also signal that conditions are ripe for _L.
monocytogenes_, the deadly type.
Mr. Erthal said that when Ms. Martin walked around with him in his
first days at the plant, he pointed to the algae on the walls,
flaking paint, and condensation on air-conditioning ducts. But, he
said, Ms. Martin told him that under the new regulatory system, such
hazards were not a high priority unless they threatened to
contaminate meat directly. Then, in the fall of 2001, Mr. Erthal
said, Ms. Martin disagreed with his suggestion that the violations
warranted broader enforcement action. She told him the plant was
making improvements, Mr. Erthal said, and he ultimately backed off.
Mr. Erthal agreed that the plant had made progress, replacing old
walls in one area and increasing the use of floor sanitizers. But he
also was concerned about how often floor drains got clogged and
backed up into puddles in the processing rooms.
Then, on 28 Aug 2002, he said, he went through a number of the
deficiency notices with his circuit supervisor, Muhammad A. Choudry.
Officials said Mr. Choudry sent an e-mail message to managers in the
Philadelphia district office suggesting that the Wampler plant was a
good candidate for an enforcement notice, which gives a company 3
days to create a plan to fix safety problems or face being
temporarily shut down.
Jan T. Behney, the district manager in Philadelphia, and John Sworen,
then the district's top enforcement officer, said that their aides
reviewed the material within several working days and agreed that the
violations were documented well enough to support a notice.
But Steven Cohen, a spokesman for the inspection service in
Washington, said health officials initially focused on a different
company's plant as the most likely source of the outbreak, and the
district inspection office did not turn its attention to Wampler
until 27 Sep 2002.
Mr. Cohen said the department took 2 samples from the Wampler plant's
drains on 3 or 4 Oct 2002 that matched the strain of listeria in the
outbreak. He added that 25 of the 57 samples tested positive for
other strains of _Listeria monocytogenes_.
Mr. Morris, the Pilgrim's Pride senior vice president, said the
company "diligently worked" to fix the problems with mold and
condensation over the past year. Mr. Morris said Wampler recently
strengthened safety programs.

[This report from the New York Times illustrates the many levels of
issues involved in food safety. We appear to be making some progress
along these fronts, but there is likely to be a long and winding
yellow brick road littered along the way with the lions and tigers
and bears -- and wicked witches -- of outbreaks of food-borne
organisms, until the Emerald City of Uniformly Safe Food is reached
-- if ever. - Mod.LL]
