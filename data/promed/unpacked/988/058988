The 1st Chinese case of a tick-borne disease called [human]
granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA), which then led to person-to-person
transmission of the disease, is described in a study by researchers
at China's National Institute of Communicable Disease Control and
Prevention. It's the 1st known report of human-to-human transmission of HGA.

HGA was identified in the United States in 1990 and in Europe in
1997. The number of infections reported each year in the United
States is rising, with infection rates in endemic areas as high as 15
percent to 36 percent.

The Chinese team launched an investigation after a cluster of HGA
cases occurred in health-care workers and family members following
exposure to a patient with disease symptoms consistent with HGA. The
female patient was bitten by a tick 12 days before the onset of fever
and hemorrhage. She was admitted to a regional hospital in Anhui
province, and later died. Of 28 people who had close contact (20
inches (51 cm) or less) with the patient during the final 12 hours of
her life, 9 became infected with the type of bacteria [_Anaplasma
phagocytophilum_] that causes HGA. All 9 reported contact with the
patient's blood, and 7 had contact with her respiratory secretions.

"The most remarkable aspect of these cases was that transmission was
very unlikely to be tick-borne, but was closely associated with blood
or respiratory secretion from hemorrhage," the researchers wrote.
"Although it is likely that routine blood and fluid precautions will
protect against such future events, strict adherence to protective
protocols is mandatory even if communicability is deemed unlikely."

The researchers added that the lessons of this case study "remain
relevant to the daily hospital and health care unit operations to
prevent any additional [hospital] outbreaks of HGA.

"This report certainly serves to reinforce the importance of adopting
standard blood and body fluid precautions for all patients and
especially for those with HGA; these precautions are the accepted
standard of care in the United States," Dr Peter J Krause, of the
Yale School of Medicine, and Dr Gary P Wormser, of the New York
Medical College, wrote in an accompanying editorial. "The report also
should stimulate further investigation of the existence of _A.
phagocytophilum_ in the region of China where this outbreak originated."

The study was published in the 19 Nov [2008] issue of the Journal of
the American Medical Association.

[The cause of anaplasmosis is _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_, a
rickettsia-like microorganism that was previously referred to as
_Ehrlichia phagocytophila_. _A. phagocytophilum_ is an obligate
intracellular bacterium that infects granulocytes. (Anaplasmosis was
previously called human granulocytic ehrlichiosis, and is now also
called human granulocytic anaplasmosis or HGA.) In the USA,
anaplasmosis is found primarily in the New England, North Central,
and Pacific States. _A. phagocytophilum_ is transmitted by _Ixodes
scapularis_ in the Northeastern and upper Midwest United States, _I.
pacificus_ in the Western United States, _I. ricinus_ in Europe, and
probably _I. persulcatus_ in parts of Asia. These vectors can also
transmit Lyme disease, babesiosis, and, in Europe and Asia,
tick-borne encephalitis. Because of a common tick vector, a patient
infected with any one of these pathogens in the USA and Europe, and
possibly elsewhere in the world, may be co-infected with other
pathogens that the tick vector may be concurrently carrying.

The tick nymph, which is primarily responsible for transmission of
Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, or babesiosis, is less than 3 mm long,
even when fully engorged with blood. Because of its small size, the
bite of a nymph might not be noticed and consequently not be removed
before disease transmission occurs. Indeed, patients frequently do
not recall a tick bite. Nymphs typically feed more actively in May
and June resulting in a peak of clinical illness in July.

In the USA, the usual insect vector for ehrlichiosis, also called
human monocytic ehrlichiosis, is _Amblyomma americanum_, the lone
star tick, which, along with the white-tailed deer, maintains
_Ehrlichiae_ in nature. As a result, ehrlichiosis is mainly found in
the southeastern and south-central US, where the lone star tick is
commonly found. Because of different tick vectors, patients with
ehrlichiosis are unlikely to be co-infected with either Lyme disease
or babesiosis.

Wright stain of peripheral blood smears or buffy-coat preparations
demonstrate stained cytoplasmic inclusions consisting of vacuolar
microcolonies of _A. phagocytophilum_ within neutrophils in 20 to 80
percent of patients with anaplasmosis, unlike the rarity of
visualizing organisms within circulating mononuclear cells in
ehrlichiosis (Weinberg G: Laboratory diagnosis of ehrlichiosis and
babesiosis. Pediat Infect Dis J 2001; 20: 435-7.)

Because _A. phagocytophilum_ is disseminated in the blood stream, it
is not surprising that infected blood could serve as a vehicle for
person-to-person transmission. Indeed, _A. phagocytophilum_ can
survive in refrigerated blood and anaplasmosis has been transmitted
through blood transfusion (Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_ Transmitted Through Blood
Transfusion -- Minnesota, 2007. MMWR 2008; 57: 1145-8. October 2008
[date cited] Available from
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5742a1.htm>).

In anaplasmosis, non-specific symptoms, which normally occur within
1-2 weeks following the bite of an infected tick, may vary from mild
to severe and include fever, chills, malaise, headache, muscle aches
and pain, and absence of skin rash. Laboratory findings include
anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated serum
transaminases. Half the symptomatic patients require hospitalization,
which is associated with older age, higher neutrophil counts, lower
lymphocyte counts, anemia, the presence of morulae in leukocytes, or
underlying immune suppression. Severe complications include a septic
or toxic shock-like syndrome, coagulopathy, acute respiratory
distress syndrome, acute abdominal syndrome, rhabdomyolysis,
myocarditis, acute renal failure, hemorrhage, brachial plexopathy,
demyelinating polyneuropathy, cranial nerve palsies, and
opportunistic infections. Approximately 5 to 7 percent of patients
require intensive care, and the disease can be fatal.

Anaplasmosis should be suspected in patients with the acute onset of
unexplained fever, chills, and headache, often in association with
thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and/or increased liver enzyme levels
with a history of tick exposure within the prior 3 weeks. The
diagnosis of anaplasmosis can be confirmed by a 4-fold increase in
antibody titer by IFA [indirect immunofluorescent assay] in acute and
convalescent phase serum samples, PCR [polymerase chain reaction]
amplification of anaplasma DNA in a clinical specimen, immunostaining
of _A. phagocytophilum_ antigen in a tissue sample, or isolation of
_A. phagocytophilum_ from a clinical specimen in cell culture
(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

cited] Available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncphi/disss/nndss/casedef/ehrlichiosis_2008.htm>).

Treatment with doxycycline 100 mg twice daily orally or intravenously
for 10 days for all symptomatic patients suspected of having
anaplasmosis is recommended for a minimal total course of 10 days.
This treatment regimen should be adequate therapy for patients with
anaplasmosis alone and for patients who are co-infected with Lyme
disease, but is not effective therapy for patients who are
co-infected with babesiosis.
