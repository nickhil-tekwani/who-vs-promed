On 21 Jun 2021, a case of botulism food poisoning was registered in Melitopol, a city in Zaporizhzhia [Zaporizhzhya] Oblast of southeastern Ukraine, according to the city health department.

The patient is a 65-year-old man who bought cold-smoked mackerel in a retail chain and consumed it himself on 18-19 Jun 2021. On the evening of 19 Jun [2021], he felt worsening of the condition -- general weakness and vomiting -- so he was hospitalized at the Melitopol central regional hospital on 21 Jun [2021], where he was diagnosed with botulism. Additionally, symptoms of visual disturbances (diplopia) and weakness of the leg muscles later appeared. On the same day, the patient was transferred to the Zaporizhia Regional Infectious Diseases Hospital in severe condition and was administered a heptavalent antitoxin.

Botulism is a rare but serious illness caused by a toxin produced by _Clostridium botulinum_ bacteria. When ingested, the toxin attacks the body's nerves. Symptoms typically start with muscle weakness in the face and neck and then spreads to the torso, arms, and legs. The toxin weakens muscles used for breathing, which can lead to death. It is important that anyone ill with symptoms of botulism visit a healthcare provider immediately to be assessed.

[Classically, botulism is a foodborne disease caused by the ingestion of a preformed toxin, although there also exists wound botulism (in which _Clostridium botulinum_ spores germinate in a wound), and infant botulism (in which the spores germinate in the intestinal tract).

Types A, B, and E of human botulism are the commonest. Although all types have a similar symptom complex, Hughes and colleagues report that type E, which is usually associated with fish and marine life associated cases is much more likely to produce initial lethargic mental status and more autonomic dysfunction (1). A recent review regarding botulism in Ukraine (2) reported that from 1955 to 2018, 8614 cases of botulism were recorded in Ukraine causing 659 deaths. The distribution of types of botulism toxins was represented by type A (7.97%), B (59.64%), suspected as C (0.56%), E (25.47%), others (5.33%), and unidentified (1.04%).
