Prawn farmers have raised concerns diseased foreign prawns are being dumped in Australia after the Agriculture Department detected 3 contaminated batches at the border.

Raw imports were banned in January 2017, a month after an outbreak of white spot disease destroyed the prawn farming industry on the Logan River. Prawn farmers suspect the disease spread from imported prawns that were used as bait in the river by recreational fishermen.

The department has conceded they will probably never know how the disease entered the country and 5 months ago [June 2017] allowed imports to resume with beefed up regulations.

More than 130 consignments have been imported under the new controls with 3 testing positive for white spot. More than 30 consignments have not yet been tested.

Logan River prawn farmer Serena Zipf, who was forced to destroy all the prawns on her farm earlier this year [2017], said she was concerned importers could attempt to exploit biosecurity loopholes. "We fully suspected that the importers would test the boundaries and test the new system and see whether they could revert to their happy old practices of using Australia as a dumping ground," she told the ABC.

A senate investigation into the outbreak exposed massive breaches of biosecurity at the border and the department has commenced prosecution against an importer with 2 other cases waiting for an assessment from the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions.

An Agriculture Department spokesman said the detections showed the enhanced biosecurity measures were working. "The results support the effectiveness of biosecurity measures that have been implemented by the department," he said. "The department has written to the competent authorities of the countries of export, advising of the positive test result and requesting that the circumstances that resulted in (white spot) positive prawns being sent to Australia be investigated."

Ms Zipf credited the department for tightening regulations but said it was vital anyone purposely breaching biosecurity was prosecuted to "send a very clear message that this will no longer go unpunished". "All the good work of the government can be undone if one single consignment gets into the waterways again," she said.

Australian Prawn Farmers Association President Matt West said the positive tests were "concerning" and highlighted the importance of testing 100 per cent of all consignments at our borders. "Part of the new enhanced import conditions requires countries sending the prawns certifying the consignment is free of white spot, and 3 consignments have failed this," he said.

"It is heartening to know however that government have identified and stopped these consignments from passing through our borders."

[White spot viral disease has caused high mortalities and severe damage to the shrimp culture industry in China, Thailand, Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia and India. The virus was 1st detected in Taiwan in 1992, and then it spread to Japan and almost all Asian countries. The 1st diagnosed case of WSVD in the Americas occurred in 1995 in a South Texas shrimp farm, and it was suggested that the most probable route for its introduction was through an Asian imported frozen-bait shrimp commodity. In February 1999, the virus caused massive mortalities in some farms in Ecuador, and the most recent outbreak occurred in Brazil last year (2016). Reports in Australia began in December 2016.

Acutely affected shrimps are reported to show a rapid reduction in food consumption, become lethargic and have a loose cuticle with white spots (hence, the name "White spot" disease) of 0.5 to 2.0mm in diameter, which are more apparent on the inside surface of the carapace (see http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/g/t/k/v/a/2/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.gtkvca.png/1483356145795.jpg). The white spots represent abnormal deposits of calcium salts by the cuticular epidermis.
