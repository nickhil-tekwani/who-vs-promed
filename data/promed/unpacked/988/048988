[The presentation does not include the statistics of the culled poultry in the affected countries. To illustrate the impact of the stamping-out policy applied in line with EU official requirements, please see further the statistics which have been derived from OIE's WAHID interface. They include the most recent available data from the 2 European countries which have experienced the highest number of HPAI H5N8 outbreaks in poultry, namely Hungary and France (please see also the graph on page 7 in the above presentation):

1. Hungary (as of 24 Feb 2017; start of the event, 01 Nov 2016):
Outbreak summary: Total outbreaks = 233 (Submitted)
Species/ Susceptible/ Cases/ Deaths/ Destroyed/ Slaughtered
Birds/ 2 674 399/ 159 249/ 73 504/ 1 571 078/ 0

2. France (as of 24 Feb 2017; start of the event, 25 Nov 2016):
Outbreak summary: Total outbreaks = 347 (Submitted)
Species/ Susceptible/ Cases/ Deaths/ Destroyed/ Slaughtered
Birds/ 1 402 751/ 14 892/ 16 545/ 1 240 962/ 0

It deserves to be stated that both countries maintain considerable geese and duck farming enterprises; these species have been severely affected.

The broad migration flows of ducks across Europe, considered to be related to the spread of HPAI H5N8 virus, including estimated bird numbers, can be viewed in page 3 of the presentation.

All locations of HPAI H5N8 outbreaks (in poultry, wildfowl and captive birds) reported from Europe since Nov 2016, as of 1 March 2017, are presented on the map on page 2. - Mod.AS
