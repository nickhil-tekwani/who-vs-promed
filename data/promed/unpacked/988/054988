Cattle traders hope for loss recovery. Eid a week away
------------------------------------------------------
As the anthrax scare faded away over the last few weeks and the Eid-ul-Azha
just days away [around 17 Nov 2010], cattle traders are pinning their hopes
to make up for losses during the peak trading season. Though the number of
sacrificial animals, as well as the customers, remains very thin at Gabtali
cattle market in the capital, the prices are still high. "I brought 65 cows
to the market 5 days before the Eid-ul-Fitr, but I faced a loss of around
Tk 3.50 lakh [approx USD 5000] due to the anthrax panic at that time," said
a cattle trader. He has brought 60 cows from Chuadanga one week ago but
could sell only 6, as there are very few customers around.

The number of buyers from Chittagong, Sylhet, Chandpur, and some other
districts this year [2010] is very nominal owing to poor supply of animals
to the market, he added.

"I have come from Sylhet to buy around 20 cows but I find the number of
cattle at the market is less than half compared to that of last year
[2009]," said another trader. He also observed that though he expected
lower price this year, it stays almost same in comparison with last year.

Traders at the market, however, are expecting an influx of cattle just
before 2 to 3 days of the Eid-ul-Azha. "The number of cows in Kushtia is
over double compared to last year's [2009], which will reach different
markets of the city," said Amirul Molla, who brought 16 cows from Kushtia
on Monday [8 Nov 2010].

During the period of anthrax contamination huge number of cattle remained
unsold, which is expected to hit the market soon. The government on [7 Oct
2010] withdrew the anthrax alert, which was imposed on [5 Sep 2010] as it
was spreading rapidly in new districts and infected animals and humans.

Another trader from Kushtia, said they would face huge loss again if they
do not get proper price as the cost of cattle feed almost doubled recently.

A trader brought 8 camels from Rajasthan of India on Monday [8 Nov 2010]
but did not get any response from customers till 2:00 pm yesterday [9 Nov
2010]. He was claiming Tk 4 lakh to 5 lakh [USD 5700-7100] for each, which
is almost double compared to last year [2009]. "We seek high price this
year as there are very few camels in the market," said the caretaker of the
camels.

The price of goats is no exception as the traders are hoping to attract
huge customers due to the recent anthrax scare. "We are asking around Tk
4000 to 5000 [USD 56-71] more for a big size goat compared to last year's,
as we assume the demand of goat will be high this year [2010]," said a seller.

The Dhaka City Corporation is going to set up 13 makeshift cattle markets
this year, which will start functioning 3 days before the Eid-ul-Azha.

A team of department of livestock [veterinarians] has been active in the
market for the last 2 months to monitor the anthrax situation. "We check
whether any sick cattle are there or not," said a veterinary surgeon of
livestock department. Vigilance teams will be deployed in different cattle
markets across the country and the teams will take immediate steps if any
sick cattle are found, said another official of the department.

[This rejection of the sale of cattle has been going on for over a month in
Bangladesh and will have a major impact on the farmers for some time to
come, certainly until the public have regained confidence in the safety of
the meat that they buy in shops and markets. Members are encouraged to read
the original article, which has an excellent picture of camels as well as
an interesting commentary.

A somewhat angry article in the Sri Lanka Guardian commenting on the
political aspects can be read at
<http://www.srilankaguardian.org/2010/11/anthrax-and-eid-ul-azha.html>.

All in all this reinforces the view that disease outbreaks should not be
seen as mere biological events. They take place in a social and economic
environment and with wide impacts. - Mod.MHJ
