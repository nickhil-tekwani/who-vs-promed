The posting on schistosomiasis in the d'Amoron'i Mania region
[Schistosomiasis - Madagascar: d'Amoron'i Mania 20080525.1717]
states: "The report indicates that neurological problems were common
and responded to treatment," but I did not see any comment from
ProMED about this. Neurological problems have been associated with
_Schistosoma japonicum_ infections, but, to my knowledge, not with
_S. haematobium_ or _S. mansoni_ infections.

Was there any indication for attribution of the "neurological
problems?" We know that _Taenia solium_
cysticercosis/neurocysticercosis is hyperendemic in Madagascar, so
perhaps this could be a cause of the neurological problems mentioned.
There is currently discussion between WHO's Department of Control of
Neglected Tropical Diseases and Madagascar's Ministry of Health [MoH]
about treatment measures in areas co-endemic for both schistosomiasis
and cysticercosis.

The Pasteur Institute in Madagascar conducted national serological
surveys for human cysticercosis in the late 1990s (sites included
Mahasolo, Mahajanga, Ambositra, Ihosy, and Tamatave/Antananarivo)
based on detection of antibodies in more than 4000 persons, finding
prevalence of cysticercosis between 7-17 percent in the general
population and 21 percent in a group of epileptics in Ambositra.

Madagascar was the only endemic country to reveal at the World Health
Assembly in 2003, when control of neurocysticercosis was discussed,
that it had a serious problem with cysticercosis and needed
assistance for surveillance, prevention, and control activities.

In addition, US Peace Corps volunteers who have served in Madagascar
have been found to be infected with cysticercosis (see Leutscher P
and Andriantsimahavandy A (2004): Cysticercosis in Peace Corps
Volunteers in Madagascar. New England Journal of Medicine, 350:
311-2), further providing evidence about the risk of infection in the
country.

Madagascar will implement a large-scale distribution of praziquantel
in 21 districts endemic for schistosomiasis in June 2008. The MoH is
aware of the risks associated with co-endemicity with
taeniosis/cysticercosis, and, as a consequence, will implement
surveillance and pharmacovigilance activities aimed at detecting
possible adverse events following treatment.

Please also see the paper by Andriantsimahavandy A et al: "Situation
epidemiologique actuelle de la cysticercose a Madagascar." Arch Inst
Pasteur de Madagascar 2003; 69: 46-51. Data from this paper and from
other sources were used to make a decision on where the routine
surveillance and pharmacovigilance measures had to be intensified
because of the risks associated with co-endemicity.

_S. haematobium_ has been associated with neurological symptoms in
Malawi. The [schistosomiasis] group in Leiden [University,
Netherlands] (Lissette van Lieshout) worked on this. These were
medullary symptoms due to egg granulomas in the lower spinal cord.
The term "neurological problems" stated from Madagascar is vague and
non-defined so we should be careful to immediately associate such
"symptoms" with cysticercosis. We need to get a specification from
Madagascar that the symptoms were cerebral (such as, epilepsy
equivalents.)

[ProMED-mail thanks Drs Willingham and Gabrielli for alerting us to
the problem with cysticercosis in Madagascar as an explanation for
the high prevalence of neurological symptoms.

In neurocysticercosis symptoms can be aggravated during treatment
because the dying cysts cause a local inflammation in the brain with
local edema leading to focal neurological symptoms. This is usually
treated with steroids, but during mass treatment campaigns people
receive treatment without previous investigation for
neurocysticercosis. Therefore the neurological symptoms mentioned in
the posting may be due to the effect of praziquantel on
neurocysticercosis.

ProMED-mail will be interested in further information if available. - Mod.EP]
