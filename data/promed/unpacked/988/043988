----------------------------------------------------------------------
It appears that _Borrelia miyamotoi_ [infection] has signs and symptoms, which could easily be confused with either ehrlichiosis or anaplasmosis. This presents significant problems in correctly diagnosing cases of _B. miyamotoi_ infection, or understanding its true prevalence in states where both anaplasmosis and/or ehrlichiosis occur. This issue will only become more pressing as the lone star tick (_Amblyomma americanum_), vector of ehrlichiosis, expands its range northward into the most Lyme endemic regions of the US, and the "northern variant" blacklegged tick (_Ixodes scapularis_), vector of Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, and _B. miyamotoi_, expands its range southward into ehrlichiosis endemic regions.

Currently, the best laboratory aid available in the diagnosis of acute stage ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis is a multiplex PCR test for those agents in whole blood. And as it appears that _B. miyamotoi_ can be detected by PCR in the blood of infected patients, adding a test for this agent to the multiplex PCR assays already employed by several commercial laboratories would greatly help in the correct diagnosis of these illnesses, and would also aid in understanding the geographic range of _B. miyamotoi_. Additionally, PCR testing may also help distinguish these illnesses from the recently discovered Heartland virus illness [see ProMED-mail post Heartland virus - USA (MO) 2009 20120830.1274007], which is carried by lone star ticks, and which also causes signs and symptoms that could be confused with ehrlichiosis or anaplasmosis.
