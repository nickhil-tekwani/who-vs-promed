GLENMARK RECALLS GROUND BEEF PATTIES NATIONWIDE FOR E.COLI O157:H7
WASHINGTON, November 20, 1998 -- Glenmark Industries Ltd., a Chicago meat
processing firm, is voluntarily recalling three weeks' production of frozen
ground beef patties that may be contaminated with _Escherichia coli_
O157:H7 bacteria, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and
Inspection Service announced today.
The June 24 through July 10 production involves approximately 601,000
pounds of frozen ground beef, of which 366,000 pounds were sold in retail
packages that can be directly purchased by consumers, who may still have it
in their freezers. The company has already contacted its wholesale
distributors and customers to retrieve the product.
Boxes or cartons of patties subject to recall can be identified by
consumers by the following product names and codes:
-- President's Choice Beef Patties, 3-oz patties in 3-lb packages with the
date codes: 8179 followed by 16 through 24;
-- President's Choice Thick and Juicy Beef Patties, 5.3-oz patties in 2-lb
packages with the date codes: 8195 followed by the letters A through H;
-- Glenmark 100% Pure Ground Beef Steak Eater's Beef in 3-lb packages with
the date codes: 1768 followed by 23 and 24; 1778 followed by 18 through 24;
1828 followed by 08 through 23; 1878 followed by 07; 1918 followed by 15
through 23; 1958 followed by 22 through 24; and 1968 followed by 08 through
23 ;

1828 followed by 19 through 21;
-- Armour Premium Beef Burgers in 3-lb packages and 1.5-lb packages with
date codes: 8175; 8182; 8187; 8189; 8190; 8191; 8196; 8197.
Product packaged for retail sale may have been distributed nationwide.
USDA learned of the problem when a customer became ill and was admitted to
the hospital in Albany, NY. The NY State Health Department tested the
product from an open package from the freezer of the ill customer and found
_E. coli_ O157:H7. FSIS sampled patties from the same lot obtained from a
warehouse in Western Massachusetts and confirmed the positive finding.
_E. coli_ O157:H7 is a potentially deadly pathogen that can cause bloody
diarrhea and dehydration. The very young, the elderly, and persons with
compromised immune systems are the most susceptible to foodborne illness.
_E. coli_ O157:H7 bacteria have been implicated in several recent outbreaks
of foodborne illness across the United States.
"Because of the potential hazard of foodborne disease from consumption of
undercooked or under-processed meat and poultry products contaminated with
pathogens such as _E. coli_ O157:H7, we urge consumers who may have
purchased the suspect product to return it to the place of purchase," said
Thomas J. Billy, administrator of USDA's Food Safety and Inspection
Service. "USDA is informing the public so consumers who may have purchased
product will check for the product in their freezers," Billy said.
Consumers with questions about the recall may phone the toll-free USDA Meat
and Poultry Hotline at 1-800-535-4555. The Hotline can be reached from 10
a.m. to 4 p.m. (Eastern Time) Monday through Friday
