West Nile Virus Infected Crow Found in Mississauga, Ontario
-----------------------------------------------------------
Preliminary tests indicate West Nile virus was present in a dead crow
found in Mississauga on 19 May 2002. Last year was the first that the
virus was found in Canada. In 2001, 128 birds in southern Ontario
were found and confirmed to have been carrying the virus. The first of
those dead birds turned up on 8 Aug 2001, more than 2-1/2 months
later than this year's first reported case.
A number of [states] in the United States have also confirmed cases of
West Nile virus in recent weeks, earlier than usual for all but the most
temperate regions. Experts are not yet sure what is behind the apparent
change, but it is cause for concern. "It may indicate that we're seeing a
higher level of virus activity, in the spring. How that translates into the
rest of the season remains to be seen," said Dr. Howard Shapiro,
Associate Medical Officer of Health for the Region of Peel, which
includes Mississauga where the dead crow was found.
Dr. Harvey Artsob, Chief of Zoonotic Diseases for Health Canada, said:
"Of more concern to us, up in Ontario, is that they have found a
number of confirmed cases in areas close to us. Places such as
Michigan, Pennsylvania, Illinois, New York, and New Jersey." He said
there had been cases found this early in the past in and around New
York City, the area where the West Nile virus made headlines when 7
people who were infected died in 1999.
Dr. Anthony Marfin, with the Division of Vector-borne Infectious
Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Fort
Collins, Colorado, said areas that have seen increased surveillance for
West Nile virus tend to have more cases turn up earlier in the second
year that a particular region is affected. He speculates the lack of a
harsh winter in the north may mean more potential [mosquito] carriers.
In the wake of the news of the dead crow found in Mississauga, the
Region of Peel issued its standard warning and set of instructions for
the public, such as avoiding areas with high mosquito populations,
using mosquito repellent, making sure there is no standing water on
their property allowing mosquitoes to breed.
