Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: El Pinero, Zamora, Castilla y Leon
Date of start of the outbreak: 24 Jan 2019
Outbreak status: Resolved on 19 Feb 2019
Epidemiological unit: Farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Cattle / 465 / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0

Affected population: A case positive to type LBSE. Cohort localized. Investigations ongoing.
Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Cattle / 0.22 / 0.22 / 100 / 0.22
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: [On 25 Jan 2019], the Central Veterinary Laboratory in Algete (National Reference Laboratory [NRL] for TSEs, accredited under UNE-EN ISO/IEC 17025:2005 standard) received a nerve tissue sample suspected of infection by bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) from the accredited Regional Laboratory for Animal Health in Villaquilambre, Leon (official regional laboratory) after a positive result was obtained through a Bio-Rad TeSeE SAP rapid test. The NRL carried out the confirmation tests authorized according to EU Regulation No. 1148/2014. The selected combined tests were Bio-Rad TeSeE Wb confirmation Western blot and ELISA (Idexx HerdChek BSE-Scrapie Antigen Test Kit), and positive results were obtained for both tests. Afterward, tests for BSE strain discrimination were carried out through hybrid immunoblotting with antibodies against PrP, confirming atypical BSE (H-type strain). The sample was taken within the national TSE surveillance program (sampling of dead or nonslaughtered for human consumption animals over 48 months old). The animal was a Holstein-like bred cow born [on 30 Jul 2013].

Control measures
Measures applied: Traceability; official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste; selective killing and disposal; disinfection; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: Official destruction of animal products

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Central Veterinary Laboratory, Algete (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Cattle / Western blot / 19 Feb 2019 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

["In addition to the 'classical' BSE prion [C-type BSE], at least 2 atypical BSE prions can be found in cattle. One has higher molecular mass fragments than classical BSE and is called 'H-type' BSE or H-BSE; the other has a lower molecular mass and is called 'L-type' BSE or L-BSE. The disease caused by the latter organism has also been termed 'bovine amyloidotic spongiform encephalopathy (BASE).' Atypical BSE prions are thought to represent additional strains of BSE. Currently, the most likely hypothesis is that they arise spontaneously in cattle, similar to some prion diseases in other species (e.g., spontaneous Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans). L-BSE and H-BSE have been reported to change to a classical BSE phenotype on passage in some types of mice. This has led to the suggestion that one of these prions may have originally given rise to the BSE epidemic after amplification through the food chain." http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/bovine_spongiform_encephalopathy.pdf

"The emergence of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) in humans has been causally linked to ingestion of C-type BSE. It is not known whether atypical cases are causally linked to forms of human prion diseases. Recommended safety precautions for handling the agent are based on the assumption that all forms of BSE are zoonotic. Biocontainment for necropsies and tissue handling should be risk-based and compliant with relevant national regulations; any procedure creating aerosols must be performed at an appropriate biosafety and containment level determined by biorisk analysis, and the laboratory must comply with national biocontainment and biosafety regulations to protect staff from exposure to the pathogen. Recommended physical inactivation is by porous load autoclaving at 134 deg C to 138 deg C (273 deg F to 280 deg F) for 18 minutes at 30 lb/in2 (208 kPa or 2.2 bar). However, total inactivation may not be achieved under certain conditions, such as when the test material is in the form of a macerate, of high titre or when the agent is protected within dried organic matter. Disinfection of potential fomites is carried out using sodium hypochlorite containing 2% available chlorine, or 2 N sodium hydroxide, applied for more than 1 hour at 20 deg C (68 deg F) for surfaces, or overnight for equipment." http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.04.05_BSE.pdf. - Mod.CRD
