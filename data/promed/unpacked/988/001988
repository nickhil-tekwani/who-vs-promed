West Nile Fever Recognized as Epidemic
---------------------------------------
Three months after this year's first West Nile virus patient was diagnosed,
the Health Ministry yesterday held its first press conference on the subject
and admitted that what it has been calling an outbreak could be termed an
"epidemic." Ministry associate director-general Dr. Boaz Lev - who for weeks
had been saying there was "nothing unusual" and that the increased number of
cases was due to improved reporting due to new lab equipment at Sheba
Hospital at Tel Hashomer - now concedes there is an unusually large number
of cases. So far, 13 Israelis aged 54 to 90, mostly north of Tel Aviv, have
died, while an additional 161 have been infected. The virus is transmitted
solely by mosquitoes that have bitten infected animals, mostly poultry and
birds. Lev said that the autumn stay-over for a few weeks of migrating birds
in Israel and the hot, humid weather seemed to have increased the numbers of
cases. Healthy people need not worry, but the elderly and others of all ages
with weak immune systems and chronic illnesses should be careful by using
mosquito repellents and keeping indoors in the evening, when female
mosquitoes tend to bite. Lev also urged high-risk groups to go to their
health fund clinics for influenza and pneumococcal pneumonia vaccinations as
soon as possible.

Israel Declares An Epidemic of West Nile Virus
----------------------------------------------
JERUSALEM: Health authorities declared an epidemic of West Nile virus today,
saying the mosquito-borne illness has killed 13 people in Israel this summer
and infected thousands more. The virus has been in Israel for decades, but
had not been seen in the Western Hemisphere until last year, when it killed
7 people in New York City. Israel is the first country to have declared
an epidemic since the virus spread to the United States. The virus is also
found in other Middle Eastern countries, Africa, Europe and Asia. "I guess
thousands have been infected. There are 160 confirmed cases, but those are
mainly patients who came to the hospitals," said Dr. Silvio Pitlik, director
of internal medicine and infectious disease at Rabin Medical Center and an
adviser to the Israeli government. Most cases have been located in Israel's
central coastal plain and have not reached outlying or hilly areas,
including Jerusalem. Health officials asked Israelis to take extra
precautions against mosquito bites, such as using repellent and wearing long
sleeves. A few communities have been dusting against mosquitoes. However,
the Environment Ministry has vetoed blanket dusting, saying air quality
concerns must be taken into consideration as well. This year's outbreak was
the worst in Israel in several years, said Pitlik. He said experts suspected
it could be linked to changing patterns in bird migration.

West Nile Virus in Israel
--------------------------
It is being reported on ProMED-mail that the Israel Ministry of Health had
officially declared an epidemic of West Nile Fever in Israel. The current
outbreak in Israel actually began in August, and questions have been raised
as to why has the term epidemic only been used now. Professionals in the
field will probably agree that technically there is no difference between
the terms epidemic and outbreak, and that the terms can be used
interchangeably to describe any unusual increase in cases of either
infectious or non-infectious diseases. The public [and politicians appears
to have a different perception of the terms "epidemic" and "outbreak", and
may view an "epidemic" as describing only the widespread occurrence of a
contagious disease (whose spread cannot be controlled?).Since the
communication of health risks to the public is an important issue, perhaps
we need to redefine the terminology and clarify our messages to the public.
For example, was the outbreak of West Nile Fever in New York in 1999, an
"epidemic"? If so, at what stage was it correct to call it an epidemic?
After the diagnosis of the first 2 cases? I'd be interested to hear
comments on this issue.

[To address Dr. Green's questions a search of existing documents on the
West Nile virus activity in the U.S. came up with the conclusion that the
WNV activity in 1999 was considered to be outbreak/epidemic. In a Mar 2000
document from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(Epidemic/Epizootic West Nile Virus in the United States: Guidelines for
Surveillance, Prevention and Control, From a workshop cosponsored by the
Department of Health and Human Services, CDC and the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, Held in Fort Collins, Colorado, 8-9 Nov 1999), the background
section opens with "The epidemic of West Nile (WN) viral encephalitis in
the New York Metropolitan area in the summer of 1999 was unexpected and
underscores once again the ease with which human and animal pathogens can
move among the world's population centers." In that same document,
Appendix C the term outbreak and epidemic are used interchangeably and are
defined as "multiple confirmed cases in humans".
In Grein TW, Kamara KBO, Rodier G, Plant AJ, Bovier P, Ryan MJ, Ohyama T
and Heymann DL Rumors of Disease in the Global Village: Outbreak
Verification EID 6:2 Mar-Apr 2000, there is a good definition of outbreak
as used by the World Health Organization. "Upon receipt of feedback, the
outbreak verification team determines if the event meets the definition of
an outbreak (observed number of cases exceeds expected number of cases in a
given population for a given period) and the criteria for international
public health importance. Reaching a final decision may require further
consultation with the WHO regional office or the country representative or
health authorities in-country."
Given these two definitions, it seems that the marked increases in reported
cases and deaths due to West Nile virus infection in Israel over the past
two months would meet both the CDC and the WHO working definitions of
"outbreak/epidemic". - Mod.MPP
