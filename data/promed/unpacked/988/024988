USA: Las Vegas Hotel and Charter Airline Undergo Decontamination
-------------------------------------------------
Cleanup continues in the wake of a norovirus outbreak at the California
Hotel and at a charter airline that brought passengers from Hawaii to the
downtown resort in December 2003.
Environmental Health Supervisor Daniel Maxson, in a report to the Clark
County Health District Board Thursday, said the California [Hotel and
Casino] is in the process of cleaning its chips and coins and on Wednesday
used a disinfectant fog in the casino area. Maxson said the resort's owner,
Boyd Gaming Corp., has provided information to the Health District "in an
unprecedented manner" to assist the district in its investigation into the
outbreak. Boyd's assistance, included providing detailed charter flight
records dating to 1 Dec 2003, Maxson said.
A charter airline that was visited by health inspectors as part of the
incident investigation also has begun using "a hospital-grade disinfectant"
to clean the DC-10s that brought the afflicted tourists here and took them
home, Maxson said.
To date there have been 6 confirmed cases of norovirus infection and 1540
reported cases of norovirus symptoms from the incident. The incident came
to the attention of health officials after more than 100 California Hotel
guests came down with symptoms on and shortly after 3 Dec 2003. The
symptoms of the illness are similar to stomach flu, with vomiting and
diarrhea that last about 24 hours. The illness is [similar to that
affecting] cruise ship passengers and other casinos in recent years. Clark
County Chief Health Officer Dr. Donald Kwalick said after the meeting that
while efforts are continuing to prevent future outbreaks, the source of the
virus may never be established.

Norovirus Molecular Epidemiology Database
-----------------------------------------
The norovirus database contains a collection of over 1000 sequences of
norovirus strains and associated epidemiological data collected over a
period of more than 10 years by the Enteric Virus Unit. Data comprises
partial sequences of genes encoding the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (ORF1)
and the capsid (ORF2) as well as information on genotype, polymerase type,
year of isolation, geographical location, age of patient, and outbreak setting.
(1) Polymerase Sequence Comparisons
The database can be searched by entering a norovirus polymerase gene
sequence. The submitted sequence is compared initially with prototype
strains of norovirus genogroups I and II and subsequently to the whole
database. A sequence alignment is generated in which the prototype strain
and 4 database strains with the highest degree of homology to the submitted
sequence are highlighted. A dendrogram, generated from this data, may also
be examined in order to determine the genogroup of the submitted sequence.
The search can then be further refined through searching within either
genogroup I or II database entries. A facility for searching capsid
sequence data will soon be available. The epidemiological data associated
with strains demonstrating the highest homology to the submitted sequence
can be searched by clicking on the highlighted entries in the alignment.
(2) Epidemiological Comparisons
Strains in the database can also be compared on the basis of specific
epidemiological criteria (age, country, and outbreak setting). The
epidemiological information is shown as a chart or a table. Sectors on the
charts can be used to retrieve polymerase sequences from these strains.
(i) Norovirus Strains by Patient Age. (The number of cases increase with age).
(ii) Norovirus Strains by Country. (90.5 percent of isolates originate from
the UK and the remainder from 23 other countries or regions).
(iii) Norovirus Strains by Outbreak Setting. (The majority of the cases
originate from hospitals and nursing homes at 56.2 percent, followed by
sporadic cases at 13 percent, and cruise ship passengers and crew at 7.8
percent).
(3)Submissions to the norovirus database
Users can add to the database by providing sequence and epidemiological
data as an e-mail attachment to <Miren.Iturriza@hpa.org.uk> . Sequence can
be provided as *.fas, *.txt, *.abi or *.scf files, and the positions of the
primers used should be indicated. Epidemiological data should include month
and year of isolation, geographical location, outbreak setting, and age and
sex of the patient. This database is curated by staff of the Enteric Virus
Unit and the Bioinformatics Group of the Health Protection Agency.
