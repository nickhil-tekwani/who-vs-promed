Acute hepatitis and liver failure following the use of a dietary supplement intended for weight loss or muscle building
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary: Recently, a number of previously healthy individuals developed acute hepatitis and sudden liver failure of unknown cause after using a dietary supplement for weight loss or muscle building. CDC recommends increased vigilance by public health agencies, emergency departments, and healthcare providers for patients who develop acute hepatitis or liver failure following use of a weight loss or muscle building nutritional supplement. CDC requests that state health departments report such occurrences to the CDC. CDC also recommends that, as part of a comprehensive evaluation, clinicians evaluating patients with acute hepatitis should ask about consumption of dietary supplements.

Background
----------
On 9 Sep 2013, the Hawaii Department of Health (DOH) was notified of 7 patients with severe acute hepatitis and sudden liver failure of unknown cause. The patients were previously healthy and sought medical care from May through September 2013. Clinicians reported that the 7 patients had all used OxyELITE Pro, a dietary supplement marketed for weight loss and muscle gain, prior to illness onset.

The investigation is ongoing and the data presented are preliminary. Thus far, clinicians have reported 45 patients to the Hawaii DOH in response to a public health alert. Of those, 29 patients, including the original 7, were confirmed to have acute hepatitis after using a nutritional supplement for weight loss or muscle building. The median age of the 29 patients is 33 years; 14 (48 percent) are male. The date of the 1st reported laboratory test was used as a proxy for illness onset and ranged from 10 May through 3 Oct 2013. The most commonly reported symptoms included loss of appetite, light-colored stools, dark urine, and jaundice. Median laboratory values reported at the peak of illness were the following:
- aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 1128 IU/L;
- alanine transaminase (ALT) 1,793 IU/L;
- alkaline phosphatase 150 IU/L; and
- total bilirubin 12.6 mg/dL.

Ten patients had liver biopsy data available at the time of this report. 7 had histology consistent with hepatitis from drug/toxic injury, with findings including hepatocellular necrosis and cholestasis. 3 patients had liver biopsy findings of acute hepatitis associated with other etiologies such as autoimmune hepatitis. Eleven (38 percent) patients were hospitalized, with a median duration of 7 days. One patient died, and 2 patients received liver transplants. 2 remain hospitalized, and all other hospitalized patients have been discharged.

Of the 29 identified patients, 24 (83 percent) reported using OxyELITE Pro during the 60 days prior to illness onset. There was no other dietary supplement or medication use reported in common by more than 2 patients.

National case finding efforts have identified several individuals from states outside Hawaii with reported OxyELITE Pro or other weight loss or muscle building dietary supplement use prior to the development of acute hepatitis of unknown cause. CDC, in collaboration with state health departments, is collecting additional clinical and epidemiologic information from these individuals to determine if this outbreak is national in scope.

Case definition
---------------
An individual with acute-onset hepatitis of unknown etiology that developed symptoms on or after 1 Apr 2013 following use of a non-prescription weight loss or muscle building dietary supplement during the 60 days prior to illness onset.
With acute-onset hepatitis of unknown etiology defined as having BOTH:
- ALT greater than 4 times the upper limit of normal;
- total bilirubin greater than 2 times the upper limit of normal; AND
- negative workup for infectious or other explicative etiologies for hepatitis. Workup for other potential etiologies should include:
- hepatic imaging (that is, ultrasound/doppler, CT scan, MRI) not consistent with alternative, explicative etiologies;
- negative viral hepatitis panel;
- no pre-existing diagnosis of chronic liver disease (such as, autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, Wilson's disease, hemochromatosis);
- no recent hypotensive shock or septic episodes;
- no history of alcoholism documented in medical records

Recommendations
---------------
Clinicians evaluating patients with acute hepatitis should ask about consumption of dietary supplements as part of a comprehensive evaluation.

Clinicians should report patients meeting the case definition to the local or state health department, as well as the US Food and Drug Administration's MedWatch program online at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/medwatch/ or by phone at 1-888-INFO-FDA.

People who use dietary supplements for weight loss or muscle gain should do so with caution and under a medical provider's close supervision.

For more information state public health agencies should contact CDC at (866) 933-5295 if they identify patients who meet the case definition.

Department of Health requests voluntary removal of OxyELITE Pro supplement from sale
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Hawaii State Department of Health (DOH) is alerting local retailers and requesting the voluntary removal from sale of the product OxyELITE Pro pending an ongoing investigation of cases of liver failure and acute hepatitis. DOH Food and Drug Branch today [8 Oct 2013] began notifying retailers and distributors to voluntarily suspend sales and remove the product from store shelves until further notice. The public is advised to discontinue use of the product at this time.

DOH is currently investigating 29 cases of acute hepatitis and liver failure that have occurred in the state from May through October 2013 and may be related to the use of diet supplements for weight loss and/or muscle building. The cases under investigation include 2 individuals that have undergone liver transplants and 1 death.

"24 cases reported using OxyELITE Pro before their illness," said Dr Sarah Park, State Epidemiologist. "No other supplement or medication has been identified in common among more than 2 patients."

"The department continues to urge people who use dietary or nutritional supplements for weight loss and/or muscle gain to talk with their doctor or health care provider," said Health Director Loretta Fuddy. "Anyone who develops symptoms such as abdominal pain or discomfort, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea and /or vomiting, and yellow skin or eyes, should consult their doctor immediately."

DOH is working closely with the US Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention throughout the ongoing investigation.

[Finding hard facts about this product was somewhat problematic. The following information seemed the most concise and detailed and has been extracted from http://www.newhealthguide.org/Oxyelite-Pro-Side-Effects.html.

"People use various ways to lose weight fast. While some spend hours working out in the gym and limiting their food intake, others turn to 'fat burners' or thermogenic supplements such as OxyELITE Pro, a pill that can speed up the rate of fat metabolism. But while it causes the heart to beat faster and promises to burn fat more efficiently, people must learn if it is truly effective and if it is safe to use.

What is OxyELITE Pro?
---------------------
OxyELITE Pro is a fat-burning pill that is used by dieters to lose weight. It has 6 active ingredients, which include:
- Caffeine, a natural fat burner found in coffee and tea;
- _Bacopa monnieri_, a substance which increases T4, a thyroid hormone;
- _Bauhinia purpurea_, which helps converts T4 to the more potent T3 thyroid hormone, resulting in increased fat burning;
- _Rauwolfia_, which aids in blocking alpha-2 receptors which promote fat storage;
- _Cirsium oligophyllum_, which prevents fat gain;
- _Geranium_, which is similar to caffeine and increases alertness.

Thermogenics like OxyELITE Pro are effective in burning calories and in making you feel more energetic despite absorbing fewer calories. OxyELITE also helps suppress appetite, which is the difficult part of dieting. Furthermore, the combination of caffeine and geranium enhances your mood and increases your focus.

OxyELITE Pro side effects
-------------------------
OxyELITE Pro is undoubtedly effective in stimulating one's mood, increasing energy, and suppressing appetite. However, what is good for some people may not be good for others. For one thing, sustained arousal or stimulation may increase fat metabolism but it also represents a constant state of stress, which can strain the adrenal glands and the immune system. These effects can make the body more tired and prone to disease. Furthermore, some of its active ingredients have side effects, which can likewise be harmful to one's health.

The following are the possible side effects both men and women using OxyELITE Pro may experience:
- Caffeine-induced side effects: OxyELITE Pro contains caffeine, which speeds up metabolism. However, caffeine can be addictive and can cause several side effects, including nausea, dizziness, queasiness, racing heart, hypertension, restlessness, insomnia, nervousness, irritability, muscle twitching, increased urination, constipation
- Increase in sweating: as the name implies, thermogenics like OxyELITE Pro promote body heating that results in increased sweating. As your body heats up to burn more calories, the body employs a natural process, sweating, which reduces the body temperature. Of all the OxyELITE Pro side effects, this is the most difficult for some users because it is not only uncomfortable, but can also be publicly embarrassing.
- Decrease in appetite: loss of appetite is an expected goal of the product, but some people may not be happy with this effect. One more undesirable effect is that not only fat is lost, but muscle mass as well. Furthermore, for people who stop using the pill the reverse effects may occur and they may not be able to function without taking it.
- Heart problems: OxyELITE Pro is a vasoconstrictor, which shrinks the diameter of blood vessels and impedes blood flow. With an increased heart rate, vasoconstriction can increase blood pressure, which can increase one's risk for a heart attack or stroke. When used with exercise, this can be potentially dangerous.

OxyELITE Pro side effects for women:
- Hot flashes: some users of OxyELITE Pro have reported hot flashes. This is from the increase in thermogenic compounds which can increase the metabolism. The side effect of increased metabolism is sudden hot flashes.
- Effects on the menstrual cycle: some women have reported that OxyELITE Pro affects their menstrual cycle. They experience delayed or missed periods, and sometimes, excessive bleeding. Others complain of cramps and restlessness. You must consult a doctor before using the supplement especially if you are pregnant or have a history of premature childbirth or abortion. Do not forget that it may also be harmful to the fetus if you are pregnant.

OxyELITE Pro Side effects for men:
- Erection problem: about 1 percent of men who use OxyELITE Pro suffer from erection problem. This is a side effect of 1,3 dimethylamylamine, which is an ingredient that acts as a vasoconstrictor. The side effect lasts only for a few days.

Warnings for taking OxyELITE Pro
---------------------------------
- OxyELITE Pro is not meant to be used by pregnant or nursing women, or by anyone who is under 18 years old. People who have a family history or personal history of a heart attack, liver, kidney, or heart disease or other medical problems must consult a doctor before taking the product.
- Never take OxyELITE Pro with other stimulants or pre-workout drinks used by bodybuilders. Never mix it with drugs containing amphetamines or antidepressants.
- Never take OxyELITE Pro after 5 pm or you will not be able to get some sleep."

I would like to suggest to readers that dietary supplements are NOT harmless. Herbs, concoctions, extractions, teas, plants, etc., may well contain biologically active substances. They may not act as quickly as modern drugs but they are nevertheless active substances affecting parts of the body. Any supplement should be taken according to manufacturer's directions and still with caution. - Mod.TG
