Report of suspected polio cases in the Syrian Arab Republic - [19 Oct 2013]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
On [17 Oct 2013], the World Health Organization (WHO) received reports of a cluster of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases in the Syrian Arab Republic. This cluster of 'hot' AFP was detected in early October 2013 in Deir Al Zour province and is currently being investigated. Initial results from the national polio laboratory in Damascus indicate that 2 of the cases could be positive for polio -- final results are awaited from the regional reference laboratory of the Eastern Mediterranean Region of WHO. Wild poliovirus was last reported in Syria in 1999.

The Ministry of Health of the Syrian Arab Republic confirms that it is treating this event as a cluster of 'hot' AFP cases, pending final laboratory confirmation, and an urgent response is currently being planned across the country. Syria is considered at high-risk for polio and other vaccine-preventable diseases due to the current situation.

A surveillance alert has been issued for the region to actively search for additional potential cases. Supplementary immunization activities in neighbouring countries are currently being planned.

WHO's International Travel and Health recommends that all travelers to and from polio-infected areas be fully vaccinated against polio.

[As mentioned in the report above, if confirmed, these will be the 1st cases of polio confirmed in Syria since 1999. According to a newswire report on this event, a cluster of "10 paralysis cases" has been identified in Syria (see Helen Branswell's article in the Canadian Press at http://globalnews.ca/news/912945/polio-suspected-in-war-torn-syria-who-says-potential-exists-for-large-outbreak/). Still pending is confirmation that a poliovirus has been identified from one or more of these AFP cases, and if so, what type of poliovirus (wild poliovirus -- WPV -- vs possible vaccine derived poliovirus -- VDPV). And, if WPV is identified, the genetic profile of the virus to determine the possible origin of the virus. WPV genetically related to WPV in Pakistan has been circulating in nearby Israel and the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Additional information of interest is the age of the cases and their vaccination histories.

Unfortunately it appears as though civil unrest is a significant factor impeding the polio eradication efforts. The disruption of the public health infrastructures in countries with civil unrest, combined with security concerns where vaccinators have been targets for violence, is a major obstacle.

The province (governorate) of Deir al Zour (Dayr az Zawr) can be seen on the map at http://www.ephotopix.com/syria_province_map.html. It is located in the northeast of the country, bordering with Iraq. If WPV is confirmed, given the civil unrest in Iraq, one wonders if there might be WPV circulating across the border in Iraq as well.

Data in WHO as of 16 Oct 2012 for 2012 data and 15 Oct 2013 for 2013 data.

Highlights of the week
----------------------
- 11 new wild poliovirus (WPV) cases were reported in the past week (one from Afghanistan, 2 from Ethiopia, 4 from Pakistan, and 4 from Somalia).
- Although the total WPV count is now higher than the same period 2012, the quantity of cases from the 3 endemic countries is 60 percent of the same time period 2012. Afghanistan has one third and Nigeria half the amount of cases when compared to 2012. Pakistan, with the majority of cases from Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), has almost identical numbers to this time 2012. The situation in North Waziristan, FATA [Federally Administered Tribal Areas], is becoming increasingly severe, as it is the area with the largest number of children being paralyzed by poliovirus in all of Asia.

Afghanistan
-----------
- One new WPV1 case was reported in the past week. The total number of WPV cases for 2013 is now 7 (all WPV1), all of which were reported from Eastern Region, close to the Pakistan border. The most recent WPV1 case had onset of paralysis on [15 Sep 2013], from Kunar province.
- No new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2013 remains 3. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [13 Mar 2013] (from Kandahar, Southern Region).

Nigeria
-------
- No new WPV cases were reported this week. The total number of WPV cases for 2013 remains 49 (all WPV1s). The most recent WPV1 case in the country had onset of paralysis on [10 Sep 2013] (from Kano).
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 remains one (with onset of paralysis on [6 Jun 2013], from Borno).
- The primary challenges remain to access all children in Borno state, including in areas currently inaccessible during supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) due to insecurity, and to further improve the quality of SIA implementation in Kano state.

Pakistan
--------
- 4 new WPV1 cases were reported in the past week. All were reported from FATA (2 from Khyber Agency and 2 from North Waziristan). The total number of WPV1 cases for Pakistan in 2013 is now 43. The most recent WPV1 case had onset of paralysis on [26 Sep 2013] (from Khyber Agency). The majority of WPV1 cases in Pakistan this year [2013], 31 (72 percent), are from FATA, of which 14 are from Khyber Agency and 13 from North Waziristan.
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for Pakistan remains 29. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis [12 Sep 2013] (from North Waziristan).
- The situation in North Waziristan is becoming increasingly severe, as it is the area with the largest number of children being paralyzed by wild poliovirus (13 cases) and cVDPV2s (22) in all of Asia. It is in an area where immunization activities have been suspended by local leaders since June 2012. It is critical that children in these areas are vaccinated and protected from poliovirus. Immunizations in neighboring high-risk areas are being intensified, to further boost population immunity levels in those areas and prevent further spread of this outbreak.

Chad, Cameroon, and Central African Republic
--------------------------------------------
- In Chad, no new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The most recent WPV case had onset of paralysis on [14 Jun 2012] (WPV1 from Lac). No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 remains 4 (the most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [12 May 2013] from Ennedi).
- In Cameroon, no new cVDPV2 case was reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 remains 4. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [12 Aug 2013] (from Kolfata, Extreme-Nord).
- Central African Republic (CAR) continues to be at serious risk of re-infection due to proximity with Chad, ongoing insecurity and humanitarian crises, and destruction of health infrastructure.

Horn of Africa
--------------
- 6 new WPV1 cases were reported in the past week (4 from Somalia and 2 from Ethiopia). The total number of WPV cases (all WPV1) for 2013 in the Horn of Africa is now 197 (174 from Somalia, 14 from Kenya, 6 from Ethiopia, and 3 from South Sudan). The most recent WPV1 case in the region had onset of paralysis on [19 Sep 2014] (from Somali region, Ethiopia).
- Outbreak response across the Horn of Africa is continuing. As a result of concerted outbreak response efforts, the impact of the response is beginning to be seen, as the number of newly reported cases from Banadir, Somalia (the epicentre of the outbreak) has declined. At the same time, operations are improving as more children are being reached, including in some inaccessible areas of south-central Somalia. However, more needs to be done, because as many as 500 000 children still remain inaccessible in parts of south-central Somalia and other areas of the Horn of Africa remain at risk of re-infection.

Israel and West Bank and Gaza
-----------------------------
- Although no case of paralytic polio has been reported, environmental surveillance suggests that WPV1 transmission, first detected in February 2013, continues in southern and parts of central Israel. WPV1-positive samples were detected also in West Bank (2 sites) and the Gaza Strip (1 site).
- Since 2005, only inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) has been used for routine childhood immunization in Israel. To interrupt WPV1 transmission, a nationwide supplementary immunization activity (SIA) with bivalent OPV targeting children less than 10 years of age has been ongoing since August [2013].
- Following a consultation with the country's immunization advisory group, the Israeli Ministry of Health has recently decided to re-introduce OPV into the national immunization schedule.

West Africa
-----------
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The most recent case in the region was a WPV1 from Tahoua province in Niger with onset of paralysis on [15 Nov 2012].
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week from Niger. The country has reported a single case of cVDPV in 2013, with onset of paralysis on [11 Jul 2013]. Genetic sequencing has shown that the virus is related to that seen in Cameroon, Chad and Nigeria (Borno).
- Multi-country synchronized immunization campaigns are planned in West Africa for late October [2013]. Additional subnational campaigns were conducted [7-9 Sep 2013] in Niger, and additional rounds are planned in the region for early November [2013].

[Since the last ProMED-mail update on polio in late September 2013, there have been 26 new confirmed cases of WPV -- from 270 to 296 cases (Poliomyelitis - update (22): South Sudan, global 20130930.1976296). Of these 26 newly confirmed cases, 20 have been in the 3 endemic countries (15 in Pakistan, 3 in Afghanistan, and 2 in Nigeria) and 6 have been identified in the ongoing outbreak in the Horn of Africa (3 in Ethiopia and 3 in South Sudan). According to the above report from the Polio Eradication Initiative, it states that there have been 6 new cases reported from the Horn of Africa - 2 from Ethiopia and 4 from Somalia. The table included with this report states there are 174 cases reported from Somalia, 3 in South Sudan and 6 cases reported from Ethiopia as of 16 Oct 2013. According to the similar table contained in the prior ProMED-mail post Poliomyelitis - update (22): South Sudan, global 20130930.1976296, as of 24 Sep 2013, there had been 174 cases in Somalia, 3 in Ethiopia, and no cases had been officially confirmed in South Sudan.

Of note, given the same number of confirmed cases reported from Somalia, as of 24 Sep 2013, the most recent confirmed case had onset on 27 Aug 2013, whereas in this past week's report, the most recent confirmed case in Somalia was recorded as having date of onset on 14 Sep 2013. Clarification of this information would be greatly appreciated.

In the year to date comparisons with 2012, there are now more cases confirmed with WPV in 2013 than at this time in 2012 -- 296 cases confirmed in 2013 compared with 223 cases confirmed in 2012. While the good news is that there appears to be a decrease in the numbers of confirmed cases of WPV in the 3 endemic countries, the bad news is that there has been a large outbreak in the Horn of Africa involving Somalia, Kenya, Ethiopia and South Sudan, and there is an outbreak presently suspected in Syria.
