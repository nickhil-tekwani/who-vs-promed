Officials in the southeastern Ukraine city of Melitopol are reporting the 1st human case of dirofilariasis this past January [2021]. The individual was confirmed as having dirofilariasis of the eyelid.

There have been 200 cases reported in Ukraine in the past 2 decades.

Experts say that in recent years, there has been an increase in the incidence of dirofilariasis in those countries where it is considered rare. You can protect yourself only by preventing mosquito bites.

The definitive treatment of dirofilaria infection in humans is surgical removal of lung granulomas and nodules under the skin; this treatment is also curative.

[Human infection with _D. repens_ is well known in the Russia Federation and the countries previously part of the Soviet Union.

A recent review included data from 236 human patients (Ermakova LA, Nagorny SA, Krivorotova EY, Pshenichnaya NY, Matina ON. _Dirofilaria repens_ in the Russian Federation: current epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment from a federal reference center perspective. Int J Infect Dis. 2014 Jun;23:47-52. doi: 10.1016/j.ijid.2014.02.008).
