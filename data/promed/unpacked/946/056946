A poultry farm with 12 000 birds has been hit by avian influenza in Milheeze in Noord-Brabant (North Brabant). There are 3 poultry houses at the farm with outdoor access.

The low-pathogenic H5 variant has been identified. Because a low-pathogenic (mild) H5 variant can mutate to a highly pathogenic variant that is deadly for poultry, according to European rules, depopulation of the farm has been carried out by the Dutch Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (NVWA).

From 3 Apr 2015, there has been a complete ban on the transporting poultry, eggs, poultry manure and used bedding within a radius of [1] km of the Milheeze farm. There is no sign of the disease at the only other poultry farm within that area.

[During 2015, the Netherlands experienced 2 LPAI outbreaks in poultry, of which one, in Gelderland (Centre-East), started 11 Mar 2015, caused by LPAI H7N7, affecting 26 373 layer hens (all destroyed). The other, in Friesland (north), started 25 Mar 2015, caused by LPAI H7 (so far, no further serology notified), affecting 22 273 free-range layer hens, all destroyed. Both outbreaks are currently regarded as "continuing" according to the OIE data.

The current new outbreak, in North-Brabant (southern Netherlands) has reportedly been caused by another LPAI serotype, namely H5. Completed serotyping is anticipated.

The 3 recent LPAI outbreaks in Dutch poultry may be related to migrating birds. LPAI outbreaks in domestic poultry have also been recently reported by other European countries, such as Germany, the UK, and Italy, seemingly independently.

The global spread of avian influenza by migrating birds has recently been addressed in the following paper; commendable reading.
