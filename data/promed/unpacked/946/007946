Brazil: bats attack 140 people in Viseu; one confirmed rabies case
------------------------------------------------------------------
According to the executive secretary of health, Fernando Dourado, who had
spoken to 250 of the 300 inhabitants of Fermiana e Curupati, 2 1/2 hours
from Viseu township [Para state], almost half (140) have been attacked by
bats in the last 12 months. None of them had been to the health post to get
antirabies serum or vaccine. So far, one death due to rabies has been
recorded, along with 4 suspect deaths and 16 people admitted to hospital
with symptoms. But now all the inhabitants of the two localities are being
vaccinated, with a series of 5 doses. Dogs and cats are also being
vaccinated there. More than 130 bats have been captured and 5 per cent of
those will be tested for rabies.
One patient arrived at the hospital on 13 May 2004 with paralyzed legs and
is now in a coma and on a ventilator. Seven other patients ranging in age
from 11 to 49 years are in stable condition and will be discharged in the
next few hours. Only one of them had been bitten by a bat; agricultural
pesticide poisoning was suspected to be the cause of the symptoms. [They
could not have had rabies, because nobody recovers after symptoms appear. -

[This incident may be related to the vampire bat-associated rabies reported
in the Para state of Brazil last month; see the ProMED-mail references
below. The Amazonian region of Brazil and Peru experience periodic
outbreaks of rabies associated with vampire bats. In a 1995 PAHO document
<http://www.paho.org/english/sha/epibul_95-98/be951rabies.htm> vampire bat
rabies is identified as an important public health and economic concern in
Latin America, French Guinea, Guyana, Suriname and Trinidad and Tobago.
From 1989 to 1995, 73 human deaths were attributed to rabies transmitted
by vampire bats. - Mods.MPP/CP]
