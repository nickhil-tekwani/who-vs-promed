Cats are spreading a nasty fungal infection to people in Brazil. The fungal species _Sporothrix brasiliensis_ is spreading quickly among cats and has reached neighboring countries in South America, raising concerns within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Veterinarians appear to be at higher risk for the disease than members of the general public.

Dr Brendan Jackson, medical officer with CDC's Mycotic Diseases Branch, said sporotrichosis had been an obscure disease in Brazil 20 years ago. It's now a serious problem in Rio de Janeiro and other Brazilian cities. "They're seeing thousands of cases, tens of thousands of cases, and that's on a scale unlike we have seen for the classical sporothrix," he said.

_Sporothrix schenckii_ is found throughout the world, including the US. It causes "rose gardener's disease", a rare infection mostly linked to cuts and scrapes that are exposed to soil and plants. It can cause slow-healing lesions and, less often, respiratory infections or generalized infections with joint pain, headache, or seizures.

Dr Jackson said _S. brasiliensis_ appears to cause more severe disease than other _Sporothrix_ species, with skin infections spreading to lymph nodes and, in immunocompromised people, causing lesions throughout the body. The most severe disseminated infections can be fatal without antifungal treatment. [This seems to be in cats and some people. - Mod.TG]

Dr John Rossow is an epidemic intelligence service officer with the Mycotic Diseases Branch and has worked with veterinarians and physicians who saw the disease in Brazil. He said cats pick up fungal spores with their paw pads and spread them to other cats through scratches and bites, resulting in lesions often located on the face. In Brazil, the infections in cats are known as "clown nose" because of the swollen, infected scratches and nasal mucosa lesions. "It can get pretty extensive and not just be isolated to the face," Dr Rossow said.

The infection can be deadly for cats, and treatment tends to be lengthy and difficult, he said. Brazil has large populations of feral cats and owned cats that spend time outside. Veterinarians are among the people most likely to be exposed, usually through bites and scratches, Dr Rossow said. Dr Jackson noted veterinarians have developed eye infections after cats shook during examination of their facial lesions.

In a January 2017 article in PLoS Pathogens, "Zoonotic epidemic of sporotrichosis: cat to human transmission," researchers wrote _S. brasiliensis_ had higher virulence than other _Sporothrix_ species during epizootics, and it tended to escalate to outbreaks or epidemics among cats. From 1997 to 2011, Brazil's main referral center for mycosis treatment recorded about 4200 cases of sporotrichosis involving humans, the article states. Treatment tends to require long-term antifungal administration, and researchers have found drug resistance with increasing frequency.

Dr Jackson said _S. brasiliensis_ seems to have come from an environmental reservoir in far southern Brazil, and the various strains spreading among cats seem to be close relatives. But he said CDC is trying to learn more about those origins. Dr Rossow said CDC also is trying to learn more about the potential that people could bring the fungus to the US. Even a US veterinary student participating in a spay-and-neuter program, for example, could bring home a healthy cat with paw pads colonized by fungal spores. Dr Rossow said veterinarians should be vigilant against this disease. Cats with the disease can have facial lesions and wounds that are slow to heal, and impression smears or other in-house diagnostic testing could reveal yeasts. He suggests veterinarians tell diagnostic laboratories to keep _S. schenckii_ and _S. brasiliensis_ on the differential list. Veterinarians who need testing help from CDC can send a message to <pathology@cdc.gov>, Dr Rossow said.

In December [2018], Dr Jackson also said during a CDC Zoonoses & One Health Updates presentation that sporothrix is unusual for its ability to spread in both mold and yeast forms, as well as its transmission from animals to people. He called for more study on disease spread and better testing methods in case of an outbreak. If this fungus is neglected, it will grow, he said.

[A visit to the original website shows a photo of a cat with a lesion on the nose. The photo demonstrates why this horrible disease is called "clown nose". It looks painful and awful, and clearly from this article it is serious for cats and humans. It should also be noted that _Sporothrix brasiliensis_ has a much higher virulence than _Sporothrix schenckii_ and other clades within the _Sporothrix_ genus.

Sporotrichosis is a mycotic infectious disease generally acquired by traumatic inoculation of contaminated materials especially from plant debris or through bites and scratches from diseased animals, such as domestic cats, or between cats. It affects the skin, lymphatic system, and other organs in the warm-blooded host https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2045377/.

_S. brasiliensis_ has emerged as a human threat owing to the intimate contact pattern between diseased cats and humans in endemic areas. Sporotrichosis outbreaks with zoonotic transmission, such as those that are ongoing in southern and southeastern Brazil, have highlighted the threat of cross-species pathogen transmission.

The fast spread of sporotrichosis in a short period highlights the potential for outbreaks and suggests that the mycosis may affect an urban population with a high concentration of susceptible felines. The feline sporotrichosis epidemic shows no signs of slowing, and this epidemiological pattern may require specific public health strategies to control future outbreaks. This particular outbreak likely started in 2011.

The cat-cat contact pattern during fights and the cat-human contact pattern of scratches and bites may also support the success of horizontal disease transmission in a short period because the fungus does not die with the feline, and can be transmitted to the next warm-blooded host. The increased proximity between cats and humans favors the emergence of sporotrichosis in Brazil and possibly other locations.

This disease deserves serious attention for cats and for humans. This disease has also been documented to be in some dogs.

Portions of this have been extracted from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4244058/, which also provides much more information about this disease, including a number of photos of cats and not only the spreading lesions but also the severe weight loss these animals experience as a result of this devastating disease.

This article and the various research papers should serve a loud warning: this disease is on the move, and currently shows no signs of abating, and has been spreading. - Mod.TG
