According to the Preventive Health Department under the Ministry of Health,
7 people have died of viral encephalitis in the country in the last month.
A total of 120 people have been infected so far in 15 provinces and cities
including Ha Noi and HCM City and Nam Dinh, Bac Giang, Nghe An, Thanh Hoa,
Dak Lak, and Dong Nai.

Dr Tran Nhu Duong, deputy head of the National Institute of Hygiene and
Epidemiology, said the disease usually spreads most rapidly in both the
north and south between May and August. The northern provinces had reported
the highest incidence, he said.

Japanese encephalitis [JE] is a very common disease among children aged
under 15, with the fatality rate topping 30 per cent if patients are not
treated in time. Duong dispelled a misconception that eating litchi causes
the disease, explaining it is caused by a virus or hypersensitivity to a
virus or foreign protein. "Mosquitoes spread the virus responsible for
encephalitis," he said.

[There is no indication in this report of vaccination programs in Viet Nam
to prevent clinical cases of JE virus infection. JE virus is a flavivirus
related to St. Louis encephalitis and West Nile viruses. It is the major
cause of viral encephalitis in Asia; 10-50 000 cases are reported annually.
JE virus is maintained in an enzootic cycle in South East Asia involving
the _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_ group of mosquitoes and wild birds. Vector
control is difficult due to extensive breeding sites of the mosquitoes
involved in transmission. Ardeid wading birds and pigs are amplifying
vertebrate hosts. In endemic areas, incidence in humans is 1-10 per 10 000
population. Children under 15 years of age are at greatest risk of
encephalitis. Summaries of JE virus, its epidemiology, and available
vaccines can be found on the United States Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention website at <http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5901a1.htm>.
