Just a few years ago, the once-threatened Lake Erie water snake defied the odds and became a poster child for species recovery.

Now, it faces a new foe: snake fungal disease, a condition typically characterized by scabs or crusty scales, premature separation of a snake's outermost skin layer, white opaque cloudiness of the eyes, thickening of the skin, swelling of the face, skin ulcers, lesions, and other problems.

While the disease appears unlikely to throw those snakes back on the threatened or endangered species list, the fungus certainly has the potential to sicken them and slow down their progress.

Snake fungal disease is not limited to the Lake Erie water snake: According to the U.S. Geological Survey, it is emerging among several groups of wild snakes in the East, South, and Midwest.

Though believed to be more widespread than documented, the suspected fungal pathogen associated with skin lesions has been found in 9 states: Ohio, Illinois, Florida, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Tennessee, and Wisconsin.

The Lake Erie water snake is found only on the Lake Erie islands or in water near them.

During a recent gathering with journalists at Ohio State University's Stone Laboratory on Gibraltar Island, a tiny research island OSU owns near Put-in-Bay, Ohio, Sea Grant and OSU Stone Lab snake researcher Kristin Stanford said she is hopeful the fungus won't hurt Lake Erie water snake populations in the long term but is worried about what might happen if the disease intensifies.

"Pathologically, what it's doing inside to cause death we just don't know," Ms. Stanford said, adding that it is as mysterious as the dreaded white nose syndrome which has killed millions of bats.

Several Lake Erie water snakes brought into Stone Laboratory have died within a day or 2, she said.

"It's concerning because you put forth all of this effort to achieve recovery, and now this happens," Ms. Stanford said.

Researchers acknowledge, though, that the Lake Erie water snake might have been living with snake fungal disease to some degree while its recovery was in progress.

The 1st known case of the disease presented itself in a sick Lake Erie water snake in 2009, 4 years before the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service put out a nationwide bulletin telling people to be on the lookout for symptoms among snakes in general.

But even as far back as the 1980s, snake researchers noticed something they called "hibernation blisters," Ms. Stanford said. It's possible that might have been an early warning sign of the disease emerging, but hard to tell, she said.

"It's not abnormal to look bad after 7 months of hibernation," Ms. Stanford said.

A treatment for the disease shows promise, although it may be impractical to apply beyond selected groups of any snake species.

"I'm hoping it's not affecting long-term population trends," Ms. Stanford said. "It is still a concern. We don't know how it's functioning on a larger scale in the snake population."

Sarah Bailey, a University of Virginia graduate assisting Ms. Stanford at Stone Laboratory, said she has seen several cases of Lake Erie water snakes with white opaque cloudiness of the eyes, including one she examined while the group of visiting journalists was there.

"A lot [of the impacted Lake Erie water snakes] go blind," Ms. Bailey said.

Ms. Bailey demonstrated how she and other researchers inject a device called a "pit tag" into some healthy water snakes they capture. It's a microchip about the size of a grain of rice, each with a unique letter code. That allows researchers to scan them like bar codes on supermarket products, retrieving information that helps them track snake distribution and learn more about their habits.

Lake Erie water snakes were classified as a federally threatened species from 30 Aug 1999 to 16 Aug 2011, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

Only 1300 were believed to exist in 1984. About 1500 to 2000 existed when the snakes were formally listed as endangered in 1999.

Today, the population is estimated to be between 10 000 to 12 000, a figure that has stayed relatively stable the last 6 years. Their diet is now 90 percent round gobies, an exotic from Eastern Europe that has established strong populations in Lake Erie, even with once-endangered birds such as cormorants feeding on them too.

Ms. Stanford attributes their demise to anxiety people have about snakes in general.

As the Lake Erie islands were becoming developed, people did virtually anything to kill snakes that crossed their paths.

They would dig them up during hibernation, pour gasoline on them and set fire to nests of them.

They used them for target practice. Many cut their heads off with shovels.

"Pretty much everything and anything, people were going out of their way to kill them," Ms. Stanford said. "There are a lot of people out there who just don't like snakes."

She called the mass killings of Lake Erie water snakes "one of the most well-reported instances of population decline through purposeful human persecution of any snake out there."

The recovery was possible because of a well-orchestrated education and outreach campaign spearheaded by Ms. Stanford, who for years has been affectionately referred to as the "Island Snake Lady."

[Snake fungal disease (SFD) is an emerging disease of wild snakes in the eastern and midwestern USA, recently also found in Canada. Recently, an experimental study reproduced the skin lesions observed in the field and confirmed that the etiologic agent is the fungus _Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola_. This fungus had been consistently associated with the often-fatal skin, face, and eye lesions characteristic of the disease. In recent years, cases of this fungal infection have been increasing.

A picture of the lesions observed in snakes with SFD can be seen at http://mongabay-images.s3.amazonaws.com/13/0906snake2.jpg.

The Lake Erie water snake is a subspecies of the Northern water snake (_Nerodia siperon_). The Lake Erie water snake was delisted from the federal threatened and endangered species list in 2011, but it is still a threatened species within the state of Ohio. This snake has one of the smallest geographic ranges of any vertebrate in the world and is only found on the islands of Lake Erie.
