Measles alert for GPs, emergency departments
--------------------------------------------
Overview
--------
The Department of Health (DH) has been notified of 2 confirmed cases
of measles in travellers who returned from South Africa on 3 Aug 2010.

With an average incubation period of 10 to 14 days until onset of
rash, secondary cases may now be appearing.

Children or adults born during or since 1966 who do not have
documented evidence of receiving 2 doses of a measles containing
vaccine or documented evidence of laboratory confirmed measles are
considered to be highly susceptible to measles.

Measles case definition
-----------------------
The public health definition for suspected measles is an illness
characterised by:
- morbilliform rash; and
- cough; and
- fever present at the time of rash onset.

Recommendations
---------------
1. Think measles in patients who present with a febrile rash illness
2. Notify any patient that you suspect could have measles immediately
to the Communicable Disease Prevention and Control Unit
3. Take blood for serological confirmation and a nose and throat swab
for PCR diagnosis.
4. Minimise transmission:
- Be alert for new measles cases -- make sure all staff,
particularly triage nurses, have a high index of suspicion for
patients presenting with a febrile rash illness
- If other patients are in the waiting room when they arrive, give
the suspected case a mask and take the suspected measles case
directly to a consulting room. (That room should not be used for
another patient for at least 2 hours after the consultation)
5. In general practice
- See suspected measles patients at home if possible
- If not possible, make their appointment the last of the day to
minimise contact with other patients in the waiting room
- If a patient needs to be sent to hospital, telephone ahead and
let the Emergency Department staff know that you are referring a case
of suspected measles
6. Seek advice from the Department of Health regarding the management
of susceptible contacts:
- On DH advice, follow up all persons who have been in the waiting
room at the same time as a case and for 2 hours after the visit.
These people are considered to be exposed to the measles virus
To prevent measles in susceptible contacts give:
- MMR if within 72 hours of 1st contact with the patient or
- Immunoglobulin if longer than 72 hours but within 6 days from contact.
7. Check vaccination records for:
- Your staff -- All staff born during or since 1966 should have
documentation of 2 doses of measles containing vaccine.
- Your patients -- Ideally all patients born during or since 1966
should have received 2 doses of a measles-containing vaccine.
Currently MMR vaccine is recommended on the National Immunisation
Program at 12 months and 4 years of age. The vaccine is free as a
catch up for children and adolescents of school age only.

[This is the 3rd occurrence this year (2010) of importation into
Australia of measles virus infection from South Africa. An outbreak
in Argentina earlier in the year was also an introduction from South
Africa. These introductions may be due to increased travel to and
from South Africa as a consequence of the FIFA (Federation
Internationale de Football Association) World Cup which took place in
South Africa from 11 Jun to 11 Jul 2010.

Travel-related importations of measles virus infection has been a
constant feature of ProMED-mail reports. Since 1999 there have been
70 reports, with a changing pattern of countries of origin reflecting
local fluctuations in disease control and social instability.
