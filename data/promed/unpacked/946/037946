I did query with our regulators in Brisbane, who dealt with the
matter, re- the last moderator comment on ProMED-mail Hendra virus,
human, equine - Australia (05): (QLD) 20080816.2548, and received the
response below, which you may wish to circulate.

In response to yours, ProMED's, and others 'interest' in the
euthanasia of the sero-positive Hendra horse, the CVO [chief
veterinary officer] for QLD has provided the following response for
distribution as you like.

Thank you for your email regarding the decision to put down the horse
that recovered from Hendra virus [HeV] at the Redlands Veterinary
Clinic. We have received a number of emails on this topic, so I will
attempt to address most issues that have been raised.

Firstly, this was a really tough decision and I can certainly
understand why people would question why it should be put down and
why it couldn't be kept alive for further study.

Secondly, I need to emphasize that this is one of the most deadly
viruses known to man. It has a mortality rate in horses of over 70
percent. Not counting the current people in hospital, 50 percent of
previous human cases have died. It is a high-level containment
category virus that is only studied in laboratories under the
strictest of biocontainment protocols. Hence, it is not something to
play around with.

While the national policy for Hendra virus is, and has always been,
that blood test positive horses should be put down, we did take the
time to review this policy in this case. We also seriously considered
the option of long-term quarantine and monitoring of the surviving
horse. However we came to the final view that it should be put down
largely based on the advice of medical authorities that it was not
worth the risk to human life (particularly the people caring for the
horse). This is a highly fatal disease and we know that there is a
real risk that it can reappear in an infected animal at a later time.
It was considered that the human health and safety considerations
must come first.

This decision was supported by chief veterinary officers from all
States and the Commonwealth, the head of the Australian Animal Health
Laboratory in Geelong, the Australian Racing Board, the Australian
Horse Industry Council, the Federal Department of Health and Ageing,
Queensland Health, and the Australian Veterinary Association.

In making this decision, it was also noted that the actual
information to be gleaned from longer term monitoring the horse would
be relatively limited. However we will learn as much as possible from
this horse. People from the Australian Animal Health Laboratory
attended the autopsy and a wide range of tissues was collected for
further analysis.

There are 2 primary pieces of evidence indicating that Hendra virus
infection may remain dormant in the body and re-appear at a later time:

1. There was a human death from HeV infection in 1995, where the
person contracted the infection approximately 12 months earlier, had
a mild infection at the time, appeared to recover, but later
succumbed to the disease.

2. Nipah virus is a closely related virus causing mortalities in
people in Asia. The ability of this virus to become active again
after a dormant period has been well documented in around 10 percent
of cases and occurs up to 2-3 years following initial infection.
Approximately 18 percent of these cases are fatal.

The tissues taken from the autopsy already mentioned will be tested
to try to identify whether the virus could be lying dormant in any of
them. If detected, further laboratory work will try to show whether
any such virus is viable or not.

So, while Tamworth [horse's name] may have appeared to be well, the
disease could re-appear at any time.

Some people have asked whether this horse could be useful in work
towards developing a vaccine for Hendra virus. The basic research
that could lead to production of a vaccine has already been conducted
and a vaccine is possible. A recovered horse would not make any
further contribution to vaccine research. The main issue regarding
production of a vaccine will be whether it would be commercially
viable. This is still a very rare disease in a relatively limited
part of the world and drug companies tend to only develop vaccines
that will get sold widely. A possibility would be development of a
vaccine that protected for both Hendra virus and Nipah virus, as this
would have much broader application.

Similarly we have been asked about the possibility of breeding from
this horse so that the antibodies it has developed could be passed on
to other horses. Firstly, there is nothing unusual about some animals
having an innate resistance to infection, fighting off the infection,
and subsequently developing antibodies. This happens with all
diseases, but the antibodies are not passed on to their offspring,
except temporarily through the mother's milk. The innate resistance
factors that Tamworth had may or may not have been heritable. However
he was a gelding, so this would not have been possible in any case.

Finally, the presence of a live sero-positive horse in Queensland
could lead some of our trading partners to interpret that Hendra
virus infection is present in Queensland horses. They may then feel
justified to exclude Queensland horses from future horse trade
between the countries, which will potentially have a wide impact on
the whole horse industry.

I hope this helps you to understand the issues in relation to this matter.

[We appreciate Ann and Ron both for their response. It is surprising
that the lab at Geelong could not put the animal in containment for
further study. - Mod.TG]
