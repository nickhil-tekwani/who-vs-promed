Abstract
--------
A large epidemic of chikungunya fever currently affects the Caribbean, Central and South America. Despite a high number of reported cases, little is known on the occurrence of severe clinical complications. We describe 4 Venezuelan patients with a severe and/or lethal course who exhibit unusual manifestations of the disease.

Case 1 describes a 75 year-old man with rapid onset of septic shock and multi-organ failure. Case 2 and 3 describe 2 patients with rapid aggressive clinical course who developed shock, severe purpuric lesions and a distinct area large of necrosis in the nasal region. Case 4 depicts a splenectomized woman with shock, generalized purpuric lesions, bullous dermatosis and acronecrosis of an upper limb.

Chikungunya fever in the Western hemisphere may also associate with atypical and severe manifestations. Some patients experience a life-threatening, aggressive clinical course, with rapid deterioration and death due to multisystem failure.

Pacific
French Polynesia. 5 Jan 2015. (estimated) more than 200 000 cases. Although the peak of the epidemic was reached in Tahiti and Moorea, some patients still complain of joint pains, that is what is called subacute or chronic form. The archipelagos have not been spared by the virus. In the Isles-Sous-le-Vent, chikungunya arrived at the same time as the Hawaiki Nui Va'a canoe race last November [2014], compounded by the school holiday period. The peak was reached in Tahiti and Moorea in week 48, i.e. early December 2014. Consultations decreased during the holidays, but the health surveillance team expects a rebound in January [2015]. At Uturoa, more than half of the population suffers from the disease.

[The number of cases in French Polynesia is increasing rapidly. The 14 Dec 2014 post (ProMED-mail archive no. 20141215.3033248) reported that there were 35 000 cases, and 3 weeks later the estimated case number is nearly 3 times that.
