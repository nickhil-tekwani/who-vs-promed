EHRLICHIOSIS, HUMAN GRANULOCYTIC - SWEDEN

Since 1994 and the first description of a case of human granulocytic
ehrlichiosis (HGE), focus has been set on HGE as a new emerging infection.
Only recently was the first case in Europe reported from Slovenia. However,
granulocytotropic Ehrlichiae has been recognised for decades as the cause of
clinical disease in cattle, sheep, dogs and horses in Scandinavia.
Serological data from tick-exposed populations indicates a seroprevalence of
approximately 10% in humans in Sweden. In this letter we present three
verified cases of HGE from Sweden.
Patient 1: A 5-year-old girl presented in August 1996 with a five-day
history of headache, fever and a left-sided facial palsy. Borrelia serology
showed seroconversion and intrathecal antibody production. The _Ehrlichia
equi_ serology was negative at presentation. She was diagnosed as
neuroborreliosis, and received treatment with iv. ceftriaxone. The treatment
had no effect on the fever, and she gradually developed a marked
neutropenia, which lasted for several months.
Patient 2: A 41-year-old man, previously healthy and often engaged in
outdoor activities. He presented in October 1997 with fever, cough,
dyspnoea, headache, conjunctivitis and a rash. Laboratory analyses showed
slightly elevated transaminases and chest X-ray revealed discrete pulmonary
infiltrates. The patient recovered rapidly upon doxycycline treatment. At
presentation the IFA anti _Ehrlichia_ equi titre was already 1:1260.
Patient 3: A 32-year-old woman, a previously healthy farmer, presented in
August 1997 with five days duration of fever, chills, headache and a
slightly stiff neck. She had observed several tick-bites during the month
preceding her illness. Routine laboratory analyses were normal except for a
low platelet count. She recovered slowly without treatment within 3 weeks
and reported no complaints when followed up seven months later. _Ehrlichia
equi serology_ was negative at presentation.
All three cases were verified retrospectively by PCR. Genomic DNA was
extracted from whole-blood and the DNA templates were amplified in a nested
16S rDNA PCR and in a groESL Heat Shock Operon PCR assay. Both assays were
positive for all three patients. The sequences of the 16S rDNA PCR products
(base no [number?] 36-613 corresponding base number designations for the
HGE agent 16S
rDNA) from the patients were identical or 99,9% identical to the
corresponding sequences of PCR products from clinical cases of GE in horses
and dogs in Sweden and to the HGE agent reported from there and [from]
Slovenia.
This is the first report of verified cases of HGE from northern Europe. Our
findings should alert physicians to consider this diagnosis in tick-exposed
patients. In addition, it stresses the importance of considering _Borrelia_
and _Ehrlichia_ co-infection.

the 3 patients? (2) What was the nature of the negative controls performed
for the PCR analysis? - Mod.ES]
