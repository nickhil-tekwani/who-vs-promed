Malaysia: New HFMD cases in Sarawak
-----------------------------------
The Sarawak Health Department yesterday [16 Jul 2006] detected 44 new
cases of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD), including 10 children
hospitalized throughout the state. Deputy Chief Minister Tan Sri Dr
George Chan said 3 of the children were admitted to the Miri
Hospital, 2 in Bintulu and one in the Sarawak General Hospital
here. "However, none of them are critically ill," Dr. Chan, who is
also the State Disaster and Relief Management Committee Chairman,
said in his daily HFMD updates. He said 16 new cases were reported in
Miri, Sibu (11), Bintulu (8), Kuching (4), Saramarah (2) and the rest
from other divisions.
With the latest figures, HFMD infections have affected 12 035
children and claimed 11 lives, including 3 confirmed to be
enterovirus 71 (EV71) positive, since the outbreak in Sibu.
Two kindergartens in Miri -- Prasekolah Sekolah Kebangsaan Senadin
and Tadika T&W in Pujut -- were ordered to shut down on Tuesday and
Wednesday [11,12 Jul 2006?] for 2 weeks after 2 or more cases were
reported.
The disease hit the state twice this year [2006], the 1st wave on 29
Jan and the 2nd on 7 May 2006.

[This epidemic continues unabated. The report confirms that the agent
responsible for the current HFMD outbreak in Sarawak is likely to be
enterovirus 71, which in the past in south East Asia has been
responsible for life-threatening disease in a minority of children.
In the current outbreak, enterovirus 71 infection has been confirmed
in 3 of the 11 fatal cases.
