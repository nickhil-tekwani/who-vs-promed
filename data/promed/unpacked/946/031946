RIBAVIRIN, AVAILABILITY
=======================
Date: Sat, March 8, 1997 09:50:00 MST
From: Charles Calisher <ccalisher@vines.colostate.edu>
Two recent postings, on Lassa fever and ribavirin treatment for Lassa fever,
have prompted the comments below. I am certain that some of my questions are
naive but I would be grateful if someone, perhaps someone in the Food and
Drug Administration or someone with the distributor of ribavirin, would
respond to them.

ProMED-mail has not had the opportunity to post very much on the subject of
availability of drugs for emerging infections, although this, as is the
vaccine issue for Lassa fever, is important. Most viruses of the families
Arenaviridae (lymphocytic choriomeningitis, Machupo, Junin, Guanarito, Sabia
and other arenaviruses) and Bunyaviridae (Rift Valley fever, Hantaan, and
other bunyaviruses) are sensitive to ribavirin in cell culture and it is
clear that in some cases the pathogenesis of the disease lends itself to
ribavirin use in vivo.
The arenavirus hemorrhagic fevers have a clinical course lasting several
days, with viremia throughout the acute phase, making them ideal candidates
for drug therapy. Studies of Lassa fever using retrospective controls
have shown that intravenous ribavirin was effective (McCormick JB, King IJ,
Webb PA, Scribner CL, Craven RB, Johnson KM, Elliott LH, Belmont-Williams R
[1986] Lassa fever. Effective therapy with ribavirin. New Engl. J. Med.
314:20-26) and anecdotal data from the South American hemorrhagic fevers is
very suggestive and encouraging (Enria D, Maiztegui JI [1994] Antiviral
treatment of Argentine hemorrhagic fever. Antivir. Res. 23:23 31; Barry M,
Russi M, Armstrong L, Geller D, Tesh R, Dembry L, Gonzalez JP, Khan AS,
Peters CJ [1995] Treatment of a laboratory-acquired Sabia virus infection.
New Engl. J. Med. 333:294-296).
The efficacy of ribavirin is not as clear with viruses of the family
Bunyaviridae. In South Africa the drug is routinely used to treat Crimean-
Congo hemorrhagic fever, apparently with good results. Statistically
significant improvement was obtained in treatment of hemorrhagic fever with
renal syndrome in China (Huggins JW, Hsiang CM, Cosgriff TM, Guang MY, Smith
JI, Wu ZO, LeDuc JW, Zheng ZM, Meegan JM, Wang QN, Oland DD, Gui XE, Gibbs
PH, Yuan GH, Zhang TM [1991] Prospective, double-blind concurrent, placebo-
controlled, clinical trial of intravenous ribavirin therapy of hemorrhagic
fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). J. Infect. Dis. 164:1119-1127), but a trial
with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (caused by Sin Nombre hantavirus) did not
indicate a great deal of efficacy and has led the US National Institutes of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases to sponsor a randomized double-blind trial to
reevaluate ribavirin for that disease.
So, therapy with ribavirin given intravenously has considerable utility in
some of these dangerous infections and, of these, at least Lassa fever has a
significant annual incidence.
My questions are these:
1. The drug is a simple nucleoside analogue and thus might not be too
expensive to produce. Are there ProMED-mail readers who can comment on why
the drug is unlicensed, why the supply of ribavirin soon will be depleted,
and why, in general, ribavirin has such limited availability?
2. Are there mechanisms for remedying this situation?
3. Whose responsibility is it to do so?
4. What route of administration is most efficacious, intravenous or
aerosol? What are the comparative costs of administration by these routes?
Of course, if the drug is not available, questions about the route of
administration are merely hypothetical.
5. In the first recent Lassa fever outbreak report posted on ProMED-mail
(Lassa fever - Sierra Leone, archive 970307120747), Dr. Simon Mardel of the
British aid agency Medical Emergency Relief International was quoted as
saying that "The only known cure, ribavirin, a costly drug previously donated
by the United States, is no longer produced there. We have only one week's
supply left. We are now looking for another source, maybe China or Russia."
Here we have a drug we know is effective against numerous viruses that cause
life-threatening illnesses and, disgracefully, it is neither licensed nor
readily and cheaply available in the US, which has international
responsibilities as well as the responsibilities for maintaining the good
health of laboratory and field workers who study these viruses. As Hawkeye
Pierce might have said, "Who's in charge here"?
