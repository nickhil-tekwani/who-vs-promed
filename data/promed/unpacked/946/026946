"Post surgery the dog is receiving more prednisone, antibiotics, and ivermectin (heartworm preventive). If necessary the dog will also receive an anti-parasitic agent (immiticide), identical to the one given to humans for river blindness [onchocerciasis] in Africa to kill off any remaining adult worms." [This statement was sent by the correspondent. - Mod.TG]

Immiticide (melarsomine) is an arsenical antiparasitic drug used in the treatment of canine heartworm disease to kill the adult worms living in the heart. It is NOT for human use and any human exposure requires contacting a physician. Also, immiticide is currently unavailable (or at the very least, available on a very restricted basis).

I think the author meant that the dog will be on ivermectin (which is used in the treatment of onchocerciasis).

[Dr Colley is correct. I apologize for not catching the slip. Ivermectin is used in dogs as a heartworm prevention, as a treatment for onchocerciasis and has been used in humans for various parasitic diseases. - Mod.TG
