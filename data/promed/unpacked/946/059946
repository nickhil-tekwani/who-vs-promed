Ebola situation report - as of 10 May 2015
------------------------------------
Summary
-------

A total of 9 confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) was reported in the week to 10 May [2015]: the lowest weekly total this year. Guinea reported a total of 7 cases, Sierra Leone reported 2. For the first time since the beginning of the outbreak in Sierra Leone, the country reported 0 confirmed cases for more than 2 consecutive days in the week to 10 May [2015]. As at 12 May, Sierra Leone has reported 8 consecutive days without a confirmed case.

***The EVD outbreak in Liberia was declared over on 9 May [2015], after 42 complete days [twice the max. incubation period] elapsed since the burial of the last confirmed case. The country has now entered a 3-month period of heightened vigilance. WHO will maintain an enhanced presence in the country until the end of 2015, with a particular focus on areas that border Guinea and Sierra Leone.***[asterisks by ProMED]

***Of 55 districts in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone that have reported one or more confirmed cases of EVD since the outbreak began, 43 have not reported a case for over 6 weeks.***

Of the 7 confirmed cases reported from Guinea, 6 were reported from the prefecture of Forecariah, which has been the focus of transmission for several weeks. Of those 6 cases, 4 were reported from the central sub-prefecture of Moussayah, which borders the Sierra Leonean district of Kambia. Kaliah and Sikhourou, the sub-prefectures to the west and north-east of Moussayah, respectively, each reported 1 confirmed case. The remaining case in Guinea was reported from Dubreka prefecture. The case was identified post mortem in a community setting. Investigations have as yet been unable to establish a link with a previously reported case.

In total, 4 of the 7 cases reported from Guinea in the week to 10 May [2015] were identified after post-mortem testing. One of the 7 cases was a registered contact of a previously reported case. A total of 529 laboratory samples were tested in the week to 10 May [2015], although this total includes both initial and repeat testing. The number of reported unsafe burials declined for a 3rd consecutive week, to 23 out of 368 reported community deaths. These indicators suggest that tracking transmission chains is still challenging, and there remains a possibility of an increase in case incidence and/or geographical spread in coming weeks. The absence of an established epidemiological link between the case in Dubreka and a known chain of transmission is of particular concern. Preliminary reports from the prefecture since 10 May [2015] indicate that the case has resulted in at least 3 additional confirmed cases.

Both cases reported from Sierra Leone occurred in the Moa Wharf area of the East 1 Chiefdom of the capital, Freetown. The cases are a mother and her 10-year old daughter, both of whom are known contacts of a previous case in the Moa Wharf area, and were under quarantine at the time of symptom onset. After treatment at the Ebola Treatment Centre in Hastings, the mother has now tested negative for EVD for a 2nd time. The daughter is still EVD-positive and remains in treatment.

***For the 4th consecutive week, no health worker infections were reported in the week to 10 May [2015].***

There have been a total of 868 confirmed health worker infections reported from Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone since the start of the outbreak, with 507 reported deaths.

***However, on 12 May [2015] WHO received notification of a laboratory-confirmed EVD case in Italy.***

The case is a volunteer health worker who returned to Italy from Sierra Leone on 7 May [2015]. The patient developed symptoms on 10 May [2015], and was transported on 11 May [2015] to the infectious diseases ward of the Hospital of Sassari, Sardinia. Clinical samples were confirmed as EVD positive on 12 May [2015], and the patient was securely transferred to the National Institute for Infectious Diseases in Rome. Because onset of symptoms occurred 72 hours after the case's last flight, contact tracing of passengers who shared flights with the case is not considered necessary.

Countries with widespread and intense transmission
----------------------------------------------
There have been a total of 26 724 reported confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of EVD in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone (figure 1, table 1), with 11 065 reported deaths (this total includes reported deaths among probable and suspected cases, although outcomes for many cases are unknown). A total of 7 new confirmed cases were reported in Guinea and 2 in Sierra Leone in the 7 days to 10 May [2015]. The outbreak in Liberia was declared over on 9 May [2015].

The total number of confirmed cases is similar in males and females (table 2). Compared with children (people aged 14 years and under), people aged 15 to 44 are approximately 3 to 4 times more likely to be affected. People aged 45 and over are 4 to 5 times more likely to be affected than children.

A total of 868 confirmed health worker infections have been reported in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone; there have been 507 reported deaths [among them] (table 5).

[3] ECDC update
Date: 11 May 2015
Source: European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa. 11th update - 11 May 2015.
http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/risk-assessment-Ebola%20update%2011.pdf

Outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa 11th update, 11 May 2015
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Developments since the 10th update: As of 8 May 2015, WHO has reported 26 683 cases, including 11 022 deaths, linked to the West African epidemic of Ebola virus disease (EVD) with onset in December 2013. 9 countries have reported EVD cases. Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone have experienced widespread and intense transmission. Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Spain, the United Kingdom and the USA have at some point reported imported cases or import-related local transmission linked to the epidemic in West Africa, but all 6 countries have been declared Ebola-free.

Guinea and Sierra Leone still report cases whereas Liberia has not reported a confirmed case since 27 March and was declared Ebola-free by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 9 May 2015 after 42 days without confirmed cases [1]. Liberia's last case was a woman in the greater Monrovia area who developed symptoms on 20 March [2015] and died on 27 March [2015].

However, the epidemic is not being controlled at the same pace in the two other countries, and there is a risk that transmission will be reintroduced to areas and countries that have been declared Ebola-free.

The latest WHO report indicates that the number of new cases continues to decrease; 18 cases were reported from Guinea and Sierra Leone for the week leading up to 6 May. This is the lowest weekly number of cases reported in 2015. Sierra Leone and Guinea have reported low number of cases for 5 consecutive weeks.

The geographical area of transmission is shrinking in both Guinea and Sierra Leone. In Guinea the affected area is still larger than in Sierra Leone. Transmission is now concentrated in districts along the Guinean-Sierra Leonean border.

ECDC published a public health development following new evidence related to possible sexual transmission of EVD [2]. WHO published 'Sexual transmission of the Ebola Virus: evidence and knowledge gaps' providing interim advice for the Ebola survivors [3].

The West African EVD epidemic was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by the Director General of WHO on 8 Aug 2014 on the recommendation of the Emergency Committee. The Committee met for the 5th time on 9 Apr 2015 and concluded that the event continues to constitute a PHEIC and recommended that all previous temporary recommendations should be extended. The Committee strongly reiterated the need for continued exit screening in the affected countries for at least 42 days after the last case has twice tested negative for Ebola.

Vaccine-preventable diseases
---------------------
There are now concerns about the risk of outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases in the Ebola-affected countries. The interruption of immunisation activities since the start of the epidemic has resulted in the accumulation of susceptible individuals in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. There is an ongoing outbreak of measles in Guinea, and there is a risk of vaccine-preventable diseases spreading in all 3 countries.

Main conclusions
-------------
The significant drop of EVD cases in West Africa will only continue if control efforts are maintained. A resurgence of the epidemic remains possible. Transmission may continue at low intensity due to incomplete contact tracing and the inadequate management of new infections. Failing to interrupt all chains of human-to-human transmission would have far-reaching consequences for the entire West African region. Surveillance, contact tracing and active case-finding should be strengthened, with the goal of reaching zero cases as soon as possible.

The risk of EVD spreading between affected countries and into the countries sharing borders with Guinea and Sierra Leone will remain as long as transmission continues in these countries because of frequent cross-border movement of people and insufficient Ebola surveillance at some border crossings.

It is expected that the need for repatriation and medical evacuation will decrease as the epidemic continues to decline, and fewer international staff will be engaged in caring for EVD patients. However, continued vigilance is essential in order to ensure that re-entry standards do not lapse.

The risk of EVD being imported into the EU and the risk of transmission from an imported case remains very low as a result of the range of risk reduction measures that have been put in place by the Member States and the affected countries. However, if a symptomatic case of EVD presents in an EU Member State, secondary transmission to caregivers in the family and in healthcare facilities cannot be excluded.

There is a need to consider conducting catch-up vaccination campaigns for measles and polio in order to promptly reduce the risk of outbreaks and re-establish routine childhood immunisation services. It is also urgent to restore public trust in the healthcare system and increase the utilisation of clinical and preventive health services.
