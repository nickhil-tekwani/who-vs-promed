Chikungunya, a viral disease that spreads through the bite of
infected mosquitoes, has struck Kerala again. The 1st cases this year
[2008] have been reported from Kozhikode district. The outbreak was
reported Tuesday [7 Apr 2008], following heavy and untimely rain.
Last year [2007], the disease had ravaged the southern and central
districts of the state. Kozhikode is in Kerala's north.

Chikungunya is characterised by severe, sometimes persistent, joint
pain as well as fever and rash.

"There are 6 confirmed cases in Vatakara and 9 in Maruthonkara," A
Baburaj, district medical officer, told IANS. He said the source of
the outbreak was a person who had travelled to the area from Tamil Nadu.

Baburaj added that the places from where the disease was reported
have a high density of _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes, the carrier of
chikungunya virus.

"Last year [2007] Kozhikode had many chikungunya cases. But we could
contain it. Kodenchery town reported a large number of cases. By
destroying the mosquitoes we stopped the disease from spreading. This
time also we are working hard to destroy the mosquitoes," he said.

The health department has mobilised committees in the affected areas
to conduct a door-to-door campaign to sensitise people about the
disease and destroy the breeding places of mosquitoes. "_Aedes
aegypti_ breeds in clean and fresh water. Water collected in cocoa
leaves and coconut shells are turning into breeding places for the
vector," Baburaj said.

[ProMED-mail hopes that timely and aggressive action to eliminate
_Aedes aegypti_ breeding sites can prevent an outbreak.
