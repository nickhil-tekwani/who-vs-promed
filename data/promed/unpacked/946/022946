Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) is back in New Hampshire, and state
health officials are urging residents to use bug spray.
Eastern Equine Encephalitis is transmitted by mosquitoes and can be deadly.
A dead bird in Concord has tested positive for the disease. So far,
this is the only case in the Granite State. No person in New
Hampshire has become infected with EEE, but there have been human
cases in Massachusetts.
Most people who get EEE suffer flu-like symptoms. But if the
infection gets into the central nervous system, the results are far
worse. 1/3rd of those patients die. Survivors can suffer permanent
brain damage.

[Birds and horses are often the 1st animals to become affected by
EEE. There are vaccines for horses but not for humans. Vaccines for
West Nile virus and for eastern, western and Venezuelan equine
encephalitis are available for horses. These have been combined into
one vaccine. Generally, one or 2 shots will protect the horse from
all of these diseases.
Mosquitoes are generally the vector of the virus. This virus cannot
be spread from human to human or from horse to horse. - Mod.TG]
