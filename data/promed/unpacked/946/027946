The Limpopo River, which delineates the border between Zimbabwe and
South Africa before flowing through Mozambique into the Indian Ocean,
has tested positive for cholera, according to local media reports.

According to the UN, Zimbabwe's "unprecedented cholera outbreak" has
claimed 565 lives from the 12 546 recorded cases since August 2008,
and "is worsening and is becoming difficult to contain as it spreads
from cities." Zimbabwe Doctors for Human Rights, a non-governmental
organization, said the death toll could be in excess of 1000 people.

The UN children's agency, UNICEF, said in a statement: "The onset of
the rainy season threatens to make the waterborne disease endemic, as
the spread of cholera becomes increasingly unpredictable and the
response is outpaced by the outbreaks. Harare (the capital), where
the highest numbers of cholera cases have been reported, continues to
experience serious water outages."

The provincial health department spokesperson for South Africa's
Limpopo Province, which borders Zimbabwe, told a local radio station
that all the cholera cases detected in South Africa were linked to
the Zimbabwe outbreak. There have been 6 known deaths from cholera in
South Africa, 2 South Africans and 4 Zimbabweans.

UNICEF said it had provided the Harare authorities with a month's
supply of water treatment chemicals for the city and was distributing
about 360 000 litres of drinking water daily. Fuel, also in short
supply, was being provided to assist in the cholera emergency; 40 000
liters of intravenous fluids had been distributed, as well as
thousands of hygiene kits, water treatment tablets and body bags.
Reticulated water was reportedly restored to Harare on 3 Dec 2008
after all water supplies had been cut off for the past few days.

The cholera epidemic is now affecting 42 of Zimbabwe's 62 districts.

[The number of cases of cholera in Zimbabwe continues to rise
dramatically, underscoring the need for rapid intervention. In one
day, there were 811 more cases reported, with 81 more deaths.

[2] Cholera - Zimbabwe: Further spread in and outside Zimbabwe

As of 1 Dec 2008, the Ministry of Health in Zimbabwe has reported a
total of 11 735 cholera cases with 484 deaths since August 2008,
affecting all provinces in the country. The overall case fatality
rate is 4 percent but has reached up to 20-30 percent in remote
areas. Out of the total number of cases, 50 percent have been
reported from Budiriro, a high density suburb of the capital city,
Harare. Beitbridge, a town bordering South Africa, has reported 26
percent of all cases. In the last 2 days, 2 additional areas have
been affected: Chegutu (in Mashonaland West province) and Mvuma (in
Midlands province). Reports have also been received from the
Ministries of Health in neighboring countries confirming that cholera
cases have occurred in Musina (South Africa), Palm Tree (Botswana)
and Guro district (Mozambique).

Cholera outbreaks have become more frequent in Zimbabwe since the
early 1990s. However, with the exception of the large outbreaks that
occurred in 1999 and 2002, the disease has been kept under control
through intensified prevention and preparedness activities.

Communities are being encouraged to protect themselves against
cholera by adhering to proper food safety practices as well as to
good personal hygiene. Early rehydration at home by using oral
rehydration salts is paramount to diminishing mortality.

Mass chemoprophylaxis with antibiotics is strongly discouraged, as it
has no effect on the spread of cholera, can have adverse effects by
increasing antimicrobial resistance and provides a false sense of
security.

Once an outbreak has started, WHO does not recommend the use of the
current internationally available WHO prequalified oral cholera
vaccine. This is due to its 2-dose regimen, the time required to
reach protective efficacy and the high cost and heavy logistics
associated with its use. The use of the parenteral cholera vaccine
has never been recommended by WHO due to its low protective efficacy
and the occurrence of severe adverse events.

In controlling the spread of cholera, WHO does not recommend any
special restrictions to travel or trade to or from affected areas.
However, neighboring countries are encouraged to strengthen their
active surveillance and preparedness systems.

An Ethiopian who arrived in East London from Zimbabwe on Sunday [30
Nov 2008] is being treated for cholera, the Eastern Cape Health
Department said on Wednesday [3 Dec 2008].

Department spokesperson Sizwe Kupelo said: "He arrived on Sunday and
got sick on Monday [1 Dec 2008]. A team has since been sent out to
test the 2 people he stayed with on his arrival," he said.

International Federation Red Cross (IFRC) has confirmed that the
cholera outbreak which began in Zimbabwe has already affected over 12
500 people, and at least 500 people have died. The outbreak has also
been posing serious health risks across the border in South Africa's
Limpopo province, where approximately 6 deaths and 400 cases have
been reported so far.

[Limpopo
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limpopo>
was previously known as the Northern province.

A map of South Africa showing the mentioned areas can be found at
<http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/southafr.pdf>.
As can be seen on the map, Eastern Cape province does not border
Zimbabwe and represents the furthermost southerly spread of cholera
in South Africa.
