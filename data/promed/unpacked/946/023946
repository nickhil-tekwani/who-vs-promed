Typhoid fever case was registered in Komi, Russia
-------------------------------------------------
A case of typhoid fever was registered in the Siktikvar district of
the Komi region in Russia. For Komi, it is an extremely rare
disease. No cases were recorded for years, and only 2 cases were
registered during 2003.
According to Tatyana Petunina, a chief physician of Epidemiologist
and Surveillance Center, a young woman from Siktikvar has been
diagnosed with typhoid fever.
The source of infection is not yet known; epidemiologists are
currently investigating. According to preliminary data, a woman had
contacts with relatives from Dagestan. Besides that, she works as a
cleaner. At present, all people who had contacts with her are being
checked, and the woman herself is undergoing treatment in the
hospital.
Typhoid fever is transmitted through contaminated water and direct
contact with people. As a rule, typhoid fever is more common in the
southern part of Russia.
To prevent spread of infection, the following measures are being
taken: market sanitary hygienic control, and checking places where
people from the southern regions of Russia reside.
