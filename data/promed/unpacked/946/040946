The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention is reviewing the province's 1st confirmed H7N9 case.

The patient, male, 50 years old, was engaged in live poultry trade and slaughter activities. On 22 Apr 2015, the patient was diagnosed as a suspected H7N9 case at the Hubei Provincial People's Hospital, after which he was admitted to Wuhan medical treatment centers and held in isolation. At present, the patient's condition is stable... - more

The incident has prompted emergency measures required to close the live animal markets; all of the chickens were culled and processed, which was carried out by health care practitioners; they also are carrying out comprehensive medical [testing] at health institutions for a fever of unknown origin...

It should be noted that a year ago, a resident of Wuhan, Hubei Province fell ill while in Guangdong Province and subsequently died. That case ended up being attributed to Guangdong's totals.

[This case is no. 658 since H7N9 activity was 1st detected in China in 2013, according to FluTrackers (https://flutrackers.com/forum/forum/china-h7n9-outbreak-tracking/143874-flutrackers-2013-15-human-case-list-of-provincial-ministry-of-health-government-confirmed-influenza-a-h7n9-cases-with-links) and the 1st detected in Hubei province this year, 2015. The previous reported case, a 3-year-old male, was hospitalized in Anhui province on 7 Apr 2015. The number of cases of H7N9 in Mainland China appears to be on the decline since 20 cases were reported by the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) of China on 10 Apr 2015 (see ProMED-mail post Avian influenza, human (93): WHO update H5N1 and H7N9, China H7N9 20150416.3301012).
