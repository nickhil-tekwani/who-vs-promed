The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services says it is investigating a cluster of gastrointestinal illnesses caused by _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium. Health officials said the root of the problem may lie in alfalfa sprouts.

To date [Fri 23 Dec 2022], 12 people affected have reported eating alfalfa sprouts between [4 and 15 Dec 2022], both at restaurants or at home after purchasing from grocery stores. The department of health is recommending people avoid eating alfalfa sprouts amid the ongoing investigation. Officials urge those sick with diarrhea after consuming alfalfa sprouts to contact their local health department, and their doctor if medical attention is needed.

Most people recover from salmonella infection in 4 to 7 days without antimicrobials, but those with weakened immune systems, over the age of 65 or under the age of one have an increased risk of severe infection.

[A number of significant pathogens, including salmonella, listeria, and enterohemorrhagic _Escherichia coli_, have been linked to transmission from ingestion of a variety of different kinds of sprouts in the USA and elsewhere.

The following is a review of outbreaks caused by sprouts:

Abstract
--------
"After a series of outbreaks associated with sprouts in the mid-1990s, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published guidelines in 1999 for sprouts producers to reduce the risk of contamination. The recommendations included treating seeds with an antimicrobial agent such as calcium hypochlorite solution and testing spent irrigation water for pathogens. From 1998 through 2010, 33 outbreaks from seed and bean sprouts were documented in the USA, affecting 1330 reported persons. A total of 28 outbreaks were caused by salmonella, 4 by Shiga toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_, and one by listeria. In 15 of the 18 outbreaks with information available, growers had not followed key FDA guidelines. In 3 outbreaks, however, the implicated sprouts were produced by firms that appeared to have implemented key FDA guidelines. Although seed chlorination, if consistently applied, reduces the pathogen burden on sprouts, it does not eliminate the risk of human infection. Further seed and sprout disinfection technologies, some recently developed, will be needed to enhance sprout safety and reduce human disease. Improved seed production practices could also decrease pathogen burden, but, because seeds are a globally distributed commodity, will require international cooperation."
