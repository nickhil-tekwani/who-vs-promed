Equine influenza - Australia (NSW, QLD)
SUMMARY SITUATION REPORT
This information is an update on information provided on 3 Sep 2007,
which should be referred to for background information.
1. Key Points
Equine Influenza (EI) was first detected at Eastern Creek Quarantine
Station (ECQS), Sydney, New South Wales (NSW), Australia, on 17 Aug
2007. Sick horses were seen on 22 Aug 2007 at Centennial Parklands
Equestrian Centre (CPEC) in Sydney.
There are currently 214 infected premises (IPs) in Australia; 40 of
these are in Queensland and the remainder in NSW. There are currently
more than 410 dangerous contact properties (DCPs) being assessed and
more than 360 are in NSW. The number of new IPs is still climbing.
State-wide horse movement bans remain in place in Queensland, New
South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory. Other
jurisdictions have partially lifted their movement bans.
Non-essential gatherings of horses continue to be discouraged in all
states and territories.
2. Current Situation
The Australian Animal Health Laboratory has identified the virus as
H3 Equine Influenza.
New South Wales
Restricted areas (RAs) have been amalgamated. There are 18 RAs:
Baradine, Broughton (near Gerringong), Caroona (north-west of
Quirindi), Centennial Park and Redfern, Coonamble, Cooyal (north-east
of Mudgee), Gulargambone, Hornsby, Hunter Valley and Tamworth, Lake
Macquarie, Mount Hunter (near Camden), Moree, Narrabri, Parkes,
Sydney Metropolitan and its Environs, Terry Hie Hie (south-east of
Moree), Wauchope (Oxley Highway) and Wollondilly.
Assessment of some IP clusters suggest aerial transmission up to 1.5
km [.93 miles] under favourable conditions may be occurring.
Queensland
There are 40 IPs in Queensland and 57 DCPs. The IPs are near Warwick,
Minden, Rosewood, Brisbane west, Tamborine and Goondiwindi. There is
concern that windborne spread may be an issue in Queensland and this
is being investigated with meteorological experts. Potential spread
of the virus in run-off after heavy rains is being addressed.
Other jurisdictions
Surveillance activities in all states continue unchanged. Suspect
cases of EI must be reported to state authorities. It is an offence
not to report.
3. Response
State and local disease control centres have been established in NSW
and Qld with forward command posts in relevant locations. These
centres are coordinating and managing the response in each state.
4. Further information

time and may not reflect the current situation, given the rate at
which events are unfolding.

[The increase in the number of cases is somewhat to be expected at
this point in the control/eradication attempts. Although this update
mentions wind movement, it is more often associated with close
contact. There are continued media reports of violation of the
stand-still order -- this seems a more likely method of spread.
However, mutation of the virus may allow for airborne spread. - Mod.TG]
