Age information was available for 860 people. Their ages range from less than 1 to 97 years, with a median age of 36 years, and 220 (26%) are young children under 5 years. Of 842 people with sex information available, 493 (59%) are female. Of 617 people with information available, 203 (33%) have been hospitalized. 2 deaths have been reported, 1 from Indiana and 1 from Virginia.

The true number of sick people in an outbreak is likely much higher than the number reported, and the outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses. This is because many people recover without medical care and are not tested for _Salmonella_. In addition, recent illnesses may not yet be reported as it usually takes 3 to 4 weeks to determine if a sick person is part of an outbreak.

State and local public health officials are interviewing people about the animals they came into contact with the week before they got sick. Of the 527 people interviewed, 365 (69%) reported contact with backyard poultry before getting sick.

Laboratory Data
---------------
WGS [whole genome sequencing] was also used to identify any predicted antimicrobial resistance for bacteria from 845 sick people's samples, 4 animal samples, and 7 environmental samples. Of the 856 samples, 304 (36%) were predicted to be resistant to one or more of the following antibacterials: amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (0.7%), ampicillin (1.1%), chloramphenicol (0.4%), cefoxitin (0.7%), ceftriaxone (0.7%), ciprofloxacin (0.1%), gentamicin (2.1%), kanamycin (0.4%), streptomycin (33.6%), sulfamethoxazole (2.7%), tetracycline (32.1%), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (0.2%). Testing of 5 clinical isolates using standard antibiotic susceptibility testing methods by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) confirmed these results (streptomycin and kanamycin were not tested by this method).

Most people with _Salmonella_ illness recover without antimicrobials. However, if antibacterials are needed, some illnesses in these outbreaks may be difficult to treat with some commonly recommended antimicrobials and may require a different therapeutic choice.

[Having a flock of backyard fowl can serve a number of purposes, including home-raised meat, fresh eggs, and companionship, but care must be taken to avoid the zoonosis salmonellosis.

The following recommendations are from the CDC: What Backyard Flock Owners Should Do (https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/backyardpoultry-05-21/index.html):

"Wash your hands
- Always wash your hands with soap and water immediately after touching backyard poultry, their eggs, or anything in the area where they live and roam.
- Use hand sanitizer if soap and water are not readily available. Consider having hand sanitizer at your coop.

"Be safe around backyard flocks
- Don't kiss or snuggle backyard poultry, and don't eat or drink around them. This can spread _Salmonella_ germs to your mouth and make you sick.
- Keep your backyard flock and supplies you use to care for them (like feed containers and shoes you wear in the coop) outside of the house. You should also clean the supplies outside the house.

"Supervise kids around flocks
- Always supervise children around backyard poultry and make sure they wash their hands properly afterward.
- Don't let children younger than 5 years touch chicks, ducklings, or other backyard poultry. Young children are more likely to get sick from germs like _Salmonella_.

"Handle eggs safely
- Collect eggs often. Eggs that sit in the nest can become dirty or break.
- Throw away cracked eggs. Germs on the shell can more easily enter the egg through a cracked shell.
- Rub off dirt on eggs with fine sandpaper, a brush, or a cloth. Don't wash them because colder water can pull germs into the egg.
- Refrigerate eggs to keep them fresh and slow the growth of germs.
- Cook eggs until both the yolk and white are firm, and cook egg dishes to an internal temperature of 160 deg F (71 deg C) to kill all germs." - Mod.LL
