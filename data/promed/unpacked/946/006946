Anthrax cases in Karimpore, West Bengal, India
-----------------------------------------------
(Based on a report published in Anandabazar Patrika, 18 May 2005, by Susmit
Halder).
In the Sahebpara village of Karimpore in West Bengal, 27 persons are now
suffering from cutaneous anthrax, including 10 children, following handling
of meat from a dead cow which had died due to anthrax. The health officials
are closely watching all the cases so that no further spread occurs. A
massive anthrax awareness program has been initiated in the area to prevent
any such outbreak in the future.

[The problem with West Bengal is that their veterinary program consists of
merely responding to outbreaks and human cases. What is needed, and would
be more cost-effective, is a proactive livestock annual vaccination program
that also monitors actual vaccination usage, provides ongoing public
education, improved reporting, and has a Veterinary Assistant village
presence in relation to unexpected deaths of livestock. The statement that
"a massive anthrax awareness program has been initiated" is a much
trumpeted stable-door action by the authorities. If you read back through
the reports of the past few years below, there is a consistent history of
reaction, not pro-activity, that each year results in human cases in
significant numbers and deaths, quite apart from the regular livestock
anthrax deaths feeding the situation. It is an ongoing tragedy. - Mod.MHJ]
