Fungus attacks on gourd family crops hit Sindh farmers hard. Increasing salinity, extreme heat, and mysterious diseases together have made farmers reluctant to cultivate this crop. Many farmers say that mysterious "virus" [see comment below] destroys plant and product. Farmers in a coastal region of Thatta district [Sindh] have also witnessed the same problem of "virus" attacks on melon crop. Some have tried to use pesticides, but in vain.

Prof Ismail Kumbhar, Sindh Agriculture University (SAU), calls the "virus" fusarium wilt, which attacks all cucurbit family crops and causes destruction. He suggests adoption of natural pest management for the crops. Melon wilt incurs heavy economic loss. Some control methods have been developed, success is limited. There is a need of efforts strengthening coordination within departments, researchers, and agriculture-related institutes to work together and find a solution.

Prof Kumbhar claims to have received information about fusarium wilt from Mirpurkhas district [Sindh] where the disease has been detected in apple gourd, cucumber, and melons. Farmers in different parts of Sindh have realised a change, including rising temperature and mysterious crop diseases, which have impacted badly on their livelihoods.

[The word "virus" above appears to be used as a general term to indicate disease, not to specify an actual pathogen.

Fusarium wilt on cucurbits is caused by different strains of the fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_ (Fo). Each pathogen is highly specialised attacking only a single crop species, for example f. sp. _cucumerinum_ affects cucumber (_Cucumis sativus_), f. sp. _melonis_ affects rockmelon and muskmelon (both _Cucumis melo_) and f.sp. _niveum_ affects watermelon (_Citrullus lanatus_). Therefore, since the item above reports fusarium wilt on a range of cucurbit crops, several strains of the fungus must be present in the area.

Cucurbit fusarium wilts can cause serious crop losses. Symptoms include discolouration of vascular bundles and wilting of the plant. Plants may be affected at any growth stage: young seedlings are killed or severely stunted, while older plants wilt at midday for a few days, then permanently wilt and die. Disease development is favoured by high soil temperatures.

The fungi can persist in the soil for many years. Spread occurs mainly on contaminated seed, with soil, infected crop debris, irrigation water, and human activities (for example on contaminated farm machinery). Disease management requires an integrated approach including crop rotation and phytosanitary measures to avoid spread to new fields. The usefulness of resistant crop cultivars, if available, may also depend on fungal populations in the soil. Flooding of fields has been reported to reduce pathogen survival in the soil.

Different strains of the fungus cause wilting diseases with serious losses in other crops, such as banana (Panama disease), lettuce, guava, vanilla, sweet potato, tomato, and date palm. (For more information see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives.)
