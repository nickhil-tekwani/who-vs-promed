[An English summary of a paper in German, published 31 May 2015:
Rohkohl J, Schulze C, Bilk S. Hemorrhagic septicemia on a dairy farm in Lower Saxony. Der Praktische Tierarzt 96, 598-608]

Summary
Hemorrhagic septicemia, an peracute/acute disease caused by _Pasteurella multocida_ capsular type B, led to considerable losses (19 milking cows and juvenile cattle) on a dairy farm in Lower Saxony. The affected farm used 2 milking robots, which accumulated various milking data. Collected data were analyzed retrospectively. The results showed a longer existing disease with milk losses as a consequence of fever approximately more than 1-2 weeks before affected cows finally died in this naturally infected herd.

A 2nd disease outbreak in the same dairy herd 2 weeks after the last treatment seem to indicate that there is no protective herd immunity after natural infection. Outbreaks of hemorrhagic septicemia on other farms in Northern Germany in the years 2013 and 2014 should lead to increased awareness among veterinarians and cattle owners about this disease.

[According to Germany's annual report to the OIE (2014), haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS) in domestic bovines has been absent since its last occurrence in 1986.

Haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS) is a major disease of cattle and buffaloes characterised by an acute, highly fatal septicaemia with high morbidity and mortality. It results from infection by _Pasteurella multocida subsp. multocida_, a Gram negative coccobacillus in the family Pasteurellaceae. _P. multocida multocida_ can cause a variety of diseases in animals, but only 2 serotypes of this organism classically cause hemorrhagic septicemia. Because 2 systems, the Namioka-Carter and Carter-Heddleston systems, are used to designate _P. multocida_ serotypes, each serotype has 2 names. One is known as B:2 in the Carter-Heddleston system and 6:B in the Namioka-Carter system. The other is E:2 in the Carter-Heddleston system and 6:E in the Namioka-Carter system. In both systems, the letter stands for the capsular antigen and the number designates the somatic antigen. In India, the serotypes A:1 and A:3 (Carter-Heddleston system) have also been linked to HS.

Septicemic pasteurellosis, a disease that is clinically indistinguishable from hemorrhagic septicemia, has been reported sporadically from wild ruminants, especially cervids. This disease may also be called hemorrhagic septicemia in the literature. A variety of serotypes including B:3,4, A:3,4 and B:1 have been linked to septicemic pasteurellosis. (for the above and additional information on HS, please refer to the review, updated 2009, at http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/hemorrhagic_septicemia.pdf).

According to chapter 2.4.12 of OIE's Terrestrial Manual (Version adopted by the World Assembly of Delegates of the OIE in May 2012),
HS, a notifiable bovine disease, is caused by serotypes of _Pasteurella multocida_ that are geographically restricted to some areas of Asia, Africa, the Middle East and southern Europe. The diagnosis of the disease is based on the clinical signs, gross lesions, morbidity and mortality patterns. Confirmation requires the isolation and characterisation of the pathogen using conventional and molecular techniques. There are no confirmed reports of human infections with _P. multocida_ B2 and E2; however, other serotypes do cause human infections and precautions should be taken to avoid exposure. The organism should be handled in biosafety level 2 laboratories.

If the diagnostic tests performed in the 2 described German outbreaks, including serotyping, are indicative of HS as described in the Manual, notification to the OIE deserves to be considered.

Recently, a major epizootic of HS has been notified by Kazakhstan to the OIE, reportedly causing the death of some 135 000 (!) saiga antelopes (_Saiga tatarica_); see ProMED-mail 20150606.3415543. Results of serotyping are anticipated. In view of the exceptional dimensions of the event, it would be interesting to note if the involvement of predisposing or synergic factors (for example, viral or/and physical/chemical ones) have been excluded. - Mod.AS
