Bird flu confirmed in S.Korea
------------------------------
South Korean confirmed the suspect case of a mild strain of bird influenza
virus at a duck farm on Thursday, according to South Korean national news
agency Yonhap News.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry was quoted by Yonhap as saying a
series of DNA tests found that ducks at the farm in Gwangju, about 330
kilometers southwest of Seoul, were infected with the low-pathogenicity
avian influenza virus H5N2.
It is the 1st time that the H5N2 virus has been discovered in the country.
Between December 2003 and March 2004, a highly pathogenic H5N1 virus hit
South Korean chicken and duck farms, costing the poultry industry as much
as 1 trillion won (USD 951 million).
Preliminary tests on eggs from the farm had shown that the ducks had the
less virulent strain of the influenza that does not spread to humans or
mutate into the highly pathogenic subtype.
All 9000 ducks on the farm were slaughtered and buried Wednesday [22 Dec
2004], while a wide quarantine area has been designated around the farm to
prevent possible spread, the ministry said.
The highly pathogenic variant is characterized by sudden onset, severe
illness and rapid death, with mortality that can approach 100 percent.
Following news of the bird influenza discovery, Japan imposed an import ban
on chicken from South Korea late Wednesday.

[Until recently, only highly pathogenic avian influenza had to be reported
to the OIE. However, in view of the zoonotic aspects of avian influenza,
the need for the inclusion of certain strains, even if they demonstrate
lower pathogenicity in fowl, has become apparent. The traditional OIE
definition of the disease is currently undergoing a revision, the disease
becoming known as "notifiable avian influenza." The new definition,
included in article 2.7.12.5 (Under study) of OIE's Terrestrial Animal
Health Code, is as follows:
"For the purposes of this Terrestrial Code, notifiable avian influenza
(NAI) is defined as an infection of poultry caused by any influenza A virus
of the H5 or H7 subtypes or by any AI virus with an intravenous
pathogenicity index (IVPI) greater than 1.2 (or as an alternative at least
75 percent mortality) as described below. NAI viruses can be divided into
highly pathogenic notifiable avian influenza (HPNAI) and low pathogenicity
notifiable avian influenza (LPNAI).
HPNAI viruses have an IVPI in 6-week-old chickens greater than 1.2 or, as
an alternative, cause at least 75 percent mortality in 4-to 8-week-old
chickens infected intravenously. H5 and H7 viruses which do not have an
IVPI of greater than 1.2 or cause less than 75 percent mortality in an
intravenous lethality test should be sequenced to determine whether
multiple basic amino acids are present at the cleavage site of the
haemagglutinin molecule (HA0); if the amino acid motif is similar to that
observed for other HPNAI isolates, the isolate being tested should be
considered as HPNAI".
From the above news item it appears that the current S. Korean virus is an
LPNAI. It has to be officially reported to the OIE if the provisions of the
Code "under study" chapter are adhered to. - Mod.AS]
