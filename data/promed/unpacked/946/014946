The Oruro department [state or province equivalent] entered
epidemiological week 49 [4-10 Dec 2011] with nearly 20 canine rabies
cases among 46 samples [tested], which generated an alert issued by
local authorities.

With the aim of blocking the focus of the virus, the Zoonoses [unit]
of the departmental Health Services (SEDES) this Sunday [18 Dec 2011]
will vaccinate all companion animals [just dogs and cats?], especially
in the southern area of the capital city [Oruro]. The head of
Zoonoses, Ernesto Vasquez, said that they had 3500 doses of the
vaccine. "We hope that the people will come to the vaccination posts
and collaborate with the [vaccination] brigades," he said.

He warned that in the southern area [of the capital] there are a large
number of street dogs [ownerless], given this fact, he stated that
Zoonosis has recommended to the municipality a massive capture of
these [ownerless] dogs that not only bite [people], but transmit
rabies to household dogs as well.

[Canine rabies has been a problem in several places in Bolivia this
year (2011). An 11 Sep 2011 report indicated that the last vaccination
was carried out in Oruro this past August (2011) and immunized 53 854
canines of the nearly 83 498 dogs that exist within the Oruro
jurisdiction, a number estimated by the Zoonoses Unit of SEDES (see
ProMED-mail archive no. 20110912.2779). The currently proposed massive
culling will be less effective than massive vaccination of all dogs,
both owned and ownerless. Culling creates vacant territories into
which other ownerless dogs will move with aggressive interactions that
may facilitate rabies transmission, rather than halt it, as was the
case on Bali, Indonesia.
