The chief of veterinary service of Abkhazia Eric Anshba has informed
that foci of African swine fever [ASF] have been identified in
Galsky, Ochamchirsky, Tuarchalsky and Gulrypshsky districts of
Abkhazia. On the other hand, the situation is better in the Sukhumy
district while the districts Gudautsky and Gagrsky are not infected.
Veterinarians in Abkhazia are of the opinion that culling of the
entire pig population in the eastern districts (bordering Georgia) is
necessary to prevent its spread throughout the rest of the country.

[According to the above information, ASF is present in the 4 eastern
districts of the territory; see map of Abkhazia at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Abkhazia_detail_map.png>. For the
districts, see map 2 in the paper at
<http://www.circassianworld.com/NWCaucasus_GB.html>.
On 20 Aug 2007, Georgia sent an immediate notification to the OIE
about 2 outbreaks of ASF in Abkhazia Autonomous Republic (see post
number 20070820.2724). The outbreaks were located in the Gulripish
(Gulrypshsky) district (see the map in the notification at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=5932>).
This information is in agreement with the data provided now from
Abkhazia; no outbreaks in the more eastern districts have been
reported by Georgia. - Mod.AS]
