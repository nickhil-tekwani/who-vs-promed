The detection of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] in Chikwawa and Nsanje
has forced government to ban the movement of cattle and its related
products from the Lower Shire to other parts of the country, creating
uncertainty on the continued availability of meat in some Southern
Region urban centres, which rely on supplies from the 2 districts.

The ban has mainly affected the meat business in the City of
Blantyre, which is the main market for the Lower Shire meat.
Government issued the ban last week [week of 1 Oct 2008] following
reports that some parts of the sub-region were hit by the disease.

According to Chikwawa District animal health and livestock
development officer Laston Zammimba, the disease was first reported
in Sorjini, Nsanje, last month [September 2008].

"It started in Nsanje and a ban was issued restricting movement of
livestock from the district to other areas. But after 2 weeks, the
disease was also reported in Chikwawa.

"So, as a control measure, there is a ban (effective last Wednesday
[1 Oct 2008]) on the movement of livestock and its products from the
Lower Shire. We have also mounted roadblocks at Sorjini, Lengwe
turn-off, and Thabwa where travellers have to be disinfected as they
are coming from the Lower Shire," said Zammimba.

"As of now, we haven't started vaccinating the animals because we are
waiting for results of the specimen, which was sent for testing to
establish what type of viral infection it is so that we can purchase
the right vaccine," said Zammimba.

Animal health and livestock development director Wilfred Lipita said
the sample was sent to South Africa. "We can't dictate how soon we
will get the results, but I know they are trying their best to do it
as fast as possible," said Lipita.

S & A Cold Storage managing director Abida Sidik Mia -- who also runs
a livestock farm in Chikwawa -- said the situation is worrying. "We
don't have FMD on our farm. I am hoping they will establish a
sanitary centre to check and spray vehicles carrying cattle into
town, as was the case the last time there was an outbreak so as not
to affect our cash flow and other businesses," said Mia.

Etta Phekani of Chitawira Shopping Centre in Blantyre -- another main
meat outlet -- said the shop has run out of stock. "We haven't had
meat since yesterday (Monday [6 Oct 2008]). Our supplier in the Lower
Shire informed us last week about the disease and the ban. We have
been told that they are still investigating to see which specific
areas have been affected. "But our business has been greatly
affected... Our customers have also been affected because meat is
scarce," said Phekani.

Former sports minister Moses Dossi, in an interview at Chitawira
Shopping Centre yesterday [7 Oct 2008], described the situation as a "crisis."

"The development has affected the business people and consumers, and
mostly the farmers in the villages who rely on cattle farming to earn
a living. It is a disaster," said Dossi.

[According to the OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health)
notification (item 2; including a map), the disease started in
Nsanje, southern Malawi, on 5 Sep 2008 and was confirmed on 24 Sep
2008 while serotyping at a reference laboratory was pending.
According to the current newswire (item 1), the disease has spread in
the meantime to the neighbouring district Chikwawa, causing
economical losses, while, allegedly, vaccination is delayed since no
serotyping has yet become available. This requires confirmation or otherwise.
