Angola: Marburg hemorrhagic fever outbreak - WHO Update 19
-----------------------------------------------
As of Tue 17 May 2005, the Ministry of Health in Angola has reported 337
cases of Marburg hemorrhagic fever. Of these cases, 311 were fatal. The
vast majority of cases have occurred in Uige Province, where 326 cases and
300 deaths have been reported. No cases have been reported outside Uige for
the past 5 weeks.
Infrastructures and protocols for controlling the outbreak are in place and
functioning well. The isolation unit at Uige's provincial hospital is being
used, infection control in the hospital has improved, and safe burial
practices are now being followed. Portable field laboratories continue to
provide rapid diagnostic support. A campaign to stop home treatment of
patients using unsafe injections has resulted in the collection and safe
disposal of a large number of needles and syringes. The campaign, which has
been supported by religious and community leaders and volunteers from the
local Red Cross, is thought to have raised public awareness of the
associated risks considerably.
Support from religious and community leaders has also allowed the work of
mobile surveillance teams to run more smoothly, increasing the efficiency
of case finding and contact tracing. However, some new cases continue to be
linked to exposure in homes and at funerals, indicating that public
understanding of the disease still needs to be improved.
As transmission of the virus requires close personal contact with an ill or
recently deceased patient, the risk to international travelers
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2005_04_13/en/index.html> to Angola is
considered to be very low. WHO does not recommend any restrictions on
travel or trade to or from Angola.
