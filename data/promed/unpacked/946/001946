The deadly Nipah virus that struck Kozhikode district in Kerala last month [May 2018] and claimed 16 lives in the state has been finally contained, and the last of the 2 positive cases have fully recovered, said Kerala Health Minister KK Shailaja on Sunday [10 Jun 2018].

Including the man who was the 1st person suspected to have died of the infection, the death toll stands at 17.

The virus struck at Kozhikode, which saw 13 people dying, while 3 deaths were reported from nearby Malappuram district, and more than 2000 patients with fever were kept under close observation.

After presiding over a review meeting, the Health Minister told media persons that the virus scare is finally over.

"We visited the 2 Nipah-positive patients who have been completely cured, and, according to many, this is something rare. The scare of this getting spread is finally over, as no more patients have tested positive, but a caution has to be there for those who are under observation, as they have to take complete rest," said Shailaja.

The district authorities, following the scare, had asked to wait for schools to reopen in the new academic year, and now schools are all set to open from Tuesday [12 Jun 2018] onwards while the ban on public functions has also been lifted.

The Kozhikode Medical College hospital, where a special Nipah ward was opened, is now seeing patients returning home, said an official.

Earlier on 4 Jun [2018], the state health department had declared that apart from the 18 positive cases, no new cases were reported. Of the total 244 samples sent for testing, as many as 226 samples turned negative, the department said.

The state department had confirmed that nobody has been affected with Nipah virus since 17 May [2018].

In a press meeting, KK Shylaja said that the anxieties about the 2nd phase of Nipah virus infection have been allayed but added that vigilance will continue till 30 Jun [2018].

[It appears that this contained Nipah virus outbreak has come to an end for now. It is difficult to predict whether there will be other cases in the future.

There have been occasional Nipah virus infections in West Bengal state in the past. It is likely that the virus is endemic in giant fruit bats (genus _Pteropus_) in the area, so it would not be surprising if sporadic cases occur in the future, even after a long absence. The reservoirs of Nipah virus in Malaysia and Bangladesh, and presumably in India, are giant fruit bats ("flying foxes" in the genus _Pteropus_). One hopes that the clinics and hospitals in the area will remain alert to the possibility of new cases in the future, will be aware of the risk of nosocomial transmission, and employ barrier nursing approaches to prevent that. - Mod.TY
