Leishmaniasis (cutaneous) in Australia: suspected cases in red kangaroos
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Emergency report
Information received on 1 Jul 2003 from Dr Gardner Murray, Chief
Veterinary Officer, Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry
Australia (AFFA), Canberra:
Report date: 18 Jun 2003.
The purpose of this report is to advise of the presumptive diagnosis
of cutaneous leishmaniasis in red kangaroos (_Macropus rufus_) in the
Northern Territory and of the appropriate actions taken to
investigate this matter to reach a definitive diagnosis. If
confirmed, this would represent the first diagnosis of cutaneous
leishmaniasis in a native-born Australian animal.
An investigation into the cause of granulomatous dermatitis in a
group of 4 red kangaroos has been undertaken at the Territory
Wildlife Park in the Northern Territory. We have preliminary data
from this investigation to indicate the diagnosis of a species of
Leishmania in these animals. Red kangaroos are not native to the area
and are zoo exhibits. There have been some cases of human
leishmaniasis in recent immigrants to Australia, in soldiers
returning from combat zones where Leishmania species are endemic, and
from domestic animals imported to Australia.
Histological examinations conducted at the Australian Registry of
Wildlife Health, Taronga Zoo, Sydney, and preliminary culture results
conducted at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research,
Melbourne, are consistent with an organism of the genus Leishmania.
Samples of tissue from the affected animals were also sent to the
Institute of Parasitology, University of Zurich, Switzerland, to
confirm this diagnosis with PCR [polymerase chain reaction] tests.
However at this point, laboratory tests have been unable to identify
the species involved.
It has been determined that additional cultures are required in order
to conduct isoenzyme studies to identify the species of Leishmania
involved. Identifying the species will allow us to better understand
the ecology of the parasite and the parasite's impact on human health
and animal health in the region.
Further details of this investigation will be provided in due course,
as results become available.

[Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), also known as Aleppo evil, Baghdad
boil, Delhi boil and oriental sore, is widely distributed in the
Mediterranean region and extends through the Middle East into
Afghanistan, central Asia and North West India, with isolated foci in
Africa. Iraq is one of the countries heaviest infected. The vectors
of CL in the Old World are phlebotomine sandflies belonging to the
genus _Phlebotomus_. The phlebotomus vector is present in Australia,
thus transmission is in theory possible and the climatic conditions
are also compatible.
CL is known to be caused, in the Old World, by _L. tropica_ , _L. major_
and _L. aethiopica_, while _L. infantum_ may cause both visceral and
cutaneous leishmaniasis. The source reservoir are vertebrates, mainly
rodents and dogs. In the New World (Americas), CL is caused by _L.
braziliensis complex_ , _L. mexicana complex_ and _L. peruviana_ . The
diseases are mainly zoonoses with a few exceptions. In case the diagnosis
is confirmed, molecular typing should provide a clue to the origin of the
introduction.
Details on the diagnosis of leishmaniasis [leishmaniosis in the OIE
lexicon] are available online in chapter X.1 of the OIE's Manual of
standards diagnostic tests and vaccines (2000),
