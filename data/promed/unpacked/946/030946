Philippines: Dengue Alert in Caloocan
-------------------------------------
Dengue fever has affected a number of students in Caloocan City's largest
public high school, according to Caloocan High School acting administrator
Dario Rebuelta.
Continuous rain and uncollected garbage in the city apparently brought on
the onslaught of the deadly disease that could be contracted through the
bites of a certain type of mosquito. Rebuelta yesterday said he had
supervised fumigation to prevent the outbreak of the disease.
Thousands of students yesterday were evacuated from the 3 major buildings
of the Caloocan City High School compound, Rebuelta said. But he could not
say how many students had been hit by dengue fever. Caloocan High School is
said to have more than 25 000 students. Rebuelta, a physics teacher, said
the continuous rains in the flood-prone city left puddles of water, which
served as breeding ground for the dengue mosquito. The Inquirer tried to
reach Caloocan health officials to confirm Rebuelta's reports, but no
official was available for comment.

Dengue Fever in Mexico, Central and South America: Update as of 14 Nov 2002
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Health Canada continues to monitor dengue fever activity in Central and
South America and the Caribbean.
Report from the Secretary of Health of Mexico: Mexico is currently
experiencing increased reports of dengue fever following hurricane Kenna
from the Pacific and hurricane Isidoro from the Gulf of Mexico. The
increased rains have provided excellent breeding conditions for mosquitoes.
The government of Mexico is actively responding to the current outbreak
with mosquito control activities including spraying of mosquito breeding
sites and increased public health education. Mosquito control measures are
being implemented along the Pacific coast in the states of Sinaloa,
Nayarit, and Jalisco. In the state of Jalisco, measures are being
implemented in the city of Mazatlan, and in the municipalities of Escuinapa
and El Rosario. Along the Gulf of Mexico, measures are being implemented in
the states of Campeche and Yucatan. To date this year, Mexico has reported
8363 laboratory-confirmed cases of dengue.
Some other recent country reports of interest are the following (Source:
Pan American Health Organization).
Barbados: as of week 25 of 2002, 532 case of dengue fever were reported
with an incidence rate of 198.51 per 100 000 population.
Brazil:, as of week 30 of 2002, 711 919 cases of dengue fever were reported
with an incidence rate of 412.57 per 100 000 population.
Costa Rica: as of week 38 of 2002, 9138 cases of dengue fever were reported
with an incidence rate of 268.76 per 100 000 population.
El Salvador: as of week 37 of 2002, 17 648 cases of dengue fever were
reported with an incidence rate of 275.75 per 100 000 population.
Grenada: as of week 31 of 2002, 236 cases of dengue fever were reported
with an incidence rate of 251.06 per 100 000 population.
Honduras, as of week 34 of 2002, 27 113 cases of dengue fever were reported
with an incidence rate of 412.37 per 100 000 population.
St. Vincent & Grenadines: as of week 28 of 2002, 169 cases of dengue fever
were reported with an incidence rate of 148.25 per 100 000 population.
Trinidad & Tobago: as of week 30 of 2002, 2805 cases of dengue fever were
reported with an incidence rate of 215.77 per 100 000 population.
Venezuela: as of week 35 of 2002, 29 000 cases of dengue fever were
reported with an incidence rate of 117.73 per 100 000 population.
Recommendations: Health Canada strongly recommends that travellers seek an
individual risk assessment consultation with their personal physician or a
travel medicine clinic to determine their personal risks. Health Canada
further recommends that travellers to countries where dengue fever activity
is high take personal insect precautions to avoid being bitten during the day.

Mexico: Cities on U.S.-Mexico Border Wage Battle Against Dengue
----------------------------------------------------------------
Officials on the U.S.-Mexico border on Sun 17 Nov 2002 stepped up efforts
to contain a dengue outbreak in the Mexican city of Matamoros after health
authorities confirmed 24 cases and suspected another 222. Matamoros Public
Health Director Ernesto Chanes said 6 of the suspected cases of dengue in
the 450 000-strong city were the potentially lethal dengue hemorrhagic
fever, although he said that, to date, no deaths had been reported.
Matamoros city workers are spraying neighborhoods where dengue cases have
been confirmed and soldiers are patrolling streets looking for stagnant
pools of water to contain the outbreak and stop it spreading to the U.S.
city of Brownsville, Texas, across the Rio Grande from Matamoros, Chanes
said. Brownsville health director Josue Ramirez said the city was testing
mosquitoes on a daily basis to monitor the disease and also spraying to
kill off mosquitoes and larvae. To date no case has been confirmed, Ramirez
said.
The Matamoros outbreak is one of the most concentrated in Mexico this year.
The World Health Organization (WHO) reported 3766 cases of classic and
hemorrhagic dengue fever in the first 8 months of 2002 in Mexico as a
whole. Dengue epidemics in Honduras and El Salvador, 2 Central American
nations to the south of Mexico, forced their governments to declare
national emergencies in Jul 2002 that freed up funding to fight the spread
of the disease. In Honduras, 16 people died [among] the 27 113 confirmed
cases of dengue up to the end of Aug 2002, according to WHO statistics. In
El Salvador, 10 deaths were reported [among] the 17 648 confirmed cases in
the same time frame.
