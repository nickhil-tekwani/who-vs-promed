Health authorities have confirmed a 3rd Ebola case in the city of Mbandaka in northwest Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Thursday [5 May 2022]. The 48-year-old man is a high-risk contact of the 1st patient, who died on 21 Apr 2022, said the WHO on Twitter [https://twitter.com/WHOAFRO/status/1522120922211172354].

The current outbreak is DRC's 14th in the history of the hemorrhagic fever. Health workers started Ebola vaccinations last week in Mbandaka, the capital of DRC's Equateur province. Responders have identified 444 contacts of the confirmed cases and are monitoring their health, the WHO said.

DRC is experiencing its 14th Ebola outbreak since 1976. The current outbreak is the 6th since 2018 alone, the most frequent occurrence in the country's Ebola history.

"Previous outbreaks in Equateur province were in 2020 and 2018, with 130 and 54 recorded cases, respectively, according to the WHO. In December 2021, DRC has declared the end of its 13th Ebola outbreak in which 8 cases were confirmed and 3 probable, including 6 deaths in North Kivu province."

The first 2 patients died from their infections. They include the index case -- a 31-year-old man -- and a 25-year-old woman who was his sister-in-law." - Mod.LK
