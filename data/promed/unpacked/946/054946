[Clearly, there are a number of indicators, both in this report and in our
ProMED-mail archives cited below, that Central America is experiencing a
bit of a rough time with vectorborne diseases this summer [2010]. This
report indicates that there is a concurrent outbreak of West Nile virus in
horses in the same location in Belize, and previous reports indicate that
both humans and horses have died from VEE just near the Darien Gap in
Panama. Furthermore, last year (2009), cases of eastern equine encephalitis
were reported in Belize. See Mod.TY's comments in posting "Venezuelan
equine encephalitis - Panama (03): (DR) fatal 20100620.2070" for a good
summary of the various host species, both 2- and 4-footed, currently involved.

Obviously, there are many countries between Panama at the southern most
part of Central America and Belize in the north, including Costa Rica,
Guatemala, and Honduras. None of these countries has reported VEE or other
vectorborne diseases yet. However, VEE has a natural history of moving in a
pandemic fashion up through Central America over a period of one or 2 years.

VEE was 1st isolated in 1938 from the brain of a horse in Yaracuy,
Venezuela. VEE was known to circulate in Colombia and Venezuela for the
next 30 years and is thought of as having epidemic and endemic strains. The
epidemic strains produce outbreaks in humans and equines, while the endemic
strains produce outbreaks only in humans.

One outbreak in Venezuela between 1962 and 1964, caused 23 000 human cases
with 960 people having neurological involvement and 156 deaths. In 1969,
the largest recorded VEE epidemic began in Guatemala spreading in 2 years
over a 4000 square km area to eventually reach south Texas, where its
spread was halted by vaccination and spraying for mosquitoes as well other
potential factors like better pre-existing natural immunity from exposure
to alphaviruses in the Texas horse population. This epidemic resulted in
several thousand human cases and over 100 000 equine deaths.

Clearly, the spread of the epidemic was extensive and persistent and its
results devastating for humans and horses and represents a classic case of
an emerging zoonotic disease. Control measures were implemented, and no
major outbreaks were seen until the 1990s, when a major outbreak occurred
in the southern Mexican states of Chipas in 1993 and Oaxaca in 1996.
Increasing reports of VEE activity in Columbia and Venezuela were also
noted in the early and mid 1990s. So, with an historical perspective of
this nature, the current activity in Central America bears close watching,
and any information on the strains of VEE as well as a good GIS-based
description of the outbreak by disease, strain and species involved may
shed light on the epidemiology of the current situation.
