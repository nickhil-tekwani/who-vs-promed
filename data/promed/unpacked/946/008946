I, a veterinarian with field experience, am concerned by the general tone of the approach. It seems very much to be taking on board the flavour of the month, or what is currently au fait in science. And in the process, it is, to my mind, missing a very basic point that has been true for millennia and is true irrespective of what we are doing with the majority of the environment.

To get a pandemic going:

1. It usually must start in a densely populated urban area, with a medical and infra structure system that is not fit to control infectious diseases. This hints at some degree of poverty.

2. The pathogen must enter the city in sufficient quantities to get an epidemic started, a marketing issue. Two centuries ago, milk loaded with TB did that quite well. In this century, various wildlife markets have done it.

3. Most of mankind live in cities. The expert group should focus mainly on how to defend urban populations and address methods with capacity to stop the putative pathogen getting there in quantities significant to start an epidemic.

4. I have lived most of my life in rural areas, and yes, epidemics can spread through the countryside. However, due to lower population densities, combined with the traditional tendency to discretion in such matters and ability to apply self-imposed isolation, epidemic prevention in rural areas, particularly if good movement controls are undertaken, become less challenging.

[Veterinarians are trained to attend epidemics in animals (coined "epizootics") as a major subject in their curriculum, training, and practice. The very term "herd immunity" is a reflection thereof.

The following segment from a Lancet article dated 19 Sep 2020 (Jones D, Helmreich S. A history of herd immunity. The Lancet, Perspectives. 2020; 396(10254): P810-811; DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31924-3) addresses the history of the term:

"How did herd immunity enter the language of public health? The phrase seems to have first appeared in the work of American livestock veterinarians concerned about 'contagious abortion' -- epidemics of spontaneous miscarriage -- in cattle and sheep. By the 1910s, it had become the leading contagious threat to cattle in the USA. Farmers destroyed or sold affected cows. Kansas veterinarian George Potter realised that this was the wrong approach. Writing with Adolph Eichhorn in 1916 in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association, he envisioned 'herd immunity'. As he wrote in 1918, 'Abortion disease may be likened to a fire, which, if new fuel is not constantly added, soon dies down. Herd immunity is developed, therefore, by retaining the immune cows, raising the calves, and avoiding the introduction of foreign cattle.'

"Potter's concept reached the UK in 1917 and 1920 in summaries in Veterinary Review and Scottish Agriculture. It arrived at a crucial moment. Armies and navies struggled against infections throughout World War I. Medical professionals worked to identify and treat pathogens, and also to understand their population ecology. How did pathogen virulence and population resistance drive the rise and fall of epidemic waves? In the Lancet in July 1919, bacteriologist W W C Topley described experimental epidemics he created in groups of mice. Unless there was a steady influx of susceptible mice, the rising prevalence of immune individuals would end an epidemic. In a 1923 article in the Journal of Hygiene, he and G S Wilson described this phenomenon as 'herd immunity.'

"The idea moved into medicine. In 1922, Topley suggested a parallel between outbreaks in mice and children: 'Such a likeness would seem to exist in the case of epidemic diseases affecting children of school age.' He also wondered whether measures already 'in vogue in dealing with epidemics among live-stock, where methods of segregation are so much more easily enforced than among human populations,' might inform decisions about school closings amid epidemics."
