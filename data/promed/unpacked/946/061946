An outbreak of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) in Araria district of Bihar has claimed the lives of 8 children over the past 6 weeks.

The outbreak came after the disease killed over 130 children and affected over 700 of them in Muzaffarpur and its adjacent districts in north Bihar in May and June this year [2014].

Araria Civil Surgeon Dr BK Thakur said, "All deaths due to AES have been recorded in the district between 12 Aug-24 Sep [2014]. We have no information of any other child being affected by the disease after that."

All children who died due to AES are in the age group of 1-7 years and they belonged to families who live in the rural areas of Araria, and are not financially well-off.

The Civil Surgeon said intensive vaccination drive was being conducted in the affected areas of the districts and the disease seemed to be under control now.

AES has become an annual phenomenon during the pre-monsoon summer season in north Bihar districts. Scientists and researchers have so far been unable to identify the cause of the disease.

In absence of the identification of virus, bacteria, or any other agent that causes this deadly disease which has a death rate of 26 percent, doctors at their best could only provide symptomatic treatment to the patients.

[No data are presented in the report above on the proportion of the encephalitis cases in the area due to Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infections or from other causes. The most recent cases fall within the usual season of the year for JEV transmission.

It seems odd that the report states that "scientists and researchers have been unable to identify the cause of AES". Previous reports from this area associated some encephalitis cases with contaminated water. However, in revisiting the comments made by Dr T Jacob John, he mentioned that cases in this area early in the year may be due to a Reye-like syndrome. In a 24 Jun 2014 comment (ProMED-mail archive no 20140625.2563561) concerning the Reye-like syndrome, he stated that "the disease is undoubtedly hypoglycemic encephalopathy (with blood glucose levels below 40 in about half the children in whom testing was done), and lower than 80 in 80-85 percent. The lesson was to give 10 percent dextrose infusion as soon as possible after drawing blood for glucose measurement. Pediatricians who did this tell me that children given 10 percent dextrose within a short period of onset tend to recover within a few hours and are well to go home the next day." In another comment on 3 Aug 2014 (see ProMED-mail archive no 20140804.2656983), he noted, "I understand that West Nile virus is also present in that region, and some AES [acute encephalitis syndrome] may indeed be West Nile encephalitis." He indicated that JEV cases occur later in the year during the typical JEV transmission season.

The report above provides no information about the JEV vaccination status of the population in the affected areas, or the number of cases laboratory confirmed as JEV infections.
