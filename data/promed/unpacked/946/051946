Anthrax Case Confirmed in Sheep in Irion County [edited]
--------------------------------------------
A yearling female sheep in West Texas has been diagnosed with anthrax. This is the 2nd confirmed case of anthrax in a Texas animal for 2012 and the 1st in livestock this year. The infected sheep was located near Mertzon, Texas (Irion County,) which is approximately 26 miles southwest of San Angelo. The Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) has quarantined the premises. TAHC regulations require vaccinations of exposed livestock and proper disposal of carcasses before a quarantine can be released.

"The TAHC will continue to closely monitor the situation for possible new cases across the state. Producers are encouraged to consult with their veterinary practitioner or local TAHC office about the disease and about preventative measures such as vaccination of livestock," Dr. Dee Ellis, State Veterinarian, said.

[Anthrax outbreaks in this area north of the Edwards Plateau are infrequently reported and because stock are not vaccinated it can be worrying when it occurs. A report of a single sheep affected means that the report is based on one sample from one animal found dead. As no other information is on the submitting document to the diagnostic laboratory it is assumed to be a singular case. In my experience anthrax deaths in sheep are never singular if only because a number, sometimes in double digits, have to have died before the owner or shepherd pays it any attention.

If you find Abilene on the relief, San Angelo is SW of it, and Mertzon is WSW of San Angelo. In Aussi terms it is a way beyond the black stump.
