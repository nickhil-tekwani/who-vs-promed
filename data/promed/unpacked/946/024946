The Rensselaer County Health Department closed a spring Friday [18 Sep
2009] after 6 people became sick with "beaver fever." Residents are
advised not to drink water from a spring located 1/4 mile north of the
intersection of routes 22 and 43. "The warning has been issued due to
a cluster of individuals who have become ill after consuming water
obtained from the site, the county Health Department press release
states.

The state Department of Transportation, which owns the site, fenced
off the spring, and a county health sign was posted advising of the
potential health problems from drinking water from the spring.

The individuals who drank the water became ill with an intestinal
disorder known as giardiasis. It is commonly called beaver fever. The
intestinal illness is caused by a microscopic parasite called _Giardia
lamblia_, according to the state Health Department.

Those who drank the spring water and experience symptoms of nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain or a combination of these symptoms
are advised to contact their health care provider. More information is
available at the county Health Department website at

[Giardia species are found in many mammals and are common in surface
water and may contaminate drinking water. For the period 1995-1996, 13
states reported a total of 22 outbreaks associated with drinking
water. _Giardia lamblia_ caused 2 outbreaks (MMWR CDC Surveill Summ.
1998;47:1-34). Giardia has been described in a beaver colony (Monzingo
and Hibler. Prevalence of Giardia sp. in a beaver colony and the
resulting environmental contamination. J Wildl Dis. 1987;23:576-85),
but the name "beaver fever" is not commonly used. Rensselaer County is
in NY state.
