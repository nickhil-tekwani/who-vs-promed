2 more sickened by _E. coli_; one has serious complication
----------------------------------------------------------
The number of people sickened by _E. coli_ bacteria linked to a Green Bay
meatpacker has increased to 35, including a 6-year-old Houston County girl
who has developed a life-threatening complication. [A total of 32 of the
35 outbreak victims are from Minnesota. The others were in Wisconsin and Iowa.
The Minnesota Department of Health said Wednesday that 2 more cases have
been diagnosed. Department spokesman Buddy Ferguson said the second case is
a 55-year-old Twin Cities woman. Ferguson said the Houston County girl is
in the hospital after developing an _E. coli_ complication called hemolytic
uremic syndrome. HUS occurs when toxins produced by _E. coli_ cause kidney
damage. Between 2 percent and 7 percent of HUS cases are fatal, according
to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A 2-year-old Dakota
County girl also remains hospitalized with HUS, the Health Department said.
The 55-year-old Twin Cities woman became ill on 22 Nov 2000 but has
recovered, Ferguson said.
Earlier this month, Cub Foods recalled all of its fresh ground beef after
health officials confirmed cases of the food-borne illness and traced them
to ground beef bought at the supermarket. Cub Foods' supplier, American
Foods Group Inc. voluntarily recalled 1.1 million pounds of ground beef
prepared at its Green Bay, Wisconsin plant.
