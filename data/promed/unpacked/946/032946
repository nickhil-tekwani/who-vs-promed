https://www.gov.uk/government/news/avian-flu-outbreak-in-duck-breeding-farm-in-yorkshire


As part of our robust action in response to the confirmed case of avian flu, the culling of 6000 ducks is underway on the affected farm in east Yorkshire. The cull is to prevent the spread of potential infection, and is being carried out in a safe and humane manner by fully trained APHA staff. Our response to this outbreak follows tried and tested procedures for dealing with avian flu outbreaks, and we expect the cull to be completed later today [18 Nov 2014].

Additionally, our animal health laboratory at Weybridge has confirmed that the outbreak in East Yorkshire is the H5N8 strain. The advice from the Chief Medical Officer and Public Health England remains that the risk to public health is very low. The Food Standards Agency have said there is no food safety risk for consumers.

Farming UK understands that scientists have confirmed that the strain found on a 6000-bird duck breeding farm near Driffield in the East Riding of Yorkshire is H5N8. The same strain was found in fattening turkeys in North East Germany and on a poultry [chicken] farm in the village of Hekendorp in the Netherlands, where the authorities have ordered the culling of 150 000 birds.

In Yorkshire, officials from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs [DEFRA] were expected to start culling birds today [18 Nov 2014]. The dead livestock will be sent for rendering. A 10-km exclusion zone has been put in place around the affected farm. Movements of all poultry, products and waste within the restriction zone are banned. Poultry has to be housed or isolated within the zone. Bird gatherings (fairs, shows, exhibitions) are banned, and game birds cannot be released.

Robert Gooch, director of policy with the British Free Range Egg Producers' Association (BFREPA), has urged egg producers to ensure they are maintaining the highest standards of bio-security to minimise the risk of cross-contamination. "We are in touch with DEFRA," he said. "Members should keep up the highest levels of bio-security until we hear more from the department."

The National Farmers' Union (NFU) also issued a statement. The union's chief poultry adviser, Gary Ford, said, "The NFU is working with Defra and Public Health England and understands that the risk to human health from this incident is very low. Defra has introduced a restriction zone, and there will be a cull of birds on the farm."

The European Union, which had already been informed of the outbreaks in Germany and the Netherlands, says it is now aware of the outbreak in the United Kingdom. It said the 3 affected member states were taking necessary measures, including the "culling of the poultry, the establishment of protection and surveillance zones, the introduction of sanitary measures (cleaning and disinfection), the prohibition of movements to sell live poultry, eggs, poultry meat and other poultry products to other EU countries and non-EU countries and the culling of affected flocks only in the restricted zones. The Commission is also informing other EU member states and non-EU countries as well as international organisations about the disease situation and on the measures taken."

[3] Potential routes of introduction

Liz Truss, the Environment Secretary, assured consumers that turkeys, ducks and other poultry are completely safe to eat as Britain suffered its 1st outbreak of bird flu in 6 years.

6000 Pekin ducks being reared at a farm in East Yorkshire where the outbreak occurred are being slaughtered and incinerated as investigators try to establish how the virus got to the UK.

Poultry farmers fear that consumer confidence could be hit as the BP 4.4 billion [USD 6.9 billion] industry gears up for Christmas, its busiest time of year, and public health bodies quickly issued advice that there is no risk from eating poultry.

Asked in Parliament whether she had any advice for consumers ordering Christmas turkeys and other birds, Miss Truss said: "Let's be clear, the Food Standards Agency have said it does not pose a risk for food safety for UK consumers. The chicken and turkey people eat continues to be safe; this is a live animal disease."

But it emerged that avian flu of a type that is highly contagious and deadly for birds almost certainly arrived in the UK a week ago, prompting fears that it could have spread to other farms before containment measures were put in place.

Cherry Valley, the company that manages Nafferton Farm, near Driffield, where the outbreak was confirmed on Saturday [15 Nov 2014] night, rears 7 million ducks every year in the UK and is urgently checking its other sites for any sign of bird flu.

Meanwhile, investigators from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) are trying to find out how the virus got into the country. Cherry Valley has sites in Germany, which along with the Netherlands has suffered its own recent outbreak of bird flu. The company also rears 2.8 billion ducks per year in China, where bird flu is more common.

The 2 most likely causes of the infection are either through wild migratory birds spreading the virus or through droppings from infected birds being transferred by vehicle movements [see comment].

"We are all very concerned," said one farmer based near Nafferton. "It is big business here. These birds were about to go for the Christmas sales. People stand to lose thousands due to this. This will have a huge impact on the local economy. This is the biggest time of year for many of us."

Gary Lavis, chairman of Driffield Parish Council, said a problem was 1st noticed at Nafferton around a week ago, when there was "a drop-off in egg production and slightly higher mortality rates."

Keith Warner, president of the British Veterinary Poultry Association, said it was likely the birds on the farm were infected a week ago, but stressed that the chances of the virus spreading were low. He said: "No live birds have entered or left the farm in the time that the ducks have been ill. This farm breeds birds from the age of 25 weeks to maturity, which is usually between 72 weeks and 2 years, and all of these ducks were 60 weeks old, meaning none have left and none have arrived recently. It's normal for outbreaks to take a few days to identify, because bird flu is not the 1st thing vets will check for. I would stress that in the past, we have never lost control of a bird flu outbreak. The measures we have put in place have always stopped the virus spreading."

New cases of bird flu detected in Europe will likely hit other bird populations and may infect a few people, though the virus is highly unlikely to spread in the human population, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday [18 Nov 2014]

The H5N8 form of the virus has hit a Dutch chicken farm and a German turkey farm. In the UK, officials say the H5N8 strain discovered on a duck breeding farm in East Yorkshire matches the strain found recently in the Netherlands.

Asked if more bird populations were likely to be infected, WHO expert Elizabeth Mumford said: "Absolutely, I would say."

"I think we will probably see some human cases," she told reporters. "I don't see why we wouldn't. If it's really circulating widely, there's no reason we shouldn't see human cases."

H5N8 bird flu has never been known to infect humans before, and many experts in flu virology say the risk to people from this subtype is minimal.

"The risk for humans is always a possibility because of the massive shedding of these viruses by infected chicken flocks, however in my opinion, the chances are very low," said Linda Klavinskis, a specialist in immunobiology at King's College London.

Mumford said there was a possibility of "a few sporadic cases", but people who have caught other H5 subtypes have not passed on the illness to others.

"We believe any time that humans are in close contact with poultry, there's a possibility of transmission to humans," she added. "All of the genes in this virus (H5N8), everywhere we have looked so far, are all avian genes, there's no swine component, and there's no human component to the genome," she said. "Genetic analysis shows that it prefers to bind to avian receptors. It very much remains an avian virus."

If there is a human case, the H5N8 strain has been shown to be susceptible to Roche's flu medicine oseltamivir, also known as Tamiflu, she said.

The outbreak of the disease has grabbed headlines in Europe, and Mumford said the media reaction was "absolutely appropriate" because all countries should be vigilant for outbreaks.

"The 1st thing I always say is that flu viruses are unpredictable. That's the caveat of influenza."

[5] EC decision
Date: Mon 17 Nov 2014
Source: European Commission press release - fact sheet [edited]
http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-14-1888_en.htm


Today [Mon 17 Nov 2014], the Commission adopted 2 emergency safeguard Decisions addressed to The Netherlands and the UK that define the areas that have been placed under stringent veterinary restrictions by those Member States, and where measures according to EU legislation are applied. The measures aim at quickly bringing the disease under control and at preventing the spread of the highly pathogenic avian influenza within the affected Member States, to other Member States and to 3rd countries while minimising the disturbance to trade.

The 2 affected Member States in order to control the spread of the virus are already applying the measures foreseen by Council Directive 2005/94/EC [http://tinyurl.com/pqozd4c]. The measures include the culling of the poultry on the affected holding, the establishment of protection and surveillance zones, the introduction of sanitary measures (cleaning and disinfection), the prohibition of movements to sell live poultry, eggs, poultry meat and other poultry products to other EU countries and non-EU countries and the culling of affected flocks only in the restricted zones. The Commission is also informing other EU Member States and non-EU countries, as well as international organisations about the disease situation and on the measures taken.

The Commission was informed by the Dutch authorities on 15 Nov 2014 of an outbreak of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5 in an indoor flock of 150 000 laying hens. On 16 Nov 2014, the H5N8 virus was confirmed as being the cause. The Netherlands took immediate measures as required under the EU law, which are mentioned above. Given the high density of poultry in some parts, the Commission welcomes the Dutch authorities' additional decision to apply a complete standstill of poultry, eggs and manure from farms throughout The Netherlands as from 11 am on Sun 16 Nov 2014, which allows time to better assess the situation.

Late evening on 16 Nov 2014, the UK authorities informed the Commission of an outbreak of HPAI H5 on an indoor duck breeder farm. The culling of 6000 ducks on the holding is arranged, and the zoning around the outbreak has been applied. Epidemiological investigations are on-going. The information available indicates that the H5 virus in the UK is probably identical to the H5N8 HPAI virus found in The Netherlands and in Germany [as confirmed 18 Nov 2014. - Mod. AS].

Both The Netherlands and the UK are constantly reviewing their measures to take account of the situation on the ground. The Commission is closely liaising with both the UK and the Dutch authorities to receive constant updates on the situation and on the disease control measures adopted.

Today's Decisions will be reviewed by the Standing Committee of EU Member State experts on Thu 20 Nov 2014 (PAFF Committee).

Epidemiological investigations are ongoing to identify the possible source of virus. The fact that the 3 recent outbreaks in Germany, The Netherlands and the UK have occurred in proximity of humid areas with wild birds and the absence of any other possible epidemiological link between them point towards wild migratory bird as a possible source of virus. A species of wild swans might be carrying the virus without showing signs of disease. Member States concerned are evaluating their wild bird surveillance data and are enhancing monitoring. Consequently, the Commission has asked EU Member States to increase bio security on farms.

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states in its risk assessments for the threat of avian influenza risks to humans that the risk of the disease transmitting to humans is low, if all European sanitation protocols are followed. Persons at risk are mainly people in direct contact with or handling diseased chickens e.g. farmers and veterinarians. The risk can be minimised by using appropriate personal protective equipment.

Avian influenza is an infectious viral disease in birds, including poultry. Infections with avian influenza viruses in domestic poultry cause 2 main forms of that disease that are distinguished by their virulence. The low pathogenic form [LPAI] generally only causes mild symptoms, while the highly pathogenic form [HPAI] results in very high mortality rates in most poultry species. That disease may have a severe impact on the profitability of poultry farming.

[While the attribution of the HPAI H5N8 outbreaks in Germany, the Netherlands and UK to transmission by wild migratory birds is very reasonable, a "smoking gun" is yet to be demonstrated (swans?!), and other means of transmission, such as vehicle movements (see in item 3) deserve to be definitely excluded, particularly in relation to the Yorkshire breeding duck farm. Generally, breeding farms are required to implement severe biosecurity measures addressing direct and indirect (e.g. by feed) exposure of their stock to wild birds. They are also required to be distant from other animal farms. In commercial farms (e.g. for egg or poultry meat production), such exposure is more likely to occur, and distances from other farms may be shorter.

Results of the epidemiological investigations in the UK are anticipated with interest. - Mod.AS
