Yellow fever mosquito intercepted at Auckland port
--------------------------------------------------
Public health staff are checking for yellow fever mosquito larvae and have
set up traps at the Ports of Auckland, after they were found in a canoe being
imported from Rarotonga [Cook Islands]. Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry
Quarantine staff found the yellow fever mosquito larvae (_Aedes aegypti_) on
an outrigger canoe being imported for dragon boat racing during routine
inspections at the Ports of Auckland. Although the canoe was inspected before
leaving Rarotonga, the protective plastic covering had been badly damaged,
allowing infestation as the canoe was transported through the Pacific to New
Zealand.
Yellow fever mosquitoes are regarded as the most efficient mosquito
vector of arboviruses. They may be a vector (transmitter) of a number
of diseases of public health significance, such as Barmah Forest
virus, Dengue fever, Ross River virus disease and yellow fever.
The Ministry of Health's Chief Technical Officer for biosecurity
(Health), Sally Gilbert, says: "The canoe where the larvae were found
has been treated with chlorine, as well as other insecticides, and is
being fumigated. We're confident that these measures would have
eradicated any other mosquitoes in the canoe, but the Auckland
Regional Public Health Service has also implemented a program of
enhanced surveillance. Health protection staff have checked the
surrounding area and placed a number of adult and larval mosquito
traps in the vicinity." Health protection staff will monitor the
traps for at least 3 weeks to see whether there is any sign the
mosquitoes may have escaped into the local environment. Ms. Gilbert
said the fact that the exotic mosquitoes have been detected at the
border shows systems are working efficiently, and it means it is less
likely they'll spread in New Zealand.
Exotic mosquitoes of public health significance have been intercepted
on 32 occasions since January 1998.

[Although _Aedes aegypti_ is a well known vector of yellow fever (in
Africa and Latin America), there are many regions of the world having
large populations of this mosquito and no yellow fever. In many
areas, including Australasia, _Ae. aegypti_ would pose more of a
threat of transmitting dengue virus than yellow fever. Similarly,
although the role of _Ae. aegypti_ as a vector of Barmah Forest and
Ross River viruses was mentioned, this mosquito is not regarded as a
major vector of these 2 infections, and, moreover, as far as I know,
neither of these 2 viruses, nor dengue virus, have been recorded from
New Zealand. In fact, New Zealand seems mainly free of mosquito-borne
diseases.
I seriously question the statement that "yellow fever mosquitoes are
the most efficient mosquito vector of arboviruses."
This not the 1st time that _Ae. aegypti_, and other exotic mosquitoes, have
been reported invading ports in New Zealand (see below). But the Health
authorities in New Zealand have a good track record of eradicating exotic
mosquitoes arriving at entry ports. - Mod.MS]
