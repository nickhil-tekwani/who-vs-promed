Pharmacy made mistake in horse drug
-----------------------------------
An official at a Florida pharmacy said on Thursday [23 Apr 2009] the
business incorrectly prepared a supplement given to 21 polo horses that
died over the weekend [19 Apr 2009] while preparing to play in a
championship match. Jennifer Beckett of Franck's Pharmacy in Ocala,
Florida, told The Associated Press in a statement that the business
conducted an internal investigation that found "the strength of an
ingredient in the medication was incorrect." The statement did not say what
the ingredient was. Beckett, the pharmacy's chief operating officer, said
the pharmacy is cooperating with an investigation by state authorities and
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

The horses from the Venezuelan-owned Lechuza polo team began crumpling to
the ground shortly before Sunday's [19 Apr 2009] US Open match was supposed
to begin, shocking a crowd of well-heeled spectators at the International
Polo Club Palm Beach in Wellington.

"On an order from a veterinarian, Franck's Pharmacy prepared medication
that was used to treat the 21 horses on the Lechuza Polo team," Beckett
said. "As soon as we learned of the tragic incident, we conducted an
internal investigation." She said the report has been given to state
authorities.

Lechuza also issued a statement to AP acknowledging that a Florida
veterinarian wrote the prescription for the pharmacy to create a compound
similar to Biodyl, a French-made supplement that includes vitamins and
minerals and is not approved for use in the United States. "Only horses
treated with the compound became sick and died within 3 hours of
treatment," Lechuza said in the statement. "Other horses that were not
treated remain healthy and normal."

Lechuza also said it was cooperating with authorities that include the
State Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services and the Palm Beach
County Sheriff's Office.

Biodyl contains a combination of vitamin B12, a form of selenium called
sodium selenite, and other minerals. It is made in France by Duluth,
Georgia based animal pharmaceutical firm Merial Ltd. and can be given to
horses to help with exhaustion. It is widely used abroad, but not approved
in the US.

Compound pharmacies can, among other things, add flavor, make substances
into a powder or liquid or remove a certain compound that may have an
adverse reaction in different animal species. Only in limited circumstances
can they legally recreate a drug that is not approved in the US, according
to the FDA.

Necropsies of the 21 horses found internal bleeding, some in the lungs, but
offered no definitive clues to the cause of death. FDA spokeswoman Siobhan
DeLancey said compounding pharmacies cannot legally recreate existing drugs
or supplements under patent. In most cases, they are also not allowed to
recreate a medication that is not approved for use in the US.

On its website, the FDA says it generally defers to "state authorities
regarding the day-to-day regulation of compounding by veterinarians and
pharmacists." However, the agency says it would "seriously consider
enforcement action" if a pharmacy breaks federal law in compounding
medications. It isn't yet clear Franck's broke the law.

[The compounding company does not tell us what else is in the product used.

Selenium has not been shown to be the cause of the problem, but it could be
responsible and therefore some information regarding the form of selenium
used in this compound may be appropriate. Sodium selenite is the most water
soluble form of selenium. However, that same form of selenium -- along with
zinc and barium salts -- has been used in paints. In microgram quantities
it has been used to study cataracts in mice. And while selenium is a
necessary micronutrient, in excess it can cause harm.

Regarding the toxicity of selenium (Se), 1-5 mg Se/kg body weight orally is
acutely toxic, while parenterally 0.2 mg Se/ kg body weight is acutely
toxic. A single minimal lethal dose of oral sodium selenite in horses is
3.3 mg/kg, but will be much less than that for a parenteral preparation.

We look forward to learning what the agent was and in what concentration. -
