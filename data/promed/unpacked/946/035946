[A man] of St Joseph county came down with Rocky Mountain spotted fever after he was bit by a tick in Illinois. Doctors say you can catch it in Indiana as well. [He] man is recovering after picking up one of the deadliest tick-borne diseases in the world.

He was diagnosed with Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Early treatment of this disease can prevent death or serious illness. The problem with this type -- and other types of tick-borne diseases -- is they often start out like the flu, so they can be misdiagnosed. But in [this man]'s case, he remembered something that helped doctors make a quick diagnosis. He is an avid outdoorsman who says he spends most of his free time outside. He and his friends traveled to southern Illinois for a long weekend away. "Everything on your back," he told WSBT 22. "Bring everything in everything out. 3 nights in the woods and try to survive."

[He] didn't realize his biggest challenge wouldn't be on that trip. It would be more than a week after he got home. "I didn't think anything of it the 1st couple days. You just think it's a normal headache. Cold-flu symptoms." But those symptoms got worse. [He] experienced terrible joint pain, extreme sweating and fatigue, and trouble concentrating. At one point, he ended up in the ER. "I just went thinking it was just the flu, but in the back of my mind I knew I had been bitten by the ticks," [he] said. "So that was the main thing that made me want to make sure it was that."

That is what saved him. Doctors immediately took blood tests and put him on a strong antibiotic before diagnosing him with Rocky Mountain spotted fever. If left untreated, it can be deadly. In fact, it is the same disease that killed an Indiana toddler last year [2017] after she was misdiagnosed.

Doctors say if you are going to be outside, use repellent and check yourself for ticks. While not everyone who gets bit by a tick gets sick, doctors say you should let your physician know. That's why [this man] is on the mend and on to his next adventure. Although he will be making some changes, saying he will have awareness and take preventative measures. [He] and his friends are going to be using a solution called permethrin, which you dunk your clothes and gear in and it is supposed to repel and kill ticks [Permethrin kills ticks and mosquitoes on contact with treated fabric, such as clothing or bed nets, but DEET (that is, N,N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide or diethyltoluamide) is the most common agent applied to the skin to protect against ticks].

Thousands of cases of Rocky Mountain spotted fever are diagnosed in the US every year. In Indiana over the last few years there have been more than 160 cases diagnosed.

Doctors are required to report cases to the county health department. Numbers are tracked by the CDC. You can get this in Indiana. It is transmitted by the American dog tick, which lives in wooded areas and tall grassy fields. It is here in Indiana. Most cases happen in the southern part of the state. Also, cases are reported by county [that is "the jurisdiction of the person's 'usual residence' at the time of disease or condition onset (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/11-SI-04.pdf)"] and may not reflect where the person got it.

[The following has been mostly extracted from my moderator comments in ProMED-mail post Rocky Mountain spotted fever - USA (04): (MI) susp 20170904.5293271:

Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) is a nationally reportable, tickborne illness caused by the bacterium _Rickettsia rickettsii_ and transmitted in the United States by one of several species of ticks that include the American dog tick (_Dermacentor variabilis_), the Rocky Mountain wood tick (_Dermacentor andersoni_), and the brown dog tick (_Rhipicephalus sanguineus_). A picture of a female _Dermacentor variabilis_ can be found at http://tinyurl.com/y92ulu5e. Ticks can become infected by feeding on blood of infected small mammals and once infected, the female tick can transmit the infection to her offspring.

The illness in humans is characterized by fever, headache, and skin rash that first appears on the wrists, forearms, and ankles and then spreads to include palms and soles, and the trunk. However, some people never develop the rash. A picture of the skin rash can be seen at http://tinyurl.com/ycyrbd5a. The rash can become progressively more purpuric and rarely evolve into purpura fulminans associated with consumptive coagulopathy, disseminated intravascular clotting, multiorgan failure, and shock (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/362535). RMSF is potentially fatal if not treated promptly with an appropriate antibiotic. Doxycycline is the antibiotic of choice for both adults and children of any age and should be started when the diagnosis is first suspected.

The diagnosis of RMSF is confirmed by an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) performed on 2 serum samples taken 3 weeks apart, the 1st sample being low or negative and the 2nd showing a 4-fold increase in IgG antibody levels. IgM antibodies usually rise at the same time as IgG but are less specific and more likely to represent a false positive (https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/resources/TickborneDiseases.pdf).

Because of the inability of the commonly available serologic tests to differentiate between spotted fever group rickettsial species, as of 1 Jan 2010, cases of RMSF have been reported under a new category called spotted fever rickettsiosis (SFR). SFR includes RMSF, _R. parkeri_ rickettsiosis, Pacific Coast tick fever (caused by _R. philippi_), and rickettsialpox (caused by _R. akari_). Inclusion of these less severe spotted fevers has likely lead to some extent to the increased incidence and the lower case fatality rate observed in recent decades (https://www.cdc.gov/rmsf/stats/index.html). Incidence of RMSF has increased from less than 2 cases per million people in 2000 to more than 11 cases per million in 2014, according to the CDC and the proportion of RMSF cases resulting in death, known as the case fatality rate, has dropped to less than 0.5 percent (https://www.cdc.gov/rmsf/stats/index.html). Of the thousands of cases of spotted fever group rickettsiosis that occur every year, it is unclear exactly how many of these cases are RMSF and how many result from the other, less severe spotted fevers.

The patient in the news report above, resides in Indiana, but was said to have been bitten by a tick in Illinois. SFR cases are reported throughout the United States, but Illinois falls in the group of US states with the highest incidence (6.6 to 278 cases per million people in 2014). The best way to prevent RMSF is avoiding tick bites (https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/prev/on_people.html). - Mod.ML
