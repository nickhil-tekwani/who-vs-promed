Alamosa officials plan to reopen city schools tomorrow [31 Mar 2008]
as crews continue flushing the city water system to purge salmonella
bacteria. The schools closed Tuesday [25 Mar 2008], when officials
began pumping high concentrations of chlorine into the water. Adams
State College closed Wednesday [26 Mar 2008].

Chlorine levels in parts of the city have dropped to where residents
can take quick showers, but it is still unsuitable for drinking. In
other parts, city water can only be used to flush toilets. Since 19
Mar 19 2008, residents have been told not to use water straight from
the tap, after bacteria was found. The source of contamination is unknown.

There have been at least 85 confirmed cases of salmonella and 315
people sickened.

State health officials say the salmonellosis strain that has
contaminated Alamosa's municipal water supply and sickened nearly 300
people is the same strain found locally in birds, deer and other
warm-blooded animals. Officials are investigating whether bird or
animal droppings might have contaminated the water.

The southern Colorado city is flushing its water system with
chlorine. People won't be able to drink the water until high
concentrations of the disinfecting chemical washes out of the water system.

The 1st salmonella victim began showing symptoms 7 Mar 2008, and
state health officials became aware of the outbreak about a week later.

[_S. enterica_ serotype Typhimurium is a common serotype involved in
salmonellosis and is clearly a zoonosis. This posting does not
specifically state that the strain found in the patients genetically
matches a zoonotic isolate. The mechanism of contamination remains unknown.
