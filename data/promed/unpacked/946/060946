[This report confirms Mod.AS's suggestion (in Foot & mouth disease -
Russia (Chitinskaya) (03) 20060126.0247) that the serotype was Asia
1, as has been found in previous outbreaks near the Chinese border.
Chitinskaya is in Eastern Siberia near the border with Mongolia and
China. The veterinary authorities working on this outbreak deserve
kudos for just getting the samples for diagnosis, as the temperature
these days can drop to -50 C. - Mod.PC]
