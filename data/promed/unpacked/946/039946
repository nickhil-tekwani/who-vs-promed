[Yellow fever cases in Argentina have been reported rarely, but there have been previous reports of cases in northern Argentina, especially Misiones province. The widely scattered cases reported from 7 provinces would be unusual, if they are confirmed.

If these suspected and probable cases are confirmed as yellow fever (YF) virus infections, it would be of interest to know more details such as the specific dates of their infections, the ecological setting in which the YF virus infections were acquired (presumably forest habitats), the sex and age of the individuals and the outcome of the infections. It would also be of interest to know why the recently vaccinated individual became infected, assuming that this probable case becomes laboratory confirmed and is not discarded.
