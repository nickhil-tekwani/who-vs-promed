I [would like to give some general comments with regard to the report of
water-associated tularemia in Spain. I am a researcher actively working on
_F. tularensis_ and also on the diagnosis of tularemia. My colleagues and I
have been following the literature and published a few publications on the
clinical entities of tularemia in Scandinavia.
First, I would like to stress that tularemia definitely has an association
with water in several parts of the world. For example, from 1936 to 1963, at
least 30 outbreaks of water-borne tularemia were reported from the Soviet
Union (Pollitzer, R. History and incidence of tularemia in Soviet
Union -- a review. Institute for Contemporary Russian Studies,
Fordham University, Bronx, New York, 1967).
To a considerable extent, these outbreaks have been associated with
the oropharyngeal form of the disease. Moreover, there are reports
from Italy of a few outbreaks clearly associated with water and we
have described a Swedish outbreak associated with a contaminated well
used as a source for drinking water (T Sigmarnvik et al. Infrequent
manifestations of tularemia in Sweden. Scand. J. Inf. Dis. 1997;29:
443-446.).
However, all of the above mentioned reports refer to spread of tularemia
after drinking contaminated water. Although there is good evidence that
muskrats and beavers are susceptible, I am not aware of any reports
documenting the spread of tularemia directly from aquatic animals, crayfish,
etc to humans. The possibility still cannot be ruled out that the water
itself was heavily contaminated, e.g., if it is slowly flowing and dead
animals (muskrats, beavers) are found upstream. The clinical symptoms are
compatible with direct hand-contact as the primary route of entry (100%
showed hand-finger ulcerations). Due to the contagiousness of the bacterium,
direct contact could probably be sufficient to contract disease if the water
is heavily contaminated. The same type of symptoms are seen in Scandinavia
in individuals who have touched dead animals.

Thus, I would like to conclude that the presented evidence is compatible
with the diagnosis of tularemia. However, it would be of definite interest
to obtain additional verification by repeated serological investigation
using the highly specific ELISAs available at reference laboratories.
