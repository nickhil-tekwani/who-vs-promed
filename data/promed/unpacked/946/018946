[1] 63rd death confirmed

A 6-year-old Indonesian girl who died 6 days ago had bird flu, an
official at the Health Ministry said on Thu 26 Jan 2007, taking the
country's death toll from the disease to 63.
Indonesia, which has the world's highest number of human fatalities
from avian influenza, has been trying to step up efforts to stamp out
the disease after a flare up in cases this year [2007] following a brief lull.
"There has been another H5N1 fatality case, a 6-year-old girl from
central Java. According to information, her neighbours had dead
chickens," said Ahmad Priyatna of the ministry's bird flu information
centre. He said the victim died in a hospital in Yogyakarta last Fri
19 Jan 2007]; 6 people have died of the disease so far in 2007 in
Indonesia, where the virus is endemic in poultry in many provinces.
In South Sulawesi province, 5 people with bird flu symptoms have been
hospitalised for testing, a doctor said. Their health was improving,
said Khalid Saleh, a doctor in charge of the bird flu ward at Wahidin
Sudirohusodo hospital in the provincial capital, Makassar. "They
come from the same neighbourhood. It was said chickens have died in
the area," he told Reuters.
Indonesia, the world's 4th-most-populous country that stretches
across 17 000 islands, faces an uphill task in fighting the virus.
Millions of backyard fowl live in close proximity to humans and
keeping backyard chickens is ingrained in Indonesia's culture. Health
education campaigns have often been patchy and rules difficult to
enforce. Contact with sick fowl is the most common way people are
infected. Bird flu remains essentially an animal disease. With the
latest case, 270 people worldwide have been infected by it since late
2003, killing 164 of them.

[2] Confirmed and suspected patients

As of Sun 21 2007, Arf (male, 18) has recovered from avian flu and
has been moved to an ordinary ward, a team of doctors at Persahabatan
Hospital, East Jakarta, said. Chairman of the team of doctors in
charge of bird flu patients Dr Mochtar Ikhsan said here on Wed 24 Jan
2007 that Arf still has to be treated for his leukocyte count, which
is not yet normal. "He is now no longer an AI (avian influenza)
patient," Ikhsan said.
At present, there are 4 AI suspects being treated at an isolated
ward. They are As (male, 30), Rh (female, 26), R (female, 42) and F
(5). F checked in Wednesday morning, The patient was formerly treated
at a hospital in Kemang, South Jakarta.
"We have permitted As and Rh to leave the hospital for home today
(Wed 24 Jan 2007) as their 3 PCRs turned out negative, " Dr Ikhsan
said. Arf's mother is Ryh, who was a positive AI patient and who died
on 2 Jan 2007. Now doctors at Persahabatan were told that residents
in Arf's neighborhood at Seerpong tend to isolate the family. Arf's
father was also treated as an AI suspect but was not proven ill
following 3 PRC tests.
Hospital doctors and staff will shortly visit Pondok Jagung Serpong
to make things clear. It should be known that caution should be taken
against poultry, not humans affected by or suspected of AI. Arf did
not get the H5N1 virus from his mother but from a chicken. Infection
goes from bird to men, not from human to human.
