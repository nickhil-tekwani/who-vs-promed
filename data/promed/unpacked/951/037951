Over a 6-year period, levofloxacin-resistant _Haemophilus influenzae_ increased significantly in Taiwan, primarily driven by the spread of several clones in the elderly population in different regions, according to surveillance data.

"We studied a large number of levofloxacin-resistant _H. influenzae_ from clinical diagnostic samples of multiple hospitals in different regions of Taiwan, so physicians should take into account the high rate of fluoroquinolone resistance when they prescribe empirical therapy for _H. influenzae_ infections," the authors wrote in their study published in Emerging Infectious Diseases [1]. "Surveillance and intervention measures should be directed at the risk groups identified in this study to halt the increase in fluoroquinolone resistance in _H. influenzae_."

Shu-Chen Kuo, MD, and colleagues analyzed data from the Taiwan Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance (TSAR), a biennial nationwide surveillance program [1].

From 2004-2010, 1462 nonduplicate _H. influenzae_ isolates were collected from 26 hospitals involved in the TSAR program. The resistance rate for levofloxacin rose from 2 percent in 2004 to 24.2 percent in 2010 (P less than 0.001). Resistance to sparfloxacin (no longer available in the US) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole also increased steadily and significantly during the study period.

The researchers found these levofloxacin-resistant isolates more often in elderly patients, from respiratory origins, from regional hospitals and inpatient settings and from central and southern Taiwan. "We found age and regional differences in this resistance phenotype, which might have resulted from differences in fluoroquinolone use and patient populations," the authors wrote.

While other surveillance data from around the world have found low fluoroquinolone resistance in _H. influenza_, fluoroquinolone resistance has been reported. A fluoroquinolone-resistant _H. influenzae_ moved through a hospital-affiliated long-term care facility in New York in 2001; nearly all of the resistant isolates were related to a single clone [2]. From 2002 to 2004, resistance rates increased from 0.5 percent to 2.6 percent in Hokkaido, Japan [3].

In this study, isolates of the same pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) cluster had similar mutation patterns. "Therefore, the emergence of fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates may be the result of several clones spreading in the same region," the authors wrote.

The researchers did find isolates in the same PFGE cluster with the same sequence typing (ST) but different quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDR) mutations. "In addition, nearly all of the levofloxacin-resistant _H. influenzae_ isolates belong to 7 previously unreported STs or their single locus variants," the authors wrote. "This finding indicates that the emergence of levofloxacin-resistant isolates likely occurred through spontaneous mutation of hypermutable clones under selective pressure, and these clones then disseminated locally in each region."

[_Haemophilus influenzae_ are Gram negative coccobacilli that are either encapsulated or non-encapsulated. There are 6 antigenically distinct capsular polysaccharide types, designated a-f. Type b strains are important invasive pathogens in non-immune humans, particularly in infants, causing meningitis, bacteremia, epiglottitis, facial cellulitis, pneumonia, empyema, and septic arthritis. Since the widespread use of conjugate _H. influenzae_ type b (HiB) vaccines in infants and children there has been a dramatic decrease in incidence of invasive infections due to HiB. Unencapsulated (AKA nontypable) _H. influenzae_ strains are unaffected by the Hib vaccine and now cause the majority of invasive _H. influenzae_ disease in all age groups (http://www.cdc.gov/hi-disease/clinicians.html). Unencapsulated _H. influenzae_ frequently colonize the lower respiratory tract of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or cystic fibrosis and are a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia in elderly persons and otitis media and sinusitis in children.

Fluoroquinolones are widely used for the treatment of respiratory tract and urinary tract infections in the community, in hospitals, and long-term care facilities (LTCFs), so the emergence of fluoroquinolone-resistant _H. influenzae_ is a concern; and because fluoroquinolones are used widely, it is not surprising that the selection of resistance to the fluoroquinolones has occurred.

Fluoroquinolone resistance is chromosome-mediated and involves mutations in a particular domain referred to as the quinolone-resistance-determining region (QRDR) of one or both target genes that encode DNA gyrase (gyrA and gyrB genes) and topoisomerase IV (parC and parE genes). Mutations tend to occur in a stepwise manner: The MICs (minimum inhibitory concentration) of mutant strains increase with each additional mutation in the target sites. Once resistance is selected, fluoroquinolone-resistant strains can disseminate rapidly and widely in the community (such as day care centers), hospitals and LTCF by cross-transmissions.

However, fluoroquinolone (such as levofloxacin) resistance was not observed among _H. influenzae_ in a survey conducted in 1999 among 1097 isolates of _H. influenzae_ from patients with community-acquired respiratory tract infections in North America (1) and again between 2008 and 2010 among 1545 isolates of _H. influenzae_ (1545 isolates) cultured from patient infections in the United States (2).
