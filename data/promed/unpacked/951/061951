The Ministry of Health in China has confirmed the country's 8th case
of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. The patient
is a 6-year-old boy from the southern province of Hunan. He developed
symptoms of fever and pneumonia on 24 Dec 2005 and is presently
hospitalized in stable condition.
Chinese authorities have also reported that 2 cases, previously
announced, have subsequently died. The deaths occurred in a
10-year-old girl from the Guangxi region, reported on 7 Dec 2005, and
a 35-year-old man from Jiangxi Province, reported on 16 Dec 2005.
Of the 8 confirmed cases in China, 5 have now died.
Initial investigation of the newly confirmed case has identified
recent poultry deaths in the family flock as the likely source of
exposure, though no poultry outbreaks have been officially reported
in the area. Close contacts have been placed under medical
observation and none has shown symptoms of infection to date.
This is the 2nd confirmed case from Hunan Province. The earlier Hunan
case, which was one of the 1st 2 reported in China in mid-November
2005, lived around 300 kilometres away from the present case.
In addition to Hunan, provinces and regions reporting human cases of
H5N1 infection include Anhui, Guangxi, Liaoning, Jiangxi, and Fujian.
