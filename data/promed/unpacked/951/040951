[2] Saudi Arabia - media report

Saudi Arabia registered 35 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) corona virus cases in 15 days, of which 28 developed the infection at health facilities, officials said on Sunday [11 Jun 2017].

Although the MERS corona virus cases are not anymore considered a high health risk like before, the infection could be fatal for those with poor health or chronic diseases, Xinhua news agency reported.

The country has registered 1577 cases since 2012, including 672 deaths. [As stated in [1] above, the numbers I have been citing come from a spreadsheet I have maintained and includes asymptomatic contacts found to be infected with the MERS-CoV. - Mod.MPP]

Infection control consultant Mohammed Abdulrahman highlighted the need for more awareness on infection control measures at health facilities as most of the new cases could have been prevented.

He urged the elderly to avoid visiting patients at hospitals or be directly associated with camels which are the main source of the virus, because of their weak immune systems.

[The nosocomial outbreak(s) in Riyadh continue. Over the past 2 days there have been 6 newly confirmed MERS-CoV infections in Riyadh. All 6 were classified as secondary healthcare acquired cases with one in a patient and the remaining 5 in healthcare workers. All of the healthcare workers were listed as expatriates, while the affected patient was a Saudi nationality. Of these 6 cases, 1 involved a fatality (the case in a patient), 2 were reported to be stable condition and 3 were reported to be asymptomatic individuals identified through contact tracing.

We do not have more details on the actual number of healthcare facilities involved with nosocomial transmission at this time, nor do we know the division of the cases/infections reported to date by healthcare facility. That being said, since the beginning of May 2017 there have been a total of 44 newly confirmed MERS-CoV infections in Riyadh of whom 30 (68.2 percent) were reported to have been asymptomatic contacts of other known MERS-CoV infected individuals. Five of the 44 cases were classified as primary cases with an additional case not as yet classified, and only one case had a history of direct contact with camels. Two of the cases were in household contacts and the remaining 36 cases were classified as secondary healthcare acquired cases with 10 occurring in patients, and 26 occurring in healthcare workers. Of note, 4 of the 44 (9 percent) were reported to have died, 5 (11 percent) were reported to have recovered, and the remaining 35 are still active cases with outcome information still pending. We do not know if any of the reported "asymptomatic" infected individuals have gone on to have clinical disease consistent with MERS-CoV infection.

Note that I've included the media report on this increase in reported cases/infections with MERS-CoV as an indication of the concern the country is experiencing as 35 cases reported in 15 days is a significant departure from the previous "trickle" of reported cases.

We await further details on this outbreak (or these outbreaks).
