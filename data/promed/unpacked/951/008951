In an unexpected turn with the city of Buffalo's deer management
program, 2 of the deer harvested within city limits last week [week
of 15 Nov 2010] tested positive for chronic wasting disease [CWD].

Buffalo police chief Mike Chapman stated that the positive tests were
a surprise and that the meat from the 2 deer will not be distributed
to the public as planned. "We had 2 deer that tested positive for
chronic wasting and we will not be giving those deer away," Chapman
said. "They're not going to be given to anybody."

According to Warren Mischke with the Wyoming Game & Fish Department,
the city of Buffalo is located in Hunt Area 27 and this is not the
1st confirmed test of CWD in the area. "We had a positive test in
2008 from a white-tailed deer taken south of Lake DeSmet," Mischke
said. "As far as I can remember this is the 1st time that we've had a
positive test in city limits."

CWD is a brain disease known to affect deer, elk, and moose, with no
known-cases of it spreading outside those animals. "There has never
been a case where it has spread to animals other than elk, deer, and
moose," Mischke said.

Outside of the 2 positive tests, Chapman said the rest of the
harvested deer would be distributed soon.

"We are working down the list of people that signed up and we started
giving the meat away this week [week of 22 Nov 2010]," Chapman said
adding the sign-up list for the meat filled quickly. "We had over 50
people sign-up to get on the list for the free meat. I thought we'd
be lucky if we got 20. I think that kind of shows that the community
is still under stress as far as money goes."

Two weeks ago the Game & Fish issued 75 permits to the city of
Buffalo to harvest deer in the city limits in an effort to curtail
the population growth seen in the last few years. The permits are
good until [31 Dec 2010]. "Out of those 75 we are still giving some
of the meat to the food pantry, so we won't be giving it to everyone
on the list." Chapman said. "We have been concentrating on the south
side of the city and we're hoping that the next batch of tests don't
come back with positive results."

[If the city is in an area with previous cases of CWD it should be no
surprise to find infected deer there. The deer are likely within
their home range and the city just happens to be within their home
range. Furthermore, most cities provide some type of feeding for the
deer. Many people enjoy watching them and therefore are likely to
feed them. - Mod.TG]
