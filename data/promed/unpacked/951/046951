The official dengue count in Webb County (Laredo is in Webb County) to date
is 5 cases -- 4 in patients who had traveled to Nuevo Laredo [Mexico and
one in a patient who denies travel in the 2 weeks prior to onset of illness.
Several suspect cases are under investigation.
Any new predictions? [See [03 below - Mod.JW

The question of Laredo's weather and its connection to dengue raised some
interesting issues, demonstrated by the two respondents different
perspectives (J Lentino and Ruth Sponsler).
_Aedes_ sp. require very little water to breed -- dog dishes, puddles
formed under air-conditioners, dishes under plant pots, water standing in
gutters, etc. Heavy rains are not necessarily required for adequate _Aedes_
breeding environments. Further, hot weather facilitates formation of the
these small pools of water -- possibly air-conditioner condensation, people
making sure their dog's dish is full but never changing the water, making
sure plants have adequate water, and so on.
But there are some other issues to consider. If these cases are truly
locally acquired, then how did dengue come to be in Laredo in the first
place? To pursue the climate hypothesis, have conditions south of Laredo
and Neuvo Laredo changed to favor emergence of dengue such that local labor
circulation has brought dengue further north? Is dengue imported daily from
Nuevo Laredo where perhaps less adequate urban drainage creates a true urban
dengue environment (one that probably does not really exist in Laredo)?
_Aedes_ sp. [flight range is such that all the mosquitos could possibly
come from Nuevo Laredo.
Finally, what, if anything, does Laredo's public health department plan to
do about this? The options range from simply educating people about the
risks associated with mosquito bites to vector control, ranging from
emptying all small sources of standing water to [insecticide spraying.
These thoughts are not meant to be definitive at all, my hope is to widen
the discussion's scope.

The greatest single menace of hurricane Bret may be an upsurge in the number
of cases of dengue north of the Rio Grande River. Texans were very thankful
that the hurricane made landfall in Kennedy County, which is the least
populated county on the Gulf Coast. However, the rains generated from
Hurricane Bret fell in the area where dengue cases have occurred.
