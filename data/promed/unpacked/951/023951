From: Bandyopadhyay R <R.BANDYOPADHYAY@CGIAR.ORG>

I am a plant pathologist at the International Crops Research Institute for
the Semi-Arid Tropics. My research interest is in ergot disease of sorghum,
and you may find some of my postings on the disease when it was first
observed in Brazil in 1996. The ergot pathogen in Brazil and other parts of
South America and North America is _Claviceps africana_. Two other species
of sorghum ergot also occur. These are _C. sorghi_ in India and _C.
sorghicola_ in Japan. Currently, I am studying the population structure of
the sorghum ergot pathogen in India. This is part of a global study
coordinated by Dr. Paul Tooley of USDA's Foreign Disease and Weed Sciences
Research Unit based in Maryland. One of the methods to distinguish the
three sorghum ergot species is to determine the presence of dihydroergosine
in the sclerotial tissue of the pathogen. Unfortunately, the alkaloid
dihydroergosine is not marketed by more popular vendors such as Sigma or
Thomas Scientific. Without using authentic dihydroergosine as standard, I
cannot perform appropriate analysis. I have searched the internet and found
that dihydroergosine is used by medical research scientists.
I would like to request you if you can let me know of any company (or
scientist) that I can contact for obtaining the alkaloid dihydroergosine or
any lab where I can get the analysis done on charge basis. Can you help me?
