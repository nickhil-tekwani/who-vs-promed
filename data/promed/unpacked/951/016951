Malaria in Penang associated with construction workers from Myanmar
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Penang is concerned about the "alarming" rate of malaria cases in the state
with 13 cases reported in the 1st week of the new year [2009].

State Health, Welfare and Caring Society Committee chairman Phee Boon Poh
said that only one of the 13 cases was a Malaysian while the rest were
foreign workers, mainly Myanmars, who worked in the construction industry.
"The cases detected were mainly concentrated in the Bukit Gambier area,
Bukit Papan in Bayan Lepas, Bukit Serai in Paya Terubong, and the
construction sites of the Surin-Bolton Apartments project and the Taman
Ratu Mutiara project in Tanjung Bungah," he told reporters.

Phee said most of the foreigners were believed to have contracted the
vectorborne disease at hills and jungles where their workers' huts are
located. "The next morning, when these workers come downhill for work
purposes, they also indirectly help spread the disease to locals," he said.

Phee said the state Health Department was taking precautions by carrying
out fogging at the affected sites while the Penang Municipal Council (MPPP)
was sending out officers to the ground, especially at hill sites, to
destroy mosquito breeding grounds. He advised residents living in hill
sites to ensure the cleanliness of their surrounding areas and also to go
to the nearest hospital for blood tests and vaccine shots [no vaccine for
malaria yet, alas. - Mod.SH] if they suspected they had contracted the
disease. "The state also wants employers at fruit orchards, plantations,
and construction sites to get their foreign workers vaccinated and to
contact the authorities as soon as possible so that immediate measures
could be taken to contain the spread of the disease," he said.

He also urged clinics and doctors to cooperate and to alert the state
health authorities if they came across any such cases. "These foreign
workers especially the illegal ones, may try to avoid detection for fear of
being deported but the state is more concerned about their health rather
than their legal status," he said.

Phee also said the state was closely monitoring the 3 reported chikungunya
cases here especially those in the sensitive areas in the North-East,
South-West, and Central Seberang Prai (SPT) districts. "The 1st week of the
year [2009] also saw 60 dengue cases being reported with 9 confirmed
cases," he said. He said the state Health Department and the MPPP were
taking the necessary measures by carrying out fogging and clean-up activities.

[The latest data reported to the WHO are from 2003, when the overall rate
was 1.8 per 1000 population per year and 69 per cent of cases were reported
from Sabah and Sarawak (see
<http://rbm.who.int/wmr2005/profiles/malaysia.pdf>).

Malaria is endemic in Myanmar. This report does not specify, but
_Plasmodium falciparum_ is the commonest species of malarial parasite in
Myanmar. It is probable that infested construction workers have initiated a
limited local transmission. This has been seen in the Dominican Republic
and Bahamas Islands. Regular checks for malaria of immigrant workers and
treatment of positive cases would prevent some secondary cases. - Mod.EP
