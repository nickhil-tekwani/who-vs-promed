A record 272 cases of infections with tick-borne [TBE] encephalitis have been reported in Switzerland over the past 12 months, according to the Federal Office of Public Health. Compared with the same period in 2016/2017, this is an increase of 3 cases.

The office says the number of serious cases also reached record levels, to 5.39 per 100 000 people from 1.42 per 100 000 people in 2015.

The number of doctor's appointments because of tick bites and bacterial infections were also up considerably in a long-term comparison.

The health authorities have recommended that people who live in at-risk areas, where the disease is endemic, get vaccinated against the virus.

About 1 percent of tick-borne encephalitis cases are fatal. Bacterial infections can be treated with antibiotics, according to experts.

In Switzerland, the tick season starts in March and ends in November, depending on the weather. The health office says ticks are found mainly in deciduous forests with heavy undergrowth and at an altitude of up to 1500 metres [4920 ft].

[The number of tick-borne encephalitis cases in Switzerland have increased from 230 on 24 Jul 2018 to 272 in the report above. As noted earlier, the virus is endemic (and expanding) in certain areas of the country as well as in some areas of Germany and Austria. In a comment last year (2017) concerning TBE in Switzerland, Dr Ivo M Foppa indicated that the incidence of TBE in Switzerland has increased distinctly since 2000, roughly about 50 percent. Comparing the time period from 1985 through 2000 (average reported number of TBE per year 66) with the period from 2001 through 2016 (average reported number of TBE per year 138), the trend is even more obvious.

WHO has stated that "Approximately 10 000-12 000 clinical cases of tick-borne encephalitis are reported each year, but this figure is believed to be significantly lower than the actual total. Immunization offers the most effective protection. Currently, there are 4 widely used vaccines of assured quality: FSME-Immun and Encepur, manufactured in Austria and Germany, respectively, and based on European strains of the virus; and TBE-Moscow and EnceVir, manufactured in the Russian Federation and based on Far-Eastern strains. The 4 vaccines are considered to be safe and efficacious." (http://www.who.int/immunization/topics/tick_encephalitis/en/)

Tick-borne encephalitis is a virus infection caused by one of 3 tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) subtypes belonging to the Flaviviridae family: Central European, Siberian, and Far Eastern (formerly known as Russian spring-summer encephalitis). It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected _Ixodes_ ticks. - Mod.TY
