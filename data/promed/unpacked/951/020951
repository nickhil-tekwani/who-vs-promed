Missed Opportunities for Tetanus Postexposure Prophylaxis -- California, January 2008-March 2014
---------------------------------------
Tetanus is an acute and sometimes fatal disease characterized by sudden muscle contractions. The number of tetanus cases reported annually in the USA has declined significantly since the 1930s and 1940s as a result of the introduction of tetanus vaccines (1). However, sporadic cases continue to occur in persons who are not up-to-date with tetanus toxoid-containing vaccinations (TT) and do not receive appropriate postexposure prophylaxis (PEP). To assess the extent of these cases, the California Department of Public Health reviewed all tetanus cases reported during January 2008-March 2014. A total of 21 tetanus patients were reported; 5 (24 percent) died. An average of 3 cases were reported each year during 2008-2013; the average annual incidence among patients aged 65 years or higher (0.23 cases per 1 million population) was twice that among patients aged 21-64 years (0.10 cases per 1 million population). Of 16 patients with an acute injury before illness and diagnosis, 9 (56 percent) sought medical care, and 2 (22 percent) of the 9 received appropriate PEP. Although tetanus is rare, it is a life-threatening disease that is preventable. Health care providers should ensure that their patients are up-to-date with TT vaccination and provide appropriate postexposure prophylaxis for patients with wounds.

During 2008-2010, a confirmed case was defined by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) as a patient with acute onset of hypertonia or painful muscular contractions (usually of the muscles of the jaw and neck) and generalized muscle spasms without other apparent medical cause. In 2010, CSTE removed the "confirmed" classification and defined all clinically compatible cases as probable. The California Department of Public Health analyzed all confirmed and probable cases in accordance with CSTE case definitions. Using the CDC tetanus surveillance worksheet, local health department and California Department of Public Health staff reviewed case surveillance and medical record data, including demographics, clinical presentation and course, vaccination status, and wound management. Vaccination and wound data were reviewed to determine whether health care providers followed wound management and PEP recommendations (2,3). Tetanus incidence rates were calculated using population estimates from the California Department of Finance. Hospitalization costs were estimated using discharge data from the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development.

During January 2008-March 2014, a total of 21 tetanus cases were reported; 5 (24 percent) were fatal (Table 1 [For Table, see original URL. - Mod.LL]). The patients were all adults ranging in age from 21 to 89 years (median = 52 years); 15 (71 percent) were male. An average of 3 cases were reported each year during 2008-2013 (range = 0-5). The average annual tetanus incidence rate during 2008-2013 was 0.09 cases per 1 million population, compared with 0.19 cases during 2002-2007. During 2008-2013, the average annual incidence among patients aged 65 years or higher (0.23 cases per 1 million population) was twice that among patients aged 21-64 years (0.10 cases per 1 million population). The case-fatality rate among patients aged 65 years or higher was 50 percent, compared with 13 percent among patients aged 21-64 years. Race and ethnicity were reported for 18 (86 percent) patients. The average annual incidence rates among Hispanics (0.08 cases per 1 million population), non-Hispanic whites (0.09), non-Hispanic blacks (0.07), and non-Hispanic Asians/Pacific Islanders (0.03) were similar.

All 21 tetanus patients were hospitalized; 19 (90 percent) were admitted to an intensive care unit, and 9 required mechanical ventilation. The median number of days hospitalized was 18 (range = 2-65); of 15 patients for whom data were available, the median cost of total hospital charges per patient was USD 166 259 (range = USD 22 229-1 024 672). Seven patients had conditions associated with increased risk for tetanus; 4 were diabetic, and 3 were injection-drug users (1). TT history was reported for 12 (57 percent) patients; 3 (25 percent) could not recall receiving any doses, and 9 (75 percent) recalled receiving one or more doses. Among the 9 patients who recalled receiving one or more doses, 6 received their last dose 10 to 50 years before their illness, and 3 could not recall when they received their last dose.

16 (76 percent) patients reported that an acute injury had occurred before illness onset; including punctures (7), abrasions (4), linear lacerations (3), compound fracture (1) and animal bite (1). Of 6 patients with data on wound depth, 2 had wounds that were more than 1 cm deep. Seven of 11 patients with available data had wounds that appeared infected, and 2 of 7 patients with available data had wounds with devitalized, ischemic, or denervated tissue. Five patients reported no acute injuries before onset; of these, 3 were injection-drug users. The remaining 2 patients could not recall any acute injuries; however, one reported an insect bite, and the other reported chronic abrasions on the hands and feet and exposure to soil.

Of the 16 patients who reported acute injuries before illness onset, 9 had sought medical care for their injuries (Table 2). Of the 9, only 2 received appropriate PEP before the onset of tetanus symptoms as recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) (Table 3) (2,3). Of the 7 patients who did not receive appropriate PEP, 5 had punctures or contaminated wounds and unknown TT vaccination histories, and should have received both TT and tetanus immune globulin (TIG) as recommended. However, 4 patients did not receive any PEP, and one received TT PEP only. Of the 2 remaining patients, one had a clean, minor wound and reported receiving at least one TT dose more than 10 years ago, but was not offered TT PEP as recommended; the other patient was contraindicated for TT because of a history of anaphylaxis but was not offered TIG as an alternative.

Following their tetanus diagnoses, all 21 patients were treated with TIG; 6 were treated one day or less after symptom onset, 8 4 days or less, 6 9 days or less, and one was treated more than 2 weeks after onset. Among the 5 fatal cases, one patient was treated one day or less after symptom onset, 2 were treated 4 days or less, and 2 9 days or less after onset. Of 15 patients for whom data on TIG dosage were available, 5 received less than the 3000-6000 U that is generally recommended for treatment (4); 2 received less than 500 U, and 3 received 500-1000 U.

Discussion
-------
Although rates of tetanus have declined, sporadic cases continue to occur, particularly in adults who are not up-to-date with TT. Vaccination coverage among children is higher; in 2012, an estimated 82.5 percent of U.S. children aged 19-35 months and 84.6 percent of U.S. children aged 13-17 years had received 4 or more doses of diphtheria toxoid-tetanus toxoid-acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) and one dose or more of tetanus, diphtheria, acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap), respectively (5,6). In contrast, only 62 percent of adults aged 19 years or more had received TT during the preceding 10 years; coverage for adults aged 65 years or more was 55 percent (7). All of the tetanus patients reported in California during January 2008-March 2014 were adults aged 21 years or higher. Among the 12 patients with verified vaccination histories, none recalled receiving TT during the preceding 10 years. Health care providers should assess patient vaccination status during routine visits to determine whether TT is needed. ACIP recommends that after receiving a primary childhood series, a tetanus and diphtheria vaccine (Td) dose should be given during adolescence and every 10 years thereafter. For added protection against pertussis, one of the Td booster doses should be Tdap if it was not previously administered (2,3).

Even minor wounds or abrasions can result in tetanus, highlighting the importance of ensuring that patients are up to date for TT (8,9). Providers should assess vaccination status in patients with wounds and in particular older adults, injection-drug users, patients with diabetes, and those with chronic wounds, all of whom are considered at increased risk for tetanus (1). Patients who have completed the 3-dose primary TT series need a booster dose as part of wound management if they have a clean, minor wound and received their last TT dose more than 10 years prior to injury, or if they have any other type of wound and received their last TT dose more than 5 years prior to injury (2). ACIP recommends that persons with unknown or incomplete histories receive TT as part of routine wound management; patients with wounds that are neither clean nor minor should receive TIG in addition to TT. Although the dosage of TIG for PEP is not specified in the recommendations, dosage information is provided in the product insert.

In this analysis, only 9 of 16 patients with acute injuries had sought medical care before their tetanus illness onset and diagnosis, and only 2 of the 9 received PEP with TT or TT plus TIG as recommended (2-4). Health care providers might fail to provide TIG PEP because of a lack of knowledge about current recommendations or because the assessment of wound severity and whether a patient should be managed with TIG according to ACIP recommendations can be subjective (2,10). All tetanus patients required considerable and costly medical care, including hospitalization, and almost all (90 percent) were admitted to intensive care. Among patients who received TIG as treatment, there was variability in the dose administered. In the USA, 3000-6000 U, given in a single intramuscular dose with part of the dose infiltrated around the wound if it can be identified, is generally recommended for treatment. However, the optimal therapeutic dose has not been established, and some experts contend that a dose of 500 U, as recommended by the World Health Organization, is as effective as higher doses and causes less discomfort (4). It is also possible that some providers treating tetanus patients inadvertently prescribed the PEP dosage of TIG rather than the treatment dosage. Among 5 treated patients who received less than 3000 U of TIG as treatment, 3 survived, and 2 died. Among 10 treated patients who received 3000 U or more of TIG, 7 survived, and 3 died.

The findings in this report are subject to at least 3 limitations. 1st, although California health care providers are required to report tetanus cases, surveillance is passive, and underreporting is likely. 2nd, because there is no laboratory testing for tetanus and case identification depends solely on clinical assessment, some cases might be misclassified. Finally, some of the case reports were incomplete, particularly with regard to TT history.

Although significant progress has been made in reducing the morbidity and mortality caused by tetanus, cases of this vaccine-preventable disease continue to be reported. Health care providers should assess the tetanus vaccination status of their patients during routine visits. All providers who provide care for patients with wounds should have protocols for tetanus PEP and ensure that appropriate PEP is provided for such patients.

[This report underscores the need for appropriate follow up immunization for another vaccine preventable disease, tetanus. ProMED has been active in reporting similar issues related to pertussis and measles in the developed world as well as the increase in poliomyelitis in parts of the developing world, all primarily related to under-vaccination.

It is noteworthy that as Editor-in-Chief of IDCases -- an open access infectious diseases case report journal -- I have seen 3 submissions regarding tetanus cases in an elderly population, primarily unimmunized, in the developed world, the UK and Norway. One has already been published (Collins S, White J, Ramsay M, Amirthalingam G: The importance of tetanus risk assessment during wound management. IDCases 2015; 2:3-5 http://ac.els-cdn.com/S2214250914000420/1-s2.0-S2214250914000420-main.pdf?_tid=ddc53b5e-cb20-11e4-926b-00000aacb35d&acdnat=1426430454_827959d608524cd92b22e7e085897fb8), and 2 are currently in the peer review process. Although the number of cases of tetanus in the developed world is not high, the case fatality rate in these cases is dramatically higher than for pertussis and measles. Routine boosters for tetanus during office visits or hospitalizations for any reason must be utilized to prevent these cases and trauma-related missed opportunities for tetanus protection cannot be tolerated. - Mod.LL
