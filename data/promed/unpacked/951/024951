[I have been getting ongoing queries about outbreaks related to
A/Iran 96 [see ProMED-mail posting above and contacted Peter Roeder,
FAO, for details. Attached to his reply was this appendix to the

Update on the FMD situation in Turkey and in Transcaucassian region
-----------------------------------------------------------------
In total, 12 outbreaks due to the new type A strain (A/Iran 96) have been
reported to OIE during the first 9 months of 1998. They occurred in 6
Provinces of Central Anatolia and in 3 Provinces of Western Anatolia. The
low number of type A FMD outbreaks reported in Turkey during the last 3
months (1 outbreak in July and no outbreaks in August and in September)
indicates that the virus did not continue to spread to the west as it was
initially feared. Thanks to the emergency vaccination with the homologous
vaccine, which was carried out in Thrace during the summer, the risk of FMD
spreading to Europe has been greatly reduced.
By contrast, the situation in the Transcaucasian area is of great concern.
The OIE Regional Reference Laboratory for FMD of Vladimir, Russia, has
reported that they have isolated a strain of type A very close to A/Iran 96
from FMD cases reported in cattle in the Amasiia district of Armenia.
Considering that the disease occurred in a transhumance area, the risk of
spreading the disease to Armenia and neighbouring countries is high. Urgent
measures are needed to control the disease in this region. The European
Commission for the Control of Foot-and-Mouth Disease and FAO are
investigating with other international organisations the emergency actions
that should be taken to prevent the extension of the disease in the region
and its introduction to Russia and to Europe.
