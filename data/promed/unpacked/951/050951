People are being reminded to check their vaccination history before
travelling overseas after an outbreak of measles on the New South
Wales [NSW] north coast. The state's Health Department says 5 people
have contracted the highly infectious illness after contact with a
traveller who brought the disease into the area. Two other travellers
have also contracted the disease in recent weeks.

The NSW Health director of communicable disease, Dr Jeremy McAnulty,
says people can easily spread the disease if they do not check their
vaccination history. "Measles is a nasty disease, and it's highly
preventable by vaccination," he said. "So the message is, make sure
you're vaccinated against measles; make sure your children are
vaccinated. But it's particularly important if you're about to travel
overseas; just double check that you're fully vaccinated against
measles. A lot of travellers haven't been vaccinated fully against
measles, and then when they come back, if they mix particularly with
people who also haven't been vaccinated, then that's what we're
starting to see on the North Coast."

[The 1st sign of measles is usually a high fever, which begins about
10 to 12 days after exposure to the virus and lasts 4-7 days. A runny
nose, a cough, red and watery eyes, and small white spots inside the
cheeks can develop in the initial stage. After several days, a rash
erupts, usually on the face and upper neck. Over about 3 days, the
rash spreads, eventually reaching the hands and feet. The rash lasts
for 5-6 days and then fades. On average, the rash occurs 14 days
after exposure to the virus (within a range of 7-18 days). This
highly contagious virus is spread by coughing and sneezing, close
personal contact or direct contact with infected nasal or throat secretions.

The virus remains active and contagious in the air or on surfaces for
up to 2 hours. It can be transmitted by an infected person from 4
days prior to the onset of the rash to 4 days after the rash erupts
(For more detailed information, see:
