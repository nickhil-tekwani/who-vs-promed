U.S. CDC reports finding single case of a new swine flu; no sustained spread
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another new swine flu virus has made the leap to humans, though U.S.
officials say it seems almost certain the virus hit a dead end. The
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported Friday [15
Jan 2010] that a child from Iowa became infected with a new swine flu
virus in September [2009], though the case didn't come to light until
November. The unnamed boy didn't need to be hospitalized, and he
recovered fully from the illness. Testing later showed he'd been
infected with a swine influenza virus of the H3N2 subtype,
*** different both from the pandemic H1N1 virus and from the seasonal
H3N2 viruses that have been circulating in people for decades.*** [see
ProMED archives listed below]. Human cases of infection with swine
influenza viruses happen from time to time. Often, though not always,
these infections are seen in people who work on pig farms or in
proximity to swine herds.

Last summer officials in Saskatchewan spotted a different swine H1N1
virus in 2 hog farm workers. As in the case of the boy in Iowa, that
virus seemed to stop spreading. "While these cases are rare, they're
not unheard of," Tom Skinner, a spokesman for the CDC, said from
Atlanta, Georgia. "We do detect them from time to time and it's
important for us to investigate, which happened in this case. And
luckily there wasn't any evidence of sustained person-to-person
transmission."

It isn't clear how the boy became infected with the virus. He had no
known contact with pigs, an eerie echo of the emergence last spring of
the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus. [Pandemic] H1N1 was 1st spotted in 2
children from California who had had no contact with pigs or with each
other. "It was a child, and yeah, very similar to the circumstances
that occurred last spring," Skinner said of the Iowa case. He said the
fact that the investigation turned up no other cases and that some
time has since elapsed suggests there isn't any ongoing spread. "I
think if there was other transmission going on associated with this
case we would have picked it up and we haven't."

There are a variety of influenza viruses circulating among pigs.
According to the CDC, the 4 main types currently found are H1N1, H1N2,
H3N1 and H3N2 viruses. Prior to the pandemic, a human case of swine
flu in the United States was discovered every year or 2. But in the 3
years or so before the [H1N1] pandemic, 12 cases were found.

[Transmission of swine influenza viruses to humans is an exceptional
event, and uniquely in the case of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009
swine-derived virus, it became easily transmissible from human to
human in an unrestricted manner. Additionally, swine have been
hypothesized to be intermediates in the process of adaptation of avian
influenza viruses for transmission to other mammals.

Fortunately in the case of the child in Iowa, onward transmission of
the swine H3N2 virus has not occurred. What is exceptional about this
case is that no evidence of contact of the child with swine has been
discovered, perhaps suggesting an additional intermediate host may
have been involved.
