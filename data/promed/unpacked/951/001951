At least 30 people from the Dutch Bible Belt have so far been diagnosed with measles in the 1st outbreak of the sometimes fatal disease in 13 years. The infections are largely based around strict Protestant schools in a broad sweep across the country from the Veluwe area to Zeeland province, the public health institute RIVM said in a statement. Fundamentalist Protestants in the Netherlands do not believe in having their children vaccinated.

The measles vaccine is given to most children in the BMR combination injection at the age of 14 months and again at 9 years. The total number of cases may be far higher than 30 because not everyone will have visited their doctor, the RIVM said. Measles is spread by coughing and sneezing. The RIVM [The National Institute for Public Health and the Environment] said it is monitoring developments closely and expects the spread of the disease to widen among unvaccinated children. Parents can visit their doctor for a catch-up injection, the RIVM said.

The last measles outbreak in the Netherlands was between 1999 and 2000 when there were some 3300 infections, and 3 children died.

There have been 14 cases of measles across the region since the start of the year and a total of 962 cases in England. This continues the trend seen since early 2012, with monthly totals around the highest recorded levels seen since 1994. There was one case in Medway in April 2013, and one in March 2013, compared with none at all in 2012.

The MMR catch-up programme, run by Public Health England, NHS England, the Department of Health, and local authorities, aims to prevent measles outbreaks by giving MMR to as many unvaccinated and partially vaccinated 10-16 year olds as possible in time for the next school year. Medway GP practices have been contacting the families of patients aged 10 to 16 who have missed out on the MMR jab.

New figures show there were 3 confirmed measles cases in Pendle in April 2013, as health officials continue a catch-up vaccination campaign for youngsters. There were 5 other cases in the rest of Lancashire and Cumbria in April 2013, but none of these were reported in East Lancashire. Since the start of the year [2013], there have been 73 confirmed cases across the region, though an outbreak in the Lancaster district accounted for 52 of those. A national catch-up programme is aiming to prevent measles outbreaks by giving MMR to as many unvaccinated and partially vaccinated 10-16 year olds as possible. This age group is most at risk of measles due to the fall in coverage of MMR that occurred in the late 1990s and early 2000s, when concern around the discredited link between autism and the vaccine was widespread.

Public Health Wales has warned that cases of mumps are now on the rise, after a month of increasing measles diagnoses. Up to the end of May 2013, there were 76 confirmed cases of mumps in Wales for the year so far; that compares with 77 cases for the whole of 2011 and 88 for the whole of 2012. The measles outbreak centred around Swansea has now seen 1191 cases despite more than 50 000 MMR vaccinations in the area, although the increase in cases has started to slow.

Measles has claimed the lives of 10 more children in Pakistan's Punjab province over the past 2 days, taking the toll in an outbreak of the disease to 148. Three to 5 children have been dying of measles every day since the outbreak in the province a month ago. According to a spokesman of the Health Department, the death toll in Lahore alone is 80.

Since Thursday [6 Jun 2013], 3 children succumbed to the disease in Lahore, 2 each in Faisalabad and Hafizabad districts, and one each in Toba Tek Singh, Mandi Bahauddin and Gujranwala. At least 195 more cases of measles were reported in Punjab, including 19 in Lahore on Friday [7 Jun 2013], the spokesman said. The failure to launch an immunisation campaign against measles and the failure to purchase the vaccine were said to be the main reasons for the outbreak.

After assuming charge, Punjab chief minister Shahbaz Sharif held a meeting on Friday [7 Jun 2013] to review the outbreak and approved an action plan to protect children against the disease and called for a vigorous campaign against the disease. "All out steps will be taken on an emergency basis to save children, and I will personally review the situation every week, while the Chief Secretary will hold a meeting everyday," Mr Sharif said. He directed officials to speed up the process of buying vaccines without waiting for support from international donors.

After Sindh and Punjab, the capital and its rural areas are under the threat of a measles epidemic. According to hospital sources, around 40 measles patients, almost all of them children, are brought to the Polyclinic Hospital and Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) of the federal capital everyday. The Polyclinic Hospital spokesman, Dr Sharif Astori, said that 15 to 20 measles-affected children were brought to the OPD [outpatients department] of the hospital and provided treatment, though no patient has been admitted. The doctor said that the disease had not become an epidemic so far. On the other hand, the PIMS Hospital spokesman, Dr Waseem Khawaja said that dozens of measles patients were brought to the OPD of the hospital daily and provided proper treatment. He said that a few children were admitted who were later discharged after recovery.

Punjab chief minister [CM] Shahbaz Sharif on Saturday [9 Jun 2013] said that an independent investigation had been ordered to inquire about dozens of infant deaths from measles in the province. The CM said this while addressing the convocation of College of Physicians and Surgeons in Lahore. He lauded the response of the [medical] community to the devastating floods of 2010 and the outbreak of dengue fever. Shahbaz said countries like Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Thailand were very impressed with the expertise of Pakistani doctors in dealing with the dengue fever outbreak and urged the doctors to keep up with the good work.

Meanwhile, measles on Saturday [9 Jun 2013] claimed 2 more lives, raising the number of deaths in the province to 146. According to health department officials, the deaths were reported one each from Children Hospital Lahore (an 8 month old), and from Allied Hospital, Faisalabad (a 24 month old). As many as 201 new cases of measles were reported from Punjab, including 40 from Lahore hospitals, increasing the total number of cases to 16 620 during the last 6 months.

Meanwhile, Health Services Punjab director general Dr Tanveer Ahmed said that during an investigation, it was found that a majority of deaths in Lahore were caused by severe pneumonia and delay in reaching hospitals. He urged the people to cooperate with the vaccinators and to contact doctors without any delay in case of symptoms of measles in their children.

The Lahore High Court on Tuesday [11 Jun 2013] said action will be taken against Punjab chief minister Shahbaz Sharif and others responsible if deaths caused by the measles outbreak in the province are not prevented, Express News reported. The court questioned director general (DG) Health Punjab Dr Tanvir Ahmed about measures taken to control the damage caused by the outbreak. The DG Health informed the court that children have been vaccinated, and this will help reduce the number of deaths considerably. Expressing dissatisfaction over the response from DG Health, the court asked Punjab CM and other health department officials to submit their reports over the issue to the court by the next hearing.

According to official reports, more than 1500 children are suffering from measles. As many as 129 children have died in the province so far. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the number of measles cases in Pakistan increased from 4000 in 2011 to 14 000 in 2012. As many as 306 children died of measles in the country last year [2012], most of them in flood-stricken areas.

On 12 Jun 2013, the National Health Surveillance reported a highly probable case of measles (IgM positive) in Buenos Aires. The patient is a 43 year old immunocompromised male recently arrived from Spain. He entered the country 2 months ago and developed fever and upper airway congestion on 1 Jun 2013 and was treated by a private physician. On 5 Jun 2013, he was admitted to a private hospital suffering from high fever, nasal discharge, and a skin rash. Initial examination excluded measles or rubella. Further examination and case control measures were initiated and diagnostic samples submitted to a reference laboratory [presumably providing the IgM-positive result].

During 2011, 1310 cases of measles were reported throughout the Americas and designated imported cases or import-related cases. Most importations originated from Europe with lesser numbers from elsewhere.

In 2012, the Region of the Americas has recorded outbreaks of imported and import-related cases of measles totalling 135 cases. About 90 per cent of these cases were reported by the United States and Ecuador, with 54 and 68 cases, respectively.

A person with measles may have infected others who visited BJ's Wholesale Club in Watchung on 3 Jun 2013, the state Department of Health announced today [13 Jun 2013]. The infected person was at the Route 22 store between 1:30 pm and 4 pm. People who were at the store at that time should contact their physician. The virus can be spread by the infected person sneezing, coughing, or even talking, according to the announcement.

Measles symptoms, which may not appear for weeks, include rash, high fever, cough, runny nose and red, watery eyes. "We urge everyone to check to make sure they and their family members are up-to-date on measles/mumps/rubella (MMR) vaccine and all other age-appropriate immunizations. Getting vaccinated not only protects you, it protects others around you who are too young to get the vaccine or can't receive it for medical reasons. Two doses of measles vaccine is more than 99 per cent effective in preventing measles," said Dr Christina Tan, state epidemiologist. "And if you're planning an international trip, the World Health Organization recommends that adults or adolescents unsure of their immune status get a dose of measles vaccine before traveling," she added.
