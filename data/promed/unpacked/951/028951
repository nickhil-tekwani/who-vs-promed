At least 2 foxes have died so far after being infected by the bird flu virus, the Belgian Nature and Forest Agency found after examining 25 fox carcasses. According to the agency, the animals became ill after eating sick or dead birds.

The bird flu virus is still raging on the coast. Further research should now show whether foxes also spread the virus among other mammals.

Anyone who sees sick or dead birds or foxes should report them on the influenza line for dead or sick birds, or contact the Ostend Bird and Wild Animal Rehabilitation Center for dead foxes.

[Infections by HPAI viruses in mammals are typically not common, but since April 2022 there have been several events of Eurasian HPAI H5N1 in wild carnivores (order Carnivora), most of them in the Americas. Most reports have been from red foxes (_Vulpes vulpes_, family Canidae), but skunks (family Mephitidae), raccoons (family Procyonidae), and seals (suborder Pinnipedia) have also been found infected.

The fact that there is also a large number of reports of HPAI H5N1 in birds of prey and scavengers suggests that predators/scavengers in general (both mammals and birds) are being highly exposed during this unprecedented HPAI epidemic. - Mod.PMB
