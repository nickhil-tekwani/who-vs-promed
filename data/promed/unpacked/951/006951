A total of 11 inhabitants of Megion were hospitalized with the acute
infectious disease known as pseudotuberculosis [yersiniosis -
Mod.LL]. Reservoirs of this infection are animals, birds, and
rodents. The disease occurs when people ingest contaminated food.
As Andreyan Borkhonoev, deputy chief of the territorial management of
Rospotrebnadzor (Federal Service for Surveillance of Consumer Rights
and Human Welfare - Assoc.Mod.NP) in Nizhnevartovsk and Megion
explained on 24 Apr 2007, the affected people lived in a hostel
without a refrigerator. They stored food on a floor. Thus, rodents
easily could infect foodstuffs.
Experts of the Rospotrebnadzor check shops and companies that deliver
food to the city's general educational establishments. Experts advise
to wash carefully vegetables and fruit with hot water.

[The manifestations of illness in these cases are not stated.
Infection with _Yersinia pseudotuberculosis_ is a zoonosis with
reservoirs in many animals, including rodents, rabbits, deer, and
various birds.
Most individuals affected are children or young adults. The most
common presentation of this infection is mesenteric lymphadenitis,
with fever and right lower quadrant abdominal pain, which can be
confused with acute appendicitis. A febrile gastroenteritis may also
occur, which has been described as Izumi syndrome in Japan. Late
complications may be a reactive arthritis or erythema nodosum.
Although many associations had been previously made, one of the
strongest studies of the relationship of _Y. pseudotuberculosis_ and
food was published in 2004 from Finland (1). The editorial commentary
(2) with the paper is a nicely presented discussion on the hazards of
infections associated with fresh produce. The diagnosis of infection
with this bacterium can be made by isolation of the organism from
lymph node or stool. Serological tests can be helpful, but
cross-reactions are found between yersiniae and other enteric
organisms, including some salmonellae.
