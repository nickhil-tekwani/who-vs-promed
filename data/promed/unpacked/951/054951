Europewide alert over Italian vegetables
----------------------------------------
A warning has gone to all Member States of the European Union after a
patient was treated for botulism at the Istituto Superiore Di Sanita,
Rome. Botulinum toxin was apparently detected in the product eaten by the
patient.
The [UK] Department of Health has been notified by the European Commission
of the contamination of vegetables packed in glass jars, and produced in
Italy.
There is no indication that the product has been imported into [the UK]. It
may, however, have been purchased abroad and brought home. The product is
marketed under two different names - either "Ribollita Toscana", or
"Minestrone Di Verdure". It is manufactured and packed by "Fattorie Toscana
Riunite SRL (Lucca)" at a factory in Bolgheri-Bibbona (Livorno), Italy. It
is contained in glass jars with a net weight of either 340g or 640g, and
has a 'best before' date of 31/12/2002.
The product is distributed within France and Germany, and is also exported
to Switzerland.
