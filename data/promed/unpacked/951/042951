More than 100 mine workers in the South Goa district have been
infected with chikungunya [virus], health minister Vishawajeet Rane
said in the state assembly Wednesday [29 Jul 2009].

Rane was speaking in response to a calling attention motion moved by
Sanguem legislator Vasudev Gaonkar, who claimed that a chikungunya
outbreak was spreading towards the town from the rural areas of
Quepem and Sanguem, around 60 km [37 mi] from [Panaji]. "The trend
that is evolving is that mining workers are affected by chikungunya
[virus infection]. More than 100 blood samples have been drawn and
have been diagnosed as chikungunya. The outbreak is similar to the
one which occurred in Candolim last year [2008]," Rane said, adding
that the disease first made its appearance in the mining belt of
Quepem and Sanguem in January this year [2009].

"The directorate of health services is monitoring the situation.
Additional staff has also been deployed and health surveys in the
areas have been completed. The patients affected have been
identified," Rane said.

Chikungunya is a virus which is transmitted to humans by
virus-carrying _Aedes_ mosquitoes.
