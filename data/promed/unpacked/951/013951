23 bison carcasses have been found near Fort Providence, N.W.T., making a total of 151 bison that are suspected to have died from an anthrax outbreak. Five of the 23 latest carcasses were found near the Deh Cho bridge construction site.

An incident command team from the territory's Department of Environment and Natural Resources is disposing of the carcasses by spraying them with formaldehyde and burning them.

The department sent samples from the carcasses to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency to determine the exact cause of death. Judy McLinton, the department's spokeswoman, said the test results should be available next week.

During a routine anthrax surveillance last week, 128 carcasses of the large animals were found near Mills Lake, which is about 30 km northeast of the community. In response to the find, the department issued an anthrax emergency response plan to deal with the potential outbreak last week. It sent samples from the dead animals to a Canadian Food Inspection Agency lab in Lethbridge, Alta., to determine the exact cause of death.

The public is advised not to approach or touch the carcasses. Anyone who comes across dead bison is asked to notify the Department of Environment and Natural Resources.

[Earlier, we were told [see 20120710.1196294] that 11 carcasses had been located near Hwy 3 at Caen Lake, which is 51 km NNE of the Mackenzie river. The Deh Cho bridge is 11 km SE of Fort Providence, with 5 carcasses, and a number, "10 and counting," at the ferry crossing, which is 7.5 km SE of the new bridge. From this, it is clear that the epidemic is clearly not restricted to the Mills Lake area and is extensive; subscribers are encouraged to visit Google Earth to get an idea of the area of concern.

Also, these additional deaths are of animals seen from a vehicle; they are essentially roadside. With more flights, I suspect more dead bison will be found on meadows deep in the woodlands. - Mod.MHJ
