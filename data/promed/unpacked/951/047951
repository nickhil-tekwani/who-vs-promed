Fear of anthrax cow disease spreading from Bosnia to Croatia
------------------------------------------------------------
Bosnian authorities confirmed that several cows in Livno area (Bosnia
and Herzegovina) have died from anthrax, prompting fears that the
contagious illness [sic - MHJ] could spread to neighbouring Croatia.
The total of 9 samples analysed showed that 6 of the dead cows had
been infected. So far, 14 deaths have been reported, and while the
situation is alarming, no epidemic warning has been issued.

The authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina have sent an appeal to all
cattle owners in Livno and neighboring villages to keep their animals
from grazing as the source of disease was located in the fields. They
are worried that some owners may try to hide the infected cattle and
bury them in fields against the normal protocol.

The experts say that the disease could spread easily to neighbouring
Croatia due to the closeness of the border.

The authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia are expected to
collaborate and develop preventative measures that would contain the
potential spread of the disease, the daily Vecernji List writes.

[The normal and recommended procedure is to promptly move the
livestock out of the field where the index case(s) occurred and
vaccinate them. And preferably to burn the carcass(es) in situ.
Otherwise, bury them.

Anthrax is not contagious. It appears so because of the infection
being spread by haemophagic flies (tabanids or horse flies) because as
the female flies feed they carry the infection from animal to animal
on their contaminated mouthparts. Because of the numbers of cattle
already reported as dead, the risk of fly borne infarction is
significant. Therefore the neighbouring herds, including across the
border in Croatia, should be vaccinated as quickly as possible to
protect them.

Anthrax is truly sporadic in Bosnia. In 2001 there was an outbreak in
Bileca, where it had not been seen in 30 years. In 2002 there were 3
outbreaks, 2003 (1); 2004, none reported; 2005 (2); 2006-2007 (0);
2008 (2); and 2009 (0). There is the occasional human case. - Mod.MHJ]
