Sequiviruses are isometric aphidborne plant viruses.
Dandelion yellow mosaic virus (DaYMV), genus _Sequivirus_,
was isolated from dandelion and lettuce in Europe. Lettuce
mottle virus (LeMoV), a putative sequivirus, is often found
in mixed infections with Lettuce mosaic virus (LMV) in
Brazil (3). DaYMV, LeMoV and LMV cause similar mosaics in
field-grown lettuce. Differences in biology and sequence
suggest that DaYMV and LeMoV are distinct species (2).
42 and 101 lettuce samples with mosaic symptoms collected
from 2 locations near Santiago during a survey of lettuce
viruses in Chile in 2002 and 2003, respectively, were
analyzed for the presence of LeMoV using reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Total RNA
was extracted (1) and used for RT-PCR with the specific
LeMoV primers pairs Lmo3 (5' ACATGAGCACTAGTGAGG 3') and Lmo4
(5' AGATAGAGCCGTCTGGCG 3') (2).
One of the 42 and 3 of the 101 samples produced the expected
300-bp fragment. Isometric particles of 30 nm diameter,
typical of a sequivirus, were visualized by transmission
electron microscopy. These samples were tested using RT-PCR
for the presence of LMV and Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), but
no mixed infections were observed. One isolate, Ch36, was
reamplified with the degenerate primer pairs DALE 1 (5'
GARTTCAACATGCACGCCAG 3') and DALE 2 (5'TTTTTCTCCCCATYCGTCAT
3') which amplify part of the putative replicase gene (2)
and produced a 563-bp fragment that was cloned on pGEM-T
Easy (Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced. The Ch36 product
(EMBL Accession No. AM039965) showed 97 per cent amino acid
identity with LeMoV from Brazil, 79 per cent with DaYMV, 72
per cent with the sequivirus Parsnip yellow fleck virus, and
34 per cent with the waikavirus Maize chlorotic dwarf virus.
To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of a sequivirus in
field lettuce in Chile, and although the virus was found at
low incidence, this report extends the range of LeMoV to the
western side of the Cordillera de Los Andes.
The impact of LeMoV needs to be further analyzed in Chile,
Brazil, and possibly other South American countries.

[Plants of lettuce (_Lactuca sativa_) cv 'Veronica' showing
mottle symptoms were submitted to biological, serological
and physicochemical tests as well as electron microscopy to
determine a possible association of a virus matching the
expressed symptomatology. Mechanical inoculation of sap
extracts resulted in local lesions on _Chenopodium quinoa_
and isometric virus particles were observed. The host range
was restricted to a few species of _Asteraceae_,
_Chenopodiaceae_ and _Solanaceae_, and most commercial
lettuce cultivars developed mottle symptoms when
mechanically inoculated with the virus. _Helichrysum
bracteatum_ (strawflower), a spontaneous _Asteraceae_, was
found to be a potential differential host since it is
susceptible to the virus and not to Lettuce mosaic virus
(genus _Potyvirus_). A serological relationship with
Dandelion yellow mosaic virus (genus _Sequivirus_) was
demonstrated by plate-trapped antigen-enzyme linked
immunosorbent assays (PTA-ELISA).
The fact that LeMoV has spread to the western side of the
Cordillera de Los Andes is of significance to growers in
that region, as is the finding that this is the 1st report
of a sequivirus infecting field lettuce in Chile.
