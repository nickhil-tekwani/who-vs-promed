Notes:
Cumulative number of cases includes number of deaths.
As SARS is a diagnosis of exclusion, the status of a reported case
may change over time. This means that previously reported cases may
be discarded after further investigation and follow-up.
1. Due to differences in the case definitions being used at a
national level, probable cases are reported by all countries except
the United States of America, which is reporting suspected cases
under investigation.
2. Includes cases who are "discharged" or "recovered" as reported by
the national public health authorities.
3. National public health authorities report to WHO on the areas in
which local chain(s) of transmission is/are occurring. These areas
are provided on the list of (See Affected Areas ).
4. One death attributed to Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of
China occurred in a case medically transferred from Viet Nam.

[C] Update 33 - Update on Hong Kong and China, first SARS case
reported in India 18 Apr 2003
<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_04_18/en/>
Hong Kong: investigation of Amoy Gardens cluster
The Hong Kong Secretary for Environment, Transport and Works, in
collaboration with 8 other government agencies, has released the
results of an extensive investigation of an unusual cluster of SARS
cases concentrated in the Amoy Gardens housing estate.
The investigation, which drew on epidemiological, environmental, and
laboratory studies, has identified sewage contaminated with the SARS
virus as the probable point source of exposure. Epidemiological
investigation has focused on the role of a 33-year-old man who
developed symptoms of SARS on 14 Mar 2003 and visited a relative in
Block E, Amoy Gardens on 14 and 19 Mar 2003. His symptoms at that
time included diarrhea.
Based on the epidemiology of the outbreak, officials believe that
this patient, who is linked to the infection of 2 relatives and 2
nurses, was the source of the outbreak. Subsequent rapid spread to
other residents (321 cases of as 15 Apr 2003) is thought to have
involved defective U-traps in bathrooms, an amplifying effect of
bathroom exhaust fans, a cracked sewer vent pipe serving Block E, and
an aerodynamic effect in a lightwell to which bathroom windows opened.
Laboratory investigations confirmed the presence of the SARS virus in
a swab from the toilet bowl in the bathroom of a SARS patient, but
not in numerous other environmental samples.
"This is a plausible hypothesis," says David Heymann, Executive
Director of communicable diseases at WHO. "This is the kind of study
that is needed to find what it is in the environment that is
transmitting this disease." Further work will be needed to reach
firm conclusions about the source of the outbreak and the unusual way
in which infection has spread.
The study found no epidemiological or laboratory evidence that the
SARS virus was transmitted by air, water, or infected dust aerosols.
"It is reassuring that speculations about a possible airborne
transmission have not been borne out by the evidence available to
date," says Heymann. The transmission of SARS within the Amoy
Gardens estate is the first known instance involving a possible
environmental spread of the virus. Thorough multi-disciplinary
investigation of this unusual outbreak, as is now under way, is fully
warranted. Once the outbreak is fully understood, the next important
step will be to develop measures that can prevent other instances of
environmental spread occurring under similar circumstances.
China advises officials on SARS
China's top leaders cautioned officials this morning not to cover up
the spread of SARS. Yesterday, during an urgent meeting of China's
highest ruling body, presided over by President Hu Jintao, Beijing
explicitly warned against the covering up of SARS cases and demanded
the "accurate, timely, and honest reporting of the SARS situation,"
according to Xinhua, the country's official news agency. China's
leaders called SARS a serious threat to the nation's reform,
development and stability, adding that party and government leaders
would be held accountable for the situations in their respective
jurisdictions.
Earlier this week, the WHO Beijing team estimated that Beijing may
have as many as 200 cases of SARS, rather than the 37 officially
reported. The team recommended that Beijing improve its reporting
system, possibly using as a model procedures followed in Guangdong
Province, where the daily SARS reports are considered reliable and
transparent. WHO experts also recommended that Beijing revise its
definition of what constitutes a "suspect" SARS case.
At present, many patients reported by Beijing as "suspect" would be
classified as "probable" according to the case definition set out by
WHO and used in official notifications of cases to WHO. As WHO
reports only probable cases in its daily cumulative totals, such a
change on the part of Beijing would result in a large increase in the
number of cases notified to WHO.
First SARS case reported in India
India reported its first case of SARS yesterday. The National
Institute of Virology in the western coastal state of Goa confirmed
the presence of the new coronavirus which causes SARS, in samples
from the patient. He is said to have recovered and is still being
kept in isolation after visiting Singapore, Hong Kong, and briefly
stopping over in Mumbai.
There have been fears that if the SARS virus reached India, it could
spread rapidly in the subcontinent's crowded cities and health
facilities. WHO officials believe it is good news that the one case
has been detected and reported, as this indicates that the
surveillance system is on high alert and working well. As has been
demonstrated in many countries, prompt detection of new cases, proper
management, and efficient contact tracing can prevent isolated cases
from infecting others.
Update on cases and countries
As of today, a cumulative total of 3461 cases with 170 deaths have
been reported from 25 countries on 5 continents. This represents an
increase of 72 new cases and 5 deaths since the last WHO update. The
deaths occurred in Hong Kong SAR (4) and Singapore (1).

[In addition to today's cumulative statistics on worldwide cases and
deaths as stated at the end of this piece, there have been 72 new
cases and 5 deaths reported to WHO in the past 24 hours. The results
of the environmental studies conducted at the Amoy Gardens block of
flats is very interesting, as the identification of coronavirus in
sewage, combined with the defective U-traps, an amplifying effect of
exhaust fans, a cracked sewer vent pipe, and an aerodynamic effect in
a lightwell is hypothesized to have resulted 321 cases in a very
short period of time. As mentioned by Dr. Heymann, this is a
plausible theory, but more studies are necessary before arriving at
additional recommendations for interruption of disease transmission.
