Occurrence of charcoal rot caused by _Macrophomina phaseolina_ on canola in
Argentina
---------------------------------------------------

Canola (_Brassica napus_) is an important oleaginous crop in Argentina.
About 16 000 ha are grown commercially in the southern region of Buenos
Aires Province. In 2003, typical symptoms and signs of charcoal rot were
observed on canola plants in experimental plots located at the School of
Agricultural Sciences, University of Buenos Aires in Buenos Aires. Average
disease incidence across 3 plants 5-6 months old (cvs. Monty, Rivette, and
Trooper) was 12 per cent (range 7-17 per cent). Affected plants appeared in
patches following the rows at pod-filling stage. Symptoms included wilted
foliage, premature senescence, and death of plants. Black, spherical
microsclerotia 78-95 micrometres in diameter were present in vascular
tissue of basal stems and taproots. The affected plants were stunted and
had unfilled pods. In advanced phases of the disease, areas of silver
gray-to-black discoloration were observed in the stem cortex; many plants
were killed during late-grain fill, and plants could be pulled easily from
the ground because basal stems were shredded. Four samples consisting of 5
symptomatic plants per sample were randomly collected from experimental
plots. Pieces (1 cm long) taken from taproots and basal stems of diseased
plants were surface sterilized with 1 per cent NaOCl for 2 min and then
placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA). Plates were incubated in the dark at
26 deg C for 4 days and then exposed to 12-h NUV light/12-h dark for 6
days. Five resulting isolates were identified as _Macrophomina phaseolina_
(Tassi) Goidanich (1) based on the gray color of the colony and the
presence of microsclerotia 71 to 94 micrometers in diameter. Two colonies
developed globose pycnidia with one-celled, hyaline, and elliptic conidia.
Pathogenicity tests were conducted using 4 inoculated and 3 noninoculated
control plants potted in a sterilized soil mix (soil/sand, 3:1) in a
greenhouse at 25 deg C and 75 percent relative humidity with no
supplemental light. Crown inoculations were carried out by placing a disk
taken from an actively growing culture of _M. phaseolina_ into wounds made
with a sterile scalpel. Control plants received disks of sterile PDA.
Inoculated and control plants were covered with polyethylene bags for 48 h
after inoculation. Three isolates caused disease on 7-week-old canola
plants (cvs. Master, Mistral, Rivette, and Trooper). Characteristic
symptoms similar to the original observations developed for all 3 isolates
within 21 days after inoculation on 80 per cent of inoculated plants. The
pathogen was successfully reisolated from diseased stem tissue in all
instances. Symptoms included leaf necrosis, stunting, decay and collapse of
seedlings, and plant death. Control plants remained asymptomatic. The
experiment was repeated once with similar results. To our knowledge, this
is the first report of the occurrence of _M. phaseolina_ causing charcoal
rot on canola in Argentina. This pathogen has been previously reported in
the United States (2,3). The results demonstrate the potential importance
of this pathogen in Argentina, since 2 commercial cultivars (Master and
Mistral) were apparently susceptible to _M. phaseolina_. More studies are
needed to determine the presence of charcoal rot in canola-growing areas of
Argentina.

[The oil-crop plant canola, _Brassica napus_, is an alternative crop to
wheat in Argentina. It develops symptoms of the disease charcoal rot when
infected by the fungus _Macrophomina phaseolina_ (Mp), which is a highly
variable fungus, with isolates differing in microsclerotial size and the
ability to produce pycnidia. The pathogen also infects and causes diseases
of corn/maize, soybeans, and sunflower. It is a weak pathogen killing
plants that are stressed, especially by high temperatures. It is an
important pathogen in southern USA, Mexico, and Africa. Sclerotia survive
in soil, thus providing inoculum for future infections of the crop. Crop
rotation, use of early maturing varieties to avoid late season heat/drought
stress, and water management are methods used to manage the disease.
