Nearly half of Taiwan's imported seafood is contaminated with poisonous
_Vibrio parahaemolyticus_, which can easily cause dysentery, the Department
of Health (DOH) reported on Wednesday.
The DOH's National Quarantine Service checked 686 items of fresh seafood
brought into Taiwan through Kaohsiung's international airport between July
1997 and April 1998, and found that 46 percent were contaminated with _V.
parahaemolyticus_. The quarantine officials found _V. parahaemolyticus_ in
49 percent of imported fresh shellfish and in 37 percent in non-shellfish
seafood, according to a National Quarantine Service report released Wednesday.
According to the quarantine authorities, no _V. parahaemolyticus_ epidemic
has been declared or reported in Taiwan, which makes it hard for the
government to crack down on the import of foods known to be contaminated
with the virus [bacterium, not virus - Mod.CYC].
Officials said the only way to guard against being affected by the virus
[bacterium] is to ensure that seafood is properly stored in a cool area and
that cooked food is separated from raw food. [I would also include avoid
eating raw or partially cooked shellfish - Mod.CYC].
Live prawns, sea crabs, lobsters and other shellfish make up the bulk of
Taiwan's imported fresh seafood, the officials said.
