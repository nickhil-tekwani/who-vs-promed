Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 21 Feb 2017
Date of confirmation of the event: 17 Jul 2017
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence of a listed disease
Manifestation of disease: Sub-clinical infection
Causal agent: _Theileria equi_ and _Babesia caballi_
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (basic)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks: 1
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Akhal, Ashkhabad [Ashgabat]
Date of start of the outbreak: 21 Feb 2017
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: village
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Equidae / 2631 / 171 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: samples taken and frozen [on 21 Feb 2017]. Because reagents for testing were absent, testing of those frozen samples was carried out [on 17 Jul 2017]. 21 donkeys were tested for piroplasmosis, 17 of them were positive for _Theileria equi_, 55 horses were tested, 15 of them were positive for _ Babesia caballi_, all 55 of them positive for _Theileria equi_. [On 6 Jun 2017] next sampling was carried out. These samples were also tested on [17 Jul 2017]. 1 of 85 samples of donkeys was tested positive for _Babesia caballi_, and 15 samples were positive for _Theileria equi_. 9 out of 58 samples of horses were positive for _Babesia caballi_, and all 58 samples were positive for _Theileria equi_.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Equidae / 6.5 / 0 / 0 / 0
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: legal movement of animals, contact with wild species.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country, surveillance within containment and/or protection zone, screening, traceability, disinfection, disinfestation, vector surveillance, vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists), treatment of affected animals (Azidin 7 percent)
Measures to be applied: surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Central Veterinary Laboratory (national laboratory) / Equidae / antibody detection ELISA/ 17 Jul 2017 / Positive

Future reporting

["Equine piroplasmosis is a tick-borne protozoal infection of horses. Piroplasmosis may be difficult to diagnose, as it can cause variable and nonspecific clinical signs. The symptoms of this disease range from acute fever, inappetence and malaise, to anemia and jaundice, sudden death, or chronic weight loss and poor exercise tolerance. Piroplasmosis is a major constraint to the international movement of equines.

Equine piroplasmosis results from infection by the protozoa _Babesia caballi_ or _Theileria equi_ (formerly _Babesia equi_). They can infect an animal concurrently.

Equine piroplasmosis affects horses, mules, donkeys and zebras. Zebras are an important reservoir for infection in Africa.

Some species of _Babesia_ or _Theileria_ can occasionally infect species other than their usual host, including humans. To date, the most important pathogens for humans appear to be the bovine pathogen _B. divergens_ in Europe and the rodent species _B. microti_ in the US.

Although _B. caballi_ or _T. equi_ may have been implicated in a few human infections in the past, these organisms do not seem to be important zoonoses. However, human babesiosis is still incompletely understood, and the possibility of infection with these organisms has not been ruled out."
