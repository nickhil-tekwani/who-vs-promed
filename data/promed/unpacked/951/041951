"Is there any person here who [knows someone who] has died of leprosy?" This was the question posed by Hilarion Guia to international and Philippine government health officials and specialists at the 2nd International Leprosy Stakeholders Symposium in Manila. The answer to Guia's question might as well be "no" since deaths from leprosy are very rare.

Guia was diagnosed with leprosy as a young boy. He is already cured from the disease but the deformities and missing fingers in his hand bear the scars of a painful past. He was treated in the "land of the living dead" in Culion, Palawan, which was known as the country's "leper colony."

But now, things have changed. Culion is becoming a tourist area especially for beach lovers. In fact, Guia was the 1st mayor of Culion and is currently the president of the Coalition of Leprosy Advocates in the Philippines. "Culion Island is leprosy-free. Leprosy has been totally controlled," claimed Guia.

But leprosy still exists in the Philippines. World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for the Western Pacific's coordinator for Stop TB [tuberculosis] and Leprosy Elimination, Dr Nobuyuki Nishikiori, reported that there were 1655 new cases of leprosy in the country in 2014. This was the highest in the Western Pacific Region. China came 2nd with 823, and 3rd was Papua New Guinea with 540 new cases in 2014.

Dr Ernesto Villalon head of the National Leprosy Program of the Department of Health (DOH) said that most of the leprosy cases were reported to come from Region 7 or Central Visayas, which covers Cebu, Bohol, Negros, and Bicol. Dr Villalon said that majority of the cases came from Cebu, which has the biggest leprosy and TB facility but it doesn't mean they are from Cebu. "Some of them come to Cebu and they do not say where they originally come from for fear of discrimination," he said.

Health Undersecretary Vicente Belizario called for identifying the remaining "pockets" or "barangays" with reported leprosy cases and to look for solutions not just highlight the challenges. Dr Villalon said that they are now in the process of collating data and will soon be able to identify the remaining small units.

"Leprosy is something we should push forward harder now. We should move forward from disease control and prevention towards elimination," said Belizario. But Dr Nishikiori stressed that there is a tendency to sometimes confuse "elimination with sustainability. We tend to focus on elimination, [and] we might eliminate the programs and services. Elimination is the result. What is also important is sustainable services," said Nishikiori.

Leprosy is curable and treatment is free in the Philippines. The multi-drug therapy (MDT) to treat leprosy is given for free in government hospitals.

[The Philippines, with an estimated population of over 100 million residents in 2015, is an archipelago of 7107 islands that are divided into 3 island groups: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao, which are further divided into the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), 17 regions, and 81 provinces (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines; https://shairasaloma005.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/aaa.png.

Culion, an island in the Palawan province of the Philippines, was established at the beginning of the 20th century by the US government in order to rid leprosy from the Philippine islands through isolating all existing cases (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culion_leper_colony).

The Philippines is in the Western Pacific Region, one of the 6 regions of WHO (regional map at http://hiip.wpro.who.int/portal/portals/0/CountryProfiles/Western_Pacific_Region.png). The Western Pacific Region is home to about 1.6 billion people, nearly 1/3 of the world's population. This region includes 37 countries and areas, from China and Mongolia in the north and west, to New Zealand and Australia in the south, to Japan and Korea in the north east, and to French Polynesia in the south east (http://www.wpro.who.int/countries/en/). Also included are Brunei, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, Singapore; and Viet Nam, plus multiple smaller Pacific island countries, in addition to the Philippines (http://www.wpro.who.int/countries/en/).

The National Leprosy Control Program in the Philippines was established in 1986 and leprosy has been eliminated in the Philippines as a public health problem at the national level (that is, a prevalence of less than 1 case per 10 000 population) in 1998, although there are pockets of cases around the country. In 1986, the leprosy prevalence rate was 7.2 per 10 000 population and in 2010, the prevalence rate was down to 0.31 due to the nationwide implementation of multidrug therapy and other tactics (http://www.wpro.who.int/philippines/areas/communicable_diseases/leprosy/who_leprosy_control_burden_.pdf).

However, the Philippines had more new cases reported than any of the other countries in the Western Pacific region and the number of new cases in the Philippines comprised 40.4 percent of that of the Western Pacific Region in 2010 (http://www.wpro.who.int/philippines/areas/communicable_diseases/leprosy/who_leprosy_control_burden_.pdf), but the incidence rate (the number of cases per 100 000 population) are 50 to 100-fold higher in Micronesia, Kiribati, and the Marshall Islands.

The percent of new cases detected in the Philippines that are multibacillary, the contagious form of the disease, was high at 94 percent, indicating a high potential for transmission and risk for complications that can increase the disabilities; but the percent of new cases detected in children below 15 years old remained low at 4.6 percent, indicating low ongoing transmission. - Mod.ML
