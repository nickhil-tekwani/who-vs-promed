In the first three weeks of [Jan 1999], the rates of influenza-like illness
per 1,000 consultations reported by General Out-patient Clinics ranged from
4.2 cases for the week ending 2 Jan; 5.5 cases for the week ending 9 Jan;
and 7.7 cases for the week ending 16 Jan. The preliminary figure for the
week ending 23 Jan is 11.8 cases.
The same rising trend is also noted in the sentinel centres made up of
general practitioners. The rates of influenza-like illness per 1,000
consultations reported by general practitioners are 45.5 cases for the week
ending 2 Jan; 56 cases for the week ending 9 Jan; and 62.2 cases for the
week ending 16 Jan. The preliminary figure for the week ending 23 Jan is
102.8 cases.
February and March is the usual peak season for influenza in Hong Kong each
year. Increased traffic with other countries during the long Chinese New
Year holiday could make Hong Kong more susceptible to the spread of
influenza.
The [Department of Health's] surveillance programme on influenza-like
illness also shows that so far the predominant strain affecting Hong Kong
is the influenza A H3N2 Sydney-like strain.

At least 24 people nationwide have died of influenza-related diseases this
month, according to a survey conducted by Kyodo News.
Of the 24, 20 were elderly people who died of pneumonia or bronchitis at
welfare facilities, including nursing homes in Iwate, Miyagi, Niigata,
Gunma and Saitama prefectures, according to the survey released Wednesday.
The survey found that 11 people, the largest number of flu victims, died in
Miyagi Prefecture.
Comments from the reporter: The Japanese National Infectious Disease
Surveillance Center recently posted a flu surveillance page on their web

Doctors in Singapore reported a 20-50 per cent increase in the number of
influenza cases, with patients taking longer to recover.
Eight out of 10 doctors contacted [by their correspondent] confirmed they
were seeing more patients, with some noting that patients took a longer
time [10-14 days] to recover. Most said the increase started two weeks ago.
A doctor with 13 years' experience said she used to see about 50 patients a
day, about half of whom had the flu; she now sees about 100 patients a day,
and 4 out of 5 have the flu.

The Singapore Ministry of Health has issued a press release on the
influenza situation in Singapore. The relevant portion is excerpted below:
"The Ministry of Health has noted an increase in the number of patients
attending government polyclinics with symptoms of high fever, sore throat,
cough and running nose, associated with headache and general muscle aches,
suggestive of an upper respiratory tract infection or influenza.
During the first 3 weeks of this year, the average weekly [patient visits]
with ?flu-like symptoms showed a 14% increase compared to the average
weekly [patient visits] in 1998. Laboratory surveillance has also shown an
increase in the number of positive tests for influenza. The number of cases
tested positive for the influenza virus has also increased five-fold during
this period, compared with the same period last year.
The influenza A virus was responsible for the majority of cases tested
positive so far. The viruses isolated from influenza cases have
corresponded to the circulating viruses reported by the World Health
Organization. No new or unusual viruses have been isolated in Singapore so
far."

[According to the WHO Weekly Epidemiological Record of 2 October 1998, the
influenza A viruses which circulated between March and September of 1998
were predominantly of the A(H3N2) subtype; in many countries influenza
A(H1N1) viruses were also isolated. Singapore also reported the isolations
of these two influenza A subtypes - Mod.CYC]
