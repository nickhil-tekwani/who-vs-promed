New Human Case of Avian Influenza Confirmed in Sivas Province
-------------------------------------------------------------
Turkey has confirmed a new case of avian influenza in a patient in
the central province of Sivas, the CNN Turk television channel
reported on Tuesday [10 Jan 2006]. The Turkish authorities said on
Monday [9 Jan 2006] that 14 people had been confirmed with bird
flu infections so far. Of these, 3 children died in rural eastern
Turkey last week -- the first deaths from bird flu on the fringes of
Europe. The new case of bird flu in Turkey is one of 8 patients being
tested in Sivas.
Turkey is testing dozens more people elsewhere. The U.N. World Health
Organisation said the victims appeared to have caught the H5N1 bird
flu virus directly from infected birds, as has been happening in
southeast Asia, and not from other people.

More Than 70 Suspected Human Cases Undergoing Tests
----------------------------------------------------
Turkey reported another case of bird flu in a patient in the centre
of the country on Tuesday as the authorities sealed off parts of the
outskirts of major cities Ankara and Istanbul while they culled
poultry. 3 children have already died in eastern Turkey --- the first
reported deaths from avian influenza outside China and Southeast
Asia. Dozens of worried Turks have rushed to hospitals for tests for
the virus across the country of 72 million.
4 people were taken to hospital with suspected avian influenza in the
town of Aydin near the Aegean coast --- one of Turkey's most
important tourism centres --- fuelling fears the outbreak will harm
country's important tourist trade. Turkey has now confirmed 15
people with avian influenza infections since last week, most in
eastern, central and northern parts of the country. More than 70
people are suspected of having the bird flu virus and are undergoing
tests. Health experts say the outbreak in Turkey is the worst since
the outbreak in Hong Kong in 1997 when 18 people were infected and 6
died before it was brought under control. H5N1 avian influenza has
killed at least 76 people since it reemerged in late 2003.
Nancy Cox, an influenza expert at the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, said it was not clear why there should be
such a cluster of cases in Turkey. "We know that there is a
seasonality to influenza in birds and just as there a seasonality in
humans where the viruses circulate in the wintertime in the cooler
temperatures," said Cox. "We don't precisely know what the factors
are. It could be it has just taken some time for the virus to spread
within the poultry population in Turkey and for enough humans to be
in contact with sick and dying birds to be infected."
The latest victim confirmed with bird flu was from the central
province of Sivas, Anatolian news agency said on Tuesday. Parts of
the capital Ankara and the business hub Istanbul have been sealed
off for the culling of poultry. Inhabitants leaving the areas have
been disinfected.
The Turkish authorities said 12 of 23 people undergoing tests for
avian influenza in Istanbul had tested negative. There is concern the
deadly virus could hit a teeming city of 12 million which is the
country's commercial hub and gateway to Europe from Asia. Human cases
of the disease have been reported as far west as the Ankara area,
some 400 km (250 miles) from Istanbul.
Authorities have stepped up an information campaign on how to deal
with birds and called on locals to comply with culling regulations,
particularly in the poor mainly-Kurdish southeast. Critics say the
authorities are not being tough enough. Local authorities say the
best way to stop avian influenza is the wholesale culling of poultry
in in the affected areas, but they have struggled to convince
inhabitants in poor rural areas who make a living on raising their
animals at home. Authorities urged Turks to wash the hooves of cattle
and sheep who are often in close contact with poultry. Turkey is
celebrating the Muslim Eid al-Adha festival in which many people
sacrifice a sheep or sometimes cows.
Health Minister Recep Akdag said villages raising chickens for
killing or for their eggs was already a thing of the past. "Keeping
poultry at home and in coops must absolutely end," the Hurriyet
daily quoted Akdag as saying.

None of Latest Human Cases in life-threatening Condition
--------------------------------------------------------
Turkish officials said on Tuesday [10 Jan 2006] that none of the
latest human victims of bird flu were in a life-threatening condition
and international experts said the outbreak could be controlled. Two
teenagers died last week from bird flu in eastern Turkey -- the first
reported deaths from the virus outside China and Southeast Asia.
Their dead sister is also a suspected victim and dozens of Turks have
rushed to hospitals for bird flu tests.
Speaking by telephone from Ankara, the leader of a World Health
Organisation (WHO) team sent to investigate, Guenael Rodier, said: "I
have a sense that what is going on in Turkey can be brought under
control relatively easily." Another senior WHO official also told the
same news conference that genetic testing on virus samples taken
from both human cases and animals showed them to be very similar,
pointing to poultry being the source.
The rash of cases in Turkey is the first time the virus has been
detected in people outside east Asia since it reemerged in late 2003.
It is known to have killed at least 76 people in that time. Turkey
reported another human case of bird flu on Tuesday in the central
province of Sivas, but said none of the people infected with the
virus were in a critical condition.
"So far H5N1 has been detected in 15 cases and 2 of them have died.
We don't see any new cases in the east, the focus is shifting to
central Turkey," Health Ministry official Turan Buzgan told Reuters
in an interview. Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan said the crisis was
under control.
The outbreak has cast a cloud over Turkish celebrations of the Muslim
Eid al-Adha festival, a major national holiday. Snow and freezing
temperatures in the east of the country are also hampering efforts
to tackle the virus and may be allowing it to survive for longer. 4
people were taken to hospital with suspected bird flu in the town of
Aydin near the Aegean coast -- one of Turkey's most important tourism
centres, adding to concerns the outbreak will harm country's
important tourist trade. Authorities in neighbouring countries
sprayed cars crossing from Turkey with disinfectant and checked
luggage as they tried to stem the spread of bird flu.
The authorities have sent teams of veterinarians in protective white
body suits to a number of regions to cull poultry, seen as the best
method of checking the disease. The mayor of the eastern village of
Dogubayazit, home to the children who died, said many people were
hiding their poultry because they did not believe government promises
that they would be fully compensated. "Many lie to officials and
when vets go to a particular house the wife does not give them up,"
Rauf Ulusoy told Reuters. "We can force them to hand over poultry
under the law, but we are not using that method right now. We ask
kindly," he said.
Parts of suburbs of the capital Ankara and the business hub Istanbul
have been sealed off for the culling of poultry. Inhabitants leaving
the areas have been disinfected. Twelve of 23 people undergoing
tests for bird flu in Istanbul had tested negative.

Turks Urged to Keep Kids Away From Dead Birds
---------------------------------------------
Healthcare authorities urged Turks to keep children away from dead
birds as preliminary tests showed 5 more youths had been stricken
with H5N1 avian influenza virus infection. Turkey has reported 15
suspected or confirmed cases, resulting in 3 deaths, and the new ones
were in 4 separate provinces -- indicating that the disease is spreading.
"It's clear that the virus is well-established in the region," said
Guenael Rodier, a senior World Health Organization official for
communicable diseases. Rodier said the human infections appear to
have resulted from contact with infected domestic birds, but warned
that the chances the virus might mutate into a dangerous form
transmitted from person to person increases with every new case. "The
more humans infected with the avian virus, the more chance it has to
adapt," Rodier said while visiting Dogubayazit, a largely Kurdish
town bordering Iran.
Two teenagers from the same family in Dogubayazit died of avian
influenza last week, the 1st fatalities from H5N1 outside East Asia,
where 74 people have been killed by the H5N1 virus since 2003. A 3rd
sibling also died of bird flu, but a WHO lab has not yet confirmed
H5N1 as the cause. On Monday [9 Jan 2006], a 4th sibling was released
from the hospital in the nearby town of Van after tests indicated he
did not have the disease.
Suspected avian influenza cases are turning up in Turkish villages
hundreds of miles apart, in every section of the country except the
west. Officials said they are near wetlands on the paths of migratory
birds, which have been carrying the disease from country to country.
The outbreaks in Turkey are linked to the close interaction between
humans and animals, which must be minimized, Rodier said. "The front
line between children and animals, particularly backyard poultry, is
too large," he said. The problem was highlighted during efforts to
destroy sick fowl, children would join in, chasing chickens, geese or
ducks with their bare hands.
Turkish labs have detected H5N1 in 5 new cases discovered in 4
provinces in eastern and central Turkey, as well as the Black Sea
coast, Turkish officials said Monday. All 5 were children ages 4 to
12, the Anatolia news agency reported. Two preliminary H5N1 cases
reported Sunday in Ankara, about 600 miles west of Van, involved boys
ages 5 and 2 who apparently caught the virus while playing with
gloves their father used to handle 2 dead wild ducks. An 8-year-old
girl hospitalized in Van apparently contracted the virus by hugging
and kissing dead chickens.
10 people earlier tested positive for H5N1 in tests in Turkish labs,
4 of which have been confirmed by WHO. The Geneva-based agency on
Monday [9 Jan 2006] also classified 10 cases as "preliminary
positive." In addition, more than 60 people with flu-like symptoms
who came in close contact with fowl had been hospitalized around the
country by Monday [9 Jan 2006] and were being tested, officials
said. WHO spokeswoman Maria Cheng expressed concern about the rapid
increase in cases but said a team of experts said "so far it looks
very much like ... these cases were infected through contact with
sick poultry." On Monday [9 Jan 2006], Health Minister Recep Akdag
arrived with WHO officials in Dogubayazit, where many of the cases
originated. "If as a community, we take the necessary measures and
educate (people) we can in a short period of time combat this,"
Akdag said. "We will manage to slow its progress." He said, however,
that because Turkey was on the path of migratory birds, the country
would continue to be at risk in years to come, and urged people to
abandon raising poultry in backyards.

[The encouraging messages from these reports is that there have been
few fatalities so far and that there is no suggestion that the virus
is being transmitted from human-to-human. - Mod.CP]
[At the risk of sticking one's neck on the chopping block, this
moderator cannot help but muse out loud on what may be different here
in Turkey to explain the major increase in human disease that is
being seen -- a somewhat different pattern than had been seen with
H5N1 disease in Southeast Asia. One obvious possibility is that the
virus itself has changed so that the species jump from avian to human
infection is now easier.
But, what if the circumstances in the country (Turkey) are
different: 1st, perhaps there is a greater coverage of the rural
population with the formal health sector, so that when illness
occurs, the population automatically seeks medical care -- hence,
more cases are coming to the attention of the health sector than do
in the Southeast Asian countries (a component of "seek and ye shall
find"). 2nd, perhaps the formal health sector in Turkey has just
implemented an avian influenza preparedness plan so the clinicians
are very sensitized to report cases of respiratory illness and send
appropriate specimens for testing (another component of "seek and ye
shall find"). 3rd, it appears as though a primary factor with
respect to human disease seems to be contact with 'backyard flocks'
of avians, and not necessarily general exposure to migratory birds
that may be infected. It is now winter in Turkey, where temperatures
drop low enough that the practice is for these 'backyard flock'
avians to be brought into the same living quarters as the families
that own them. This practice is thereby placing the diseased avian
population in much closer proximity to humans. In contrast, in
Southeast Asia the avian population remains outside of the general
living quarters so human to avian infected particle contact may be
reduced from that seen when the same housing structure is
shared. Thus, this practice (bringing 'backyard flocks' into homes)
may lead to an increased exposure to live virus. We await further
information on epidemiologic and laboratory investigations. - Mod.MPP]
