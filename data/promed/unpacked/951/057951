Some Fonterra products used in infant formula and sports drinks may contain a bacterium that causes botulism, the company announced early today [3 Aug 2013]. Fonterra said that on Wednesday [31 Jul 2013] tests indicated the potential presence of a strain of Clostridium (_Clostridium botulinum_) in a whey concentrate sample, which can produce a potent neurotoxin that causes botulism.

The company said that it today [3 Aug 2013] had advised 8 of its customers of a "quality issue" involving 3 batches of a particular type of whey protein concentrate (WPC80) produced at a single New Zealand manufacturing site in May 2012. As a result, these customers are urgently investigating whether any of the affected product is in their supply chains. If need be, they will initiate consumer product recalls.

There have been no reports of any illness linked to consumption of the affected whey protein, Fonterra said in a statement. Dairy products such as fresh milk, yoghurt, cheese, spreads and UHT milk products are not affected, it said. Fonterra had initially identified a potential quality issue in March 2013, when a product tested positive for _Clostridium_. There are hundreds of different strains of _Clostridium_, the majority of which are harmless, the company said.

Product samples were put through intensive testing over the following months. On Wed 31 Jul 2013, tests indicated the potential presence of a strain (_Clostridium botulinum_) in a sample, which can cause botulism.

The particular whey protein concentrate concerned is used by Fonterra's customers in a range of products including infant formula, growing up milk powder and sports drinks, said Gary Romano, Managing Director, NZ Milk Products. "For this reason, we immediately contacted our customers and the appropriate authorities so that any potentially affected product could be removed from the marketplace. We are working with our customers and will provide more information and updates as they become available," Mr Romano said.

Fonterra told a news conference today [3 Aug 2013] that investigations had isolated the cause of the contamination. A piece of pipe was not sterilized properly and was used during production of 3 batches. The piece of equipment was subsequently cleaned and further product tested was clear.

The organism is present in soils, and small amounts of dust accumulated in the pipe and triggered the contamination, the company said. Any consumer product recalls that may need to take place will be initiated by the respective food companies.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated with the food products. Most of the food recalls (as in this case) are related to defective preparation procedures, which could, but not necessarily do, result in the germination of viable spores of _C. botulinum_. This posting specifically mentions that _C. botulinum_ did contaminate the product. In the usual case of foodborne botulism, preformed toxin has been produced in the food which is ingested. In infant botulism, however, spores of the bacterium are ingested and germinate in the gut, producing toxin in vivo. - Mod.LL

[It would have been helpful if the brand names of the contaminated products (infant formula and sports drinks) had been given, to alert consumers. These products have been in the marketplace for at least 6 months, and may still be on consumers' food storage shelves. - Mod.JW]
