Herds infected with anthrax in Canada in 2012
---------------------------------------------
Findings of anthrax in Western Canada are not uncommon. The spores that cause the disease are known to exist in soil across the Canadian prairies. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) works with provincial and municipal colleagues and industry to address the risk of anthrax.

Anthrax is a reportable disease under the Health of Animals Regulations. This means that all suspected cases must be reported to the CFIA.

The following table lists herds confirmed to be infected with anthrax in Canada in 2012.

Current as of: 26 Jul 2012
Date confirmed / Location / Animal type infected
23 Jul 2012 / RM of Kinistino (No. 459) / Cattle

[This report has just been posted by the CFIA. We await further information. The farm's location in the very northern border of agriculture in Saskatchewan would suggest that it a small holding with normally minimal veterinary contact.

There is a map on the CFIA site showing where RM Kinistino is. - Mod.MHJ
