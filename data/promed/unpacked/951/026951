Outbreak of rubella in Lviv oblast [region]
-------------------------------------------
According to the regional public health authority of Lviv oblast an
increase of rubella incidence has been recorded among people born
between 1981 and 1989. 18 cases were registered in January 2011,
whereas by comparison only 32 cases were registered throughout the
whole of 2010. 28 per cent of the rubella cases had received one dose
of rubella vaccine, 3 per cent had received 2 doses, and the remainder
had unknown immunization status. The affected age group is a cause of
concern since it includes women of fertile age.

[Rubella (German measles) is an infectious viral disease. It can
cause a high temperature (fever) of 38 deg C (100.4 deg F) or over,
and a distinctive red-pink rash. In most cases, rubella is a mild
condition, but it can be serious in pregnant women because it can harm
the unborn baby. Rubella virus is transmitted through droplets in the
air from the coughs and sneezes of infected people, and it is about as
infectious as influenza. Anyone can get rubella, but young children
are most commonly affected.

Congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) is an important cause of severe
birth defects. When a woman is infected with the rubella virus early
in pregnancy, she has a 90 per cent chance of passing the virus on to
her fetus. This can cause the death of the fetus, or it may cause CRS.
Even though it is a mild childhood illness CRS causes many birth
defects. Deafness is the most common, but CRS can also cause defects
in the eyes, heart, and brain.

Live attenuated viral rubella vaccine is the 'R' component in the
triple MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] vaccine. - Mod.CP]
