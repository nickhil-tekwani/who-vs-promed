Outbreak of Measles in King County, Washington State
------------------------------------
A total of 8 cases of measles (rubeola/'red measles') have been been
confirmed in King County in the past 3 weeks, and another is suspected.
None has been reported outside King County. Health officials expect more
cases and calls continue to come into the Seattle and King County Public
Health [Departments from area residents who believe they were exposed to
this highly contagious disease and have symptoms. Usually only a few cases
are reported statewide each year.
"We fully anticipate more confirmed cases, given the broad range of public
exposure," said James Apa, a spokesman for the Department. Officials said
no [patients so far have experienced complications. According to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, complications occur in about 30
per cent of cases, including 18 per cent who require [admission to
hospital. Complications are most common among children younger than 5 and
adults [aged 20 and older. The disease can be particularly difficult for
adults. The commonest complications are diarrhea (8 per cent), ear
infections (7 per cent, almost all in children), and pneumonia, the
commonest cause of death (6 per cent). About 1 in 1000 cases results in
encephalitis, coma, and long term damage such as deafness. About 2 cases in
1000 [are fatal: in children, usually from pneumonia, and in adults,
usually from encephalitis.
"The unimmunized can be a danger in the community. When there are more
unimmunized individuals, the disease is more likely to spread," said Dr.
Edgar Marcuse, an expert on immunizations at the children's [hospital.
More than 90 per cent of the population is immunized, either from being
vaccinated or from having had the disease. About 98 per cent of school-age
children have had the 2 vaccinations needed for complete immunization.
About 95 per cent of those who receive only one dose, given at [the age of
12 to 15 months, are immune; and more than 99 per cent are immune after the
second dose, usually given before entering school.

virulent virus. - Mod.CP
