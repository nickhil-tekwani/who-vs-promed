In a follow-up on a report in August 2021, health officials in Osorno confirmed an increase in confirmed cases of psittacosis, which would have originated in agricultural companies in Puerto Octay, Los Lagos region.

The new cases are linked with the index case, the 28-year-old veterinarian who at the end of July 2021 was admitted in serious condition due to pneumonia at the San Jos√© Base hospital, being transferred at life risk to Santiago and with an unconfirmed diagnosis, later to work in companies in the lake district. At that time he was suspected of having Q Fever. It would be later when the Institute of Public Health confirmed that his infection was caused by _Chlamydophila psittaci_, a type of bacteria found in bird droppings, which transmit the infection to humans.

Since then, the health network activated an emergency protocol to investigate other cases, as revealed by the epidemiologist of the Seremi de Salud [Regional Ministerial Health Secretariats] in Osorno, Cristian Rosas. Rosa indicated that to date the confirmed cases amount to 15 who have shown positive antibodies to _Chlamydophila_, for which they maintain studies that they estimate will last until the end of 2021.

The source of the disease is still under investigation.

[It is unclear what symptoms, if any, the other confirmed cases had and what links they had to the avian reservoirs of the infection.

Psittacosis, also known as ornithosis or parrot fever, is a human disease caused by the bacterium _Chlamydophila psittaci_. Classically associated with psittacine birds such as parakeets, parrots, and cockatiels, it may affect other avian species such as turkeys, ducks, pigeons, and pheasants. Human infection in general is caused by inhalation of dust containing the bacterium, which is shed in large amounts in the feces and secretions of the infected birds. Illegally imported decorative birds that have not been screened and/or treated, can be a significant source of the pathogen.

The respiratory infection, usually diagnosed serologically, can be fatal if untreated. Although most diagnosed cases have direct exposure to birds, the infection may be acquired indirectly through the aerosolization of infective material in the grass or ground such as when mowing a lawn. Because of such outbreaks, protective equipment may be recommended for individuals in areas frequented by free-ranging birds if contact with birds and their droppings is likely when performing outdoor activities such as lawn mowing.

People who are occupationally exposed to psittacosis include pet store workers, poultry farmers, poultry processing workers, and veterinarians. - Mod.LL
