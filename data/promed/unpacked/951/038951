[The Chin Humanitarian Update of 4 Mar 2011 reported that around 30
000 malaria cases were reported in Chin State of Myanmar in 2010.
There is neither information on the numbers of hospital admissions nor
the number of malaria related deaths. Further information about the
malaria situation in Chin State or in Myanmar would be much
appreciated.

Malaria is the most important tropical, life-threatening disease
caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through the bites
of infected mosquitoes. It is endemic in 105 countries and is
responsible for over 300 to 500 million clinical cases and more than a
million deaths each year. 4 species of protozoan parasite of the
_Plasmodium_ genus -- _P. falciparum_, _P. vivax_, _P. ovale_, and _P.
malariae_ -- cause malaria in humans. Though malaria bought on by _P.
vivax_ is the most common, it is, however, malaria caused by _P.
falciparum_ that is most lethal. The clinical features of malaria
vary. The classic symptoms include persistent fever, shivering, joint
pains, and headaches and repeated vomiting. Severe and complicated
malaria causing renal failure, hypoglycemia, anemia, pulmonary edema,

shock, and coma can have fatal consequences, leading to death.

Malaria can be cured if promptly diagnosed and adequately treated.
Treatment and control have become more difficult with the spread of
drug-resistant strains of parasites and insecticide-resistant strains
of mosquito vectors. According to the WHO report of Malaria situation
in the South East Asia Region, which is available at
<http://www.searo.who.int/en/Section10/Section21/Section340_4024.htm>,
malaria is one of the major public health problems in Myanmar with
around 40.6 million people at risk. Although much of the population is
at risk of malaria, the most vulnerable are non-immune migrant workers
occupied with gem-mining in forests, logging, agriculture, and
construction. Annually, around 200 000 confirmed malaria cases
and around 1200 malaria deaths are recorded.

Myanmar has reported an increase in the number of confirmed malaria
cases from 120 029 in 2000 to 447 073 in 2008 and 414 008 in 2009,
respectively. The number of malaria admissions and malaria attributed
deaths declined from 85 409 and 2752 respectively in 2000 to 47 772
and 972 respectively in 2009. Among inpatient admissions, the
proportion of malaria cases declined from 16 per cent in 2000 to 6-7
per cent of all admissions in 2008-09. These statistics suggest that
there is some improvement in the malaria situation in the country.

Malaria is endemic in Myanmar, with about one million suspected cases
in 2010 (World Malaria Report 2010
(<http://www.who.int/malaria/world_malaria_report_2010/wmr2010_annex7a.pdf>).

Chin State is located in the western part of Myanmar not far from
Assam and Bangladesh; see HealthMap at <http://healthmap.org/r/0zxY>.
