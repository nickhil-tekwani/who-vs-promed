A heartbroken woman was forced to have euthanized her 5 family dogs after becoming the first person in the UK to be diagnosed with a rare infectious disease. The woman, 61, was left with no choice but to euthanize her dogs after they contracted _Brucella canis_ from a Belarusian rescue dog she was fostering. The infected dog Moosha had only been with the woman for 3 days before she started aborting her puppies all over the home in a "horrific" experience that lasted 17 hours. She was initially put on a "stay at home" notice due to a fear of rabies - but both she and the dog were eventually diagnosed with the rare disease 2 months later.

Human transmission is extremely rare, but the grandmother-of-2 also started showing severe symptoms and remains on antibacterials. But her dogs, Benson, a 13-year-old Jack Russell, Dougie, an 11-year-old Patterdale Cross, Tiny, a 4-year-old Pug, and Max, 9, an unknown breed, could not be saved - leaving the woman and her family distraught.

She said: "It felt so unreal, to think about how many people are in the UK, to think that this is the first ever for this type of strain. The doctors were actually quite excited." The woman, who is married and has a son and 2 grandkids, said she most likely contracted the disease through Moosha's birthing fluids and the rescue dog had to be put down. She was then faced with the heartbreaking reality that she would have to put her own 4 dogs down due to them living in such close contact.

She said: "All 5 dogs were put down, they were the innocent party in this. I blame this rescue, and I blame the Government for letting it happen and not testing."

The woman said she brought Moosha, believed to be a German Shepherd cross, over through a rescue dog company, which mainly sources stray dogs from Ukraine and Belarus. Once dogs test positive for _Brucella canis_ they can be infected for life. It is mainly transmitted through a dog's bodily fluids, such as urine, blood, and saliva, and in extremely rare cases can be passed on to humans.

She added: "There was no real choice, there was no real quality of life for them. Benson, Douggie and Max (another foster dog) were positive while Tiny had tested negative, but was at a high risk of positive."

The woman said "I went to the hospital on [23 May 2022]. I went to my GP because I felt quite poorly and he sent me straight up to the hospital that day. I hadn't been feeling well before that, but I put it down to stress after Moosha was taken. I was moved to the infectious disease ward at Stoke hospital. I didn't get a diagnosis until [Fri 27 May 2022] because they had a very clued-up doctor, who suggested it was _Brucella canis_. They let me out the following Thursday [2 Jun 2022], but I had the nurses coming out to me for 2-and-a-half weeks giving me antibiotics."

In the hospital, Wendy suffered a high temperature, chills, and shivers, bad shakes, severe headaches, severe backache, and low blood pressure. Because she was immune-compromised the disease hit her harder than it would do for most.

[_Brucella canis_ was initially recognized as an agent causing canine abortions by Carmichael in 1967 (1). Subsequently, human infections were diagnosed, primarily in laboratory workers as well as dog owners. It was shown by the CDC in 1975 (2) that routine brucella agglutinin testing is not helpful for _B. canis_ infection in dogs or humans and a more specific assay is now available (3). The manifestations of _B. canis_ in humans can be varied. Complications of this infection can occur including osteomyelitis, endocarditis, mycotic aneurysms and granulomatous hepatitis (3).

[Dogs are thought to be the only significant hosts for _B. canis_ among domesticated animals. The bacterium is an important cause of reproductive failure, especially in kennels. Infections can result in abortions and stillbirths in bitches, and epididymitis, prostatitis, orchitis, and sperm abnormalities in males. Although spayed or neutered dogs do not have reproductive signs, they occasionally develop other conditions such as ocular disease and discospondylitis. Notably, the shedding of _B. canis_ by male dogs is not excluded by their neutering; they may excrete the virus in urine, and this should be considered when assessing the risk for transmission to other dogs or to humans. _B. canis_ may persist in an animal even after antibacterial treatment. In kennels, infected dogs are often euthanized to prevent them from infecting other dogs or people. Canine brucellosis is sometimes difficult to diagnose with the currently available tests. Human infection may occur during the delivery of bitches, during which attenders may be exposed to contact with the placenta and other secretions.

In recent years, increased incidence of _B. canis_ has been reported in countries importing dogs from East European countries. A Dutch paper addressed 18 infected dogs; all were mixed-breed rescue dogs imported from Romania (n=7), Bulgaria (n=10), and Croatia (n=1). Other sources mentioned Russia and Ukraine. Stray dogs have been found to present higher infection rates, compared to owned dogs.
