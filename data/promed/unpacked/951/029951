Plum pox potyvirus in here all along
-----------------------------------------
Officials from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) confirm that plum
pox disease has been in the Niagara region for at least 8 years. Farmers
unwittingly threw away peaches bearing the tell-tale rings on infected
fruit, not knowing that they were infected with the disease. The virus,
first observed in Europe in 1932, was detected in a Pennsylvania peach
orchard in 1999 and subsequently found in the Niagara region in the spring
of this year. Adrian Huisman, manager of the Ontario Tender Fruit Producers
Marketing Board, said that the disease has been in Ontario for at least 8
to 10 years.

[This latest development suggests that the virus may be more widely spread
than first thought. Eradication is the only option at present. It is likely
that there are other sites in addition to the Niagara region, Essex County
and Chatham in which infected trees will be found. The possibility of the
virus having spread to British Columbia and other parts of eastern Canada
is a real concern. -Mod.DH
