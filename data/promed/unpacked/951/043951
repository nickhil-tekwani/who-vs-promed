Measles being brought under control in Shenzhen city
----------------------------------------------------
Yesterday [20 Oct 2008], Shenzhen's Center for Disease Control
announced that from January to September [2008], there were 2156
cases of measles in Shenzhen [sub-province of Guangdong province], an
incidence of 25.4/100 000. The number of cases had declined 49.8
percent over the same period in 2007. Sources say that over the past
2 years, due to the high incidence of disease in the migrant
population, measles incidence in Shenzhen [and Guangdong province]
has always ranked high. From January to March of this year [2008]
there was a substantial increase in measles in Shenzhen. As a result
of more vigorous vaccination efforts, disease incidence in Shenzhen
gradually declined after May and has been held at a relatively low
level.

Sources say that most reported measles cases in Shenzhen this year
[2008] were in populations under 2 years of age and over 20 years of
age, comprising 75.7 percent of cases. Of these, 17.2 percent were
infants less than 8 months old who could not have been protected by
vaccination [because their immune systems are too young for the
vaccine to take. - Mod.JW]. Most patients were children living in
dispersed areas and workers, comprising 76.6 percent of all cases.
[Giving rates to one place of decimals gives a false idea of the
accuracy of the statistics. They should be rounded off. - Mod.JW]

Experts from the city's Center for Disease Control said that from
2001 to 2007, measles incidence in Shenzhen generally increased. In
2007, measles accounted for 18.4 percent of Class A and B infectious
diseases in Shenzhen, and measles cases increased 131.1 percent over
2006.

This year [2008], after a supplementary immunization campaign,
implementation of national immunization policies, and other methods
to strengthen control and prevention, the number of measles cases in
Shenzhen was effectively reduced, obtaining excellent results.

In order to expand immunization work in Shenzhen more thoroughly, the
Shenzhen Bureau of Health yesterday [20 Oct 2008] launched a 4-day
full-scale investigation of the immunization status of the city's
children.

[The investigation] will evaluate Shenzhen's management of
immunization planning and continuing problems, and will provide
scientific evidence for the establishment of immunization strategies
and policies. Sources say the main form of this investigation will be
random investigation. The target of the investigation will be
children born between 1 Oct 2004 and 30 Sep 2007. The main contents
will be the rates of primary BCG [tuberculosis], polio, DTP
[diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis], hepatitis B, measles , and
Japanese encephalitis vaccination, as well as the rates of booster
DTP, measles, and Japanese encephalitis vaccination. Results of the
investigation will be published in November [2008].

Disease control experts say that all children of suitable age can
receive free nationally-mandated immunizations at hospitals and
neighborhood health centers near to where they live, regardless of
whether they hold Shenzhen residence permits or whether they live in
Shenzhen temporarily or permanently. From 1 Sep 2008, when Shenzhen
formally launched the national immunization campaign there has been a
clear increase in the number of suitably-aged children receiving
nationally-mandated free immunizations or boosters. Now, Shenzhen
offers 11 types of immunizations free of charge for suitably-aged
children, including hepatitis B, BCG, polio, DTP, TP [?], measles,
Japanese encephalitis, hepatitis A, Group A meningococcal, Group A +
C meningococcal vaccines, and vaccines containing measles, mumps, and
rubella components (MMR). [Other vaccines will be introduced as they
become available.]

[This report highlight the difficulties of achieving high vaccine
coverage in populations with a high proportion of migrant workers.
The report from Shenzhen indicates that some success is being
achieved following the implementation of a free national immunisation
strategy targeting measles and 10 other major diseases.
