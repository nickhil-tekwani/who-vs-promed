Another outbreak of highly contagious bee disease found in
Perthshire
---------------------------------------------------------------------
A 2nd outbreak of a highly infectious bee disease has been recorded
at an apiary in Perthshire. The detection of the American Foulbrood
disease, near Meigle, in Perthshire, has resulted in the infected hive
being destroyed.

On Friday [15 Jul 2011] the outbreak at the apiary was confirmed by
laboratory diagnosis at the Science and Advice for Scottish
Agriculture. The outbreak came after one last month at an apiary near
Ballinluig, which also caused the destruction of a hive.

There are no risks to public health from American Foulbrood and no
implications for the quality and safety of honey. Scottish Government
bee inspectors are due to examine the site in the coming days, while
the movement of bees and related equipment into or out of the affected
apiary is prohibited.

Beekeepers are urged to check their hives and notify any suspicion of
disease to <beesmailbox@scotland.gsi.gov.uk>.
