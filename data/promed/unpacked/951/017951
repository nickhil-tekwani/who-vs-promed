There have been 365 cases of dengue fever reported nationwide, with
nearly 900 suspected cases, informed today Dr. Ivan Allende, Head of
Transmissible Diseases Division from the Public Health Ministry.
Dr. Allende emphasized that The Social Welfare Institute is also
cooperating with the campaign against dengue by creating an urgent
care medical office for dengue fever patients; additionally, the
Armed Forces are supporting outpatient care.
"In order to eliminate mosquitoes, environmental temperature should
be 6 to 9 degree C. It has been nearly one month since interventional
measures were implemented; on 24 Mar we initiated all interventions
during this dengue fever epidemics in Paraguay", added Dr. Allende.
He mentioned that the outbreak of dengue fever is still restricted to
Asuncion and Central areas. Even though there are cases reported from
other Departrments, nearly 100 percent of them have a
well-corroborated epidemiological link with Asuncion or [some?] other
destination in Brazil.
"The current outbreak is still active, since we are still reporting
cases with a recent onset of symptoms, and this is a reason for
concern, since it means that we will continue having cases throughout
April. Estimates indicate an outbreak that is currently affecting
between 3 to 9 persons in contact with an index case, and this leads
to additional estimates that we will have 300 cases as a minimum, and
900 cases as the maximum figure in this outbreak", pointed out Dr. Allende.
