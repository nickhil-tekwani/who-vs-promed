The highly pathogenic bird flu, or avian influenza [HPAI], has been detected at a turkey farm in northern France, causing the cull of at least 8000 turkeys, French daily news Le Figaro reported on Monday [1 Aug 2022].

"Regulated protection and surveillance zones have been set up within a radius of 3-10 km," local authorities of the city of Feuilleres, in the northern department of Somme of France, said in a press release. The first outbreak of the high pathogenic bird flu was found on Saturday [30 Jul 2022] at the turkey farm. According to the release, all places of poultry and captive birds are subject to specific measures, in particular the prohibition of movements of poultry and captive birds. The state veterinary services are mobilized alongside the breeder who will be compensated for the losses suffered.

Since November 2021, France has reported more than 1300 outbreaks of HPAI virus and ordered the cull of 20 million birds. During the period from autumn 2020 to spring 2021, 500 outbreaks of HPAI were detected and 3.5 million birds culled in the country.

[According to the French Ministry of Agriculture (3 Aug 2022), the national health situation with regard to avian influenza had improved in France since the beginning of May 2022, with the return to a level of risk classified as "negligible". However, since mid-May, a sharp increase in cases has been observed in "indigenous" wildlife on the Channel coast, where grouped mortalities of coastal birds were first observed in the coastal departments of Hauts de France (departments (Nord, Pas-de-Calais, Somme). They were followed in June 2022 by bird mortalities on the Normandy coasts (departments Seine-maritime, Calvados, Manche) and later, in July 2022, on the Brittany coasts (CÃ´tes d'Armor). Since then, these mortalities have been continuing on the 7 named coastal departments with some spread inland.

The scale and time of this event are exceptional -- never encountered earlier in France. Environmental contamination remains high in the affected regions with sporadic introductions into poultry farms. Two outbreaks in breeding flocks have been confirmed, on 29 and 30 Jul 2022: one in the Manche (a coastal Department in Normandy) and the other one in Somme (a northern Department, part of the Hauts-de-France region).

The increase in cases of HPAI in wildlife extends to other countries of the European Union, at coastal level.

For the said and additional information, see https://bit.ly/3zyyoc3 (in French). The review concludes: "Strict compliance with biosecurity rules and bird monitoring are more important than ever."

France submitted its recent HPAI follow-up reports to the World Organisation for Animal Health on 1 Aug 2022: FUR No 27 on poultry, available at https://wahis.woah.org/#/report-info?reportId=57964 and FUR No 24 on non-poultry (wild birds), available at https://wahis.woah.org/#/report-info?reportId=57960.

Both are "ongoing". - Mod.AS
