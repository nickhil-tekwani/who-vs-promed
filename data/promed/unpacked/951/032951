Mass antelopes die off - Russia (Zabaykalsky krai)
--------------------------------------------------
According to residents along the Mongolian border, wild antelopes are
dying in large numbers in Zabaykalsky krai [region]. These animals are
listed in the Red Book [Red Data Book of the Russian Federation for
documenting rare and endangered species of animals, plants, and fungi]
because of their rarity. Specialists say that the cause might be
foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). The local veterinary services have begun
additional FMD vaccination covering 182 000 cattle and sheep.

During their migration, the antelopes damaged a 6 km [approx. 4 mi]
section of fencing along the border. An alternative cause of this die
off could be the lack of feed. The spontaneous migration of these
animals from Mongolia started at the end of the last year [2009] and
was explained by the lack of feed there.

[There was no information on the web about FMD outbreaks at the end of
2009 in Mongolia. However, there was an outbreak of FMD in China in
2009, which borders both Russia and Mongolia. The risk of FMD spread
in Russia is a real one. About 100 species of wild animals, including
many cloven-footed species, are susceptible to FMD. The sources of
infection are sick, recovered animals, and those in the incubation
period. The virus is excreted with the saliva, milk, excrements and
exhaled air. The infection occurs through the digestive tract, the
mucosa of the nose and the mouth, also via damaged skin. - Mod.NP

The Zabaykalsky krai is located within the historical region of
Transbaikalia. It has extensive international borders with China (998
km) and Mongolia (868 km/620 mi) and internal borders with the Russian
Irkutsk and Amur oblasts [provinces], as well as with the Buryat and
the Sakha Republics. See maps at

<http://healthmap.org/r/0140>

Details on the species involved and its migration season and route
will help. In February 2004, Mongolia reported to the OIE an outbreak
of FMD serotype O, which was suspected to originate from migrating
wild gazelles -- see ProMED-mail 20040219.0540 & 20040213.0485.

FMD outbreaks in antelopes of several species, in some cases
characterised by high mortalities, have been recorded in the past in
several geographical locations, mainly in Africa and Asia. One such
outbreak, affecting the Saigak (Saiga) antelope, was reported from
Kazakhstan during the late 1960's. The disease spread along the
long-distance north-south annual migration of the animals, at that
time counting several hundred thousands. Among the signs observed was
the loss of horns and hooves, and considerable mortality (Kindyakov,
Nagumanov, et al (1970); Veterinariya 47, 52).

Confirmation, and in particular details on the FMDV serotype involved,
are requested. - Mod.AS]
