Scientists at the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution say they have
discovered a new virus in wild dolphins in the Indian River Lagoon. 4
dolphins had tumors that had never been seen in wild populations.
Scientists say they might have a strain of a herpesvirus.
The animals were analyzed as part of a 5-year health assessment study.
Scientists are comparing dolphins in the lagoon with other wild and captive
populations.
The Indian River team has found skin fungus, gastric inflammation, and
other health problems in the dolphins. One scientist says the [poor] health
of the ecosystem may be to blame for the illnesses.

[Indeed, it would seem worthwhile to examine the ecosystem and possible
toxins and pollutants, with so many different ailments affecting dolphins
in that area. - Mod.TG]
