[excerpts]
... At the WHO meeting today and tomorrow [29-30 Sep 2014], experts are discussing the many thorny issues that will arise if one or both of the vaccines successfully pass their phase I trials. From then on, they should be distributed widely in the affected countries, says Jeremy Farrar, an epidemiologist and head of the Wellcome Trust research charity in London. "I think the big question now is how do we do this while gathering sufficient safety and efficacy data to be confident that we are doing good," Farrar says.

[Anthony Fauci, director of NIAID in Bethesda, Maryland,] believes that a randomized, controlled trial, in which people receive either the actual Ebola vaccine or an unrelated shot such as the hepatitis B vaccine, will be needed. "If you are going to deploy a vaccine widely within a country, you better be sure it's effective," he says. But others don't see the use of placebos as an option. "You create a group of people who are not vaccinated and they don't know it," Kobinger says. "If I were a volunteer, I would not be comfortable with this personally."

Farrar agrees; what's more, a placebo-controlled study just isn't feasible, he says. "We are talking about a totally destroyed health care system across Liberia and, to an extent, Sierra Leone," Farrar says. "We just have to be practical." That doesn't mean scientists will be unable to say if the vaccine works, he says. Urban areas like Monrovia will inevitably receive the vaccine before it reaches other, more rural parts of the country; scientists can compare the incidence of Ebola in both areas, in a so-called step-wedge study design. "If you have a 90 percent effective vaccine, you will see that immediately."

Supply is likely to be a problem. GSK [GlaxoSmithKline] has pledged to produce about 10 000 doses by the end of the year [2014], paid for by the Wellcome Trust and others. The company is already working on how to scale up production, however, if data from the 1st volunteers show that the vaccine does not cause harm and their immune systems have responses similar to what protected monkeys in experiments that attempted to infect them with Ebola virus. 1st signs of that could be available in less than a month, Ballou says. "We would not start producing very large numbers unless we had some evidence that the vaccine has a potential to work," he says.

Production of the [Canadian-developed] VSV vaccine is already being ramped up. The more than 800 vials now stored in Winnipeg could yield a few thousand doses, Kobinger says, depending on the exact amount needed per dose. "We're manufacturing additional supply as we speak," Wiley says. "And we expect to have the capacity to manufacture tens of thousands of doses by the end of the year [2014]." 2 other vaccines, another one based on VSV and one using a modified poxvirus, are a few months behind in development.

At this week's meeting, experts will again discuss who gets the vaccine first. Most participants at an earlier ethics meeting said health workers should have priority, because they are essential in fighting Ebola while also at a high risk of contracting it. Moreover, the protection of a vaccine could help convince doctors and nurses to work in the affected countries. The vaccine would also be given to others involved in the outbreak, such as cleaners, ambulance drivers, or burial teams, Farrar says.

But offering the vaccine to patients' families could increase the likelihood that they come forward, which would help detection and control. Participants at the earlier panel agreed that children and pregnant women were particularly vulnerable and should also be prioritized.

Another question is which country to concentrate on. Should early doses be sent to Liberia, where the epidemic seems to be growing the fastest, or to Guinea, which has been on the verge of containing Ebola at least twice? "You could make a good case for either one," says Brian Greenwood, an epidemiologist specializing in vaccines at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, who is chairing a session at the meeting. "These are all very difficult questions, and this is why you do need to get a lot of brains together of the people that really know about this from different aspects and try to come to some sort of a consensus."

[2] Orphans: UNICEF
Date: Tue 30 Sep 2014
Source: BBC News Africa [edited]
http://bbc.com/news/world-africa-29424919


At least 3700 children in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone who have lost one or both parents to Ebola this year [2014] face being shunned, the UN has said. Carers were urgently needed for these orphans, Unicef said. A basic human reaction like comforting a sick child has been turned "into a potential death sentence", it added.

The figure on the number of Ebola orphans follows a 2-week assessment mission by the UN children's agency to the 3 countries worst-affected by the outbreak. An earlier version of this story said that 4900 children had lost parents but the correct figure is 3700. It found that children as young as 3 or 4 years old were being orphaned by the disease. Children were discovered alone in the hospitals where their parents had died, or back in their communities where, if they were lucky, they were being fed by neighbours -- but all other contact with them was being avoided. "Thousands of children are living through the deaths of their mother, father, or family members from Ebola," Unicef's Manuel Fontaine said in statement about his 2-week visit to the region. "These children urgently need special attention and support; yet many of them feel unwanted and even abandoned," he said. "Orphans are usually taken in by a member of the extended family, but in some communities, the fear surrounding Ebola is becoming stronger than family ties."

The number of Ebola orphans has spiked in the past few weeks and preliminary reports suggest that it is likely to double by mid-October [2014], Unicef said. There was an urgent need to establish a system for identifying and caring for Ebola orphans, it said. Unicef will be holding a meeting on the issue in Sierra Leone next month [October 2014] but before then it wants potential carers to come forward. "Ebola is turning a basic human reaction like comforting a sick child into a potential death sentence," Mr Fontaine said. "We cannot respond to a crisis of this nature and this scale in the usual ways. We need more courage, more creativity, and far, far more resources."

[3] Sierra Leone: deaths recount
Date: Mon 29 Sep 2014
Source: Awareness Times (Sierra Leone News & Information) [edited]
http://news.sl/drwebsite/publish/article_200526287.shtml


[Dr Sylvia Blyden is the Special Executive Assistant to the Sierra Leone President, who regularly engages citizens on social media.]

In response to the numerous queries, Dr Blyden on Sat 27 Sep 2014 took time to write the following, which instantly went viral as it, for the 1st time, comprehensively showed cause of under-estimates.

Update by Dr Sylvia Blyden [edited]
-----------------------------------
Let me thank all who have posed observations and questions to me about the incomprehensible difference in totals of announced lab-confirmed cases versus number of survivors and number of deaths. You are all quite right that the difference is currently like 1000 and clearly, such a large number of over 1000 Ebola patients, are not to be found in health centers around the country. You are quite correct! So, where are these compatriots?

The fact is that a few of these unaccounted-for numbers are currently admitted in Ebola centers but I can categorically state today [27 Sep 2014] that the vast majority of the [over] 1000 patients are already dead and lying in their graves.

As some have repeatedly stated for months now, the numbers we are being given from Health Ministry as official Ebola death figures are incorrect. Before going further, let me state that the initial appearance of the hitherto unknown Ebola disease was a strange situation for us to handle and as can be perfectly understood, we had a tough learning curve during which we, as a country, made a series of blunders. One such blunder is the reason behind the erroneous death figures.

Let me explain. The erroneous death figures within the laboratory-confirmed category, are NOT caused by deliberate massaging but a flight of common sense; probably caused by the stress of what was unfolding on us. What am I saying here? Please read the following explanation carefully...

Now, most of the missing patients not currently accounted for, have resulted from a policy where sick patients blood samples are collected from them in their villages and towns and these samples taken to the lab in Kenema, Kailahun, or Freetown for testing whilst the patients were left behind in their communities, waiting for their results. By the time the results were available as confirmed positive and health officials prepared and went back to the villages/towns with ambulances to collect the patients, only a few were met still alive. Many of these patients (most of whom had been seriously ill), had already died in their communities and been buried. May their souls rest in perfect peace.

Now here comes the 'interesting' part. Former Health Minister Miatta Kargbo and former World Health Organisation Representative Dr Jacob Mufunda, had ordered that only deaths inside clinical facilities were to be recognised as "confirmed deaths" to be announced. So, all those laboratory positive patients who died in their towns and villages before they could be collected in ambulances for treatment at Ebola Centers, were never announced as deaths though already announced amongst number of laboratory positive cases. These unannounced deaths of our compatriots, ran up to hundreds of deaths of laboratory confirmed cases.

This is the simple reason behind the incorrect death figures in the laboratory confirmed categories. Sierra Leone was not counting our compatriots who died outside of health facilities.

This grave error that resulted in skewed death figures, was immediately picked up by the new Health Minister, Dr Abu Bakarr Fofanah, on assuming office and, in a poignant presentation to the Presidential Task Force on Ebola which included all top international diplomats, opposition party leaders, SLMDA [Sierra Leone Medical & Dental Association] doctors and key civil society members, the Health Minister Dr Abu Bakarr Fofanah carefully explained what had been happening under the watch of his predecessor. You just need to read the US Embassy's Facebook updates posted after that Presidential Task Force meeting. (Check 8 Sep and 10 Sep 2014 US Embassy updates. They speak volumes).

So, based on analytic presentation of the new Health Minister, it is now a Government policy that the death figures being announced for laboratory confirmed cases, should be reviewed -- eventually. The Health Minister has already informed the CDC and the WHO on this.

As you can well imagine, after impending review, the death rates, case fatality rate (CFR), and other attendant aspects will be significantly changed and a better understanding of the serious gravity of what is unfolding in Sierra Leone, will be known by the whole world. Please brace yourselves. The news is not good. However, rest assured that working together, we can overcome Ebola.

In addition, the review will also ensure proper inclusion of all suspected and probable deaths as per World Health Organisation definitions. Keen observers might have noticed that it is only recently, in last one month, that an attempt has been made to include suspected and probable deaths in the death numbers being announced.

Fellow Citizens and Friends of Sierra Leone, let us continue to keep our beautiful country's Ebola crisis in the mainstream of the world's attention. We have a very, very serious situation on our hands.

We made a lot of mistakes in the early stages because we had a steep learning curve. However, we can no longer blame a steep learning curve for any more mistakes. Let us gear up against Ebola!
