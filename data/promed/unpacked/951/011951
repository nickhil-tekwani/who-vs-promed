[1] Surge in COVID cases
[A] Portugal
Date: Tue 26 Jan 2021

As little as 9 months ago, Portugal was considered a model of success in the battle against COVID-19, particularly in comparison to neighbouring Spain.

But in early 2021, with the country's rate of new cases reaching the highest in the world in proportion to its population last week [week of 18 Jan 20201], and ambulances queueing outside Lisbon hospitals as its health service buckles under the strain, it is a grimly different story.

"The main hospitals are overcharged with sick people and doctors," Manuel Carvalho, the director of one of Portugal's biggest daily newspapers, Publico, told Al Jazeera. "It is increasingly impossible to take care of all people that ask for help. Things are really bad and there are no signs of improvement."

Record death tolls from the pandemic were set each day last week, rising steadily from 152 on [17 Jan 2021] to 275 on [24 Jan 2021], while on Saturday 15 000 new cases were registered in just 24 hours.

All of this is a far cry from early last year [2020], when Portugal was the last country in Europe to register a COVID-19 case, on [2 Mar 2020].

Having swiftly brought in confinement measures, until May [2020], while Spain's contagions marked Europe-wide highs, Portugal's total contagion figures were at times as little as 10 percent of its neighbour.

Record numbers of cases are currently being registered worldwide, and like so many other countries, Portugal is suffering from pandemic fatigue. Authorities are toughening up restrictions after estimating that just 30 percent of the population respects social distancing rules.

However, Francisco Miranda Rodrigues, the president of one of Portugal's top associations of mental health professionals, Ordem dos Psicologos Portugueses (OPP), said: "It's a complicated cocktail of causes, perhaps unique to Portugal.

"20 percent of our population lives in poverty or social exclusion, a very significant figure, and after such a long pandemic their limited resources have been used up. As a result, their ability to follow [the lockdown] rules has gone up in smoke."

Furthermore, compared with the government's clear instructions last year [2020], he believes some Portuguese people have been baffled by the authorities' much more mixed messages recently.

"At first it was easy to say 'stay home' to everybody, with no exceptions, and that was it. But when restrictions eased, we needed some higher-risk groups to return to work, so we had to tell them they could go back if they were careful," Miranda Rodrigues said.

"At the same time, when you're talking to teenagers you want them to be a little bit more afraid. [But] then you're telling the elderly to stay home, while others they can go to the cinema: it's confusing."

Another important factor, Miranda Rodrigues argues, is a chronic lack of psychological support networks within the public health system, with just 2.5 mental health professionals per 100 000 people. "When a tough situation goes on for months and months, more and more people are vulnerable," he argued.

"When the pandemic started, a special telephone hotline providing nationwide psychological help was created, running 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. "But that was to act as a quick fix, while more much structured psychological support programs were created. Unfortunately, that hasn't happened."

Viewed from the other side of the frontier, Guillermo Mart√≠nez de Tejada, professor of microbiology and parasitology at the University of Navarra in northern Spain, believes Portugal may have "lowered their guard" after such early success.

"That 1st victory probably made them too confident and the virus has ended up running wild. They ended up in a trap," Miranda Rodrigues said.

[MADS], a teacher and lifelong Lisbon resident, said: "Back in March [2020], people here were really scared, we didn't know what was happening. We could see the damage COVID-19 was causing close by, first in Italy and then even closer in Spain. So when the government said, "stay at home", people obeyed.

"But people are tired now. When the 2nd lockdown began, I went to the supermarket and it was like COVID didn't exist. It's as if the population didn't want to accept what's happening."

With roughly a quarter of her medical team now infected with COVID-19, she told Al Jazeera that the internal organisation is badly aggravating the situation, with pathologists, lab doctors, and psychologists being roped in to work in overwhelmed intensive care units rather than staff with more appropriate skills.

"We could have been much more prepared for this 2nd time. But there is no full emergency plan," she said.

On the political front, in Sunday's [24 Jan 2021] presidential elections, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa was re-elected with a hefty 60.7 percent of the vote.

The elections went ahead despite the pandemic, partly because any change of dates would have required overly complex legal alterations of the country's constitution.

However, a considerable increase in votes for the hard-right Chega Party, from 1.3 percent in the last general election to 11.9 percent on Sunday, was perhaps a warning sign that Portugal's population is deeply troubled by the nation's current predicament.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/1/26/doctors-forced-to-reject-patients-as-indonesia-passes-1m-cases


Dr Erlina Burhan has been providing medical care for more than 30 years -- but now, for the 1st time in her career, she has been forced to turn away patients.

For the past 6 months, the intensive care unit (ICU) at her hospital in Indonesia's capital, Jakarta, has been operating at between 90 to 100 percent capacity as coronavirus infections surge.

"We reject patients every day because there is nothing we can do if the hospital is full," said Burhan, the head of the COVID-19 team at the Persahabatan National Lung Hospital.

"Even if the patient is in a very bad condition and needs the ICU, if we have no space, we cannot take them and we have to say, [we're] sorry."

Indonesia's confirmed COVID-19 cases surpassed the one million mark on Tuesday [26 Jan 2021], but doctors are warning the reality in their hospitals is much worse -- particularly on the islands of Java and Bali. "There are some regions and cities with a bed occupancy rate of 90 percent -- and there are cities with 100 percent occupancy. The consequence of hospitals being overwhelmed is that patients won't get adequate treatment," said Hery Trianto, from the country's COVID-19 task force.

Dr Atok Irawan, from the Umum Sidoarjo Hospital in North Jakarta, said the facility has no choice but to use its general section to treat COVID-19 patients because the designated COVID-19 area is already at capacity.

"Last night we were really overwhelmed ... almost all the assigned COVID-19 hospitals are full," he said. "We have many non-COVID patients that need help too ... because of the rainy season, there are patients with typhoid and diarrhoea."

In East Jakarta, Burhan's hospital has been adding ventilators and beds in emergency units, but it does not have enough staff to keep up with the demand.

"We receive so many requests and sadly, we have to turn them down," Burhan said. "I read the files of people referred to our hospital. It makes me so sad ... A person who can hardly breathe ... but we can't help them."

To date, Indonesia has recorded some 28 500 coronavirus-related deaths while more than 800 000 people have recovered. Among them was [GL], who experienced body aches, eye pain, diarrhoea, fever, and difficulties breathing.

The Jakarta resident was fortunate to receive treatment at Wisma Atlet -- formerly, the Athlete's Village during the 2018 Asian Games but now, a fully functioning hospital for COVID-19 patients -- relatively quickly, but she found herself on a desperate search to secure medical care for her elderly parents after they also tested positive for the virus.

"My mother and father started having breathing problems and my dad was shivering and feeling weak," [GL] said. We went to an emergency unit and it was full ... there were many people on the waiting list," she said. "In another hospital, the emergency unit was already full. Eventually, her parents were hospitalised because a nearby hospital was able to increase its patient capacity, and they have since recovered.

"I was panicked. I have been watching the news and I saw that many health facilities are full. So I was scared," [GL] said.

Out of desperation, some families have turned to a local COVID-19 data agency to help them find a hospital that will accept their loved ones.

Since August last year [2020], Dr Irma Hidayana from Lapor COVID-19 has been fielding these calls. "From the cases, we are working on, 4 people died -- one died in a health centre, one died in a taxi after being rejected by so many hospitals ... another died in hospital because the ICU was full ... and [in] another case, the family had to rent a ventilator but that person died recently," she said.

The person who passed away in the taxi had tried to get treatment at 10 hospitals -- and after being rejected by all of them, died on the way to another one.

"Many sick people can't get treatment, they can't even get into the ICU," Hidayana said. "It's important for the government to fulfil the rights of the people to get medical treatment."

An archipelago of some 270 million people, Indonesia tests only about 40 000 to 50 000 people a day, with about 30 percent of those tested returning positive results.

It is the worst affected country in South East Asia but, unlike its neighbours, it has never implemented a strict COVID-19 lockdown.

Meanwhile, many restrictions imposed at the beginning of the pandemic have already been watered down, despite evidence the crisis is getting worse. Current curbs include slightly reduced hours for shopping centres and restaurants and entry restrictions for most foreigners.

This week, President Joko Widodo praised his country's handling of the pandemic. "It has caused health and economic crises. We are grateful that Indonesia is one of the countries that can control these crises well," he said in a briefing.

"The pandemic is still going on and we have to stay alert."

[Clearly, the health systems in many developed and developing countries have been overwhelmed by the burden of the COVID-19 cases during the 1st and subsequent waves. The concept of 'preparedness' has been highlighted clearly as an important component of the WHO's International Health Regulations(IHR). However, there is a global realization that the intended preparedness mechanisms do not work as intended when tested by public health emergencies... more work needed. - Mod.UBA]

[2] Vaccine updates
[A] Merck candidates
Date: Mon 25 Jan 2021

Merck is giving up on 2 potential COVID-19 vaccines following poor results in early-stage studies.

The drugmaker said on Monday [25 Jan 2021] that it will focus instead on studying 2 possible treatments for the virus that also have yet to be approved by regulators. The company said its potential vaccines were well tolerated by patients, but they generated an inferior immune system response compared with other vaccines.

Merck was developing one of the potential vaccines with France's Pasteur Institute based on an existing measles vaccine. The French institute said it will keep working on 2 other vaccine projects using different methods.

Merck entered the race to fight COVID-19 later than other top drugmakers.

It said last fall [2020] that it had started early-stage research in volunteers on potential vaccines that require only one dose. Vaccines developed by Pfizer and Moderna were already in late-stage research at that point.

The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allowed emergency use of both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines late last year [2020]. Each requires 2 shots.

Five potential vaccines have reached late-stage testing in the US, the final phase before a drugmaker seeks approval from regulators. Results from a single-dose candidate developed by Johnson & Johnson are expected soon.

Since vaccinations began in December [2020], nearly 22 million doses have been delivered to people nationwide, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nearly 6 percent of the population has received at least one dose.

A total of 3.2 million people, or one percent of the population, have received both doses required for those vaccines.

More than 419 000 people in the US and 2 million globally have died due to the coronavirus, according to Johns Hopkins University.

The government is paying Merck & Co about USD 356 million to fast-track production of one of its potential treatments under Operation Warp Speed, a push to develop COVID-19 vaccines and treatments. The money will allow the Kenilworth, New Jersey, company to deliver up to 100 000 doses by [30 Jun 2021], if the FDA clears the treatment for emergency use.

The treatment, known as MK-7110, has the potential to minimise the damaging effects of an overactive immune response to COVID-19. This immune response can complicate the life-saving efforts of doctors and nurses.

Merck said early results from a late-stage study of that drug showed a more than 50 percent reduction in the risk of death or respiratory failure in patients hospitalised with moderate or severe COVID-19. The company expects full results from that study in the first quarter of 2021.

Merck's other potential treatment is an oral antiviral drug. The company also expects to see early results from mid-to-late-stage research on that in the 1st quarter.

[The official statement from Merck indicates that the 2 vaccine candidates failed to generate immune responses comparable to a natural infection or existing vaccines in early trail data.

These 2 candidates were lagging behind the other competitors and led to the discontinuation of further development work. Merck had adopted a more traditional approach of focusing on shots based on weakened viruses. One, called V590, borrowed technology from Merck's Ebola inoculation, while the other, V591, is based on a measles vaccine used in Europe. - Mod.UBA]

[B] Moderna: booster shot for new virus variant B.1.351
Date: Mon 25 Jan 2021
Source: The Scientist [edited]
https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/moderna-developing-booster-shot-for-new-virus-variant-b-1-351-68384


Moderna announced today (January 25) plans for testing 2 different booster vaccines aimed at the SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.351, also known as 501Y.V2, that emerged in South Africa and has now spread to numerous countries.

"The virus is changing its stripes, and we will change to make sure we can beat the virus where it's going," Stephen Hoge, the president of Moderna, tells The Washington Post.

A study from Moderna posted to the preprint server bioRxiv today [see reference below] that has not yet been peer-reviewed reports that its vaccine produced neutralizing antibodies against several SARS-CoV-2 variants, including B.1.351 and B.1.1.7, the latter of which was first spotted in the UK and is rapidly becoming common in other countries. But antibody levels produced in response to B.1.351 were about 6 times lower than prior variants. Moderna's statement says that these antibody titers "remain above levels that are expected to be protective," but warns that "these lower titers may suggest a potential risk of earlier waning of immunity to the new B.1.351 strains."

The Moderna vaccine is currently administered as 2 doses spaced a month apart. According to the statement, the company will test whether a third shot of the current vaccine or a strain-specific booster shot will enhance immunity to B.1.351.

"Out of an abundance of caution and leveraging the flexibility of our mRNA platform, we are advancing an emerging variant booster candidate against the variant first identified in the Republic of South Africa into the clinic to determine if it will be more effective to boost titers against this and potentially future variants," says Stephane Bancel, the chief executive officer of Moderna, in the statement.

B.1.351, first detected in South Africa in October 2020, is one of a growing number of SARS-CoV-2 variants. This one is distinct from the highly transmissible B.1.1.7, although both versions have multiple mutations on the spike protein, which the virus uses to enter cells. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there is no evidence that B.1.135 causes more severe disease than other variants do.

[C] Moderna: vaccine use in pregnant women
Date: Tue 26 Jan 2021 20:06

After reviewing Moderna data, a World Health Organization (WHO) panel of experts on Tuesday [26 Jan 2021] stated that the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine should not be given to pregnant women unless they are health workers or have preexisting medical conditions putting them at high risk.

In addition, people with severe allergic reactions to any of the vaccine components should not be given the vaccine as well.

The WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization, known as SAGE, issued a series of recommendations on Moderna, several weeks after issuing their guidance on the rival Pfizer shot.

Regarding pregnant women's reactions to coronavirus vaccines in general, no research was published so far, whether for Moderna or Pfizer's vaccines.

WHO director of immunization Kate O'Brien said that clinical trials of the Moderna vaccine were needed on pregnant women.

"There is no reason to think there could be a problem in pregnancy, we are just acknowledging the data is not there at the moment," she said.

The WHO was liaising with Moderna on data it submitted as part of its application for WHO emergency use listing and would make a decision soon, she added.

In Israel, the Ministry of Health gave its approval last week [week of 18 Jan 2021] for pregnant women to receive the novel coronavirus vaccine.

According to the stance of the National Council for Women and the Health Ministry's committee for determining vaccination priority, women who are highly exposed to the public or who have preexisting medical conditions are encouraged to be vaccinated to prevent infection due to their likelihood of developing a serious case of COVID-19.

"There is a higher incidence of serious COVID-19 in pregnant women who become infected with coronavirus," the Health Ministry said in a statement. But the decision to vaccinate "is in the hands of the pregnant woman," it added.

Until now, neither the Health Ministry, the World Health Organization nor Pfizer -- the maker of the vaccine being used in Israel -- have recommended allowing pregnant women to be vaccinated because the company's clinical trials did not include them.

However, Pfizer had earlier published studies that did involve pregnant women who did not know they were pregnant when they received their vaccinations, and their pregnancies and births were normal.

Health Minister Yuli Edelstein told The Jerusalem Post, "We also, in the beginning, did not administer [the vaccine] to pregnant women, or those immediately after being pregnant, or even to those who were planning to be pregnant.

"Then, Pfizer came out with a different announcement. We turned to the Israeli Association of Gynecologists and asked for their professional opinion. They have given us their professional opinion that encourages young women to come and get the vaccine.

"I would say, not being a medical doctor, that when I look at these terrible cases of a number of pregnant women who are in serious condition with the coronavirus, I say to myself, probably it is worse to take the little risk of taking the vaccine instead of finding yourself in a terrible situation in the hospital."

Based on evidence from clinical trials, the Moderna vaccine was 94.1% effective at preventing laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 illness in people who received 2 doses and who had no evidence of being previously infected. The vaccine appeared to have high effectiveness in clinical trials (efficacy) among people of diverse age, sex, race, and ethnicity categories and among persons with underlying medical conditions. Although few people in the clinical trials were admitted to hospital, this happened less often in the people who got the Moderna vaccine compared to people who got the saline placebo (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/Moderna.html). - Mod.UBA]

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (149 625), Brazil (63 626), Spain (36 435), and France (22 086) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 17 573 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 25 Jan to late 26 Jan 2021).

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (12 countries) include the USA, Brazil, Spain, France, the UK (20 088), Russia (18 241), Colombia (13 606), Indonesia (13 094), India (12 569), Portugal (10 765), Italy (10 584), and Argentina (10 409). A total of 52 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 24 of the 51 countries that reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 14 are from the Americas region, 5 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 4 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 8.9%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 5.9%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the United States show a 16.3% decrease in daily reported cases and a 9.4% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported cases are over 500 000 newly confirmed infections daily in the past 24 hours and over 100.8 million cumulative reported cases with over 2.16 million reported deaths.
