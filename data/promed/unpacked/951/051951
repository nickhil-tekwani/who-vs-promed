Italy has suspended the use of 2 batches of a flu vaccine made by Swiss firm Novartis after 4 people died shortly after receiving the drug [vaccine]. Italy's pharmaceutical watchdog Aifa said the suspension of Fluad was a precautionary measure -- and tests were being conducted to establish whether there was a link. Those who died were 2 women and 2 men aged between 67 and 87.

Novartis said "no causal relationship to the vaccine has been established." Fluad is a flu vaccine given to the elderly, which was approved in 1997. In a statement, Aifa said: "At this point, it is not clear if there is a causal relationship or a link to the vaccination. A full picture will be formed only after a full analysis of all aspects, including the general health of the patients, their ages and probable conditions they might have had."

Novartis said it [the vaccine] had a "robust" safety history. A review of the 2 batches in question has "confirmed that they are in conformity with all production and quality standards," the company said. It added: "Patient safety is our 1st priority and we take these reports very seriously." Fluad has been tested in clinical trials with more than 70 000 patients, added Novartis, which said it was working closely with Aifa for further assessment. It added that Fluad had been used since 1997, during which time more than 65 million doses have been successfully administered around the world.

[In the absence of information on the medical histories of the 4 deceased patients, speculation is unwise. Regarding the vaccine: the company fact sheet states that Fluad is an influenza vaccine adjuvanted with MF59, a proprietary adjuvant. Fluad has been proven effective in inducing strong immune responses in older adults and young children. Due to the weakened or underdeveloped immune systems of older adults and young children, respectively, these groups face the highest risk for contracting seasonal influenza. These groups are also the most likely to suffer from serious consequences caused by infection, such as worsening chronic conditions, dehydration, hospitalisation and even death. Fluad was 1st approved in Europe in 1997 and has been shown to be effective in inducing protective immune responses in older adults and young children. This vaccine can also be useful for those with an increased risk of associated complications due to underlying chronic conditions, including diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and respiratory infections.

Fluad is the only MF59-adjuvanted seasonal influenza vaccine. It is indicated for active immunization against influenza in individuals ages 65 and older and is currently licensed in 35 countries across the European Union, Latin America, Asia Pacific and Canada. Fluad is not licensed for use in children. Submissions for marketing approval of Fluad in children are ongoing in Canada, Argentina and Brazil. Fluad is registered under different brand names by Novartis Vaccines, including Gripguard in France and Chiromas in Spain.

The Lombardia Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness (LIVE) study was a large-scale, phase III study conducted in Italy during the 2006-7, 2007-8 and 2008-9 influenza seasons to compare the efficacy and safety of Fluad (MF59-adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine, aTIV) to non-adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV). Results found that Fluad reduced the risk of hospitalizations caused by influenza or pneumonia by 23 percent in older adults compared to non-adjuvanted vaccine. - Mod.CP
