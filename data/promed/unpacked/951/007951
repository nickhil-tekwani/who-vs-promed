[1] Cholera - Malawi (Southern Region)

Inter Press Service reports on a cholera outbreak in Malawi's Nsanje and Chikhwawa districts, located on the southern border with Mozambique, noting that government officials have attributed the outbreak to declining sanitation conditions as a result of flooding in late January 2012.

According to IPS: "Up to 550 pit latrines were washed away in Nsanje alone, a district hardest hit by the floods, ... and sewage from the latrines has contaminated water sources in the district, including boreholes and dug-out wells, thereby escalating the cholera incidents, according to the assistant disaster management officer for Nsanje, Humphrey Magalasi."

In addition, the news service notes that camps for those displaced by the flooding "are now congested, and the survivors are living in unhygienic conditions." According to IPS: "There were a few incidents of flooding in Nsanje and Chikhwawa during the rainy season last year [2011], and the entire country recorded 76 cholera cases only."

The news service added: "District commissioner for Nsanje Rodney Simwaka told IPS that government has been building the capacity of villagers in flood preparedness for the past 3 years since the area is flood prone."

A cholera epidemic which was reported early in February 2012 in the village of Muanda, which is situated in Bas-Congo province, south west of Kinshasa, has left at least 4 people dead, a source from DR Congo's National Institute for Biomedical Research (INRB) said on Mon 6 Feb 2012.

Epidemiology experts from INRB said that the cholera epidemic had equally affected the Kitona military base, which is not far away from Muanda.

"We appeal to the people not to panic but to maintain proper hygiene conditions, especially by avoiding contact with people who have been contaminated, to boil drinking water, and to properly cook food," the Muanda zone chief medical officer Dr Jean Miambi said. He added that it was important for the people to properly wash their hands after going to the toilet.

Between October and December last year [2011], 42 people died during a cholera outbreak in Equator province and Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).
