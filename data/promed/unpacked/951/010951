BSE, GOAT - UK 1990 (02): SUSPECTED

Due to an editing error, an incorrect statement was included in the
last sentence of the moderator's comment of "BSE, goat - UK 1990:
susp." 20050208.0434. The final paragraph of the moderators comment
should have read:
"The TSE positivity ratio (positives per 10 000 tested) of healthy
goats in the EU15 during 2003 was 4.7. It was 52.4 in the UK,
compared to 14.0 in Greece (2nd to UK) and 3.6 in France. While this
might reflect the high scrapie incidence in British sheep, it is also
true that more testing for BSE in small ruminants is needed."
