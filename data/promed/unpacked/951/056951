The FDA is working with federal, state, and local officials regarding a _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ outbreak linked to fresh crab meat from Venezuela. Louisiana is 1 of 3 states where the outbreak has been reported.

The FDA is advising consumers to avoid eating fresh crab meat from Venezuela, as it may be contaminated with _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_. Consumers are urged to ask where their crab meat is from if dining out at a restaurant or purchasing from grocery stores. The product is commonly found in plastic tubs and may be labeled as "pre-cooked." Retailers should not serve or sell fresh crab meat imported from Venezuela.

As of [Thu 12 Jul 2018], there are 12 cases of _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ infection. The states reporting cases associated with this outbreak include Maryland (8), Louisiana (2), Pennsylvania (1), and the District of Columbia (1). Four of these cases are confirmed matches to the outbreak strain by Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE), which is a type of DNA fingerprinting. All 4 of these confirmed cases are in Maryland. Four people have been hospitalized. Illnesses started on dates ranging from [Sun 1 Apr 2018-Tue 3 Jul 2018].

Food contaminated with Vibrio parahaemolyticus may look, smell, and taste normal. Most people infected with _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ develop diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, nausea, fever, and stomach pain. Diarrhea tends to be watery and occasionally bloody. Most people infected with _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ develop symptoms after approximately 24 hours, but timing can vary.

Anyone who consumes raw or undercooked shellfish is at risk of contracting _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_. However, the product currently under investigation is a fresh, pre-cooked product that may be served chilled or lightly re-heated in various dishes. Children younger than 5, the elderly, and those people with weakened immune systems are more likely to have severe infections.

[Unless the contaminated crab meat was eaten raw, the illnesses were acquired from either undercooking or poor kitchen hygiene with cross-contamination.

The following is from the CDC regarding _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_:

_V. parahaemolyticus_ is a bacterium in the same family as those that cause cholera. It lives in brackish saltwater and causes gastrointestinal illness in humans. _V. parahaemolyticus_ naturally inhabits coastal waters and is present in higher concentrations during summer; it is a halophilic, or salt-requiring, organism.

When ingested, _V. parahaemolyticus_ causes watery diarrhea, often with abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, fever, and chills. Usually these symptoms occur within 24 hours of ingestion. Illness is usually self-limited and lasts 3 days. Severe disease is rare and occurs more commonly in persons with weakened immune systems. _V. parahaemolyticus_ can also cause an infection of the skin when an open wound is exposed to warm seawater.

Most people become infected by eating raw or undercooked shellfish, particularly oysters. Less commonly, this organism can cause an infection in the skin when an open wound is exposed to warm seawater.

An estimated 4500 cases of _V. parahaemolyticus_ infection occur each year in the USA. However, the number of cases reported to CDC is much lower, because surveillance is complicated by underreporting. Laboratories rarely use the selective medium that is necessary to identify this organism, and it is likely that many cases are undetected. To improve our ability to monitor trends, infections caused by _V. parahaemolyticus_ and other _Vibrio_ species became nationally notifiable in 2007. State health departments report cases to CDC, and these reports are summarized annually.

_Vibrio_ organisms can be isolated from cultures of stool, wound, or blood. For isolation from stool, use of a selective medium that has thiosulfate, citrate, bile salts, and sucrose (TCBS agar) is recommended. If there is clinical suspicion for infection with this organism, the microbiology laboratory should be notified so that they will perform cultures using this medium. A physician should suspect _V. parahaemolyticus_ infection if a patient has watery diarrhea and has eaten raw or undercooked seafood, especially oysters, or when a wound infection occurs after exposure to seawater.

Treatment is not necessary in most cases of _V. parahaemolyticus_ infection. There is no evidence that antibiotic treatment decreases the severity or the length of the illness. Patients should drink plenty of liquids to replace fluids lost through diarrhea. In severe or prolonged illnesses, antibiotics such as tetracycline or ciprofloxacin can be used. The choice of antibiotics should be based on antimicrobial susceptibilities of the organism.

_Vibrio_ is a naturally occurring organism commonly found in waters where oysters are cultivated. When the appropriate conditions occur with regard to salt content and temperature, _V. parahaemolyticus_ thrives.

Most infections caused by _V. parahaemolyticus_ in the USA can be prevented by thoroughly cooking seafood, especially oysters. Wound infections can be prevented by avoiding exposure of open wounds to warm seawater. When an outbreak is traced to an oyster bed, health officials recommend closing the oyster bed until conditions are less favorable for _V. parahaemolyticus_. - Mod.LL
