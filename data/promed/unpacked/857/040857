Bird tests positive in 1st EEE case
-----------------------------------
A dead bird found off Sunden Parkway tested positive for eastern equine
encephalitis (EEE), marking the 1st documented case of the potentially
deadly disease in town.
The town sent 3 birds to the state laboratory in Concord last week [3rd
week September 2005], according to Officer Tona McCarthy. One wren came
back positive for EEE, and 2 blue jays tested positive for the West Nile virus.
The positive tests come in the wake of the death of a 20 year old from
Newton, who contracted EEE and subsequently died from the virus on 9 Sep
2005. Health officer Richard Mailhot said the positive test for EEE was the
1st in Raymond. There are a substantial amount of wetlands and mosquito
activity in town, he said, but the spread of the virus depends highly on
the migratory patterns of birds.
Raymond does not spray for mosquitoes. Towns that have had dead birds with
EEE and West Nile in recent years, such as Newton and Kingston, hire
companies in the spring to kill the mosquito larvae in mosquito habitats.
Both towns are scheduled to disperse an aerosol spray that kills adult
mosquitoes.
While spraying does diminish the number of mosquitoes, there is no way to
get rid of all of them, which is why state officials have asked residents
to take proper precautions to avoid being bitten. Mailhot said he is
recommending residents limit early-morning and late-evening outdoor
activities, use insect repellent that contains DEET, and wear long sleeves
and pants when possible.
"In general, mosquito bites are something to be avoided whenever possible,"
said Mailhot. "We just need to be more vigilant in how we protect
ourselves." McCarthy said he's seen an influx of calls to pick up dead
birds since the woman's death, which he said made the community more aware
of the risk in contracting EEE.
"Since the incident with my fellow officer, I think people are being more
cautious," said McCarthy, adding that no more birds will be accepted,
because both viruses are confirmed. "Now that Raymond tested positive, it's
here."
There are 5 confirmed human cases of EEE in the state this year [2005]. One
has resulted in a death, but state officials said there is a 35 percent
chance of death once the virus is contracted. The death of the woman was
the 1st in the state in 25 years.
EEE is spread to humans by the bite of an infected mosquito. When a
mosquito bites an infected bird, it becomes infected. The infected mosquito
could then bite a human and transmit the infection.
Though horses are most susceptible to contracting the virus, neither horses
nor humans can transmit the virus to mosquitoes or other animals. EEE is
mainly transmitted between birds and certain types of mosquitoes.
Symptoms range from mild flu-like illness to inflammation of the brain,
coma or death, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC). State officials said mosquito activity will decrease as the weather
gets cooler and should be negligible once the 1st frost comes, likely
sometime in October.
"Fall is approaching soon, but this is no time to drop our guard," said
John Stephen, commissioner of the state Department of Health and Human
Services (DHHS). "We continue to see substantial evidence that both EEE and
West Nile virus are actively present in New Hampshire. I hope everyone
continues to take preventive measures to protect themselves from these
diseases."
DHHS has set up a toll-free hotline for EEE/West Nile virus at (866)
273-6453. Anyone with questions can call from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. for
information about these viruses. For information go to the CDC website
<http://www.cdc.gov>, or the DHHS website <http://www.dhhs.nh.gov>.
