The increasing number of children diagnosed with foot-hand-mouth
disease indicates the epidemic is entering a new phase, said doctors
at the Infectious Disease Department of Pediatrics Hospital No 1, HCM
City.

Yesterday [20 Apr 2008] morning alone, the department received 52
children suffering from the disease, which is highly infectious.

The disease can lead to inflamed sores on the lips, tongue and mouth,
fever, sore throat and tender hands and feet. Children are generally
more affected.

"The number of patients this week doubled over last week," said
Truong Huu Khanh, head of the department.

An increase in victims was also reported at Pediatrics Hospital
No 2. About 30 patients a day are being admitted.

It said cases in the 1st 3 months of this year [2008] were 7 times
higher than for the same period last year [2007].

"These figures show that the risk of a serious epidemic is very
high," said one doctor. Most children are admitted with long lasting
fever, nausea and vomiting. Their hands, feet and mouth are often
covered with pus-filled blisters.

"Convulsion, waking up with a start or with glowing [sic] eyes are other
symptoms," said Dr Khanh.

The disease is easily treated, but if left alone can damage the brain
and heart. Death sometime occurs.

"Children under 3 years of age can get the disease through touching
nose fluids, spittle or touching bottles, food or toys belonging to
those already suffering," said Khanh.

To prevent the disease, parents should take note of any symptoms and
take their children to hospital for diagnosis and treatment if they
persist, said Khanh.

[This is the 1st outbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD)
reported in Viet Nam in 2008. The etiological agent and detailed
clinical manifestation of the cases are not described in the above
newswire. As there are no fatalities reported at present, it is
likely that coxsackievirus is responsible for this outbreak.

As mentioned in prior PRO/MBDS postings, HFMD can be caused by
several viruses, the most frequent of which are coxsackievirus A16
and enterovirus 71. HFMD caused by coxsackievirus A16 infection tends
to be a mild disease, with most patients recovering within 7 to 10
days without medical treatment. On rare occasions, a patient with
coxsackievirus A16 infection may also develop a viral meningitis
leading to a short hospitalization. Infection with enterovirus 71 may
also cause viral meningitis and, rarely, more serious manifestations,
such as encephalitis, or a poliomyelitis-like paralytic disease. The
encephalitis associated with enterovirus 71 infection may be fatal,
such as that seen during outbreaks of HFMD in Malaysia in 1997 and in
Taiwan in 1998.

There were 2 prior reports of outbreaks of HFMD in Ho Chi Minh city
during 2007. The 1st outbreak was reported in April 2007, and the 2nd
outbreak was in September 2007 (see prior PRO/MBDS postings listed
below).

More information from reliable sources on the etiological agent and
results of epidemiologic studies on the current outbreak of HFMD in
Viet Nam would be greatly appreciated.
