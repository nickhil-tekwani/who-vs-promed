A white-tailed deer with respiratory difficulty was euthanized in
Rock Creek Park in the District of Columbia on 21 Sep 2007. Necropsy
findings included pleural effusion and marked pulmonary edema with
hemorrhage in the tracheal mucosa. Further testing was positive for
epizootic hemorrhagic disease by PCR. Further typing of the virus is
currently underway. Per the DC Department of Health, 5 other suspect
cases of EHD in white-tailed deer were identified within the district
lines near this time period. Further information can be found at

[We appreciate Dr. Viner's firsthand report from the District of
Columbia. It certainly did not seem to catch the eye of the local and
vocal news agencies in the area. With EHD practically surrounding the
district, it is not unexpected. Hopefully, Dr. Viner will let us know
what type of EHD the cervids had. - Mod.TG]
