Pollution afflicts Thai farmers. Toxic cadmium poisoning symptoms similar
to 'itai itai' disease
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Farmers in a cadmium-polluted village in northern Thailand have been
complaining of symptoms similar to Japan's 'itai itai' disease, a type of
cadmium poisoning, and one of the 4 major pollution-related diseases in Japan.

In mid-January [2009], a group of 1128 Thai farmers filed a damages suit
against a local zinc-mining operator and a mine development firm, demanding
3.7 billion baht (USD 105 million) in compensation. But the farmers are in
a quandary, as the legal battle is expected to be lengthy before any
settlement.

In the Mae Ku district in the suburbs of Mae Sot, [Tak province in north
western Thailand], former rice paddies stretching over a gently sloping
hilly area are now covered with weeds, exposing cracks on the dry surface.
"Only black rice grows here," said [a farmer], 68, as she stood and looked
at the tainted paddies. Having devoted herself to rice cultivation for the
past 4 decades, [she] was proud of her rice crop, which once won an award
at an agricultural fair. However, the rice in her paddies began turning
dark around 2000.

The nonprofit International Water Management Institute (IWMI) concluded in
2004 that pollution of accumulated cadmium had changed the color of the
rice in the area. Upon the discovery, the Thai government banned farmers in
the polluted area from cultivating rice.

So [the farmer] began growing corn for fuel use and other vegetables in
place of rice, but in vain. "They didn't grow well, so I couldn't make
enough money," she said. That calamity was followed by [her] own health
problems. "Recently, I've been troubled with persistent pain, as if the
bones in my arm are squeaking," she said, adding that calcium prescribed by
her doctor was not helping. Her husband, 70, has been bedridden for 2
years. She heard a rumor that 40 people had died in connection with the
tainted "black rice". "I was told my symptoms are similar to those of
Japan's 'itai itai' disease sufferers, whose bones turned fragile. I don't
want to die," she said, as tears welled in her eyes.

The IWMI survey showed that about 2000 hectares [4940 acres] in the Mae Ku
area and its vicinity had been polluted with cadmium. The amount of cadmium
detected in the tainted rice was more than 5 times the internationally
permissible level of 0.4 milligrams per kilogram.

Though the Thai government purchased polluted rice between 2004 and 2007,
it failed to take any measures to compensate for the farmers' financial
losses. Moreover, the source of the contamination has yet to be determined.
A separate survey by Mae Sot General Hospital and other groups found that
about 7000 residents in the Mae Ku region and its vicinity have complained
of pains in their bones and of kidney disorders -- symptoms believed to be
caused by cadmium intake.

Although examinations by Japanese doctors and other experts showed that the
patients' symptoms at this stage were not as critical as those of 'itai
itai' disease sufferers, a local doctor expressed concern. "High levels of
cadmium have accumulated in the bodies of many elderly patients. We should
take careful note of the situation," said Pisit Limpatanachote, a doctor at
Mae Sot General Hospital, adding that sufficient steps to address the
situation have yet to be taken.

Farmers suspect the zinc-mining firm had released cadmium-contaminated
waste water into the river during the refining process. "I've lost my job,
become sick, and haven't received compensation. I can't stand this
situation any longer," said [an individual] who represents the plaintiffs.
But resolving the dispute likely will take some time, as the company is set
to contest its responsibility for the cadmium contamination. "We believe
the company has met required environmental standards," said a company
official in charge of general affairs.

[The disease referred to 'itai-itai' literally translates to 'ouch-ouch'
disease. The disease is characterized by osteomalacia accompanied with
osteoporosis, and multiple proximal renal tubular dysfunctions. Cadmium
causes a syndrome described as softening of the bones, and it affects all
bones and joints, including those of the spine. The bone pain and the
kidney pain of those suffering from the disease gave rise to the name of
the disease.

In addition, victims of cadmium intoxication generally suffer with dry
throat, cough, headache, vomiting, chest pain, congestive lung conditions,
pulmonary edema, bronchospasm, wheezing, pneumonitis, muscle weakness, and
severe leg pain.

The situation for those suffering from cadmium disease is sad and made more
unfortunate by the inability to discover the source and for the people to
receive some type of compensation in order to live.

Supportive care is about the best treatment. EDTA has been added to
hemodialysis and has had some positive effect. - Mod.TG
