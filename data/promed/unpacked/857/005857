I'd like to add a clinical note to this observation.
In 1984, I was a staff physician at a multispecialty clinic in a Big 10
city with a large veterinary school. One night, one the veterinary
residents (specializing in veterinary gastroenterology) was admitted to my
service with a serious urinary tract infection. Although, the microscopic
appearance of the organism was clearly consistent with _E. coli_, the
infection did not respond to the usual antibiotic regimen for that
organism. Seventy-two hours later the lab confirmed the diagnosis of _E.
coli_, but also demonstrated resistance to almost all the then conventional
antibiotics, most of which were in routine prophylactic use among the large
animals of the resident's veterinary practice.
We assumed 14 years ago that the resident had acquired the resistant
organism from a veterinary "patient". I'm a little surprised to see this
phenomenon, which seemed to us an obvious consequence of the indiscriminate
use of antibiotics in agricultural practice, published as "news" in 1998.

[Approximately 8 years ago I assigned a group of Microbiology graduate
students to take an objective look at the published evidence for a direct
relationship between agricultural uses of antibiotics and the incidence of
infections in humans that were caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
Together we found very little that could be called "convincing data." We
came away from the project wondering if there was really anything to be
concerned about. The literature is starting to look a bit different now,
but there is still more heat than light. - Mod.ES
