According to surveillance data, 329 802 people had sustained tick bites up
to 17:00 hr on Wed 8 Aug 2007, including 76 242 children. All patients were
treated in the health care facilities of 67 of the administrative units of
the Russian Federation.
[The Russian Federation comprises 48 Oblasts, 21 Republics, 7 Krais, 2
Federal Cities and one Autonomous Oblast. A comprehensive description of
the complicated administrative structure of contemporary Russia, together
with maps, is available at

The highest numbers have been recorded in the Sverdlovsk Region -- 27 372
cases, the Kemerovo Region -- 27 218, the Perm Krai -- 21 281, the
Novosibirsk Region -- 18 681, the Krasnoyarsk Krai -- 17 262, the

The coverage for seroprophylaxis in the Kemerovo, Novosibirsk and Tyumen
Regions and the Krasnoyarsk Krai was 90 per cent of those who sought
treatment, but the coverage for vaccination was only 2 to 9 per cent of
those who applied.
By 6 Aug 2007, 2124 cases of [suspected] tickborne encephalitis (TBE) had
been recorded; of those, 1588 have been confirmed now by laboratory
diagnosis. The corresponding figures for 2006 were 1661 and 934,
respectively. The largest numbers of cases (laboratory confirmed in
brackets) have been recorded in the Krasnoyarsk Krai -- 325 (180), the
Altay Krai -- 118 (43), the Novosibirsk Region -- 127 (127), the Perm Krai
- 106 (78), the Sverdlovsk Region -- 118 (118), the Tomsk Region -- 92
(89), the Archangelsk Region -- 88 (43), the Kirovskaya Region -- 78 (68),
the Kemerovo Region -- 99 (96), the Tyumen Region -- 62 (35), and the
Republic of Altay -- 56 (46).
Out of 33 fatal cases 7 occurred in the Novosibirsk Region (including a
child), 5 in Primorskiy Krai, 5 in Krasnoyars Krai, 2 in the Omsk Region, 3
in Archangelsk Region, 2 in Chita Region, 2 in Kemerovo Region, one in the
Sverdlovsk Region, one in Perm Krai, one in the Tomsk Region, one in the
Kurgan Region, one in the Khabarovsk Region, one in Irkutsk Region, and one
in Republic of Buryatia.
Tick control measures have involved about 33691 hectares of land in the
following territories, where the land area treated was less than in the
previous year -- 2006 figures in parenthesis; Chleyabinsk region -- 2815
(8306), Sverdlovsk region -- 3461 (4979), Promorskiy kray -- 230 (307). On
the other hand, tick control measures have been enhanced in the following
territories: 834 hectares in Krasnoyarsk Kray (552 in 2006), 631 in
Kemerovo Region (489), 2219 in Novosibirsk Region (778), 717 in Tomsk
Region (342), 539 in Republic of Karelia (339), 782 in Kirov Region (492),
380 in Republic of Khakasia (221), 2064 in Republic of Udmurtia (1586), and
2158 in Perm kray (494).

[The overall situation regarding TBE morbidity is unsatisfactory. There has
been an increase in numbers of suspected cases by 27 per cent compared with
2006, and by 70 per cent in laboratory confirmed cases. The low level of
vaccination offered to patients seeking treatment is a cause for concern in
relation to the number receiving seroprophylaxis. Another cause for concern
is the reduction in tick control measures in some regions. - Mod.NP]
