Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ O26 Infections Associated with Torero's Mexican Restaurant in Renton, Washington
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At-A-Glance
-----------
Cases: 3
Hospitalizations: 0
Deaths: 0
Status: Investigation is in progress
Location: Torero's Mexican Restaurant, 920 N 10th St, Renton, WA 98057

Range of dates reported to Public Health: 8-16 Sep 2022
Prior food safety inspections and current rating: GOOD

Summary
-------
Public Health is investigating an outbreak of Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ (also known as enterohemorrhagic _E coli_, EHEC) associated with diarrhea and abdominal pain at Torero's Mexican Restaurant in Renton.

The investigation is ongoing. At this time, we have not identified how EHEC was spread within the restaurant. This is not uncommon for EHEC outbreaks, because the bacteria can spread through contaminated food items, environmental surfaces, and from person to person.

Illnesses
---------
Since 5 Sep 2022, 3 people from 3 separate meal parties reported becoming ill after eating food from Torero's Mexican Restaurant in Renton on 3 Sep 2022 and 7 Sep 2022. All of the people developed 1 or more symptoms consistent with EHEC, including diarrhea (often bloody), abdominal cramping, nausea, and vomiting. We have not identified any ill employees.

Public Health actions
---------------------
Public Health conducted interviews with the people ill with EHEC to identify potential common exposures. On 29 Sep 2022, Public Health identified Torero's as a common food source for all 3 individuals.

Environmental Health Investigators visited the restaurant on 30 Sep 2022. Investigators identified inadequate handwashing facilities and improper storage of raw meats as potential risk factors for this outbreak. All critical violations were corrected during the inspection. Environmental Health Investigators will revisit the facility within 2 weeks to ensure proper compliance with food handling practices.

No ill employees were identified at the time of the inspection. Investigators reviewed with restaurant management the requirement that ill staff are not allowed to work until they are symptom-free for at least 24 hours. Investigators provided education about preventing the spread of EHEC -- including proper handwashing, preventing bare hand contact with ready-to-eat foods, and preventing cross contamination during food preparation.

Laboratory testing
------------------
All of the cases have confirmatory testing indicating infections with Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ (EHEC) via culture. All confirmed cases have the same strain of STEC, based on genetic fingerprinting (whole genome sequencing or WGS) at the Washington State Public Health Laboratory.

[The reservoir for transmission of the serotype O26 EHEC strain is yet unknown. Foods commonly associated with outbreaks include undercooked meat and produce and the contamination can occur anytime from the field to the kitchen. Food can be contaminated in the restaurant by food workers practicing poor hygiene or from inadequate kitchen procedures. - Mod.LL
