Since 18 Sep 2010, at least 80 deer in Salem County have died from a
disease common in the South, 78 of them in Pennsville Township alone,
according to the state Division of Fish & Wildlife.

Fish & Wildlife pathologist Dr Douglas Roscoe, who runs the
division's Office of Health and Forensics, said the deaths are being
caused by the type 2 strain of epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD)
[virus].

Roscoe said the 80 deaths in Salem County have apparently resulted
from an EHD outbreak, which was confirmed by testing, between 18 Sep
and 15 Oct 2010.

According to Roscoe, the only reports of type 2 EHD in New Jersey so
far this year [2010] have come from Salem County. In Pennsville, 78
dead deer were found, with 2 other cases reported in Alloway and
Pittsgrove townships.

The spread of the disease is being traced to a key type of insect.
"From the people at the locations where the dead deer were reported,
it's apparent that they have an abundant midge population," said
Roscoe. "And biting midges are the factor for virus transmittal."

[A 30-year hunter and Pennsville resident], said midges are insects
that bite deer and transmit EHD. For the hunter, who hunts bow,
muzzle, and shotgun, midges have already dealt a blow to the deer
hunting season. The last time EHD hit the area, he said, was in 2007,
which Roscoe confirmed.

"In 2007 and now, in 2010, the EHD has hit Pennsville's deer
population hard," said the hunter. "After the 2007 outbreak killed
off the deer, a 3-year period passed, and us hunters thought this
current deer season would be the 1st year we'd see the deer
population recoup. And then this outbreak hit."

Roscoe said that the 2007 and 2010 EHD incidents both share one
common bond, they both involve type 2 strain of the virus.

"The 1st EHD outbreak reported in the entire United States was in
Morris County in New Jersey in 1955, and involved type 1 of the
virus," said Roscoe. "Type 1 came back to New Jersey in 1975, and
again, in Salem and Southern Gloucester County, in 1999."

But the 1st report of type 2 EHD came just 3 years ago, in 2007, said Roscoe.

"Type 2 is a strain typically found in the southern United States,"
said Roscoe. "Our hypothesis is, when type 2 first appeared in 2007,
a storm in the southern part of the United States came up north, and
heavy rains (helped to spread the disease) in New Jersey, Ohio, and
in the Hudson River Valley. Subsequently came reports of type 2 EHD."

Roscoe said type 2 EHD is recurrent in Southern states and it happens
in the South each fall. "EHD Type 2 is something that might be
recurrent, but we don't know that for certain yet," he said in terms
of New Jersey.

Area hunters may know EHD by another name -- bluetongue disease.
[However, there is a disease known as bluetongue disease (BT), and it
is closely related, but the 2 diseases are not the same. Often EHD
can spill into cattle and less frequently BT virus may spill into
cervids. But they are not the same disease. - Mod.TG]

"The blue tongue is a clinical sign of EHD that doesn't always show
up," said Roscoe. "But mid-October of this year [2010], a buck with a
blue tongue was found dead at a farm at the junction of (Route) 581
and Watsonville Road in Alloway Township."

While EHD is proving detrimental for this year's [2010] hunting
season, it won't prove detrimental to humans.

"The basic rule is, you don't want to eat any deer which looks sick.
Rule number 2 is to make sure you cook things properly," said Roscoe.
"But rule number 3 is that the EHD virus is not transmissible to
humans. It does cause some transient and mild occurrences in
livestock, but nothing on the order of the way it impacts deer.
Livestock wouldn't die, but we have gotten reports of livestock
having some temporary lameness, but it's a very transient thing."

For the hunter, who's hunted in Pennsville's Deer Management Zone 63
most of his hunting career, Pennsville's deer have had it hard enough
with this year's [2010] type 2 EHD outbreak. He and around 12 hunters
he's friends with have decided to leave deer alone for the season.
"We're just not hunting in Pennsville this year, we're going to hunt
elsewhere," he said. "Pretty much going to take the season off in
Pennsville, and we hope it'll catch on with other hunters so the deer
population can recoup."

While local hunters may be taking action, Roscoe said the Division of
Fish and Wildlife hasn't chosen to restrict hunting on Zone 63.

The Division of Fish and Wildlife's website says Zone 63 begins in
Deepwater, where the Salem Canal and Delaware River intersect. It
continues, touching on Alloways Creek, Finn's Point, and Fort Mott,
through the former Killcohook National Wildlife Refuge and returns to
the point where it began, at the Salem Canal and Delaware River's
intersection.

Roscoe said the 1999 EHD outbreak diminished 38 percent of the buck
harvest at various deer management units, and there was no adjustment
in the season and deer rebounded the next year.

Regardless of the current outbreak, Roscoe is hopeful that this year
[2010] death rates have already seen their peak. "Things will
probably get better for hunters later in the season, as the midges
become inactive with the onset of winter," he said. "They won't be
transmitting the disease much after this month."

[The weather has a limiting factor on the insects, especially the
biting midges _Culicoides_ that carry the disease. As the weather
becomes colder they should die out, and the cycle of the disease
seems to die out as well. It is getting pretty cool up in the
Northeastern US, but without a hard killing frost these insects will
continue to spread their disease.

Since it is hunting season, there are more people out to observe the
movement of the cervids, and consequently, more affected animals may
be seen than if the deaths had occurred in June. - Mod.TG]
