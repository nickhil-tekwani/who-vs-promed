An outbreak of tuberculosis among UK cat owners may have originated from a batch of infected venison given to felines as part of a trendy raw meat diet.

Experts led from Edinburgh investigated after 47 cats presented with suspected or definite infection with _Mycobacterium bovis_, the bacteria responsible for bovine TB.

Among the cats, _M. bovis_ was found to have caused skin lesions, swollen lymph nodes, respiratory problems, lethargy, lost appetite, and weight loss.

The team found that 83 additional cats had contracted the disease yet had no symptoms. While _M. bovis_ is usually caught from cattle, most of the pets lived indoors.

The common factor between the infected cats was found to be a diet including venison from Natural Instinct, a pet food company that specialises in raw food.

The infected meat -- traced back to a single supplier -- was withdrawn from shelves when the outbreak occurred. Natural Instinct has not sold raw venison since.

An outbreak of tuberculosis among UK cat owners may have originated from a batch of infected venison given to felines as part of a trendy raw meat diet.

Latent tuberculosis infection was found in 4 of the animal's owners and a veterinarian, with one owner having required treatment to address the infection.

The researchers have suggested that the human cases could represent "zoonotic transmission from these cats," or infection from handling the contaminated food. They cautioned, however, that it was also possible that the signs of latent TB came from a previous infection only identified as a result of the investigation.

The findings have added to the controversy around raw pet food, which is often recommended as being natural but can often contain dangerous pathogens.

The study was conducted by veterinary medicine expert Conor O'Halloran of the University of Edinburgh and his colleagues.

"Our results provide compelling evidence that the commercial raw diet of these cats was the likely route of infection in this outbreak of cases," the researchers wrote. "Investigations revealed affected cats were mainly indoor only and had been fed the same commercial raw food as at least part of their diet. This diet was recalled by the manufacturer due to failure of statutory meat inspection of the component venison."

"Everything we do at Natural Instinct is done so with the best interests of our customers and their pets in mind," a spokesperson for the Surrey-based raw pet food vendor told MailOnline.

"Natural Instinct has not manufactured any venison product (wild or farmed) for nearly 2 years and have not sold the product since 7 Dec 2018. Having been informed by the Food Standards Agency that a supplier had not followed EU inspection protocols, the product was then the subject of a comprehensive product recall. The study carried out by the University of Edinburgh, and published earlier this month [December 2020], found no signs of TB contamination in any of the Natural Instinct food tested, and there is, therefore, no reason to suggest this is the case."

There had previously only been 6 documented cases of humans catching tuberculosis from their feline friends, and Public Health England has reported that the risk of transmission from cats to humans is low.

It is estimated that the market in the UK for raw cat food products is worth some BP 91 million (USD 121 million).

The findings of the present study come after a 2018 paper found that raw pet food can harbour bacteria and parasites that pose a risk to animal and human health.

Researchers from Utrecht University and the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment in the Netherlands tested 35 commercial raw pet food products. They found _E. coli_ in 80 per cent of products tested, while _Listeria monocytogenes_ was detected in 54 per cent, and 20 per cent contained _Salmonella_. Four of the products contained the parasite _Sarcocystis cruzi_, while another 4 contained _Sarcocystis tenella_. _Toxoplasma gondii_ was found in 2 of the foods.

The full findings of the study were published in the journal Transboundary and Emerging Diseases [for link, see commentary below].

Its abstract follows:
"_Mycobacterium (M.) bovis_ can infect cats and is a demonstrated zoonosis. We describe an outbreak of _M. bovis_ in pet cats across England and Scotland associated with feeding a commercial raw food diet. 47 cats presented with (pyo)granulomatous lesions, lymphadenopathy, pulmonary and/or alimentary disease over a one-year period where _M. bovis_ infection was suspected or definitively diagnosed, and the cats all consumed the same specific brand of commercial raw venison pet food. Infection with _M. bovis_ genotype 10:a was confirmed by culture and DNA typing of isolates in a small number of cases (n=5); PCR was used in combination with or as an alternative to culture (n=12), and/or infection with a _Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex_ group organism was strongly suggested by positive responses to an interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA; n=34). Asymptomatic, at-risk cats were screened by IGRA, identifying a further 83 infected cats.

"The 5 culture-positive cases were distributed across areas of England and Scotland at low risk of endemic bovine tuberculosis.

"Investigations revealed affected cats were mainly indoor only and had been fed the same commercial raw food as at least part of their diet. This diet was recalled by the manufacturer due to failure of statutory meat inspection of the component venison.

"As far as possible, other sources of infection were explored and excluded, including wildlife contact, access to raw milk and living with people with active _M. bovis_ infection. Four owners and one veterinary surgeon were found to have high likelihood of latent tuberculosis infection. One owner required treatment. Although it was not possible to conclusively demonstrate a zoonotic origin for these infections, neither was it possible to eliminate the possibility. Our results provide compelling evidence that the commercial raw diet of these cats was the likely route of _M. bovis_ infection in this outbreak of cases."

The evidence for the commercial raw food being the likely source of cat infection (and, indirectly or directly, of human infection), as presented, is compelling indeed.

The following excerpt from the discussion section deserves being underlined (references omitted]:

"The Food Standards Agency (FSA) state in the recall of the cat food product implicated in this outbreak that it was because "the ingredients were not inspected in line with EU [European Union] requirements." The inclusion of meat from insufficiently examined carcasses in a raw food product is extremely high risk for the spread of infectious diseases, including the potential for tuberculosis, as we have previously documented in hunting hounds. It also exposes anyone working with or handling the product to the risk of disease, such as workers in cutting plants breaking down carcasses with machinery that could easily generate transmissible aerosols of tuberculosis. One other possible route of contamination is that because the whole carcass of a large game animal is not always required for post-mortem inspection to certify it as fit for human consumption, lesions may be missed. For example, for deer, the head can be discarded prior to inspection, even though a common location for tuberculous lesions is the palatine tonsils. Because it is plausible that a single infected deer carcass led to the infection of at least 128 cats in this outbreak, the circumstances demonstrate the critical importance of meat inspection and the essential role of trained meat inspectors to this process for the protection of both human and animal health."
