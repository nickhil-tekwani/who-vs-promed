More pig Ebola cases confirmed
------------------------------
A total of 4 more pig farm workers have tested positive for the Ebola
Reston Virus (ERV), health officials revealed yesterday [Fri 30 Jan
2009]. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said 4 were found
positive out of 77 individuals suspected of being exposed to the
virus. "The 4 new cases bring the total number of ERV
antibody-positive humans to 5 as of 30 Jan 2009," Duque told a news
conference yesterday.

Duque, however, assured the public there is no cause for alarm since
the ERV poses no threat to human health. Duque said the total of 5
individuals found positive for the virus were workers of pig farms in
Bulacan, Pangasinan, and Valenzuela City, while another worker was
traced to a slaughterhouse in Pangasinan. He said all of them were
males and have not been sick for the past 12 months. Based on initial
findings, the 5 individuals got exposed by directly handling infected
pigs. Duque said the 5 did not wear any personal protective gear when
handling the infected pigs. He said the presence of ERV antibodies in
the 5 individuals showed they have effectively mounted a protective
defense against the virus. "Like the 1st positive human, the 4 others
are also healthy and have not been seriously ill in the previous 12
months," Duque pointed out.

A World Health Organization (WHO)-led UN team said all the men -- who
are aged between 22 and 52 -- are well and no longer carry the virus
after being able to expel it from their systems. Julie Hall, a member
of the UN investigating team, told a news conference that it was a
"low risk situation and an important situation for animal and human health."

Health authorities traced the 1st case of ERV to a backyard farmer
who had direct contact with sick pigs. Duque said the possibility of
pig-to-human transmission could not be ruled out at this time. Hall
said she agreed with an earlier statement by Duque that a
swine-to-human transmission of the virus "cannot be dismissed."
Duque, however, maintained the risk of the virus spreading from hogs
to humans is still low. "This is a low risk situation to human health
provided that standard hygiene procedures and safety protocols in
animal handling and food preparation are observed." International
health experts supported the report of the Philippine government that
a outbreak of Ebola Reston virus in the country is unlikely.

To avert the possible spread of the virus, Duque said the Philippine
government is closely working with the World Organization for Animal
Health (OIE) and WHO to determine the most likely source of the ERV
and how it spreads in affected farms. The Department of Agriculture
(DA) has maintained the quarantine on the farms in Bulacan and
Pangasinan and the export ban on pork. Duque further revealed that
1039 pig blood samples collected by the expert mission yielded
negative results on antigen tests. "The CDC is still doing the tests
on pig tissue samples and hopefully the results will be available
soon," Duque said, while noting that there is no current unusual pig
illness detected in the 2 farms.

The DA is also investigating reports of hog cholera [classical swine
fever] and salmonella in pigs in Sta. Maria, Davao del Sur, and hog
cholera and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) in
pigs in Sta. Rita, Samar. Pig tissue samples were collected and will
be tested for other pig pathogens, including the ERV. Duque urged the
public to immediately report any "unusual occurrences of sick or dying
pigs" to local veterinary or agriculture authorities. He said the
Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI) is set to conduct a Luzon-wide
surveillance and improve vaccine coverage against common pig diseases
with high morbidity and mortality to reduce outbreaks in the swine
population.

DA will also enhance bio-security measures to prevent and contain any
future outbreaks as the government's 2nd line of defense to the
spread of the virus. The DA and the Department of Health further
emphasized the need for all animal handlers in commercial and
backyard farms to practice safe farming and biosecurity measures.

The Occupational Safety and Health Center of the Department of Labor
and Employment (DOLE) will also come up with guidelines to ensure the
occupational safety of all animal handlers as well as other
recommendations on the proper use of personal protective equipment.

Duque said the government is working to prevent the entry into the
market of "double dead" meat [meat killed by accident or disease, then
butchered to be sold as fresh; uninspected or contaminated, and
illegally sold].

BAI has already enhanced their pig movement and shipment control, and
increased strategically located quarantine checkpoints to prevent
transport of sick pigs, he said. The National Meat Inspection Service
(NMIS) has also tightened its control and is working closely with
local governments to curb this unsafe practice. Duque reminded the
public to cook meat thoroughly and avoid consumption of raw or
undercooked meat.

[A correspondent has pointed out that the 4 cases cited in the ProMED
post archived as 20090130.0417 are additional cases, and do not
include the 1st reported case, although this is not clearly indicated
in the original source article for this posting. Consequently the
total is now apparently 4 plus 1 = 5. This is clearly indicated in the
alternative report posted above. The back-yard farmer mentioned in the
previous report was the initially confirmed human case of Ebola-Reston
virus infection. - Mod.CP]
