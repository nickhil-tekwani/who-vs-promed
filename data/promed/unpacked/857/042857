[Although most mammals are susceptible to infections with pseudorabies virus (PRV), swine seem to represent the main host reservoir. Due to increased control efforts and the strict implementation of eradication programs, which have included large-scale vaccination, and using the strategy of differentiating infected from vaccinated animals, Aujesky's disease has virtually disappeared from domestic pigs in several parts of Europe, including France (except for a few departments).

PRV-infected feral swine represent a potential source of infection for domestic pigs in North America. By contrast, reports on PRV infections of wild boar in Europe are scarce. Based on official hunting statistics, Germany and France are believed to have among the highest population densities of wild boar in Europe. Serosurveys revealed the occurrence of PRV infections in wild boar in at least 14 European countries, including Belgium, Croatia, the Czech Republic, the former Yugoslavia, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovenia, Spain, and Switzerland, with the average seroprevalence ranging between 0.3% and 66%. - Mod.PMB
