Six people, including one child, have died of tick-borne encephalitis in
Russia's Far Eastern Maritime region this year. More than 120 people have
been hospitalized with this diagnosis. Over 4000 people have reported for
medical examination after being bitten by ticks.
Previously it was reported that 4 people have died of tick bites this
summer in the Irkutsk region, and more than 100 people have been
hospitalized. Specialists stress the low percentage of preventive
inoculations, which results in complications.
Specialists at the Regional Centre for Prophylaxis report that ticks have
become more active in Maritime forests than in the previous few years.
These [arthropods can be seen not only in the country, but also in city
parks. That is a result of unusually dry and hot weather that has set in
this summer in the Maritime region.
The number of intestinal infections has also doubled in the region.
Epidemiologists say that people are now catching the disease not [only by
drinking infected water, but also by eating poor- quality foodstuffs,
including meat and milk.

[An outbreak or enteroviral meningitis in the Pimorsk Region has also be
attributed to the unusually hot and dry weather prevailing in the Far
Eastern Regions of Russia this summer. Russian Spring-Summer encephalitis
virus (a flavivirus) is presumably responsible for the outbreak of
tick-borne encephalitis. The second paragraph is ambiguous: it is unclear
whether the "complications" are due to the properties of the vaccine used,
or to a reduction in the up-take of vaccine. - Mod.CP
