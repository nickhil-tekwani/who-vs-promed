No New West Nile Virus-positive Results
---------------------------------------
As of Wed 6 Jun 2001, no new positive results were reported. Total number
of West Nile virus-positive specimens for New York for the year: One dead
bird was collected in Westchester County.
In 2000 an association was noted between the weekly dead crow density and
human cases of West Nile virus (WNV) infection. Consequently dead crow
density may provide, along with other surveillance indicators, a forecast
of human WNV risk. No human cases occurred in counties with low weekly dead
crow densities (less than 0.1 per sq. mile). Occasional human cases
occurred within a few weeks after counties reported moderate dead crow
densities. In the only county with a high dead crow density (greater than
1.5 per sq. mile), an outbreak of human cases began approximately 2 weeks
later. The New York Department of Health Website now provides a weekly
listing of dead crow densities by county, and a Dead Crow Density Map in
GIF and PDF formats. (Dead crow sightings are a possible early warning of,
but not definitive confirmation of, West Nile virus activity. Crows die of
many causes and reporting levels may vary among counties).
The Dead Crow Densities (dead crow sightings per square mile) for the week
27 May to 2 Jun 2001 were recorded as "low" for all counties with the
exception of Rockland County which was recorded as "moderate."
