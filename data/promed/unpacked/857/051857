In Hawaii (US), _Dickeya dianthicola_ (EPPO A2 List) was detected for the 1st time in January 2018 in potato (_Solanum tuberosum_) plants showing symptoms of bacterial soft rot. Infected plants had been collected from a potato field on Oahu.

[Blackleg of potato can be caused by several species and subspecies of bacteria in the genera _Pectobacterium_ and _Dickeya_. Symptoms may include stem rot leading to leaf yellowing, wilting, and stunting of plants, as well as tuber rot, which usually starts at the stem end of the tuber. The bacteria are spread with contaminated plant or other material (including seed tubers, farm machinery), by mechanical means and with water. Disease management may include seed tuber handling and cultural techniques, use of clean planting material and phytosanitation to prevent introduction of the pathogen from external sources. Low levels of seed tuber infection pose a major risk of pathogen spread, and certification schemes are a vital part of disease management for these pathogens.

Population shifts of the blackleg pathogens are being observed in many areas. For example, _P. atrosepticum_ was considered to be the main blackleg pathogen in Europe, until the emergence of the more virulent new species _D. solani_ (ProMED-mail post 20091207.4162). _P. wasabiae_ and _D. dianthicola_ are also known to cause the disease in Europe. _P. carotovorum_ subsp. _brasiliensis_ (Pcb) has been reported as a causal agent from a number of countries in different parts of the world, and in the Netherlands, it has replaced a predominant _D. solani_ within just a few years (ProMED-mail post 20160128.3974722). _D. solani_ has not yet been detected in the Americas. Possible reasons for these population shifts are thought to be climate changes and selection pressure due to intensified agriculture.

In North America, _D. dianthicola_ was known to be present on ornamentals but was only more recently observed on potato (ProMED-mail post 20160509.4211696) in several mainland US states as well as Ontario province in Canada. It is not clear whether this is due to a new pathogen strain with extended host range. _D. dianthicola_ blackleg is now considered an emerging disease in North America.

_Pectobacterium_ and _Dickeya_ species or subspecies also cause bacterial soft rot of potato. The pathogens can also affect other crops, causing, for example, a foot rot disease in rice as well as stem and root rot of sweet potato.
