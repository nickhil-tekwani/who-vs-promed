Gopher tortoises are falling victim to a contagious respiratory disease
that some biologists fear could bring them to the brink of extinction.
Joan Berish, a biologist with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation
Commission, is trapping the tortoises to get a better handle on how many
are infected, how fast the disease is spreading and how many are dying.
"We just don't know," said Berish, who has been studying the stubby-limbed
tortoises for 20 years. "These animals don't unlock their secrets quickly."
Sixty tortoises were fitted last year with radio transmitters, and during
the past 2 months, Berish has been trapping them again at 4 sites in North
Florida.
Last week, Berish and research assistant Lori Wendland returned to Cecil
Field Naval Air Station, near Jacksonville, to set traps for the colony of
tortoises living near the base runway. The traps are 5-gallon buckets sunk
into the ground near their burrows.
They found gopher tortoise No. 27 in the first trap they checked and took
blood and mucus samples.
Last year, No. 27 tested negative. This year she doesn't have a runny nose
or swollen eyelids, the classic symptoms but some tortoises can look fine
and still carry the disease.
Researchers think the tortoise disease -- which is spread when tortoises
mate or fight -- is chronic. Some diseased tortoises stop eating, become
sluggish and eventually die. Gopher tortoises can live 60 years and grow as
big as small watermelons.
In some parts of Florida the disease is thought to be responsible for the
deaths of more than 100 tortoises.
The epidemic comes as tortoise numbers continue dropping because of habitat
loss. They're endangered in several states and are a "species of special
concern" in Florida.
Berish and Wendland will drive to Cecil Field every day until every study
tortoise is retrapped and tested again.
"Sometimes I feel like I'm at the bottom of a gopher-tortoise burrow
because I spend so much time out here," she said. "It's hot, dirty work but
it's a labor of love. We have to find out who's living and who's dying with
this disease."
