An outbreak of a sexually transmitted infection is rapidly spreading through Melbourne's outer suburbs, leaving experts baffled as to the cause. New research from Alfred Health has revealed the areas of Brimbank and Melton in the city's north-west, and Casey in the city's south-east, are showing a surging number of gonorrhea cases.

The study is the 1st of its kind to track the geographical distribution of the STI [sexually transmitted infection] over 10 years and found lower income areas further from Melbourne's CBD [Central Business District] were more susceptible.

'Why this is occurring is the million-dollar question,' Alfred Health epidemiologist and biostatistician Eric Chow told The Age. Historically, gonorrhoea was mostly circulated among men who had sex with other men but the research also shows women are getting infected at an alarming rate.

The infection, also known as 'the clap' is caused by bacteria which colonises the genital region and can be treated by antibiotics. But, if left untreated, it can cause infertility in women. Worryingly, there is also an antibiotic resistant version that has been detected in cases in every Australian state and territory.

Victoria recorded more than 7000 cases last year [2021] but experts say the real number is likely much higher with many cases not showing symptoms and going undetected.

Associate Professor Chow said since 2010, gonorrhoea infections in females had increased more than 5-fold. The number rose from 291 to almost 1600 last year [2021], showing heterosexual gonorrhoea was endemic in Australia.

He said lockdowns had not seemed to slow the spread of the infection, particularly in lower socioeconomic areas. 'It's just gone up exponentially among women in the outer suburbs of Melbourne,' Mr Chow said. 'We really don't know whether it is because of the lack of sexual health literacy and services, or whether it is more risky behaviour in those areas. But definitely the outer suburbs are becoming our greatest area of concern.'

The Alfred Institute has established 3 general practice clinics in the Melbourne suburbs of Hillside, Tarneit, and Clayton to combat the outbreak.

Outbreaks of gonorrhoea are spreading rapidly through Melbourne's outer suburbs, with doctors warning that the municipalities of Melton, Casey, and Brimbank are now battling an evolving epidemic of the sexually transmitted disease that has alarmed and perplexed experts. New research from Alfred Health has, for the 1st time, tracked the geographical distribution of gonorrhoea over a decade, finding growing clusters of the sexually transmitted infection were infiltrating some of the most socioeconomically disadvantaged areas of Melbourne.

Alfred Health epidemiologist and biostatistician Eric Chow, who led the study, said while the disease previously circulated among men who had sex with other men, a growing number of women were becoming infected. "Why this is occurring is the million-dollar question," Associate Professor Chow said. "We really don't know whether it is because of the lack of sexual health literacy and services, or whether it is more risky behaviour in those areas. But definitely, the outer suburbs are becoming our greatest area of concern."

Victoria recorded more than 7000 gonorrhoea cases last year [2021], compared to roughly 6500 cases in 2020, but screening of people without symptoms plummeted by almost 70 per cent during the pandemic and experts warn the true number of infections is probably far higher than official state government figures.

Associate Professor Chow said the study found that since 2010, gonorrhoea infections in females had increased more than 5-fold from 291 in a year, to almost 1600 last year [2021], showing heterosexual gonorrhoea was now endemic in Australia.

The research comes as Victoria battles a wave of syphilis outbreaks that has led to at least 4 fetal deaths in Victoria in recent years after several babies contracted syphilis from their mothers. The sharp rise in deaths followed a 14-year absence of fatal cases. Exactly why this is occurring remains unclear. Growing research suggests casual sexual activity reduced and dating app use declined during the pandemic.

Associate Professor Chow did say increased sexual promiscuity linked to the explosion in dating apps might have been one factor that had led to a sustained increase in STIs. But he believes the issue is far more complex than that, noting there was a rise in gonorrhoea in the early 2010s, before the online introduction apps became commonplace. "One of the most concerning things to us is the increase in the disease among heterosexual men and women," Associate Professor Chow said. "It's just gone up exponentially among women in the outer suburbs of Melbourne."

The research found that there was the sharpest rise in cases between 2017 and 2019 with 24 825 notified gonorrhoea cases in Victoria, of which one in 5 were women, 13 per cent were heterosexual males, and about 42 per cent were men who had sex with men. It also found rates of infections of the STI had more than tripled in the outer suburbs of Melbourne.

Infections of gonorrhoea among men who have sex with men are concentrated in inner metropolitan Melbourne, and experts said research showed this cohort were the most likely to be regularly screened for STIs, which may explain the higher rates of detection.

But of increasing concern to doctors, is the growing number of cases among women concentrated in the outer suburbs, where there remained a worrying lack of health services screening for sexually transmitted diseases and Associate Professor Chow said there was an urgent need for more support.

Data from the Victorian government's infectious diseases surveillance report shows the City of Yarra, which includes inner-city suburbs Fitzroy, Collingwood, and Abbotsford, had the highest increase in cases, reporting 535 infections last year [2021], compared to 380 in 2020.

Problematically, gonorrhoea has become increasingly immune to antibiotics and a drug-resistant strain of the bacteria, dubbed a "super-superbug", has been detected in every Australian state and territory. Associate Professor Chow said there were international concerns about rising resistance to the antibiotic drugs prescribed to treat gonorrhoea. "This is quite concerning because it will make the infection more difficult to treat," he said.

Associate Professor Marcus Chen, from Melbourne Sexual Health Centre, said experts were now examining where Victorians were acquiring gonorrhoea, noting a limitation of the recent study was that it was based on the residence of the notified cases. "We're getting a feeling there's an element of marginalisation linked to outbreaks," Associate Professor Chen said. "There's obviously something driving new infections, but if testing and treatment were sufficient to offset it, then you wouldn't get a worsening epidemic, which is what we are seeing."

["Melbourne is the capital and most populous city in the Australian state of Victoria and the 2nd most populous city in Australia." (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne). A ProMED map of Australia can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=8701917,295.

In May 2021, ProMED posted a news report of an outbreak of syphilis in urban poor women in Melbourne's outer suburbs (Brimbank and Melton to the city's northwest, and Casey, to the city's southeast) that was associated with an increase in cases of congenital and ocular syphilis (see ProMED post Syphilis - Australia: (VI) ocular, women, congenital, urban poor, genotyping, alert 20210518.8367315). In that outbreak, scientists were said to be using genomic sequencing for the 1st time to track syphilis cases.

The May 2021 report attributed the increase in STDs in lower-socio economic communities in Melbourne's outer suburbs in part to barriers in accessing healthcare. A report on the effects that social and economic conditions in these areas of Melbourne have on health care can be found in a report entitled "HealthWest Partnership response to the Senate Committees on Community Affairs: Australia's domestic response to the World Health Organization's (WHO) Commission on Social Determinants of Health report -- Closing the gap within a generation" (https://bit.ly/3yiFwrI).

The current news reports above are now reporting an outbreak of gonorrhea, another sexually transmitted disease (STD), in the same Melbourne outer suburbs of Brimbank, Melton, and Casey as previously reported for syphilis, among women apparently in the same demographic group that was affected by syphilis. A map showing the location of these 3 Melbourne suburbs can be found at https://www.theage.com.au/national/gonorrhoea-epidemic-hits-citys-outer-suburbs-20220302-p5a0vv.html. We are not told if antibiotic resistant strains of gonococci are involved in this outbreak.

In recent ProMED posts, illicit drug use, namely methamphetamine, has been cited as a contributing factor to recent increases in STDs in women in both the United States and Canada (see the "See Also" section below). Illicit drug use is associated with sexual behaviors that increase the risk of acquiring syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases, including having multiple anonymous sex partners, inconsistent condom use, and exchange of sex for drugs or money.

More information on this outbreak of STDs in Melbourne suburbs would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML]
