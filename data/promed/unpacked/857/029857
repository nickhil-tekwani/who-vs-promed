[C] Update 74 - Global decline in cases and deaths continues 5 Jun 2003
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_06_05/en/>

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Marianne Hopp <mjhopp12@yahoo.com>
for continued monitoring of WHO reports. - Mod.MPP]

As of today, a cumulative total of 8403 probable cases with 775
deaths has been reported from 29 countries. This represents an
increase of 6 new cases and 3 deaths compared with yesterday.

The new cases occurred in Canada (5) and Taiwan (1). New deaths were
reported in China (2) and Hong Kong (1).

Health authorities in some of the earliest areas to experience severe
outbreaks are maintaining measures to protect against a resurgence of
cases. Hong Kong authorities have announced their intention to
maintain current screening procedures at all border points for at
least one year.

The measures, which began at the end of March [2003], include use of
infrared temperature scanners at border points, and obligatory health
declarations from all travellers. No new imported cases have occurred
since these measures were introduced.

Hong Kong is also setting up a master list of imported cases.
Approximately 6 percent of all SARS cases in Hong Kong are now
thought to have been imported. To date, Hong Kong has experienced
1748 cases and 284 deaths, making it the second most severely hit
area, with mainland China at the top.

Hong Kong shares a border with Guangdong Province, China. The disease
was first brought to Hong Kong in late February [2003], when an
infected medical doctor from the province spread the virus to at
least 13 guests and visitors, all on the same floor of the hotel
where he stayed. They carried the disease with them when they
returned home, seeding the earliest outbreaks in Viet Nam, Singapore,
and Toronto as well as Hong Kong.

In these initial outbreaks, SARS first took root in hospital
settings, where staff, unaware that a new disease had surfaced and
fighting to save the lives of patients, exposed themselves to the
infectious agent without barrier protection. All of these initial
outbreaks were subsequently characterized by chains of secondary
transmission outside the health care setting.

At present, local chains of transmission are occurring only in
Toronto and several parts of China. All other countries with imported
cases have managed either to prevent transmission entirely or limit
additional cases to very small numbers.

Doctors at Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital are examining a patient who
may be Montreal's first case of SARS. A female patient who had been
treated at a Toronto hospital where SARS had been identified was
brought by ambulance to hospital Thu [5 Jun 2003] morning with some
SARS symptoms. "That person is now isolated in our emergency ward in
a negative pressure room," said hospital spokesman Alain Charbonneau.

A young man was hospitalized with SARS-like symptoms on Sakhalin on
Thursday, a local health authority told Interfax. The man, aged 21,
had recently come to Sakhalin from a military unit in Ussuriisk in
Primorye Territory. The man went to a polyclinic and said he had
been feeling bad since 17 May 2003. The doctors who examined him
found several symptoms that are consistent with SARS. The man was
immediately admitted to a hospital for infectious diseases. 19 people
who had contact with him have been quarantined.

[As of 5 Jun 2003 there have been a cumulative total of 8403 probable
cases of SARS with 775 deaths reported from 29 countries. In the
past 24 hours there have been 6 new probable cases reported; 5 from
Canada and 1 from Taiwan. According to the Health Canada website,
the most recent date of onset of probable cases identified is 31 May
2003 (or 1 Jun 2003 -- the 4 Jun 2003 epidemiologic discussion
mentioned a 1 Jun 2003, but the 5 Jun 2003 update mentions 31 May
2003).

Noteworthy is the marked decrease in numbers of cases reported with a
total of 6 new cases reported worldwide today. No new cases were
reported from China or Hong Kong today.

In the news brief section there is mention of a possible case in
Quebec (Montreal) Canada with history of health care environment
exposure in Ontario (Toronto). In addition, there is mention of a
possible case in the Far East of Russia with possible exposure in the
Primorsky Region a border region with China and not far from
Blagoveshchensk where the first (and only) probable case of SARS has
been reported. More information on this case would be appreciated. -
