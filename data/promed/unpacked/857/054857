[From a previous ProMED-mail post: The difference is related to the
distance from the bite to the brain -- rabies virus travels, very slowly,
along nerve fibers. - Mod.JW
There are data to the contrary. There are old (but good) nerve transection
studies in animals demonstrating that rabies virus actually remains
localized at or near the bite site for most of the incubation period.
However, the virus cannot be detected in any tissue (nerve and muscle
included) during this "eclipse" phase. Once the virus enters the nerve
cell, transit to the brain is rapid and central nervous symptoms follow
quickly. The mechanisms for activation of the virus in its latent state
remain elusive.
[From the previous post: The incubation period is usually between 20 and 90
days. It has been reported to be shorter when the site of the bite is on
the head (25-48 days) than when it is on an extremity (48-78 days). This
difference may be related to the severity of the bite or to the quantity of
virus inoculated.
The shorter latency period associated with bites to the face and hands in
comparison to bites to the lower part of the body also has been attributed
(without experimental proof) to the higher density of sensory innervation
in those areas.
