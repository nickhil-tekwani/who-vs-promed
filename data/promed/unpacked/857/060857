More than 100 suspected cases of chickungunya have been reported in
Kothra village of Nandod taluka, Narmada district recently. The
district health authorities had sent blood samples of 5 individuals
for further tests at the B J Medical College in Ahmedabad, of which 2
cases have tested positive.

Chickungunya cases were 1st reported on 6 Mar [2009]. Narmada
district health officials said the disease had spread across Dabhoi
taluka in Vadodara district. Pradeep Prajapati, Joint Director of
Malaria programme in Gujarat, who visited the village, said: "The
chikungunya virus is endemic in the state and sporadic cases have
been reported from some places."

Narmada Chief District Health Officer Dr Appu Rao said: "The health
officials 1st came to know about the case on 6 Mar [2009]. The cases
were taken to the Primary Health Centre (PHC) at Jesalpur. There
could be 2 reasons for the spread of the disease: one due to the
extensive breeding of the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes in the utensils
used to feed livestock. Secondly, the virus could have spread from
the neighbouring villages." He added that nearly 15 people from
Dabhoi, Vadodara district, visited Kothra village in February [2009]
for a religious meet and might have carried the virus, which has now spread.

Meanwhile, Vadodara health authorities denied having any reports on
the outbreak across the. The district health authorities had carried
out health inspection in Savli and Dabhoi talukas on Friday [13 Mar
2009]. Blood samples of all the fever cases were collected for
further tests for chikungunya and other vector borne diseases.

Dr Rao refused to divulge further details about 2 confirmed cases of
chickungunya. He said: "We have started anti-larval activities, and
are also spreading information in the area."

[If 3 of the 5 suspected chikungunya cases were laboratory negative
for that virus, on wonders if another agent of febrile disease,
perhaps dengue virus, was also being transmitted simultaneously in the area.
