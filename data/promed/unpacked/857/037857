Leprosy is increasing alarmingly in Andhra Pradesh with the government doing little to check the bacterial infection from spreading, experts said as a staggering 8285 cases were reported in the state during 2012-13. As many as 239 new cases were detected in Hyderabad in the same period.

Health department officials said Andhra Pradesh now figures among the top 12 states with the highest caseloads of leprosy in the country. The proportion of new paediatric cases in the state was also among the highest in the country, experts said. Data from the National Leprosy Eradication Programme shows that out of the total new cases, a substantial 911 cases (11.34 per cent) are of children, officials said.

Experts said the numbers have gone up particularly in the last 2 years. During 2011-12, 7820 cases were detected, they pointed out and attributed the situation to the state government's apathy towards the health issue, so much so that it is now regaining ground.

"We could not identify these cases well in time," said Dr Michael Sukumar, a WHO consultant who is working with the state leprosy cell [in Hyderabad], underscoring a situation when agencies are sometimes helpless when local governments fail to read health warnings.

Experts said people wrongly assume that the ancient disease is non-existent now. Also, people affected by leprosy still live in leprosy colonies, because they have no other option as the disease has a deep-rooted stigma attached to it since ancient times. There are 3 such colonies in Hyderabad at Maula Ali, Vanasthalipuram, and Borabanda.

There are several pockets in the state where the disease has regained ground. Numbers of children with leprosy have been found to be high in East and West Godavari, Krishna, Guntur, Nellore, Chittoor, Kadapa, Kurnool, and Medak. West Godavari reported the highest number of children with leprosy followed by Nellore. Cases with severe deformities were found in West Godavari, Krishna, Guntur, Prakasam, Nellore, Kadapa, Anantapur, Kurnool, Mahbubnagar, Nizamabad, and Khamman.

Vineeta Shankar, director, Sasakawa India Leprosy Foundation, said lepers face enormous stigma and discrimination at all levels. "Even in public hospitals, they are treated badly. Opening a bank account is almost impossible," said Shankar. "Family members who do not suffer from the disease also face the stigma. It is not always easy to get admission in government schools, as teachers are scared. Other children do not talk to them," she said.

"Getting disability pension, which they are entitled to, is a problem because of bureaucratic problems. The crucial support system is lacking at all levels and the situation in AP is pathetic," said MA Shakeel, an advocate, who filed a PIL [public-interest litigation] on the condition of leprosy patients in the state a few years ago.

However, Shankar emphasized that 90-95 per cent of human beings are genetically immune to leprosy and, hence, it is not such a big public threat. Early deformity can be corrected by physiotherapy and corrective surgeries. However, if the disease has progressed, it can only be managed.
