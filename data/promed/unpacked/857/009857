A Further Comment on Zoonotic Transmission of Hepatitis E Virus
----------------------------------------------------------------
Other than transmission from non-human primates (as was pointed out
by Dr. Shapiro in the ProMED-mail post archived as Hepatitis E virus,
new genotypes - Japan (02) 20020722.4837), I am unaware of any
evidence that proves any other animal species is capable of harboring
hepatitis E virus (HEV) and transmitting it to humans. The first post
on this subject pointed the finger at rats, pigs, and goats. The fact
that "...a number of HEV-like sequences have also been isolated from
swine worldwide, suggesting the potential of an animal reservoir", as
the moderator added, is not enough to validate making such claims.
Zoonotic transmission of this virus seems to have grown into mythic
proportions. If anyone has studies that prove otherwise I would very
much like to hear of them.
