Korea claims bluetongue in cattle
---------------------------------
Attempts to re-start [Australia's live cattle trade with Korea have had
another setback. Korean authorities claim 2 of 600 head of cattle being
held in quarantine have tested positive to the bluetongue virus.
Shipments of live cattle were stopped last month after violent protests by
Korean farmers, who objected to the opening up of the cattle market to
imported livestock.
Kevin Shiell, the chief executive of The Australian Livestock Export
Corporation Ltd. (Livecorp), says the test results are puzzling and
disappointing, and continued, "Certainly it's been a setback, there are a
lot worse diseases around than bluetongue, unfortunately however the
protocol specifies animals must be tested negative. That was done in
Australia prior to their departure, and for some reason 2 have shown up at
the other end as positives. Now we need to get to the bottom as to why
that occurred."
