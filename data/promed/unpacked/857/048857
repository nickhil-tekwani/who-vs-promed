According to the Dominican Institute of Agricultural and Forestry
Research (IDEAF), symptoms on rice plants of spikelet abortion and
discolouration resulting in stained grain, were observed in Nagua
[Maria Trinidad Sanchez province], Bonao [Monsenor Nouel province],
and Villa Vasquez [Monte Cristi province] between 2007 and 2009.

At a conference in Dominican Republic, Gustavo Prado of the
International Centre for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) based in
Colombia, spoke on the bacterium called "_Burkholderia glumae_" that
affects the rice.

He urged the public and private sectors to counter the advance of this
bacterium and suggested measures such as developing training workshops
for producers, identifying and evaluating tolerant varieties, using
certified seed, identifying the most favourable time for planting, and
avoiding stress to plants due to indiscriminate use of agrochemicals.
The disease can spread through infected seeds, with soil, and on weed
hosts in the field.

[_Burkholderia glumae_ (previously _Pseudomonas glumae_) causes
bacterial panicle blight of rice as well as bacterial wilts in a
number of other field crops. It has been known in Japan since 1955 and
has recently also been reported in other rice-producing countries
around the world. For example, in the late 1990's it caused
devastating yield losses in Bengal, India, and several outbreaks have
resulted in severe crop losses in the southern USA. It is considered
an emerging disease in Colombia (ProMED-mail post 20090921.3315).

Symptoms may include sheath, seedling and grain rots, as well as
abortion of florets resulting in greatly reduced grain filling and the
potential for yield losses as high as 40 percent. Disease development
is favoured by warm temperatures. Despite its economic importance,
virulence mechanisms of _B. glumae_ are poorly understood. The
pathogen is carried on the seed and is often present in commercial
rice seed. No complete resistance has been identified anywhere in the
world, but cultivars with reduced sensitivity are available and
resistance breeding programmes are in progress.
