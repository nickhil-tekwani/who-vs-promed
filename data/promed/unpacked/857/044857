Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Paralimni, Ammochostos
Date of start of the outbreak: 20 Sep 2017
Outbreak status: resolved on 20 Sep 2017
Epidemiological unit: not applicable
Total animals affected
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Eurasian buzzard (common buzzard): _Buteo buteo_ (Accipitridae) / - / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0
Affected population: A dead wild bird (_Buteo buteo_) was submitted to the veterinary services in the framework of the avian influenza (AI) surveillance program in wild birds. On [4 Oct 2017], it was tested positive by M-gene RT-PCR (Influenza A) at the National Reference Laboratory. On the same day, RT-PCR testing was performed for the detection of H5 or H7 AI virus and it proved to be H5 positive. On [9 Oct 2017], intestinal contents and intestinal tissues were sent to the OIE Reference Laboratory for confirmation and molecular sequencing and were confirmed to be H5N8 positive on [19 Oct 2017]. On [23 Oct 2017], molecular sequencing was completed and a cleavage site motif of PLREKRRKRGLF i.e. HPAI H5 was obtained.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive.

Control measures
Measures applied: vaccination prohibited, no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results/ Species / Test / Test date / Result
Animal Health Laboratory (National laboratory)/ Eurasian buzzard (common buzzard) / reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 4 Oct 2017 / Positive
Animal and Plant Health Agency, Weybridge (OIE Reference Laboratory) / Eurasian buzzard (common buzzard) / nucleotide sequencing / 23 Oct 2017 / Positive

[This is the first time that HPAI H5N8 has been detected in Cyprus.

Wild birds can normally carry avian influenza viruses in their respiratory or intestinal tracts but they do not commonly get sick. They have historically been known as reservoirs and vectors of AI viruses. Around the world, surveillance measures have been put in place to monitor occurrence and characteristics of AI viruses in wild birds. The majority of avian influenza viruses does not cause disease in wild birds, but is very likely that wild birds might spread the virus via their migratory flyways.

National authorities are strongly encouraged to raise the awareness and established cooperation mechanism with hunters and other individuals who may come into contact with wild birds in order to provide early information on sick or dead wild birds http://www.oie.int/fr/pour-les-medias/communiques-de-presse/detail/article/questions-and-answers-on-high-pathogenic-h5n8-avian-influenza-strain-update-27112014/. - Mod.CRD]

An outbreak of avian influenza (strain H-5/N-8) was found in the Haskovo region, said the press office of Haskovo Regional Administration. It was registered in the village of Uzundzhovo, Haskovo region. The Regional Epizootic Commission called an urgent meeting. It made a decision on restrictive measures to prevent the spread of the disease.

The regional governor ordered the Regional Food Safety Directorate (RFSD) - Haskovo, jointly with ornithological societies, hunting and fishing associations and state forestries, to organise inspections for the presence of sick or dead wild or synanthropic birds. The Director of RFSD Haskovo has to establish permanent veterinary and medical control over compliance with biosecurity measures in poultry farms. Bird sales and exhibitions are prohibited in the area.

Owners and managers of poultry farms were ordered to keep their poultry inside and prevent contact with wild birds. They will also need to keep domestic ducks and geese separately from other poultry types.

According to the order, bird keepers are obliged to immediately notify the veterinarian or the mayor if their birds show symptoms of disease or there is an increase in deaths.

[The last updated outbreak assessment on Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N8 in the UK and Europe published by DEFRA on 22 Oct 2017, also indicates that "Bulgaria has reported two outbreaks of H5N8 HPAI in poultry - one in a commercial duck unit of approx. 10 000 birds and the other on a backyard farm". https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/654445/hpai-europe-update16.pdf.

Therefore, the subtype involved in the current HPAI event in Bulgaria appears to be H5N8, (see posting 20171023.5398822). - Mod CRD]
