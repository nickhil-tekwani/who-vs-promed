Learning from Ebola: Why the world needs to take MERS more seriously
--------------------------------------------------------------------
This month [December 2015], public health experts are gathering at the World Health Organization's Geneva headquarters to try to ensure that [the Ebola] tragedy is not repeated in the case of MERS, or Middle East respiratory syndrome virus, a virus that many fear the world has largely underestimated so far. The goal is to push for a more active response -- to share information on efforts to develop drugs and vaccines and to figure out what still needs to be learned about the virus.

As with Ebola, there are few, if any, tools currently available to use in the case of a major outbreak of MERS. Experts point to last spring's [2015] crippling outbreak in South Korea -- 186 cases, 37 deaths, hospitals closed to new admissions, all stemming from a businessman who came home sick from the Middle East -- as evidence of the danger of underestimating the coronavirus.

Because the MERS virus can be transmitted through coughs and sneezes, its spread could be even more difficult to stop than Ebola, which people only catch if they have contact with blood and body fluids. You can generally avoid someone else's bodily fluids, if you know you need to. But breathing is not an optional endeavor.

"I think the outbreak in Seoul was a wakeup call to a lot of people that what has happened on the Arabian Peninsula is not likely to stay there," said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Diseases Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. "We are going to see more Seouls happening."

Given how long the world has known about the MERS virus -- its existence was revealed in a posting to the Boston-based online diseases surveillance network ProMED by an infectious disease specialist in September 2012. [see Novel coronavirus - Saudi Arabia: human isolate 20120920.1302733 for 1st report on the MERS-CoV. - Mod.LK/Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ/Mod.MPP] -- the list of things that remain to be learned about how people become infected with this virus and how it works in the human body is unsettling.

"It's unfortunate that 3 years after the start of this outbreak and the appearance of this virus in the human population that we still have so little information and that we never seem to have in-depth results of investigations on any of these cases," said Peter Ben Embarek, the WHO's point person for MERS. "We [have] never fully [understood] how they appeared and how they spread." In general terms it is now assumed that sporadic cases appear to be triggered when the virus passes from camels to people. What kind of contact leads to transmission is still not clear. Sporadic cases actually make up a minority of infections, however. The majority of cases are spread from person to person, generally in hospitals, after the original infection takes place. Often a patient who is infected isn't recognized as a MERS case and isn't isolated. Health care workers and nearby patients are exposed and infected. Hospital outbreaks can be very large, sometimes involving scores of cases.

A few university laboratories and biotech companies are working on MERS vaccines. But the research is in the early stages and it will take years -- and major investments -- before any products are ready. If a serious outbreak occurred before then, the medicine cabinet will be empty. "You won't have time to do anything," warned Malik Peiris, a Hong Kong-based microbiologist who sees the virus as a serious and underappreciated global threat.

Peiris has lots of experience with zoonoses -- diseases that jump from animals to people. His lab at the University of Hong Kong was one of 2 that discovered the cause of the 2003 outbreak of SARS, a coronavirus that probably originated in bats. He has worked for years on dangerous avian influenza viruses such as H5N1 and H7N9. The MERS virus makes Peiris nervous.

People fear Ebola because of its high death rate and its popular depiction -- generally untrue -- as a disease that makes victims ooze blood from multiple orifices. But MERS also claims many lives; the World Health Organization estimates about 36 percent of people who become infected die from the disease, which attacks the lungs. [The actual case fatality rate is probably lower than 36 percent -- see comments below. - Mod MPP]. That fact -- that this is a respiratory disease spread like colds and flu -- makes the MERS virus a threat to be taken seriously, Peiris said. That it is a coronavirus is also concerning.

While SARS was stopped before it could entrench itself as a routinely circulating human virus, 2 other coronaviruses -- one originating in bats, the other in cattle -- have succeeded in jumping the species barrier and now regularly infect people. They only cause colds, fortunately. But they prove animal coronaviruses can establish themselves as human diseases. If its relatives can make the leap, it would be unwise to count out MERS, Peiris said.... -- more

[MERS-CoV, like other coronaviruses, is thought to spread from an infected person's respiratory secretions, such as through coughing. However, the precise ways the virus spreads are not currently well understood.

MERS-CoV has spread from ill people to others through close contact, such as caring for or living with an infected person. Infected people have spread MERS-CoV to others in healthcare settings, such as hospitals. Researchers studying MERS have not seen any ongoing spreading of MERS-CoV in the community.

All reported cases have been linked to countries in and near the Arabian Peninsula. Most infected people either lived in the Arabian Peninsula or recently traveled from the Arabian Peninsula before they became ill. A few people became infected with MERS-CoV after having close contact with an infected person who had recently traveled from the Arabian Peninsula.

Public health agencies continue to investigate clusters of cases in several countries to better understand how MERS-CoV spreads from person to person. (http://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/about/transmission.html).

Research is needed on a number of fronts to increase preparedness if a major MERS outbreak were to occur. One goal should be to develop an animal model to study the immunopathogenesis of MERS. Such knowledge will facilitate the development of vaccines and antivirals. Clinical trials will need to be conducted to determine dose and timing of vaccines and antivirals. While there are problems accessing specimens, it is critical to try to move forward with studies that will shed light on the basic biology and transmission of this virus. Because it can be spread by the respiratory route, it potentially presents a serious threat to public health. - Mod.LK]

[bWhile the WHO reported global case fatality rate is approximately 36 percent, the actual case fatality rate is probably significantly lower than 36 percent as many milder infections are often not diagnosed as respiratory infections due to MERS-CoV infection.

In the outbreak in South Korea, the reported case fatality rate was 19 percent (with extensive testing of over 17 000 contacts), whereas in the baseline study on MERS-CoV seroprevalence conducted in Saudi Arabia the authors projected that 44 951 individuals older than age 15 years were most likely infected by MERS-CoV during the study period (infection defined as evidence of seropositivity) compared with slightly more than 700 reported cases during the same period of time. If that estimate is close to reality, then the estimated case fatality rate in Saudi Arabia would be significantly less than observed through case reporting -- approximately 2 percent (see MERS-CoV (38): Saudi Arabia, new fatalities, serosurvey 20150416.3291924 with a discussion on: Muller MA, Meyer B, Corman VM, Al-Masri M, Turkestani A, Ritz D, Sieberg A, Aldabbagh S, Bosch BJ, Lattwein E, Alhakeem RF, Assiri AM, Albarrak AM, Al-Shangiti AM, Al-Tawfiq JA, Wikramaratna P, Alrabeeah AA, Drosten C, Memish ZA: Presence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus antibodies in Saudi Arabia: a nationwide, cross-sectional, serological study.
