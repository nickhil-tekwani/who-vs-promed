Unpasteurized milk taken from a Woodland farm and from the home of a farm
patron have tested positive for _E. coli_ (O157), Clark County's health
officer said Mon, 19 Dec 2005.
Meanwhile, 2 children who became ill from _E. coli_ O157 infection after
drinking unpasteurized milk from Dee Creek Farm are improving after at
least a week in critical condition. "That's very good news," said Dr.
Justin Denny, Clark County's public health officer. One child has been
moved out of a Portland hospital's intensive care unit; the other remains
in intensive care but has been upgraded to serious condition, Denny said.
The children are among 16 people, most of them younger than 14, who last
week became sick with _E. coli_ O157:H7, a potentially deadly pathogen
found in cow colons. Health officials earlier reported 17 cases of _E.
coli_, but the total was lowered Mon, 19 Dec 2005, when they found a
Cowlitz County case mistakenly had been counted twice.
State and county health officials say the common link among the sick --
residents of Clark and Cowlitz counties in Washington and Clatsop County in
Oregon -- was consumption of raw milk or milk products from Dee Creek Farm.
Tests on milk taken last week from the Cowlitz County farm and from milk
obtained by a person who consumes the farm's products were positive for _E.
coli_, though further testing is needed to determine whether it is the same
strain that sickened the people, Denny said. Results from tests on the
cows and other sites at the farm are pending, he said.
Distribution of raw milk products at Dee Creek Farm was halted last week
while Washington State Department of Agriculture and county health
officials investigate the outbreak.
Culture tests at the Washington State Public Health Laboratory have
confirmed that 5 people were infected with _E. coli_ O157:H7, a strain that
can cause kidney damage or death. Blood samples were taken from the others
and sent to CDC for tests that look for antibodies to the pathogen, Denny
said. Those results could take weeks.
Washington allows the direct sale of unpasteurized milk by 6 farms that
have obtained production and bottling licenses. Dee Creek Farm is not licensed.
Health experts yesterday, 19 Dec 2005, finished contacting 45 families and
individuals who received Dee Creek Farm products and are working to
determine whether there are more suspected _E. coli_ cases among them.
