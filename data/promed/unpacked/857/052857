A national alert has been issued as a suspected virus killing pilchards
spreads rapidly throughout South Australian waters. It came as thousands of
tonnes of pilchards continue to be wiped out by the virus, believed to be a
type of herpes.
The crisis has prompted an emergency meeting of fishing industry experts
from the Commonwealth and four States in Adelaide today. Results of
pathology tests carried out in Victoria on dead pilchards will be revealed
at the meeting.
The pilchard deaths have spread along hundreds of kilometres of coastline
from Cape Jervis, south of Adelaide, to Elliston on the State's West Coast
in an almost identical manner to the 1995 kill that saw hundreds of
thousands of tonnes of pilchards die. Thousands of tonnes of rotting
pilchards have now washed up on suburban and country beaches and can be
seen floating on the sea surface from the air. Fisheries officials
yesterday flew by helicopter along the State's coastline recording and
examining the dead pilchards - which in one day spread more than 120km from
Coffin Bay up the West Coast to Elliston.
The Primary Industries Department said yesterday initial pathology tests
carried out on fish which died this week indicated similar gill damage to
the fish killed in 1995. The pilchards which died in 1995 "suffocated" when
their gills became covered with mucous caused by a virus. At the time
hundreds of thousands of tonnes of pilchards were estimated to have died in
the sea between Western Australia and New South Wales.
Industry sources suspect pilchards imported to feed caged tuna at Port
Lincoln have brought a virus into South Australia. Spokesman for the Marine
Scale Pilchard Fishermen's Association Mr Peter Blacker said tests should
be conducted on the imported pilchards. However the virus which killed the
pilchards in 1995 was never conclusively linked to the thousands of tonnes
of imported pilchards which mainly come from the United States.
Fisheries SA's director, Dr Gary Morgan, said present import stocks had not
been tested by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service and might
still be used to feed tuna. Pilchards imported just after the 1995 deaths
were tested by AQIS but the virus was not detected. AQIS said yesterday
there would not be new inspections of imported pilchards as there was no
evidence they were linked to the current deaths.
A spokesman for AQIS said all States and New Zealand had been notified of
the deaths but there had been no deaths outside SA.
