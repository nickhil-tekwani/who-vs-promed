[3] UK: 2nd vaccine doses
Date: Fri 23 Sep 2022
Source: UK Health Security Agence press office [edited]
https://www.gov.uk/government/news/second-vaccine-doses-to-be-offered-to-those-at-highest-risk-from-monkeypox


The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has announced that 2nd doses of the smallpox (Jynneos) vaccine will be offered to people at highest risk from monkeypox, in order to maximise protection against the virus.

This targeted approach is also supported by modelling published in today's [23 Sep 2022] technical briefing 8 which suggests vaccinating 25% of the groups most at risk could significantly reduce the risk of transmission.

Whilst sexual health clinics will continue to prioritise offering 1st doses to those at highest risk, some clinics will also begin to offer eligible people a 2nd dose to provide longer term protection.

The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has endorsed UKHSA's proposal to offer 2nd doses to those at highest risk while continuing efforts to maximise uptake of the 1st dose within this group.

There are no current plans to widen the offer of vaccination beyond the existing priority cohorts, though this decision will be kept under review.

The NHS will call forward those that are eligible for vaccination. The 2nd dose will be offered from around 2 to 3 months after the 1st dose to maximise protection.

As of 20 Sep 2022, more than 45 000 people have received a dose of the vaccine including over 40 000 gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men who are at highest risk of exposure.

In order to maximise the number of people that can be vaccinated, more clinics will offer the vaccine using intradermal administration in the coming weeks. This safe and clinically approved approach has been positively received by patients and staff where it has been used already.

UKHSA has confirmed delivery of 20 000 additional vaccines from Bavarian Nordic, the single global supplier of the vaccine being used in response to the current outbreak of monkeypox in the UK. The vaccines are available for NHS services to order and are being distributed now, with a further 80 000 vaccines expected to arrive later this month. The use of intradermal administration will mean that everyone at highest risk will have access to 2 doses of monkeypox vaccine in the coming months.

As of 16 Sep 2022, there are 3585 confirmed and highly probable cases of monkeypox in the UK. Following a clear peak of more than 60 cases per day in mid-July, the number of cases has decreased throughout August and continues to fall, with less than 15 cases per day on average in early September 2022.

Analysis of wider infection trends suggests changes in behaviour in the groups most at risk may have contributed to the reduced case rates.

Dr Gayatri Amirthalingam, Deputy Director, Public Health Programmes at UKHSA said: It's encouraging that we're continuing to see fewer cases of monkeypox reported in the UK and we are grateful to everyone who has followed advice about potential symptoms, isolated as part of this outbreak or come forward for vaccination to help limit transmission.

Prioritising vaccine stock where possible for 2nd doses for those at highest risk will help us maximise protection and interrupt transmission. When you are called forward for vaccination, please take up the offer.

Professor Sir Andrew Pollard, chair of the JCVI, said: The JCVI has endorsed the UKHSA's proposal that vaccination to protect against monkeypox should continue to be prioritised for those at highest risk of exposure to the virus, including offering 2nd doses to individuals once they become eligible.

This approach will ensure the globally-limited supplies are used most effectively, continuing to break chains of transmission, as well as providing those at highest risk of exposure with longer-lasting protection.

The use of the intradermal vaccination method at some clinics also means more doses can be drawn from the vials, helping to maximise the reach of the UK's supplies and ensure 2nd doses for all those eligible. The JCVI will keep the offer of monkeypox vaccination under review to ensure it continues to have the maximum impact on the current outbreak.

[4] Neurologic and psychiatric presentations
Date: Thu 8 Sep 2022

Citation: Badenboch JB, Conti I, Rengasamy ER, et al. Neurological and psychiatric presentations associated with human monkeypox virus infection: A systematic review and meta-analysis. eClinicalMedicine. 2022; Online First, 101644
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
Background
Neuropsychiatric presentations of monkeypox (MPX) infection have not been well characterised, despite evidence of nervous system involvement associated with the related smallpox infection.

Methods
In this pre-registered (PROSPERO ID 336649) systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, AMED, and the preprint server MedRxiv up to 31 May 2022. Any study design of humans infected with MPX that reported a neurological or psychiatric presentation was included. For eligible symptoms, we calculated a pooled prevalence using an inverse variance approach and corresponding 95% confidence intervals. The degree of variability that could be explained by between-study heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic. Risk of bias was assessed with the Newcastle Ottawa Scale and the Joanna Briggs Institute quality assessment tool.

Findings
From 1705 unique studies, we extracted data on 19 eligible studies (1512 participants, 1031 with confirmed infection using CDC criteria or PCR testing) most of which were cohort studies and case series with no control groups. Study quality was generally moderate. There were 3 clinical features that were eligible for meta-analysis: seizure 2.7% (95% CI 0.7-10.2%, I2 0%), confusion 2.4% (95% CI 1.1-5.2%, I2 0%), and encephalitis 2.0% (95% 0.5-8.2%, I2 55.8%). Other frequently reported symptoms included myalgia, headache, and fatigue, where heterogeneity was too high for estimation of pooled prevalences, possibly as a result of differences in viral clades and study methodology.

Interpretation
There is preliminary evidence for a range of neuropsychiatric presentations including severe neurological complications (encephalitis and seizure) and nonspecific neurological features (confusion, headache, and myalgia). There is less evidence regarding the psychiatric presentations or sequelae of MPX. This may warrant surveillance within the current MPX outbreak, with prospective longitudinal studies evaluating the mid to long-term sequelae of the virus. Robust methods to evaluate the potential causality of MPX with these clinical features are required. More evidence is necessary to explain heterogeneity in prevalence estimates.

Research in context
-------------------
Evidence before this study
Dermatological manifestations of monkeypox (MPX) infection are well characterised; however, possible neuropsychiatric effects have not been systematically evaluated. There is evidence of nervous system involvement associated with 2 related orthopoxviruses, in the case of smallpox infection (with the variola virus) and smallpox vaccination (which contains live vaccinia virus). Neuropsychiatric symptoms and complications can be highly disabling and have a detrimental effect on quality of life; consequently, potential nervous system associations of MPX infection are important to recognise. MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, AMED, and the preprint server MedRxiv were searched up to 31 May 2022 for terms relating to MPX infection and neuropsychiatric features. Any study design was included if it provided data on humans infected with MPX and reported on the presence or absence of neurological or psychiatric clinical features. The majority of studies were of medium quality with significant clinical and statistical heterogeneity.

Added value of this study
This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrate preliminary evidence for a range of neurological and psychiatric presentations of MPX infection. Based on a small number of studies examining this topic, encephalitis, confusion, and seizure are present in small (<3%) but non-negligible proportions of infected individuals. The prevalence of other neuropsychiatric symptoms including headache, myalgia, fatigue, anxiety, and depression is less clear. There are also knowledge gaps surrounding putative factors which influence the risk of neurological and psychiatric presentations including overall MPX infection severity and viral clade.

Implications of all the available evidence
MPX-related nervous system presentations may warrant surveillance within the current monkeypox outbreak, with prospective longitudinal studies evaluating the mid to long-term sequelae of the virus. Robust methods to evaluate the potential causality of MPX with these clinical features are required at an individual and epidemiological level.

[5] Monkeypox emergence in nature

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
An unintended consequence of smallpox eradication and ending the smallpox vaccination campaign has been to render the global human population immunologically naïve to orthopoxvirus infection for the 1st time in history. This has occurred at a time when the majority of people worldwide live in high population densities in cities and when connectivity across the world has never been higher, both of which facilitate the emergence and spread of infectious diseases. It is not surprising, therefore, that novel zoonotic orthopoxvirus infections have been increasing in recent years, or that an international outbreak of human monkeypox disease has occurred. A One Health approach, including consideration of land-use change and the bushmeat and exotic pet trades, is required to prevent opportunities for the emergence of monkeypox, or diseases caused by other orthopoxviruses, and for a rapid and effective response to any outbreaks in order to limit their spread.

One Health Impact Statement
---------------------------
The current global outbreak of monkeypox is yet another warning for the adoption of a preventative, One Health, approach to minimise the risk of future emergence of known and unknown zoonotic pathogens. This includes the need to consider the roles, and to mitigate the impacts, of land-use change and the bushmeat and exotic pet trades in order to prevent opportunities for the emergence of monkeypox virus, or other orthopoxviruses, and for a rapid and effective response to any outbreaks in order to limit their spread.

As of 9 Sep 2022, there have been 56 098 confirmed cases of monkeypox in people in 96 countries since an initial case was confirmed in the UK on 7 May 2022 (CDC, 2022). However, this does not include infections in Central and West Africa where the infection is endemic and where human cases of the disease have been escalating dramatically in recent years following smallpox eradication (Tasamba, 2022). Monkeypox virus (MPV), the causative agent of monkeypox, is an orthopoxvirus (OPV) closely related to smallpox virus. Following a global vaccination campaign, the World Health Assembly confirmed the eradication of smallpox in 1980, after which vaccination against this disease was ended. During the following 40 years, therefore, and for the first time in history, the global human population has become immunologically naïve to OPVs (Dye and Kraemer, 2022). This has created a gaping ecological niche that is open to exploitation by a new OPV. It is perhaps not surprising, therefore, that zoonotic infections with at least 2 previously unknown OPVs have emerged in recent years: Akhmeta pox and Alaska pox (Vora et al, 2015; Springer et al, 2017). Monkeypox virus is also a zoonotic OPV and, although recognized for many years as a public health threat in waiting subsequent to the decline of smallpox vaccination (Heymann et al, 1998), monkeypox has remained a neglected disease (Di Giulio and Eckburg, 2004; Parker et al, 2007), which is only now receiving attention following its spread to high-income countries.

Monkeypox (re)emergence
-----------------------
On 1 Jun 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the simultaneous appearance of monkeypox in multiple countries outside Africa indicated that 'there may have been undetected transmission for some time' and on 3 Jun 2022 the United States Centers for Disease Control (CDC) announced they had found 2 strains of MPV in the USA (ProMED, 2022a). On 7 Jun 2022, the UK Health Security Agency declared the virus a notifiable disease (ProMED, 2022b) and on 23 Jul 2022 the WHO Director-General declared monkeypox to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (Kozlov, 2022). The current outbreak has been associated with super-spreader events in May 2022: namely festivals in Belgium and Gran Canaria [Spain] plus a sauna in Spain. Media coverage has focused on human sexual contact, particularly male/male, as a primary mode of transmission in this outbreak but this should not be surprising given close human-to-human contact is a known method of MPV spread. Other modes of spread of this relatively environmentally robust virus should also be considered, including via contaminated fomites and mechanical spread by invertebrate vectors. Although not yet identified as routes of transmission for MPV, these are recognized means of transmission for other OPVs and related pox viruses.

The name monkeypox originates from its initial discovery in a group of crab-eating macaque monkeys held in a lab in Denmark in 1958 (Von Magnus et al, 1958). However, subsequent evidence points to one or more species of African rodent as the primary reservoir for this OPV rather than non-human primates. During the smallpox eradication campaign, a single case of monkeypox disease was found in a moribund rope squirrel _Funisciurus anerythrus_ in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in 1985 (Khodakevich et al, 1985), and the disease was next found in the wild in Côte d'Ivoire in a juvenile sooty mangabey _Cercocebus atys_ in 2012 (Radonic et al, 2014); clinical disease is therefore very infrequently found in wildlife. Serological surveys for MPV have found evidence of infection in several species of wild African rodents, including the rope squirrel _Funisciurus_ spp, the sun squirrel _Heliosciurus_ spp, the tiny fat mouse _Steatomys parvus_, the multimammate mouse _Mastomys natalensis_, the African dormouse _Graphiurus kelleni_ and the Gambian giant pouched rat _Cricetomys gambianus_ (Hutin et al, 2001; Reynolds et al, 2010; Nolen et al, 2015; Orba et al, 2015). Epidemiological studies in DRC have highlighted squirrels, particularly rope squirrels occupying agricultural areas close to human settlements, as possible primary candidates for repeated zoonotic transmission (Khodakevich et al, 1985). A seroprevalence study found that MPV seropositivity rates were highest in _Funisciurus_ spp squirrels (24%) compared to those in _Heliosciurus_ spp squirrels (15%) or primates (8%) (Khodakevich et al, 1988). During an outbreak of MPV in people in 1997, seropositivity rates in wildlife were higher at 39-60% in _Funisciurus_ spp, 50% in _Heliosciurus_ spp, and 16% in Gambian giant pouched rats (Hutin et al, 2001). While these squirrels are rare in primary rainforests, they are commonly found in inhabited human-degraded secondary forests, especially where oil palm is grown (Khodakevich et al, 1985). This supports reviews reporting increased zoonotic host frequency in human-dominated ecosystems (Gibb et al, 2020).

Bushmeat trade
--------------
Wild meat, known as bushmeat in Africa, is meat obtained from hunting wild animals for local consumption or income generation through sale as food. In several low-income African countries reporting human MPV outbreaks, there has been a marked decrease in the size of wild animals on sale at markets over time as larger species are hunted out with a subsequent increase in reliance on the consumption of smaller species, particularly rodents (Fa et al, 1997, 2015). The Gambian giant pouched rat, for example, is commonly eaten due to its relatively large size and is, therefore, of particular interest as a potential source of zoonotic infection (Malekani et al, 1994). Further research into the reservoir hosts for MPV is urgently required and is currently in progress in countries with high numbers of human cases such as the DRC. However, less widely known is that demand also comes from in-country and expatriate urban elite who regard bushmeat as a prestigious delicacy and a way of maintaining cultural ties (Walz et al, 2017; Gombeer et al, 2021). As a consequence, and despite extensive legislation banning the import of threatened taxa or indeed any wild meat from Africa, significant quantities of bushmeat are smuggled via personal luggage into major European and US cities on passenger flights from West and Central African source countries where MPV is endemic (Chaber et al, 2010; Falk et al, 2013; Bair-Brake et al, 2014; Ecojust, 2020). A 2018 Belgian study, in which passengers' luggage was searched at Brussels airport, estimated an average of 3.7 tonnes of bushmeat was smuggled in each month; the top countries of origin were DRC, Cameroon, and Côte d'Ivoire (Musing et al, 2018). Highly organized, lucrative, typically clandestine, and illegal international bushmeat trade networks now provide an additional potential route for the global transmission of MPV (Ecojust, 2020).

Pet trade
---------
In 2003, an outbreak of human MPV affected 6 US states. The source was traced to a consignment of 800 live small mammals imported from Ghana to Texas. This comprised 6 genera of rodents, namely tree squirrels _Heliosciurus_ spp, rope squirrels _Funisciurus_ spp, dormice _Graphiurus_ spp, striped mice _Hybomys_ spp, brushtail porcupines _Atherurus_ spp, and Gambian giant pouched rats _Cricetomys_ spp (CDC, 2003). An Iowa animal vendor transported some of the latter to a Chicago pet dealer where they were housed with, and infected, another rodent species, the North American prairie dog _Cynomus_ spp. Prairie dogs from this environment were transferred to a vendor in Wisconsin who sold them to buyers including the index case of the multi-state outbreak. Infected prairie dogs seem to have been the primary source of infection for most of the human cases, having been further distributed in Indiana, Ohio, and Illinois. The CDC and the US Food and Drug Administration subsequently banned the importation of all rodent taxa from Africa (CDC, 2020). Considerable effort was invested in tracing and destroying or quarantining the 800 mammals from the infected African shipment. Virological testing of some of these animals found MPV infection in 3 dormice, 2 rope squirrels, and at least one Gambian giant pouched rat. It is relevant to note that escaped pet Gambian giant pouched rats have established as an invasive species in Florida (Reuters, 2007). Also, the olfactory abilities of the species have led them to be trained to sniff out land mines and tuberculosis infections, thus expanding international demand for the species (APOPO, 2022). Animals should, therefore, test seronegative for MPV prior to being trained. In addition to the legal wild animal pet trade, there is large-scale illicit trafficking of exotic animals as pets and this forms a substantial part of the multibillion-dollar illegal wildlife trade. This has recently expanded in scale and taxonomic composition, facilitated by e-commerce and social media via which wild animals can be relatively easily traded illegally (Hernandez, 2021). The demand is global with intercontinental smuggling involving South America and Asia, as well as Africa and Europe, fuelling the biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services crises and escalating the threat of human exposure to known and unknown pathogens harboured by wildlife along trade routes and within destination countries (Hall, 2019).

Need for a One Health approach
------------------------------
While the eradication of smallpox was a major achievement for human health globally, we have to be cognisant of the vulnerabilities it, along with the ending of smallpox vaccination, has created through the development of an ecological niche for human OPV infection. This has occurred at a time in human history when the majority of people worldwide live in high population densities in cities and when connectivity across the world has never been higher, both of which facilitate the emergence and spread of infectious diseases. That monkeypox has emerged as a public health threat in the global north is not a surprise as its emergence as a public health threat following smallpox eradication was predicted (Heymann et al, 1998; Grant et al, 2020). This emergence may have been facilitated by the international demand for African bushmeat and exotic pets. As with other zoonotic diseases, there needs to be a One Health approach to preventing opportunities for the emergence of monkeypox or other OPVs, and for a rapid and effective response to any emergence to limit spread. The former includes identifying and minimising risky human activities, such as land-use change and the hunting, keeping, or eating of wildlife, especially rodents, or doing so in ways that mitigate the likelihood of zoonotic disease emergence, such as promoting alternatives to bushmeat (Khodakevich et al, 1988), routinely vaccinating people at high risk of exposure, such as those who have close contact with wildlife, and educating people in hygienic procedures such as the use of gloves when handling live and dead wild animals while making such measures available. Preparedness and response could include public awareness campaigns and readily accessible, freely available rapid diagnostics in countries where monkeypox is endemic. The absence of such an approach lends the human population vulnerable to epidemic infection with a novel or known extant OPV.

During the current outbreak, monkeypox has been spreading internationally with cases now recognized in 103 countries (96 where the disease is new and seven where it is already known to be endemic) (CDC, 2022). Historically, the rate of human-to-human transmission (R0) for monkeypox virus has been <1, which means that infection chains are more likely to be short and to die out than they are to continue to be propagated (Grant et al, 2020). This has, however, been the case in populations where immunity from smallpox vaccination has been present to varying degrees, whereas it has been estimated that the R0 in naïve populations would be 1.46-2.67, meaning epidemic disease outbreaks could occur (Grant et al, 2020). This is what is now underway with the current international outbreak and it remains to be seen if repeated transmission amongst people leads to pathogen evolution and a change in pathogenicity or in the transmission rate.

This report provides a concise review of the history and natural history of monkeypox (MPX). The 2 proposed remedies: halting or modifying land use and halting bushmeat consumption and sale. Implementation would be extremely difficult in low-income countries.

In the absence of these measures, there is the need for prompt recognition and response to introduced pathogens. That requires ongoing surveillance supported by prompt and accurate laboratory diagnosis, measures that are often lacking in the countries where these pathogens are endemic. Overcoming these deficiencies will require provision of financial and technical support from high-income countries to endemic countries. - Mod.TY]
