Scientists from the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston
(UTMB) have reported their discovery of the reason behind a
mysterious epidemic on the island of La Reunion in the Indian Ocean.
An outbreak in 2005 and 2006 resulted in the 1st deaths from a virus
called chikungunya, a mosquito borne virus that mutated and became lethal.

In all, 266 000 people were infected, and at least 260 deaths
resulted. Researchers proved the epidemic was caused by a single
mutation and the virus was carried by a mosquito not previously known
to be a carrier. The species, _Aedes albopictus_, also called the
Asian tiger mosquito, has been established in the U.S. for around 20
years and has recently started spreading to Europe [It has become
established in southern Europe and been responsible for a chikungunya
virus epidemic in Italy mentioned below. - Mod.TY].

In its non-lethal form, chikungunya causes extreme arthritis-like
pain, sometimes lasting for months or years. Many tourists became
infected at La Reunion and carried that [La Reunion] strain home with
them. Although no epidemics broke out in Europe [with the La Reunion
strain], the possibility was there. Another strain of the virus
causing an ongoing epidemic in India has spread to humans in Italy
through the Asian tiger mosquito.

"Chikungunya virus had been known to be primarily carried by a
different mosquito, _Aedes aegypti_, which is not found on La
Reunion," said UTMB professor Stephen Higgs of the outbreak on La
Reunion. "Adaptation to _Aedes albopictus_ and introduction to a
human population that had never been exposed to the virus before set
everything up for this outbreak."

The researchers say the mutation gives the new strain of virus an
evolutionary edge over its predecessor and was predominantly
transmitted versus the original strain. The new strain evolved when a
single amino acid chain changed, leading to the ability for the virus
to infect the new mosquito. One of the authors created the same
change in a strain collected in Africa in 1983, which then also
showed a greater ability to infect _Aedes albopictus_.

The virus is transmitted through the saliva of the mosquito just as
in other deadly diseases like malaria and West Nile.

"This is such a simple genetic change -- the equivalent of a missing
comma in a 6-page short story -- and yet it facilitated a huge
epidemic," Higgs said. "With _Aedes albopictus_ already present in so
many countries and likely to spread to others, perhaps helped by
global warming, this shows us that we need to be ready for the
possibility that chikungunya [virus] will soon be spreading to other
locations as well."

[It would be interesting to know whether there is any relationship
between the mutation that facilitates infection of _Ae albopictus_
and increased virus virulence for humans, perhaps being responsible
for the reported deaths in the affected Indian Ocean islands (see
ProMED-mail posting 20061014.2953). - Mod.TY]
