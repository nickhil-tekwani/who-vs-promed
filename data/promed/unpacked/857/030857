Oregon: EV-D68 detected in the 5 patients that died
---------------------------------------------------
The number of states reporting at least confirmed case of enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) infection has increased to 46 and the District of Columbia as Oregon is the latest to see a confirmed case. As of today [Thu 9 Oct 2014], 678 people have been confirmed with the virus via testing by the CDC or state public health laboratories. In addition, the federal health agency reports EV-D68 has been detected in specimens from 5 patients who died and had samples submitted for testing. State and local officials have the authority to determine the cause of death, including the role that EV-D68 may have played. They also have the authority to determine the appropriate information to release, and the time to release it.

CDC has obtained one complete genomic sequence and 6 nearly complete genomic sequences from viruses representing the 3 known strains of EV-D68 virus that are causing infection at this time. Comparison of these sequences to sequences from previous years shows they are genetically related to strains of EV-D68 that were detected in previous years in the United States, Europe, and Asia. CDC has submitted the sequences to GenBank to make them available to the scientific community for further testing and analysis.

Santa Clara County reports its 1st case of the EV-D68 enterovirus strain
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Santa Clara County [California] has reported its 1st case of the enterovirus strain that's responsible for at least 4 deaths across the country. A child with the virus was hospitalized but is now at home and doing well. Cases of enterovirus D-68 have also been reported in Alameda, Contra Costa, Santa Cruz, Solano and San Francisco counties -- mostly among children. The San Francisco Department of Public Health says it's testing for more potential cases after confirming its 1st case of the virus last week [week ending 5 Oct 2014].

Enterovirus 68 typically causes mild symptoms such as fever, cough, runny nose, sneezing and body aches, although more severe symptoms can include wheezing and difficulty breathing. Children and teens are more likely to fall ill from the virus and children with asthma may suffer more serious symptoms, according to county health officials.

There is no vaccine or any specific treatment other than management of symptoms, health officials said.

4 cases of EV-D68 have been confirmed in Lubbock County, Texas
--------------------------------------------------------------
Four cases of enterovirus D68, also known as EV-D68, have been lab-confirmed in Lubbock County, according to a Texas Department of State Health Services representative for region one. No other cases have been reported in the region outside of Lubbock County. Two cases were confirmed earlier this week and another 2 were confirmed later. The cases were school-age children. Beckie Brawley, public health coordinator for the City of Lubbock Health Department, said those cases were reported in school-age children. "We are just doing this for surveillance purposes," an official said. "We're not investigating these cases. We don't have any specifics. We don't know their age. They were admitted, they were tested and they were positive." Dr. David Gray, pediatrician with Covenant Medical Group, said the common symptoms reported include runny nose, cough and allergy-like symptoms. "That's the problem with enteroviruses," he said. "The majority of kids with enterovirus [infections] don't run fever. It looks ... like allergies.... It can be sneaky." Brawley said kids with underlying respiratory issues like asthma tend to have more severe symptoms. Adults are not immune, she said.

"What the CDC (Centers for Disease Control) is saying is most adults have already been exposed to it," Brawley said. "They may get the virus, but they're not going to have the severe symptoms like the kids are having." Other symptoms to look out for include rapid breathing, difficulty breathing or chest pain in older kids, Gray said. "If we see any of that, we definitely want the kiddos to be evaluated by their pediatrician," he said.

"The concern was raised in the summer," he said of EV-D68. "There were 2 clusters of illness that were unusual -- one in Chicago and one in Kansas City. It was a really sort of intense cluster of cases. A lot of children were showing up in the hospital with respiratory symptoms around the same time. That caused concern because that was unusual. That sort of sounded the alarm and started people looking for the virus. We haven't seen that sort of thing in Texas, but we have seen cases." 14 have been lab-confirmed so far, he said.

After exposure, the incubation period for symptoms is usually between 3 to 10 days, Gray said. Summer and fall are a peak time for enteroviruses, Northcott said. The necessity of lab confirmation to distinguish between EV-D68 and other enteroviruses makes it impossible to tell how many more will be seen throughout this season, Northcott said. Northcott said: "It changes regularly. By the time you put it out there, the number is likely to be different."

Decline in case numbers?
------------------------
While the nationwide outbreak of enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) cases may be starting to subside, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is still in the early stages of investigating it and determining whether it's connected to unexplained neurologic illnesses in children in Colorado and elsewhere, says a top CDC virology expert. Today [10 Oct 2014] the count of confirmed cases rose by 13, to 691, according to the CDC. The illnesses have been confirmed in all but 4 states: Alaska, Hawaii, Nevada, and Arizona. The cases confirmed yesterday [9 Oct 2014] and today mark a slowdown from earlier this week and much of last week. "We're getting a sense that on average there's at least an indication of a decline in the number of cases," Mark Pallansch, PhD, director of the CDC's Division of Viral Diseases, told CIDRAP News today. The respiratory illnesses have surfaced over the past 2 months, starting with clusters in Kansas City, Missouri, and Chicago [Illinois]. Almost all have been in children, many of them with a history of asthma or wheezing, and many cases have involved serious breathing difficulty. Five children infected with EV-D68 have died. The CDC says the role of the virus in the deaths is not clear, though health officials in New Jersey recently blamed the death of a 4-year-old boy on the pathogen. Complicating the picture further are reports of unexplained neurologic illnesses with leg weakness in children in several states, some of whom were infected with EV-D68. At least 10 children at Children's Hospital Colorado experienced those puzzling illnesses, and 4 of them tested positive for the virus.

EVD-68 was 1st identified in 1962 but has been relatively rare in the United States until now. It falls in the category of non-polio enteroviruses, which cause 10 million to 15 million infections each year in the United States, the CDC says. Most of the infections cause no symptoms or only a mild illness like the common cold, but some cases can be severe and lead to paralysis or other serious outcomes. Pallansch said the CDC is mounting 2 separate investigations related to EV-D68. One aims to determine the outbreak's geographic extent, which now includes most of the nation, and to discover the full spectrum of illness.

"The original reports and testing have focused almost exclusively on the most severely ill," he said. "Were trying to identify potential studies that might be possible to establish a broader spectrum of illness. All enteroviruses have a very broad spectrum of illness from asymptomatic to mild upper respiratory [to severe]. Is the current outbreak reflecting the typical enterovirus clinical pattern?"

The other investigation focuses on the unexplained neurologic illnesses, with the aim of figuring out why the Colorado cluster occurred and whether there are other clusters of similar cases elsewhere in the nation, Pallansch said. In late September [2014] the agency sent out a nationwide health alert asking for reports of such cases. "We fully expect what we know are sporadic cases that occur every year from multiple causes including other enteroviruses, and we're trying to find out if there are other clusters with a similar clinical picture," he said. "We hope to address the different potential causes of these clusters."

Two days ago [8 Oct 2014] the CDC reported identifying 17 cases in 12 states that meet its narrow case definition, involving unexplained limb weakness in patients under age 21 that began on or after [1 Aug 2014], with lesions in the gray matter of the spinal cord seen on MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). "We don't have an answer yet on whether there are other clusters besides in Colorado," Pallansch said. Noting that dozens of reported cases are in the pipeline awaiting evaluation." He said it is not yet known how many of the 17 cases that meet the definition also involved EV-D68 infections, commenting, "We have only fragmentary lab data at this time," and efforts to piece it together are still under way.

CDC efforts also have included genetic studies of the virus. Pallansch said 3 different strains have been identified in the outbreak, one of which is more common than the others. Seven genomic sequences representing the 3 strains were deposited in GenBank on [6 Oct 2014]. It remains unknown whether EV-D68 is a factor in the neurologic illnesses. "We still do not have an established link that these isolates are causing the paralytic disease," he said. He also said he had no new information on whether or how EV-D68 contributed to the 5 deaths.

[While it may be true that the EV-D68 case numbers may be beginning to decline according to current CDC analyses, a correlation between EV-D68 virus infection and occurrence of a low frequency poliomyelitis-like disease remains unresolved. In particular, the federal health agency reports EV-D68 has been detected in specimens from 5 patients in Colorado who died and had samples submitted for testing. State and local officials now have the authority to determine the cause of death, including the role that EV-D68 may have played. They also have the authority to determine the appropriate information to release, and the time to release it.

Additional complicating information is that initial sequencing of the genomes of EV-D68 virus isolates from patients has revealed an as yet unquantified degree of genetic heterogeneity. Further information is awaited. So far there have been no reports of EV-D68 virus anywhere outside of North America. - Mod.CP
