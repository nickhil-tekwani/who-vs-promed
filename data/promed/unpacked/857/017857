Skin disease spread in Grand Cape Mount County
----------------------------------------------
As the wild spread of the contagious skin disease takes over the city of
Robertsport in Grand Cape Mount County [Liberia] the Ministry of Health and
Social Welfare has warned people with the disease to cease all movement to
avoid spreading the disease.

A recent visit by this paper to the county observed that the number of
victims has increased. Latest report has it that over 75 people are
infected with the skin disease. Liberia's deputy chief medical Officer Dr
Moses Pewu told "The Inquirer" that research done to determine the cause of
the disease at the Liberia Biological and Medical Research Center in
Margibi County shows, that the disease is caused by a fly called "Nairobi fly".

They said the disease was first discovered in Kenya in the city of Nairobi
and it was how the name Nairobi fly was given to it. Liberia is the 3rd
country to report the outbreak of the disease. It is reported that it was
once reported in Sierra Leone. Dr Pewu advised that to manage the wide
spread of the disease residents should consider strongly good health practices.
