The Health Ministry has asked the people in Sabah to adhere to the
Fisheries Department's advice not to fish or consume shellfish or swim in
"red tide" areas.
Minister Datuk Chua Jui Meng said this was because his ministry was
concerned over any possible toxins following the red tides which were
detected in nine areas in Sabah. "I have given instructions to the director
of Food Division at the Ministry of Health to take samples of various types
of seafood from markets to analyze the toxins caused by the red tide," he said.
Red tide is an occasional natural phenomenon where micro organisms,
naturally living in the sea, undergo a population expansion.
He said 2 people died in Sabah after eating shellfish [that were
contaminated by these toxins in the 1980s. "These toxic substance can cause
food poisoning, vomiting and diarrhea." In some cases, it can even affect
the central nervous system," he said. He said the Fisheries Department had
put up signboards at the affected areas. Chua said the department had come
out with a list of seafood safe for consumption for the convenience of the
people in these areas.
"It is normally shellfish affected because they filter these plankton. The
toxin in their system contaminates people who consume them," he added.
Sabah Fisheries Department director Rayner Datuk Stuel Galid advised the
public against consuming shellfish such as oysters, mussels, cockles and
clam as well as the type of fish known as tamban.
The alert was issued due to the prevalence of toxin in samples tested so
far from many parts of Sabah including from Kota Kinabalu, Kuala Penyu,
Beaufort, Papar, Kudat, Sandakan, Tawau, Kunak and Lahad Datu. The types of
seafood considered safe for consumption are all types of prawns, lobsters,
shrimps, all types of coral fish and predatory fish such as sharks,
stingrays, barracuda, tenggiri and deep sea fishes.
