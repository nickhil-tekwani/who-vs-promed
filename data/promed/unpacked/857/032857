FAO WRLFMD Genotyping Report, IAH-P-EP-MEG-FOR-005-3, Saudi Arabia, 19 Nov 2013, Batch: WRLFMD/2013/00023, 3 samples, FMDV type O
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Country: Saudi Arabia
Period: 2013
No of samples: 3 [WRLFMD ref nos: SAU/1/2013 (hence "Ref 1"). SAU/3/2013 (hence "Ref 3"), and SAU/4/2013 (hence "Ref 4"):
BATCH: WRLFMD/2013/00023
Serotype: O
Species: cattle
Location: not given, Saudi Arabia
Date collected: 7 Aug 2013
Date received by WRLFMD: 7 Nov 2013
Date received for sequencing: 18 Nov 2013
Report date: 19 Nov 2013
Reported by: NJ Knowles
Checked by: K Bachanek-Bankowska
Topotype: ME-SA
Genotype/strain: Ind-2001KAR-13

Most closely related (non-Saudi) viruses:
Sample / virus name / percent identity / percent difference / topotype / strain
Ref "1" / "O/LIB/1/2013" / 98.12 / 1.88 / ME-SA / Ind-2001KAR-13
Ref "3" / "O/LIB/1/2013" / 98.28 / 1.72 / ME-SA / Ind-2001KAR-13
Ref "4" / "O/LIB/1/2013" / 98.28 / 1.72 / ME-SA / Ind-2001KAR-13

Most closely related reference virus:
Sample / virus name / percent identity / percent difference / topotype/strain
Ref "1" / "O/BHU/1/2013" / 96.71 / 3.29 / ME-SA / Ind-2001KAR-13
Ref "3" / "O/BHU/1/2013" / 96.87 / 3.13 / ME-SA / Ind-2001KAR-13
Ref "4" / "O/BHU/1/2013" / 96.87 / 3.13 / ME-SA / Ind-2001KAR-13

For all 3 Saudi FMD-O strains, the 2nd closely related reference virus was found to be BHU09-03 (topotype ME-SA, strain Ind-2001d).

[According to the genotyping details above, which have now become public after obtaining the consent for publication from the Saudi authorities, the Saudi isolates are closely related to the recent strain circulating in Libya. The virus recently isolated from Libya was shown to have a high homology with the FMD serotype O Ind-2001 (Karnataka 2013) strain. WRLFMD has included in the report above an additional report by Project Directorate on Foot-and-Mouth Disease (ICAR), Mukteswar, India, issued 21 Nov 2013, titled "Phylogenetic report on FMDV serotype O in Saudi Arabia in 2013" with the following data:

Most closely related viruses:
Strain / Close sequence / place of origin / nucleotide sequence identity (VPI) / topotype / lineage-strain
"O/SAU/1/2013" / "IND179/2013(379)" / Karnataka / 98.6 percent / ME-SA / Ind2001 KAR-13
"O/SAU/1/2013"/ "IND142/2013(311)" / Karnataka / 98.9 percent/ ME-SA / Ind2001 KAR-13
(See at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2013/PD-FMD%20Genotyping%20report%20-%20Saudi%20Arabia%202013.pdf).

The genetic relationship between other FMDV serotype O strains, currently circulating in the Middle-East/North Africa, and the Libyan, Saudi, and Indian strains belonging to the "Ind2001 KAR-13" lineage, deserve to be examined and clarified.

According to media reports, mass vaccinations against FMDV, including FMDV-O, are currently being applied in Lebanon and Libya. Information on the vaccine strains applied in those countries will be useful.

FMDV serotype O has been recently reported also from Israel (Golan, on the Syrian/Lebanese border) and from the Palestinian Authority's West Bank (Jericho, adjacent to the Jordanian border). Hopefully, samples have been submitted to the WRLFMD for genotyping. Results may assist in identifying the route(s) of introduction and in the selection of the most suitable vaccines. The situation in Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan deserves attention.

Information from Saudi Arabia on the local FMD situation, the affected locations (including the source of the genotyped samples), the suspected route of introduction, and control measures undertaken, will be appreciated. - Mod.AS]
