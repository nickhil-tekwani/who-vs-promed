[Greece reported in January 2017, a total of 3 outbreaks of sheep pox in the same area where the currents outbreaks are located. The event summary and interactive map can be seen at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=22343

The current report addresses 2 affected flocks in the island of Lesvos [Lesbos, in the northern Aegean Sea]: one, composed of sheep and goats; the other one includes sheep only.

The report does not differentiate between the epidemiological statistics of the 2 species. Such differentiation was absent also in the previous OIE report on the same disease in Lesvos, in January 2017, leading ProMED-mail to post a request for information. In response, we were informed by an EpiCore Global Surveillance Project member that the disease was restricted to the sheep; goats remained clinically unaffected.

It is known that most "sheep pox and goat pox" strains cause clinical disease in either sheep or goats, while some strains are equally pathogenic in both species. In an earlier epizootic (2013-2014), the Greek OIE report commendably differentiated between the epidemiological statistics of the 2 species (sheep, goats), even in mixed flocks. The strain caused disease in sheep only. It is highly probable that the current event is caused, similarly to the 2 previous events, by a specific sheep-affecting capripoxvirus. Confirmation or otherwise will be appreciated.

Such information may have epidemiological implications and is helpful for control policy and when vaccination is considered. - Mods.AS/CRD
