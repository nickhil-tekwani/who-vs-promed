[1] Aerosols and virus stability
Date: Wed 7 Apr 2021

The deactivating effects of heat and sunlight on SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, are consistent across different variants of the virus, according to new research from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate (S&T). This suggests that the increased transmissibility of certain variants is not due to any difference in environmental survivability in aerosols.

The research, conducted under S&T's Probabilistic Analysis for National Threats Hazards and Risks (PANTHR) program, is published in the peer-reviewed scientific Journal of Infectious Diseases.

Key findings:
- Decay rates of infectious virus are strongly affected by simulated sunlight.
- Temperature and relative humidity have a smaller influence on decay rate.
- No differences were observed between isolates without simulated sunlight.
- A slight difference was observed between some isolates in simulated sunlight.
- Results suggest decay rates do not vary greatly among currently circulating variants.

"There is still a lot for scientists to learn about SARS-CoV-2, the variants that have emerged, and what contributes to their transmission in the community," said Dr. Lloyd Hough, lead for S&T's Hazard Awareness & Characterization Technology Center (HAC-TC). "But this research shows that the stability of these variants in the environment is about the same, and that the risk assessments and tools that S&T produced early in the pandemic are still applicable."

Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center (NBACC) in Fort Detrick, MD, examined the influence of environmental conditions on the stability of a single isolate of SARS-CoV-2. As new strains of the virus emerged, NBACC researchers began studying isolates from multiple variants (including one belonging to the recently emerged B.1.1.7 lineage, also known as the UK variant), to determine whether there were differences in stability of the variants in aerosols that might affect their potential for transmission.

The influence of temperature, relative humidity, and simulated sunlight on the isolates in aerosols were compared in an environmentally controlled rotating drum chamber. Aerosols were generated from simulated respiratory tract lining fluid to represent aerosols originating from the deep lung. The researchers determined that while certain variants may spread faster or be more lethal, they survive similarly in the environment, and therefore differences in transmissibility are likely not due to differences in aerosol stability.

[It is important to understand the effect of simulated sunlight, relative humidity, and suspension matrix on stability of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols, and whether the more transmissible variants have greater stability. "From the point of view of infectious disease transmission, an aerosol is a particle of saliva or respiratory fluid that floats in the air and that infects us when we breathe it in. That's different from a droplet, which is a projectile that infects by hitting us on the eyes, nostrils, or mouth. People generate particles of many sizes when they cough, talk, or sing. When we talk, particles above about 300 Amicro-m are droplets because they have enough inertia to do this projectile-like ballistic impaction. When coughing or sneezing we exhale more forcefully, so smaller particles may act like droplets, and in those situations 100 Amicro-m may be a better threshold. Particles larger than that can impact like a droplet. At 100 Amicro-m in diameter and below, the particles are aerosols and they can only infect by inhalation."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COVID-19 is a disease with unique characteristics including lung thrombosis (1) , frequent diarrhoea (2) , abnormal activation of the inflammatory response (3) and rapid deterioration of lung function consistent with alveolar oedema (4) . The pathological substrate for these findings remains elusive. Here we show that the lungs of patients with COVID-19 contain infected pneumocytes with abnormal morphology and frequent multinucleation. Generation of these syncytia results from activation of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein at the cell plasma membrane level. Based on these observations, we performed 2 high-content microscopy-based screenings with over 3000 approved drugs to search for inhibitors of Spike-driven syncytia. We converged on the identification of 83 drugs that inhibited Spike-mediated cell fusion, several of which belonged to defined pharmacological classes. We focused our attention on effective drugs that also protected against virus replication and associated [cytopathic effect]. One of the most effective molecules was Niclosamide, which markedly blunted calcium oscillations and membrane conductances in Spike-expressing cells by suppressing the activity of TMEM16F/Anoctamin6, a calcium-activated ion channel and scramblase responsible for phosphatidylserine exposure on the cell surface. These findings suggest a potential mechanism for COVID-19 disease pathogenesis and support the repurposing of Niclosamide for therapy.

..., Niclosamide is a synthetic salicylanilide developed in the 1950s as a molluscicide against snails (42) and later approved in humans against tapeworm infection (43). Niclosamide has already been reported to be active against various enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 (44). Although this drug has relatively low solubility, there is evidence of considerable absorption, with serum levels that can reach 1-20 AmicroM (45,46). Together, our findings provide a mechanism and a rationale for repurposing of Niclosamide to treat patients with COVID-19.

The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) first emerged in late December 2019 in Wuhan, China. Though it has been more than one year since the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was reported, it is still unclear how long the antibodies persist in those who have recovered.

Researchers at Sinopharm Wuhan Plasma-derived Biotherapies Co., Ltd and Wuhan Institute of Biological Products Co. Ltd, showed a positive rate of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody against the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein (RBD-IgG) to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors exceeded 70% for 12 months after infection.

The team also noted in the study, which appeared on the pre-print server bioRxiv, that the RBD-IgG kinetics displayed a downward trend, with the titer starting to stabilize after 9 months and dropped by 68.1% compared with the 1st month.

Study background
----------------
It has been a long-standing question of how long people who recovered from COVID-19 are protected from reinfection. Several SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been approved worldwide, but it remains unclear how long these vaccines protect against infection. The durability of the immune response, particularly humoral immune response, induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection is essential to understand the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and predict the longevity of its vaccine protection.

In infected patients with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which caused an outbreak in 2002, the specific antibodies against the virus can last for an average of 2 years, with the positive rate and titer of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1)-specific neutralizing antibodies markedly reduced at the 3rd year.

Hence, SARS patients may become vulnerable to the same virus 3 years after recovering from the infection. This highlights the importance of assessing the humoral immune response's durability to the current spreading virus, the SARS-CoV-2.

The study
---------
To arrive at the humoral immune response duration in convalescent COVID-19 patients, the researchers performed a 12-month longitudinal study by collecting 1782 plasma samples from 869 convalescent plasma donors in Wuhan City, China. The team also tested specific antibody responses.
They found that the positive rate IgG antibody against the receptor-binding domain of spike protein to SARS-CoV-2 in the COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors surpassed 70% for 12 months after infection. This means that the RBD-IgG response in more than 70% of COVID-19 convalescent patients could last for about a year, showing that vaccination can help limit the virus's spread.

The RBD-IgG titer dropped by 69.86% in the 1st year compared with the 1st month's titer. The proportion of the plasma donors whose RBD-IgG titers remained above the moderate titer at the later stages after being diagnosed was 27.2%. The team also noted that though the RBD-IgG titer slowly decreased over time within the 1st year, the RBD-IgG became stable at 9 months.

Moreover, the researchers evaluated the RBD-IgG stability with various titers based on the titer value early after diagnosis. Even if more rapid attenuation of RBD-IgG was observed in the plasma donors with elevated titers, after some time, the RBD-IgG in plasma donors with high titers remained higher than those with lower titers.

Consecutively, the team revealed that the RBD-IgG titers markedly increased in 11.67% of low-titer patients and 1.87% of the moderate-titer population at 10 and 11 months. This could be attributed to the delayed seroconversion in a small number of plasma donors.

The RBD-IgG titers of male plasma donors are higher than those of female plasma donors at the early phase of infection. Meanwhile, the elderly might develop antibody response against SARS-CoV-2, as age is positively correlated with the RBD-IgG titers.

"Furthermore, we confirmed the positive association between RBD-IgG and neutralizing antibody titers," the team note in the study.

"Overall, this study provides strong long-term support for the duration of protection by neutralizing antibodies in COVID-19 plasma donors, indicates the potential to prevent SARS-CoV-2 reinfection, and illustrates the role of neutralizing antibodies in clinical research and development evaluation of vaccines," the team added.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To the Editor:

Interim results from a phase 3 trial of the Moderna mRNA-1273 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine indicated 94% efficacy in preventing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The durability of protection is currently unknown. We describe mRNA1273-elicited binding and neutralizing antibodies in 33 healthy adult participants in an ongoing phase 1 trial, stratified according to age, at 180 days after the 2nd dose of 100 micro-g (day 209).

Antibody activity remained high in all age groups at day 209. Binding antibodies, measured by means of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay against SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain, had geometric mean end-point titers (GMTs) of 92 451 (95% confidence interval [CI], 57 148 to 149 562) in participants 18 to 55 years of age, 62 424 (95% CI, 36,765 to 105 990) in those 56 to 70 years of age, and 49 373 (95% CI, 25,171 to 96 849) in those 71 years of age or older. Nearly all participants had detectable activity in a pseudovirus neutralization assay, with 50% inhibitory dilution (ID50) GMTs of 80 (95% CI, 40 to 135), 57 (95% CI, 30 to 106), and 59 (95% CI, 29 to 121), respectively. On the more sensitive live-virus focus-reduction neutralization mNeonGreen test, all the participants had detectable activity, with ID50 GMTs of 406 (95% CI, 286 to 578), 171 (95% CI, 95 to 307), and 131 (95% CI, 69 to 251), respectively; these GMTs were lower in participants 56 to 70 years of age (P=0.02) and in those 71 years of age or older (P=0.004) than in those 18 to 55 years of age (Figure 1; also see the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter [at the source URL above]).

The estimated half-life of binding antibodies after day 43 for all the participants was 52 days (95% CI, 46 to 58) calculated with the use of an exponential decay model, which assumes a steady decay rate over time, and 109 days (95% CI, 92 to 136) calculated with the use of a power-law model (at day 119), which assumes that decay rates decrease over time. The neutralizing antibody half-life estimates in the 2 models were 69 days (95% CI, 61 to 76) and 173 days (95% CI, 144 to 225) for pseudovirus neutralization and 68 days (95% CI, 61 to 75) and 202 days (95% CI, 159 to 272) for live-virus neutralization. As measured by change in Akaike information criterion, corrected for small sample size, the best fit for binding and neutralization were the exponential decay and power-law models, respectively (see the Supplementary Appendix). These results are consistent with published observations of convalescent patients with COVID-19 through 8 months after symptom onset.

Although the antibody titers and assays that best correlate with vaccine efficacy are not currently known, antibodies that were elicited by mRNA-1273 persisted through 6 months after the 2nd dose, as detected by 3 distinct serologic assays. Ongoing studies are monitoring immune responses beyond 6 months as well as determining the effect of a booster dose to extend the duration and breadth of activity against emerging viral variants. Our data show antibody persistence and thus support the use of this vaccine in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic.

[Duration of immunity following vaccination for COVID-19 is an unanswered question since the earliest vaccinees are less than a year out. This report, though in a small number of individuals, suggests durable antibody responses following vaccination with Moderna's mRNA vaccine with robust antibody including high neutralization titers at 6 months after the 2nd dose. While the level of antibody required for protection is not known (and indeed protection likely also involves cell-mediated immune responses), the slow decay of antibody suggests that immunity is likely to persist for a reasonable period of time. Similarly, the duration of immunity following natural infection is not completely understood, though reinfection appears rare even in those infected more than a year ago. This is encouraging news, though studies of boosting and of clinical protection, including against variants, need to be performed. - Mod.LM]
