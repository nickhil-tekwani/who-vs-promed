Hong Kong: 2 more infected in mystery outbreak at care center
-------------------------------------------------------------
The virus or bacteria that caused a mystery outbreak among children at the
Caritas Medical Centre is unlikely to be new, although it has yet to be
identified, says health chief York Chow. 2 more children have developed
fever and respiratory illness, bringing to 30 the number infected. A total
of 18 boys and 12 girls -- aged 4 to 17 -- are being treated. They are all
isolated in ward 9B, except for one, who was earlier admitted to the
intensive care unit for an "unrelated disease" and remains in a serious
condition, a hospital spokeswoman said. Claiming privacy concerns, she
refused to reveal the reason for the admission, but confirmed it was not
SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome).
The "green" code warning is being maintained, meaning that an infection is
spreading in a ward in the hospital. No staff have been affected. Chow said
that, although culture tests have not yet been concluded, and quick tests
have ruled out SARS or common influenza, he does not believe it is a new
virus. "We have not confirmed [the cause of infection]," he said. "We
believe it is not a new virus, but an existing one which targets children
with weakened immune systems."
He reminded the public to take care, as the flu season is approaching, and
suggests children who have fever or respiratory illness avoid school.
Centre for Health Protection (CHP) consultant Thomas Tsang said he believes
the peak of the infection has passed, but added that more children could
fall ill before the outbreak ends. Contact tracing of teachers, medical
staff, and parents has been conducted, and there is no sign others have
been infected. "We believe this infection, unlike SARS, will not spread
into the community," Tsang said. "Quick tests have ruled out SARS or
influenza; genetic tests being conducted will conclude in one or 2 days."
Both the CHP and Hospital Authority agree that there is no community
outbreak in this incident. The authority's senior executive manager, Liu
Shao-haei, said control measures are sufficiently in place. Authority chief
executive William Ho said that, with the 2 new cases, 6 patients still
displayed signs of fever. "Hopefully, their condition will improve
eventually, but we must stay on guard," he said. "The new measures imposed
[on Mon 15 Nov] are well executed. A hotline has been set up for families
of the children to contact the hospital to help facilitate communication
between them. Visitors are not encouraged, but those who insist on coming
are required to wear full protective gear, such as gown and face mask,
before entering the ward."
