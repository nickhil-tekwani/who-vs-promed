Big Horn Sheep draw wildlife watchers in and around Yellowstone all year long. They're most easily seen in the winter, and spring. But tourists travelling to and from Gardiner from Mammoth see them most of the year. And Horn Sheep hunters prize these animals, often waiting years for a hunting tag in Montana or Wyoming. A Big Horn Sheep die-off near Gardiner has closed hunting there.

"The Gardiner herd, it's hunt district 305 in Montana. By Montana Fish Wildlife and Parks estimates maybe 40 percent of that herd has gone away." Wild Sheep Foundation biologist Kevin Hurley says the die-off was caused by pneumonia, possibly passed to the herd by a 2-year-old domestic sheep operation nearby.

"I personally observed contact on Thanksgiving morning a year and a half ago. A young big horn ram that ran down and bebopped off the hill and jumped the fence. Got in with a couple dozen domestics."

Wyoming's Game and Fish Department has worked hard to bring wild sheep back to areas like the Big Horn Mountains, which lost most of its big horns to disease years ago. But, Hurley says a group of sheep growers works with Game and Fish, and others, to work out the disease problem in this state.

"Stakeholders that are interested in wild sheep and domestic sheep, we've agreed to work together but to stay out of each other's way."

Hurley wants to put together a similar group in the Gardiner area. He's contacted the Montana's Fish Wildlife and Parks biologist, to try to get a discussion started.

"We're certainly willing to participate. Our Montana Wild Sheep Foundation is willing to participate and be a catalyst for that discussion."

Hurley says the foundation sometimes pays growers to quit raising sheep. And, he says those discussions have occurred in the Gardiner area, but are not successful now.

[Bighorn sheep pneumonia has traditionally been considered a multifactorial disease, caused by multiple pathogens. Due to their complexity, understanding multifactorial phenomena usually requires integrated and sustained research efforts. The absence of established and universal explanations for pneumonia outbreaks contributes to conflict among wildlife and livestock stakeholders over land use and management practices.

The web of causation for Bighorn sheep pneumonia may have an important environmental component. In recent years, die-offs of bighorn sheep in several locations suggest that the proximate cause of these events may be a shared environmental determinant.

However, recent evidence indicates that in northwestern USA there seems to be a pathogen implicated in bighorn sheep outbreaks, _Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae_, an exotic disease agent for North America, introduced by domestic ovids.
