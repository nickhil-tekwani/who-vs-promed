[Again, as mentioned in previous postings, another horse that
shouldn't have been infected will be euthanized and another disease
investigation that shouldn't have had to be mounted, will cost
resources. The French animal health authorities are to be
congratulated for finding this animal before clinical signs developed
and for their ongoing surveillance. There clearly is a possibility
that we will continue to find more cases stemming from the illegal
export of horses from Romania in 2007.
