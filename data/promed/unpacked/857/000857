[Epidemiological Week 12 was 22-28 March 2015.

See p. 247, Tabla 2, column "Fiebre amarilla selvatica."b - Mod.JW]

[The yellow fever (YF) virus infections were reported as sylvan transmission cycle occurrences and not acquired in urban settings. The epidemiological bulletin covers the period in 2015 up to epidemiological week 12 ending 28 Mar 2015. No details of these cases are provided other than the numbers of cases by region. ProMED would appreciate receiving additional information including specific dates when the cases occurred, their sex and ages and outcome of the infection as well as any occurrence of infected monkeys. YF virus is endemic in the tropical areas of South America including the Amazon Basin of Peru, where sporadic cases occur. There were cases there in 2013 and 2014 (see archives listed below).
