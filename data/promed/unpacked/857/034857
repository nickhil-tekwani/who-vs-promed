The CDC found that hepatitis E is an "emerging foodborne pathogen" that is transmitted to humans through raw or undercooked pork products. According to the study, "40 percent of U.S. slaughterhouse pigs (sampled) were seropositive for HEV (hepatitis E virus), indicating prior HEV infection of the pigs on the farms, which was consistent with prior estimates for farmed U.S. pigs." This means hepatitis E could enter our food chain.

The scientists took 23 000 samples from pigs in 25 slaughterhouses around the USA. "We previously showed that HEV-3 is present in U.S. swine herds and that a small proportion of commercial pork products, such as liver and chitterlings, from American grocery stores contain infectious HEV."

Scientists do not have a vaccine available for hepatitis E, and the CDC reports that symptoms can take up to 60 days to develop after exposure. Scientists report that while the entry point to the food chain "remains unknown," the possibility is there.

Some symptoms of hepatitis E include fever, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite and jaundice.

[While genotypes 1 and 2 of HEV cause outbreaks of the disease mostly from contaminated water in the developing world, genotypes 3-7 are zoonotic. GT 3 is primarily spread from swine and can cause chronic infection in immunosuppressed individuals and can be transmitted via blood transfusion. The following is an excellent paper regarding zoonotic HEV in the UK:

Said B, Usdin M, Warburton F, et al. Pork products associated with human infection caused by an emerging phylotype of hepatitis E virus in England and Wales. Epidemiol Infect. 2017; 145(12): 2417-23. doi: 10.1017/S0950268817001388. Epub 2017 Jul 31; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28756783

Abstract
--------
"Since 2010, human hepatitis E infections have increased in England and Wales. Most cases are locally acquired and caused by hepatitis E virus genotype 3 (HEV G3). HEV G3 is linked to the consumption of pork products. The increase is associated with the emergence of a new phylotype, HEV G3-group 2 (G3-2, also known as G3abcdhij). 60 individuals with confirmed hepatitis E infection and no history of travel outside the UK were recruited: 19 were infected with HEV G3-group 1 (G3-1 or G3efg) and 41 with G3-2. Epidemiological data relating to usual shopping habits and consumption of ham and sausages were analysed together with typing data to identify any associations with HEV phylotype. Study participants who purchased ham and/or sausage from a major supermarket were more likely to have HEV G3-2 infection (relative risks 1.85, P = 0·06, CI 0·97-3·53). The HEV G3-2 phylotype has not been detected in indigenous UK pigs and it is suggested that human infections could be the result of consumption of products made from pork originating outside the UK. This does not infer blame on the supermarket, but the epidemiology of HEV is dynamic and reflects complex animal husbandry practices which need to be explored further."

This report underscores the importance of zoonotic hepatitis E (primarily genotype 3) as the cause of hepatitis E emergence in Europe. There are currently 7 genotypes of HEV, and genotypes 1 and 2 are not zoonotic and cause most of the HEV infections in Africa and Asia. It is these genotypes that cause increased morbidity and mortality in pregnant women. Most of the zoonotic hepatitis E cases have been recognized in the developed world, are associated with foodborne disease (usually undercooked pork products), and are caused by genotype 3. In addition, infection with genotype 3 when occurring in immunocompromised hosts (especially solid organ transplant recipients) can cause chronic infection which can progress to cirrhosis. Ribavirin has been used to treat such individuals with chronic infection.

The author's summary of their work states: "Study participants who purchased ham and/or sausage from a major supermarket were more likely to have HEV G3-2 infection (relative risks 1.85, P = 0·06, CI 0·97-3·53)," although the posting above quotes the paper (in the full text, which is not available to this moderator) as "Only supermarket X, especially [its] own brand, was significantly associated with [the virus]." The statistics noted in the summary give a relative risk of 1.85, which supports an increased risk of almost 2 times, but the p value of 0.06 and a confidence interval overlapping 1.0 both do not reach statistical significance, so "more likely" is better than "significantly associated." Be that as it may, there is no doubt that acquisition of zoonotic HEV in Europe is clearly linked to ingestion of undercooked pork products that were carrying the virus. Adequate cooking and appropriate kitchen practices to avoid cross-contamination will minimize, if not erase totally, this risk. - Mod.LL
