CORRECTION: Eurosurveillance Weekly Botulism, wound, drug-related - UK, Ireland
------------------------
Re: Eurosurveillance Weekly: Thursday 31 October 2002. Volume 6, Issue 44
In yesterday's issue of Eurosurveillance Weekly [and covered in ProMED-mail
posting Botulism, wound, drug-related - UK, Ireland 20021031.5675], we
published a report entitled 'Cluster of wound botulism cases in injecting
drug users in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland'. This title
was misleading, as we were primarily reporting a cluster of 6 cases in
England which have been reported by the Public Health Laboratory Service
Food Safety Microbiology Laboratory in London since 1 Aug 2002. These are
in addition to 7 clinically diagnosed cases of wound botulism in injecting
drug users reported in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland in 2002.
The report has now been re-titled 'Cluster of wound botulism cases in
injecting drug users in England'
There was a report of one case of wound botulism in an injecting drug user
in Ireland this year that occurred in March, and has not been proven to be
related to the 6 cases in England since 1 Aug 2002 referred to in the
Eurosurveillance Weekly report of 31 Oct 2002.
