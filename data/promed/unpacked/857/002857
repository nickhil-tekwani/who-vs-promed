At least 200 sheep have died on South Australia's Eyre Peninsula, which is
experiencing its worst outbreak of lupinosis in 20 years. So far, 12 sheep
producers have reported deaths, with some cattle suffering symptoms as well.
Lupinosis is a fungal disease which grows on lupine stubble from last
year's crops and is believed to have flourished with a wetter than average
summer.

Lupinosis is caused by a mycotoxin produced by a fungus that grows on the
stubble animals graze upon. The fungus grows when the conditions are
correct -- generally warm moist conditions following summer rains. Lupines
are often raised as a cash crop in Australia, and it is customary for the
animals to graze the stubble.
Sheep are most often affected, but cattle, horses, and donkeys have also
been affected. Although goats may be affected and can be experimentally
infected, it is not the usual field condition to see affected goats.
Affected sheep have a depressed appetite, lag behind during gathering, and
are ataxic. Generally the mucous membranes in the mouth and eyes may be a
bit yellow, as the animals are often jaundiced. Death follows quickly from
this stage.
The article incorrectly indicates that sheep may get lupinosis from cattle.
Cattle may be affected by the same mycotoxin, but the mycotoxin must be
consumed by the animal; it is not transmitted between animals.
Treatment for affected animals is immediate withdrawal from fields
containing lupines. Good-quality hay (without lupines), access to shade,
rest, and clean water are important. Some veterinarians recommend other
measures depending upon severity. The livers of these animals are affected;
though the liver may regenerate, it is a slow process. - Mod.TG]
