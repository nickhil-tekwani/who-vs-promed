In view of the recent change in CDC guidelines regarding malaria
chemoprophylaxis for the Dominican Republic, we wish to report another
patient with falciparum malaria who was reproted today within our network
TropNetEurop. The case was reported by Martin Grobusch (M.D., M.Sc.,
DTM&H), from Berlin.
This 45-year-old male patient spent a fortnight holiday in a brand new 5
star beach resort named near Punta Cana from 28 Jan 2000 to 10 Feb 2000.
He decided not to take any malaria prophylaxis although he had heard about
the recent case cluster. He fell ill on day 13 after return with fever,
chills and headache and presented to a peripheral hospital in Berlin a few
days later as
reported where malaria was suspected by himself and his attending
physician. Slides were first prepared and screened in the local laboratory,
and a preliminary diagnosis of _Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria was
established which was confirmed later when the slides were reviewed later
by an expert microscopist (M.G.) at our institution to which the patient
was referred. The patient reported that the resort has still been
partiallly under construction, and that it has been built on the grounds of
a former village which was swept away by hurricane George.
Including this recent case, a total of 13 patients with falciparum malaria
acquired at the East coast of Dominican Republic have been reported within
TropNetEurop since 27 Nov 1999. Out of these, 10 patients came from
Germany, 2 from Spain, and one from Austria. Within TropNetEurop, we
continue to monitor the situation.

We received a report of this case yesterday [2 Mar 2000 through CDC-USA.
This hotel is located in "Cabeza de Toro" (bull head), not in Punta Cana,
although he probably arrived through Punta Cana airport, located about half
an hour by car from there. Cabeza de Toro is a small complex of three
or four hotels located outside the section of El Salado (Bavaro) where an
outbreak of malaria occurred last year. This locality, as any other in the
province of La Altagracia, has been under special active surveillance since
September 1999. No other cluster or outbreak of malaria has been
detected in this province.
According to surveillance information from Cabeza de Toro, no cases were
found in September, October or November [1999. One case was detected in
week 50 [1999, one case in week 1 [2000, one in week 2, no case in week 3
and one case in week 4. No cases were detected in weeks 5, 6, 7, and 8.
Three of these 4 cases have been in migrant workers from Haiti. All 4 cases
were detected during construction in the area. Although there is no
evidence of local transmission of malaria in this area, usual control
measures have been established.
All information shows a normal situation in this locality. It is also the
current situation in every locality in this and other provinces with
non-endemic transmission. That means that imported cases are quickly
identified and treated, local measures of prevention are adopted, and no
local transmission is established.
After the report of this case in a tourist, a specialized brigade was sent
there to reinforce the local team in order to have a more comprehensive
view of the local situation.
National authorities recommend that tourists use insect repellents applied
to the skin if they are going out of hotel facilities, especially at night,
and to use chemoprophylaxis if they are going to rural areas. Other
recommendations are to be alert and to seek medical care if they develop
fever during the stay in the country or during the next two weeks.
Chemoprophylaxis for tourists traveling to hotels in the east coast is
considered to be only an additional personal and voluntary precaution.
Chemoprophylaxis is recommended if they are planning to go to endemic
areas. These endemic areas affect only about 10% of the population and are
mainly located in the west of the country, near to the border of the other
country.
It may be useful to recall that more than one million tourists have already
come this year to these places (Bavaro, Punta Cana, Cabeza de Toro and
surrounding areas). Most of them have been Europeans.
Regarding the number of malaria cases reported to Tropnet Europe, could you
specify the cases by epidemiological week? It could be useful for us
and for ProMED-mail subscribers to see the recent trends.
