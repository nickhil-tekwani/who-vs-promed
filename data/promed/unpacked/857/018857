Emergence of Vancomycin-Resistant _E. faecium_ in Karachi, Pakistan
--------------------------------------------------
According to a study from Pakistan, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE)
has not been reported previously in Pakistan until
vancomycin-resistant _Enterococcus faecium_ was isolated from the clinical
specimens of 6 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and
neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of the Aga Khan University Hospital,
Karachi.
"To identify the extent of the outbreak, rectal swabs were obtained from
all the patients admitted to the ICU and NICU at that time. A total of 10
strains of vancomycin-resistant _Enterococcus faecium_ were isolated. All
the strains showed high-level resistance to both glycopeptides (vancomycin
and teicoplanin) with a vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration greater
than 256 mg/L. All isolates had the vanA gene detected by polymerase chain
reaction. The contour-clamped homogeneous electric field (CHEF) pattern
demonstrated that all but one of the isolates were of a single clone,
suggesting that they were derived from common source," stated E. Khan and
colleagues, Aga Khan University Hospital.
Khan and colleagues concluded: "Use of vancomycin and prolonged
hospitalization were common features in all cases investigated."
Khan and coauthors published the results of their study in the Journal of
Hospital Infection (Emergence of vancomycin-resistant _Enterococcus
faecium_ at a tertiary care hospital in Karachi, Pakistan. J Hosp Infect,
2002;52:292-296).
