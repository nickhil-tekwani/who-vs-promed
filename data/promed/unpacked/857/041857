2 Indonesian women who died from avian influenza earlier in November 2005
had no known contact with avian influenza virus-infected birds, said a
doctor at a hospital that treated one of the patients.
"It remains unclear how these 2 people contracted the disease," said Ilham
Patu, 47, a medical officer with Sulianti Saroso, one of 2 hospitals in
Jakarta designated to treat avian influenza cases. A government
investigation found that no fowl or other birds were infected with the
avian influenza virus near their homes, Patu said in an interview today.
The H5N1 virus has infected at least 130 people and killed 67 since
December 2003 in Viet Nam, China, Cambodia, Indonesia and Thailand, the
World Health Organization said yesterday. The deaths, and new poultry
infections in Viet Nam and China this week, heighten concern that the virus
may mutate into a strain more easily passed between humans, leading to a
pandemic that may kill millions.
The WHO laboratory in Hong Kong confirmed on Wed 16 Nov 2005 that the 2
Indonesian women died of H5N1 virus infection, taking the number of
confirmed cases in Indonesia to 11 [7 of which were fatal]. In about 80 per
cent of human cases, the infection was probably caused by direct contact
with sick or dying birds, Georg Petersen, WHO's representative in Jakarta,
said in an interview on 14 Nov 2005. "Then we are left with a group of
people where we don't know exactly how they got infected," Petersen said.
In cases where more than one person in a family became infected,
authorities may "know the source of one person, but not the others," he
said. Human-to-human transmission of the H5N1 avian flu virus is "not
proven and not disproved," Petersen said. "There is only one case published
from Thailand where human-to-human transmission is implicated," he said.
In Indonesia, 2 teenagers who had developed symptoms are undergoing tests
for the virus. Neither had been exposed to H5N1 infected chickens at their
homes, Patu said. 4 people in Indonesia confirmed to have contracted the
H5N1 strain have survived, Sari Setiogi, a World Health Organization
spokeswoman in Jakarta, said yesterday.

Chinese authorities have not shared samples of the [Chinese isolates of
the] H5N1 avian influenza virus uses with scientists outside the country
since the spring of 2004, leaving influenza experts worried that the world
has an incomplete picture of how the worrisome viruses are evolving.
With confirmation of human cases of H5N1 [virus] infection in China, the
need to look at a range of viral samples or isolates from that country has
taken on a heightened sense of urgency, officials say. "The new outbreaks
are coming hot and heavy now and we just don't know what's out there. We
don't know if it's the same virus or different viruses. And we need to get
that information," says Michael Perdue, a scientist with the World Health
Organization's global influenza program. "Thus far, we're in the dark."
The international agencies involved in trying to contain the spread of H5N1
have made a number of entreaties to China for virus samples and have
received assurances from authorities there that viruses will be shared.
Meanwhile, the human toll mounts. As of Fri 18 Nov 2005, the WHO had
confirmed 130 human cases in the current sustained outbreak, which began
nearly 2 years ago. Of those cases, 67 people have died. China has posted
the genetic sequences of a large number of H5N1 avian influenza viruses
isolated from birds in open-access databases; a step for which the agencies
and outside researchers are grateful. But only so much can be learned from
analyzing the genetic sequences of viruses. In order to determine whether
the lethality of the virus is changing and whether the current prototype
H5N1 vaccine would still be a good match, scientists have to be able to
study live viruses, experts say. "The sequence data gives us information on
the rate of change, and what biological properties are attributed to
certain parts of the genes," says Dr Juan Lubroth, head of the emergency
prevention system of the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization. "To be
able to study this virus through its genes is great. But what does it do
biologically? What does it do in the host? That is also very, very important."
Earl Brown, a virologist who specializes in the evolution of influenza
[virus] virulence, says there are limits to what can be learned from
studying genetic codes. "We don't know enough to interpret the biology;
that's the whole point," says Brown, who is based at the University of
Ottawa. He believes WHO ought to be entitled to [have] access to viral
samples when pathogens that pose a threat to human health emerge from
nature. "WHO should have some system. If virus is out there, identified,
they have a right to get it and they should have some repository it goes
to," Dr Brown insists.
Dr Lubroth says China's slowness to share viruses reflects a concern there
that the country's researchers do not receive adequate credit for their
scientific contribution. Dr Brown can understand that point of view, saying
scientists the world over hoard their data in order to ensure they get
credit for their findings, which is key to ensuring ongoing research
funding. "You don't give away your data because the big labs will take it,
they'll take the credit and you're sitting there writing a grant
application without having the work published yourself," he says.
Another concern has been voiced by several countries affected by H5N1
outbreaks. They know part of the reason the developed countries want access
to virus samples is to ensure that the seed strain for H5N1 vaccine is
up-to-date enough that the vaccine would be protective.
That rankles because these countries further understand that should H5N1
spark a human pandemic, their people stand little chance of getting access
to limited global supplies of vaccine. "Some of the developing countries
anticipate that they're going to be short-changed with that step," Dr
Lubroth admits. "So to convince . . . the countries that we're honest
brokers is not an easy process. And to get them to agree on a material
transfer agreement (for viruses) doesn't happen overnight."

[These reports highlight some unresolved questions.
Firstly, although the majority (but not all) of the human cases can be
related to contact with diseased poultry, the number of human cases of
illness must be a very small proportion of all contacts between humans and
diseased poultry. Other as-yet-unrecognized factors must be involved.
Secondly, nucleotide sequence analysis is useful in unravelling the
epidemiology of separate outbreaks. But sequence variation has to be
correlated with biological experiments to make predictions about the
imminence of changes in transmissibility and virus virulence. Mutations
tend to be deleterious unless there is some external selective pressure
favouring survival of a particular phenotype.
Thirdly, it is perhaps unfair to criticize the Chinese for not releasing
virus samples when there is counter-pressure to limit the distribution of
infectious virus to only a few approved laboratories with adequate
containment facilities. - Mod.CP]
