Outbreak of jaundice on the increase in Ufa
-------------------------------------------
An increased incidence of hepatitis A virus infection has been
observed in the city of Ufa since mid-April [2009]. During the past
week, from 11 to 17 May [2009], 27 cases of this type of hepatitis
have been diagnosed provisionally. According to the Bashkiria Branch
of Rospotrebnadzor [Federal Service for Consumer Affairs and Human
Welfare], since the beginning of May approximately 200 people have
been admitted to hospital suffering from hepatitis A. All of them
were infected in mid-April. In late April [2009] 17 employees of the
"Farmlend" network were hospitalized with the same diagnosis,
presumed to have been acquired during a gathering on [6 Mar 2009].

The last big increase in incidence of hepatitis A virus infection in
Bashkiria occurred in 2004, when there were 353 cases of the disease
(32.7 per 100 000 population). In 2008, 41 people in Ufa contracted
hepatitis A. In the 1st quarter of the current year [2009] 12 people
were affected in the capital of Bashkiria according to the
Rospotrebnadzor Office. According to the Regnum news agency the
number of cases of hepatitis A up to the end of the 1st quarter
[2009] did not exceed the average incidence.

Contacts of infected persons have been examined and vaccinated in
order to stabilize the incidence of hepatitis A. An inspection of the
tap water supply has been conducted (with negative results).
Producers of bottled water have been inspected and found to be
compliant with hygiene requirements for such enterprises. Unscheduled
supervisory inspections have been carried out in the city markets. An
epidemiological investigation is under way to determine the reason
for the increased incidence of hepatitis A virus infection in the
population of Ufa prior to the next cyclical upturn of infection.

[The source of the current outbreak has not been established, but
foodborne or personal contact, rather than waterborne infection seems likely.
