Huanglongbing (HLB) (ex-greening) is one of the most serious diseases of
citrus. The causal agent is a noncultured, sieve tube-restricted
a-proteobacterium, _Candidatus Liberibacter africanus_ in Africa and
_Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus_ in Asia (2). The disease has never been
reported from the American continent. However, _Diaphorina citri_, the
Asian psyllid vector of HLB, is found in South, Central, and North America
(Florida and Texas).
Early in 2004, leaf and fruit symptoms resembling those of HLB were
observed in several sweet orange orchards near the city of Araraquara, Sao
Paulo State. Leaf mottling on small and large leaves was the major symptom.
Shoots with affected leaves were yellowish. Fruits were small and lopsided,
contained many aborted seeds, and appeared more severely affected than were
plants infected with classic HLB.
43 symptomatic samples and 25 samples of symptomless sweet orange leaves
from 5 farms were analyzed for the presence of the HLB-liberibacters using
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with 2 sets of HLB-specific primers for
amplification of 16S rDNA (2,3) and ribosomal protein genes (1). None of
the 43 symptomatic leaf samples gave a positive PCR amplification, while
HLB-affected leaves from the Bordeaux HLB collection produced the
characteristic amplicons with both sets of primers.
The 43 symptomatic and the 25 symptomless leaf samples were then analyzed
using PCR with universal primers for amplification of bacterial 16S rDNA
(4). All symptomatic leaf samples, but none of the symptomless leaf
samples, yielded the same 16S rDNA amplification product, indicating the
presence of a bacterium in the symptomatic leaves. This was confirmed using
the observation of a sieve tube-restricted bacterium by electron microscopy.
The 16S-rDNA product was cloned, sequenced, and compared with those of _Ca.
L. africanus_ and _Ca. L. asiaticus_. While the 16S rDNAs of these 2
liberibacter species have 97.5 percent sequence identity, the 16S rDNA
sequence of the new bacterium shared only 93.7 percent identity with that
of _Ca. L. asiaticus_ and 93.9 percent with that of _Ca. L. africanus_. The
16S rDNA sequence of the new bacterium had a secondary loop structure
characteristic of the subdivision of the proteobacteria and possessed all
the oligonucleotide signatures characteristic of the liberibacters.
For these reasons, the new bacterium is a liberibacter and is sufficiently
different phylogenetically from known liberibacters to warrant a new
species, _Candidatus Liberibacter americanus_. Specific PCR primers for
amplification of the 16S rDNA of the new species have been developed. They
were able to detect _Ca. L. americanus_ in 214 symptomatic leaf samples
from 47 citrus farms in 35 municipalities, while the "old" species, _Ca. L.
asiaticus_, has been found only 4 times within the 47 farms.

[This new species of HLB appears to be well-established in Sao Paulo State.
I assume that scientists will be surveying other regions in Sao Paulo State
and other Brazilian states to determine the extent of its distribution in
the country and other countries in South America. Link:
