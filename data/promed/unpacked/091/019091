[This comment is in response to the report published in London Loves Business of 18 Sep 2014 (http://www.londonlovesbusiness.com/business-news/london-news/killer-mosquito-incursion-in-kent-could-sweep-across-britain/8876.article) and posted on ProMED-mail (archive no 20140921.2792363) on 21 Sep 2014. That report stated, "The mosquitos have spread across Europe in recent years, and have now been recorded in several locations in Kent.]

This is misleading information as no invasive _Aedes _mosquitoes have been found in the UK. There have been a number of news articles in British newspapers recently about invasive mosquitoes, reporting mainly on efforts to increase surveillance for _Aedes albopictus_, however no confirmed reports of any invasive _Aedes_ mosquito have been found during this surveillance, nor have any reports been submitted to the Medical Entomology group at Public Health England.

The reference to "invasive mosquitoes being found at several locations" in these articles probably relate to the new findings of _Culex modestus_ across North Kent (recently published in the Veterinary Record). This species is one of the principal vectors of West Nile virus in Europe but there is no evidence that transmission is occurring in the UK. The matter should not be confused with surveillance for invasive _Aedes_.

[ProMED-mail thanks Jolyon Medlock for comments that correct the implication that _Aedes albopictus_ have been found in Kent, when, in fact, they have not. The kind of systematic surveillance to detect the presence of invasive _Aedes_ mosquitoes, as is done by the Medlock group in the UK, is essential for assessing risk that the viruses that they can transmit efficiently could arrive in the UK as well with ongoing transmission.

One hopes that if invasive _Aedes_ mosquitoes are found in the UK in the future, aggressive efforts to eliminate them before they can become established, as they have in Italy and southern France, will be successful.
