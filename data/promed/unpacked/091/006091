On [27 Jul 2020] at about 10 a.m., the Bureau of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Services under the Guangfeng District Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureau sent a technical specialist and a veterinarian to a poor-household farm site. Upon investigation it was found that the disease suffered by cattle [at the farm] is Lumpy Skin Disease [LSD], and the condition was relatively serious.

To avoid risk of transmission to other cattle, technical personnel returned to the Y.J. household at 7:10 p.m. that night and vaccinated 12 heads of cattle that were still not sick and carried out antiviral treatment for the sick cattle. They then carried out disinfection of the cowshed to eliminate the risk of disease transmission.

To minimize the economic burden of the Y.J. household, the district Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureau decided that the treatment of Y.J.'s sick cattle would be provided free of charge.

[On Wed 29 Jul 2020, the OIE was informed by Dr. Huang Baoxu, Secretary of the Party Leadership Group, Animal Health and Epidemiology Centre, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Qingdao, China (People's Rep. of), about recent LSD outbreaks in 4 provinces in south-eastern China, namely Fujian, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Anhui (20200731.7628342). The 2 outbreaks reported from Jiangxi were located in the prefectural level cities of Ganzhou (starting date, 9 Jun 2020) and Fuzhou (starting date, 17 Jun 2010).

The new outbreak in a small cattle holding, described in the current media report, is located in a 3rd location of Jiangxi, namely Guangfeng (a district of the prefectural city of Shangrao). An administrative map of Jiangxi, where the 3 affected locations can be seen, is available at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiangxi#Administrative_divisions.

LSD seems to be spreading throughout several provinces in China; complementary information is expected to become available in follow-up reports and in the due, semiannual report to the OIE, covering the months January-June 2020.

Emergency vaccination is being practiced. - Mod.AS
