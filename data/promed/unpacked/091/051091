A new foot-and-mouth disease virus [FMDV] [serotype], Asia 1, has
infected at least 650 cows, buffaloes, pigs, and goats in the central
province of Quang Tri.
The provincial People's Committee reported on Wed 4 Jul 2007, that
the recent epidemic caused by the Asia 1 virus serotype, whose
origins are yet to be traced, had spread to the 5 districts of
Dakrong, Gio Linh, Trieu Phong, Cam Lo, and Huong Hoa.
The worst-hit area was Dakrong with over 470 out of 650 animals
contracting the disease.
Tests by the Animal Health Department have confirmed that the cattle
[were infected] by the Asia 1 serotype, and not the commonly known O
serotype.
Early last month [June 2007], 55 cows were transported from the
northern province of Thanh Hoa to Quang Tri by the local Thuan Thanh
Ltd. Company for a provincial poverty-elimination project.
Though the province's Agriculture and Rural Development Department
had advised the firm to quarantine the cattle for 15-21 days, the
company ignored the advice and distributed the animals to farmers.
The company claims that the animals had been inoculated against
foot-and-mouth and other diseases before being transported to Quang
Tri.
So far, the provincial authority has instructed relevant agencies to
quickly quarantine, sterilize infected cattle and areas, and control
the outbreak. Local inspection agencies have been tasked with
investigating the case further.
Nguyen Quang Vinh, head of the provincial animal health department,
said dealing with this virus type, which spreads fast, would cost
hundreds of thousands of dollars for the treatment and inoculation of
infected animals.
The provincial authority would allot some VND 7-8 billion (USD 434
000 - 496 000) to support affected farmers and stamp out the epidemic
by 10 Jul 2007.

[Viet Nam's declared plan to eradicate the disease in 4-5 days is
rather unrealistic.
FMD of serotype Asia 1 was reported by Viet Nam last time in May
2006. Reportedly, it was diagnosed in 19 communes located in 6
districts in Ha Giang province, adjacent to the Chinese border, and
affecting cattle, buffaloes, and pigs. No follow-up reports have
become available since. For assessment of Viet Nam's FMD situation,
please refer to the commentary in ProMED-mail 20070705.2133.
