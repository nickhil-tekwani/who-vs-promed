Symptoms of what is believed to be stem rust disease were found in untreated plots of winter wheat at 4 sites at Oak Park Crop Research Centre [of Agriculture and Food Development Authority Teagasc] in Carlow. Teagasc's Dr Steven Kildea says it is the 1st time he has seen the disease in the field in his 15-year career. "The disease that has been in Ireland before, however it is quite some time since it has been detected." The fact the disease was only found in untreated plots and in no commercial crops is good news, he adds.

Dr Diane Saunders, John Innes Centre [UK] says stem rust has been responsible for severe epidemics in western Europe, but not for a number of decades. "It was not of major concern, but the climate is becoming more unpredictable and it could potentially take off one year. The fact that the disease is rare and tends to only occur late in the season means it is not necessarily recorded or recognised. It would be useful to know of small infections."

[Wheat stem rust (_Puccinia graminis_, previously f.sp. _tritici_) has been reported to cause overall yield losses of up to 80 percent, but some fields are totally destroyed. Barley is also susceptible to this pathogen. Stem rust spores are spread by wind and with infected straw or other contaminated materials. The fungus can survive between seasons on some grasses or volunteer wheat generating a "green bridge". Alternatively, it can also produce hardy teliospores to infect members of the genus _Berberis_ (barberries) in the next season, which then serve as a source of crop inoculum. Disease monitoring is important so that timely action can be taken to limit the spread of the pathogen as well as build-up of inoculum. Disease management may include fungicide applications, control of volunteer wheat, and resistant varieties if available.

Races with increased virulence are emerging frequently and resistance breeding programmes have been set up by several countries and international groups. One of the most serious threats at present is considered to be the Ug99 family of strains (first discovered in Uganda in 1999), which have overcome the major resistance gene Sr31 used in our current wheat varieties. Additional resistance genes have been overcome by subsequent variants (see for example, ProMED-mail post 20100602.1834). New strains not related to Ug99 are also posing a danger, for example the Digalu strain with 2 distinct genotypes spreading in Europe and present in the UK (ProMED-mail post 20180219.5638265), for which variants with virulence to 4 additional host resistance genes have been identified.

Stem rust is currently being considered a re-emerging disease in Europe. After its long absence from the region, many wheat varieties planted there now are susceptible. In the UK, the teliospore host barberry has been planted increasingly as habitat for the endangered barberry carpet moth and is suspected to have given rise to a recent outbreak of stem rust in barley (ProMED-mail post 20191008.6714735).
