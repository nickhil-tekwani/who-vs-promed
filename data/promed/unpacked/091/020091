2000/173 Whitefly-transmitted viruses and whitefly species in Islas
Canarias, Spain [edited.
Samples of whitefly and symptomatic plant material (whitefly-transmitted
viruses) collected from Islas Canarias, Spain (Tenerife, Gran Canaria and
La Gomera) were studied by participants [at a workshop of the European
Whitefly Studies Network.
The results of this study were the following: No whitefly-transmitted
viruses were found on La Gomera. Tomato chlorosis crinivirus [ToCV (EPPO
Alert List) was found for the first time on Tenerife and Gran Canaria.
Tomato yellow leaf curl begomovirus (EPPO A2 quarantine pest) was found on
Tenerife (TYLCV-Is) and in Gran Canaria (TYLCV-Sar). [Tomato plants on
both islands were co-infected by TYLCV and ToCV.
Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder (EPPO Alert List) was also reported for
the first time on Tenerife. The following whitefly species were found on
the islands: _Aleurodicus dispersus_ (EPPO Alert List), _Aleurothrixus
floccosus_, _Bemisia afer_, _Bemisia tabaci_ (biotype B and Q - EPPO A2
quarantine pest), _Lecanoideus floccissimus_ (EPPO Alert List),
_Trialeurodes ricini_* (EPPO Alert List), _Trialeurodes vaporariorum_.

[According to the reference cited above, the continued presence of the
whitefly species _Bemisia tabaci_ in Southern Europe has led to
whitefly-transmitted viruses becoming a major problem to both field and
protected vegetable crops such as tomato and cucumber. These viruses
belong to either the genera Begomovirus (family: Geminiviridae) or
Crinivirus (family: Closteroviridae). So far 2 Begomovirus species, both
Tomato yellow leaf curl viruses (TYLCV/Sar and TYLCV/Is), and three
Crinivirus species, Beet pseudo yellows virus (BPYV), Cucurbit yellow
stunting disorder virus (CYSDV) and Tomato chlorosis virus (ToCV), have
been identified within Europe. Incidences of these viruses in crops are
still increasing in Spain and Portugal. Identification of ToCV as the
causal agent of the yellowing syndrome in tomato in Spain was reported.
Re-emergence of TYLCV/Sar (which was assumed to be replaced by TYLCV/Is),
was observed in Spain in 1999. Moreover, pepper and beans have now been
confirmed as hosts for TYLCV/Is in Spain and Portugal. There was general
agreement that methods for detecting and differentiating between TYLCV/Is
and TYLCV/Sar are thoroughly covered by members of the working group, but
the techniques for the detection of ToCV and CYSDV have still to be
improved. - Mod.DH
