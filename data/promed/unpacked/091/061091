Outbreak of disease in northern Fiji claims 23 deaths as authorities on
full alert
--------------------------------------
Medical authorities in northern Fiji are on full alert after reporting an
outbreak of leptospirosis which they said has claimed 23 lives to date.
News of the outbreak of the disease was officially announced today by
Fiji's Health Minister, Pita Nacuva after briefing his Cabinet Ministers in
Suva. "Cabinet was told the disturbing news that leptospirosis is sweeping
through Macuata Province (north of Fiji) and reaching epidemic
proportions," a statement released by Fiji's Ministry of Information said.
No other details were released.
The Ministry could only confirm that a committee has been formed comprising
medical and government officials to "monitor and control disease outbreaks
and institute preventative measures." "This taskforce may also seek
external support and funding to help combat the disease," the statement
added.
Leptospirosis is caused by bacteria and is spread by contact with farm
animal tissues as well as from common household rodents like rats. It can
also affect those who are exposed to water in rivers, lakes, canals and
drains contaminated by the urine of domestic animals. Symptoms of the
disease are fever, headache, chills, severe malaise, vomiting and muscle
pains.
"Leptospirosis is a deadly disease if left untreated," the Fiji Ministry of
Information statement said adding, "however the prognosis is good if
detected and treated early." The Ministry added isolated cases of the
disease were discovered in northern Fiji as early as 1998 and an outbreak
was reported in the area last year.
