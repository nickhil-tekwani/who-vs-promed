There have been 2 cases of mushroom poisoning registered in Kyrgyzstan. One
of them was a baby who died as a result of severe intoxication. In
addition, 3 more children are in the intensive care unit. Another case was
a family of 2 children and a mother. The mother is in coma; one boy is
dead, while the other one is improving.

The family was gathering mushrooms they were thought were the edible
version of the blue-leg mushroom (_Lepista saeva_) which doctors think had
mutated into a very poisonous type. Several more people hospitalized with
poisoning said that they were gathering mushrooms near the airport where
the discharge of highly toxic gasoline may have caused a less than
favorable environment for mushrooms.

Altogether more than 10 people are suffering from the poisoning and doctors
are thinking this is only the beginning of an outbreak. There was evidence
the poisonous mushrooms have appeared in the marketplace. The Ministry of
Health is working on prohibiting sale of any wild growing mushrooms.

[Beginning today it is forbidden in Kyrgyzstan to sell any mushrooms
according to Kyrgyzstan (KG) sanitary surveillance center. The regulation
is a result of frequent poisoning cases taking place the last days. Such
poisonings in KG were happening during previous years, as well. In 2005
there were 36 people hospitalized in Chuysk due to poisoning with wild
mushrooms. 3 children died during this outbreak while in 2006 there were 37
poisoned and 4 died. - Corr.BA

It is apparently more beautiful than tasty but nevertheless, there are
numerous recipes that treasure the flavor of this edible fungus. Many
mushrooms are toxic and many toxic varieties closely resemble the non-toxic
version. Collecting mushrooms can prove dangerous to deadly should the
wrong variety of mushroom be consumed. - Mod.TG]
