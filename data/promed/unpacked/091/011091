Authorities in eastern India will start culling chickens and
destroying eggs to contain a new outbreak of H5 bird flu, the
government said in a statement on Tuesday [20 Sep 2011], as a mutant
strain of the virus is spreading elsewhere in Asia.

Surveillance was stepped up in West Bengal, a state severely hit by
bird flu outbreaks in the past.

The federal government is pushing local authorities to ban the
movement of poultry and its products and restricting access to the
affected area after samples tested positive for H5, a government
statement said.

"It has been decided to immediately commence the culling of birds and
destruction of eggs and feed material to control further spread of the
disease," it said.

Last month [August 2011], the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation
(FAO) warned of a possible resurgence of bird flu and said a mutant
strain of the H5N1 virus was spreading in Asia and beyond. It was not
immediately clear whether the latest outbreak in India was related to
the new Asian strain.

Virologists warn there is no vaccine against the H5N1 strain recently
found in China and Viet Nam that could potentially carry risks for
humans and called for closer monitoring of the disease in poultry and
wild birds to stop it from spreading [see comment].

Bird flu 1st broke out in India in 2006, and millions of chickens and
ducks have been culled since then to contain the virus, but it has
resurfaced from time to time.

India did not give further details about the exact strain of flu found
in the latest outbreak in West Bengal.

[Though the causative agent is likely to be H5N1, final confirmation
is anticipated. It will also be of interest to note whether the
isolate is similar to older Indian isolates or a new strain such as
H5N1 mutant clade 2.3.2.1. (archived post 20110829.2654).

According to OIE's information (archived post 20110901.2678), the OIE
Reference Laboratory in Harbin, China has already developed a new
vaccine seed strain that experimentally protects poultry from this new
virus clade. This vaccine, once available for field use, will be used
in countries where H5N1 virus clade 2.3.2.1 has been identified.
Registration and manufacturing of a poultry vaccine with the new seed
strain is in progress. - Mod.AS]
