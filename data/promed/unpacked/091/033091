1st Report of Pathogenicity Group-3 of _Leptosphaeria maculans_ on
Winter Rape in Hungary
-----------------------------------------------
Sz. Szlavik, National Institute for Agricultural Quality Control,
Budapest, 1024 Hungary; T. Barasits, Plant Protection and Soil
Conservation Service of County Vas, Tanakajd, 9762 Hungary; and W. G.
D. Fernando, Department of Plant Science, University of Manitoba,
Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada. Plant Dis. 90:684, 2006; published
on-line as DOI: 10.1094/PD-90-0684C. Accepted for publication 9 Feb 2006.
Blackleg, caused by _Leptosphaeria maculans_, is an increasing threat
to winter rape (_Brassica napus_ L.) in Hungary. The winter rape
acreage has been increasing, and the occurrence and severity of the
disease has become widespread in all rapeseed-growing regions
throughout Hungary in a very short time. The blackleg-infected rape
stubbles were collected in the autumn of 2003 in Ikervar, County Vas,
where the disease was severe. Ascospores were obtained from
pseudothecia growing on infected rape stubble (susceptible cvs. GK
Helga and Aladin). Three single-spore cultures were grown on V8 agar
medium at room temperature and fluorescent light. The culture
characteristics fit the type culture description for _L. maculans_.
Pycnidiospores that formed on V8 plates were flooded with 10 ml of
sterile distilled water. Seeds of cvs. Westar, Glacier, and Quinta
obtained from the Department of Plant Science, University of
Manitoba, Canada were sown in plastic pots containing peat mix.
Seedlings were maintained in a growth chamber at 24 C with 90 percent
relative humidity and a 16-h photoperiod. Seven days after sowing,
cotyledons were wound inoculated with a 10-ul droplet of
pycnidiospore suspension (1.5 _ 10(^7) spores ml(^-1)). Interaction
phenotypes (IP) were scored 10 days after inoculation using a 0 to 9
scale (1). All 3 isolates from Ikervar were highly virulent on cvs.
Westar (8.8 to 8.9) and Glacier (8.1 to 8.3) and avirulent on cv.
Quinta (0.8 to 0.9). The IP ratings indicated that these isolates
belonged to pathogenicity group-3 (PG-3). To our knowledge, this is
the 1st report of the presence of _L. maculans_ PG-3 in Hungary. At
the current time, PG-3 has caused at least 30 percent yield losses in
susceptible cultivars of winter rape.

[The crop plant rape/rapeseed or canola, _Brassica napus_, develops
symptoms of the disease black leg when infected by the fungus
_Leptosphaeria maculans_.
Black leg (aka Phoma stem canker) is an economically important and
serious disease of canola (_Brassica napus_) in Australia, France,
Germany, USA, Canada and the United Kingdom. The infections of
blackleg may occur on cotyledons, leaves, stems and pods. Stem canker
is the most serious symptom, as it can girdle the stem, causing plant
lodging leading to yield loss. Three disease prevention methods --
crop rotation, genetic resistance and seed treatment with fungicide
-- have proven to be effective.
Isolates of canola can be categorized into 4 pathogenicity groups
(PGs) on the basis of the interaction phenotypes (IP) on the
differential canola cultivars Westar, Glacier, and Quinta by using a
standard screening protocol in the greenhouse. Isolates in PG1 are
weakly virulent, as they generally cause superficial lesions on the
leaves. However, isolates in PG2, PG3, and PG4 are highly virulent
because they can produce stem canker at the base of the canola plant,
causing significant yield loss. PG3 isolates (virulent on cv. Westar
and Glacier; avirulent on Quinta) are found in Europe, Australia, USA
and Canada. This article describes the 1st report of the presence of
_L. maculans_ PG3 in Hungary and will be useful when choosing which
varieties to grow.
