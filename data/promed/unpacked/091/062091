The University of Connecticut, working with the Connecticut
Department of Agriculture, has quarantined its 72-horse herd due to
an outbreak of equine herpesvirus infection.
Equine herpesvirus (EHV), or equine rhinopneumonitis, is passed from
horse to horse through respiratory discharges. People cannot contract
EHV, although they can inadvertently help spread the disease from
horse to horse by contact or contaminated equipment.
The quarantine has been imposed to stop the spread of EHV among
University of Connecticut (UConn) horses and from UConn horses to
horses outside the herd. It will remain in place for approximately 3
weeks after the last case of EHV has occurred, and after nasal swabs
indicate that affected horses are no longer contagious. Veterinarians
hope the quarantine may be released by early March 2007.
In the meantime, the stables are being sanitized regularly and
coursework directly involving the horses, polo practice, and other
activities will be temporarily suspended.
A sale of rescued horses by the Connecticut Department of Agriculture
scheduled to take place at the UConn polo arena on Jan. 20 has also
been postponed. The sale will be rescheduled once the UConn herd is
released from quarantine.

another facility unless they have been exposed to the virus, in which
case they should be part of the quarantine. - Mod.TG]
