Since the end of February 2022, France has experienced a resurgence of cases of hemolytic and uremic syndrome (HUS) linked to contamination with _E. coli_. These cases, which [can] cause kidney failure, occur [primarily] in children. According to Santé Publique France, 75 cases are under investigation as of this [Wed 30 Mar 2022], including 41 for which hemolytic and uremic syndromes have been identified, and 34 for which additional testing are in progress. The sick children are between 1 and 18 years old, and 2 children have died, although the connection to the pizzas has not been confirmed in either case.

Testing confirmed "a link between several cases and the consumption of frozen pizzas from the Fraich'Up range of the Buitoni brand contaminated with _Escherichia coli_ bacteria", announced in a press release the General Directorate of Health, which depends on the government, while a massive recall of these pizzas was launched two weeks ago. "Today we do not understand what could have happened, but we are going to develop an analysis protocol that we are going to submit to the authorities", said Jérôme Jaton, industrial director general of Nestlé, during a conference in press on Wed, 30 Mar 2022. "I am wholeheartedly with these families who have cases of poisoning, often with young children," he added.

The cases occurred in 12 regions of metropolitan France: Hauts-de-France (16 cases), New Aquitaine (11 cases), Pays de la Loire (10 cases), Ile-de-France (9 cases), Brittany (7 cases), Grand Est (5 cases), Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes (4 cases), Center Val-de-Loire (4 cases), Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur (3 cases), Bourgogne Franche-Comté (2 cases), Normandy (2 cases) and Occitanie (2 cases).

Until now, the health authorities considered that there was a "possible" link between these contaminations and the pizzas of the Fraich'Up range. Without waiting, they had launched the recall of pizzas in mid-March 2022, asking consumers to destroy them if they had any in their freezers. Now, the link is confirmed with some additional testing.

Since 18 Mar 2022, Nestlé has closed 2 production lines at its factory near Caudry (North) in order to carry out analyses, explained Jérome Jaton. "We have no information on the links between the pizzas and the contaminated people", affirms the general manager in charge of the communication of Nestlé France, Pierre-Alexandre Teulié. "We are ready to question ourselves completely on the potential causes", assures Jérome Jaton, who does not exclude contamination at the level of the pizza dough.

The Fraich'Up pizzas come in 9 different flavors, raclette, kebab, 4 cheeses, and others. Nestlé claims to produce between 100 000 and 150 000 pizzas per week.

Health authorities point out the need to consult a doctor in the event of the onset, within ten days after eating the pizza, of diarrhea, abdominal pain or vomiting. The consultation is also necessary if, within 15 days, signs of great fatigue, pallor, or a decrease in the volume of urine, which become darker, appear. "In the absence of symptoms within 15 days of consumption, it is also reminded that there is no need to worry", explains the DGS.

[The number of cases continues to increase in this outbreak. Since HUS generally occurs in less than 10% of enterohemorrhagic _E coli_ cases, the total number of infections is likely to be at least 10 times higher. The following is a good basic review on HUS:

Abstract
"The severity of human infection by one of the many Shiga toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ (STEC) is determined by a number of factors: the bacterial genome, the capacity of human societies to prevent foodborne epidemics, the medical condition of infected patients (in particular their hydration status, often compromised by severe diarrhea), and by our capacity to devise new therapeutic approaches, most specifically to combat the bacterial virulence factors, as opposed to our current strategies that essentially aim to palliate organ deficiencies. The last major outbreak in 2011 in Germany, which killed more than 50 people in Europe, was evidence that an effective treatment was still lacking. Herein, we review the current knowledge of STEC virulence, how societies organize the prevention of human disease, and how physicians treat (and, hopefully, will treat) its potentially fatal complications. In particular, we focus on STEC-induced hemolytic and uremic syndrome (HUS), where the intrusion of toxins inside endothelial cells results in massive cell death, activation of the coagulation within capillaries, and eventually organ failure."

Flour is an uncommon but reported vehicle for the transmission of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ of a variety of serotypes. The serotype is not specifically mentioned here. Since dough made from flour is generally eaten fully cooked, most episodes seemed to have been linked to ingestion of uncooked or undercooked dough. It is possible that kitchen contamination with the EHEC occurred before the cooking of the frozen pizza. - Mod.LL
