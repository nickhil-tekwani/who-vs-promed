AVIAN INFLUENZA, HUMAN (65): INDONESIA, REPORTING
*************************************************
A ProMED-mail post

[ProMED-mail thanks our readers for the many responses about whether
or not we should report suspect human cases of H5N1 from Indonesia,
or wait for confirmation, which could be considerably delayed. We
print excerpts below, and our conclusion at the end.]

******
I write in support of reporting H5N1 cases, even if unconfirmed by
the relevant authorities. The best example of [the benefit of] such a
policy is that of SARS [severe acute respiratory syndrome], which was
picked up by ProMED-mail before official acknowledgement, and which
many believe played a significant role in the subsequent efforts
leading to its containment. Further, as a matter of consistency,
ProMED-mail does not wait for official word before reporting on any
of many other outbreaks elsewhere in the world.

I'm not a medical person but, as a business type required to scan for
business threats, I consider ProMED-mail to be the best service I've
been able to find. While I dislike intensely the idea of running dual
"confirmed" and "suspected" avian flu tallies (it offends the data
purist in me!), I see few alternatives in light of the current
Indonesian [position].

If ProMED-mail continues this policy of not reporting suspect cases
of infectious disease when a country is in flagrant violation of the
IHR (and basic common sense public health), then ProMED will be of
little use. Such a policy merely encourages other miscreants to do the same.

ProMED-mail policy-makers should bear in mind that while
unsubstantiated reports of suspected human cases of avian H5N1
influenza can create "alarm and despondency," rumor-mongering among
the frightened public has considerably more potential in that regard,
with considerably worse consequences than the outcome of discussions
among reasonably well-informed professionals. The most effective
response to that sort of thing is not to deny that people (or
animals) are dropping dead, but rather to identify real possible
causes as rapidly as possible, and to distribute good information
about avoidance and prevention of the possible cause before the rumor
mill gets going.

Even before the actual source and cause of an outbreak is
established, pointing out basic, common-sense potential preventive
measures such as hand-washing and using mosquito nets, can help to
establish disease control and prevent panic.

The last thing we need is to play ostrich and delaying tactics games
with HPAI [highly pathogenic avian influenza] outbreaks in any part
of the world. Experts should be trusted with enough pre-confirmatory
judgment to alert cases of suspected HPAI, rather than play a waiting
game that could cost the world millions of lives if we fail to
prepare and take precautionary actions. Waiting games could be
costly. A report indicating a new strain of HPAI in Nigeria, Africa,
is worrying enough, but not galvanizing steps to stop or slow down
the spread of the virus anywhere in the world is like sitting on an
atomic bomb waiting for the right trigger.

I was so disappointed in your recent decision on suspect bird flu
cases in Indonesia. We are not getting any valuable information from
Indonesia and very, very little from [elsewhere]. ProMED-mail has
always been an excellent source of news on disease outbreaks, and you
have always marked them as suspect until confirmation, so why do you
want to treat something as deadly as the H5N1 virus any differently?
I ask you to reconsider your decision. It is the RIGHT thing to do.

In my opinion you are definitely NOT creating alarm and despondency.
Suspected cases are, as a rule, looked up and followed by experienced
ProMED 'watchers' who can weigh the information and be alert if
necessary. Being alert is quite different from being alarmed. The
disclaimer of ProMED-mail is clear enough about the intent to be as
truthful as possible, and holding the reader responsible and
implicitly capable of taking the risk resulting from reading the posts.

I am in favor of ProMED-mail posting on all known and suspected cases
of human H5N1 or other types of human 'bird' flu.

ProMED-mail conclusions
-----------------------
ProMED's motive in seeking to screen out unsubstantiated reports of
suspected human cases of H5N1 avian influenza from Indonesia was
simply to avoid creating alarm and despondency.

ProMED-mail has now decided to report all suspected human cases of
H5N1 from Indonesia because the usual flow of information -- first
suspect and then confirmation -- is disrupted there because of their
public health policy.

In countries where the standard flow is working properly, it is
counterproductive to report suspects because many of them will not be
confirmed as positive, thereby causing undue alarm. Over time, this
could have the effect of "crying wolf" (repeated false alarms leading
to a true alarm being ignored). - Mods.ProMED-mail
