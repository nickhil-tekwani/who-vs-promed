Outbreaks of _Salmonella newport_ infection in two European countries.
At the end of January 1998, Enter-net's Finnish collaborator (Petri Ruutu,
Chief of Infectious Disease Surveillance Unit, National Public Health
Institute, Helsinki, Finland, <Petri.Ruutu@ktl.fi>) reported a large
increase in the numbers of cases of _Salmonella newport_ infection being
reported in central and southern Finland. The Finnish public health
authorities were aware of three separate incidents, two of them funeral
receptions and one a cluster associated with a restaurant, together with
several of cases with no clear clustering.
At the same time, the Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS) Communicable
Disease Surveillance Centre for England and Wales had learnt of two
clusters of _S. newport_ infection in north west England and Wales.
Subsequent investigation revealed a cluster of cases in London. The PHLS
Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens (LEP) has subjected isolates of _S.
newport_ from England and Wales to a provisional phage typing scheme and
identified that the clusters were caused by a novel phage type. Forty-one
out of 69 isolates in 1998 have been of the novel type, compared with five
(mostly in the second half of the year) out of 187 _S. newport_ identified
in 1997.
_S. newport_ strains associated with the Finnish outbreak were sent to LEP
for phage typing and 18 were confirmed as being of the novel phage type.
Investigators are continuing to try to find a vehicle responsible for these
international clusters of infection.
