Tick-borne encephalitis [TBE]: Trentino area at risk, 23 cases on average per year
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In Trentino, 204 TBE cases have been encountered, transmitted by ticks, between 2000 and 2020. Cases have risen over the past 5 years, reaching up to 23.2 cases on average each year. The whole of Trentino can be considered as a risk area.

The data -- we learn -- emerged in the dissemination meeting promoted by the provincial control room for the surveillance and control of vectors of medical-veterinary interest, hosted by Muse.

[Cases of tick-borne encephalitis have been infrequently posted by ProMED, despite the above report indicating that there have been 23 cases per year over the past 5 years. Specific case numbers per year for these 5 years are not given.

Trentino is endemic for the virus. The species of virus vector tick that is transmitting the virus is not mentioned. Central and eastern European countries are endemic for the European subtype of TBE virus and cases occur yearly there. Castor bean ticks, _Ixodes ricinus_, are the main vectors that transmit TBE virus to people. Presumably, the public will be warned of this risk and advised of measures to avoid tick bites and be vaccinated as people become more active out of doors with the onset of warmer weather. There is no mention above if individuals in Trentino are vaccinated. - Mod.TY
