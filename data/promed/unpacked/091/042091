Indian health authorities say they're taking steps to deal with a
widespread outbreak of cerebral malaria in the eastern part of the country.

SK Singh, health officer for India's Munger district, says 6 malaria
victims, including 2 children, have died while under treatment, CNN
reported Sunday [9 Aug 2009].

Singh told the US broadcaster that more than 600 local residents have
tested positive for the _Plasmodium falciparum_ parasite, the presence of
which indicates an elevated risk for malaria. He said fumigation drives
have been launched in Munger district and residents were being urged to
report to health centers if they experience flu-like systems. "We have also
launched an awareness campaign aimed at preventing mosquito breeding and
bites," Singh told CNN.

At least 6 people, including children, have died of cerebral malaria and
more than 1000 were afflicted with the disease in Bihar's Munger district,
a health official said on Sunday [9 Aug 2009].

District health official RN Pandey said the deaths had taken place in
Haveli Kharagpur sub-division of Munger since the last 2 weeks, when the
infections were first reported.

He said nearly 80 villages of Haveli Kharagpur had reported cases of
cerebral malaria.

[The increase in cerebral malaria suggests an increase in resistance. There
was a prior outbreak of cerebral malaria in a different district in Bihar
in 2004. The WHO statistics for Bihar, 2000 through 2006, are as follows
(<http://www.whoindia.org/LinkFiles/Malaria_Malaria_cases_from_2000_to_2006.pdf>):

Year: number of cases / API / deaths
------------------------------------
2000: 9509 / 0.12 / 2
2001: 4108 / 0.05 / 0
2002: 3683 / 0.04 / 2
2003: 2652 / 0.03 / 1
2004: 1872 / 0.02 / 0
2005: 2733 / 0.03 / 1
2006: 2744 / 0.03 / 1
API: Annual Parasite Incidence; (confirmed cases during 1 year/population
under surveillance) x 1000

Hence, 1500 cases and 6 deaths in a 2 week period is a significant increase
in both cases and deaths suggesting something is going on there. - Mod.MPP

Resistance to chloroquine is well documented from India and the present
press reports do not mention which drug has been used to treat the
patients. Depending on the drug of choice, resistance is one possibility.
But substandard or counterfeit drugs are a problem in South East Asia and
this needs to be considered every time there is an unexpected treatment
failure (see Malaria drug, adverse events - India: RFI 20090706.2431). - Mod.EP
