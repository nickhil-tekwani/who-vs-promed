Malaria Outbreak Blamed on Troops' Failure to Take Drug in Liberia
-----------------------------------------
The large outbreak of malaria among Marines who spent time ashore in the
West African nation of Liberia in the summer was apparently caused by a
nearly wholesale failure of the troops to follow protective measures, and
in particular not taking a once-a-week malaria-preventing drug.
Blood samples taken from the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit right after
malaria was diagnosed in several troops in early September 2003 showed that
only 5 percent had been regularly taking the recommended drug, mefloquine.
Only 12 percent wore uniforms properly treated with the insecticide
permethrin. Only 27 percent reported using the time-released insect
repellant issued to them. And none slept under insecticide-treated mosquito
nets.
The findings were presented this week in closed briefings to the House and
Senate Armed Services committees. "It is difficult to get these young
Marines, who are willing to charge a machine gun nest, to be worried about
a mosquito," said Cmdr. David L. McMillan, a Navy physician involved in the
investigation. "It is much more difficult than we believe it should be."
Out of 290 people who went ashore in Liberia, even briefly, from ships
waiting off the Atlantic coast, 80 contracted malaria -- an "attack rate"
of 28 percent. Of the 157 troops who spent at least one night ashore, 69
became infected -- an attack rate of 44 percent. In all, 44 were ill enough
with falciparum malaria -- the most serious of the 3 types of the disease
-- to be evacuated to Europe or the United States. No one died, although
several developed cerebral malaria -- an infection of the brain -- that
required them to be on mechanical ventilators in intensive-care units. In
addition to Marines from the expeditionary force, the victims included 7 in
the Navy, 2 Marine embassy guards, an Army soldier, and a civilian.
McMillan said a team of military and civilian epidemiologists, infectious
disease physicians, and preventive medicine specialists who met on 9 Oct
2003 to review the episode concluded that better education about the risk
of malaria is the best way to prevent future outbreaks. The group did not
think that requiring unit commanders to directly observe people taking
their medicine -- a strategy employed with great success in civilian
tuberculosis treatment -- would be practical or necessary.
Liberia and neighboring areas in West Africa have some of the most intense
malaria transmission in the world. By one estimate, there is a 50 percent
chance that a person who takes no protective measures will be infected
within a month. Most of the troops from the expeditionary unit who stayed
ashore were there for about 2 weeks.
Mefloquine, sold under the trade name Lariam, sometimes causes vivid dreams
and insomnia, and in a few cases appears to affect mood. After several
soldiers who returned from Afghanistan 2 years ago committed murder or
suicide, rumors circulated attributing the violence to mefloquine. Further
investigation refuted that idea. McMillan said that when investigators
asked the 41 people treated at the National Naval Medical Center in
Bethesda whether they were afraid mefloquine might have psychological
effects, none said he or she was.
Complacency appeared to be the main reason people did not take it. "They
had been given the same series of recommendations as for Afghanistan,
Djibouti, and Iraq. Nobody was having any problems" when they did not
closely follow the malaria-prevention orders there, he said. In Liberia,
however, the risk of contracting malaria is about 1000 times higher than in
the Persian Gulf or in Central Asia.
Blood samples from 133 Marines were tested for mefloquine levels at the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in Atlanta. 70 percent
contained breakdown products of the drug, which is evidence that some
amount of the medicine had been taken in the preceding month. Only 14
percent had levels high enough to be protective at the time.
Only 5 percent of the samples indicated that the medicine had been taken
every week. Logistical problems were responsible for some of the other
failures. For example, the unit ordered the permethrin dipping solution for
its uniforms but did not get it before it left the United States, McMillan
said. Instead, it received spray cans of the insecticide, which was used to
treat the desert-camouflage uniforms the troops wore early in the
deployment. In Liberia, they wore woodland-camouflage uniforms, and only 12
percent of the troops treated those.
Permethrin-treated sleeping nets -- a low-tech item whose use has been
shown to dramatically lower malaria mortality in West Africa -- were not
even taken ashore, McMillan said. The Liberia excursion was a "man-portable
mission" in which each individual carried everything he needed. The nets
require 4 poles, and ideally a cot, to be used correctly. In addition, many
troops were apparently reluctant to use the long-acting insect repellant
containing DEET issued to them because it made them feel greasy in hot
weather. Tests by the Food and Drug Administration and by the Walter Reed
Army Institute of Research showed that the mefloquine tablets the Marines
used were potent and that the malaria parasite was not resistant to the drug.

[It is comforting to know that the high rate of failure was due to
non-compliance with the prophylaxis and not failure of the prophylaxis
itself. Most -- if not all -- of these cases would have been completely
prevented by mefloquine prophylaxis at recommended doses and intervals. The
high attack rate in the U.S. soldiers in Liberia is now fully explained,
and the data show the risk of malaria in non-protected non-immune people in
Liberia. - Mod.EP]
