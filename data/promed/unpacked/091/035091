The Valencia Farmers Association (AVA) has warned of a new disease caused by a bacterium that destroys olive and almond groves and other crops in Italy (see ProMED-mail post 20131101.2033095). It has called on the European Commission to ensure extreme control and "utmost rigor" to prevent the spread of this disease.

The report of 2 outbreaks in olive, almond, and ornamental plants in the Italian province of Lecce [Puglia region] has triggered alarm in the EU [see link below for special alert]. The EU executive has already banned the movement of plant material from affected territories in order to avoid possible spread of this harmful organism which was previously not present in Europe.

According to the AVA, indications are that, once again, agricultural imports from 3rd countries have caused the entry of a new pathogen into Europe.

[_Xylella fastidiosa_ (Xf) clogs the xylem in infected plants causing wilting, necrosis, and often death of the host. It has been reported from a number of crops causing very serious diseases such as Pierce's disease of grapevine, leaf scorch of almond, phony disease of peach, leaf scald of plum, variegated chlorosis of citrus, lucerne dwarf, as well as leaf scorch of coffee, elm, oak, plane, mulberry, maple, oleander, and other woody ornamentals. In olive and almond, it causes branch dieback and leaf scorch. Latent infections of a number of wild species have also been reported, and these can serve as pathogen reservoirs. While all strains of _Xylella_ have been classified into a single species, there are different pathotypes, most of which have not been characterised and compared with each other yet. The pathotype affecting oleander and almond, but not grapevine, has been reported to also affect olives. Several subspecies have been proposed.

_X. fastidiosa_ is spread by xylem-feeding insect vectors including several species of sharpshooters (including _Carneocephala_, _Draeculacephala_, _Graphocephala_, and _Homalodisca_ species). It can also be spread by grafting and with infected plant material, but is not seed-borne. Moist conditions favour the vectors and therefore Xf associated diseases. Disease management is difficult due to the large numbers of potential reservoir hosts and vector insects and may include use of clean planting and grafting material, as well as vector control.

The pathogen has been reported mainly from the Americas, but was recently confirmed for the 1st time in Asia, on grapevine in Taiwan (ProMED-mail post 20130806.1866205). It has also been suspected in other locations in Asia and its occurrence in Oceania is currently unknown. Both the bacterium and its main vectors are of serious quarantine concern in Europe, Africa and Australasia.

In Italy, final confirmation of Xf awaits results of ongoing infectivity tests, but it appears likely that the outbreak in Italy represents the 1st report of the pathogen in Europe. While a source of the European incursion is currently still unknown, the claim above that it was due to contaminated imports of plant material does appear likely. The pathogen has been added to the quarantine list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO) and a special alert has been issued for the region (links below).
