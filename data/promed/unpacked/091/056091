Five monkeys were found dead in Sagar taluk [Karnataka] on [Sun 23 Jan 2019].

Rajesh Suragihalli, District Health Officer, told The Hindu that while 2 monkeys were found dead at Sampa and Vatematti villages, one monkey was found dead at Chandramavinakoppalu on the outskirts of Sagar city.

The viscera of the monkeys had been sent to a laboratory for tests. Malathion powder had been sprayed in a radius of 50 metres [165 feet] from where the carcasses were found to prevent the movement of ticks that spread Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) virus.

Mr Suragihalli said awareness would be created among people residing in the vicinity where the incidents of deaths of monkeys were reported so that they take precautions and do not come in contact with the ticks.

Meanwhile, one person from Aralagodu village who was suffering from high fever and joint pain, the symptoms of KFD or monkey fever, was admitted to a private hospital in Manipal.

It may be mentioned here that the government has announced to bear the expense incurred to provide treatment for KFD patients in private hospitals.

Mr Suragihalli said that if the need for re-admission to a private hospital arises for such patients, the State government would also bear that cost.

[Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD), caused by a tick-borne flavivirus, is seen in a limited area of India. It was first reported in the spring of 1957, when an outbreak of severe disease was documented in people living near the Kyasanur Forest in Karnataka state, India, which also affected wild nonhuman primates. The vector is _Haemaphysalis spinigera_, a tick whose immature stages are avid primate feeders, including humans. Ticks transmit the virus transovarially. Wild monkeys, _Presbytis entellus_ (black faced langur) and _Macaca radiata_ (red faced bonnet monkey), are very common in the forest localities where KFDV circulates. - Mod.PMB
