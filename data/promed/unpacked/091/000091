Investigation Update
--------------------
Several state health and agriculture departments are collecting and testing leftover cucumbers from retail locations for the presence of _Salmonella_. Since the last update on 4 Sep 2015, the Nevada Department of Health and Human Services isolated one of the outbreak strains of _S._ Poona from a cucumber collected from a retail location. Additionally, the Arizona Department of Health Services and the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services isolated _Salmonella_ from cucumbers collected from retail locations. Preliminary information indicates that these cucumbers were distributed by Andrew & Williamson Fresh Produce. DNA "fingerprinting" is being conducted to determine the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern of the _Salmonella_ isolated from the cucumbers in Arizona and Montana. DNA "fingerprinting" is still ongoing for the _Salmonella_ isolated from cucumbers collected from the Andrew & Williamson Fresh Produce facility by the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency. Results of additional product testing will be reported when available.

[ProMED awaits more information regarding the scope of this substantial and growing multistate outbreak. Since cucumbers, like cantaloupes that have been associated with _S._ Poona infections, grow on ground vines, they are even more susceptible to contamination by pathogen-containing irrigation water. The exact method of contamination related to this outbreak, however, is unclear. - Mod.LL
