Cattle not infected with anthrax; all measures therefore terminated
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Additional diagnostic tests in the laboratory rebutted the suspicion
of anthrax, which a practicing veterinarian diagnosed on Monday [5 Sep
2011] of the cattle in the municipality of Vitanje.

The Veterinary Administration shall be notified that the prescribed
measures be terminated in regard to the cattle on the farm.

[When I am involved in field and outbreak investigations I learnt many
years ago of the very positive value of going back to brief one's
farmers as to what had been discovered and to say "Thank you." If I
had any unanswered questions virtually without exception my farmers
would say, "Oh, didn't I tell you?" or I would see something I had not
seen before -- whether turkey poults in an incubator drinking water
and transferring drips of it to the dry salmonella-contaminated feed,
or the farmer's son helping a young calf drink milk out of a bucket by
sticking his faeces contaminated fingers into its mouth. My last
remark was always, "Thank you but I hope we never meet again." "Why?"
they would ask. "Because if I am back you are again in serious
trouble." They would grin but they knew who to call if they had to.

This Slovenian negative is good news. And may they continue to be on
the alert to the possibility of anthrax with sudden cattle deaths. -
