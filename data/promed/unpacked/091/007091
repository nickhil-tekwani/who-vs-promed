[In July 2014, classical swine fever was reported in domestic swine in the Province of Tuv (Tov). The event was resolved on 7 Aug 2014. (See event summary at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=15533.)

Unlike the outbreak reported in July 2014 where vaccination was applied as a control measure (330 pigs were vaccinated), no vaccination was applied for this latest event.
