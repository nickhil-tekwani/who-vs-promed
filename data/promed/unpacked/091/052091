[Newcastle disease (ND) is a highly contagious and often severe disease found worldwide that affects birds including domestic poultry. It is caused by a virus in the family of paramyxoviruses.

ND is transmitted most often by direct contact with diseased or carrier birds. Infected birds may shed the virus in their feces, contaminating the environment. Transmission can then occur by direct contact with feces and respiratory discharges or by contaminated food, water, equipment, and human clothing. Newcastle disease viruses can survive for several weeks in the environment, especially in cool weather.

Generally, virus is shed during the incubation period and for a short time during recovery. Birds in the pigeon family can shed the virus intermittently for a year or more. Other wild birds such as cormorants have also been shown to have caused outbreaks in domestic poultry.

The virus is present in all parts of the carcass of an infected bird. The disease is very contagious. When the virus is introduced into a susceptible flock, virtually all the birds will be infected within 2 to 6 days.

Newcastle disease is a minor zoonosis (disease of animals that can also infect humans) and can cause conjunctivitis in humans, but the condition is generally very mild and self limiting (http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Media_Center/docs/pdf/Disease_cards/NEWCAS-EN.pdf).

Although the source of infection is indicated as 'unknown', in the epidemiological comments, it is mentioned that the source of infection could be imported poultry meat. If this source is confirmed, it would be of interest to know the origin of such an importation.

Feral chickens are derived from domestic chickens (_Gallus gallus domesticus_) that have returned to the wild. Like the red junglefowl (the closest wild relative of domestic chickens), feral chickens will take flight and roost in tall trees and bushes in order to avoid predators at night (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feral_chicken).

Saint Helena, named after Saint Helena of Constantinople, is a tropical island of volcanic origin in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is part of the British Overseas Territory of Saint Helena, Ascension, and Tristan da Cunha, which also includes Ascension Island and the islands of Tristan da Cunha. Saint Helena measures about 16 by 8 km (10 by 5 mi) and has a population of 4255 (2008 census). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Helena#Administrative_divisions
