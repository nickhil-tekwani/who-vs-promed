At least 100 Afghan policemen and government officials, including a
deputy provincial governor, were poisoned after eating their evening
meal. A man claiming to be from the Taliban said he had carried out
the mass poisoning, but NATO's military force, which offered medical
treatment, said it was believed to be a straightforward case of food poisoning.

About 100 men fell ill in the eastern province of Nuristan late
yesterday [20 Sep 2008] after eating Iftar, the evening meal that
breaks a day of fasting during the holy month of Ramadan, deputy
provincial governor Abdul Halim said. They had all eaten food
prepared in the kitchen of the governor, which feeds some provincial
authorities and police who guard the compound.

"After we had our Iftar, about 100 people felt really ill," he said.

Many had fainted, and about 360 people were given medical treatment.
Halim said he had also taken ill but had recovered by Sunday [21 Sep
2008]. The provincial police chief was, however, still being treated
in a clinic, he said.

The source of the poisoning appeared to have been the bread, but it
was being investigated. NATO's International Security Assistance
Force, in Afghanistan to help the government defeat a Taliban-led
insurgency, said about 160 people were treated at a clinic and 200
more at a local police station.

"Although the cause of the illness is not fully understood, it is
believed to be a straightforward case of food poisoning, and the
matter is being investigated by the Afghan National Police," it said
in a statement.

A man who gave his name as Ajab Khan and said he was a Taliban
commander in the region claimed responsibility for the poisoning and
said 300 people had been affected.

[Little detail is given in the posting regarding the symptoms of
those affected except for fainting. A majority of foodborne illness
presents primarily with nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhea. In addition
to botulism, a number of the shellfish-associated toxins are
primarily neurotoxins. The pathophysiology of the episode, presumably
but not clearly foodborne, is not clear.

The province of Nuristan (also spelled Nurestan) is one of 34
provinces of Afghanistan and borders Pakistan. It can be found on a map at:
