[Jharkand is an endemic area for malaria, but cerebral malaria is a
sign of advanced disease either due to late treatment or ineffective
treatment. The drugs available are not mentioned in the article, but
resistance against chloroquine is widespread in India. ProMED will be
happy to post information on the of the drugs used for treatment if
any treatment was given before the patients presented with cerebral
malaria.
