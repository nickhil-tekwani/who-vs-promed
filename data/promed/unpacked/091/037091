Rotaviral Gastroenteritis Outbreak in Alice Springs
---------------------------------------------------
The Alice Springs Hospital has been forced to recruit nurses from Darwin
and set up 2 makeshift children's wards to cope with an outbreak of
gastroenteritis [attributed to rotavirus infection. Further admissions in
the past 12 hours have increased the number of children admitted to the
hospital to 80. The Executive Director of Nursing Services said that
additional staff were called in at the weekend. "We've flown in 7
additional nurses from Darwin and we have another 8 coming from Darwin this
week, so we'll have a total of 15 additional nurses to help out with the
patient load," he said.

[Rotavirus infection is the principal cause of gastroenteritis in infants
and young children. Rotavirus infection can be diagnosed rapidly by electron
microscopy on account of the high concentration of the morphologically
characteristic particles present in feces. There is currently no licensed
vaccine; treatment by rehydration is effective in most cases. - Mod.CP
