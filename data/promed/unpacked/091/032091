Ebola fatalities in Congo raise concern of more virulent strain
---------------------------------------------------------------
- 3 cases suffered acute bleeding when symptoms began
- community resistance to isolation, vaccines slowing progress

The strain of Ebola virus that killed all 3 people known to have caught it in the Democratic Republic of Congo since April [2022] may be more virulent, according to a nonprofit group that runs 3 treatment centers there.

An acute loss of blood was the 1st symptom observed in all 3 patients reported in Congo's remote northwestern province of Equateur, said Baweye Mayoum Barka, the incoming head of mission in the country for the Alliance for International Medical Actions. That's unlike cases seen during the previous 2 outbreaks there in which most began with fever or fatigue and only about 15% of patients hemorrhaged, he said.

Genetic sequencing of the virus responsible for the latest outbreak indicate it's unlike the strain that sparked larger epidemics in 2018 and 2020, Mayoum Barka said. Those outbreaks sickened about 180 people, according to the World Health Organization.

Almost 300 people who'd been in contact with the latest cases are being monitored for infection, the WHO's Africa Region office said Tuesday [17 May 2022]. The 1st patient, a 31-year-old man, developed symptoms on [5 Apr 2022] and died 16 days later at a treatment center in the city of Mbandaka.

Only 2 additional cases have been confirmed, suggesting the strain is less transmissible, Mayoum Barka said. "It seems that, while the reproductive rate is quite low, the virulence of the virus is very high," he said in an interview Wednesday [18 May 2022].

Ebola virus disease was discovered in Congo, Africa's 2nd largest country by land area, in 1976. Until vaccines and treatments became available in recent years, outbreaks with fatality rates of up to 90% frequently triggered international concern.

The 2018 and 2020 Ebola outbreaks in Congo, the biggest in sub-Saharan Africa, resulted in 50%-60% mortality, mostly as a result of fluid loss caused by acute diarrhea, Mayoum Barka said.

Although the current outbreak appears to be contained, members of the affected community in Mbandaka have been reluctant to undergo testing, fearful of being asked to isolate in a dedicated facility, Mayoum Barka said. That's hampering disease surveillance efforts, just as vaccine hesitancy leaves more people vulnerable to the infection, he said.

Some 22 contacts were identified as being suspected Ebola cases by [15 May 2022]. Of those, 6 died before they could be tested and 16 refused to be isolated and are still in the community, he said.

"We need to remove the thinking that an isolation center is a mortuary center," he said. "This makes the response very, very complicated."

Just over 800 people out of a regional population of about 340 000 people have been vaccinated, compared with tens of thousands in more recent outbreaks.

The numbers in this report differ from WHO/AFRO numbers. Here it is stated that of 22 contacts suspected to have Ebola as of 15 May 2022, 6 died. But only 5 are being reported by WHO, with 4 confirmed [Ebola update (07): Congo DR (EQ) WHO 20220527.8703498 and see below].

The case number is currently low, perhaps indicating low transmissibility, but virus spread could also be hampered by vaccination and greater adherence to protective measures being taken as knowledge and understanding of how to control transmission of Ebola virus have increased. Virulence may be greater as proposed above, but there are only 4 confirmed cases on which to base that determination, and to date, no laboratory comparisons. - Mod.LK]

More than Ebola: DRC reports cholera, measles, monkeypox, plague, and typhoid outbreaks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has spread out to a new Health Zone with a new confirmed case reported on [19 May 2022] in Mama Balako Health Area, Wangata Health Zone in Mbandaka City, Equateur Province.

Two Health Zones (Mbandaka and Wangata) and 3 Health areas are now affected (Libiki, Motema Pembe for Mbandaka Health Zone and Mama Balako for Wangata health Zone).

As of [22 May 2022], a total of 5 cases including 4 confirmed cases and 1 probable case with 5 deaths (case fatality ratio (CFR): 100%) are reported.

However, it's not just Ebola the country is battling:

Cholera
In 2022 through 1 May, 5485 suspected cholera cases including 79 deaths (CFR: 1.4%) were recorded in 54 health zones across 11 provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Measles
From [1 Jan-1 May 2022], 47 514 suspected measles cases and 684 deaths (CFR 1.4%) were reported in 349 health zones in 26 provinces.

Monkeypox
In the 1st 4 months of 2022, DRC has reported 1238 monkeypox cases, including 57 deaths (CFR 4.6%).

Plague
Through [1 May 2022], DRC has seen 88 cases of plague, including 2 deaths (2.0% CFR). Lokpa remains the epicentre reporting 95% of cases reported this year.

Typhoid fever
In 2022, through 1 May, 634 401 suspected cases of typhoid fever including 279 deaths were recorded in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

In addition, outbreaks of yellow fever, meningitis and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) are reported and being monitored.

[The incidence of many endemic diseases has been exacerbated by COVID, civil war, and political instability in DR Congo. It is a challenging situation and healthcare is suffering. But the country has handled the most recent Ebola outbreaks so successfully, that one would hope this knowledge could be transferred to other infectious disease problems. See Venkatesan P. Managing infectious diseases in DR Congo: lessons learned from Ebola. Lancet Microbe. 2020; 1(4): e153; https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(20)30102-6/fulltext. - Mod.LK
