According to Resolution no 18 ( adopted at the 82nd General Session of the OIE, May 2014), Romania is a Member country recognized as having negligible bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) risk status in accordance with Chapter 11.5. of the Terrestrial Code. The complete list of BSE Risk Status of Member Countries can be found at http://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/official-disease-status/bse/list-of-bse-risk-status/.

For more information on the disease , official OIE status recognition and recommendations please access the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code at http://www.oie.int/en/international-standard-setting/terrestrial-code/access-online/ Chapter 11.5 on Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy: http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.11.5.htm

What does atypical BSE mean?
There are naturally and sporadic occurring forms of encephalopathy in several mammalian species, including man. The pathogenesis of sporadic forms of BSE (currently called "atypical" to distinguish them from the forms occurring through contaminated feed) is under scientific investigation. While there is an awareness of the different forms, the OIE does not yet recognise an atypical form of BSE as a distinct entity for the purpose of its international standards; therefore, it is not mentioned in the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code, which does not distinguish between different forms of BSE (http://www.oie.int/en/for-the-media/press-releases/detail/article/bovine-spongiform-encephalopathy-bse-case-in-brazil-frequently-asked-questions-and-answers/.)
