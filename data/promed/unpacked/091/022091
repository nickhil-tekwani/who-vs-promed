-----------------------------------------------
The 24th human case infected with bird flu was recorded on Sat 10 Mar
2007, when an Egyptian child was diagnosed positive for the disease
this evening by health officials.
Mohammad Ibrahim, 4, of al-Daqhalia governorate north of the capital
Cairo, was suffering from high temperature when admitted to hospital,
as his tests came back positive for avian influenza, the Egyptian
health ministry said in a statement.
Thirteen human deaths [have been reported] since the virulent virus
infiltrated Egypt in February 2006, in addition to substantial
economic loses suffered by the poultry business. Since the virus
reemerged in Asia in 2003, outbreaks have been confirmed in around 50
countries and territories, according to data from the World
Organization for Animal Health.
The virus has killed 168 people since 2003, according to the World

Azerbaijan, Cambodia, China, Egypt, Indonesia, Iraq, Laos, Nigeria,
Thailand, Turkey, Viet Nam. [Of affected countries, only Djibouti
