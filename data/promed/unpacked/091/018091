[1] Lebanon ex Syria
Date: Tue 11 Mar 2014

A 19-month-old refugee boy from Syria hospitalized in Taanayel, Lebanon, is suspected of having polio, health officials say. Dr Zaher Haider, a pediatrician at a Lebanese hospital filled with Syrian refugees, said the boy had already tested negative for meningitis, but World Health Organization officials sent throat and stool samples to Cairo to determine if the boy has polio, NBC News reported.

The child who has polio-like symptoms, has been isolated from others in the hospital, NBC chief medical editor Dr Nancy Snyderman said Tuesday [11 Mar 2014].

Should the test be positive it would be Lebanon's 1st documented case of polio among Syrian refugees in Lebanon, a grave concern because the disease is so contagious it could quickly spread among refugees who have not been vaccinated -- which includes most children born during the conflict now in its 4th year.

More than 1.2 million children recently fled Syria and more than 500 000 Syrian children are currently living as refugees in Lebanon.

The outbreak of paralytic polio among children in Syria last October [2013] triggered the largest-ever consolidated immunization response in the Middle East aiming to vaccinate more than 20 million children in seven countries and territories, WHO officials said.

Syria's immunization rates dropped from more than 90 percent before the conflict to 68 percent last year [2013].

Data in WHO as of 5 Mar 2013 for 2013 data and 4 Mar 2014 for 2014 data.

Highlights of the week
----------------------
- On [28 Feb 2014], UNICEF concluded its tender process which makes accessible sufficient quantities of affordable inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) to support country introductions. The vaccine will now be available to GAVI-supported countries for as little as EUR 0.75 per dose (approximately USD 1 at current exchange rate) in 10-dose vials. The introduction of IPV globally, prior to a phased removal of oral polio vaccines (OPV), is a major element of the comprehensive plan to end all polio disease. More than 120 countries have yet to introduce IPV, more than half of which are eligible for GAVI support. The conclusion of UNICEF's tender ensures that affordable IPV will be made available, removing a major obstacle to global introduction.
- On [27 Feb 2014], the world's leading Islamic scholars, led by the Grand Imam of the Holy Mosque of Mecca, stated that protection against diseases is obligatory and admissible under Islamic Shariah, and that any actions which do not support these preventive measures and cause harm to humanity are un-Islamic. The scholars adopted a strong 'Jeddah Declaration' and a focused 6-month Plan of Action to address critical challenges facing polio eradication efforts in the few remaining polio-endemic parts of the Islamic world: a ban on vaccinations and lack of access to children in some areas, deadly attacks on health workers, and misconceptions by communities about mass vaccination campaigns.
- The Independent Monitoring Board (IMB) issued its letter to the heads of the GPEI [Global Polio Eradication Initiative] partner agencies, following the group's additional meeting 2 weeks ago, and ahead of the group's next regularly meeting on [6-7 May 2014]. The IMB reviewed the current global epidemiology, and expressed concern by the persistent shortfall in funds, seemingly due to significant delays in some donors following through on their pledges.
- In Nigeria, the 1st wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case of 2014 has been reported, from Kano state. It is the 1st WPV1 case in the country since December [2013]. Since September 2013, 7 WPV1 cases have been reported, 5 from Kano. Together with Borno (the location of the last previous case from December [2013]), Kano state holds the key to a polio-free Nigeria.

Afghanistan
-----------
- No new WPV1s were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2013 is 14, and 3 for 2014.
- The most recent WPV1 case had onset of paralysis on [31 Jan 2014] from Kunar province, Eastern Region.
- No new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2013 remains 3. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [13 Mar 2014] (from Kandahar, Southern Region).
- Mop-ups will be held in selected high-risk districts in the south, east and north of the country, with nationwide activities planned for late March [2014], using trivalent OPV.

Nigeria
-------
- One new WPV1 case was reported in the past week, the 1st in 2014. The case had onset of paralysis on [1 Feb 2014], from Gaya Local Government Area (LGA), Kano. The total number of WPV cases for 2013 remains 53 (all WPV1).
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 remains 4. The most recent cVDPV case had onset of paralysis on [24 Dec 2014] (from Maiduguri, Borno), linked to previous transmission in Chad from 2013.
- A full case investigation of this latest WPV1 case has been launched. Technical support to Gaya LGA and surrounding areas was maximised for this week's national Immunization Plus Days (IPDs -- [1-4 Mar 2014], with bivalent OPV), to ensure high-quality implementation, supervision and monitoring.
- The IMB underscored that stopping polio transmission in 2014 is potentially feasible, though far from certain. The group welcomed the country's determination to succeed this year, but warned Nigeria needed continuity and unwavering commitment particularly in the face of election-related distraction. The IMB underscored that the governors of Kano and Borno are vital figures in global polio eradication, and should be strongly supported and encouraged to apply their unique influence at this critical time.
- A sub-national supplementary immunization activity is taking place this week in 11 northern states. The next IPDs are planned for April [2014], using a combination of bivalent and trivalent OPV.

Pakistan
--------
- 3 new WPV1 cases were reported in the past week, all from Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA -- 2 from North Waziristan and 1 from FR Bannu [Frontier Region Bannu]). The total number of cases for 2014 is now 24. The total number of cases for 2013 remains 93. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [14 Feb 2014] (the WPV1 reported this week from FR Bannu).
- No new cVDPV2 case was reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 is 45, and 4 for 2014. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [27 Jan 2014] (from FR Bannu).
- The IMB expressed particular concern at the polio situation in Pakistan, concluding that the country risked being the last place on earth in which polio exists, if current trend continues. While commending some new initiatives, the IMB cautioned that authorities needed to fully grasp the fundamental seriousness of the situation.
- North Waziristan is the district with the largest number of children being paralyzed by poliovirus in the world (both wild and cVDPV2). Immunization activities have been suspended by local leaders since June 2012. It is critical that children in all areas are vaccinated and protected from poliovirus. Immunizations in neighbouring high-risk areas are being intensified, to further boost population immunity levels in those areas and prevent further spread of this outbreak.
- The densely populated Peshawar valley is considered to be the main 'engine' of poliovirus transmission, alongside North Waziristan, due to large-scale population movements through Peshawar from across this region, and into other areas of Pakistan. The quality of operations must be urgently improved in Peshawar, and immunizations resumed in North Waziristan.
- However, at the same time, concerning trends have been noted in greater Karachi, Sindh and in Quetta, Balochistan. Environmental positives isolates from every major city of Punjab confirm widespread virus circulation.
- A sub-national immunization activity and a National Immunization Day are scheduled for [10 Mar 2014] and [24 Mar 2014] respectively.

Central Africa
--------------
- In Cameroon, no new WPV1 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2013 remains 4. The most recent case in Cameroon had onset of paralysis on [30 Oct 2013] (WPV1 from Ouest).
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week in Cameroon. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 remains 4. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [12 Aug 2014] (from Kolfata, Extreme-Nord).
- NIDs were conducted in Cameroon [16-19 Jan 2014] and again [6-10 Feb 2014]. The next NIDs are planned for [7-9 Mar 2014].
- In Chad, no new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The most recent WPV case had onset of paralysis on [14 Jun 2012] (WPV1 from Lac). No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 remains 4 (the most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [12 May 2014] from Ennedi).
- NIDs with trivalent OPV were held from [28 Feb 2014 to 2 Mar 2014] with trivalent OPV, and the next nationwide campaigns are planned for mid- March [2014], using bivalent OPV.

Horn of Africa
--------------
- One new WPV1 case was reported from Somalia in the past week, with onset of paralysis on [8 Aug 2013] from Middle Shabelle. The case was reported late due to laboratory processing backlog.
- The total number of WPV1 cases in the Horn of Africa is now 217 (194 from Somalia, 14 from Kenya and 9 from Ethiopia). The most recent WPV1 case in the region had onset of paralysis on [20 Dec 2013] (from Bari, Somalia).
- Outbreak response across the Horn of Africa is continuing. Recommendations from the recently held Horn of Africa Technical Advisory Group (TAG) are now actively being incorporated into outbreak response planning. The TAG had underscored that the initial response to the outbreak was appropriate, however expressed grave concern that gaps in SIA quality and surveillance remained in key infected areas of the region. Consequently, the group concluded there is a serious risk of the outbreak continuing and of further spread both within and beyond countries of the Horn of Africa. The group recommended that infected countries should focus efforts on high-risk and infected areas, by conducting high-quality SIAs no more than 4 weeks apart.

Israel and West Bank and Gaza
-----------------------------
- WPV1-positive samples have been detected by environmental surveillance in Israel since [3 Feb 2013] and continue to be detected in 2014 (17 positive samples collected this year, the most recent of which was collected on [16 Feb 2014]; in 2013, 169 positive samples were collected).
- Since 2005, only inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) has been used for routine childhood immunization in Israel. To interrupt WPV1 transmission, a nationwide supplementary immunization activity (SIA) with bivalent OPV targeting children less than 10 years of age was conducted from August to October [2013].
- Following a consultation with the country's immunization advisory group, the Israeli Ministry of Health has decided to re-introduce OPV into the national routine immunization schedule.
- Positive environmental samples have also been detected in West Bank and Gaza Strip, the most recent positive sample were collected during the week of [5 Jan 2014].
- SIAs in West Bank and Gaza Strip were conducted [8-15 Dec 2013] and [8-15 Jan 2014].

Middle East
-----------
- One new WPV1 case was reported in the past week (onset of paralysis on [1 Oct 2013] from Deir Al Zour [Syria]). The total number of laboratory-confirmed WPV1 cases is 25. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [17 Dec 2014] and was reported from Mara, Edleb governorate.
- Additionally, there are 13 cases confirmed from contested areas but not yet reflected in official figures.
- In the Middle East, a comprehensive outbreak response continues to be implemented across the region. The most recent SIAs in Syria were held in early January [2014] and early February [2014]. Initial reporting indicates that over 3 million children were reached during both SIAs, with OPV reaching most if not all districts, and coverage attaining more than 85 percent in all but 3 governorates.
- WHO and UNICEF are committed to working with all organizations and agencies providing humanitarian assistance to Syrians affected by the conflict. This includes vaccination of all children no matter where they are, whether in government or contested areas, or outside Syria.
- The WHO/UNICEF Strategic Plan for Polio Outbreak Response in the Middle East outlines the action plan for Syria and neighbouring countries in response to the circulation of wild poliovirus following importation.

West Africa
-----------
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The most recent case in the region was due to WPV1 from Tahoua province in Niger with onset of paralysis on [15 Nov 2012].
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week from Niger. The country has reported a single case of cVDPV2 in 2013, with onset of paralysis on [11 Jul 2014]. Genetic sequencing has shown that the virus is related to that seen in Cameroon, Chad and Nigeria (Borno).
- National campaigns were conducted in West Africa [22-25 Nov 2013]. Further national campaigns are planned for April [2014] and May [2014] (multi-country).

[Unfortunately, the occurrence of a suspected case of paralytic polio in a displaced person camp with Syrian refugees outside of Syria is not totally a surprise. History elsewhere has shown that displaced persons coming from areas of civil unrest where routine health infrastructures have been disrupted and vaccination activities have been significantly impacted, can be exporters/importers of communicable diseases, especially vaccine preventable diseases. A recent case in point was the outbreak in the Horn of Africa involving Somalia, and displaced persons camps with Somali refugees in Kenya and Ethiopia.

In the case of polio, for every 1 paralytic case, there are an average of 200 "silently" infected individuals without paralytic manifestations. Hence, it is easy to understand how the virus can travel from one location to another virtually undetected. In the case of the Middle East countries, there is evidence that WPV1 has been circulating since late 2012 when Egypt identified a WPV1 in environmental samples (sewage samples), documenting that some one (or individuals) had a WPV1 infection and the virus was being excreted into the sewage samples (see Poliomyelitis - worldwide (01): Egypt ex Pakistan, Niger 20130122.1509210). From February 2013 through February 2014, there have been multiple samples of WPV1 isolated from environmental samples throughout Israel, starting in the south and moving northward, yet no paralytic cases associated with a WPV1 infection have been identified.

A positive sign in the region is that acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance is ongoing. It is possible that this current suspected case is due to a non-poliovirus AFP event, and the press coverage a result of heightened awareness of the possible threat outside of Syria. Obviously we await results of the laboratory testing by the reference laboratory in Cairo.

Looking at the global picture, in the approximately one month since the last ProMED-mail global update (Poliomyelitis - update (02): Afghanistan, global 20140215.2271839), the number of confirmed cases have more than doubled, from 11 to 28. The very good news contained in the weekly highlights is the concerted effort to involve religious leaders in promoting vaccination activities, especially in geographic areas where community leaders have taken a religious bias stand against vaccination. Hopefully this will lead to a renewed acceptance of vaccinations and the cessation of violence against vaccinators in these communities.
