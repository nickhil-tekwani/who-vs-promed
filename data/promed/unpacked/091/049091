A 16-year-old Indonesian girl died of bird flu on Tuesday [? 8 Jan
2008], putting the total fatalities to 96 out of 118 cases in the
hardest-hit country, the health ministry said Friday [11 Jan 2008 ].
The girl from Bekasi, an outskirt city of Jakarta, has been treated
at the bird flu-designed hospital of Persahabatan in East Jakarta
since Wednesday [? 9 Jan 2008] after she had been treated at a
hospital in Bekasi since 4 Jan [2008], an official of bird flu center
of the ministry Ahmad Priatna said. All her laboratory tests had
indicated that she [had] positively contracted the H5N1 virus, he said.

The girl consumed 3 half-boiled chickens eggs 2 weeks ago after
scores of chicken died suddenly in her residence in the last 2
months, said Priatna. The girl first showed the symptoms of the
disease with high fever and throat problems on 30 Dec 2007. Then she
went to doctors on 31 Dec 2007 and 2 Jan 2008, said the official.

Contact with fowl is a common cause of the bird flu death in
Indonesia. Indonesia, the world's 4th most populous country and home
to millions of backyard chickens, is considered a possible hot spot
for spreading the bird flu disease. Indonesia has been at the front
row in fighting to combat the spread of the highly pathogenic H5N1
viruses. Millions of people can be killed, and the world economy may
suffer a set back should the virus mutate in a level that can make it
transmittable among humans, experts have said. Indonesia has grappled
with major problems on its effort to stop the spread of the virus
spread, including huge territory and traditional way of rising
chickens on back yard.

[The 16-year-old girl from the Bekasi satellite city of Jakarta in
West Java is the girl reported in ProMED-mail post "Avian influenza,
human (06): Indonesia, WHO 20080111.0150" to be a WHO-confirmed case
of H5N1 virus infection. The report above of the patient's death
confirms probable exposure to infected poultry. Although the girl is
reported to have consumed half-boiled eggs the precise route of
infection is conjectural.
