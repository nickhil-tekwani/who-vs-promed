The Department of Health has announced an outbreak of whooping cough in Eddy County.

20 cases have been or are currently being investigated in Eddy County residents since 1 Nov [2016]. They include 10 school-aged children.

Whooping cough is very contagious and can cause serious illness, especially in infants.

[There are pertussis (whooping cough) outbreaks occurring worldwide, associated with significant morbidity and mortality, especially in infants, variously attributed to increased virulence of outbreak strains, a mismatch between the vaccine strain and the current circulating clones of _Bordetella pertussis_, a waning immune or ineffective immune response after vaccination with the current DTaP and Tdap vaccines, as well as decreased levels of vaccine utilization in some areas. A discussion of these issues can be found in prior ProMED-mail posts (e.g., Pertussis - USA (14) 20151110.3781837 and Pertussis - USA (02) 20130905.1923593).

Eddy County, with a population of 53 829 residents, is located in the U.S. state of New Mexico; its county seat and largest city is Carlsbad (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_County,_New_Mexico). Carlsbad Caverns National Park and the nuclear Waste Isolation Pilot Plant are located in this county. - Mod.ML
