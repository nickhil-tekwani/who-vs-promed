Anthrax is seen in the southern oblasts (regions, provinces) facing the Kyrgyz border, as well as in the eastern oblasts.

Reporting of anthrax in Kazakhstan is sporadic though the risk is enzootic. As horses normally get infected via a biting fly with contaminated mouth-parts, we might presume that there was a prior bovine case in the affected village. There were no outbreaks of anthrax reported in Kazakhstan last year, 2013.
