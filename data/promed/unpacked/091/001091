Rift Valley Fever Death Toll Reaches 100
----------------------------------------
RIYAD: One or more persons died in Asir of Rift Valley fever yesterday [Wed
8 Nov 2000, bringing the death toll to 100, the Health Ministry of Saudi
Arabia announced. This deadly [disease, which first broke out in the
south-western region of Jizan early in September, has so far infected 602
people, mostly in Asir. The government has stepped up the campaign to
eradicate the disease by spraying insecticides in the country's southern
regions to kill the mosquitoes that carry the virus.

[On 233 October 2000, WHO Outbreaks Report - Update 3 stated that 443 cases
of Rift Valley fever with 85 deaths had been reported by the Ministry of
Health of Saudi Arabia. All cases had occurred in Jizan and Asir provinces
and the disease has not spread to the north-west area of the country. On 31
Oct 2000, the Australian Broadcast Co. reported that the number of cases
had risen to 508 with 91 deaths. The declining trend in the rate of
occurrence of cases and deaths predicted in the WHO Report does not yet
appear to be very marked. - Mod.CP
