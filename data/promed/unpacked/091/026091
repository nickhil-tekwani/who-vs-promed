The following background information on Trichinellosis in the former
Yugoslavian republics were abstracted from GIDEON
Croatia reported 25 cases in 1993; 63 in 1994; 115 in 1995; 156 in 1996; 49
in 1997; 298 in 1998. 52 food-borne outbreaks were reported during 1993 to
1998. _Trichinella spiralis_ accounts for most cases of domestic infection.
_T. britovi_ is encountered in some cases of sylvatic trichinosis.

Macedonia reported 3 cases in 1985, and 6 in 1992.

Slovenia reported a single outbreak (8 cases from pork sausage served in a
private home) in 1994.

Yugoslav Republic:
Until recent years, most cases were reported from Srem, Macva and
Negotinska (Krajina); however, additional areas are increasingly involved.
555 cases of human infection were attributed to pork ingestion in 1999.

Although infection of horses has not been detected in Serbia, Serbian
horses have been implicated as a source for human infection in France and
Italy. 0.17 percent of slaughtered swine are infested (1999).

1806 cases (2 fatal) were reported during 1996 to 1996 - most from pork.
210 cases were reported in 1993; 493 in 1994; 803 in 1995; 598 in 1996; 804
in 1997; 471 in 1998. Rates per 100,000: 1.9 in 1993; 4.6 in 1994; 7.4 in
1995; 5.5 in 1996; 7.4 in 1997; 4.4 in 1998.
Rates during 1995 to 1998 included 24.8/100 000 in the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia, 13.9/100 000 in Montenegro, 17.3/100 000 in the Republic of
Serbia, 4.6/100 000 in Voivodina and 0.23/100 000 in Kosovo.

Horsemeat imported from Yugoslavia was responsible for 2 outbreaks in
France during 1998 (128 cases, 79 confirmed). An additional outbreak in the
same region that year involved 404 cases (37 hospitalised), also from a
horse imported from Yugoslavia.

In 1999, 8 cases were diagnosed among Yugoslavian immigrants in the United
Kingdom (West London and Hertfordshire) - ascribed to salami imported from
the town of Sombor (northern Serbia). Forty to 80 local residents of Sombor
were also infected during the outbreak. 0.12% of slaughtered swine are
infested (1999).

Travellers and Trichinellosis
-----------------------------
Although the region practically doesn't see any classical tourists at the
moment I think it is also important news for colleagues involved in travel
medicine: Experience with Trichinella-infections/infestations is small in
most countries of the western hemisphere (I saw one case originating from
this region 10 years ago) but especially foreign workers based in central
Europe belong to the highest risk group: VFRs (visiting friends and
relatives - persons who practically cannot escape this way of transmission
being hosted and served all day long with local food).
