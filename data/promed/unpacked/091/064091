State Department of Public Health [DPH] testing has shown that 8 people became ill in 2012 from eating bacteria-laden oysters, despite brand new regulations that were specifically designed to keep consumers safe.

Until the DPH traced 2 _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ cases back to Cape oysters in 2011, the state had never seen that particular gastrointestinal illness caused by oysters harvested in Massachusetts waters. The state's colder waters and climate seemed to discourage the growth of the bacteria, which have a reproductive rate that jumps dramatically with higher water and air temperatures.

One reason for this year's [2012] higher number of cases may be increased awareness by the public and medical professionals, leading to more testing and reporting, DPH Associate Commissioner Suzanne Condon wrote in an email to the Times. But her agency also believes warmer water and air temperatures this past summer [2012] were primary factors.

The Blue Hill Observatory in Milton reported that every month so far in 2012 has been above the mean temperatures tracked from 1891 to 2010, including the 3rd-warmest April, the 6th-warmest May, the 7th-warmest July, and the warmest August on record.

Sea surface temperatures this past year were also the highest ever recorded in the Northeast.

The confirmation of the 2 cases in 2011 prompted the federal government to require the state to create a vibrio management plan. Since vibrio population numbers double every 15 minutes, the primary goal is to inhibit growth by cooling the shellfish. The plan requires that shellfishermen shade their oysters from the sun immediately upon harvesting them and either put them on ice or refrigerate them within 5 hours. A wholesaler has 10 hours to bring the oysters' internal temperature down below 50 deg [F/10 deg C] and keep them at that temperature until they reach consumers.

The 8 cases in 2012 involved oysters from Wellfleet, Orleans, Edgartown, Duxbury, Kingston, Barnstable, and Dennis. The management plan covers 9 communities along the eastern shore of Cape Cod Bay from Sandwich to Provincetown, where extreme tides and shallow waters give the sun time to bake the oysters on the flats.

The DPH will be evaluating the effectiveness of the vibrio plan in light of this year's [2012] cases and could possibly expand coverage to additional towns and/or place limits on the time of year when raw oysters can be harvested and sold, according to Condon. "That would be devastating," said Bob Wallace, a Wellfleet aquaculturist and president of the Massachusetts Aquaculture Association about summer restrictions. "Not prime time to eat them -- the fall is the beautiful oyster (season) -- but it's when (tourists) are here."

While the 8 cases in the state seem like a big jump, some scientists and industry officials believe the vibrio plan will work. "There's no question it will solve the problem," said Dale Leavitt, an associate professor and aquaculture specialist for Roger Williams University in Bristol, Rhode Island. Leavitt said there are other links in the chain, such as wholesalers, restaurants, and fish markets that also handle the product before it reaches consumers. "It's going to take a while. All it takes is one person not doing it right, and it all comes back on the growers," he said.

The DPH inspected 39 wholesale seafood distributors this year to check on compliance, according to Condon.

[It is important to stress that _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ is naturally present in marine waters and does not imply sewage contamination, as would be the case with _Salmonella_ sp. or _E. coli_. It is most common in warmer waters such as those of the American Gulf Coast, but warmer waters in more northern climates can also be associated with oyster-associated _V. parahaemolyticus_.

In 2005, a New England Journal of Medicine report highlighted this infection linked to even Alaskan oysters:
McLaughlin JB, DePaola A, Bopp CA, et al: Outbreak of _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ Gastroenteritis Associated with Alaskan Oysters. N Engl J Med 2005; 353(14): 1463-70 (full article available at http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa051594).

"Abstract
---------
Background: _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_, the leading cause of seafood-associated gastroenteritis in the USA, typically is associated with the consumption of raw oysters gathered from warm water estuaries. We describe a recognized outbreak of _V. parahaemolyticus_ infection associated with the consumption of seafood from Alaska.

Methods: After we received reports of the occurrence of gastroenteritis on a cruise ship, we conducted a retrospective cohort study among passengers, as well as active surveillance throughout Alaska to identify additional cases, and an environmental study to identify sources of _V. parahaemolyticus_ and contributors to the outbreak.

Results: Of 189 passengers, 132 (70 percent) were interviewed; 22 of the interviewees (17 percent) met our case definition of gastroenteritis. In our multiple logistic-regression analysis, consumption of raw oysters was the only significant predictor of illness; the attack rate among people who consumed oysters was 29 percent. Active surveillance identified a total of 62 patients with gastroenteritis. _V. parahaemolyticus_ serotype O6:K18 was isolated from the majority of patients tested and from environmental samples of oysters. Patterns on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis were highly related across clinical and oyster isolates. All oysters associated with the outbreak were harvested when mean daily water temperatures exceeded 15.0 deg C (59 deg F) (the theorized threshold for the risk of _V. parahaemolyticus_ illness from the consumption of raw oysters). Since 1997, mean water temperatures in July and August at the implicated oyster farm increased 0.21 deg C per year (P less than 0.001 by linear regression); 2004 was the only year during which mean daily temperatures in July and August 2004 at the shellfish farm did not drop below 15.0 deg C (59 deg F).

Conclusions: This investigation extends by 1000 km (621 mi) the northernmost documented source of oysters that caused illness due to _V. parahaemolyticus_. Rising temperatures of ocean water seem to have contributed to one of the largest known outbreaks of _V. parahaemolyticus_ in the USA." - Mod.LL
