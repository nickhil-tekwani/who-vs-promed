According to the Jan 3, 1998 paper edition of "O Estado de Sao Paulo"(p.
A7), a Sao Paulo-based Brazilian daily, the Brazilian Ministry of
Agriculture has imposed a temporary ban on the importation from any country
of ostriches and ornamental birds, including embryonated eggs, as
protection from Newcastle disease and bird influenza. The spokesperson for
the Ministry of Agriculture emphasized that this has nothing to do with the
recent bird influenza episode in Hong Kong.

[The New Zealanders have also recognised this import trade as posing a
possible risk of importing the above infections. Considering the dubious
commercial value and the pyramid schemes associated with ratite species,
the loss to Brazil from this ban is probably slight or even negative.
Plus, in the past a number of North American breeding flocks were afflicted
with avian tuberculosis and the infection went with dispersal and culling
sales. Presumably the same situation occurred elsewhere. - Mod.MHJ
