A case of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) has been
recorded recently in the Kursk Oblast. The 1st case of HFRS in the
oblast was registered in 1997, and the 5 year cumulative incidence in
Kursk was 39. The press service of Rospotrebnadzor [the Russian
Federal Agency for Protection of Customer Rights and Human Welfare]
has stated that stable reservoirs of HFRS are present in several
regions of the oblast. This has been confirmed by serological surveys
of rodent populations and the regular occurrence of human cases in
these territories.

[The public health authorities of the Kursk Oblast have ordered mass
destruction of rodent populations. Additionally, unauthorized
landfills have been eliminated, and local programmes for infection
control are being developed. The 1st cases of HFRS appeared in the
Kursk Oblast in 1997. Since then, single cases have been registered
regularly. There were a relatively high number of cases (9) in
2006/2007 due to an abnormally warm winter and an increased
population of small rodents, and HFRS cases were registered also in
neighboring oblasts. - Corr.BA]

[HFRS in Russia is caused predominantly by the hantavirus _Pumala
virus_. Control of the rodent population and contact avoidance are
the best prevention.
