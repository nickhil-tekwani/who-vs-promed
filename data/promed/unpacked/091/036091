[As the volume of postings on this unfolding outbreak and investigation has
been considerable, we have decided to separate reports into different
posting threads. In this report we are focusing on the numbers of cases
reported and transmission. Information on the identification of the
etiologic agent and development of specific diagnostic tests will be
covered separately as has been done by the issuing of separate "stand
alone" posts in the past week. To allow room for more informative titles,
we will now use the generally accepted acronym SARS for severe acute
respiratory syndrome and add qualifiers to the subject line. - Mod.MPP]

Update (10) on SARS cases in Singapore
--------------------------------------
As of 23 Mar 2003, a total of 51 people with SARS have been reported to the
Ministry of Health. The 7 additional patients reported today comprise 3
hospital staff and 4 close contacts of patients. 3 patients have been
discharged from hospital. The other 48 patients are still in hospital. All
the patients are stable except for 9 patients who are in a serious condition.
To date, apart from the 3 initial people who had travelled to Hong Kong, a
total of 24 family, friends and those who had close contacts with the
cases, and 24 hospital staff have been diagnosed with SARS. So far, all the
cases of SARS have been linked to the initial 3 cases. No new index cases
have been reported. In addition, no further cases have occurred among
hospital staff as a result of infection from known or suspected cases of
SARS after the implementation of enhanced infection control precautions.
All suspected and probable cases, including pediatric cases, will be
managed centrally at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) and the Centre for
Communicable Diseases. This will facilitate the management of these
patients and reduce the risk of secondary transmission of the disease.
To free up TTSH's resources to isolate and treat all SARS cases, TTSH will
not admit new patients for the next 2 weeks. As such, ambulance cases will
be diverted to other hospitals and the public is advised to seek accident
and emergency care at other hospitals.

HONG KONG (Reuters): Hong Kong researchers said on Saturday they had
isolated the virus, found it was new, and designed the first diagnostic
test, meaning patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) can be
identified, and therefore treated, much faster. On Sunday WHO praised the
Hong Kong's team's findings but sounded a note of caution. "The race to
identify the SARS causative agent is by no means over. Although the virus
has now been isolated, its identity remains elusive," the global body said.
The majority of cases are medical workers who have been in close contact
with patients or victims' family members. In Hong Kong health officials
said 2 people who worked in the same office as a patient were infected at
work. [Other newswire reports have mentioned 3 cases among office workers.
We await official news from the Department of Health on these reports. -
Mod.MPP]
Authorities in the territory ordered all schools to be disinfected and
vowed on Sunday to shut for a week any school with a child or staff member
ill with the disease. Education secretary Arthur Li told a news conference
he was ordering about 180 children with infected family members to stop
attending classes for a week from Monday. Officials say 5 schools have
already been ordered shut.
Scientists in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Germany, and Canada identified viruses
taken from patients as paramyxoviruses, a large family of microbes that
includes germs that cause measles, mumps, and respiratory infections. WHO
said other research groups in the network of collaborating labs were
producing hints the virus might belong to another family but also expressed
hope of bringing the epidemic under control.
The University of Hong Kong researchers said on Saturday they had designed
the world's first SARS diagnostic test, which detects a patient's
antibodies, which could confirm the diagnosis between 5 and 14 days after
infection. Hong Kong doctors have been treating patients with ribavirin --
an anti-virus drug -- and corticosteroids. They say the regimen works for
most patients if treated early.
Hong Kong Hospital Authority director Ko Wing-man said on Sunday one more
patient had died in Hong Kong, bringing the death toll in the city to 8.
The number of infections in Hong Kong rose to 247 on Sunday, including 242
suffering full-blown pneumonia.
