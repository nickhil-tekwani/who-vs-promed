UNDIAGNOSED DISEASE, COFFEE - TANZANIA (MBEYA)

Experts from the Tanzania Coffee Research Institute (TACRI) are studying a
new type of coffee disease that has erupted in Mbozi District [Mbeya
region]. Agriculture officers in the district have told coffee growers that
the disease, which kills coffee plants by drying them up, has no cure at
the moment.
This was said in parliament yesterday [22 Jun 2007] by the deputy minister
for agriculture, food security and cooperatives, Mr Christopher Chiza, when
responding to a question posed by Mr Godfrey Zambi (Mbozi East). The MP
[member of parliament] wanted to know whether the government would send
experts to study the problem and determine ways and means of tackling it.
He said growers in the district were in danger of being impoverished.
Mr Chiza said coffee disease experts from TACRI would study the disease
exhaustively and identify it. But he said a solution was not likely to
arrive soon. He advised growers in the district to start planting a new
variety of coffee that has been developed at TACRI Lyamungu. The new
variety also withstands diseases such as coffee leaf rust and is not
attacked by white coffee stem borers, mealy bugs, green scales, and leaf
miners. He said only coffee leaf rust is known to have no cure.
He also said the soil in Mbozi district may have run out of fertilizer
after years of repeated cultivation. Meanwhile, the deputy minister said
the country needs to rehabilitate the infrastructure of 50 irrigation
schemes, which have been damaged by rains.

[Two species of coffee are being grown commercially: _Coffea arabica_
(Arabica or highland coffee) and _Coffea canephora_ (Robusta or lowland
coffee). Arabica is usually preferred for its taste, but Robusta is also
grown widely. Over 30 pathogens, many of them fungal, have been reported to
cause diseases in coffea.
According to TACRI, in Tanzania the most common problems for coffee
plantations are physiological weakness, a number of insect pests and leaf
rust, which causes significant damage. The presence of coffee wilt disease
(CWD) has been confirmed, but it was exclusively found on Robusta coffee in
the Kagera region. Other diseases on root and bark are reported to be of
limited importance at the national level. Development of disease resistant
coffee varieties is being undertaken.
Coffee wilt, also called tracheomycosis, is caused by the fungus _Fusarium
xylarioides_. Previously, the disease only occurred sporadically in Africa,
but it has recently become more virulent. It is now reported to be present
in Ethiopia, Tanzania, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo on
Robusta coffee varieties only. Spread occurs via infected plant material
and soil.
Coffee leaf rust (CLR) is caused by the fungus _Hemileia vastatrix_ and
affects Arabica varieties only. It is widespread and has destroyed Arabica
coffee plantings in many countries. Some of these areas have been replanted
with CLR-resistant Robusta varieties, and some areas have switched to other
crops (for example tea in Sri Lanka). CLR spores are spread by wind and
rain from lesions on the underside of the leaves.
Symptoms of both CWD and CLR are well known in Tanzania. The disease
referred to above therefore may be one that is new to this country.
