A suspected anthrax case has been admitted to the hospital in Aksi
------------------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Emergency Situations of Kyrgyzstan has reported that
there is a possibility of an anthrax outbreak in Aksiskoe rayon of
Jalalabad oblast. The ministry report says that a cow belonging to [a
male] from the village of Semet fell sick and was slaughtered by
[him] on 18 Jul 2009. [He] found a boil on his finger on 19 Jul 2009,
which he treated with cigarette ash and vodka. He sought medical help
on 26 Jul 2009 and was hospitalized on 27 Jul 2009 with suspicion of anthrax.

The cow's slaughter place has been disinfected with chloramine.
Specimens of meat, soil and hide have been submitted for laboratory
analysis. [This] cow had been immunized for anthrax already. There
are no other suspected animal anthrax cases around and outbreak
containment measures are being taken.

Two doctors and 5 nurses from the regional sanepid station (sanitary
and epidemiological control station) are administering tetracycline
prophylaxis. Veterinarians are vaccinating the animals in the same
pasture where the index cow was. A total of 12 people in contact with
the patient are under the observation of health care professionals.

[Anthrax is an endemic problem in Jalalabad in western Kyrgyzstan; it
overflows from adjoining Uzbekistan. Confirmation is being sought
from Bishkek on the cause of death for this cow. - Mod.MHJ
