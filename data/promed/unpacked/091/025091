Abstract
--------
Background: During the 2018 West Nile virus (WNV) transmission season, similarly to other endemic areas in Europe, a large number of human WNV infections were reported in Hungary.

Aims: We summarise the epidemiological and laboratory findings of the 2018 transmission season and expand experiences in flavivirus differential diagnostics.

Methods: Every patient with clinical suspicion of acute WNV infection was in parallel tested for WNV, tickborne encephalitis virus and Usutu virus (USUV) by serological methods. Sera, whole blood and urine samples were also tested for the presence of viral nucleic acid.

Results: Until the end of December 2018, 215 locally acquired and 10 imported human WNV infections were notified in Hungary. All reported cases were symptomatic; most of them exhibited neurological symptoms. In a large proportion of tested individuals, whole blood was the most appropriate sample type for viral nucleic acid detection, but because whole blood samples were not always available, testing of urine samples also extended diagnostic possibilities. In addition, the 1st human USUV infection was confirmed in 2018 in a patient with aseptic meningitis. Serological cross-reactions with WNV in different serological assays were experienced, but subsequent molecular biological testing and sequence analysis identified Europe lineage 2 USUV infection.

Conclusion: Careful interpretation and simultaneous application of different laboratory methods are necessary to avoid misdiagnosis of human USUV cases. Expansion of the laboratory-confirmed case definition criteria for detection of viral RNA in any clinical specimens to include urine samples could increase diagnostic sensitivity.

["West Nile virus (WNV) and Usutu virus (USUV) are phylogenetically closely related mosquito-borne members of the family _Flaviviridae_, and belong to the Japanese encephalitis antigenic complex of the _Flavivirus genus_ (1,2). Both viruses have been isolated from numerous ornithophilic mosquito species, mainly _Culex_ spp. (1,2). In the enzootic cycle of WNV and USUV, avian species are also involved and serve as amplifying hosts. Mosquitoes facilitate virus transmission to humans and equids which then remain incidental hosts as they are not able to produce a level of viraemia sufficient for further virus transmission by mosquito bites (2)." (see https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2019.24.28.1900038 for complete reference list, including those cited here).

WNV infections are defined as laboratory-confirmed or probable cases according to the EU case definition criteria (see https://eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2018.23.32.1800428). For laboratory case confirmation, at least one of the following 4 criteria must be met:

- isolation of the virus from blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF);
- detection of WNV nucleic acid in blood or CSF;
- detection of WNV-specific IgM antibodies in CSF; or
- detection in serum of anti-WNV IgM antibodies at high titre and detection of anti-WNV IgG antibodies and confirmation by neutralisation.

The presence of WNV-specific antibodies in a serum sample allows only probable case classification. Laboratory results need to be interpreted according to flavivirus vaccination status.

Due to cross-reactivity between flaviviruses, many Usutu infections remain unrecognised. The case reported here also underlines consideration of Usutu virus as a causative agent for neurological disease. As with any flavivirus, cross-reactivity between viral antigens is the greatest drawback for proper serologic diagnosis. It is imperative that use of serological tests is supplemented by confirmatory molecular assays to differentiate WNV and USUV infections. - Mod.UBA

Although the above report states that this is the 1st report of human Usutu virus infection, they surely must mean in Hungary, or in Hungary in 2018. The 1st human cases of USUV infection were detected in northern Italy in 2009 in immunocompromised patients (https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/ese.14.50.19446-en). Subsequent seroprevalence studies and retrospective investigations suggested that the prevalence of USUV infection in humans could be higher than WNV infection (estimated to range between 0.3% and 3%) in areas where both viruses co-circulate (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jmv.25230). A January 2019 publication indicated that USUV spread to Hungary in 2003 to 2006, and a phylogenetic analysis of USUV isolates placed a 2016 Hungary isolate in the Europe 2 clade (https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2019.24.3.1800649). With USUV infections occurring in birds and in humans in Central Europe, it is not surprising that USUV human infections occur in Hungary, underscoring the need to be able to differentiate those cases from WNV cases. - Mod.TY

[2] ECDC situation update

Since the beginning of the 2019 transmission season and as of 11 Jul 2019, no human West Nile virus (WNV) infection has been reported in EU member states and EU-neighbouring countries. The 1st equine outbreak has been reported to the Animal Disease Notification System this week in Xanthi, Greece.

A WNV-infected bird has been reported on 10 Jul 2019 in Wittenberg, Sachsen-Anhalt, Germany. Last year [2018], WNV was detected for the 1st time in resident wild and aviary birds in eastern and south eastern Germany.

In accordance with European Commission Directive 2014/110/EU, prospective blood donors should be deferred for 28 days after leaving an area with evidence of WNV circulation among humans unless the results of an individual nucleic acid test are negative.
