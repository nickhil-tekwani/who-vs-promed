Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments
The affected farm has 8 separately managed sites which are at least 1km [0.62 mi] apart. One of the 8 sites was affected, a parent breeding unit for broilers with 83 000 birds. A total of 3045 birds died within a week at this site showing signs consistent with highly pathogenic avian influenza. The affected site is close to a small dam where there are a number of different migratory waterfowl, which are tentatively suspected to be source of infection.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country, surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone, surveillance within containment and/or protection zone, screening, traceability, quarantine, official destruction of animal products, official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste, stamping out, zoning, disinfection, vaccination prohibited, no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures
