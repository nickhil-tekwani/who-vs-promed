A dead cow on a British farm was infected with mad cow disease, officials have revealed. Experts are urgently working to investigate the circumstances of the case, which is the 1st in Wales since 2013. It was discovered as a result of control measures, which see all animals over 4 years old that die on farms tested for the disease. The animal did not enter the food chain and there is no risk to human health, the Food Standards Agency and Public Health Wales said.

The identity of the farm has not yet been revealed. Rebecca Evans, the Welsh Assembly's deputy minister for farming and food, said there had been a number of sporadic cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) across Britain in recent years. She said: 'Identification of this case demonstrates that the controls we have in place are working well. Beef across the UK continues to be produced in compliance with the World Organisation for Animal Health rules.' She added that while the disease was not directly transmitted from animal to animal, the dead cow's cohorts, including offspring, had been traced, and would be destroyed in line with EU rules.

The last case of mad cow disease was confirmed in 2014. There were 3 in 2013.

Humans can contract Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (vCJD) if beef products contaminated with central nervous system tissue from cattle infected with mad cow disease are eaten.

Mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), is a fatal neurological disease in cattle caused by an abnormal protein that destroys the brain and spinal cord.

The disease was first identified in Great Britain in 1986, although research suggests the 1st infections may have spontaneously occurred in the 1970s.

It is believed to be spread by feeding calves meat and bone meal contaminated with BSE.

Humans can contract Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (vCJD) if beef products contaminated with central nervous system tissue from cattle infected with mad cow disease are eaten. There is no treatment and 177 people have been killed by the variant.

There were 36 000 diagnosed cases of mad cow disease in Great Britain in 1992, leading to British beef exports being banned and dozens of people dying. In August 1996, a British coroner ruled that a 20-year old vegetarian who died of vCJD, contracted the disease from eating beef burgers as a child. The verdict was the first to legally link a human death to mad cow disease. The last case of mad cow disease was confirmed in 2014.

[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is a fatal prion disease that affects primarily cattle. It belongs to a group of diseases called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) that affect the brain and nervous system of humans and animals. In cattle, it may present clinically with apprehension, hyper-reactivity, and ataxia. Without an isolatable causal agent, cases can only be conclusively confirmed post-mortem by the accumulation in the central nervous system (CNS) of prion protein (PrP Sc, PrP d, or PrP res), a partially protease-resistant isoform of a host-encoded protein (PrP C ). The prion hypothesis proposes that the agent is composed entirely of PrP Sc, which is capable of inducing conversion of PrP C.

BSE was first diagnosed in 1986 in the UK, and later in other European countries as well as in some countries in Asia and North America, most probably by the consumption of prion-contaminated meat-and-bone meals at young age. Since 1989, the European Commission and the EU member states have put in place a comprehensive series of measures to manage the risk of BSE in the European Union (EU).

BSE can be divided into classical BSE and atypical BSE. At present, only the infectious agent causing classical BSE has been demonstrated to be transmissible to humans. Since 2003, reports of variant pathology and/or molecular characteristics in aged cattle from several countries have indicated possible agent strain variation. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has developed a laboratory protocol on how to conduct new studies for investigating the presence of the agent of atypical BSE, which differs from those typically found during the UK epidemic in tissues of infected cattle. An interesting common feature is that most of these variant characteristics originate from older cattle. Initial bioassay data support the hypothesis that these isolates are biologically distinct from classical BSE. It is not known whether atypical cases have any relevance to forms of human prion diseases. At present, these atypical cases appear as 2 distinct types classified by the molecular mass of the unglycosylated PrP res protein band relative to that of classical BSE. One type is of a higher molecular mass (H-type) and the other shows a lower molecular mass (L-type).

In May 2015, during the 83rd General Session, the OIE World Assembly of Delegates recognized UK (including Wales) as a country having a "controlled BSE risk in accordance with Chapter 11.4. of the Terrestrial Code". This OIE's list of countries according to their BSE status is available at http://www.oie.int/animal-health-in-the-world/official-disease-status/bse/list-of-bse-risk-status.

For further information, subscribers are referred to OIE Code Chapter 11.4, as well as to OIE's Manual chapter 2.4.6., where parts of the above information have been derived from. The Code chapter is available at http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_bse.htm (article 11.4.4 addresses countries having a "controlled BSE risk" status). Chapter 2.4.6 of the Manual is available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.04.06_BSE.pdf.

An official confirmation of the suspected Welsh case and -- in case confirmed -- its nature ("classical" or "atypical") is requested. - Mod.AS
