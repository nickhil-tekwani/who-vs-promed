[Further information on the Bluetongue situation in Israel is
provided by the comprehensive comments by Mod.AS referenced below. A
few salient points bear repeating here:
- there is regular BT activity in Israel but it is limited in scope;
- October to November is the peak of activity for the virus and
imported and European crossbred sheep, such as the Assaf breed are
known to be susceptible.
Of course, with the recent activity of Bluetongue in Europe and the
Mediterranean, it is rather important to know the strain of
Bluetongue virus in this outbreak. - Mod.PC]
