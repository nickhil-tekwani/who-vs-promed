Epidemic jaundice in Bangladesh, if the disease involves adolescents and
adults, should be characterized. If the illness is classical acute
hepatitis (i.e. brief prodrome of constitutional symptoms followed by
resolution of fever and intensifying jaundice, abdominal pain, anorexia,
nausea, and weakness) the etiology is presumably viral. The most likely
etiology is hepatitis E; this is the most common cause of acute hepatitis
in neighboring India, Nepal, and Pakistan. Virtually all adolescents and
adults in rural areas of the Indian subcontinent are immune to hepatitis A,
the only other recognized form of epidemic hepatitis. Although no
epidemics of HEV have been reported from Bangladesh, cases of hepatitis E
in military personnel have been confirmed by virus detection (RT-PCR) and
serology.
Clarification of the magnitude of the HEV problem in Bangladesh is needed.
If this is not hepatitis E, there is a possibility that a novel agent is
involved. Implication of a novel agent of hepatitis would be quite
important.
If the local or national authorities want laboratory consultation to
determine the etiology of jaundice, they can consult Chief, Department of
Virology, Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences (AFRIMS),
Bangkok, Thailand, FAX # +(66)-2-644-4760
