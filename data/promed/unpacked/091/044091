[The 1st case of contagious equine metritis (CEM) was diagnosed in
1977 near Newmarket in the UK. Since then it first spread to the
United States and then to several parts of Europe. Canada, Australia,
and Japan have had an outbreak and now of course, there is a diagnosis
in the Middle East. It is difficult to pin down the exact geographic
distribution as the disease is difficult to diagnose.

For more information on the recent extensive outbreak in the United
States see USDA-APHIS information sheet and references at
