Acute Encephalitis Death Following H1N1 Influenza Virus Infection
-----------------------------------------------------------------
A 6-year-old girl has died in hospital after [an infection with an
influenza virus strain] which had never previously killed anyone in the
Special Administrative Region (SAR) [Hong Kong]. Health authorities said
the immediate cause of death was acute encephalitis, and although the New
Caledonian strain of H1N1 [influenza virus] was present, it was not clear
whether it had contributed to her death. The girl died in Queen Mary
Hospital on 24 Dec 2000.
The New Caledonian strain [of H1N1 influenza virus] has been causing flu
outbreaks around the world since 1999 when first detected in the South
Pacific island. From Jan to Nov 2000, 651 people had been infected with
this strain of influenza virus in the SAR, according to the Government's
surveillance programme. Dr. Lo Wing-lok, a legislator and infectious
diseases expert, said acute encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) was
not a common complication of influenza virus infection.
A Department spokesman said H1N1 viruses had been circulating in the local
community since 1977 and [most] people would have some protection.
Currently the dominant flu strain in Hong Kong is the Sydney H3N2 strain,
with 1162 falling ill from Jan to Nov 2000. The Hospital Authority said it
monitored the condition of flu patients who sought consultation at public
hospitals.
The H1N1 strain, discovered in 1957, caused the Russian flu epidemic of
1977-78, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta. First isolated in northern China, the Russian flu spread rapidly
and caused epidemic disease in children and adults under 23 worldwide.
