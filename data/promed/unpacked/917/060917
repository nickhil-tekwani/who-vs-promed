Referring to human rabies cases in Thailand as reported by Drs. Henry Wilde
and K. Singh, I would like to add further information. Between May 10 and
23, 1999, we have had a total of 4 rabies cases at Chulalongkorn University
Hospital and at Promitr Hospital. These included those 2 cases that
Dr.Wilde mentioned. All had been bitten by street dogs. None of them had
post exposure prophylaxis (PEP). One of them went to a governmental
hospital but ended up having no treatment. He could not afford the cost of
PEP (only 1,400 baht equivalent to US $40, intradermal tissue culture
vaccine and equine rabies immune globulin). The other chose to use herbal
medicine. Quacks still have their job since mortality rate of individuals
who have been exposed to a true rabid dog varied between 30 - 80%. The
remaining two (16 and 17 year old students) ignored the importance of PEP.
All of these reflected poor general knowledge, a still- popular belief and
use of herbal medicinal products, and worst of all, ignorance of the public
health sector to deliver the best care to people exposed to this deadly
disease. PEP for rabies is free at most of the governmental and all
university hospitals and also at Queen Saovabha Memorial Institute, Thai
Red Cross.
