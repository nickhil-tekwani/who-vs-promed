Health officials are alerting the public about a rabies case involving a deceased Bath County dog. The Gateway District Health Department announced the rabies was of skunk variant.

The department encourages pet owners to get their animals vaccinated to prevent the spread of infection. This is mating season for many animals, which means there could be an increased number of cases.

Kentucky Wildlife Center director Sam Opp said skunks are probably the 2nd most common carrier of rabies.

You should contact your local health department if you encounter an animal acting strangely.

[2] Vermont - coyote, human exposure

A coyote that attacked a Salisbury couple outside their home tested positive for rabies, Vermont's top Fish and Wildlife official said Wednesday [3 Apr 2019].

[The 76-year-old woman] said Wednesday [3 Apr 2019] she and her husband had just fed their horse and barn cat on Monday [1 Apr 2019] when the coyote started lunging at them as they headed back to their Addison County house. [She said] she was bitten several times while [her husband] was scratched.

"We see them out in the fields, and they turn and run because they are afraid of us," [She said]. "Not this one. He was out of his mind."

[Her 79-year-old husband] shot and killed the coyote with a shotgun. Both [individuals] are now receiving a series of shots to prevent rabies, according to Fish and Wildlife Commissioner Louis Porter.

Senior game warden Dale Whitlock sent the carcass for testing. The Vermont Health Department confirmed Wednesday [3 Apr 2019] the coyote was rabid.

Porter said coyote attacks on humans are rare but not unknown. He cited a handful of cases in the past 30 years, but none of those animals were known to have been infected with rabies.

Whitlock said the coyote carcass smelled of skunk and it's likely that's how the animal contracted the rabies virus.

[Sadly, neither of these articles indicate the communities are holding rabies vaccine clinics or doing much to remind people to get their pets vaccinated. Vaccination is one of the best barriers between you and the disease. It is not just people who get bitten or come into contact with rabid animals; our pets do as well. When our pets encounter rabid animals and we are unaware of the interaction, an unvaccinated pet may bring the disease into our home. Please vaccinate your pets. - Mod.TG
