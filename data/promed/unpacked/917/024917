This Friday [30 Jan 2015] in the morning hours, the death of a 53-year-old patient was registered with hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome [HPS] in Los Santos province, becoming the 3rd death of 2014 in this region, [attributed to 2014] due to the patient's hospitalization since December of last year.

Also, information was mentioned on 2 patients most affected with this disease [in 2014]: a 27-year-old woman and a 37-year-old man from the Tonosi district [Los Santos province], who were admitted to the intensive care unit of a hospital in this locality, where they received corresponding medical attention.

So far in 2015, 3 people have been diagnosed with this condition.

[Los Santos province is endemic for Choclo hantavirus. Last year (2014), the province had 75 reported hantavirus infections, a higher case number than usual. Although not specified in the report above or the previous ones, the hantavirus most likely involved is Choclo virus, since it is the only hantavirus known to cause HPS with hospitalizations in Panama. The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents occur in and around agricultural areas and adjacent houses and buildings. The health authorities' call for residents to maintain cleanliness in their houses and surrounding areas is to avoid attracting these rodents.
