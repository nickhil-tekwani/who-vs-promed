Diseased birds have died of Type E botulism in Mason County, marking
the 1st time the disease has been seen that far south on Lake
Michigan's shore.

The infected birds included ring-billed gulls and double-crested
cormorants found dead in Ludington State Park in July 2008.

The state Department of Natural Resources said Friday [8 Aug 2008]
that the bacteria and the toxin it produces are picked up by birds
eating mussels and invasive round gobies that carry the bacteria.

Birds also may be sickened by scavenging carcasses of birds or fish
that have died from the disease.

DNR officials say anyone along Lake Michigan who comes across dead
water birds should make sure pets don't come in contact with them.
Precautions can be found on the Emerging Diseases Web site.
