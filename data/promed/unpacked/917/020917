EVENT DESCRIPTION
-----------------
The outbreak of yellow fever in Nigeria, initially notified to WHO on [Fri 15 Sep 2017] by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), has evolved. The index case was a 7-year-old girl from Oro-Ago community in Ifelodun Local Government Area (LGA), Kwara State who developed acute jaundice syndrome on [Wed 16 Aug 2017]. On [Tue 29 Aug 2017], specimens from the case-patient tested positive for yellow fever virus at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH) laboratory by polymerase chain reaction. The specimens, subsequently referred to the Institute Pasteur Dakar (IPD), con firmed yellow fever virus infection using plaque reduction neutralization test (PNRT).

Following confirmation of yellow fever in the index case, the NCDC deployed a national rapid response team to conduct extensive outbreak investigation, and surveillance for acute jaundice syndrome was enhanced in the country. As of [Thu 26 Oct 2017], a total of 166 cases of acute jaundice syndrome and 10 deaths (case fatality rate 6 percent) have been reported from 6 states (namely Abia, Borno, Kwara, Kogi, Plateau, and Zamfara). Blood specimens were collected from 83 (50 percent) suspected cases and sent to 3 Nigerian national laboratories. Of these, 25 of the 83 (30 percent) specimens tested positive for yellow fever by PCR at the Nigerian laboratories and 17 specimens were subsequently shipped to IPD for further analysis. By [Fri 27 Oct 2017], 3 specimens (2 from Kogi and one from Kwara) have been confirmed by PRNT by IPD, 5 specimens tested negative and 9 results are pending. Of the 3 confirmed cases 2 died, giving a case fatality rate of 66.7 percent in this group.

PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIONS
---------------------
- The response to the yellow fever outbreak is being coordinated by a multi- agency, multi-partner Incident Command at the national level. An emergency operation centre has been established in Kwara State to strengthen coordination at operational level.
- Rapid response teams have been deployed to Kwara, Kogi and Plateau States to support local response capacity, conduct outbreak investigation and assess the risk of further amplification, among other activities.
- A reactive vaccination campaign was conducted in Kwara and Kogi States from 13 - 20 Oct 2017, targeting persons aged 12 months to 45 years. An administrative coverage of 98 percent was attained in both states. Additional vaccination campaigns in the affected areas are planned for December 2017.
- Active surveillance for acute jaundice syndrome has been intensified across the country and a national database was developed. Case investigation and contact tracing are ongoing.
- A case management centre has been designated in Kwara State, though it still requires infrastructural improvement.
- Up to 3 national laboratories with diagnostic capacity for yellow fever have been identified in-country, including the Central Public Health Laboratory in Lagos (ELISA capacity), the NCDC National Reference Laboratory in Abuja (PCR capacity) and the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH) Laboratory (PCR capacity).
- Risk communication and social mobilization activities are being implemented, including public information campaigns, radio messaging and community engagement through community leaders to dispel rumours and encourage people to be vaccinated.

SITUATION INTERPRETATION
------------------------
Enhanced surveillance for acute jaundice syndrome following confirmation of yellow fever in Kwara State has resulted in detection and confirmation of more cases. Further assessment has also revealed suboptimal routine immunisation coverage for yellow fever antigen in a number of states. While response to this event has been rapid, a comprehensive risk assessment for yellow fever transmission needs to be conducted. In the meantime, active surveillance for acute jaundice syndrome should be strengthened across the country, as well as scaling up reactive and routine yellow fever immunization activities.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall

[The cases of yellow fever (YF) occurred more widely than originally thought. Fortunately, more extensive surveillance identified other confirmed and suspected cases. Although not mentioned above, in Kwara state, the site of the index case, 200 000 people have been vaccinated. Dr Sulaiman Alege, the state's Commissioner for Health said 960 000 doses of the vaccine would be administered in 9 communities in the state. However, a proactive vaccination campaign is need over the 6 affected states, to be sure that the oubreak does not get out-of-hand quickly as it did in Angola.
