Call to DEFRA to save bees
--------------------------
A group of insect-killing agrochemicals known as neonicotinoids, that
are widely used in UK farming, have now been banned in 4 European
countries because they are thought to be killing bees. Italy has just
joined Germany, Slovenia and France in banning them.

The Soil Association has today written to Hilary Benn, DEFRA
Secretary of State, urging him to ban the products in the UK with
immediate effect. There is worldwide concern at widespread,
unexplained and devastating deaths of honey bees over the last 2
years. Bee keepers have reported potentially catastrophic loss of
bees from their hives ranging anywhere from 30-90 percent. Britain's
beekeepers have reported that close to one in 3 hives have failed to
make it through last winter. This "Colony Collapse Disorder" (CCD) is
not just a problem for beekeepers and farmers, but for consumers as
well, since bee pollination is essential for crop production.

The products implicated in bee deaths, clothianidin, imidacloprid,
fipronil and thiamethoxam, are approved to kill insects on a wide
range of crops in the UK including very widely grown oilseed rape,
barley, and sugar beet. They are also cleared for use in ornamental
plant and hop production.

Peter Melchett, Soil Association Policy Director, says, "It is
typical of the lax approach to pesticide regulation in the UK that we
look like being one of the last of the major farming countries in the
EU to wake up to the threat to our honey bees and ban these nasty
sprays. We want the Government to act today to remove this threat to
Britain's honey bees."

Since their introduction by Bayer CropScience in the USA in 2003,
these neonicotinoid products have been linked to the devastating loss
of millions of honey bees in a number of countries. Germany banned
the pesticides after beekeepers in the Baden-Wurttenberg region
reported that two thirds of their bees died in May [2008] following
the application of clothianidin (Poncho Pro). In 1995 beekeepers in
North Dakota took Bayer to court when a third of their bees were
killed by imacloprid. In France, a third of the honey bee population
was killed after widespread use of imidacloprid.

Organic farming relies on a number of techniques to avoid the use of
sprays that kill insects, including not growing the same or similar
crops every year, and encouraging natural predators of insect pests
(like wild birds, ladybirds and lacewings).

Bees disaster threatens the honey harvest
-----------------------------------------
Einstein predicted that if honey-bees were to become extinct, human
society would follow in 4 years. And lo and behold, the world's bee
population seems to be dying and no-one really knows why. Across the
globe, crops are not being pollinated and honey harvests are depleted.

In the UK, Stuart Bailey, chairman of Rowse Honey, said recently: "By
Christmas [2008] there will be no English honey in the supermarkets. I'm
absolutely sure, because we're just not getting the honey in from the
beekeepers. So we will have to import more in from abroad. That's
tragic. Imagine if that were a permanent scenario: if there are no
British honey-bees, there'll be no British honey on the shelves."

Concerned what the dying bees mean for our planet, online discussion
boards warn: "The bees are showing us something here, it is a clear warning."

Another says: "For many fruit crops, bee loss is a big, big deal.
Gardeners and those with backyard landscapes, please grow bee habitat,
and do it without pesticides, both for honeybees and for native bees."

Should we be worried? No, says Jon Davey, chairman of Reading and
District Beekeepers' Association, but the situation is serious. In
his view, the decline of the nation's -- not to mention the world's --
bee population is something Mother Nature can rectify, with a little
help from her faithful servant, the apiarist. "Bees go back to the
age of the dinosaur. We don't know why some things happen," he says.
For example, there are a lot of bumble-bees around this year. We don't
know why. "Why honeybees are disappearing, who knows? It's not good
but I should think the bees will survive providing there are
beekeepers to help them."

Problem is, wild bees producing hives of amber nectar in the woods
are long gone in the UK, rather dating AA Milne's honey-scoffing bear
Winnie the Pooh [published in the 1930s], says Davey.

Which means we are reliant on beekeepers because not only do bees
supply us with nutritious honey, they form an integral link in the
ecosystem.

Crops such as wheat are pollinated by the wind but apples, pears,
raspberries, cherries, strawberries, blackcurrants, broad and runner
beans and oilseed rape need bees for survival.

The largest threat to bees are varroa mites, a parasite introduced to
Europe and the USA when docile bees were imported from Thailand 15 years ago.

Beekeepers, along with providing secure housing, help bees deal with
the mite "with varying success," says Davey, and make sure they are
healthy. But add to this 2 dismal summers, meaning bees have not
produced enough honey to keep them going over the winter, and the
situation becomes more serious.

Berkshire beekeepers -- most of who are amateur or semi-professional
-- do their bit by attending seminars such as the disease recognition
and varroa management day held by regional bee inspector Ian Homer.
Thankfully, most members are dedicated to what is seen in this
country as a left-field hobby.

Davey is committed more than most, for it's his number that gets handed
out by Reading Borough Council when people call in to report errant
beehives in roofs and such like.

But to solve the problem of our depleted bee population, more
research is needed, says Davey. There is no doubting bee-keepers'
passion for providence (Davey started to keep bees as a solution to
runner beans which refused to germinate), but without more knowledge,
they are limited in what they can do.

There is no doubt British honey will be in short supply by Christmas
[2008], but Davey, who used to work in the trade, says it is highly
unlikely shops will have none at all, because Rowse, Hartley's and
Gale's -- the big 3 British suppliers -- import it from all over the
world, then blend and package it for supermarkets.

However, the world's big producers of honey, the USA and Argentina,
have also suffered large losses. The former dropped its yield by 36
percent on last year due to colony collapse disorder (CCD), a
mysterious disappearance linked to the blood-sucking varroa mite,
lethal viruses, malnutrition, pesticides, and a lack of genetic
diversity. And in Argentina there was a 27 percent decrease in the
harvest, boosting the price of honey by up to 60 percent.

You can expect to pay around GBP 3 [USD 5.30] for a jar of Berkshire
honey, a creeping-up in price partly the result of the bee crisis but
largely due to the European ban on the import of Chinese honey in 2002.

In the UK, a survey by the British Beekeepers' Association (BBKA)
revealed that nearly one in 3 of the 240 000 honey-bee hives did not
survive this winter and spring.

BBKA president Tim Lovett says: "Average winter bee losses due to
poor weather and disease vary from between 5 and 10 percent, so a 30
percent loss is deeply worrying. This spells serious trouble for
pollination services and honey producers."

BBKA is calling on the Government to pour GBP 8 million [USD 14 145
647] over 5 years into researching honey-bee losses and improving bee
health, small change if you consider the value of bees to pollination
-- the boost in crop production -- was GBP 165m [USD 291 753 971] in
the UK. Currently, GBP 200 000 [USD 353 641] a year is spent on
research and Defra [UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs] allocates GBP 1.3 million [USD 2 298 667] for bee health. The
only response to those calls has come from Rowse, which earlier this
month committed GBP 100 000 [USD 176 820] for honey-bee health
research over the next 3 years.
