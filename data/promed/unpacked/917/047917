Researchers have discovered new species of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the blood of 2 patients in China, according to a recent study. The study showed that the patients were carrying unidentified species of _Enterobacter huaxiensis_ and _Enterobacter chuandaensis_ that did not respond to penicillin or the cephalosporin group of antibiotics.

Enterobacteriaceae exist in the gut and are usually harmless. However, they can cause meningitis if they enter the blood or pneumonia if they get into the lungs, reported Daily Mail.

The emergence of new species of antibiotic-resistant bacteria will make deadly infections harder to cure, with delays in treatment often leading to sepsis, according to scientists from Sichuan University in China.

Importantly, genetic analysis of the microorganisms revealed they were "previously unknown," said the study published in the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology [1]. In addition, the newly discovered strains differed from other Enterobacteriaceae species by their ability to break down certain sugars and potassium salts.

The world is heading for a "post-antibiotic" era if no action is taken, the World Health Organization has warned. Pneumonia, tuberculosis, gonorrhea and salmonellosis are among the growing number of infections that are becoming harder to treat.

Abstract
---------
"_Enterobacter_ strains 090008T and 090028T were recovered from the blood of 2 different patients at West China Hospital, Chengdu, PR China in 2017. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene and multi-locus sequence analysis of the rpoB, gyrB, infB and atpD housekeeping genes revealed that the 2 strains were distinct from any previously known species of the genus _Enterobacter_. Both average nucleotide identity (ANI) and in silico DNA-DNA hybridization (isDDH) values between strains 090008T, 090028T and type strains of all known _Enterobacter_ species were lower than the cut-off (greater than or equal to 95%-96 % for ANI and greater than or equal to 70 % for isDDH) to define a bacterial species. The major cellular fatty acids of strains 090008T and 090028T are C16 : 0, C17 : 0cyclo and C18 : 1omega7c, which are similar to other _Enterobacter_ species, and the genomic DNA G+C content was 55.73 and 55.68  mol%, respectively. Strain 090008T can be differentiated from other _Enterobacter_ species by its ability to ferment sucrose, melibiose and d-arabitol, but with a negative methyl alpha-d-mannopyranoside reaction. Strain 090028T can ferment potassium gluconate, but is negative for l-fucose, mdecarboxylase, deaminase aelibiose and d-sorbitol, which distinguishes it from all other _Enterobacter_ species. Genotypic and phenotypic characteristics indicate that strains 090008T and 090028T represent 2 novel species of the genus _Enterobacter_, for which the names _Enterobacter huaxiensis_ sp. nov. and _Enterobacter chuandaensis_ sp. nov. are proposed, respectively. The type strain of _Enterobacter huaxiensis_ sp. nov. is 090008T (=GDMCC1.1426T=CCTCC AB 2018174T=CNCTC 7648T) and the type strain of _Enterobacter chuandaensis_ sp. nov. is 090028T (=GDMCC1.1427T=CCTCC AB 2018173T=CNCTC 7649T)."

_Enterobacter_ are gram-negative, facultative anaerobic bacilli in the Enterobacteriaceae family that frequently cause a wide variety of opportunistic infections in hospitalized patients, especially in ICUs. These infections have included bacteremia; intravenous catheter, urinary tract, lower respiratory tract, skin, and soft tissue infections; surgical wound and intra-abdominal infections; septic arthritis; and osteomyelitis. Outbreaks have been traced to contaminated hands of personnel; hospital equipment, such as endoscopes, stethoscopes and dialysis equipment; blood products; parenteral nutrition solutions; and albumin.

Management of infections caused by _Enterobacter_ is complicated by the organism's frequent resistance to multiple antibiotics. They often produce AmpC beta-lactamases, which are cephalosporinases that mediate resistance to cephalothin, cefazolin, cefoxitin, most penicillins, and many beta-lactamase inhibitor-beta-lactam antibiotic combinations. AmpC enzymes may be initially inducible but can be expressed constitutively at high levels following mutation, called derepression (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19136439). Derepression confers resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins including cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone, which can emerge during therapy with these drugs (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19136439). _Enterobacter_ frequently exhibit additional resistance to other classes of antibiotics.

Carbapenems have been the most reliable beta-lactam drugs for the treatment of severe _Enterobacter_ infections, but carbapenem resistance can arise by mutations that reduce influx (outer membrane porin loss) or enhance efflux (efflux pump activation), and some have acquired carbapenemases (https://mbio.asm.org/content/7/6/e02093-16). The 2 new _Enterobacter_ species, _Enterobacter huaxiensis_ and _Enterobacter chuandaensis_, are reported to be antibiotic-resistant and that the infected patients did not respond to penicillin or the cephalosporin group of antibiotics, but specific antibiotic susceptibilities are not given. - Mod.ML
