Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -- update 24 Oct 2013
----------------------------------------------------------------------
WHO has been informed of 2 laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in Saudi Arabia on [18 and 19 Oct 2013], and 3 laboratory-confirmed cases on [18 Sep 2013].

Of the 5 laboratory-confirmed cases, 2 died. The ages of the 5 patients range from 35 to 83 years old; 4 men and one woman; 2 from Medinah and 3 [from] Riyadh. 4 patients had underlying medical conditions. 2 patients reported having no contact with a laboratory-confirmed case or with animals prior to becoming ill.

Globally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 144 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 62 deaths.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -- update 29 Oct 2013
----------------------------------------------------------------------
WHO has been informed of an additional laboratory-confirmed case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in Qatar.

The patient is a 23-year-old man who was identified as a close contact of a previously laboratory-confirmed case as part of the epidemiological investigation. He is a worker in the animal barn owned by the previously laboratory-confirmed case. The man developed mild symptoms of illness and is in good condition. Preliminary investigations revealed that he did not recently travel outside the country.

Globally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 145 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 62 deaths.

Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Health care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations.

Patients diagnosed and reported to date have had respiratory disease as their primary illness. Diarrhoea is commonly reported among the patients and severe complications include renal failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with shock. It is possible that severely immunocompromised patients can present with atypical signs and symptoms.

[6] Oman: 1st case
Date: Wed 30 Oct 2013

The Sultanate of Oman yesterday [29 Oct 2013] reported the 1st case of the deadly MERS coronavirus. This was announced by Mohamed bin Saif al Hosni, Under-Secretary for Health Affairs.

Giving details of the case, he said that the situation is under control and there is no need for panic. The affected patient is undergoing treatment at a hospital and his condition is stable.

The official said the patient got the disease after contact with someone from outside the Sultanate and more details of the case will be known in few days.

Symptoms of MERS-CoV infection include renal failure and severe acute pneumonia, which often result in a fatal outcome. The 1st patient had a "7-day history of fever, cough, expectoration, and shortness of breath." MERS has an estimated incubation period of 12 days.

Like SARS [severe acute respiratory syndrome], MERS appears to cause a lung infection, with patients suffering from a temperature, cough, and breathing difficulty. But it differs in that it also causes rapid kidney failure and the extremely high death rate has caused serious concern.

To prevent the spread of disease, those with cold-like symptoms should cover their coughs and sneezes, wash hands thoroughly and frequently, and avoid sharing cups and utensils. Potentially contaminated surfaces (such as countertops and doorknobs) should be cleaned and disinfected frequently.

The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has so far claimed 62 lives worldwide, with the greatest number of deaths in Saudi Arabia where the disease first appeared in September 2012, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

[Additional information from another newswire source (Al Bawaba) stated, "The unnamed 61-year-old citizen first reported at the Adam health centre, about 200 km [124 mi] northwest of Muscat, with fever on Saturday (26 Oct 2013). He was shifted to Nizwa Hospital on Monday (28 Oct 2013) and on Tuesday (29 Oct 2013) the senior Omani citizen tested positive. According to sources the patient with MERS has not left the country in recent times and investigations are on to determine how he contracted it."

[Once again this moderator is challenged trying to reconcile the various sources of information on the numbers of cases of confirmed MERS-CoV infection in order to arrive at a correct global tally.

According to the WHO reports above (from 24 and 29 Oct 2013), if one includes the 5 new cases reported by Saudi Arabia on 18/19 Oct 2013 and 18 Sep 2013(?) plus the newly reported case from Qatar, the new global total of laboratory confirmed cases reported to WHO is 145, including 62 deaths.

In the reports from the Saudi MOH (from 27 Oct 2013), there is mention of an additional 3 newly confirmed cases including a death in a previously reported case. As the age of the fatal case is the same as the age of one of the newly reported cases, one presumes they are the same individual -- an 83-year-old female with a history of co-morbidities.

According to the newswire information in [1] and the WHO report of 29 Oct 2013, there has been a newly confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection in an individual in Qatar.

In section [6] there is a newswire report of a confirmed MERS-CoV infection in a 61-year-old individual from Oman who did not travel outside of Oman, but was known to have had contact with someone from outside of Oman with MERS-CoV. Clarification of possible exposures would be greatly appreciated, as this would suggest there was a traveller from outside of Oman who was infected with MERS-CoV.

In an earlier ProMED-mail report, there was mention of a serologic study of 50 camels in Oman where all camels studied had evidence of prior infection with MERS-CoV or a 'close relative' (see MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (68): animal reservoir, camel, research 20130907.1929762).

If one adds the 3 cases mentioned in the 27 Oct 2013 Saudi MOH report, and the newly reported case from Oman to the WHO tally, that would increase the total number of MERS cases globally to 149.

In the absence of more detailed information on confirmed cases, including ages and dates of onset of illness and specific geographic locations, reconciling the various sources of information on these cases will continue to remain a challenge.
