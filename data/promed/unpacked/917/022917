Allen County health officials are tracking a syphilis outbreak that has seen 6 pregnant women and 2 infants infected in the last 2 years.

The sexually transmitted infection, which was once the target of public health campaigns to eliminate the disease from the U.S., can cause brain damage, blindness, deafness and even death when left untreated.

The outbreak began last year [2021] as Allen County health officials identified 28 syphilis cases, including 4 pregnant women and 2 infants -- a 40% increase from 2020.

Health officials have identified another 18 syphilis cases, 2 of whom were pregnant, through June of this year [2022].

"When we started seeing these cases, it alerted us that there was going to be a problem," said Dr. Wilfred Ellis, an infectious diseases physician and president of the Allen County Board of Health.

Contact tracers have been working to identify other partners who may have been exposed. At times, Ellis said, those partners have been identified in other states or counties due in part to the prevalence of online dating apps, a new risk factor.

Many of the cases identified last year [2021] had developed late-stage neurosyphilis, while several others had developed ocular or otosyphilis -- syphilis of the eyes and ears, Ellis said.

While the infection is treatable with antibiotics, the symptoms of primary and secondary stage syphilis are often painless and go unnoticed: a sore develops near the source of the infection for 3 to 6 weeks, followed by a faint rash or sores in the mouth, private areas or on the palms and soles of a person's feet.

But left untreated, the disease may spread to the brain, nervous system, eyes and ears.

In rare cases, syphilis may progress to the tertiary or late stage in which the disease damages internal organs, possibly resulting in death.

And for pregnant women, untreated syphilis introduces the risk of passing the infection on to the child, who may in turn suffer from cataracts, seizures, hearing loss or death. In an infant, a copper-colored rash on its palm is a sign of congenital syphilis. The infection can cause bone damage, anemia, jaundice, nerve damage, meningitis, skin rashes and an enlarged liver or spleen. The CDC estimates 40% of children born to women with untreated syphilis can be stillborn or die from the infection as a newborn.

A similar trend is occurring elsewhere in Ohio and the U.S., undoing decades of disease elimination efforts.

The Ohio Department of Health sent a letter to health care providers in April [2022] urging them to screen at-risk pregnant women for syphilis in the 3rd trimester and just after delivery to prevent congenital syphilis.

Ohio law requires pregnant women to undergo syphilis screening at their 1st prenatal visit.

[The United States has experienced a rising incidence of syphilis since 2000 (https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats15/syphilis.htm). In 2000, primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis, the most contagious stages of the disease, reached historic lows with fewer than 6000 reported cases and an incidence rate of only 2.1 cases per 100 000 people. However, by 2015, 23 872 P&S syphilis cases were reported with an incidence of 7.5 cases per 100 000 population, the highest rate reported since 1994. Syphilis rates increased in every region of the United States, in every age group over 15 years, and across almost every race/ethnicity (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6089383/).

During 2000-2015, the rise in the rate of reported P&S syphilis in the United States was primarily attributable to increased cases among men and, specifically, among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM). In more recent years (2013-2015), P&S syphilis also increased among women, which was associated with increasing rates of congenital syphilis. During 2014-2015, the rate of reported P&S syphilis increased by 18.1% among men and 27.3% among women (https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats15/syphilis.htm), and in 2016, the number of congenital syphilis cases was the highest it's been since 1998 (https://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/stdfact-congenital-syphilis.htm).

A history of incarceration, illicit drug use, and homelessness have been repeatedly cited in prior ProMED posts on the rising incidence of syphilis in the USA. During 2013-2017, the proportion of primary and secondary syphilis cases that reported illicit drug use within the past 12 months more than doubled among women and men who have sex with women (MSW) (https://www.cdc.gov/std/dstdp/DCL-SyphilisRiskMMWR-feb2019.pdf).

The linkage of illicit drug use and syphilis transmission is reminiscent of the increase in syphilis among heterosexuals during the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s, when the practice of trading sex with multiple partners for drugs, especially cocaine crack, played a major role in the transmission of syphilis. Under these circumstances, the identities of sex partners are often unknown, which weakens the traditional syphilis-control strategy of partner notification.

Congenital syphilis occurs when a child is exposed in utero to a mother with untreated early syphilis. Up to 40% of babies born to women with untreated early syphilis may be stillborn, or die from the infection as a newborn (https://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/stdfact-congenital-syphilis.htm). Some babies are asymptomatic at birth, but, if untreated, may show developmental delay and damage to their bones, teeth, eyes, ears, and brain either in the 1st few weeks after birth or years later.

All pregnant women should be tested for syphilis at the 1st prenatal visit or at the time that pregnancy is confirmed. Testing should be repeated for pregnant women at high risk and in areas of high prevalence at the beginning of the 3rd trimester and at delivery.

The 2021 US CDC guidelines for syphilis screening in pregnancy can be found at https://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment-guidelines/syphilis-pregnancy.htm:

"All women should be screened serologically for syphilis at the 1st prenatal care visit (174), which is mandated by the majority of states (142 [see CDC URL immediately above for complete references]). Among populations for whom receipt of prenatal care is not optimal, serologic screening and treatment (if serologic test is reactive) should be performed at the time of pregnancy testing (632). Antepartum screening can be performed by manual nontreponemal antibody testing (e.g., RPR [the RPR, or rapid plasma reagin, test, is a blood test for syphilis that detects nontreponemal antibody] by using the traditional syphilis screening algorithm or by treponemal antibody testing (e.g., immunoassays) using the reverse sequence algorithm.

"Pregnant women with positive treponemal screening tests (e.g., EIA, CIA, or immunoblot) should have additional quantitative nontreponemal testing because titers are essential for monitoring treatment response. Serologic testing should also be performed twice during the 3rd trimester: once at 28 weeks' gestation and at delivery for pregnant women who live in communities with high rates of syphilis and for women who have been at risk for syphilis acquisition during pregnancy.

"Maternal risk factors for syphilis during pregnancy include sex with multiple partners, sex in conjunction with drug use or transactional sex, late entry to prenatal care (i.e., 1st visit during the 2nd trimester or later) or no prenatal care, methamphetamine or heroin use, incarceration of the woman or her partner, and unstable housing or homelessness (174,633-636). Moreover, as part of the management of pregnant women who have syphilis, providers should obtain information concerning ongoing risk behaviors and treatment of sex partners to assess the risk for reinfection.

"Any woman who has a fetal death after 20 weeks' gestation should be tested for syphilis. No mother or neonate should leave the hospital without maternal serologic status having been documented at least once during pregnancy. Any woman who at the time of delivery has no prenatal care history or has been at risk for syphilis acquisition during pregnancy (e.g., misuses drugs; has had another STI during pregnancy; or has had multiple sex partners, a new partner, or a partner with an STI) should have the results of a syphilis serologic test documented before discharge."

Poverty and other social factors have a big impact on rates of syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases among women. More information on factors driving this increase in syphilis in Lima, Ohio (Allen County) would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

Allen County (pop., 102 206 residents in 2020) is a county located in the northwestern part of the U.S. state of Ohio; the county seat is the city of Lima (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_County,_Ohio).
