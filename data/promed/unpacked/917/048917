Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Outbreak Reported on Afghan
Border
------------------------------------------------------------------
International medical officials are investigating an apparent outbreak of
hemorrhagic fever that has killed 3 people in a hospital just across the
Afghan border in Iran, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on
Thu 6 Jun 2002. Currently, 2 other people are being treated for what is
believed to be Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, WHO
spokeswoman Laurie Hieber-Girardt said at a U.N. briefing.
All the victims are Afghans from the Saranj district of Nimroz
province, Hieber-Girardt said. They were being treated in a hospital just
across the border in Iran and had been put in isolation to prevent
others, especially hospital workers, being exposed. "We are taking
appropriate control measures to contain the disease," she said. Results
of blood samples sent to France will be available on Fri 7 Jun 2002,
and a WHO emergency medical team was on standby to travel to the
area and set up a quarantine if the diagnosis was confirmed; something
Hieber-Girardt called "likely." "[Crimean-Congo] hemorrhagic fever
has a mortality rate of at least 30 percent, even with treatment," Hieber-
Girardt said. WHO learned of the outbreak on Tue 4 Jun 2002 from
doctors with Medecins Sans Frontieres, a nongovernmental medical
organization. "The cases occurred up to 10 days ago," Hieber-Girardt
said.
Last month, Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said that
[Crimean-Congo] hemorrhagic fever had killed 20 people since last
year and infected 30 percent of that country's cattle. The virus causing
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, which is found in Africa, Asia, and
Eastern Europe, is transmitted by ticks that thrive on sheep and cattle.
Infected people can transmit the virus by blood, saliva, or droplets
from sneezing. The disease causes a sharp drop in platelets, which
allow the blood to clot. Without rapid platelet replacements victims can
bleed to death.
