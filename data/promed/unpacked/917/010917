Health officials in Miami-Dade County, Florida, on Saturday [4 Jul 2020] confirmed that at least 18 people living in the county have contracted the West Nile virus.

The latest figures followed the county's mosquito-control chief's comments last week that this summer's [2020] resurgence of West Nile probably reflected the heavy rains that have caused mosquito populations to explode, the Miami Herald reported. More mosquitoes have meant more mosquito bites, increasing the odds of infection.

The county was under a mosquito-borne-illness alert. The health department reported West Nile virus has been the leading cause of mosquito-borne disease in the United States. Doctors have warned there were no vaccines [for humans] to prevent it or medications to treat it.

Miami-Dade's 1st 2 cases of West Nile virus in the current outbreak were detected in May [2020]. On 11 Jun [2020], health officials reported 2 more cases of the virus. On 25 Jun [2020], 10 more residents were confirmed to have the virus.

[West Nile virus transmission is active again this year (2020) in Florida. The location of human cases varies from location to location and number of human cases changes from year to year. For example, ArboNet maps (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/arbonet/Maps/ADB_Diseases_Map/index.html) show no cases so far this year (2020) in Florida; last year (2019), was relatively quiet with one case each in in Sumter and Duval counties, whereas 2018 was much more active with 46 cases scattered across the state. The current year's cases mentioned above are the 1st shown in Miami-Dade county since one case was shown in 2011. Apparently, the cases above have not yet been entered into ArboNet Maps.

WNV is maintained in a transmission cycle involving wild birds and _Culex_ mosquitoes, with spillover to humans and equine animals. Perhaps the wet conditions mentioned in the report above have provided abundant breeding sites for vector mosquitoes. Ongoing transmission of the virus will depend on abundance of vector mosquitoes juxtaposed with ample susceptible bird hosts. Nevertheless, avoidance of mosquito bites and vaccination of horses are prudent preventive measures to be adopted currently. Since WNV can infect equine animals and cause disease and death in them, vaccination should be carried our as soon as possible now that it is clear that WNV transmission is occurring. - Mod.TY
