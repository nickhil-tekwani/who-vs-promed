Bulldozers piled uprooted trees into bonfires as thick smoke rose
into the sky from thousands of burning orange and grapefruit trees.
Citrus canker (CC), the disease citrus growers fear most, has
returned to northern Manatee County, dooming about 50 000 trees to
destruction less than a year after the all-clear was given locally
for the bacteria. Experts suspect the disease was spread by hurricane
winds in 2004. Prior to the last hurricane season, 13 Florida
counties had CC outbreaks but today there are 24, said Denise Feiber,
spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Agriculture.
After struggling to eradicate CC for years, most recently in Duette
and in the downtown Bradenton areas, the state declared Manatee
County canker-free in January 2005.
The newest outbreak hit Parrish residents Byron and Betty Hodgin,
owners of New Garden Grove, particularly hard. It was our
retirement," Betty Hodgin said Monday, of the loss of 12 000 trees on
80 acres. State contractors began removal and destruction of the
trees Friday. All of the properties where CC was found are located
due north of Parrish at the Hillsborough County line, Feiber said.
The other Manatee groves include Medallion Homes Groves, Blossom
Grove and Penn Dawson.
Although not harmful to humans, CC is considered a threat to
Florida's $9-billion citrus industry. CC can cause premature leaf and
fruit drop, fruit lesions, and death of trees.
Phyllis Gilreath, Manatee County extension agent, said Monday that
the most recent figures she has show between 18 000 and 20 000 acres
of Manatee County land in citrus. "We were definitely disappointed to
find it again," Feiber said of the new canker finds, reported between
July and Wednesday.
Casey Pace, spokeswoman for Florida Citrus Mutual, the state's
largest growers' organization, acknowledged that the resurgence of CC
is a setback for growers. "I do think the consensus is we can get our
hands on it and eradicate it," Pace said. "It is disappointing
because we were so close twice to having it eradicated. In 2000, a
Broward judge put an injunction on enforcement of the program," Pace
said.
Feiber said there is a possibility of finding even more canker around
the state. "We are doing a comprehensive survey of commercial citrus
in the entire state. We have a special accelerated program being done
by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. When we have a positive find,
we survey the areas around the trees. Sometimes we go out 5 miles
from the affected area," Feiber said.
Despite the new CC finding in Manatee County, discovery of new
outbreaks around the state has been on the decline, Feiber said. She
said that about 6 percent of Florida citrus land is infected by CC,
leaving the vast majority of groves viable, Feiber said.

[CC is caused by _Xanthomonas axonopodis_ pv. _citri_ (Xac), a
bacterial plant pathogen that causes Asiatic citrus canker. Citrus
canker is an introduced plant disease, the eradication of which has
received considerable press attention and legal challenges, has
produced far-reaching political and socioeconomic impact in Florida,
and has implications for national and international trade. Infection
by Xac leads to leaf, stem, and fruit-blemishing directly, which
reduces fruit quality and quantity. The detection of Xac triggers
immediate quarantines of areas with outbreaks in Florida, disrupting
movement of fresh fruit. Eradication of CC is the only practical
option for disease management. The "1900-foot rule" was established
in January 2000 and put in practice in March 2000, requiring the
removal and destruction of diseased citrus trees and of all citrus
trees within a 1900-ft radius of a diseased tree). The 1900-ft rule
presently serves as the operational basis of the CC eradication
program. Each circle of 1900 ft radius represents 0.41 square miles
(1.06 square km). The implementation of the 1900-ft rule results in
removal of the majority of dooryard citrus within infected areas.
