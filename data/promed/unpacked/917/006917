Bangladesh says detects bird flu in poultry
-------------------------------------------
Bangladesh said on Thursday [22 Mar 2007] the H5N1 bird flu virus had
been detected in poultry near the capital Dhaka.
"Avian influenza virus has been detected in a poultry firm in Savar,
25 km from Dhaka," the information ministry said in a statement late
on Thursday [22 Mar 2007].
"A special meeting of the (government's) council of advisers was held
today [22 Mar 2007] with chief adviser of the interim government Dr.
Fakhruddin Ahmed in the chair," it said.
"The council was informed by the health, agriculture and livestock
advisers that samples from the Savar poultry tested in the Bangladesh
Livestock Research Institute and the National Institute of Animal
Health in Bangkok showed the existence of the H5N1 virus."
The virus was found in the birds from a poultry firm run by
Bangladesh's National Airlines Biman, which has already culled 30 000
birds over the last few days.
Biman officials had earlier denied the culling had any relation with
bird flu. They were not immediately available on Thursday [22 Mar
2007] night for comment.
Syed Abu Siddiq, secretary of Bangladesh Poultry Industries
Association, said there were 125 000 small and big firms in the
country, producing 250 million broilers and 6 billion eggs annually.
He said some 40 million Bangladeshis were directly or indirectly
associated with poultry farming.
Last year [2006], Bangladesh banned imports of chickens and eggs from
25 countries in Europe and Asia, including India, after H5N1 virus
had been found there.

[If officially confirmed and duly notified, Bangladesh will become
the 61st OIE-member on the list of countries infected with H5N1 since
the start of the panzootic at the end of 2003. An interactive map,
showing all ongoing and resolved H5N1 outbreaks (records also in the
Indian subcontinent) is available at

Official confirmation (or otherwise) of the 1st outbreak in this
country is anticipated soon. - Mod.AS]

Ahmedabad Zoo takes emergency steps to contain bird flu
-----------------------------------------------
Ahmedabad zoo authorities have taken precautions to avoid the spread
of bird flu, following the deaths of 4 peacocks and a goose due to
the H5N1 strain in Pakistan last month [February 2007].
"In view of the news that there are cases of bird flu in Pakistan, we
have also started taking precautionary measures. We have increased
vitamin supplements to the birds. We have taken more cleanliness
measures and have sprayed medicine inside and outside the cages. We
are routinely conducting checkups monthly more carefully and have
conducted disinfection programs. We had also sent a few cases for
investigation, but till now, there is no incident of any such case,"
said N.K. Savdhuriya, the warden of the zoo.
It was the 4th case of the H5N1 strain of bird flu detected in
Pakistan this year [2007]. The strain was 1st found in poultry last
year, and led to the culling of about 40 000 birds.
The strain reappeared in poultry last month [February 2007] in a
small farm near Islamabad. After the recurrence of the virus,
authorities had to close down the Marghazar Zoo.
There have been no cases of human infection from the virus in Pakistan.
Last year [2006], Gujarat had witnessed an outbreak of the virus
along with other western states in the country.
India had culled hundreds of thousands of birds last year [2006],
when it reported its 1st outbreak of the virus in Nandurbar. No human
infections were reported.
Several migratory birds are expected to visit the state from various
parts of the world as spring sets in, raising fears that the dreaded
virus might set foot in India also.

[On 11 Aug 2006, India officially notified the OIE that it regained
its status as notifiable avian influenza free country. (See report at:
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_05.HTM#Sec5>). The
notification included the following information: "To date,
surveillance for H5N1 (clinical, virological and serological) has
been carried out in a 15-km-radius zone around the affected areas.
Surveillance was also carried out over the rest of the country. The
results of surveillance and other relevant information on the
outbreaks are available on the Department of Animal Husbandry
Dairying and Fisheries website at
<http://www.dahd.nic.in>." According to the said final report, the
last outbreak was detected on 18 Apr 2006 in Jalgaon district,
Maharashtra State. The disease was recorded, between January and
April 2006 in 2 Indian states: Maharashtra and Gujarat.
We wish the Indian authorities success in their endeavors to prevent
the reintroduction of the disease. - Mod.AS]

Bird flu resurfaces in capital
-------------------------------
Bird flu virus has once again been detected in the federal capital,
an official confirmed here on Wednesday [21 Mar 2007]. "The National
Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza has detected bird flu virus
in 2 out of 8 crows received from different parts of the capital,"
Ministry of Food and Agriculture spokesman Dr Mohammad Afzal told Dawn.
He said these samples were received from a park, a garden and
roadside, adding that some were also brought from Tarlai.
Dr Afzal said there were chances of some other wild birds carrying
the H5N1 virus and warned that the people must not try to handle dead
birds bare handed.
He said if a dead bird was found somewhere, it should be reported to
the sanitary inspectors of the Capital Development Authority (CDA).
The whole dead bird placed in a plastic bag should be sent to the
Poultry Research Institute, Rawalpindi, or the nearest maternity hospital.
The spokesman said dead birds could be safely disposed off by deep
burial wearing disposable gloves.
He said people having backyard poultry or keeping fancy birds should
protect their birds from coming in contact with wild birds and get
them vaccinated against avian influenza.
Answering a question, Mohammad Afzal said the detection of bird flu
virus had nothing to do with chicken, and it was safe to eat.

Saudi Arabia reports 1st bird flu outbreak in fowl
-----------------------
Saudi authorities announced Thursday [22 Mar 2007] that they had
found H5N1 bird flu in captive birds, in the kingdom's 1st outbreak
of the strain of the disease that is dangerous to humans.
Laboratory tests found the strain in turkeys, parrots, peacocks and
ostriches at a farm in the Eastern Province, an agriculture ministry
statement carried by the official Saudi Press Agency said.
The ministry gave no figures for the number of cases but said that
measures had been taken to stop the disease spreading.
The neighbouring Gulf state of Kuwait has reported a spate of cases
of H5N1 bird flu in fowl since 25 Feb [2007], many of them in Wafra,
close to the border.
But of some 300 people tested for infection by the disease, not one
has so far tested positive.
