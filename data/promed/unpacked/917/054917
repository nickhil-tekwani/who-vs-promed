A rare infectious disease is confirmed in Lincoln County. So far, 2 people in the area were affected by tularemia. The latest is your typical 9 year old kid who loves the outdoors and this summer has been no exception.

"The 1st week of June 2013, he did a fishing camp at the school so he was around the lakes and river near North Platte. So every day I said 'Let's check for ticks.' I grew up camping and knew that was kind of the standard thing," said the mother who then removed 3 ticks from her son but one of the bite sites seemed to heal.

"A couple days later it started hurting on my neck," said the boy. "He was getting tireder and tireder and more and more neck pain. It got to the point where he was so stiff he wasn't even moving his neck like it was broken or something," said the father.

They went to the hospital where the boy was diagnosed with an uncommon infection called tularemia that can be transmitted through animals by ticks. "It's mostly rodents and rabbits are probably the main reservoir but other rodents can carry the bacteria," says Eduardo Freitas, MD, an infectious diseases physician.

Tick and deer fly bites are one of the most common ways the disease is transmitted [but it can also be transmitted] through skin contact with infected animals, ingestion of infected water, and inhaling infected dust contaminants. And while it is contagious between animals and humans, "it is not spread from human to human," Freitas says.

Even though there are 2 confirmed cases in the area and several statewide, physicians aren't worried yet. "They are still within the expected numbers; unless this changes over the next few weeks and then we'll be more alarmed," Freitas says. So far, 8 cases have been confirmed in Nebraska in 2013.

[This case appears to be the ulceroglandular form of the infection.

The number of reported cases of tularemia in the USA as reported by the CDC (http://www.cdc.gov/tularemia/statistics/year.html) has dropped from over 900 cases in 1950 to about 100 cases per year over the past 2 decades, although in the early 1980s there was a several-year blip of numbers around 300.

State-specific statistics from CDC (http://www.cdc.gov/tularemia/statistics/state.html) for 2001-2010 report a total of 55 cases from Nebraska for an average of 5.5 per year. The highest number in a year was 10. At this point, with 8 cases already and the tick season still on the upswing, 2013 could be a banner year for _Francisella tularensis_ in Nebraska. During the decade 2001-2010, the states with the most cases were Missouri (231), Arkansas (162), and Oklahoma (108). - Mod.LL
