Multisite Outbreak of Norovirus Infection Associated with a Franchise
Restaurant: Kent County, Michigan, May 2005
----------------------------------------------------
The majority of cases of foodborne gastroenteritis in the United
States are caused by noroviruses (1). This report summarizes an
investigation by the Kent County Health Department (KCHD) in Michigan
into 3 norovirus outbreaks and a cluster of community cases that were
associated with a national submarine sandwich franchise restaurant
during 3 to 9 May 2005. The investigation identified a potential
source, a food handler who had returned to work within a few hours of
having symptoms of gastrointestinal illness while he was still
excreting norovirus in his stools. To prevent norovirus outbreaks,
food service workers should be educated regarding norovirus
transmission and control. In 2005, new guidelines for state health
departments regarding norovirus containment were published by the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (2); guidelines for local health
departments in Michigan were issued by the state's Department of
Community Health and Department of Agriculture (3). The new
guidelines for Michigan recommend that food service workers with
suspected norovirus not return to work until they are asymptomatic
for 48 to 72 hours.
Norovirus Cases
------------
Outbreak 1. On 5 May 2005, the KCHD was notified of a gastroenteritis
outbreak among employees who had attended a school staff luncheon on
3 May 2005. Staff members were served a party-sized submarine
sandwich catered by a national franchise restaurant. A case was
defined as illness in a person who ate the suspect meal during 3 to 8
May 2005 and became ill 8 to 56 hours later with vomiting or diarrhea
and 2 of the following: fever (documented), abdominal cramps, or
nausea. A total of 23 (80 percent) of 29 school staff members
reported illness. Among the 23, predominant symptoms were diarrhea
(87 percent) and vomiting (74 percent).
Of the 6 stool specimens collected, all tested positive for norovirus
by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A retrospective cohort study was
conducted, and exposures to 26 food items were analyzed. Of 23 ill
persons, 22 reported eating lettuce; however, no specific food item
was significantly associated with illness.
Outbreak 2. On 6 May 2005, KCHD was notified of a gastroenteritis
outbreak at a publishing company staff luncheon that had occurred on
5 May 2005. Party-sized submarine sandwiches were served by the same
restaurant that catered the luncheon in outbreak 1. Among 95 persons
who could be interviewed and who ate the suspect meal, 55 (58
percent) had become ill. Predominant symptoms were diarrhea (94
percent) and vomiting (83 percent). Because the entire cohort of
exposed persons could not be interviewed, a case-control study was
conducted, and exposures to 16 food items were analyzed. Results
indicated that eating lettuce was significantly associated with
illness (odds ratio [OR] = 11.24; 95 percent confidence interval [CI]
= 1.30--95.2). Of 54 ill persons who responded to the question, 53
reported eating lettuce. Two other food items were significantly
associated with illness: jalapeno peppers (OR = 3.45; CI =
1.04-11.40) and onions (OR = 3.09; CI = 1.27-7.80). Of 52 ill persons
for whom data were available, 15 reported eating jalapenos, and 21 of
50 reported eating onions. Of 2 stool specimens that were tested
during this outbreak, one was positive by PCR for norovirus. The
owner of the restaurant was contacted, and a log of other catered
events was requested.
Outbreak 3. On 6 May 2005, KCHD learned of another outbreak through
inquiries to groups identified in the same restaurant's catered event
log. A social service organization that held a luncheon on 4 May 2005
reported that employees became sick after eating a party-sized
submarine sandwich. Of 18 persons who attended the luncheon, 9 (50
percent) became ill and met the case definition. Predominant symptoms
were vomiting and diarrhea (both 78 percent). A cohort study was
conducted, but no specific food item was significantly associated
with illness. Norovirus was detected by PCR in both of the stool
specimens tested.
Community cases. Reports from the community identified an additional
28 persons with illness onset dates of 4 to 9 May 2005, including 25
(90 percent) who reported being ill after eating sandwiches from the
same franchise restaurant that catered the events in the 3 outbreaks.
Major symptoms included diarrhea (92 percent) and vomiting (80
percent). A case-control study was conducted, but no specific food
item was associated with illness. All 3 stool specimens tested were
positive by PCR for norovirus.
Epidemiologic and Laboratory Investigation
------------------------------------------
The 3 outbreaks and community cases all appeared to have been linked
to sandwiches prepared by the same restaurant (illustrated by a
figure in the original article). Sequence analysis was performed on
21 stool specimens from the 3 outbreaks. Results demonstrated 100
percent sequence homology for the 21 specimens.
Investigators learned that a food handler employed by the restaurant
had vomiting and diarrhea on 2 May 2005. The food handler believed he
had acquired illness from his child, who had vomited on May 1. The
child's illness was traced to an ill cousin who had been exposed to
norovirus at a child care center. The food handler's vomiting ended
by the early morning of 3 May 2005, and he returned to work at the
restaurant later that morning. A stool specimen from the food handler
was collected on May 10 and tested positive by PCR for norovirus on
May 16. Sequence analysis was performed on strains from the food
handler and 8 customers who had illness consistent with the case
definition. All 9 matched the strains identified in the previous
outbreaks.
An environmental health inspection on 6 May 2005 revealed that the
restaurant had been thoroughly cleaned on 5 May in advance of a visit
by corporate supervisors on 6 May. During the inspection,
investigators learned that the food preparation sink was being used
for hand washing; a copy of the Michigan guidelines for disinfection
of norovirus (3) was provided to the restaurant owner. The restaurant
again was cleaned on 7 May 2005. On May 10, after the health
department received new complaints of illness from the public, the
health department recommended that the restaurant be closed
temporarily, and the restaurant owner complied.
On 16 May 2005, a meeting was held with members of the health
department staff and the food handler who had tested positive for
norovirus. Because of the association with eating lettuce in outbreak
2, questions were asked about lettuce-handling procedures.
Investigators learned that lettuce was sliced each morning by the
food handler who had been ill. In addition, heads of lettuce were
washed in the same sink in which employees washed their hands; the
sink was not sanitized before and after the lettuce was washed. On
May 17, a professional cleaning company was hired to clean the
restaurant, and it was reopened the next day. No further cases of
illness were reported as of May 18.

MMWR Editorial Note
-------------------
The outbreak investigation described in this report underscores the
challenges associated with preventing norovirus transmission. Small
restaurants might have difficulty operating when an employee is
absent and might not be able to afford paying leave for illness.
However, employees who become ill and continue to work can place the
public's health at risk.
The results of these investigations suggest that the illness of one
food handler might have been linked to the illnesses of at least 100
persons in multiple settings. Illnesses at a publishing company,
school, social service group, and among members of the public
resulted in closure of a warehouse, employee absences, pay for
substitute teachers, loss of wages, and loss of revenue to the
restaurant during a week-long closure.
These outbreaks demonstrate a general lack of education regarding
norovirus. Restaurant owners in Michigan are required to review the
state food code; however, no free training was offered to them to
interpret this lengthy legal document. To facilitate education,
online training programs for food handlers and managers are being
developed by Kent County public health sanitarians.
Previously, no work exclusion requirements in the Michigan food code
specifically targeted norovirus. An employee was required to report
Salmonella, Shigella, Escherichia coli O157:H7, and hepatitis A
infections or illnesses such as diarrhea, vomiting, fever, jaundice,
or sore throat with fever. Employees were required to provide written
medical documentation that they were free from the 4 specified
infectious agents via stool testing (3); no such requirement existed
for norovirus. However, the 2005 FDA Food Code included norovirus
containment recommendations for states requiring food service
employees to be excluded from work if symptomatic with vomiting or
diarrhea and, if they have been ill with suspected norovirus, not to
return to work until they have been asymptomatic for 24 hours (2). In
one study, viral shedding began approximately 15 hours after exposure
to norovirus and peaked 25--72 hours after exposure (4). However, in
this outbreak, one specimen tested positive for norovirus 14 days
after exposure. The new Michigan guidelines, issued in 2005,
recommend that employees who have been ill with suspected norovirus
not return to work for 48-72 hours after symptoms have ended.
Specific education on norovirus containment for food handlers should
be provided, even when not documented in a state food code. The
Michigan guidelines offer recommendations for cleaning and
disinfection that are based on recent studies and go beyond previous
guidelines (5), indicating the concentration of bleach required for
cleaning various porous and nonporous surfaces. The Michigan
guidelines also supply a list of other effective and ineffective
disinfectants. The restaurant described in this report was not
cleaned appropriately until after it had been closed for nearly one
week. Whether containment of norovirus resulted from the final
restaurant cleaning or whether the virus was no longer viable could
not be determined and offers an opportunity for future study.
