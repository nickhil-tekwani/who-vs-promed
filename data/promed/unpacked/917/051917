A city in China's central Hunan province reported that it had culled almost 18 000 chickens after an outbreak of H5N1 bird flu, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said in statement on its website Saturday [1 Feb 2020].

The statement didn't say when the outbreak occurred, or when the cull happened. Hunan is next to Hubei, the epicenter of the separate coronavirus outbreak.

The avian influenza, found in a farm in Shaoyang City, killed 4500 chickens, more than half the farm's flock, the ministry said. The city culled almost 18 000 poultry after the outbreak. The statement said the outbreak was of a "highly pathogenic subtype" of the H5N1 flu.

Since 2003, the H5N1 avian flu has killed 455 people worldwide, according to the World Health Organization.

[Almost all cases of H5N1 infection in people have been associated with close contact with infected live or dead birds, or H5N1-contaminated environments. The virus does not infect humans easily, and spread from person to person appears to be unusual.

Unfortunately, the newly emerged coronavirus behind the current pandemic, namely 2019nCoV, does cause person-to-person infection. Its animal reservoir animals are likely to be bats; in case an intermediate animal was/is involved in delivering a bat-borne pathogen to humans, its identity has not yet been discovered. If/when discovered, its discovery should be immediately reported to the OIE under the title "emerging disease."

HPAI H5N1, similar to other bird-borne pathogens, is seasonal. - Mod.AS
