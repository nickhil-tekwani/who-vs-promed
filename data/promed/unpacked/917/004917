Lunch turned out to be a perilous affair Thu, 26 Oct 2006, for 472
workers at a Ho Chi Minh City garment factory who suffered from food
poisoning and had to be given emergency medical treatment.
The Nobland Vietnam No 3 company workers ate fried eggs, stir-fried
cabbage, tofu, and vegetable soup supplied by an outside caterer
hired by the company. Soon after all of them were down with
headaches, dizziness, diarrhea, and vomiting.
They were taken to health centers in districts 12, Go Vap, and Hoc
Mon, and Hospital 175.
City Health Department inspectors said the company's canteens fell
short of hygiene standards and that they were conducting further
investigations.
In the first 6 months of 2006 there were 12 cases of food poisoning
affecting 786 people, 4 of them in schools, and the rest in factories.

[With a short incubation, the illness may have been caused by
pre-formed bacterial toxins such as those produced by _Staphylococcus
aureus_, _Bacillus cereus_, _Clostridium perfringens_ or other toxic
substances. These illnesses may cause vomiting, diarrhea, or both
and are usually short in duration (less than 24 hours) and not
associated with prominent fever.
Longer incubation periods (more than 24 hours) are often caused by
true infections due to bacteria (salmonella, shigella, campylobacter)
or viruses (norovirus, rotavirus), which can cause fever and often
last for several days.
