Santa Cruz County [California] is experiencing an increase in new cases of hepatitis A infection, according to county health officials. The county usually has 1-2 confirmed cased per year. In the last 7 weeks the county has received 9 confirmed cases. These newly identified cases share one or more of the following characteristics: illicit drug use (injection and non-injection), homelessness, and/or dense living conditions. Of concern is the fact that there have been recent, serious and widespread outbreaks of hepatitis A in similar identified populations in other counties (such as San Diego County).

To address this concern the county has been conducting vaccination clinics in the community and working with partners in an effort to reach those most at risk. "We are partnering with the community to ensure the people most at risk, particularly the homeless, have access to the hepatitis A vaccine," said Arnold S Leff, MD, County Public Health Officer. "We've increased our outreach to vulnerable populations and have worked to make information available. We are strongly encouraging people who are at risk to check with their health care providers and get vaccinated for hepatitis A."

To prevent the spread of hepatitis A infection: get the hepatitis A vaccination; wash your hands frequently, especially after using the bathroom or changing diapers, and before handling food; do not have sex with someone who has a hepatitis A infection; use your own towels, toothbrushes, and eating utensils; and don't share food, drinks, or smokes with other people.

[It is interesting that San Diego County and Santa Cruz County are about 400 miles (644 km) apart, with San Diego in southernmost California bordering Mexico and Santa Cruz just south of San Francisco. Clearly the underlying potential risk factors seem similar and it would be quite interesting to know if the genetic evaluation of the viruses from both counties, if available, is identical or not.

ProMED awaits more information regarding these cases as well as whether other California counties are seeing an upswing in hepatitis A cases. - Mod.LL
