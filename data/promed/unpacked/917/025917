Foot and mouth disease (FMD) in South Korea
-------------------------------------------
This report is based on information received on 24 and 29 May 2002 from Dr
Hee-Woo Lee, director, Animal Health Division, Ministry of Agriculture and
Forestry (MAF), Seoul.
All the affected farms were pig holdings, two of which included a small
number of cattle and deer, none of which presented clinical signs of FMD
and none of which was infected with the FMD virus. All the affected farms
were located within a 9 km radius of the first affected farms: in Anseong
City and Yongin City, 5 farms within the 3 km radius at-risk zone and 5
farms within the 10 km radius protection zone; in Jinchon County, 2 farms
within the 3 km radius at-risk zone. The distance between the remotest
affected farms is less than 30 km and that between the primary epicentres
is about 21 km.
The diagnosis -- of FMD virus serotype O -- was made at the National
Veterinary Research and Quarantine Service, Anyang, Kyonggi, Republic of
Korea, using clinical inspection and serological and virological tests.
The source of agent / origin of infection are under investigation, as is
the mode of spread.
Only pigs have been affected. Serological and virological tests have shown
the FMD virus to be different from the agent responsible for the 2000
outbreaks.
The chronology of the reported outbreaks is as follows: 2 outbreaks on 2
and 3 May, 4 outbreaks on 10 May, 2 outbreaks on 12 May, 1 outbreak on 18
May and 3 outbreaks on 19 May. The total number of outbreaks to date is 12.
The last cases were reported on 19 May.
Control measures during reporting period:
- movement control has been effectively maintained.
- all animals in the 12 affected farms have been destroyed: 51 233 pigs,
116 cattle, and 9 deer.
- pre-emptive slaughter has been employed to contain the spread of FMD
within the controlled areas, including all susceptible livestock within a
500 metre radius of the affected farms and all pigs within a 3 km radius of
the primary outbreak farms. As of 23 May, 29 717 animals from 45 holdings
had been destroyed within a 500 m radius of the affected farms and 30 139
animals from 39 holdings within a 3 km radius of the primary affected farms.

Don't bring back FMD from South Korea, says David Byrne
--------------------------------------------------------
Brussels: Football fans travelling to South Korea for the World Cup matches
must not bring back any food and take care if staying in the countryside.
South Korea has recently reported a number of outbreaks of foot and mouth
disease (FMD) and the South Korean Government has put all necessary
controls in place to contain the disease. Imports of animal and animal
products from South Korea are not allowed into the European Union. However,
Commissioner David Byrne, responsible for Health and Consumer Protection,
reminded football fans and national authorities to be vigilant: "We are
just recovering from a most traumatic period last year when the European
Union, especially the United Kingdom, suffered from a major FMD outbreak.
We have to do everything possible to avoid the disease being brought back
to Europe again. The damage caused by last year's outbreak was immense, not
only in financial terms but also in the loss of prized herds and the damage
to tourism in the affected areas". The commissioner added, "I cannot
overemphasise the need to observe the rules. They are simple and
straightforward. We must be sure that the World Cup in South Korea is not
remembered for the wrong reasons."
The European Commission has reminded the authorities of all member states
to make sure all travellers to South Korea are aware of the risk and to put
in place effective controls at airports for returning fans. No food,
neither a ham sandwich nor a milk shake, should be brought back or sent
back via mail. Foot and mouth disease (FMD) does not infect humans.
However, the virus does affect a range of farm animals and can be
transmitted by humans, on their clothes and shoes. The virus can also be
carried in food.
The South Korean government believes it is very that unlikely football
supporters will be exposed to the FMD virus, as the FMD infected areas are
in the countryside, far away from the World Cup stadiums and tourist areas.
