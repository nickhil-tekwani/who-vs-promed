[In Portuguese, translated & edited by Mod.JW]

As of 18 Feb 2003, 41 cases, including 15 deaths, due to yellow fever have
now been confirmed in Minas Gerais state; 24 more suspected cases and 7
deaths suspected to be YF are under investigation.
After reports of deaths in the Serro region of the state in the first week
of January 2003, a team went to the area and diagnosed sylvan yellow fever.
Serro township is outside the area designated by the Ministry of Health as
a "transition" area for YF [between the endemic area of Central Brazil and
the usually YF-free eastern regions], and vaccination coverage was
incomplete. Since then, 57 453 people have been vaccinated. A TV campaign
to encourage more people to come for vaccination was run from 16-19 Feb 2003.
