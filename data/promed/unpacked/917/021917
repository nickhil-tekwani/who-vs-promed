Nanjing quarantines nearly 100 primary schoolchildren with mumps
-----------------------------------------------------
Since more than one month ago, more than 700 pupils of Cheng-xi primary
school in the Liou-He district of Nanjing have contracted mumps. Nearly 100
pupils who suffered from the disease were forced to stay home. Up to now,
an average of 10-20 students daily have been affected and ordered not to
attend class. The Liou-He district health and education authorities are
involved in the investigation.
After 2 pm [on 12 May 2006] afternoon, a reporter visited to Cheng-xi
primary school and talked to several pupils. A girl aged 7 or 8 years told
the reporter that several children in her class had been absent with mumps:
"Many people in our class had fallen ill. Once they became ill, their faces
were swollen. So they had to stay home." The reporter [was shown] a copy of
the daily tally of mumps-infected students. On 12 May 2006, a total of 27
students in the whole school were found infected with mumps and were forced
to stay home. One day earlier, on 11 May 2006, there were 11 students in a
similar condition.
Teacher Wang explained that the mumps first appeared in a student in March
2006. The school arranged for this student to stay at home. The next day,
another student fell ill similarly, and the school made the same
arrangement. "Between that time and the May 1st Laborer's Day, few students
were ill. Shortly after Laborer's Day, the cases mounted considerably." An
insider told the reporter that from March 2006 to now, there were nearly
100 pupils who suffered from mumps in this school. From grade one to grade
6, nearly each class had sick students.
The school authority admits to having insufficient knowledge of the
outbreak. The reporter has met the school headmaster, Mr Jin-Fong Ping. Mr
Ping was quoted as saying that as soon as the school found out that there
were students who suffered from the mumps, the school ordered the ill
students to stay home and not to come to school. Besides taking the measure
of home quarantine, the school did not disinfect the classrooms or engage
in vaccine inoculation of the other students.
Mr Ping said the school had established a mumps prevention and treatment
management group, which is responsible for vaccine inoculation, medicines
delivery, and data collection, etc. "Up till now, I have not obtained any
concrete data yet, because some students went home without suffering from
the mumps, but [from] catching a cold, or having a fever etc."
At present, the Disease Prevention and Control Centers (DPCC) as well as
the Bureau of Education of Liou-He District have already gone to the school
to carry out an investigation.

Mumps is a viral infection of the salivary glands that is vaccine
preventable (90 per cent efficacy). It causes an unpleasant illness
including fever, headache, and swelling of the glands around the jaw. It is
nearly as infectious as influenza. As of mid-March this year (2006), mumps
has been exceptionally prevalent in as many as 9 states of the United
States. - Mod.RY]
