Vesicular stomatitis (VS) update
--------------------------------
On 28 May 2014, the Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) announced that the nation's 1st case of vesicular stomatitis (VS) this year involving 5 horses had been confirmed in Kinney County, Texas (southeast of Del Rio.)

Two additional cases of VS in horses in Hidalgo County in South Texas were announced last week [week of 9 Jun 2014]. One case involved 2 horses approximately 24 mi [38.6 km] northwest of Edinburg. The other case was confirmed in 1 horse 3 mi [4.8 km] northwest of Edinburg.

On 17 Jun 2014, 2 new cases of VS were confirmed in 3 horses in San Patricio County in South Texas. One case involved 2 horses located approximately 7.5 mi [12 km] southeast of Mathis. The other case is located approximately 7 mi [11.3 km] southeast of Mathis. Both VS cases tested positive for the New Jersey serotype.

The newly identified infected premises are currently under quarantine by the TAHC. Affected horses will be monitored by regulatory veterinarians while under quarantine. Premises are eligible for quarantine release 21 days after all lesions have healed.

There is no known exposure to other horses around the state, or at any equine events.
