Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Birds / 31 / 31 / 10 / 21 / 0
Affected population: backyard poultry

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*

*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments
Based on Iran's HPAI control strategy, 4 different steps of HPAI operational control program (1. report/detect; 2. confirmation; 3. extinction; 4. closure) are ongoing. The main objective of our national program is to close the HPAI outbreaks; through trace-back and trace-forward investigation, these new outbreaks were reported and closed successfully.

Control measures
Measures applied: surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; screening; quarantine; official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste; stamping out; zoning; disinfection; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Provincial Veterinary Laboratory of East Azarbayejan (local laboratory) / birds / real-time PCR / 26 Feb 2019 / positive
Central Veterinary Laboratory of Iran Veterinary Organization (CVL) (national laboratory) / birds / real-time PCR / 5 Mar 2019 / positive

[HPAI subtype H5N8 has been circulating in Iran since 2016. See reports below.

"The HPAI H5N8 outbreaks have decreased globally, and only a few countries in Africa and Middle East continue reporting outbreaks in poultry and/or wild birds. Some of these countries are located on the migratory routes for wild birds, suggesting the likely spread of the virus along the route.

"Since HPAI H5N8 subtypes cause high mortality in domestic poultry, veterinary services in at-risk countries have recommended increased prevention efforts through biosecurity to minimize contact between wild birds and poultry and enhanced surveillance and preparedness. They are also strengthening their wild bird surveillance activities in areas where viruses have been detected and in other areas where there are significant populations of migratory waterfowl.

"The majority of wild bird migration across Europe, Africa, and Asia subsides after the winter season. While wintering locations of these migratory birds are often stable, additional movement within a region may be affected by local weather conditions, food resources, access to open water, etc." http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/docs/pdf/OIE_AI_situation_report/OIE_SituationReport_AI_August2018.pdf
