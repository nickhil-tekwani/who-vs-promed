The [Taiwan] Centers for Disease Control (CDC) yesterday [14 Jul 2020] reported 4 new cases of Japanese encephalitis confirmed last week, including a 3 month old baby, the youngest case ever reported in Taiwan. CDC Epidemic Intelligence Center director Liu Ting-ping said that the cases were from New Taipei City's Sanchong District, Taoyuan City's Bade District, Taichung City's Tanzih District and Changhua County's Datsun Township.

They all lived or worked near rice paddy fields, ponds, pig pens or pigeon farms, which are ideal breeding sites for mosquitoes, she said, adding that the patient in Taichung rents a house in Nantou City near rice paddy fields and pigeon farms, so he is more likely to have contracted the disease in Nantou.

CDC physician Lin Yung-ching said that 3 of the patients are men in their 40s to 60s, and the other is a 3 month old boy in Changhua County. The infant is the youngest case of Japanese encephalitis reported since it was designated a notifiable communicable disease in 1999, he said. The previous youngest case was a 6 month old girl reported in 2007, Lin said.

The baby boy experienced a high fever, loss of appetite, and was crying and screaming, he said. He was taken to a clinic, where he was referred to a hospital for further examination, Lin said, adding that he suffered convulsions at the hospital and was later diagnosed with Japanese encephalitis.

"Japanese encephalitis vaccination is recommended for children older than 15 months, but the baby is only 3 months old and was not yet vaccinated," Lin said, adding that parents should help their young children with personal protective measures against mosquito bites when going outdoors.

Insect repellents containing the active ingredient diethyltoluamide (DEET) are recommended only for children above 2 months old, he said. Parents should choose products with DEET content of no more than 30%, Lin said, adding that insect repellents containing picaridin are recommended for children above 6 months old.

Less than 1% of infections are symptomatic, but young children and elderly people are at higher risks of suffering symptoms from infection, he said. Usually, cases that need to be hospitalized are more serious and might have a mortality rate of 20% to 30%, and lead to lifelong complications in 30% to 50% of the cases, Lin said.

[Although the above report does not give the total number of cases, the total on 7 Jul 2020 was 9, presumably bringing the national total for this year (2020) now to 13. The Japanese encephalitis (JE) transmission season in Taiwan is well under way. More cases can be expected. The mosquito species _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_ and other related _Culex_ species are efficient vectors of JE virus and breed in wet areas such as rice paddies. These culex mosquitoes are abundant enough there to accomplish transmission of the virus from birds and swine to people. Vector control is difficult. JE is a vaccine-preventable disease. It is not stated whether the affected adult individuals above had been vaccinated. The only measures to prevent infection are vaccination and avoidance of mosquito bites. - Mod.TY
