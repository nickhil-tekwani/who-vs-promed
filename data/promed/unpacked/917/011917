The Plant Clinic of Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) is
witnessing many cases of botanical [bacterial] leaf blight in paddy,
as shown by the farmers.
In a statement issued here [Ludhiana], PAU Director Extension
Education, Dr NS Malhi, said once this disease starts in paddy, there
is no way to cure it in the crop. Therefore, the farmers should
refrain from using chemicals being sold for vested interests by
unscrupulous agents.
Dr Malhi suggested some ways to mitigate the losses. He warned
against ponding of water in the fields, and application of excessive
doses of nitrogen. He said treating the seed before sowing to kill
primary inoculum and growing resistant varieties can help curb the problem.

[Bacterial leaf blight (BLB) of rice is caused by _Xanthomonas
oryzae_ pv. _oryzae_ (previously _X. campestris_ pv. _Oryza_). It was
1st noticed in Japan in 1884 and has since been reported from Asia,
northern Australia, Africa, and the USA. The pathogen causes
yellowing and drying of leaves, wilting of seedlings, and reduces
yield. In Asia, millions of hectares of rice paddies are severely
affected every year with reported yield losses of up to 60 percent.
Mild strains of the bacterium are also known, for example in the USA,
which do not cause any detectable yield loss.
Blight lesions caused by severe strains of the bacterium elongate
over the entire length of the flag leaf, giving a striped appearance
to leaves. Lesions caused by mild strains are usually only a few
centimeters long. Various saprophytic fungi may invade the lesions,
contributing to the damage. Panicles may be infected by the severe
strains. Field patches infested with bacterial blight have a whitish,
ragged appearance.
The bacterium is short-lived in soil and suspected to be seedborne,
but also to be short-lived in seeds. Grassy weeds, infected plant
material, such as rice stubble or ratoons, and contaminated
irrigation systems are thought to be the primary pathogen reservoirs.
The disease spreads by windblown rain and mechanical means (for
example when transplanting seedlings) and is favored by rain, high
levels of fertilizer, high humidity, standing pools of water, and
temperatures above 25 deg C (77 deg F).
A different pathovar (strain) of the same species, _X. oryzae_ pv.
_oryzicola_ causes bacterial leaf streak of rice. It occurs in Asia
and West Africa and yield losses of up to 30 percent have been
recorded. Symptoms vary early on, but in the later stages of the
disease look similar to BLB.
