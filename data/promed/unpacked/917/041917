Comment on influenza B virus virulence
--------------------------------------
The ProMED-mail post entitled "Influenza B, virulent - Spain (Balearic
Islands)" states the following. "These clinical presentations are not
normal and could represent the behavior of the new antigenic and genetic
variant of Influenza B virus described last year [2001] in Asia and this
year in Houston, Texas, USA (March 2002)."
This statement would only be valid if the patients in question had received
an influenza vaccine recently. Otherwise I don't think one can attribute
increased virulence to antigenic variation. Antigenic variation simply
results in escape from existing immunity, it does not necessarily lead to
unique clinical presentation. Further clarification would seem necessary.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Pekosz for his comment. The original report was
posted because it was considered important to record the occurrence of an
influenza B outbreak in an island community, which was assessed locally to
be of unusual virulence. As Dr Pekosz correctly points out, the vaccine
status of the population is relevant to interpretation of the event.
Further information from the Balearic Islands would be appreciated. - Mod.CP]
