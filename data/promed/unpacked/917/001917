Infection control officers at Gauteng hospitals have been placed on
high alert following a measles outbreak in the Tshwane [formerly
Pretoria] metropolitan area. At least 5 people have been confirmed to
have measles. Gauteng Health spokesperson JP Louw says this is an
alarming increase, since the area normally attends to one case per
year. Three of the patients are children under the age of 10.
