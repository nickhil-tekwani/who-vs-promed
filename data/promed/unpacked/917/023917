[1] Portugal: poor vaccination coverage

One in 10 children aged 13 months in Portugal had no measles vaccine at the end of last year [2019], the National Immunization Programme (NIP) reported on Fri [24 Apr 2020].

The document, which was seen by Lusa and which assesses compliance with the NIP in 2019, said that at 13 months of age, 14% of children had not yet started vaccination against measles or the invasive meningococcal disease of group C, which must be administered at 12 months.

"This puts children of this age at risk of measles outbreaks if they come into contact with cases, as they are mostly together in day-care centres, without having herd immunity, which is granted from 95% coverage," the DGS document warns.

In a statement to Lusa, the coordinator of the NIP said that although the meningococcal disease does not usually cause outbreaks, "it is a very serious disease in young children," and "the sooner they are immunised the better."

"We have herd immunity for meningococcal disease C, but at 12 months they should get vaccinated as soon as possible so they are not susceptible," she said, adding: "The same happens for measles, but for measles, it is worse because it is much more contagious and can cause outbreaks. We have measles all over Europe and in the 4 corners of the world, and that really cannot be neglected."

[2] Israel: vaccinations drop
Date: Fri 24 Apr 2020

Officials in Israel and abroad are seeing sharp declines in child vaccination rates as parents try to avoid clinics and hospitals; Israel also is seeing a spike in home births for same reason.

As parents become increasingly hesitant to go to hospitals and health clinics for fear of the coronavirus, there has been a drop in child vaccination rates and a surge in home births in the past few weeks, experts in Israel and overseas said on Fri 24 Apr 2020. And they warned that the trend could open the door for a 2nd, simultaneous virus outbreak, with particular fears regarding measles.

In Israel, the Kan public broadcaster reported there was a 30% drop in the administration of the MMRV [measles, mumps, rubella and varicella] vaccine in March 2020 and the 1st week of April 2020 compared with the same period last year [2019]. World Health Organization officials said a similar decline had been seen around the world.

The Israeli Health Ministry is urging parents to be sure to go to health clinics to vaccinate their kids, Kan reported. It said an Israeli association of pediatricians has raised concerns of a potential outbreak of measles, a highly contagious disease that in some cases can cause severe complications, including death, among the unvaccinated or the immunocompromised.

Israeli health clinics are adhering to safety and social distancing rules, and the association called on parents to stick to the normal vaccination schedule.

The problem of falling immunization rates is deepening worldwide, a top WHO official told Kan.

"This is very worrying, and it is not only Israel. We are getting reports at the WHO from across the world that immunization services are affected," Ann Lindstrand, the head of the WHO's immunization program said.

"Measles was a concern of ours already before COVID-19," she noted. "In 2019, we had more cases and more outbreaks than in a very long time."

Several countries, including Israel and the US, suffered from a severe outbreak of measles last year [2019], which resulted in fatalities.

"Our advice to all countries is to maintain these core health services for as long as possible," Lindstrand said, urging this to be done while still maintaining safe social distancing standards.

Measles is considered the most contagious of all infectious diseases. The virus causes severe flu-like symptoms and a characteristic bumpy rash, but in certain cases, complications that affect the respiratory and nervous systems can be life-threatening.

[3] Mexico: measles outbreak
Date: Fri 24 Apr 2020
Source WHO; Disease Outbreak News [abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/csr/don/24-April-2020-measles-mexico/en/


Mexico is experiencing a measles outbreak. Between 1 Jan and 2 Apr 2020, 1364 probable cases of measles were reported, of which 124 were laboratory confirmed, 991 were discarded, and 328 remain under investigation. The age of the confirmed measles cases ranged from 3 months - 68 years (median=20 years), and 59% were male. Analysis conducted by the National Reference Laboratory (InDRE) identified the genotype D8 (similar to other countries in the region), linage MVs/GirSomnath.IND/42.16/ for 17 of the confirmed cases.

Of the 124 confirmed cases, 105 were in Mexico City, 18 in Mexico State, and one in Campeche State; the following is a summary of the epidemiological situation in each:

In Mexico City, 427 probable cases were reported, of which 105 were laboratory confirmed and 83 remain under investigation. Confirmed cases have been reported in 14 town halls including Gustavo A. Madero (53 cases), Miguel Hidalgo (14 cases), Iztapalapa (9 cases), Cuajimalpa de Morelos (8 cases), Alvaro Obregon (7 cases), Xochimilco (4 cases), Cuauhtemoc (2 cases), Tlahuac (2 cases), Tlalpan (2 cases), Coyoacan (1 case), Azcapotzalco (1 case), Milpa Alta (1 case), and Venustiano Carranza (1 case). All 105 confirmed cases in Mexico City were Mexican citizens, and 60% were male. The highest proportion of confirmed cases were aged between 20-29 years (28%), followed by 2-9-year-olds (17%), 30-39-year-olds (14%), one-year-olds (11%), infants aged less than 12 months (11%), 10 to 19-year-olds (10%), and 40 years or above (9%). Of the confirmed cases, only 15 (14%) had a proven history of vaccination. Under-vaccination may be linked with missed opportunities for vaccination, a lack of access to vaccination services, scheduling limitations impacting parent's abilities to take their children to get vaccinated, or lack of vaccine stocks. The most recent confirmed case had rash onset on 2 Apr 2020 and was reported in the Gustavo A. Madero town hall.

In Mexico State, 162 probable cases were reported, of which 18 were laboratory confirmed and 65 remain under investigation. Confirmed cases were reported in 8 municipalities of Mexico State including Tlalnepantla (5 cases), Ecatepec de Morelos (4 cases), Nezahualcoyotl (2 cases), Tecamac (2 cases), Toluca (2 cases), Atizapan de Zaragoza (1 case), Chimalhuacan (1 case), Naucalpan (1 case). These 18 confirmed cases were all Mexican citizens, and 56% were male. The highest proportion of confirmed cases was reported among 20-29-year-olds (22%), followed by one-year-olds (17%), 2-9-year-olds (17%), 30-39-year-olds (17%), infants aged less than 12 months (11%), 10-19-year-olds (11%) and 40-year-olds or above (5%). Of the confirmed cases, 3 cases (33%) had proven history of vaccination. The most recent confirmed case in the State of Mexico had rash onset on 27 Mar 2020 and lives in the Tlalnepantla de Baz municipality.

In Campeche State, 8 probable cases were reported, of which one was confirmed, and 7 remain under investigation. The confirmed case is a 5-year-old female resident of Champoton Municipality who had rash onset on 21 Mar 2020. The case has a proven history of vaccination with no history of travel outside of the state. The probable place of exposure was Merida City, Yucatan State.

The rash onset dates of the confirmed cases in Mexico were between 12 Feb and 2 Apr 2020. Figure 1 shows the progression of the outbreak. An exponential increase of confirmed cases could be observed in the coming weeks.

The WHO Region of the Americas was declared free of measles in September 2016. However, Venezuela and Brazil lost their measles-free status on 1 Jul 2018 and 19 Feb 2019, respectively due to major measles outbreaks between 2018 and 2019. Of 35 Member States, 33 have maintained the measles-free status. In 2019, 14 countries in the Region of the Americas reported confirmed cases of measles, including Brazil (19 326 cases, including 15 deaths), the United States of America (1282 cases), Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (548 cases, including 3 deaths), Colombia (242 cases, including one death), Canada (113 cases), Argentina (107 cases), Mexico (20 cases), Chile (11 cases), Costa Rica (10 cases), Uruguay (9 cases), Bahamas (3 cases), Peru (2 cases), Cuba (1 case), and St. Lucia (one case). Between 1 Jan and 4 Apr 2020, 7 countries have reported confirmed measles cases, including Brazil (2194 cases, 4 deaths), Mexico (124 cases), Argentina (54 cases, one death), the United States of America (12 cases), Uruguay (2 cases), Chile (2 cases), and Canada (one case).

[4] Bolivia: atypical case
Date: Sat 25 Apr 2020
Source: Outbreak News Today [edited]
http://outbreaknewstoday.com/bolivia-measles-case-reported-after-19-years-in-santa-cruz-76112/


In Bolivia, director of Epidemiology Virgilio Prieto reported Thursday [23 Apr 2020] that an atypical case of measles was reported in the city of Santa Cruz.

The patient is a 29-year-old pediatrician with no travel history, no contact with tourists, and she was vaccinated as a child.

"We say it is an atypical case because despite being vaccinated, she presented signs and symptoms of the disease: fever, cough, runny nose, and skin spots," the authority explained in a statement.

The patient underwent tests and in all of them came out positive; it is suspected that the contagion may have originated in an unvaccinated minor, taking into account the care provided by the health professional.

"For about 20 years, measles was eradicated, [and now] the virus is spreading again in the region."

Before the outbreak of the disease, the Ministry of Health activated control measures, such as isolation of patients and investigation of contacts. Vaccination is also being carried out in the patients' close environments; likewise, the appearance of suspicious cases is being followed up, and active searches for other cases are being carried out.

[Between 1 Jan and 10 Apr 2020, 7 countries reported 1104 confirmed cases in the Region of the Americas: Argentina (54 cases, including one death), Brazil (909 cases, including 4 deaths), Canada (one case), Chile (2 cases), Mexico (124 cases), the United States of America (12 cases), and Uruguay (2 cases); (http://outbreaknewstoday.com/measles-in-the-americas-1100-confirmed-cases-to-date-buenos-aires-mexico-city-and-sao-paulo-41981/).

Published medical research indicates that vaccine failure due to waning immunity can occur, despite multiple doses of measles vaccine. Measles vaccine-acquired immunity is reported to wane in at least 5 percent of cases within 10 to 15 years after vaccination. Moreover, exposure to natural measles may be necessary for the maintenance of protective antibodies in vaccinated persons. The Vaccine Research Group at Minnesota's Mayo Clinic reports that up to 10 percent of persons who receive 2 doses of MMR vaccine "fail to develop protective humoral immunity, and those antibody levels wane over time, which can result in infection."

[5] Malaysia: drop in measles cases
Date: Sat 25 Apr 2020

There has been a decline in the number of measles cases in Malaysia from 1958 in 2018 to 1077 last year [2019].

"However, measles deaths rose from 6 in 2018 to 15 last year [2019]," said Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah in a statement yesterday [24 Apr 2020] to mark World Immunisation Week (24 Apr-30 Apr 2020).

Dr Noor Hisham said pertussis (whooping cough) cases also increased from 892 in 2018 to 915 last year [2019], while deaths declined from 22 to 20 for the same period.

As for diphtheria cases, they declined slightly, from 18 in 2018 to 16 last year [2019], with 6 deaths for each respective year.

"The majority of these cases did not receive vaccination. There were also cases among infants, who were not old enough to be vaccinated," he said.

For WHO and UNICEF, measles continues to remain an ever-present threat, especially if vaccination rates drop, with projections indicating that as many as 800 000 people may have been infected with measles last year [2019].

"This year [2020], there are increasing concerns about another resurgence, especially if vaccination rates fall due to delay or suspension of scheduled immunisation activities as a result of Covid-19," said WHO and UNICEF, adding that the Covid-19 pandemic was a good illustration of how fast an outbreak could spread when communities do not have immunisation.

"While no vaccine exists yet for Covid-19, the world has effective and safe vaccines for other serious and highly contagious diseases like measles, polio or diphtheria. In taking appropriate measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19, we must make efforts to ensure that children are up-to-date with their vaccination schedule," they said in a joint statement yesterday [24 Apr 2020].

"Globally, the Covid-19 pandemic is overstretching health systems. Health workers are being diverted to support the outbreak response, putting them at risk of illness and death. The longer the pandemic continues, the more essential health services, including vaccination services, are disrupted," they said.

World Immunisation Week aims to promote the use of vaccines to protect people of all ages against diseases.

With this year's [2020] theme being #VaccinesWork for All, the campaign will focus on how vaccines -- along with the people who develop and deliver them -- are heroes in protecting public health.

They pointed out that Sabah is now in urgent need to resume its polio vaccination programme that has been interrupted by the movement control order.

In February 2020, the Health Ministry received 2.5 million doses of polio vaccine that will be delivered to over one million children below 13 years old in the state as part of the polio immunisation campaign following an outbreak of the disease.

"It is crucial that efforts are made to resume and strengthen immunisation activities as soon as physical distancing measures are lifted. There are many impacts of Covid-19, including the possible resurgence of diseases that can be prevented with safe and effective vaccines," said Dr Lo Ying-Ru, WHO representative for Malaysia, Brunei and Singapore.

WHO maintains that it is essential to ensure access to immunisation services during Covid-19, and that parents should continue to bring their children to be vaccinated against vaccine-preventable diseases.

"WHO urges countries to prioritise the continuation of routine immunisation of children in essential service delivery, as well as vaccinations for groups most at risk. If immunisation services must be suspended, urgent catch-up vaccinations should be rescheduled as soon as possible, prioritising those most at risk," they said.

Both organisations also said that the impact from Covid-19 has been a painful lesson for the failure to make vaccines universally available.

"The poorest and most marginalised children, who need immunisation the most, continue to be the least likely to get it. Most of the unvaccinated children live in remote rural locations or with undocumented, refugee, migrant or stateless families. Disease does not discriminate, and neither should interventions. Every child, no matter their status, has the right to be immunised," said Marianne Clark-Hattingh, UNICEF representative to Malaysia.

[6] Global group warning
Date: Fri 24 Apr 2020

Global Group Warns COVID-19 May Hinder Measles Vaccination; New AAFP Resources Guide FPs on Immunizations
--------------------------------
Story Highlights
- A statement from the Measles & Rubella Initiative indicates that the COVID-19 pandemic could cause dozens of measles immunization campaigns worldwide to be postponed or suspended.
- The initiative estimates that more than 117 million children could be at risk of missing their measles vaccinations as a result.
- To address member concerns, the AAFP has developed resources on office preparedness and preventive and nonurgent care, including immunizations.

As the numbers of COVID-19 cases and fatalities continue to climb, some health organizations have already started thinking about the pandemic's effects on efforts to curb the spread of other infectious diseases.

Take, for example, the Measles & Rubella Initiative, a global partnership founded by the CDC, the World Health Organization and other groups that is committed to stopping the spread of measles and rubella outbreaks. On 14 Apr 2020, the initiative released a statement (http://measlesrubellainitiative.org) that indicated the COVID-19 pandemic could result in the suspension or postponement of dozens of measles immunization campaigns worldwide, potentially leaving more than 117 million children around the globe at risk of missing important measles vaccinations.

"The pandemic sweeping the globe requires a coordinated effort and commitment of resources to ensure front-line health workers around the world are protected as they face and respond to this new threat," the initiative said in its statement. "At the same time, we must also champion efforts to protect essential immunization services, now and for the future."

In its statement, the initiative pointed to interim guidance (apps.who.int) the WHO issued in March 2020 that states immunization is a core health service that should be prioritized to prevent communicable diseases and that immunization services should continue to be provided wherever they can be performed safely.

In areas with a high risk of COVID-19 transmission, the guidance recommends that governments weigh the risks and benefits of delaying routine mass immunization campaigns and consider postponing those campaigns if necessary. The guidance also recommends that governments temporarily pause preventive immunization campaigns in the absence of a vaccine-preventable disease outbreak. If campaigns are disrupted, countries should design strategies to track unvaccinated children, assess immunity gaps, and develop plans to swiftly deliver catch-up vaccinations after physical distancing measures are lifted.

"If the difficult choice to pause vaccination is made due to the spread of COVID-19, we urge leaders to intensify efforts to track unvaccinated children so that the most vulnerable populations can be provided with measles vaccines as soon as it becomes possible to do so," said the release. "While we know there will be many demands on health systems and frontline workers during and beyond the threat of COVID-19, delivering all immunization services, including measles vaccines, is essential to saving lives that would otherwise be lost to vaccine-preventable diseases."

Although immunization programs in the United States don't appear to have been adversely affected at this time, it's important to remember that last year [2019], 1282 individual cases of measles were reported in 31 states, the highest number since 1992 (http://www.cdc.gov). As a result of prolonged measles outbreaks across multiple states in 2019, the United States nearly lost its measles elimination status, which it has held since 2000.

[COVID-19 clearly has created a difficult situation with physical distancing complicating standard immunization programs, such as those for diphtheria, polio and measles. The repercussions from this unfortunate consequence of the pandemic are likely to be huge. There has been a global increase in measles with a drop in vaccination coverage preceding COVID-19. According to UNICEF, even before the COVID-19 pandemic, measles, polio, and other vaccines were out of reach for 20 million children below the age of one every year. Over 13 million children below the age of one globally did not receive any vaccines at all in 2018, many of whom live in countries with weak health systems. Given the current disruptions, this could create pathways to disastrous outbreaks in 2020 and well beyond. At last count, most countries had suspended mass polio campaigns, and 25 countries had postponed mass measles campaigns, as per recommended guidance during the pandemic (https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/over-13-million-children-did-not-receive-any-vaccines-all-even-covid-19-disrupted).

This is a situation that must be watched carefully. - Mod.LK]
