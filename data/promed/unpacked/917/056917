Cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy (CRGV), commonly referred to as Alabama rot, has been confirmed in 112 dogs across 31 counties [in the United Kingdom] (with a mortality rate of 80 per cent) since it was 1st detected in 2012. Its cause is unknown.

Fish vet Fiona Macdonald is researching whether _Aeromonas hydrophila_, a heterotrophic, Gram negative, rod-shaped bacterium, present in water sources and soil, might be involved in the aetiology of CRGV.

In a document sent to Veterinary Times entitled "CRGV (Alabama rot) - an organism of interest?," Dr Macdonald explained: "There is a suspicion initial cases of CRGV occurred in areas with substantial amounts of water as a result of unusually high rainfall; both running and standing water was close to 4 C [39 F] for some weeks around the time of the cases.

"To date, dogs appear to be the only species affected, with no reported cases in wild ponies, foxes, cattle or deer. There have been recorded cases of infection with _A. hydrophila_ in dogs, which mirrored leptospira infections, and this pathogen has been on the list of possible causes of CRGV since early manifestations of the problem."

Dr Macdonald is receiving funding for her work from the New Forest Dog Owners Group, and is appealing for help from UK vets. She said: "I want blood samples from suspected CRGV cases, and I'm happy to send out swabs along with a sampling protocol to any vet for them to swab any suspicious lesions. Email me at <fiona@fish-treatment.co.uk>."

David Walker, from Anderson Moores Veterinary Specialists, and the UK's leading authority on CRGV, said: "It's a nice piece of work. ... I'm hoping she publishes, because it's a possible stepping stone for either her or others to take on the work and truly include or exclude this organism in the Alabama rot investigation."

[A one-day conference addressing CRGV was held on 10 May 2017 in Reading, Berkshire. Participants exchanged their experience and observations, but the etiology of the syndrome remained enigmatic. Following the conference, David Walker, an authority on the issue, said: "We've already started the process of setting up a steering committee to help focus the enormous experience and knowledge from the 30 specialists who gave up their time for free to attend. Among the items we discussed was the sharing of data from similar human health issues to identify any possible connections.

"The way dogs contract the disease is still unknown. It invariably begins after a dog has been out walking, and the 1st signs are lesions developing on the lower legs. As the illness takes hold, dogs decline quickly as they succumb to kidney failure. From the 1st sores to death can be as quick as 7 days.

"Research is vital if we are to understand more about this condition, find a cause, and be able to prevent or treat it, and funding is essential to achieve these goals."

The full paper of Fiona Macdonald is expected to appear in the 8 Jan 2018 issue of Veterinary Times (https://www.vettimes.co.uk). - Mod.AS
