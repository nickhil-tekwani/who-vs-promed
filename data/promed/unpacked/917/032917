CHP [Center for Health Protection] advises a kindergarten to suspend classes
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health
today [12 Nov 2008] advised a kindergarten with an outbreak of upper
respiratory tract infection to suspend classes for one week to
enhance infection control measures.

The school concerned is St Margaret Mary's Catholic Kindergarten in
Wan Chai. A total of 34 children aged from 4 to 5 developed symptoms
of upper respiratory tract infection, including fever, sore throat
and cough, between 3 Nov and 11 Nov 2008. Of these, 5 were
hospitalised for further management. They are in stable condition and
one of them has been discharged. Laboratory tests on nasal pharyngeal
aspirates samples of 2 hospitalised children showed positive results
to adenovirus.

A CHP spokesman said that the kindergarten was advised to suspend
classes for a week until 19 Nov 2008 for thorough disinfection in
order to prevent further spread of the diseases in the school. He
said, "The school management had stepped up cleansing and infection
control measures according to CHP's advice following the Centre's
visit. CHP will closely monitor the situation. Parents are advised to
pay attention to the health condition of their children, and to
remind them to observe good personal and environmental hygiene."

The CHP spokesman said, "Adenovirus is a group of viruses that
commonly cause viral infection in children. The symptoms may vary
from respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat to
gastroenteritis illnesses such as vomiting and diarrhoea. There may
be associated conjunctivitis. "Adenovirus infection is usually
transmitted by direct contact or fecal-oral transmission. It can
occur throughout the year," he said.

The spokesman said while most infections were mild and required no
therapy or only symptomatic treatment, strict attention to good
hygiene practices was effective for preventing adenovirus-associated disease.
