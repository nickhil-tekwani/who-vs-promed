From: "Dr. Herbert Schmitz" <Schmitz@bni.uni-hamburg.de>

Referring to the West Nile-like cases in the US and in Nepal, I would like
to offer our mu-capture ELISA for West Nile IgM antibodies. We have been
using this ELISA for West Nile IgM antibody detection for 15 years. The
test protocol uses West Nile virus (Uganda strain) and biotinylated West
Nile monoclonals. We have produced 30 West Nile monoclonals in 1986 and
clone 15R4 is West Nile type-specific.
If anyone is interested in testing serum samples for West Nile IgG or IgM
antibodies we would be ready to do this.
