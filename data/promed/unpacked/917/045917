The World Bank pledged USD 50 million to the battle against cholera in Haiti Thursday, 9 Oct 2014. World Bank officials hope to further the Haitian initiative to maintain clean water, improve sanitation and better health. The bank announced the donation at a conference and called for other donors, according to Outbreak News. With the donations, Haitian people will potentially gain access to safe water, which will slow the growth of waterborne diseases, like cholera.

"We have made significant progress in controlling the cholera epidemic in Haiti, but too many people are still getting sick, mainly because they don't have access to clean water and lack sanitation systems. Cholera remains endemic and water-borne diseases are one of the leading causes of infant mortality in Haiti," said Jim Yong Kim, World Bank Group President. "Expanding coverage of safe water and sanitation is possible. We cannot ignore this opportunity to prevent thousands more Haitian children from dying from waterborne diseases," added Kim.

"I fear that the enormous progress we have made leads people to believe that the problem has been resolved. It is not resolved," Pedro Medrano, the UN coordinator overseeing cholera response in Haiti, told AFP.

Since the beginning of the cholera epidemic, which began in October 2010, 8562 people have died. There have been 703 510 reported cases and 393 912 of those with the disease were hospitalized.

While the number of cholera deaths has decreased since the outbreak began 4 years ago, Haiti is still averaging 291 cases and 1 death each week in 2014.

[2] Cholera - Nigeria (Adamawa State)

An outbreak of cholera has claimed the lives of over 20 persons in Murke community of Song local government area of Adamawa State.

The outbreak of the disease, which public officials said has the same symptoms as cholera, is threatening to wipe out the whole community as almost one individual in every household had been hit by the disease. Health workers mobilised to the community as part of an emergency response by the government to contain the cholera outbreak in the area have linked the incidence to lack of clean drinking water in the community.

Ms. Jummai Murke, a public health official in the area who spoke on the outbreak, said the incidence, which has become a perennial occurrence in the community as a result of the challenge faced by the people on access to potable water, had often resulted in the loss of lives.

She said the outbreak this year [2014] of a cholera-like symptom disease was severe, adding that virtually every household in the community had somebody who is plagued by the ailment.

According to her, already over 20 persons had died since the outbreak over the weekend. The district head of Murke, Yayaha Dahiru, has called on the state government to come to the aid of the community. He said the people of his district faced the threat of being wiped out by the recurring outbreak of cholera. According to him, the only source of drinking water in the community is water from a contaminated stream, which is responsible for their plight.

National Mirror learnt as at the time of filling this report that the primary health clinic in Murke had been completely overstretched by new cases. As a result, public health officials were being forced to attend to patients outside the facility, as many patients could be seen lying outside the health facility with drips on them.

[4] Cholera - Ghana

The festering cholera epidemic has now affected more than 22 000 people in all the 10 regions of Ghana. At least 170 of those affected have died in different parts of the country.

Public health officials at the Ghana Health Service have described the epidemic as the worst ever in more than 3 decades. It is feared the numbers could soar further.

The diarrheal disease has taken a toll on residents in the national capital, Accra, especially, due to bad sanitation practices in coastal towns and slums.
