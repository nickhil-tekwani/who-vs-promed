Missouri, South Carolina plant scientists find soybean rust
-----------------------------------------------
Suspected soybean leaf samples collected in Missouri and South Carolina
last week [final week of November 2004] have tested positive for
_Phakopsora pachyrhizi_, or soybean rust [SR], at USDA's National Plant
Germplasm and Biotechnology Laboratory in Beltsville, Maryland today [30
Nov 2004].
University of Missouri extension specialists collected suspicious soybean
leaf samples from soybean fields in Pemiscot and New Madrid counties in
Southeast Missouri on 24 Nov 2004. Those samples were sent to the NPGBL,
where diagnosticians confirmed the presence of SR.
Meanwhile, a Clemson University plant pathologist submitted suspected
soybean leaf samples from 4 counties in South Carolina the same day.
Samples from Allendale and Pickens counties tested positive for SR.
SR, a disease spread primarily by wind-borne spores, was first discovered
in the United States on 10 Nov 2004 in Louisiana. It is now in 8 states:
Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, and
South Carolina.
USDA encourages growers to contact USDA's Extension Service, their State
Department of Agriculture, and crop consultants to obtain information on
which fungicides are registered for use in their states, as well as when
these fungicides should be used.
