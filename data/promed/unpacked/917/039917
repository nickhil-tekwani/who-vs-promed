Algae is toxic to sea life
------------------
A bloom of toxic phytoplankton off Southern California threatens sea lions
and other marine life that feed on sardines, anchovies and other small
fish, authorities warn.
"We could have a big die-off," says Dennis Kelly, chairman of the Marine
Science Department at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa.
Dozens of pregnant sea lions suffering from domoic acid poisoning beached
themselves in Southern California last week. A microscopic algae produces
the toxin that causes brain damage in marine mammals, but does not appear
to affect fish.
Joe Cordaro, a wildlife biologist with the National Marine Fisheries
Service, says it's too early to tell if a major die-off is imminent. He
says water samples taken near Santa Catalina Island contain the algae that
produces the acid, but added "it's not a widespread bloom right now."
Toxic phytoplankton outbreaks off the coast killed 1500 sea lions and
dolphins in 2002 and 2003.

[This article indicates that all the conditions are correct for the algal
bloom to produce the toxin and cause a large die-off, but it does not say
that a die-off is occurring.
Domoic acid, an acidic cyanotoxin, associated with certain algal blooms and
possibly produced by the diatom Pseudo-nitzschia is also called Amnesic
Shellfish Poison (ASP). Domoic acid was named for the seaweed from which it
was discovered, _Chondria armata_, called domoi in Japan. The toxic acid is
accumulated by marine organisms (including sea lions) feeding on
phytoplakton, anchovies, sardines, and shellfish. Domoic acid is
essentially a neurotoxin in mammals causing brain damage, neurological
dysfunction, and death in severe cases. - Mod.TG]
