Testing at the National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease in Winnipeg
has confirmed bovine spongiform encephalopathy in a cow from British
Columbia. No part of this animal entered the human food or animal
feed systems.
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) is also conducting a
thorough examination of potential sources of infection. Investigators
will pay particular attention to the feed to which the animal may
have been exposed early in its life, when cattle are most susceptible
to BSE.

Final testing confirms BSE case in B.C.
---------------------------------------------
Testing at the National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease in Winnipeg
has confirmed bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in a cow from
British Columbia. As reported on 13 Apr 2006, samples from this
animal were sent to Winnipeg for additional testing after screening
tests produced inconclusive results.
This finding does not affect the safety of Canadian beef. Tissues in
which BSE is known to concentrate in infected animals are removed
from all cattle slaughtered in Canada for domestic and international
human consumption. No part of this animal entered the human food or
animal feed systems.
Preliminary investigations conducted prior to receiving final results
identified the animal's exact date of birth and birth farm, 2
critical elements required to trace other animals of interest, as
defined by the World Organization for Animal Health. With the
confirmed positive results and this information already in hand, the
Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has immediately undertaken the
animal component of its investigation on a priority basis.
The CFIA is also conducting a thorough examination of potential
sources of infection. Investigators will pay particular attention to
the feed to which the animal may have been exposed early in its life,
when cattle are most susceptible to BSE. The CFIA is collecting
records of feed purchased by and used on the animal's birth farm. As
in previous investigations, the CFIA will also fully consider all
other scientific pathways in an attempt to definitively determine how
the animal became infected.
This animal, a 6-year-old dairy cow, developed BSE after the
implementation of Canada's feed ban. Similar situations are common to
almost all BSE-affected countries that have introduced feed controls.
Although the design, implementation and compliance of Canada's feed
ban have been rigorously assessed by a number of countries over the
past several years, and have been described as robust and effectively
enforced, the government is committed to continuously making
improvements where possible. An enhanced feed ban would accelerate
the eradication of BSE in Canada. Accordingly, the CFIA has published
proposed regulatory amendments, and, following extensive
consultations, is now in the process of finalizing their content.
The feed ban and national surveillance program which identified this
animal contribute to Canada's interlocking BSE controls. While the
feed ban continues to limit the spread of BSE, Canada's national
surveillance program effectively monitors the health of the Canadian
cattle herd. The national surveillance program, which targets cattle
most at risk of having BSE, has tested more than 100 000 such animals
since 2003. The detection of only 5 animals within this high-risk
population over the past 3 years and the age of the animals detected
supports the conclusion that the level of BSE in Canada is very low
and declining.
The strong participation of producers to facilitate the detection of
any suspect cases at the farm level, as demonstrated once again by
this most recent finding, and the close collaboration between the
Provinces and Federal Government in the surveillance effort
demonstrates the shared commitment which exists to protect animal and
human health in Canada.
In keeping with its ongoing practice, the CFIA will post to its
website updated information as it becomes available.

[This animal appears to be one that was "born after the ban," or BAB,
which may indicate that there is or was some food contamination at
some point, or perhaps this may be an isolated spontaneous event. As
the investigation proceeds, we will look forward to CFIA informing us
on this matter. - Mod.TG]
