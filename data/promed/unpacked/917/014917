Fishermen yesterday said the authorities had acted irresponsibly when they
told people to refrain from eating large coral reef fish. Instead, the
Government should have traced the origin of the contaminated fish, which
have poisoned scores of people in the past few weeks. The fishermen said
they feared becoming victims following the chicken hawkers and farmers.
The Joint Committee of Hong Kong Fishermen's Organisations, which
represents 44 groups, will today demand clarification from the Government.
Some fishermen complained of a drop of business immediately following the
Government's revelation on Saturday of 50 suspected ciguatera-poisoning
cases. Twenty-one more patients were admitted to Tuen Mun Hospital on
Sunday after eating tiger garoupa at a dai pai dong restaurant. One of the
patients was the son of the restaurant owner. "We didn't know the fish was
contaminated. Even my son ate the fish and felt ill. He was admitted to
hospital, too," said the restaurant owner.
Last night, two men and two women, aged 42 to 52, remained in hospital.
Their condition was stable. The Health Department has warned people to
avoid coral reef fish weighing more than three catties [1 catty = 500 g.
But Fishermen's Association chairman Lai Kwok-kui claimed the advice was
stupid. "Shall we dump all the big fish following the mass slaughter of
chickens? The officials should trace the source of the fish and find out
why they are contaminated instead of asking people not to eat big fish," he
said. An Agriculture and Fisheries Department spokesman said its officials
had met Health Department colleagues to get more information about the
toxic fish. The Democratic Party backed the call for the source of the
poisoned fish to be traced.
CDPC Note: This syndrome is caused by the presence in the fish of toxins
elaborated by the dinoflagellate _Gambierdiscus toxicus_ and certain other
algae that grow in coral reefs. Fish eating the algae become toxic, and the
effect is magnified up the food chain so that predatory fish become the
most toxic.
Ciguatera poisoning is a significant cause of disease in areas where
consumption of reef fish is common (the Caribbean, southern Florida,
Hawaii, the South Pacific, and Australia). The consumption of large
predatory fish should be avoided, especially in the reef area. In areas
where assays for toxic fish are available, such as Hawaii, the risk of
toxicity can be reduced by screening all large "high-risk" fish. The
occurrence of toxic fish is sporadic and not all fish of a given species or
from a given area will be toxic. Reef fish eaters beware!

[The fishermen have a point as not all reef fish present a risk. The
dinoflagellate is associated with reef damage; for example in the Caribbean
it can follow hurricanes. Fishing with dynamite does not help either. One
of the problems in the Caribbean, and possibly Hong Kong, is that young men
have not followed their fathers into being professional fisherman, and
thereby learn where and where not to fish, but will indulge in it for
sudden extra cash, and then fish in places their fathers know/knew to be
dangerous. - Mod.MHJ
