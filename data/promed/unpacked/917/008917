Japanese consumers are growing wary of food safety after Mikasa Foods
admitted it sold tons of contaminated rice.
---------------------
After an Osaka-based company was found early this month [September
2008] to have sold tons of tainted rice illegally for human
consumption, Noriko Takada thought "Not again!" A series of food
scandals, such as the fraudulent labeling of meat and sale of food
after its use-by date, have convinced the 48-year-old Tokyo housewife
that "people in the food industry care little about consumers' safety
and more about making profits. I love senbei [rice crackers] so much
that it's possible I have eaten some made from tainted rice."

Even as China's tainted-milk scandal (BusinessWeek.com, 22 Sep 2008)
continues to spread, Japanese consumers like Takada worried about a
food scare closer to home. Early this month [September 2008], Mikasa
Foods, a rice wholesaler in Osaka, admitted that it purchased a batch
of contaminated rice from the government meant to be sold only as an
inedible product for industry use. Mikasa then sold it to hundreds of
companies across Japan to boost profits. The rice went into sake,
shochu (distilled spirit), and rice crackers. Contaminated rice also
went to more than 100 hospitals, homes for the elderly, and at least
46 schools.

Behind the current scare is polished white rice that has been found
to contain pesticides or mold. The Japanese media are calling it
jiko-mai, or problematic rice. The jiko-mai is imported and is the
result of a deal Tokyo made with the World Trade Organization in 1995
to open its long-protected market to foreign-grown rice. Thanks to
that agreement, Japan imports 770 000 tons of rice every year
(BusinessWeek.com, 22 May 2008) from the U.S., Thailand, Viet Nam,
China, and Australia. Because the Japanese appetite for rice has
shrunk, much of that rice is kept in storage, where some gets moldy
or rots. In 2006, the government found that 2795 tons of rice in
storage was contaminated with excess levels of the pesticide
methamidophos, and a large volume of it was sold for industrial use.
In the past 5 years, about 7400 tons of stockpiled rice unfit for
human consumption has been sold for industrial use.

Mikasa Foods has purchased jiko-mai more than 50 times directly from
the government since 2003, amounting to some 1779 tons in total,
according to the Agriculture, Forestry & Fisheries Ministry. In
addition to the troubled rice it bought from the government, the
company has bought 217 tons of moldy rice from Sumitomo.

On 6 Sep 2008, Mikasa President Mitsuo Fuyuki admitted he gave
instructions to resell the rice illegally and to keep 2 sets of
books. "We knew we shouldn't have done it, but we did because of the
tough management," said Fuyuki at a press conference in Osaka. He has
hidden himself from public view since then.

As the scandal develops, other firms are being implicated. By 16 Sep
2008, 3 more food companies -- Asai, Ota Sangyo, and Shimada Kagaku
Kogyo -- were found by the agriculture ministry's inspection team to
have illegally sold tainted rice, some of which was used for school
lunches in Kyoto.

Companies have been able to find loopholes in the government's
regulation of rice, says Kazunuki Oizumi, a professor specializing in
agricultural management at Miyagi University in the northeastern
Japanese city of Sendai. According to Oizumi, the agriculture
ministry has streamlined the distribution system for domestically
produced rice, making it mandatory to state clearly on a package the
place and year of production and the quality of the rice. "But there
are no rules in the distribution of rice [imported under the World
Trade Organization], and there was room for dirty business
practices," says Oizumi. "If it is grained rice as powder, it's
difficult to track down who and what had been used."

A similar problem happened last year [2008] with eels, says Hisa
Anan, representative of the National Liaison Committee of Consumers'
Organizations. Companies mislabeled imported eels as domestic ones
and sold them at higher prices. "There is a system to make profits by
creating paper companies as intermediaries," says Anan. "It is
unforgivable that neither food traders nor the administration side
cares about end consumers."

Critics also blame the agriculture ministry's poor supervision of the
food industry. Since 2004, ministry officials inspected Mikasa 96
times but failed to uncover the illicit practices. However, since the
bureaucrats informed Mikasa well in advance of the inspections,
company officials readied themselves with two sets of books to cover
up illegal transactions, says a ministry official. Moreover, a
ministry official has admitted that he had been entertained by the
president of Mikasa in a bar in Osaka on 2 occasions. He denied
extending the company favors.

The government is taking action, though. On 19 Sep 2008,
Vice-Minister Toshiro Shirasu and Agriculture, Forestry & Fisheries
Minister Seiichi Ota assumed responsibility and resigned (although
they would have been replaced anyway 4 days later in a new cabinet
reshuffle). Police searched Mikasa Foods on 24 Sep 2008. Last week,
the agriculture ministry disclosed a list of 390 companies and
facilities which had bought tainted rice from Mikasa.

Among them, Asahi Breweries, Japan's biggest brewer, has recalled 650
000 bottles of shochu, or distilled spirits, at a cost of 1.5 billion
yen [USD 14 million]. "The safety of the products is proved by our
rigorous testing, but we seriously take to heart that ingredients
that should not have been used were used," says Masao Fujimori, a
spokesman for Asahi. Except for the brewer, most of the companies
that bought the rice are small and midsize and suffered severe blows.
On 19 Sep 2008, the president of Nakagawa, a company in Nara
Prefecture that bought bad rice from Mikasa and sold it as edible
grain, committed suicide.

The government is taking further action to reassure the public that
Japan's food supply is safe. It canceled tender of a 55 000-ton
shipment of foreign wheat and the planned purchase of 25 000 tons of
foreign rice. And the agriculture ministry said it would stop selling
rice for industrial use and incinerate existing imports. It also said
it would require rice traders to ship back any rice rejected for food
use at Japanese ports. That's angering traders. "It is totally
against global business customs," says Nobuyuki Chino, the president
of Unipack Grain, which deals in crops globally.

One of the repercussions of this scandal could be a growing aversion
by Japanese to foreign food products. "I think the tendency for
consumers to stay away from imported agricultural products will be
intensified," says Oizumi of Miyagi University.

However, consumers also tend to be realistic. [A] Tokyo housewife
points out it is simply impossible to meet demand for low-price
natto, or fermented soybeans, with domestic produce. Her local food
co-op found Chinese soybean farmers who could meet Japanese safety
requirements. But co-op customers were not impressed and have
complained about using Chinese produce. "They want to have natto with
100 percent domestic produce at the same low price. Of course, it is
just not feasible," [she] says.

Professor Oizumi says the series of food scares is good news for the
future of Japan's food safety. "More people have become interested,
and more care about food safety," he says. "This is a good step
forward to establish a proper system to secure food safety. It is as
if we were walking in the dark with a tiny torch, but now, because of
people's rising vigilance, some street lamps are on."

[Food safety is beginning to be highlighted in many nations across
the world. It becomes more of a challenge to meet quality, safety and
consumer driven price demands. Although profits for the producing
company or individual is always a driving force, the knowing and
willful act of committing a crime of poisoning other people is unconscionable.

Methamidophos is a breakdown product of the organophosphate
insecticide acephate (Orthene) and is also known by a variety of
other names including Tamanox, Tamaron, Swipe, Patrole, Nitofol,
Nuratron, Monitor, and Filitox.

Methamidophos is highly toxic via oral, dermal and inhalation routes
of exposure. The oral doses of methamidophos that resulted in the
mortality of half of the test organisms (LD50 values) are 21 and 16
mg/kg body weight for male and female rats respectively, 30-50 mg/kg
body weight in guinea pigs and 10-30 mg/kg body weight in rabbits.
Dermal LD50 values include 50 mg/kg body weight in rats and 118 mg/kg
body weight in rabbits (1). Inhalation LD50 values include 9 mg/kg in
rats, and 19 mg/kg in mice (2).

Early symptoms of acute organo-phosphate poisoning are dependent on
route of exposure, and usually develop during or shortly after
exposure (within 12 hours) (3). If inhaled, tightness in the chest,
wheezing, headache, blurred vision, pinpoint pupils, tearing and
runny nose are common early symptoms. If ingested, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, and cramps are the most common early signs of poisoning.
Sweating and twitching in the area of absorption are seen with skin
exposure. Weakness, shakiness, blurred vision, tightness in the
chest, sweating, confusion, changes in heart rate, convulsions, coma,
and cessation of breathing may occur with significant inhalation,
ingestion or dermal exposure (3). An intermediate syndrome has been
described in cases of poisonings in Sri Lanka, where patients
experienced paralysis of limb, neck, and respiratory muscles 24-96
hours after exposure. Delayed neurological problems (delayed
peripheral neuropathy) have been described 2-4 weeks after large
exposures to organophosphates, and include a loss of feeling and pins
and needles type of pains in the feet, legs, and hands (4,5).
Atropine is an antidote for organophosphate poisoning (3).

People with high blood pressure, gastrointestinal disorders, heart,
liver, lung, or nervous system problems may be more sensitive to methamidophos.
