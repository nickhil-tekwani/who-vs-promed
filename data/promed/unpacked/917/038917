Irish health officials are warning of a national outbreak of syphilis.

Syphilis is a bacterial infection usually spread by sexual contact. Untreated, it can cause serious health problems to the heart, brain, eyes, and nervous system, and complications may take many years to develop.

According to the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC), a national outbreak of early infectious syphilis (EIS) [primary and secondary syphilis] was declared and has been under investigation since June of this year [2021].

There are concerns that there may be "a large reservoir" of undiagnosed cases, as many STI [sexually transmitted infections] services have been operating at a reduced level due to the COVID-19 pandemic. "There is a potentially large undiagnosed reservoir of syphilis infection in Ireland due in part to the impact of COVID-19," the HPSC said. "Syphilis is a very STI and early recognition and treatment are critical to preventing avoidable morbidity for those infected and onward transmission to others."

Cases of EIS were rising prior to the pandemic, however, there was a small decrease in cases that coincided with Ireland's 1st [COVID-19] lockdown. The HPSC said infections are now increasing once more, exceeding the numbers observed in 2019 and previous years.

There were 242 cases reported in the 1st 4 months of this year [2021]. Dublin, Kildare, and Wicklow accounted for 79 percent of cases, followed by 9 per cent in Cork and Kerry. 91 percent of cases were in men, with 9 per cent were in women.

In 2020, there were 600 cases of early infectious syphilis (EIS) vs 782 in 2019, a 23% decline (https://www.hpsc.ie/a-z/sexuallytransmittedinfections/publications/stireports/2020reports/Weekly%20HIV%20&%20STI%20report%20Week%2053%202020.pdf). The decline was thought to be due closure of sexually transmitted disease clinics (STD) clinics and delays in reporting in 2020, as well as restrictions in social interactions during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 (https://www.irishtimes.com/news/health/rate-of-sexually-transmitted-infections-falls-amid-covid-19-pandemic-1.4267979). The STD clinic services are now operating.

In 2020, 92% of EIS cases were males. Similarly, as of 4 Nov 2019, of the 659 cases of EIS, 94% of cases were males (85% of cases were in men who have sex with men (MSM), where known) (https://www.hpsc.ie/a-z/sexuallytransmittedinfections/syphilis/surveillancereports/). Similarly, in 2018, of the 484 confirmed cases of EIS, 96% of cases were in males (86% of cases were in MSM, where known) and 40% of EIS cases were co-infected with HIV, where known (https://www.hpsc.ie/a-z/sexuallytransmittedinfections/syphilis/surveillancereports/Syphilis%20in%20Ireland,%202018%20(includes%20latest%20trends)%20v1.0.pdf). With loosening of social restrictions in 2021, a rise in syphilis transmission is anticipated, as reflected by the 242 cases reported so far in the 1st 4 months of this year (2021). - Mod.ML
