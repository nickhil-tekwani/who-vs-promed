The number of people sickened by the salmonella food poisoning outbreak at
the University of Western Ontario continued to climb yesterday [20 Nov
2007] as 11 new cases were confirmed, pushing the total to 64 lab-confirmed
cases. In addition to the 64 lab-confirmed cases, 56 people have reported
clinical symptoms of salmonella but haven't been tested, putting the total
number of cases at 120.

All cases reported so far would have become infected before the weekend
[17-18 Nov 2007] sanitization of the CentreSpot food court at Western that
has been tied to most of the illnesses, said Bryna Warshawsky, medical
officer of health. It will be next week before health officials are able to
tell if the clean up succeeded in wiping out the salmonella bacteria that
can cause fever, headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting,
Warshawsky said.

Without a lab test, it's impossible to know how many of the 56 showing
clinical signs actually have salmonella because symptoms are similar to
other infections. "It is hard to know exactly what the 56 means," she said.

New cases of salmonella have found Pita Pit was not the only source of food
poisoning. CentreSpot shut down Sat 17 Nov 2007, to accommodate extensive
sanitizing procedures.

On 9 Nov 2007, the Middlesex-London Health Unit conducted a thorough health
inspection at Pita Pit in the University Community Centre (UCC) after 5
cases of salmonella poisoning were linked to food served at the franchise
1-2 Nov 2007.

Since the original outbreak, many students have contacted the Health Unit,
reporting fever, vomiting, and diarrhea from eating at Pita Pit. The number
of lab-confirmed salmonella infections grew to 42 this weekend [17-18 Nov
2007], with an additional 44 students reporting symptoms consistent with
the bacterial infection.

Health inspectors at the Health Unit were surprised to discover 12 students
with lab-confirmed salmonella infections who had not eaten food prepared at
Pita Pit. In all 12 cases, students purchased food prepared at UCC
CentreSpot, Dr Bryna Warshawsky, associate medical officer of health at
MLHU (Middlesex-London Health Unit), confirmed.

Dr Warshawsky said the Health Unit has formulated a few hypotheses to
explain the cross-contamination. "We suspect the original source of
contamination occurred at Pita Pit around 2 Nov 2007, and that widespread
[contamination] happened the week of 5-9 Nov 2007," she said. The source of
the outbreak remains undetermined. "We are working really hard to figure
out what it is, to make sure it doesn't happen again," Dr Warshawsky said,
noting the Health Unit has already completed 9 inspections of the premises.

[This outbreak has grown over almost 3 weeks and now seems to be associated
with more than one restaurant at a food court. These suggest a continuing
source. Whether a common foodstuff was the source or the 2nd site was
secondarily affected is not clear. It is to be hoped that enough
epidemiological data will be collected to identify the vehicle or vehicles
here. The serotype of _Salmonella enterica_ involved has not not been stated.

The location of this outbreak is in London, Ontario, which can be seen in
the south western part of the province on the map at
