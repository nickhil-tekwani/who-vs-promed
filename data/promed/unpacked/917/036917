Measles in Ontario -- Update to Mon 14 Apr 2008
-----------------------------------------------
As of Mon 14 Apr 2008, 6 health regions in southern Ontario, Canada,
have reported 10 cases of IgM-positive measles since 19 Mar 2008. Of
those cases, 8 are epidemiologically linked either directly to or
through a generation of cases who attended a Toronto attraction and
were exposed to the initial case in this cluster. The source of this
initial infection is not known. The 1st reported case had rash onset
on 12 Mar 2008.

One of the cases is likely imported. This person travelled from a
high incidence measles area in the middle of the incubation period.
This case is confirmed to be a different genotype (D4). Five of the
epidemiologically linked cases have been genotyped so far and were
confirmed to have infection with D8 virus. Testing for genotype
confirmation is pending for the rest of the cases. Several
investigations for other reports of rash illness are still ongoing.

The 10 cases range in age from 6 to 42 years of age. One case had a
confirmed receipt of a single dose of measles containing vaccine,
another reported two doses, and the remaining cases were completely
unimmunized.

Contact tracing and follow-up is ongoing and includes the public
potentially exposed at school settings, day nurseries, doctor
offices, a hair salon, local hospitals, retail centres, restaurants,
and a Toronto attraction.

Unimmunized or incompletely vaccinated children attending day care
were excluded from attending these centres. People attending school
had to provide proof of 2 doses of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR)
vaccine to return. Susceptible exposed persons are being asked to
remain in self-enforced quarantine until past the maximal incubation
period and to call ahead when seeking medical assessment so that
arrangements can be made to avoid exposure of others. As per Canada's
National Advisory Committee on Immunization, persons born before 1970
and persons who have had 2 doses of measles-containing vaccine after
their 1st birthday are considered immune.

Measles is rare in Ontario. Over the last 5 years (2003 to 2007),
there were 25 cases of measles reported in Ontario. The number of
cases reported each year ranges from zero to 10 cases, with the
majority due to importation from countries with significantly higher
rates of measles.

Ontario law requires all school children to have 2 doses of measles
vaccine but children can be given exemptions on religious and
personal belief grounds. The law is less clear for children attending
day care as this is guided by recommendations from each local Medical
Officer of Health.

provision of this update. The presence of 2 genotypes in this
outbreak is interesting, one clearly imported and the other possibly
indigenous. - Mod.CP]

A comment in response to ProMED-mail Measles - Canada (02): Toronto
20080413.1341
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you Professor Gold, for sharing the reasoning behind Canada's
measles vaccine policy which currently considers birth prior to 1970
as evidence for probable immunity by natural infection. With all due
respect to the Canadian public health decision makers who clearly
have far greater expertise than I do, the data reflecting the
consequences of that assumption suggest the policy might need to be
reviewed. It would appear Canada experienced a similar problem during
the measles outbreak in 1985-6 with persons who received killed
measles vaccine and no subsequent boosters as we did here in the USA
in the 1991 epidemic.

In the following data reported by the CDC, at least 29 percent of
5260 cases of measles which occurred in Canada in 1986 were in
persons born before 1970. And according to Larke in the 2nd reference
here, "During the extensive measles epidemic in Alberta in 1979, a
high proportion of the reported cases occurred in adolescents and
young adults previously vaccinated with killed vaccine, and the
majority of these developed atypical measles syndrome."

(1) International Notes Update: Measles -- Canada, 198
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00000737.htm>

"Age data are available for 5260 (98 percent) of the 5367 cases
reported in Canada during the 1st 2 1/2 months of 1986 (Table 4).
Thirty-six percent of cases occurred among 10- to 14-year-olds; 29
percent, among 15- to 19-year-olds; and 21 percent, among 5- to
9-year-olds. The highest incidence rate (104/100 000) occurred for
10- to 14-year-olds. The rate for 15- to 19-year-olds and 5- to
9-year-olds was 77 cases and 61 cases/100 000, respectively. In 1985,
10- to 14-year-olds also had the highest incidence rate (45/100 000).

Editorial Note: Measles vaccine of several types, including
inactivated vaccine, has been used in Canada since 1964 (1). All
provinces now routinely use further attenuated measles vaccine
combined with mumps and rubella (MMR), which is recommended for use
at or after 12 months of age (2). The mean annual measles incidence
rate decreased from 358 cases/100 000 during the prevaccine era
(1949-1958) to 30/100 000 during 1976-1985, a 92 percent reduction.
The highest rate during the past 10 years was in 1979 -- 95/100 000
in 1979. The lowest reported incidence occurred in 1983--4/100 000."

Infect Dis 1983 May-Jun; 5(3):445-51.
<http://www.unboundmedicine.com/medline/ebm/record/6878997/full_citation/Impact_of_measles_in_Canada_?>

"Throughout recent years the age-specific incidence of reported cases
of measles has remained highest in the group 5 to 9 years of age, but
there has been a definite increase in the proportion of cases of
measles in persons greater than 10 years of age. During the extensive
measles epidemic in Alberta in 1979, a high proportion of the
reported cases occurred in adolescents and young adults previously
vaccinated with killed vaccine, and the majority of these developed
atypical measles syndrome."
