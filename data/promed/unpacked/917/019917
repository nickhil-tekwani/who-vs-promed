["Wild birds can normally carry AI (avian influenza) viruses in their respiratory or intestinal tracts but they do not commonly get sick, which allow them to carry the viruses on long distances along their migration flyways.... Therefore, limiting exposure of poultry to wild birds through confinement rearing and other biosecurity measures provides an opportunity to reduce the risk of introduction of avian influenza virus from wild birds."

Some countries in the Middle East are located along wild bird migratory routes, suggesting a likely source of transmission and spread of the virus along such routes. - Mod.CRD
