Virus which closed schools suspected in infant's death
------------------------------------------------------
Doctors suspect they have found the country's 1st fatality this year [2012] from enterovirus 71 (EV-71), which [among other enteroviruses] may cause hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD), and will submit the case to a virologists' meeting on Tuesday [24 Jul 2012] for confirmation. Passakorn Chaivanichsiri, Director of Nopparat Rajathanee Hospital on Ram Intra Road [Bangkok], said EV-71 was thought to have been found in the body of a 2-and-a-half-year girl who died on 19 Jul 2012. He said the infant showed no related symptoms of the disease such as ulcers in the throat, mouth and tongue or any rash. She suffered damage to her heart, lungs and brain.

According to Dr Passakorn the hospital conducted a proper screening and diagnosis and the result came back negative for HFMD. However, "the results of a throat culture show [signs of] EV-71, a strain that can cause serious complications," he said.

A source close to the hospital said the infant was in critical condition when she was admitted to the hospital. The Disease Control Department earlier denied her death was caused by the HFMD virus after a lumbar puncture test and stool examination did not reveal the presence of the disease. The girl's father said his daughter had visited a school before she fell ill.

Pornthep Siriwanarangsan, director general of the Public Health Ministry's Disease Control department, urged parents not to be afraid of an outbreak of HFMD. He said the public health system's preventative measures are highly effective. A temporary shutdown of some schools is in place as a precaution to contain a likely outbreak.

According to Dr Pornthep, HFMD killed 6 people out of 18 196 patients last year [2011]. The mortality rate was 0.01 per 100 000 people. Dr Prasert Thongcharoen, an adviser to the Disease Control Department, said the laboratory tests on the girl will be submitted to virologists on Tuesday [24 Jul 2012] to confirm the cause of death. "Parents should not panic about this as the situation is not unusual. Over the past 5 years, Thailand has averaged 8000 - 18 000 HFMD patients a year with between 2 and 6 deaths," he said.

Public Health Minister Witthaya Buranasiri yesterday [21 Jul 2012] gave assurances that state and private hospitals are highly capable of handling HFMD. He said parents seem to be well informed about how to take action to stop the disease. He urged schools and child-care centres to maintain high hygiene standards even without any sign of an outbreak. "There is no need to wait for an outbreak to step up sanitation. Parents should wash their hands before holding their children. They must keep up their personal hygiene or they may pass on the disease to children," he said.

Gov't seeks public's help against EV-71
---------------------------------------
The Department of Health (DOH) earlier reported that a 19-month-old toddler from Davao City in southern Philippines has been infected with human enterovirus 71 (EV-71), the same virus that has killed more than 60 children in Cambodia. The boy was the only confirmed case among 8 suspected cases in the country with the hand, foot and mouth disease, Health Secretary Enrique Ona has said. The [virus] strain detected in the boy was a mild form of EV-71 and could have been in the country long before its deadlier variant killed Cambodian children, Ona noted.

In an interview with state-run radio station, Presidential Spokesman Edwin Lacierda [gave assurances] that the Department of Health (DOH) is preparing to handle EV-71. "We need the participation of the citizenry. If you feel that there are symptoms that would lead to EV-71 infection, immediately bring [them] to the attention of the doctors," he said. He said a person should not wait for the illness to become serious before going to a hospital.

[Laboratory confirmation of the EV-71 case in Thailand is awaited. The case in the Philippines indicates that EV-71 infection is wide-spread in South-east Asia and China at the present time, and that the signs and symptoms of EV-71 infection may not always be either severe or even characteristic of HFMD.
