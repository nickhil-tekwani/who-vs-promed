FOOT & MOUTH DISEASE - TAIWAN (08)
==================================
Date: Mon 8 April
I have just now spoken with Alex Donaldson, Director of the Pirbright
Laboratory, UK, and head of their Division of Epidemiology. He tells me that
they received samples from Taiwan on March 24th and confirmed by 10pm that
night that it was FMDV O1.
It is apparently a substrain seen recently in the Philippines and in Hong
Kong; the latter presumeably reflects virus strains seen in southern China.
FMDV O1 has a long history of being airborne.
