Hunter Valley horse owners are being urged to be aware of the risks of equine herpesvirus (EHV). An EHV-1 abortion occurred on a local property last week, and during the 2018 breeding season, a number of others were reported to Hunter Local Land Services (LLS).

There are many different EHVs that may infect horses. EHV-1 causes respiratory disease, abortion and neurological disease in horses and is a significant problem in the industry throughout the world. Once infected with EHV-1, a horse becomes a lifelong carrier of the virus, which may then reactivate and be shed during periods of stress.

Hunter LLS district vet Dr. Kristi Arnot said it was a crucial time for horse owners to be monitoring for signs of EHV. "Most mares are now due or will soon be due for their 5-month vaccine, the 1st in the series of 3 they need," she explained.

"Horse owners need to be aware of so-called 'abortion storms' where one EHV-related abortion in a single mare may be followed a few weeks later by abortions in multiple mares on the farm if strict biosecurity practices are not followed.

"For more than a decade now this disease has been managed in Australia by a combination of vaccination programs and management practices in an attempt to reduce the risk of abortion storms."

Most [breeding barns with] horse studs will have an EHV policy in place for visiting mares. It is recommended vaccination status be checked and preferably verified. Treating veterinarians should be able to state when vaccination has occurred, as vaccination is available only via veterinarians.

Some factors that have been associated with EHV-1 abortion include:

- Stress, including transporting mares late in gestation
- Mixing groups of pregnant mares late in gestation
- Co-mingling pregnant mares with barren mares and young horses (e.g., weanlings/yearlings)
- Failing to follow strict biosecurity and hygiene protocols following an initial EHV-1 abortion case
- Mares purchased pregnant and unvaccinated

Susceptible mares may inhale or ingest EHV-1 from the following sources:

- Aerosols, fluids or foetal matter from aborted mares
- Young horses with "colds"
- Clinically healthy carrier horses
- Pasture, feed bins, water troughs, halters, rugs, bedding, floats and staff clothing that have been in contact with affected horses

"After an abortion, mares clear the virus from their reproductive tracts in a few days but can shed virus from their respiratory tract for up to 14 days," Dr. Arnot said.

"The virus may remain infective in the environment and on horse hair for up to 6 weeks in cool, moist conditions. EHV is a notifiable disease in NSW [New South Wales] and must be reported to the Department of Primary Industries, with aborted foetuses to be sent for laboratory diagnosis."

It is important the mare that has aborted is isolated immediately, until the diagnosis is confirmed. During an outbreak, the movement of horses on and off a farm may be restricted. This will include the movement of horses to other farms to be covered by stallions or for foaling and the movement of horses for sales.

Talk to a veterinarian about how best to protect horses. If anything unusual is noticed or any plant or animal disease threat observed, phone Hunter LLS on 1300 795 299.

[While this article does a good job of pointing out what needs to happen, the Queensland Industry website has expanded on it. The instructions provided are helpful if you are unfamiliar with disease.

Actions if an aborted foal is found:
- Isolate the mare from contact with all other horses.
- Leave her halter and lead rope with her in isolation.
- Call your veterinary surgeon.
- Wear gloves to pick up the foetus and placenta and put them in a strong plastic bag.
- Keep the foetus and placenta cool (not frozen) for the veterinarian to examine and to preserve it until it, or samples from it, can be sent to the laboratory.
- Fence off and treat the contaminated pasture with lime.

Anyone who has had contact with the aborted mare or the foetus or placenta should:
- Disinfect hands and boots with a good surface disinfectant, for example, iodophors (Iovone Scrub), hexachlorophenes (Hibitane or other chlorhexidine disinfectant) or phenols (Polyphen Polyphenolic Microbiocide).
- Shower and change clothes. Washing and sun-drying clothes will effectively kill the virus.
- Disinfect the vehicle used to transport the aborted mare to quarantine (inside and wheels) and anything that has come in contact with the foetus, foetal fluids or discharge from the mare.

Until a diagnosis has been made:
- Keep the mare completely isolated.
- Avoid entering the quarantine yard at all if possible or use a 5% formalin footbath outside the yard to disinfect footwear.
- Provide the isolated mare with her own feed bin and other equipment, and do not use them for any other horse.
- Make sure the isolated mare is cared for by someone who does not work with other horses or who disinfects, showers and changes before they do.

Disease introduction can be prevented and disease spread restricted by good management practices:
- Keep weanlings, yearlings and non-breeding stock in a separate part of the farm with their own facilities and staff.
- Separate pregnant mares from non-pregnant mares and from mares with foals.
- Keep resident mares separated from mares visiting only for the stud season.
- Isolate visiting mares on arrival at stud for 3 to 4 weeks. Keep them in small groups of 2 or 3, which can be combined if they remain disease-free.
- Minimise stress factors for pregnant mares such as overcrowding and transport in the last 2 months of gestation, and provide access to good quality feed and ensure adequate parasite control.
- Establish isolation facilities equipped with gloves, plastic bags, disinfectant, etc.
- Clean and disinfect horse floats after each journey.
- Train staff so they understand about isolation and the principles of preventing disease spread. Implement hygiene procedures that will help prevent spread of disease.
- Keep accurate records of mares (e.g., date of arrival, where from, previous stud details) and of movements of horses on the farm. These are essential for identifying the source of infection.
- Consider vaccinating pregnant mares in the 5th, 7th and 9th months of pregnancy, which will help reduce the risk of abortion.

There is no specific treatment for EHV-1 infection in mares. Most foals infected with EHV-1 before birth succumb within a few days despite nursing and antibiotic administration.

In-contact pregnant mares should be isolated until they foal and for 30 days after foaling or, if another mare aborts, 30 days after the last abortion. In-contact mares include those in the same paddock as the aborted foetus and those in direct contact with the mares in the same paddock (e.g., sharing a water trough or in direct contact over a single fence line).
