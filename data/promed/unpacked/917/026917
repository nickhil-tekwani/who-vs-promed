Second man dies from tropical mosquitoborne virus infection
-----------------------------------------------------------
A man from the Gold Coast has died in Darwin from a deadly mosquitoborne
virus [infection]. [The 83 year old man] is the 2nd person to die in Darwin
this year [2009] after contracting the Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE)
virus. The grandfather of 13 died at Royal Darwin Hospital (RDH) on
Saturday morning [23 May 2009] after spending time in Darwin's coastal
region, a spokesman for the NT [Northern Territory] Health Department has
confirmed.

MVE is transmitted by the common banded mosquito, which bites after sundown
in the 1st 2 hours of the night. About one person in 1000 bitten by
infected mosquitoes contracts the disease. One in 4 of these people die
from the infection.

In a funeral notice published in today's [27 May 2009] Northern Territory
News, the deceased man's family described his death as "unexpected."

A mango farmer died in March [2009] from brain failure after contracting
MVE at his home in Batchelor, 100 km [62 mi] south of Darwin. The 58 year
old farmer went into a coma 2 weeks before his death, but the NT health
department was widely criticised for only issuing a warning about the virus
on the day his wife decided to turn off his life support. The farmer's
death was the first from MVE in the Darwin region for almost a decade.

Initial symptoms of the virus include fever, drowsiness, headache, stiff
neck, nausea, and dizziness. There is tremor and seizures especially in
young children, with the virus in some cases progressing to delirium and
coma, leading to paralysis or brain damage.

The deadly virus killed a man in Western Australia last year [2008]. While
such fatalities are rare, doctors say people must cover up and avoid being
bitten because there's no specific treatment for MVE. A warning about MVE
was reissued when the 83 year old man contracted the disease, although the
NT Health Department did not alert the public to his death. The [man's]
family have asked for people to donate money for MVE research at the
Menzies School of Health Research instead of bringing flowers to his
funeral, to be held in the Gold Coast this Friday [29 May 2009].

Department defends withholding death details
--------------------------------------------
The Northern Territory Health Department is defending its decision to
withhold information that a 2nd person had died from the mosquitoborne
disease Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE). An 83 year old Gold Coast man
died in Royal Darwin Hospital on Saturday [23 May 2009] after contracting
the disease, which kills one in 4 people infected with it. The man's death
followed the mid-March [2009] death of a Darwin mango farmer.

But while the health department has continually issued warnings about the
disease, including when [the man] was first diagnosed, it did not reveal
that he had died at the weekend [23 May 2009]. His death was only reported
in the media this morning [Wed 27 May 2009], after his family placed a
death notice in the Northern Territory News.

The head of the Centre for Disease Control, Vicki Krause, says she did not
immediately inform the public of the death so that his family had time to
grieve. But the deceased's widow has told the ABC she wants people to know
about his disease so they better protect themselves against mosquitos. The
Territory opposition leader, Terry Mills, says the public should have been
told about the death immediately so they can understand the seriousness of
the threat.

Dr Krause says she has made continuous public warnings about MVE. Following
this morning's [27 May 2009] media reports, the Department of Health and
Families put out a media release to again remind people to take precautions
against mosquitoes. The department says the 83 year old man was bitten by a
mosquito in a rural, coastal area near Darwin, where more than 13 000
common banded mosquitos have recently been caught. Tests are underway to
determine if they [are carrying the virus]. The department says other tests
have revealed the disease, along with another dangerous mosquitoborne
disease called Kunjin, is widespread across the Top End. However, only one
in 1000 people who are bitten by infected mosquitos will catch MVE.
