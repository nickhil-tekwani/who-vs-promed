-------------------------------------------------------
In the above posting, data on sheep pox [SP] vaccinations in Israel during recent years were presented. ProMED-mail requested information on Israel's sheep pox vaccination policy since 2013.

We received a response from an EpiCore Global Surveillance Project member who is gratefully acknowledged.

The said response, combined with additional information derived from the annual (Hebrew) reports of Israel's Veterinary Services & Animal Health (VSAH) and from the semi-annual reports to the OIE/WAHID, are presented in the following short review. We also include summaries of recent VSAH circulars to the country's practitioners and stakeholders addressing changes in Israel's SP vaccination policy.

Since 1976, a live attenuated vaccine (sheep-pox RM/65 strain; refs 1, 2) has been used in Israel. For many years, the vaccine, produced locally and applied in the flocks by the personnel of the State's VSAH, seemed to confer satisfactory protection, as far as it could be assessed by clinical field observations. The vaccinations themselves (injections to animals) were applied consistently around outbreaks and selectively in strategic locations.

In 2000, the efficacy of the vaccine came into doubt when losses were observed in several flocks in spite of vaccination. In 2006, a record number of SP outbreaks was noted, some of them affecting vaccinated flocks. This led the VSAH to seek another vaccine producer and to implement a new policy: compulsory, nationwide annual SP vaccination of the entire sheep population. This change was followed by decreased SP incidence, as can be seen in the graph "Number of Sheep pox outbreaks 1990-2013", published in Israel's last available detailed annual report (go to page 30 at http://www.moag.gov.il/DocLib/doch_shnati_2013.pdf.

The numbers of outbreaks after 2013 were: 2014 - 2, 2015 - 1.

The following recent official documents, issued by VSAH, present recent changes in Israel's SP vaccination policy:

1. Circular of the Field Veterinary Services, VSAH, dated 13 Nov 2014: "The application of the SP vaccine is to be privatised, in effect 1 Jan 2015. The vaccinations remain compulsory, performed by certified veterinarians who are obliged to report detailed vaccination data to the VSAH, VSAH certified SP vaccine from 2 manufaturers."

2. Circular of the CVO, VSAH, dated 20 Apr 2016: "Cancellation of the compulsory vaccination of sheep against sheep pox. The vaccination becomes voluntary, following the advice of the attending private practitioner. Upon notified outbreak, VSAH may implement compulsory vaccination in the affected region. The vaccine manufacturers/distributors and the practitioners will be required to report, respectively, the sales/quantities of the vaccine and its application to the VSAH."

3. Circular of the Field Veterinary Services, VSAH, dated 20 Apr 2016. Guidelines for SP vaccinations:
"a. Lambs: progeny of vacccinated ewes - minimal age 2 months; progeny of unvaccinated ewes - age 1 day.
b. Booster adult sheep: annual."

The following SP vaccination figures from Israel are available in OIE's WAHIS interface:
Year / vaccinations / sheep population
2010 / 524 032 / 435 000
2011 / 584 721 / 525 000
2012 / 651 087 / 525 000
2013 / 612 / 525 000
2014 / 0 / 435 000
2015 / 0 / 435 000

Confirmation of the above vaccination figures, in particular pertaining to 2013, 2014, 2015 will be helpful. Since vaccinating practitioners are required by law to report the names of locations, dates and number of vaccinations, the VSAH should be able to continue the reporting of the said significant data to the OIE.
