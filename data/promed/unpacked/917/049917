Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship State Veterinarian Jeff Kaisand, DVM, has confirmed 2 cases of West Nile virus (WNV) have been detected in horses living in the southern part of the state. These are the 1st confirmed cases of WNV in Iowa horses this year [2019].

The Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported last week [week of 1 Jul 2019] that cases were confirmed in Davis and Union counties.

In Davis county, a 15-year-old thoroughbred mare began displaying clinical signs, including hind-limb ataxia (incoordination) and muscle fasciculations (involuntary twitching) on 24 Jun 2019, the EDCC said. Diagnostic testing confirmed WNV on 28 Jun 2019.

"The horse is being treated and reported (to be) recovering," the EDCC said. "The mare was not vaccinated for WNV this year [2019] but has a history of vaccination 2 years ago."

In Union county, a 2-year old quarter horse gelding in Union county tested positive for WNV on [19 Jun 2019]. The gelding was displaying mild clinical signs and had no history of vaccination against WNV.

West Nile virus is transmitted to horses via bites from infected mosquitoes. Not all infected horses show clinical signs, but those that do can exhibit:
- flulike signs, where the horse seems mildly anorexic and depressed;
- fine and coarse muscle and skin fasciculation;
- hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound);
- changes in mentation (mentality), when horses look like they're daydreaming or "just not with it";
- occasional drowsiness;
- propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control); and
- spinal signs, including asymmetrical weakness; and
- asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia.

West Nile has no cure, however some horses can recover with supportive care. Equine mortality rates can reach 30-40 percent.

Studies have shown that vaccines can be effective WNV prevention tools. Horses vaccinated in past years need an annual booster shot, but veterinarians might recommend 2 boosters annually -- 1 in the spring and another in the fall -- in areas with prolonged mosquito seasons. In contrast, previously unvaccinated horses require a 2-shot vaccination series in a 3- to 6-week period. It takes several weeks for horses to develop protection against the disease following complete vaccination or booster administration.

In addition to vaccinations, owners should work to reduce mosquito population and breeding areas and limit horses' mosquito exposure by:

- removing stagnant water sources;
- dumping, cleaning, and refilling water buckets and troughs regularly;
- keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times (typically early in the morning and evening); and
- applying mosquito repellents approved for equine use.

[Choosing to protect your horse from one disease also means it needs protection from multiple diseases. Use of combination vaccines in most cases is the best method. The vaccines generally come in combination of West Nile virus, Eastern and Western equine encephalitis, and tetanus. Your horse may need an initial injection followed by a 2nd injection approximately 3 weeks later.

Reduce or eliminate any standing water providing breeding places for mosquitoes. This may include the water in the catch pan of potted plants or in old tires, or persistent standing water from a break in a pipe. Sometimes with heavy rains or prolonged rainy seasons, eliminating standing water is even more important.

While using smoke to drive off the mosquitoes may work, it may also cause your horse some respiratory trouble. If using fly/mosquito repellent, be sure it is approved for use on horses. This is critical so as not to poison your horse when seeking to help it. - Mod.TG
