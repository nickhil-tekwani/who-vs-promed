Bluetongue, sheep - Spain (Balearic Islands): OIE report 20001125.2055

Official information from the Spanish Agriculture Ministry is really scarce
and difficult to obtain and understand. However, a few months ago the
Ministry bought a huge number of vaccine doses (approximately 400 000) to
vaccinate the entire affected ovine population in the Balearic Islands and
official veterinary teams were sent to these islands to collaborate with
their veterinary services.
As indicated by a veterinary news organization, the outbreak affected the
Islands of Mallorca (at least 79 herds with 500 sheep) and Menorca (61
herds with 1000 sheep) and at least 767 died (ewes and lambs) by 10 Oct
2000. A few days later it was declared more than 3000 sheep were
clinically affected only on Menorca, with 600 dying and 800 being euthanized.
According to official veterinary authorities (Conselleria de Sanidad Animal
de Baleares), only 30 ovine herds in Menorca and 63 in Mallorca were
affected, comprising 3591 sheep out of a total 394 000 in the Balearic
ovine population.
The affected villages (and sheep herds) are: Arta (10), Capdepera (9),
Felanitx (15), Manacor (2), Petra (2), Son Servera (17) y Sant Llorenc (7).

Today the more recent outbreaks of Bluetongue (BT) in Europe are located in
Italy (Calabria and the islands Sardinia and Sicily), France (island of
Corsica), Spain (Balearic islands), Greece and Bulgaria. Furthermore,
outbreaks were recorded in Turkey, Tunisia and Algeria. Tunisian, Algerian
and Italian strains are serotype 2; Bulgaria 9; Greece 4 and 9; Turkey 4.
Algeria, Turkey and Bulgaria are suspected wind-borne outbreaks. Sardinia
and Sicily are close to Algeria and Tunisia (about 200 km). In literature
the most likely hypothesis of long-distance transmission reported for BT
and African Horse Sickness is by wind.
For the island of Sardinia, where outbreaks involving more than 250 000
sheep and goats have been recorded since the end of August, it is difficult
to suppose a recent arrival of the infected midges. Nevertheless a huge
effort is required to complete the epidemiological picture of
intercontinental transfer of the BT virus and other arthropod-borne diseases.
Most of the reported information and further details can be found at OIE -
