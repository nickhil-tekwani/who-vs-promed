A total of 6 more cases of measles were confirmed in Latvia which leads to 11 confirmed cases in total, said Riga Austrumi (Eastern) Clinical University Hospital representative Velga Kuse.

As reported, at the end of last year [2017] the Center for Disease Prevention and Control reported on several cases of measles in Latvia.

Kuse said that, considering the long incubation period of the disease, more cases are possible during the present outbreak.

As reported, this was the 1st outbreak of measles in Latvia in the past 3 years.

The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) at the end of 2017 reported on 13 726 cases of measles registered between November 2016 until 31 Oct 2017, in the EU and EEA. The majority of cases were registered in Romania (5605), Italy (4973) and Germany (952).

According to the Center for Disease Prevention and Control's estimates, around 95 percent of Latvia's population might be immune to measles - those born in the 1960s have probably had the infection as children and younger people have received one or 2 jabs against measles.

The influenza season is likewise in full swing in the country. Likewise, an outbreak of salmonellosis took place at one of Riga's schools, with 56 children falling ill within the past few weeks.

A year from measles in Europe died at 35. The vast majority of deaths from measles [in Europe] are recorded in Romania -- 31. The world health organization has called "unacceptable tragedy" death from infectious disease, which can be prevented through vaccination. Over the past year [2017] the mortality from measles in Europe has grown almost 3 times - 13 deaths [in 2016], and in 2015 only 3.

The Russian Federal service for supervision of consumer rights protection and human welfare (Rospotrebnadzor) reported a measles outbreak in 14 countries of Europe from the beginning of 2017. For this period, doctors have addressed more than 4000 patients in Austria, Romania, Bulgaria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Hungary, France, Germany, Sweden, Italy, Portugal, Iceland, Spain and Switzerland. [Even] with the availability of a safe and affordable vaccine against measles, the disease remains a major cause of child mortality.

Most patients and most of all deaths were registered in Romania. There are also cases of transmission to medical staff. The number of cases is growing and already in the thousands. In Italy from January -- 21 Apr 2017, [there have been] 1739 confirmed cases of measles. It affects mostly children and teenagers. Up to 88 percent of the patients were never vaccinated. Nearly 40 percent had to be hospitalized, 33 percent had at least one complication.

Experts suggest that the spread of measles was made possible because of the reduction in the number of vaccinated population in Europe, and the lack of restrictive measures in the regions.

Measles is a highly contagious viral disease transmitted by airborne droplets. It is characterized by high fever, inflammation of the mucous membranes and typical skin rash. Measles [affects] mostly children under the age of 2 -- 5 years; grownups endure sickness longer than children.

Will there be a measles epidemic Russia?
In Russia, according to the Association of paediatric infectious diseases, the incidence of measles in the 1st quarter of 2017 increased compared to the same period of the previous year by 2.9 times. Of the 43 registered cases, 19 were children under the age of 18 years. Cases of measles registered in the Republic of Dagestan (18), Moscow region (6), Moscow (3), Rostov (3), the Republic of North Ossetia and the Sverdlovsk region (2 cases), the republics of Ingushetia, Bashkortostan, Kabardino-Balkar, and Chechen republics, Stavropol region, Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug, Nizhny Novgorod, Astrakhan, Chelyabinsk regions (in one case).

"In our country," said Deputy Minister of health of Moscow region, pediatrician, Professor Irina Soldatova, "measles vaccination is included in national immunization schedule. The 1st vaccination is carried out in a year-old child, the 2nd in 6 years. We have a very efficient domestic vaccine. And it is important for everyone - children and adults - who for whatever reason are not vaccinated against measles to get vaccinated. To learn if you have antibodies to measles, you can take a blood test and find out if you have adequate antibody levels for protection. In Russia, there is a sufficient amount of vaccine to ensure everyone is protected from dangerous diseases.

You can just search the recent history to obtain evidence of the effectiveness of vaccination. Then, 50 years ago, the Soviet Union began the polls to vaccinate children against measles. And that is the "children's infection" which was considered almost obligatory for a child, began to retreat.

We now have the most children vaccinated, but do not vaccinate as many parents, despite the growth of the antiprivivochnaya sentiment. But those few unvaccinated children will get sick, if faced with a measles virus because of immunity they [lack].

Experts say that despite the number of unvaccinated children in Russia, there will not be an epidemic in the country. The increased incidence may occur, but there will not be an epidemic, thanks to a good collective immunity.

What about the trips?
Now in Europe, there is active vaccination of the population, as well as wide sanitary-educational work. In some countries, penalties are applied for refusals of vaccinations. For example, in Germany parents refusing to vaccinate a child face a fine of 2.5 thousand euros. Despite this, the CPS recommends the citizens of Russia to consider the situation when deciding on a trip to a particular country, as Roma measles outbreaks in Europe from vaccine refusal was the increase in the incidence of chickenpox and mumps. In addition, there are cases of hepatitis. However, these are all diseases, from which in any case must be instilled to all, regardless of travel plans.

A deadly measles-and-malnutrition outbreak that killed scores of children in Indonesia's remote Papua province is over, authorities said.

Official figures showed a total of 72 children died while hundreds more were sickened as a result of the "extraordinary" outbreak, which hit several isolated communities in Papua's Asmat district between September 2017 and [Sun 4 Feb 2018], local officials said.

No new measles cases had been identified following the deployment of military and medical teams to the region last month [January 2018].

"The extraordinary status of the measles event has been revoked and is over," Asmat district chief Elisa Kambu said in a letter dated [Mon 5 Feb 2018].

No figures were given for the number of children sickened but earlier official figures said the number topped 800.

The statement marks a de-escalation of a health crisis 1st made public in mid-January that highlighted a severe lack of medical care and other basic services in a far-flung island region.

Earlier reports suggested more than 2 dozen other children and adults had died in a remote community, but their deaths came earlier than the outbreak's official date range.

Papua ... remains the most impoverished region in the sprawling Southeast Asian archipelago....

President Joko Widodo ordered military and medical teams to several locations across the vast region to treat the sick and undertake a mass immunisation campaign.

But the head of the military medical teams acknowledged to AFP that Jakarta's response was slow.

Observers blamed the crisis on a complex mix of government inaction, lack of jobs, logistical hurdles in reaching remote communities and resettlement efforts that pose a serious threat to many Papuans' traditional hunting-based lifestyles.

Community and Public Health is investigating a 2nd case of measles in Christchurch.

An 11-year-old child is recovering at home after contracting the virus in a general practice waiting room.

Canterbury Medical Officer of Health, Dr Alistair Humphrey, says the child contracted measles after coming into contact with a 30-year-old man who contracted the virus overseas. The man has now recovered from the virus.

"These are the 1st cases of measles in Canterbury since May 2017. Community and Public Health staff are now working to contain any potential spread."

Investigations have shown the child attended 2 days of school, a church service, ate in a restaurant and played in a popular inner-city playground before they were diagnosed. They also attended their medical practice.

Dr Humphrey says the people that the child came into contact with during those occasions are potentially at risk of contracting measles.

"We are working with the medical centre and school to ensure people who were exposed to the virus in those locations are contacted. We also need to warn those who were at the church, restaurant and the playground that they have been exposed."

[See URL for risk associated with specific locations child visited.] ... - more

The early symptoms of measles include fever, cough, runny nose, sore red eyes and white spots inside the mouth. After 3 -- 5 days a rash may appear.

Dr Humphrey says the re-emergence of the virus is a timely reminder to everyone in our community to ensure that they are fully immunised.
"The scheduled vaccinations are free from your general practice and some pharmacies. Measles is a very serious illness and we need to work together to ensure the South Island returns to its measles-free status."

http://outbreaknewstoday.com/measles-venezuela-nearly-1000-cases-reported-past-year-19788/


For the period between January 2017 and January 2018, 952 measles cases were reported in Venezuela (732 by laboratory and 220 by epidemiological link), according to UN officials.

Most of the cases are from Bolívar state, accounting for 82 percent of the total confirmed cases, although there were cases reported in Apure, Anzoategui, Delta Amacuro, the Capital District, Miranda, Monagas, Vargas, and Zulia. The municipality of Caroni, Bolivar State, is the epicenter of the outbreak.

The spread of the virus to other geographical areas is explained by the presence of factors such as the high migratory movement of the population due to formal and informal economic activity around mining and commercial activity.

The most affected age group among the confirmed cases are children under 5 years of age, accounting for 59 percent of the confirmed cases, followed by the group of 6 -- 15 years of age, accounting for 30 percent of the confirmed cases.

As part of the intervention, a National Rapid Response Plan was designed to interrupt the transmission of the virus, including the use of regional and municipal rapid response teams, the implementation of vaccination strategies and activities, epidemiological surveillance, contact tracing and follow up, and training of health personnel; supported technically by the national level.

A "fully vaccinated" graduate student who lives off campus has been diagnosed with measles, Carnegie Mellon University said in a campus-wide email [Fri 9 Feb 2018].

The Allegheny County Health Department, while not identifying the patient, confirmed a case of measles and said that others on the CMU campus may have been exposed, along with riders on certain Port Authority bus routes.

The Health Department released the following statement [Fri 9 Feb 2018] night:

The Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD) has confirmed the diagnosis of measles in an Allegheny County resident. As that resident was mobile and potentially exposed others, the Health Department is urging anyone who is susceptible to measles, may have been in the same location during the indicated times, and become ill with symptoms of measles between now and [Thu 15 Feb 2018] to contact their primary care provider immediately.

The resident diagnosed with measles was potentially contagious from [Wed 17-Thu 25 Jan 2018]. During that time, the individual was on the Carnegie Mellon University campus and also rode Port Authority of Allegheny County buses between Oakland and Squirrel Hill multiple times during that time frame. [See URL above for bus routes affected.] ACHD has been working closely with both Carnegie Mellon University and the Port Authority so they may also notify their respective constituencies.

Measles is caused by a highly contagious virus. Symptoms begin 7 -- 21 days after exposure and include a runny nose, red and watery eyes, cough and a high fever. After 4 days, a raised, red rash begins on the face and spreads downward to neck, trunk and extremities. The rash usually lasts 4 -- 7 days. The last day the Health Department expects symptoms to appear is [Thu 15 Feb 2018]. While the potential for additional cases is limited, and there are no additional cases of measles in Allegheny County at this time, people should be aware of the risk.

"If you believe you have symptoms of measles, and have been in the locations noted above, please contact your primary care provider immediately to notify them that you may have been exposed," said ACHD Director Dr. Karen Hacker. "Do not go directly to the office, urgent care center or emergency room, as this may expose other persons. Pregnant women should contact their doctor about their immune status.

While most people are not at risk because they have been immunized or have had measles, the following groups of individuals are susceptible to becoming infected with measles:

- Anyone born since 1957 who has not received 2 doses of effective measles vaccine known as MMR, which includes infants too young to have been immunized; persons who were vaccinated with an inactivated vaccine (used from 1963 through 1967) and have not been re-vaccinated; and those who refused vaccination.

- Persons whose immune systems are compromised due to disease or medication.

An individual with measles can spread the virus to others for 4 days before and 4 days after the rash begins. It is spread by infected droplets during sneezing or coughing, touching contaminated objects, and direct contact with infected nasal or throat secretions. Infected droplets and secretions can remain in the air and on surfaces for up to 2 hours.

Complications from measles can include ear infection, diarrhea and pneumonia, encephalitis (an inflammation of the brain), and even death. Measles can also cause miscarriages or premature delivery in pregnant women.

The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is given to toddlers when they are 12 -- 15 months of age, and a 2nd MMR vaccine is required for all Pennsylvania school children. However, individuals who have received only one dose of the vaccine, instead of the recommended 2 doses, may still be susceptible to the virus.

Adults born during or after 1957 who have not had 2 doses of vaccine or documented disease should be vaccinated with one dose of MMR vaccine. The MMR vaccine also can help prevent infection if it is given within 3 days of exposure.

The Health Department recommends that any person who is due for measles vaccination schedule an appointment to receive it from their medical provider. The vaccine is also available at the Health Department's immunization clinic. There is no risk in getting an additional dose of the MMR vaccine for individuals who may have already received it.

Epidemiological Update Measles 6 Feb 2018
-----------------------------------------
Summary of the situation
------------------------
Between November 2016 and December 2017, countries of the WHO European Region reported 17 584 measles cases; 91 percent (n=15 978) of these cases were reported in 2017. In this period, the highest cumulative incidence rate was reported in Romania (291.5 cases per one million population), followed by Italy (83.2 cases per one million population), and Tajikistan (77.2 cases per one million population). The WHO European Region monthly summary of the measles epidemiological data by country is available at: http://bit.ly/2BZJWW6. Of the reported cases in the European Region between January and October 2017 (n=15 978), 55percent (8842) were confirmed by laboratory testing (serology, virus detection, or isolation) and 45 percent (7,136) were classified as epidemiologically linked or clinically compatible (Figure 1). There were 26 measles deaths reported, 15 of which were reported in Romania. The identified genotypes in the countries with the highest incidence rates were B3 and D8 in Romania, B3, D8, and H1 in Italy, and H1 in Tajikistan. Most of the cases were reported in the age group between 0 and 14 years of age, accounting for 57 percent of the total cases. Countries in other continents (China, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Mongolia, Nigeria, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Thailand, and Vietnam, among others) have also reported measles outbreaks between 2016 and 2017.
