At least one deer in northeast Anacortes has died as a result of a viral infection, adenovirus hemorrhagic disease [AHD] according to the state Department of Fish and Wildlife. Officials say testing of tissue samples from a buck found dead [18 Jul 2021] near Cap Sante Park confirmed the animal had adenovirus hemorrhagic disease. The lab is now examining samples from a fawn found dead [25 Jul 2021] in the same area. The results are expected next week.

There have been at least 5 fawns, one buck, and one doe found dead in the area this month [July 2021], likely due to AHD.

AHD was first documented in Washington state in late August 2017 in a mule deer herd east of Goldendale in Klickitat County, but likely was present before that, experts say. It also was confirmed in June 2021 in the San Juan Islands. This type of AHD is specific to deer and has been found in other states, including Oregon.

Adenoviruses belong to a small group of viruses infecting a variety of animals, both wild and domestic. AHD in deer was first identified in California in 1994.

AHD specific to deer does not pose a risk to livestock, pets, or people -- from contact or by consuming the meat. However, the use of disposable gloves is always recommended for handling any wildlife carcass.

["Adenoviruses belong to a small group of viruses that can infect a variety of animals, both wild and domestic. Adenoviruses attack the blood vessels of affected animals. They have a broad range of hosts and cause a wide range of illnesses in humans and animals.

"Adenovirus hemorrhagic disease (AHD) is similar to other hemorrhagic diseases seen in deer including bluetongue and epizootic hemorrhagic disease. _Odocoileus_ adenovirus (OdAdV) infects ungulates like white-tailed and black-tailed deer, moose, and elk with mule deer being severely affected. Fawns are more susceptible to AHD and experience much higher mortality than adults.

"Adenovirus manifests in acute and chronic forms. Clinical signs of the acute form include rapid or open mouth breathing, foaming or drooling at the mouth, bloody diarrhea, and weakness. Neurologic signs such as seizures can occur. Animals may be found dead with no apparent cause. This disease course is often rapid and fatal.

"Adenovirus transmission can be through direct contact between deer and contact with bodily fluids like saliva, feces, or urine. Spread through airborne routes, contaminated water, and contaminated equipment may also occur. High-density deer populations could have a higher risk for the disease due to the ease of transmission.

"AHD is diagnosed at necropsy with gross findings, histopathology with adenovirus inclusion bodies, and finally PCR from lesions.

"There is no treatment or vaccine for adenovirus hemorrhagic disease."
