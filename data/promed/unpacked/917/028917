South African health authorities have reported a human case of rabies in an 8-year-old boy living near Ficksburg in Free State province. He was bitten on his thigh on 2 May 2015 by a dog. A few weeks later, he was admitted to hospital with symptoms of rabies infection and died on 6 Jul 2015.

Since the beginning of the year [2015], 5 cases of human infection with the rabies virus have been reported in South Africa: Limpopo (2 cases), KwaZulu-Natal (1 case), Eastern Cape (1 case) and Free State (1 case). A suspected case has been reported in the Eastern Cape Province. The diagnosis is pending confirmation.

Rabies is fatal if not treated in time. The preventive treatment of human rabies is very effective if administered promptly after contact with the carrier animal. Infection of humans is exclusively by animal contact: saliva by bites, scratches, licks on skin or excoriated mucosa (mouth).

The animal can become contagious 15 days before the 1st symptoms of the disease and remains infected until it dies. If the animal is alive and does not have any symptoms after an observation period of 15 days from the date of exposure (bite or other exposure), it [is not rabid], and, therefore, could not transmit rabies to the bitten person.

To reduce the risk of rabies, you should avoid contact with pets [you don't know], bats, or with wild mammals.

If bitten, do not scratch or lick a wound. Clean the wound with water and soap for 15 minutes and rinse; application of chlorine or iodine antiseptic are indispensable to limit the risk of infection.

It is most important to consult a doctor, who will decide on the need for rabies vaccine treatment and administration of rabies-specific immune globulin in the absence of preventive vaccination.

Preventive vaccination may be recommended for expatriates and Travelers at Risk (hikers, children, cyclists, cavers, people having contact with animals). Preventive vaccination provides no cure but should be implemented as soon as possible in case of known or suspected exposure, but it simplifies treatment, and immunoglobulins are not always available in developing countries.

Being bitten by a patently rabid dog is fairly clear, especially if the bitten person knows the dog. The problem is when it is a strange dog. Angry and/or threatened healthy dogs are known to bite, especially invaders or when the dog is uncertain and off its own territory. But dog bites must be taken seriously just in case, as described in this text, which is why veterinarians, folk by definition likely to be bitten, make sure to keep their rabies shots up to date just in case. - Mod.MHJ
