Update on heroin injecting anthrax cases
----------------------------------------
Investigations into the presence of anthrax in infections sustained by drug
injecting heroin users in Glasgow are ongoing.

At this afternoon's meeting of the outbreak control team (OCT) it was
confirmed that public health specialists and other health care
professionals across the country are continuing to review recent cases of
injecting drug users who presented with soft tissue infections or other
conditions. So far no new potential cases have been found.

Dr Syed Ahmed, consultant in public health medicine, said: "Drug injecting
is extremely risky and dangerous. The health service deals continually with
people who have suffered very serious infections due to dirty needles or
contaminated drugs. The possible presence of a batch of heroin contaminated
with anthrax makes drug injecting even riskier and even more dangerous.
Once again, I urge injecting drug users to be on their guard and to seek
urgent medical advice if they have experienced an infection or other
serious symptoms."

The OCT was also told that the female patient confirmed with the presence
of anthrax and undergoing treatment at the Victoria Infirmary remained
stable. The male patient undergoing intensive care at Glasgow Royal
Infirmary also remains stable.

The postmortem results on the man who died at the Victoria Infirmary on 16
Dec 2009 are expected next week.

No new "cases" in anthrax scare
-------------------------------
Health officials have said that no new cases of anthrax have emerged 48
hours after 2 heroin users in Glasgow tested positive for the infection.
NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said officials across the country were still
looking out for possible new cases.

A man and woman in the city's Victoria Infirmary tested positive for
anthrax. The man died on Wednesday [16 Dec 2009]. Doctors are waiting for
the results of tests carried out on a 3rd drug user at Glasgow Royal
Infirmary. At the moment, the cases are not being linked, though it is
known all 3 had infections in areas of the body they had injected with heroin.

Police and health officials are investigating whether contaminated heroin
or a contaminated cutting agent may be responsible.

Speaking after a meeting of the outbreak control team on Friday [18 Dec
2009], Dr Syed Ahmed, consultant in public health medicine, said: "The
possible presence of a batch of heroin contaminated with anthrax makes drug
injecting even riskier and even more dangerous. Once again, I urge
injecting drug users to be on their guard and to seek urgent medical advice
if they have experienced an infection or other serious symptoms."

The outbreak control team was told that the female patient with anthrax
remained in a stable condition at the Victoria Infirmary. The male patient
undergoing intensive care at Glasgow Royal Infirmary also remains in a
stable condition. The postmortem examination results on the man who died at
the Victoria Infirmary are expected next week.

Health authorities in the Highlands have said they have no reason to
believe there is any link with the deaths of 2 men in Inverness from
suspected drug use earlier this week.

Meanwhile, rehabilitation charity Turning Point Scotland has urged heroin
users to make use of help services. The charity's Ian Irvine said all
support agencies could do in a situations like this was to promote harm
reduction measures.

[At this time the UK authorities are limiting their comments to these 3
individuals -- the one death and the 2 hospitalized, all laboratory
confirmed. A thorough investigation is in hand as well as revisiting the
events in Oslo in 2000 to see if findings then can shed any light on
explaining these cases in 2009. An interesting report in the New Scientist
by Deb Mackenzie may fill in some memory gaps of a parallel fuss and flap
in the UK after the Oslo event:
<http://www.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/2009/12/anthrax-in-heroin-leads-to-dea.html>.

Infections in heroin users with various clostridia, skin pathogens, and
MRSA are not uncommon. Probably they reflect a lack of personal hygiene and
the reuse of needles, but this still leaves open how these users were
exposed to _Bacillus anthracis_ spores. - Mod.MHJ
