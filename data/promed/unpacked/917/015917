Epidemiological comments: an intensive surveillance system is in place for avian influenza virus including screening at Mai Po Nature Reserve in Hong Kong. Among the environmental samples collected by the University of Hong Kong on [9 Nov 2022], a sample of wild bird fecal droppings has been confirmed to be positive for H5N1. The organization managing the reserve has stepped up cleansing and disinfection of visitor facilities. The government is closely monitoring the situation of the birds in the reserve. There are no poultry farms within three kilometers of the reserve. The government has recently strengthened AI surveillance and closely monitored the situation of the local poultry farms and wholesale market. Poultry farmers, pet bird shop owners, and license holders of pet poultry and racing pigeons are reminded from time to time to ensure that proper precautions against avian influenza have been implemented.

["Migratory wild birds, especially waterfowl, are the natural host and reservoir of avian influenza viruses. They can carry different avian influenza virus strains within their respiratory or intestinal tracts.

"In birds, AI viruses are shed in the feces and respiratory secretions. They can all be spread through direct contact with secretions from infected birds, especially through feces or through contaminated feed and water. Because of the resistant nature of AI viruses, including their ability to survive for long periods when temperatures are low, they can also be carried on farm equipment and spread easily from farm to farm."
