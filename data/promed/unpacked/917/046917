A 45-year-old woman succumbed to rabies at the civic-run Naidu Infectious Diseases Hospital on Friday [20 Jun 2014], taking the fatal infection's death toll in the city to 15 this year [2014].

Civic officials said the woman was bitten by a dog one-and-a-half months ago and had not taken anti-rabies vaccines on the scheduled days. The deceased was a resident of Priyadarshininagar in old Sangvi. "She was admitted to Naidu Hospital when her health condition deteriorated," said S T Pardeshi, medical officer of health (MoH), Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). She developed mild fever and breathlessness before she was admitted to Naidu Hospital at 1 am on 20 Jun 2014. "She had developed symptoms of rabies like hydrophobia (fear of water), aerophobia (fear of air), and fear of light and was extremely breathless at the time of admission. She succumbed to the rabies infection at 11.55 pm on 20 Jun 2014," a doctor said.

"It was a category-III dog bite wound [category III is defined as: "single or multiple transdermal bites or scratches, contamination of mucous membrane with saliva from licks; exposure to bat bites or scratches" http://www.who.int/rabies/human/postexp/en/ - Mod.MPP]. As per the medical history produced by the victim's relatives, she had not taken the anti-rabies vaccination on the scheduled days. She was not administered rabies immunoglobulin, a readymade antibody which is extremely effective in deactivating the virus in category III dog-bite injury," the doctor added.

Patients are usually injected with a fast-acting ready made antibody, rabies immunoglobulin (RI), near the wound to deactivate the rabies virus. The ready made antibodies are given for immediate protection because the vaccine generally takes 14 days to produce antibodies. As per the World Health Organization, the incubation period for the infection is typically 1-3 months, but may vary from one week to one year. WHO guidelines advise that rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) should be given for all category III exposures, irrespective of the interval between exposure and beginning of treatment.

The sooner an effective canine vaccination programme can be initiated, the sooner we will see the end of these unnecessary and tragic human cases. - Mod.MHJ
