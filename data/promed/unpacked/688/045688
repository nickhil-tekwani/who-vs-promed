Maine State health officials have confirmed a large raccoon captured in a
trailer park was rabid, the first confirmed rabies case in the Bangor in at
least 20 years.
The raccoon, described by animal control officers as "disoriented and
stumbling," was discovered Monday morning. City Animal Control Officer Pat
Pinkham netted the raccoon after a maintenance worker trapped it under a
recycling bin.
There have been 8 cases reported so far this year in Penobscot County and
officials expect the number will continue to grow. There have been 136
confirmed rabies cases in the state this year.

[Raccoon rabies is not unusual in certain areas. However, it would behoove
public officials to start or accelerate a public awareness program as well
as encourage vaccination of pets. - Mod.TG
