USA: Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease Outbreak in Cincinnati
---------------------------------------------------
Hand, foot and mouth disease has doctors telling parents to keep their
children at home, WLWT Eyewitness News 5's Lisa Cooney reported on Mon 23
May 2004. The outbreak is the most common cause of mouth sores that are
often so painful that children won't want to eat. Consequently, they can
become dehydrated. Parents should look for bumps, some even blister-like,
on the palms of the hands, or on top or between the fingers, Cooney
reported. Such bumps or blisters also can pop up on the tops of the feet.
And mouth sores can show up on the gums, tongue and throat.
Summit Pediatrics spokeswoman Dr. Robin Warner said on Monday that they've
seen many children and taken numerous calls lately. She added that hand,
foot and mouth disease is a seasonal illness that usually spreads in
children 6 months to 4 years old. It's also highly contagious, and moves
through day-care groups quickly, Cooney reported.
"The fever is usually low-grade, and will last a few days, anywhere from
100 to 102 degrees," she said. A children's fever reducer and pain reliever
will help. And when the fever's gone, children can go back to day-care or
school. But the mouth sores may need more attention, Cooney reported.
"What we usually recommend is a little antacid like Maalox or Mylanta in
the mouth," Warner said. "On the younger (patients), you can get an oral
sponge and kind of swish it around on the blisters."
The disease is difficult to prevent because the virus is airborne. Parents
should encourage plenty of cool liquids.

[Hand, foot and mouth disease occurs globally. In developed countries hand,
foot and mouth disease is generally mild and often associated with
outbreaks of Coxsackie A virus infection. In East Asian countries in recent
years, the disease has been associated with outbreaks of enterovirus 71
infection and can be more severe, with a small proportion of children
experiencing neurological complications, occasionally with fatal outcome.
Information on the etiology of the current outbreak in Ohio would be
welcomed. - Mod.CP]
