[1] Bat, human exposure - Arizona

A girl in Southeast Valley who was bitten by a rabid bat last weekend is receiving treatment [post exposure prophylaxis, PEP] and is expected to recover, public-health officials said Friday [9 Nov 2012]. The child has been released from a hospital and is undergoing repeated injections of a rabies vaccine [PEP] and immunoglobulin, according to authorities.

This is the 1st confirmed rabid animal in Maricopa County in 2012. Last year, there were 5 confirmed cases according to officials [This is confusing. Were there 5 animal rabies cases or 5 human exposures resulting in post exposure prophylaxis? - Mod.TG].

The most common animals to contract rabies in Arizona are bats, skunks and foxes, according to public health officials. Rabid animals typically show no fear of people or pets and might be active during the day even if they are nocturnal animals.

According to authorities, bats found on the ground, in a pool, or by a pet could be rabid and should be dealt with by an animal-control officer or the Health Department.

Health officials recommend that people avoid feeding and touching wild animals. They also suggest people vaccinate cats and dogs against rabies and avoid sleeping on the open ground while camping.

If somebody is bitten or scratched by any wild animal, they should report it immediately to animal control or a health official, according to authorities.

A fox has tested positive for rabies in Polk County after biting a man last week. Officials say the fox bit a man while he was working on a horse farm off John Smith Road in the Green Creek community.

The Polk County Sheriff's Office got the results from the state veterinarian Tuesday [6 Nov 2012] that the fox tested positive for rabies. This is the 3rd rabid animal found in Polk County this year [2012].

Two horses in the area of the rabid fox will be monitored for the next 6 months to ensure their health. No bite marks were found on the animals.

A rabies vaccination clinic has been scheduled on 17 Nov 2012 at the Green Creek Fire Department [presumably for dogs & cats? The man has presumably already been vaccinated. - Mod.JW].

A wild fox that attacked a Carlsbad resident and 5 dogs has tested positive for rabies.

Carlsbad police say a resident on the 2500 block of Legion Street heard his dog barking outside around 1:30 a.m. Friday [2 Nov 2012], and he went outside to investigate. That's when the fox came around a storage shed and bit the man from behind.

The fox was next seen on North Eighth Street, where it attacked a puppy and an adult dog.

A police officer shot the fox in the mouth, but it survived and ran away, returning to the 2700 block of Legion, where it made its next attack. Around 4 a.m., a resident heard his dogs barking, and upon going outside, found the fox had bitten one of his pets. The other dog had the fox cornered in its doghouse. The man shot and killed the fox, finally ending its dangerous rampage.

The attacks were the latest symptom of the rabies outbreak that has kept Eddy County in its grip. Officials with the New Mexico Department of Health may perform a study in Carlsbad next month to see why the outbreak is so severe.

Dr. Paul Ettestad, the State Public Health veterinarian, said that this area has seen 38 cases of rabies this year [2012] in 30 skunks, 2 raccoons, 4 foxes, and 2 dogs. And that doesn't count the latest incident with the fox.

"It's really important to get dogs and cats up to date with the rabies vaccine," said Ettestad. "They are the barrier between people and wildlife." And though that's the most important factor in defeating the rabies outbreak, Ettestad also said that feeding wild animals has been a problem in Carlsbad, and he discourages anyone from doing so.

[4] Whitetail deer - Minnesota
Date: 5 Nov 2012

When a deer was found nearly drowned in a Mower County pond a few weeks ago, experts thought it might have epizootic hemorrhagic disease, an infectious, sometimes fatal disease that they feared had come into Minnesota from Iowa or some other state.

Much to their surprise, the whitetail had rabies. It was the 1st known case of a whitetail deer with rabies in Minnesota, said Dr. Joni Scheftel, a Minnesota Public Health Department veterinarian.

While it's incredibly rare for a deer to have the disease, "all mammals can get rabies," she said. This one probably got it after being bitten by a rabid skunk. It was not a danger to humans, she said.

The person who reported the deer saw it near a pond and pulled it out. One of the signs of epizootic hemorrhagic disease is that deer seek water because they have a fever, said Dr. Michelle Carstensen, a Department of Natural Resources veterinarian. Another sign is they bleed from the mouth or anus.

The DNR conservation office who was sent to look at it had been alerted to the possibility that epizootic hemorrhagic disease might be coming into the state and went to investigate, Carstensen said. When the animal's brain was tested, it was found to have rabies.

While it's the 1st known case, "it could be that there were cases that went undetected," she said. The other animals, however, might die in the woods, and no one knows it, she said. A rabid animal appears disoriented, acts strangely, and its hind legs become paralyzed.

Having a deer get rabies "is a really good lesson to everyone to vaccinate your dogs and cats for rabies," Scheftel said. They, along with horses [and other livestock - Mod.TG], can get rabies.

Hunters should be reminded to never eat any deer that appears sick. It's just a common safety warning and isn't related to the rabies case, she said.

If hunters see an animal they suspect is sick, it's best to contact a conservation officer, Carstensen said. The officer will decide what to do and could allow the hunter to shoot the animal if it's seen again, she said.

Hunters should also wear gloves when field dressing deer and wash their hands afterward, Scheftel said. Rabies is not found in meat, so it's not a food-safety issue, she said. But there are bugs [microbes] and other things that could be in the entrails of deer that can cause problems for humans, she said.

[Each of these areas should be scheduling a rabies clinic to insure that pets are vaccinated against rabies. Vaccinated pets often serve as the 1st line of defense against rabies. Pets also include horses and other farm animals. The show calves, goats, and sheep that are part family pet and part show animal are just as susceptible to rabies as other animals. It only takes one rabid bat or skunk to bite the horse or the show calf to expose the children and adults who work with these animals on a daily basis to rabies.

Even the town with the rabid whitetail deer should be considering a vaccination clinic. Having a report of a deer with rabies is unusual and indicates that the disease is in the area and that adequate precautions should be taken.

Human beings that are exposed to rabies need post-exposure prophylaxis. More information on post-exposure prophylaxis for rabies may be found on the CDC website at http://www.cdc.gov/rabies/medical_care/index.html.
