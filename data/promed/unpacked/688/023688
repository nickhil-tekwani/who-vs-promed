Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Mkhoqweni, Hhohho
Date of start of the outbreak: 2 Aug 2018
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: apiary
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Bees (hives) / 350 / 2 / 0 / 2 / 0
Affected population: The apiary had 2 hives located next to each other which were not performing well. The farm has its own honey processing plant and also buys unprocessed honey from other apiaries as well as import from other countries.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Bees (hives) / 0.57 / 0 / 0 / 0.57
* Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: Beetles suspected to be small hive beetles were observed in the 2 affected hives. Attempts are being made to confirm infestation and to inspect other apiaries that sell to the affected farm.

Control measures
Measures applied: official destruction of animals products; selective killing and disposal; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

["The small hive beetle, _Aethina tumida_ Murray 1867 (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae), is a parasite and predator of honey bees. Adults and larvae of small hive beetles feed on honey bee brood, honey and pollen. While feeding on food stores the remaining honey is fermenting and the comb is destroyed. The beetles can promote structural collapse of the nest and cause the adult honey bees to abscond from severely infested colonies. The extent of beetle-associated damage depends on climate, colony strength and other conditions. Small hive beetles tend to be more problematic in areas with warm temperatures and high humidity. The small hive beetle can be a serious problem in honey-extracting facilities where stored comb, honey and wax cappings are potential feeding and breeding areas. Beetle development from egg to adult requires 3-12 weeks, depending on humidity, temperature and food availability. The flying adult beetles actively infest honey bee colonies of all strengths and sizes.

"An infestation by the small hive beetle can be recognised either indirectly via colony-wide damage associated with the beetle or directly via eggs, larvae and adults. An early diagnosis can be made after opening the colony and finding adult beetles under the colony lid, on the bottom board, or hiding in the combs (especially peripheral combs). Definitive diagnosis at the laboratory is based on morphological examination under a stereomicroscope. Confirmatory testing can be done by real-time polymerase chain reaction.

"Serological tests are not applicable.

"No vaccines are available". http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.02.05_SMALL_HIVE_BEETLE.pdf. - Mod.CRD
