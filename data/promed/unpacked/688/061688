Vietnamese man dies from bird flu [49th fatality]
-------------------------------------------------
Viet Nam's Health Ministry confirmed that a 40-year-old man from
northern Hai Duong province died on Tue 13 Feb 2006 after 4 days of
treatment in Hanoi, local newspaper Young People reported Thursday [14
Feb 2008]. The man slaughtered [sic: presumably means prepared -
Mod.JW] 2 dead chickens for a meal before exhibiting bird flu symptoms
early this month [February 2008]. He was admitted to the city-based
Tropical Diseases Hospital on 8 Feb 2008 when his lung and kidneys
were damaged. Some chickens have died around his house over the past
few weeks, the newspaper said.

Late last month [January 2008] the Ministry confirmed that a
32-year-old ethnic man from northern Tuyen Quang died from bird flu on
18 Jan 2008. His specimens tested positive to bird flu virus strain
H5N1. He slaughtered [sic: see above] and ate dead fowls. After
detecting no human cases of bird flu infections for nearly 4 months,
the Ministry confirmed that a 4-year-old boy from northern Son La
province died from bird flu on 16 Dec 2007.

Viet Nam has confirmed a total of 103 human cases of bird flu
infections, including 49 fatalities, since the disease started to hit
the country in December 2003.

Viet Nam currently has 2 localities with poultry [affected by] bird
flu: northern Thai Nguyen and central Quang Binh province, according
to the Department of Animal Health under the country's Ministry of
Agriculture and Rural Development. Bird flu outbreaks in Viet Nam,
starting in December 2003, have killed and led to the forced culling
of dozens of millions of fowls in the country, the department said.

Bird flu kills 2nd Vietnamese this year [2008]
----------------------------------------------
Bird flu has killed a 40-year-old Vietnamese man who might have been
infected after eating sick chickens, state-run media said on Thursday
[14 Feb 2008]. His death is the 2nd in Viet Nam from avian influenza
this year. The man died in a Hanoi hospital on Wednesday [13 Feb
2008], 4 days after being treated for lung and kidney failure, the
Liberation Saigon newspaper quoted the hospital's deputy director,
Nguyen Hong Ha, as saying. The Health Ministry reported that tests
confirmed the man from the northern province of Hai Duong, 50 km (31
mi) southeast of Hanoi, had the H5N1 virus. It brought to 49 the
country's toll from bird flu.

Health officials have been monitoring the man's relatives since last
week after he and his family ate 2 chickens that had died from
unknown causes. Dead chickens have also been reported in the
neighbourhood.

Last month [January 2008], bird flu killed a 32-year-old man from an
ethnic minority group in the northern province of Tuyen Quang.

[Viet Nam had achieved considerable success in controlling avian
influenza in humans and poultry, but since the turn of the year there
has been some slippage. The death of the most recent case (when
confirmed by WHO) will bring the death toll to 49 and the case total
to 103.

The northern province named variously as Tuyen Quang or Hai Duong as
the residence of the latest fatality is not one of the 2 provinces
(Thai Nguyen and Quang Binh) currently affected by avian influenza in
poultry.
