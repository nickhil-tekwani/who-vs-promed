West Nile fever in Camargue - Update
-------------------------------------
The Camargue region in the south of France is suffering from an outbreak of
West Nile fever - the first time the disease has affected this part of the
Mediterranean in 40 years. So far only horses have been struck by the
disease, but public health experts are worried that it could spread to
humans too. So many horses have died and been infected that the public
health authorities have been forced to introduce emergency measures. West
Nile virus causes paralysis in horses. Infected animals may not even be
able to shake their heads to get rid of flies. Horses that survive
infection have to be slowly taught how to walk again. The herds of
free-ranging horses, characteristic of this region, are now being rounded
up to contain spread of the disease [and assist rehabilitation of recovered
animals.
The disease has been brought to the Camargue by migratory birds, [and
spread by mosquitoes. The result has been devastating. With global
warming, the expectation is that the disease will be more frequent, and the
worry for the health authorities is that it could soon affect humans as
well as horses. Professor Herve Zeller of the Pasteur Institute, Paris, is
quoted as saying that this is a threat that is being taken very seriously
indeed. The virus can produce some disease in humans, producing most often
a flu-like illness, a very mild form of disease. But in a very few cases
there can be neurologically [severe consequences of infection. It is hoped
a cold winter will kill off the mosquitoes. In the meantime the swamps and
lagoons are being sprayed. The fear, though, is that this is a problem that
will be back next year.
