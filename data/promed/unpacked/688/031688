We recently reviewed the literature regarding neurological complications of
chlamydial infections (Korman TM, Turnidge JD, Grayson ML. Clin Infect Dis
1997;25:847-851).

_Chlamydia pneumoniae_
Reports of neurological complications of _Chlamydia pneumoniae_ include 3
cases of meningitis or meningoencephalitis, and cases of Guillain-Barre
syndrome, lumbosacral meningoradiculitis and cerebellar ataxia, mostly
following respiratory tract infections. All were diagnosed on the basis of
species-specific serology using the micro immunofluorescence (MIF) test.
Studies from Finland have more recently identified serological evidence of
current _C. pneumoniae_ infection in patients with central nervous system
infections. (Koskiniemi M, et al. Eur Neurol. 1996; 36(3): 160-163;
Koskiniemi M, et al. Eur J Pediatr. 1997;156: 541-545).

_Chlamydia psittaci_
A range of neurological sequelae have been attributed to _Chlamydia
psittaci_. In his classic 1880 report, Ritter observed the "very strong
effect on the nervous system" associated with a disease he labelled
"pneumotyphus", which we now recognise as psittacosis. Of over 20 reports
of neurological complications of _C. psittaci_, twelve had clinical
features of encephalitis. Cranial nerve palsies reported, mostly
accompanying encephalitis, involved cranial nerves II, IV, VI, VII and XII.
There are also reports of transverse myelitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome and
cerebellar ataxia. Diagnosis was made by the _Chlamydia_ genus-specific
complement fixation test in most cases. However, infections with _C.
pneumoniae_ are more common than psittacosis, and many infections
previously diagnosed as psittacosis on the basis of CF testing have proven
to be due to _C. pneumoniae_ after MIF testing. Previous reports of
neurological complications attributed to _C. psittaci_ based on CF tests,
in particular those cases without documented bird contact, may have
actually been due to _C. pneumoniae._

_Chlamydia trachomatis_
_Chlamydia trachomatis_, which causes ocular trachoma, genitourinary tract
and neonatal infections and lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) has also been
associated with meningoencephalitis. Early experimental intracerebral
inoculation of the "LGV virus" in animals demonstrated meningoencephalitis.
The agent was later isolated from CSF during acute human LGV infection,
with no clinical meningoencephalitis and normal CSF studies. Four cases of
meningoencephalitis associated with LGV were reported over 50 years ago and
at least 2 cases associated with non-LGV serotypes have been diagnosed by
MIF testing.
