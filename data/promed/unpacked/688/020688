MYCOBACTERIAL KERATITIS (2)
===========================
[Replying to "Mycobacterial keratitis: RFI", reporting a
human case of ophthalmic infection apparently due to M. chelonei]
There was a case of Mycobacterium chelonei in a young woman
who underwent a lung transplant recently for cystic fibrosis at
Pittsburgh. I understood from second hand sources that
the infection was in the incision or wound. When I asked if
there was a reptile lurking somewhere in the background
I received no further correspondence (e-mail) on the case.
Are there any reptiles (e.g. turtles, lizards) lurking in
the background on this case?
According to Rosenthal and Mader (in Reptile Medicine
and Surgery, p. 123. WB Saunders, 1996) M. chelonei is
often isolated from reptiles. In fact it appears to be
named after the Order Chelonia (Turtles & Tortoises).
Although it may have other etymology in latin ...
"arms of Scorpio." A case published in 1992
involved a patient who was misdiagnosed with Nocardia.
After her death it was discovered the offending organism
was M. chelonei. (Paul et al: 1992. J. Clin. Pathol.
45(6):528-30.
