Pig farmers were accused yesterday of risking a nationwide epidemic of
classical swine fever by smuggling their stock out of affected areas before
government restrictions can be imposed. Many producers fear it will spread
the disease outside East Anglia....[cut, snip -Mod. PC] Nick Brown, the
Agriculture Minister, is seeking new legal powers to halt the smuggling.
Pig farmers are being alerted to new outbreaks by the grapevine in farming
communities and are secretly transporting their animals to slaughter or to
farms away from potential surveillance zones. This movement of animals is
not illegal if the Ministry of Agriculture has not actually served a
restriction order on a particular area. Industry leaders have appealed to
farmers to be "sensible" but many face bankruptcy because of what they
consider to be poor compensation from the Government.
One producer, who wanted to remain anonymous, confirmed that he had already
moved 1 500 pigs and was prepared to move more. He said: "What is happening
is that the work of vets in controlling this disease is being undermined by
farmers who are doing everything to prevent themselves going bankrupt. The
situation is going to get out of control unless producers are paid proper
compensation."
--
[Yes, good compensation is a key to any animal disease control program. But
as Ministries of Agriculture in various places lose political clout, coming
up with pounds, pesos, francs or dollars to meet producer expectations
(inflated or not) of good compensation can become a Herculean task. Of
course, in an epidemic governments can pay now or pay more later. For those
concerned with why diseases emerge or reemerge, the lack of political will
to fund programs may be as serious a threat as a pathogen's genetics.
Specifically, in the case of reemergence of animal diseases, a failure to
adequately fund "stamping out" programs may give the microbe the foothold
it needs to reemerge. Economics can trump the best laid plans of
veterinarians. The slighted partner in this scenario often is the producer
in the disease free area who becomes quarantined after the moved pigs break
with disease. She can blame both parties and then join the struggle. -Mod.PC]
