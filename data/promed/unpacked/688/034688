Yesterday [17 Jan 2007] 3 residents of Irkutsk died as a result of
alcohol contamination . More than 50 people are hospitalized. In 2
districts of Irkutsk an emergency regime has been announced. In
Sverdlovsk,for example, 20 people are hospitalized and one person has
died. For some reason all of those hospitalized are refusing to
reveal the place where they bought the surrogate alcohol. The total
number of people that have died as a result of alcohol contamination
has reached 350 in Ural and Privoljye regions. Also about 5000 people
have been [poisoned by contaminated alcohol] in that region

[Another wave of alcohol contamination is rising. Currently, new
politics are being discussed in Russia concerning alcohol poisonings,
and hopefully the policy will help prevent these cases. It includes
introduction of a state monopoly on alcohol, healthy lifestyle
promotion, etc. We hope that political policies will indeed lead to
positive changes. - Mod.NR/TG]
[It is not clear to this observer how a state monopoly would reduce
the amount of illegal moonshine produced, since the latter will
inevitably be cheaper than state prices. - Mod.JW]
