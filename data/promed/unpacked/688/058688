[As mentioned in the immediate notification report, there are other suspect cases in other regions of the country.

According to what is published in the media, http://www.diarioaysen.cl/sitio/2018/01/23/detectan-brote-de-influenza-equina-en-actividad-de-rodeo-en-chile-chico/ (article in Spanish): "an outbreak was detected in the location of Chile Chico - Aysen Region (this area is about 2000 km [approx. 1240 mi] from the Metropolitan Region - Santiago). The occurrence of the disease was verified by SAG Personnel from the Chile Chico office on [Sat 20 Jan 2018] during a local rodeo event that also coincided with a notification provided by a private practitioner of that sector."

Equine Influenza (EI) is a reportable disease to the Agriculture and Livestock Services (SAG) as well as a disease which is notifiable by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). In Chile the disease occurs sporadically, with outbreaks occurring in 2006 and 2012, as a consequence of vaccine programs that were discontinued in equines.

Currently, EI has been confirmed in the Metropolitan Region (Santiago), and cases fitting the clinical picture have been reported in Valparaiso (186 km or 115 mi from Santiago) and in O'Higgins (141 km or 88 mi from Santiago).

"Equine influenza is an acute respiratory infection of horses, donkeys, mules and zebras caused by 2 distinct subtypes (H7N7, formerly equi-1, and H3N8, formerly equi2) of influenza A virus within the genus Influenzavirus A of the family Orthomyxoviridae. Viruses of the H7N7 subtype have not been isolated since the late 1970s. Equine influenza viruses of both subtypes are considered to be of avian ancestry and highly pathogenic avian H5N1 has been associated with an outbreak of respiratory disease in donkeys in Egypt. In fully susceptible equidae, clinical signs include pyrexia and a harsh dry cough followed by a mucopurulent nasal discharge. In partially immune vaccinated animals, one or more of these signs may be absent. Vaccinated infected horses can still shed the virus and serve as a source of virus to their cohorts.

"Characteristically, influenza spreads rapidly in a susceptible population. The disease is endemic in many countries with substantial equine populations. In recent years, infection has been introduced into Australia and re-introduced into South Africa and Japan; to date New Zealand and Iceland are reported to be free of equine influenza virus.

"While normally confined to equidae, equine H3N8 influenza has crossed the species barrier to dogs. Extensive infection of dogs has been reported in North America where it normally produces mild fever and coughing but can cause fatal pneumonia. While equine influenza has not been shown to cause disease in humans, serological evidence of infection has been described primarily in individuals with an occupational exposure to the virus. During 2004-2006 influenza surveillance in central China (People's Rep. of) 2 equine H3N8 influenza viruses were also isolated from pigs."
