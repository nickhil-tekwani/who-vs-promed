Yellow Fever Vaccination Required For Travel to and from Easter Island
----------------------------------------------------------------------
On 18 October 2002, the Government of Chile declared obligatory
vaccination against yellow fever for all persons from areas where the
disease is endemic. The same document (Decree No. 291) declares
yellow fever vaccination obligatory for all persons returning from or
traveling by any means to Easter Island. This administrative
resolution was taken because of the presence of _Aedes aegypti_ in
the island, and it went into effect on 8 November 2002. There have
been no cases of yellow fever reported in Easter Island but there
have been cases of dengue fever, with the Aedes mosquito being the
vector.

[Easter Island is located in the Pacific Ocean 3800 km off the coast
of Chile. There has been no confirmed case of yellow fever on the
Island up to the present; the order is intended to prevent the
introduction of the virus into the Island. The risk factor is the
presence on Easter Island of the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_, a vector
of both dengue fever virus and yellow fever virus. The presence of
_Aedes aegypti_ on the Island has been known for more than 2 years.
In March 2002 the first indication of the occurrence of dengue fever
virus on the Island was diagnosis of dengue fever in a patient
recently arrived in Chile from Easter Island (the _Aedes aegypti_
mosquito was absent from mainland Chile at that time). Subsequently
other cases of dengue fever have been diagnosed on the Island, and
attempts to eradicate the mosquito vector have not yet succeeded. -

[Since the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito can transmit both dengue and
yellow fever viruses, any country or territory harboring the mosquito
is at risk for both diseases. Therefore it is a sensible precaution
to require yellow fever vaccination in this case. However, given the
low risk of reimportation of _Aedes aegypti_ to Easter Island, it
would be safer, and should be feasible, to eradicate the mosquito
from Easter Island. If anyone has data to suggest that the risk of
reimportation is significant, I would like to receive it. - Mod.JW]
