Citrus blight (CB), causing a chronic decline of citrus, has been an
important disease in Florida for over 100 years. CB was 1st reported in
Brazil in the 1980s and is now responsible for the removal of nearly 10 per
cent of the trees from production annually. No causal agent has been
identified, but CB has been root-graft transmitted to healthy trees,
suggesting that the causal agent is infectious (1).
Since 1997, CB symptoms were observed in several groves in northern Costa
Rica, the most important citrus area of about 25 000 ha. Symptoms observed
include a general decline and wilt of the tree canopy, off-color leaves,
leaf drop, twig dieback, small fruit, delayed blossom, poor growth, and
death. A survey near Guanacaste revealed CB symptoms in 7 year old Valencia
and Pineapple orange trees (_Citrus sinensis_ (L.) Osbeck) grafted on
Carrizo citrange (_C. sinensis_ (L.) Osbeck x _Poncirus trifoliata_ (L.)
Raf.) rootstock.
Since 1997, 6 per cent of the trees in this area have been replanted
annually because of CB symptoms. Similar situations were observed in other
groves in the northern citrus area. Dot immunobinding assays (DIBA) (2)
were used to detect the P12 protein associated with CB, with 20 of 22 trees
showing CB-like symptoms giving a positive test.
Zinc (Zn) accumulation in trunk wood and water uptake tests were done
according to Roistacher (3) in 8 healthy and 20 symptomatic trees that were
positive for CB using DIBA. The average Zn concentration of 16 declining
trees was 4.6 � 1.9, whereas the average concentration for 8 healthy trees
was 2.0 � 0.9. The average water uptake in one minute was 14 ml for healthy
trees, and virtually zero for the 20 symptomatic trees.
These diagnostic tests confirm the presence of CB in the northern citrus
area of Costa Rica, and the surveys indicate the disease is beginning to
spread and become economically important.
To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of CB in commercial citrus in
Costa Rica.

[The etiology of Citrus blight [CB] remains unknown. First detected in
Brazil in 1977 in Sao Paulo State, it was later detected in other states
and is now found in all production areas of the country. Similar diseases
have been described in other parts of the world, but their etiologies
remain unknown. CB is the main cause of low longevity of orchard groves,
accounting for 5 per cent of tree deaths annually. The high mortality rate
is due to the use of Rangpur lime (highly susceptible to the disease),
because that rootstock is used in more than 90 per cent of the groves. Some
pathologists suggest that CB is an abiotic disease (that is, nutritional
and pH-related issues), while others think it is a biotic disease (that is,
some fastidious organism or virus-like agent). Several nutritional and
pH-related studies are under way to examine abiotic factors. Efforts are
underway to search for and characterize any organisms associated with the
CB syndrome. Host genes that relate to CB-induced proteins are being
examined to help determine the cause. USDA/ARS scientists at Ft Pierce, FL
are examining nutrition issues and genetics, and University of Florida
researchers are examining molecular biology and virus-like organisms. CB is
one of the most serious economic problems for citrus growers in Florida and
Brazil. Millions of trees are lost annually, and yearly losses are pegged
at 4 to 7 per cent in affected groves. In Florida, about 500 000 citrus
trees are removed annually.
