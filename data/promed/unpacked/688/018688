The Department of Health of Hortolandia [in the state of Sao Paulo]
confirmed on Tuesday (27 Jul 2010) the death of a 14-year-old caused
by spotted fever disease transmitted by the star tick. The teenager,
who died in late June 2010, was admitted to a hospital in Campinas,
but lived in Hortolandia.

[Actually, there are no effective ways to control the disease.
Brazilian spotted fever is a focal disease in the wild (but also
rural and peri-urban), with vectors very difficult to control. The
cleansing of peri-urban land, control of animals such as horses and
cattle, as well as the containment of capybaras (capybaras and humans
must maintain a certain distance) are measures that reduce, but not
eliminate, risk.

The period from late autumn to early spring is dry in the Brazilian
Southeast and coincides with the proliferation of ticks - Mod.LJS]

[Brazilian spotted fever is known in Portuguese as "febre maculosa
brasileira". The disease is quite similar to Rocky Mountain spotted
fever, with only subtle differences. The etiological agent,
_Rickettsia ricketsii_, is considered almost identical to its
American counterpart.

The disease was first described in 1929 but underwent a
still-unexplained disappearance in the 1960s and 1970s. Since 1985,
it has been found with increasing frequency in Sao Paulo and Minas
Gerais states, but cases have been seen in Rio de Janeiro and
Espirito Santo states. Cases have also been identified in the state
of Santa Catarina in the south. The main vector tick is _Amblyomma
cajennense_, but _A. cooperii_ has been also implicated. - Mod.LL]
