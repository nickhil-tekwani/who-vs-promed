Regarding the claim in the previous posting (reference below) that:
<< Vaccinated people can transmit vaccinia virus >>
An interesting historical note is that during the early days of vaccination
(while Jenner was still alive), the problem of keeping live stocks of the
vaccine was solved by transferring the vaccine from one recipient to the
next. As explained by Jonathan B. Tucker in his book "Scourge: The Once
and Future threat of Smallpox" (New York: Atlantic Monthly Press, 2001), p. 29:
"One solution to the problem was to keep the vaccine 'alive' by
transferring it from one human recipient to the next, a practice known as
the arm-to-arm technique. First, an individual was vaccinated, and as soon
as the cowpox pustule had appeared on his or her arm, matter from the
lesion was then used to vaccinate other recipients. In 1801 in St.
Petersburg, Russia, for example, a recently vaccinated girl was sent to a
local orphanage to serve as the source of smallpox vaccine for all children
more than a week old. From then on, the orphanage continuously transferred
the vaccine from one child to another for more than ninety-two years
(1801-93)."
The author goes on to note the hazards of the arm-to-arm method: It could
"contaminate the vaccine with dangerous pathogens, resulting in inadvertent
spread of hepatitis or syphilis. In 1861, for example, 41 Italian children
who had been vaccinated by arm-to-arm transfer acquired syphilis from a
child with an undiagnosed case of the disease." (p. 33)

information that other diseases could also be transmitted through
arm-to-arm transfer of the vaccine. - Mod.MPP]
