A hepatitis A outbreak in the San Diego area has claimed the life of a 5th person, county health officials reported on [Wed 12 Jul 2017].

The outbreak now totals 228 cases and required the hospitalization of 161 of those sickened, according to the county Health and Human Services Agency. So far, the disease has mostly affected the homeless population and/or users of illegal drugs, with 7 out of every 10 cases affecting those populations. One of every 5 people sickened with hepatitis A also has hepatitis C.

The county reported the 5th death exactly one month after the 4th death on 12 June 2017. In the month since, the county has learned of 68 new cases, with 41 additional hospitalizations. The 3rd death was reported 5 May 2017.

Public health investigators have not identified any common food, drink or drug source as a contributing cause to this outbreak, officials said. "It is imperative that anyone at risk for hepatitis A get vaccinated,'' said D. Wilma Wooten, the county's public health officer. ''We cannot stress this enough -- get vaccinated and make sure you wash your hands after going to the bathroom.''

"Lives are at risk,'' Wooten said. "Protect yourself, your family and the community.''

County health officials have been working with homeless services providers, community health clinics, faith-based organizations, substance abuse treatment providers, hospital emergency departments, jails and probation facilities to conduct vaccination clinics for people who are at risk of catching the illness. It can take up to nearly 2 months after exposure to develop symptoms, but the disease can be prevented if people get immunized within 2 weeks of exposure, the HHSA said.

The number of cases of diagnosed hepatitis A in San Diego County in southern California continues to increase, now over an almost 8 month period.

Date / Cases / Hospitalized (percentage) / Deaths (percentage)
5 Apr 2017 / 39 / 33 (85) / 1 (3)
4 May 2017 / 80 / 66 (83) / 3 (4)
31 May 2017 / 133 / 103 (80) / 3 (2)
12 Jun 2017 / 160 / 120 (75) / 4 (2.5)
27 Jun 2017 / 196 / 142 (72) / 4 (2)
05 Jul 2017 / 228 / 161 (71) / 5 (3)

Since many cases of HAV infection are asymptomatic or anicteric (without jaundice), the total number of cases is likely to have been significantly higher. It is not clear if the newer cases are truly new or just newly reported older cases. It remains unclear if the persistent increase is related to slow reporting, increased awareness and testing, secondary cases, or the persistent source or sources in the environment. The very high hospitalization rate may be related to the homelessness of the cohort but could represent a more virulent strain. HAV infection occurred in some individuals chronically infected with either hepatitis B or C, but it is not clear if the fatalities occurred in those individuals.

Homelessness and illicit substance use seem to be relevant risk factors while homosexual practices are not. It remains unclear how and from what vehicle the virus is spreading and if there is any relationship to the outbreak in eastern Michigan. - Mod.LL
