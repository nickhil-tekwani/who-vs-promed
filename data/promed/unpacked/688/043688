An epidemiological investigation in the Chaquihuan sector of the
municipality of Los Muermos is being carried out by teams from the
Health SEREMI [Regional Ministerial Secretariat] Los Lagos after its
epidemiological surveillance system reported the case of a
43-year-old who died with symptoms associated with hantavirus
cardiopulmonary syndrome [HPS].

The site visit was conducted to determine the environmental
conditions and risk factors that could be favorable for infections by
[a] hantavirus, both at the home and in the vicinity of the place
where the man was a farm worker. He died on Tue 4 Jan [2011] at the
Hospital de Puerto Montt.

The medical epidemiologist with the Health SEREMI, Jose Antonio
Vergara, explained that despite awaiting [laboratory] results from
the ISP [Public Health Institute], "this case may correspond to what
usually occurs in rural areas where activities are agriculture and
forestry, which by their very nature are high risk activities," said Vergara.

Note that the summer season increases the likelihood of human
exposure to the long-tailed mouse [long-tailed pygmy rice rat,
_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_] by either tourism or work activities.
That is why the recommendations to the public should be strengthened.
"We must be careful with the disposal of solid wastes and water to
encourage mice to stay away from homes; it is essential that people
be careful when opening buildings that have been closed for long
periods, such as summer cottages and countryside buildings. The most
dangerous hours of exposure for people are during the night, since
this is a nocturnal rodent," said Jose Antonio Vergara, medical epidemiologist.

[Los Muermos is within the ecosystem where Andes hantavirus is
endemic in its rodent host.

The New Mexico Department of Health announced today [6 Jan 2011] that
a 51-year-old man from McKinley County is hospitalized at UNM
Hospital in Albuquerque with the State's 1st diagnosed case of
hantavirus pulmonary syndrome this year [2011]. An environmental
investigation will be conducted to determine where the man may have
been exposed to the virus.

"All New Mexicans should be aware of this disease and take
precautions to avoid rodents and their droppings," said Dr. Paul
Ettestad, the Department of Health's public health veterinarian.
"This is especially important at this time of year when the cold
weather is causing rodents to seek shelter and food in homes and
other buildings. The best defense against [a] hantavirus [infection]
is to seal up your house so mice can't enter and avoid disturbing
areas of rodent infestation, including nests and droppings."

Hantavirus[es] [can cause] a deadly disease transmitted by infected
rodents through urine, droppings or saliva. People can contract the
disease [virus] when they breathe hantavirus particles.

The deer mouse [_Peromyscus maniculatus_] is the main reservoir for
[Sin Nombre] hantavirus in New Mexico.

[There was a case of HPS in this same county in May 2010 (see
ProMED-mail archive no. 20100509.1509]. It is unfortunate that this
and other reports refer to "hantavirus" as though there were just one
species that causes human infection and HPS. The hantavirus
responsible for this and the previous cases in the southwestern USA
is almost certain to be Sin Nombre virus.
