40 dead, 400 ill in Nanjing food poisoning outbreak
---------------------------
Up to 40 people have died after more than 400 people were poisoned by
tainted food in China's eastern city of Nanjing today.
The official People's Daily reports "more than 400 people were poisoned and
a lot of people died one after another as attempts to save them failed".
One local resident with close links to the area's hospitals says at least
30 people have been killed by the tainted food. "I was told that 30 people
had died by 4:00 this afternoon [local time]," the woman said.
"The exact cause of death is still unclear, police are investigating."
Later reports indicate the death toll may have risen to 40.
The fatalities began this morning in Nanjing's Tangshan township, after
locals ate fried bread and sesame cakes, ordinary Chinese breakfast fare.
Such items are normally available from street vendors.
Among the fatalities are students from the Zuoguang Middle School and from
the East Lake Lidao area.
"At present, all areas of work are progressing under urgent conditions
including the rescue, aftermath and the investigation," the People's Daily
said. "The illnesses of those poisoned have basically been controlled and
related matters are being investigated and dealt with."
Local officials refused to comment on the poisonings and would not confirm
or deny rumors circulating around the city that between 50 and 100 people
have succumbed to the tainted food.

[In the absence of information on the clinical pictures associated with
this reported episode, it is very difficult to postulate possible
etiologies, other than a suggestion of a possible toxic contamination given
an apparent short incubation period (the appearance of 40 deaths by 4 PM,
presumably within less than 12 hours of ingestion). More information on
this outbreak/incident would be very much appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
