2003/091 "Brittle leaf": new lethal disease of date palm: addition to the
EPPO Alert List
--------------------------------------------------------
The EPPO Secretariat has recently been informed by Dr Alrouechdi (FAO/SNEA,
Tunis) that an emerging disease called "brittle leaf disease" (maladie des
feuilles cassantes) was causing serious damage to date palms in Tunisia. It
was first described in 1986 in the oasis of Nefta (although similar
symptoms were already observed in the 1960s) and has now spread to almost
all oases south of Tunis. It has been found in Tozeur, Al-Hamma, Tamarza,
Gafsa, Kebili, and Gabes. Although the cause of the brittle leaf disease
remains unknown, the EPPO Secretariat decided to add it to the EPPO Alert
List because of its severity on an important crop such as date palm.
36 000 trees are now affected by brittle leaf disease, whose etiology is
unknown, and many other trees have already been killed and removed.
Similar symptoms have been observed in Algeria as well as Tunisia. Date
palms (_Phoenix dactylifera_) of most Tunisian varieties including Deglet
Nour, Tozer Zaid, Akhouat Alig, Ammaria, Besser, Kinta, as well as seedling
trees and pollinator trees have been affected. Kintichi seems to be
relatively tolerant. No data are available on other possible hosts, for
example on ornamental palms.
At the beginning, a few fronds are chlorotic with a dull, olive green
colour. Leaflets become brittle, twisted, frizzled, and shrivelled with a
scorched appearance. The most characteristic symptom is the ease with which
leaflets can be broken. Necrotic streaks develop on the pinnae. These
symptoms gradually extend to the nearby fronds until the whole tree is
affected, and dies. 4 to 6 years may elapse between first symptoms and
death of the tree. Symptoms occur on trees of all ages, including offshoots
and small seedlings.
The symptoms resemble those of manganese deficiency, but sprays or
injections of manganese do not solve the problem (at least there is a delay
in symptom expression), and mineral soil analysis could not reveal
differences between diseased and healthy plots. Patterns of diseased trees
observed in the field suggest a biotic origin, as affected trees seem to
cluster into foci. A small dsRNA has been found associated with symptomatic
trees but could not be related to a known pathogen.
The means of dissemination and its pathway is unknown. If pathogens (such
as viroids or phytoplamas) are involved, there may be a risk associated
with planting material.
Date palms are important crops around the Mediterranean basin, especially
in Maghreb countries. The disease has apparently the ability to kill a
large number of trees, and if a pathogen is involved efforts should be made
to prevent any further introductions and spread.

[The fact that no pathogen has been identified is not too surprising, given
that other priorities may be more urgent. Efforts will have to be directed
at finding the causal agent(s). Reference to a low molecular weight dsRNA
in affected date palm is of interest but there are dsRNAs in apparently
healthy crops (for example, black-seeded common bean) which seem to have no
apparent relation to disease expression. Presumably _F. oxysporum_ f. sp.
_albedinis_, the causal agent of Bayoud disease, _F. proliferatum_ and
_Erwinia chrysanthemi_ have been considered as possible pathogens. The date
palm is often the only available staple food for the inhabitants of desert
and arid lands, and thus it is vital to millions throughout North Africa
and the Middle East. According to FAO, there are 90 million date palms in
the world, each of which can grow for more than 100 years. 64 million of
these trees are grown in Arab countries, which produce 2 million tons of
dates between them each year. Trees start producing after 4-5 years and
reach full production after 10-12 years. Major Arabian date palm producers
include the Maghreb countries (Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia), Egypt, Libya
and Saudi Arabia. A useful reference:
