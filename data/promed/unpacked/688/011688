-----------------------------------------
In regard to the recent published study where 191 subjects were tested for the presence of MERS Ab [antibody] according to their reported exposure to camels, it is important to emphasize that probably the most feasible way to assess the strength of association between MERS cases and exposure to camels is through a matched case control study where each MERS case is matched to (and hence compared with) several controls, i.e. people who have not contracted the disease.

Using this approach, we can acquire an insight if indeed people who have contact with camels are more likely to get the disease than people who do not have this contact. In this regard, WHO and FAO have been calling affected countries in Middle East for launching case-control studies to identify how the virus gets into people. FAO has stressed the need for these case control studies on several occasions and gatherings on MERS-CoV. WHO from its side has put together a comprehensive guiding document for countries and investigators to compare MERS case-patients with other people who don't have MERS in order to identify factors of exposure to the virus, including contact with animals, especially camels. This document is being regularly revised and updated based on the knowledge accumulated. The last version of this document can be found on the WHO website (http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/MERSCoVCaseControlStudyofExposures28March2014.pdf?ua=1).

It would be useful for the international community if countries will share any relevant information on studies that have been conducted.

[WHO's protocol "Case-control study to assess potential risk factors related to human illness caused by Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV)," version 5 (published 28 Mar 2014), refers to primary cases only. It includes the following explanatory text:

"2.2 STUDY POPULATION
While there are many questions about the mode of transmission and risk factors for human-to-human transmission, the primary purpose of this study is to determine the non-human source of infection, such as exposures to animals or contaminated food products. Therefore, study subjects will include only primary cases, that is, sporadic cases with presumed non-human exposures that resulted in infection or index cases from clusters. These are cases that do not have a history of recent exposure to a confirmed or probable MERS-CoV infected case in the 14 days before onset of their illness to exclude cases for whom the transmission may have occurred through human-to-human transmission. Cases should include only those confirmed according to the current WHO case definitions. As many of the known cases have occurred as part of clusters in which human-to-human transmission is suspected to have occurred, it will be important to identify the index case in the cluster to include in the study. If there is uncertainty as to whether or not the case might have had significant exposure to another infected human in the 14 days before the case's illness, the case should not be enrolled as a study subject."

FAO's current call for action, echoing the pending need for elucidation of MERS-CoV's animal source of primary human infections, deserves full attention in the MERS-CoV affected countries. Some added detail on the selection mode of the controls and, if applicable, their minimal numbers may be useful. - Mod.AS]

[There have been calls for information on results of possible case control studies for quite some time now. It is unclear if any case control studies addressing possible routes of transmission have been conducted. While the majority of cases in recent times have involved person to person transmission in either the household, the healthcare or in the community, there are still sufficient numbers of "sporadic cases" that would permit a case control study to be conducted. In the most recent WHO update on MERS-CoV, 2 of the 5 cases had some possible contact with camels, and 2 others had no identifiable high risk exposures in the 14 days preceding onset of illness (see MERS-CoV (11): Saudi Arabia, new cases, deaths, WHO 20150121.3108145) ProMED-mail would be very interested to learn if there are actual case control studies underway that may help address the persistent enigma of how is the species jump from bat to human occurring. Is the camel an efficient intermediary host? Or is it being "blamed" unfairly? - Mod.MPP]
