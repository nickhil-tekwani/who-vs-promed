There are multiple mentions in the article [Streptococcus zooepidemicus - USA: (GA) dogs 20191005.6710725] about vaccination. What vaccine are they using? I'm aware of a vaccine for horses for _Streptococcus equi equi_, but not one for _Streptococcus equi zooepidemicus_. Thanks in advance for the information.

[Dr. Welter is correct in what the article mentioned. While I understood they may be vaccinating for other common diseases, as there is not an approved canine vaccine for _Streptococcus equi zooepidemicus_, I reached out to the Cobb County Animal Services shelter in Marietta, Georgia.

The worker answering the telephone assured me they were not giving vaccines to animals potentially already ill, nor was she aware of a vaccine for _S. equi zooepidemicus_. She also reported there have been hundreds of calls on this same statement in the article. The shelter stated to the news outlet that the ill animals were getting an antibiotic (Covenia, or cefovecin) injection.

Somewhere between the interview and the writing of the article there developed a misunderstanding or a misinterpretation of any notes that may have been taken.

Healthy animals at the shelter are all vaccinated for such things as canine distemper or feline panleukopenia, commonly called feline distemper.

We appreciate Dr. Welter's question. - Mod.TG
