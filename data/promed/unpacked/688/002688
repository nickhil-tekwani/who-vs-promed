Around half a dozen family members of a Bhiwandi resident stood
outside ward no. 14 at Kasturba Hospital near Chinchpokli. "We don't
want to talk to anyone until we get the test report from the National
Institute of Virology," said the patient's son. He said he hadn't
seen his father in the last 24 hours and was unaware whether he was
on ventilator support. "He will come through this, and I am sure we
will be able to leave in a day or 2." All members of the family have
been given a preventive course of Ribavirin as a precautionary
measure, he added.

As news about the 48-year-old father suffering from a haemorrhagic
fever spread, doctors from the Bhiwandi-Nijampur Municipal
Corporation's (BNHC) Health Department visited the Gokul Nagar area.
Health officials surveyed around 200 families, checking people for symptoms.

BNMC's health officer K R Kharat said: "We spent the entire day
carrying out a survey in the Gokul Nagar area and checked around a
thousand residents." The authorities found no one with symptoms
similar to Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF). The only spot of
worry was the statement given by a neighbour. "The patient's
neighbour told us that the family visited Rajasthan 15 days ago and
had stopped at Ahmedabad [in Gujarat state] on the return journey,''
he said. Ahmedabad district has witnessed 3 deaths due to the CCHF in
the last 2 weeks. The Bhiwandi doctors also discovered that on his
return, the patient had taken ill and was receiving treatment at a
local hospital before he was moved to Bhatia Hospital in Mumbai. He
was then admitted to Jaslok Hospital before the doctors there
transferred him to Kasturba.

Dr Pratik Samdhani from Jaslok Hospital said: "The patient had a
brain haemorrhage along with renal failure. And because we could not
collect the blood samples in complete isolation as required when a
person is suffering from an infectious disease, we had to send him to
Kasturba."

The city may not need to worry about a Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic
fever [CCHF] outbreak just yet. The Pune-based National Institute of
Virology [NIV] said on Saturday [22 Jan 2011] that one of 2 samples
sent from Mumbai had tested negative. The other sample had been sent
by BMC [Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation] officials on Saturday
morning and results will be known on Sunday [23 Jan 2011], said NIV
director A C Mishra.

A senior doctor of Kasturba Hospital who examined the patient said
his brain scan had shown a mid-brain haemorrhage, but there could be
various causes. "It definitely did not look like a case of CCHF
fever. He doesn't have any fever or rash that is associated with
haemorrhagic fever. He has a brain haemorrhage and had bled through
the nose and mouth," the doctor said, adding that these didn't add up
to a classical haemorrhagic fever.

The patient, a resident of Bhiwandi, was shifted from 3 private
hospitals before being admitted in a serious condition to civic-run
Kasturba Hospital in Chinchpokli on Friday [21 Jan 2011] evening.

Public health minister Suresh Shetty told the Times of India that
there should be no reason to panic. Viral haemorrhagic fevers are
caused by viruses that live on animals and can spread from person to
person only after direct contact of blood or body fluids. "Let's wait
for the NIV results. If the result is positive, we will have to get
the animal husbandry department to check cattle, as they are carriers
of this disease," he added.

Additional municipal commissioner Manisha Mhaiskar said it would be
premature to label him as a patient with haemorrhagic fever. "We need
a positive report to say such things," she said, adding that there
was no suspected patient at present. Both BMC and NIV officials
refused to divulge the source of the 1st sample that tested negative
on Saturday [22 Jan 2011].

The man's sample will be tested along with hundreds rushed from
Ahmedabad, where 3 people have died because of the Crimean Congo
Hemorrhagic Fever in the last fortnight. The Mumbai patient is under
the care of infectious diseases specialist Dr Om Shrivastava who told
the Times of India that it had looked like a case of viral
haemorrhagic fever on clinical examination. "But, rather than
speculating, we should wait for the reports," said Dr Srivastava, who
also consults at Jaslok Hospital which transferred the man to
Kasturba Hospital.

Dr Abhay Chowdhary of Haffkine Institute in Parel said that CCHF
doesn't spread through droplets or air. "It spreads only through
contact with blood or fluids of an infected person. So it is a
healthcare worker who doesn't observe all safety precautions who is
at high risk,'' he said. The main task is to establish whether cattle
in the state are carrying ticks that are infected with the virus. "If
one tick is infected, it will spread the virus to other ticks all
over the state. Each tick produces 10 000 eggs, and they transmit the
virus to eggs as well. So, we need to take care of our livestock,"
said Dr Chowdhury.

The state government has called a meeting of all health and animal
husbandry department officials for Monday [24 Jan 2011] morning. "We
will have the NIV report by then and can decide the further course of
action,'' said minister Shetty.

[These 2 reports justify the skepticism expressed previously
regarding the preliminary diagnosis of CCHF, which now appears to
have been proposed on the basis of the patient's travel through
Ahmedabad (Gujarat state) earlier, where 3 cases of CCHF have been
confirmed. It is likely that the Mumbai patient's condition is the
result of a brain haemorrhage and may not be a consequence of an
infection. Results from the analysis of a 2nd sample of unspecified
clinical material submitted to the NIV are awaited.
