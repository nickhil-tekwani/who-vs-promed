The Austrian government has ordered a nationwide lockdown for unvaccinated people starting at midnight [Sun 14 Nov 2021] to combat rising coronavirus infections and deaths.

The move prohibits unvaccinated people 12 and older from leaving their homes except for basic activities such as working, grocery shopping, going for a walk -- or getting vaccinated.

Authorities are concerned about rising infections and deaths and that soon hospital staff will no longer be able to handle the growing influx of COVID-19 patients.

"It's our job as the government of Austria to protect the people," Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg told reporters in Vienna on [Sun 14 Nov 2021]. "Therefore we decided that starting [Mon 15 Nov 2021] there will be a lockdown for the unvaccinated."

The lockdown affects about 2 million people in the Alpine country of 8.9 million, the APA news agency reported. It doesn't apply to children under 12 because they cannot yet officially get vaccinated.

The lockdown will initially last for 10 days and police will go on patrol to check people outside to make sure they are vaccinated, Schallenberg said, adding that additional forces will be assigned to the patrols.

Unvaccinated people can be fined up to 1450EUR (USD1660) if they violate the lockdown.

Austria has one of the lowest vaccination rates in Western Europe: only around 65% of the total population is fully vaccinated. In recent weeks, Austria has faced a worrying rise in infections. Authorities reported 11 552 new cases on [Sun 14 Nov 2021]; a week ago there were 8554 new daily infections.

Deaths have also been increasing in recent weeks. On [Sun 14 Nov 2021], 17 new deaths were reported. Overall, Austria's pandemic death toll stands at 11 706, APA reported.

The 7-day infection rate stands at 775.5 new cases per 100 000 inhabitants. In comparison, the rate is at 289 in neighboring Germany, which has already also sounded the alarm over the rising numbers.

Schallenberg pointed out that while the 7-day infection rate for vaccinated people has been falling in recent days, the rate is rising quickly for the unvaccinated.

"The rate for the unvaccinated is at over 1700, while for the vaccinated it is at 383," the chancellor said.

Schallenberg also called on people who have been vaccinated to get their booster shot, saying that otherwise "we will never get out of this vicious circle."

[See https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-59283128 for vaccination rates in individual European countries. Eastern Europe has the lowest rates - see report below. But Austria has one of the lowest rates in western Europe. This lockdown will lead to a large decrease in contact between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, and unvaccinated individuals with each other. It is hoped by the government that this will cut down transmission severely. - Mod.LK]

At the main hospital in Romania's capital, the morgue ran out of space for the dead in recent days, and doctors in Bulgaria have suspended routine surgeries so they can tend to a surge in COVID-19 patients. In the Serbian capital, the graveyard now operates an extra day during the week in order to bury all the bodies arriving.

For 2 months now, a stubborn wave of virus infections has ripped mercilessly through several countries in Central and Eastern Europe, where vaccination rates are much lower than elsewhere on the continent. While medical workers pleaded for tough restrictions or even lockdowns, leaders let the virus rage unimpeded for weeks.

"I don't believe in measures. I don't believe in the same measures that existed before the vaccines," Serbian Prime Minister Ana Brnabic said last month [October 2021] as the Balkan nation sustained some of its worst daily death tolls of the pandemic. "Why do we have vaccines then?"

A World Health Organization official declared earlier this month [November 2021] that Europe is again at the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic. While several Western European countries are seeing spikes in infections, it is nations to the East that are driving fatalities. Romania, Bulgaria and the Balkan states recorded some of the highest per-capita death rates in the world in the first week of [November 2021], according to the WHO.

Experts say fumbled vaccination campaigns and underfunded and mismanaged health systems set the stage for the latest outbreaks, which gathered pace as leaders dithered. Some are acting now, but many doctors say it took too long and is still not enough.

Many governments in the region are facing elections soon, and that no doubt made them reluctant to force people to get vaccinated or impose unpopular lockdowns even in former communist nations that once carried out mandatory inoculations without hesitation or where leaders were quick to introduce closures earlier in the pandemic.

But politicians' failure to quickly heed the calls of the medical community has likely undermined an already weak trust in institutions in countries where corruption is widespread. Misinformation about vaccines has also found fertile ground amid the broader distrust of authority.

That has left countries stumbling through the latest surge with few protections. While nations around the world have struggled with resistance to vaccines, many in Central and Eastern Europe have particularly low rates for places where supply is not an issue. Bulgaria and Romania, both in the European Union, have fully vaccinated about 23% and 35% of their populations, respectively. Bosnia and Herzegovina has just 21% fully vaccinated.

Referring to Romania's slow response, physician and health statistician Octavian Jurma described his country as a "textbook example" of the "tragic consequences produced by a political takeover of the pandemic response."

Leaders finally introduced a curfew this month, requiring people who don't have a COVID pass -- which shows proof of vaccination, recovery from the illness or a negative test -- to stay at home from 10 pm to 5 am. Infections have since dropped slightly, but hospitals remain overwhelmed.

At the main one in Bucharest, the bodies of those who died from COVID-19 lined a hallway in recent days because there was no room in the morgue. Part of a waiting room was transformed into an emergency ward, with the raising of a plastic sheet.

In Serbia, some hospitals are so swamped that they are only handling virus patients -- leaving doctors to sue Brnabic, whose government faces elections in [April 2022]. "Since Brnabic said she doesn't believe in measures, some 900 people have died," Slavica Plavsic, a lung disease specialist, told N1 television on [Thu 21 Oct 2021]. The prime minster has rejected that criticism, saying on [Thu 11 Nov 2021] that she is proud of her government's response.

Meanwhile, authorities at the graveyard in Belgrade say that now they have an average of 65 burials a day, compared with between 35 and 40 before the pandemic. Gravediggers now bury people on Sundays -- which typically they didn't -- to handle the load.

In neighboring Hungary, few mitigating measures are in place. Like Serbia's, Hungary's government says it would prefer to rely on vaccinations. With nearly 60% of people fully vaccinated, the country is better placed than most in the region -- but that still leaves a large swath of the population unprotected.

Hungary's government earlier this month ordered mask-wearing on public transportation and allowed private employers to mandate vaccines for their staff.

But Gyula Kincses, chairman of the Hungarian Chamber of Doctors, said that that was "too little, too late" and recommended that masks be made mandatory in all indoor spaces.

In a recent radio interview, Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose populist party faces election next spring [2022], said that mandatory vaccinations would "be beyond the limits of what Hungarians will accept," even while acknowledging the new restrictions could only slow, not stop, the virus's spread.

Hospitals in Bulgaria, with its low vaccination rate, were forced to temporarily suspended all non-emergency surgeries so more doctors could treat the influx of COVID-19 patients.

"Politicians now think only about the elections, but there inevitably will be a lockdown, however in tragic circumstances," Ivan Martinov, a leading cardiologist at Sofia's main emergency hospital, told national radio. Parliamentary elections are being held on [Sun 14 Nov 2021].

Soaring infections appear to have been a wake-up call to some extent in Croatia, which saw unusually large lines of people waiting for vaccines in recent days.

Authorities said on [Wed 10 Nov 2021] that more than 15 000 people received their 1st dose a day earlier -- a significant jump after vaccinations all but halted in the Adriatic country of 4.2 million.

Croatia and neighboring Slovenia have also introduced COVID passes in recent weeks.

But medical organizations in Slovenia have warned that the Alpine country's health system is still on the verge of collapse. They urgently appealed to people to do their best to avoid seeking urgent care in the coming months.

"There are traffic accidents, accidents at work, other infections," gasped Bojana Baovic, head of Slovenia's Medical Chamber. "This is an alarming situation that we can cope with through maximum solidarity."

["As Europe finds itself at the center of the COVID-19 pandemic once again, experts say it should serve as a warning to the U.S. and other countries. Case numbers have soared across the continent -- more than 50% last month -- and the worrying trend has continued this month (November 2021) as winter begins to bite."

Tom Wenseleers, an evolutionary biologist and biostatistician at KU Leuven, a university in Belgium, felt "low vaccine uptake and high vaccine hesitancy were largely to blame. It's not due to lack of vaccines," he said, noting that the joint procurement of vaccines at the European Union level meant all 27 member states "were able to buy equivalent quantities of vaccines".

"Despite having access to vaccines, those countries did not manage to convince their population to get vaccinated," he said. "At least 1 in 3 people in countries in eastern Europe do not trust the health care system, compared to an average of 18% across the EU, a European Commission poll known as the Eurobarometer found, Reuters reported. [https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/outbreak-worsens-covid-19-cases-eastern-europe-near-20-million-2021-10-24/]

That "means that high case rates there translate [into] a very high death toll," Wenseleers said.

Danny Altmann, a professor of immunology at Imperial College London, said that as the first winter with the delta variant approaches, he was "not sure if people in Eastern Europe appreciate how punishing the pandemic continues to be in the time of delta."

[3] UK: exit strategy Operation Rampdown
Date: Sun 14 Nov 2021
Source: The Daily Mail [edited]
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10198985/Operation-Rampdown-Codename-revealed-Government-papers-dismantle-key-Covid-measures-year.html


Britain's response to COVID is set to be dramatically scaled back early next year [2022] as part of a pandemic 'exit strategy' code named Rampdown.

The secret Whitehall plan is detailed in official Government documents leaked to The Mail on [Sun 14 Nov 2021]. They describe how much of the Government's £37 billion emergency programme for dealing with the virus will be dismantled and the country prepared for living with COVID 'for years to come'.

The extraordinary 160-page dossier includes a string of documents marked 'official sensitive' drawn up by the senior Government officials tasked with winding down Britain's battle against the pandemic.

The file reveals how the Government is set to:

- Axe the legal requirement for those who catch the virus to self-isolate for 10 days;
- End free COVID tests and instead allow private companies to charge for lateral flow and PCR tests;
- Shut down the national 'Test and Trace' system, which identifies those who may have been exposed to the virus;
- Focus the fight against COVID on tackling local outbreaks and protecting 'highest risk settings', such as care homes;
- Scrap £500 payments for those on low incomes who must quarantine.

In the documents, experts say COVID will remain at 'endemic' levels for years and that mutant strains of the virus will also 'remain a very real risk'. But, crucially, the Government's central planning assumption - described as the 'leaving soon' scenario - predicts there will be 'no winter resurgence' of the virus.

The revelations come as the number of new COVID cases plunged by more than a quarter in just over 3 weeks - from 52 009 a day to 38 351 - and more than 12 million people have had their booster vaccines.

The leaked Rampdown plans will be hailed by business owners and families exhausted by Britain's 2-year battle against the virus.

Professor Robert Dingwall of Nottingham Trent University, one of the UK's leading sociologists and a former Government adviser, said: 'I very much welcome the fact that people are planning for the end of the emergency and the restoration of everyday life. Treating COVID like any other respiratory infection should encourage people to dial down the fear and anxiety that have bedevilled the country for the past couple of years.'

But one Whitehall source has told The Mail on [Sun 14 Nov 2021] that some systems for monitoring the spread of the disease have already been shut down, sparking alarm among top Government scientists.

Another source also said large numbers of health experts who have led the fight against the virus for 18 months are 'just walking away' from the Government, resulting in a huge 'loss of knowledge'.

'It's totally over, in the minds of Ministers,' the source said. 'But what happens if a new variant arrives and they have just shut down the whole national infrastructure? Are we retaining enough knowledge from the £37 billion investment over the past 2 years? I really don't think we are.'

The Rampdown strategy is being hammered out as part of a 6-week review of the Government's 'test, trace and isolate regime' by officials at the UK Health Security Agency, a new body headed by former Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr. Jenny Harries.

The documents reveal that the officials are examining 'what activities can we start ramping down before [April 2022]?' and what the 'end state' of Britain's response to COVID should be after [April 2022].

Their conclusions are due to be finalised by Dr. Harries and other key officials this weekend before being submitted to Health Secretary Sajid Javid. It is likely the Government will unveil the plan by the end of the year [2021], unless there is a resurgence of cases caused by an unmanageable new strain of the virus.

Crucially, the documents reveal that Ministers are set to abandon attempts to stop COVID-19 spreading 'at all costs'.

Instead, health officials will judge future policies against the same kind of cost-benefit analysis used to decide whether the NHS can afford expensive new drugs.

'We will no longer be prioritising the previous objectives of breaking chains of transmission at all costs,' one document stated.

Another document, discussed earlier this month [November 2021], declared the Government will 'end national trace and self-isolation policies' and 'move from whole population approaches to targeting the vulnerable'.

Insiders say the Rampdown strategy was partly being driven by the need to rein in the vast sums being spent on the pandemic.

The controversial Test and Trace service was set up in [May 2020] with a whopping £22 billion budget. It received a further £15 billion this year but its funding is expected to be dramatically cut next year [2022].

'Essentially, they have to run everything down by the end of [March 2022] because then the funding has gone,' a source said. Meanwhile, a 2nd major review, codenamed Rising Tide, is drawing up plans for how to respond to any new mutant strain of the virus arriving in the UK. Ministers will be presented with a list of 'core functions' that will be needed to respond to any future devastating outbreak.

A Government spokesman said last night: 'We have published the autumn and winter plan for managing the response to coronavirus, which remains a serious risk. 'We keep our approach under review, and no decisions have been taken about next year [2022].'
