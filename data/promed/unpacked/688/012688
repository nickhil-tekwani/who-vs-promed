[It is time to change the name of this thread. Since late August 2009
Uttar Pradesh has been reporting acute encephalitis of unidentified
etiology, suspected to include cases of Japanese encephalitis. One
might have expected a definitve lab result from the Mational Institute
of Virology in Pune by now. We wonder if they have excluded Nipah
virus; south UP appears to be just within the range of _Pteropus_, the
fruit bat vector. - Mod.JW]

Another 3 children succumbed to encephalitis [in Gorakhpur, Uttar
Pradesh], taking the toll of the viral disease in eastern Uttar
Pradesh districts to 545 so far this year [2009].

Additional director, health, LP Rawat said that the dead included 2
from Kushinagar and one from Maharajganj. The deaths took place over
the last 2 days. Some 11 persons suffering from the disease[s] have
been admitted to district hospitals.

Out of the 3088 patients admitted to various hospitals with Japanese
encephalitis and acute encephalitis syndrome, 545 have died. Japanese
encephalitis is transmitted by mosquitoes and causes inflammation of
the membranes around the brain.

[Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and the acute encephalitis syndrome
of unspecified etiology, perhaps enteroviruses, continue to claim
victims in Uttar Pradesh. No mention was made in this report about
ongoing vaccination for JEV.
