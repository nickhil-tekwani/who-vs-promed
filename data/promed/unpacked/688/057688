One question regarding the use of pesticides for chemical fishing in Lake
Victoria was the use of something called "Ambush". It may not be the same
substance, but "Ambush" is a trade name for Zeneca's formulation of the
pesticide permethrin (another trade name by a different company is Pounce).
Permethrin is one of a group of insecticides called synthetic pyrethroids;
they were developed to mimic (and improve) the activity of pyrethrum, a
naturally produced insecticide found in the flowers of a chrysanthemum from
east Africa. Like other synthetic pyrethroids, permethrin is relatively
non-toxic to mammals (oral rat LD50s typically in excess of 2,000 mg/kg),
however it is highly toxic to insects and also to fish and aquatic
invertebrates. Consequently, use of permethrin for chemical fishing would
be consistent with the pesticide's high toxicity to fish. If you are going
to do something as unwise as chemical fishing, I suppose using a synthetic
pyrethroid is a lesser evil given the (relatively) low mammalian
toxicities, as compared to other insecticides. (Information on labels and
MSDS sheets for currently labelled agricultural pesticides is available
through a CRC Press site at www.greenbook.net.)
However, the report of pesticide poisoning associated with chemical fishing
that was recently posted, is not (at least to the best of my knowledge)
consistent with permethrin intoxication. Acute diarrhoea and vomiting seem
to more likely to be associated with other types of pesticides (such as
organophosphates or other cholinesterase inhibitors). Presumably, if
"Laboratory tests have proved the pesticide contamination", those tests
should be able to establish the active ingredient, although I note that
establishing the causal agent for pesticide poisonings is not necessarily
straightforward.
As a speculation, I would guess that chemicals used in fishing must be
diverted from agricultural uses. Consequently, different compounds may be
used for chemical fishing (perhaps some indication of which are the most
frequently used agricultural insecticides around Lake Victoria would
provide a good starting point). Obviously, identifying the pesticides
involved is crucial for proper management of poisonings.
This alarming misuse of pesticides highlights an ongoing health problem
with insecticides - the potentially serious health effects of their
(illegal) misuse, as we have seen in watermelon poisonings and similar
cases in the U.S. This is one of the reasons I and other entomologists have
argued that we should consider moving to prescription use of pesticides,
although this is probably a naive expectation for Africa (and it may be
just as naive for the U.S.).

Ambush is a registered trade name for permethrin, a synthetic pyrethroid
insecticide that is highly toxic to fish but practically non-toxic to
humans by ingestion. (It has moderate inhalation toxicity). Ambush's
alleged misuse in Lake Victoria, East Africa is an environmentally unsound
practice but not one that is likely a direct threat to human health by
ingestion of poisoned fish.
See EXTOXNET (<http://ace.orst.edu/cgi-bin/mfs/01/pips/permethr.htm> ) for
information on permethrin toxicity.
The report of 33 human deaths from consumption of poisoned fish in Cabo
Delgado, Mozambique almost certainly reflects misuse of pesticides more
toxic to humans than permethrin (possibly mevinphos as this chemical has a
history of misuse for fishing with resulting human health effects). The Pan
African News Service article on the Mozambique deaths notes that laboratory
tests detected pesticide contamination but the article did not indicate a
chemical identity, common name, or trade name.
It should be noted that natural toxins derived from plants (such as
rotenone) have been employed by fisherman for many centuries in most parts
of the world precisely because of these toxins' high selective toxicity to
fish but relatively low risk to humans. The misuse of chemical pesticides
toxic to aquatic organisms carries serious environmental risks. Chemicals
with broad spectrum toxicity may cause serious human health effects, as
well. The poisoning incident reported from Mozambique reflects poor
regulatory control by government agencies and poor recognition among
fishermen of the environmental and human health effects resulting from
pesticide misuse.

In reply to your ProMED-mail article I can tell you that "Ambush" is (one
of the) trade name(s) for "Permethrin". I have attached information from
Extoxnet.

Add Extoxnet's website to your "Favourites" because it is a very useful
resource. Hope this is of interest for you.

[Yesterday's posts indicated that Aldicarb, a more lethal chemical than
permethrin, may be the villain. However, many years ago I was involved in a
study on a lethal, acute necrotic hepatitis of children in the central
Amazon basin. Various expert medical teams had come up with nothing so a
veterinary team was sent in. Our tentative conclusion, based on the
histories from parents, was a possible synergistic effect between viral
hepatitis (a widespread problem in the Amazon) and the use of plant
rotenone by families fishing when the hypothetically-infected children swam
in the water to recover the chemically stunned fish. It got no further than
that. The rotenone was obtained by crushing the chemical-laden wild plant
against the outside of the dugout.
Obviously there is a need to have a better identification of the
chemical(s) being used for chemical fishing in Lake Victoria and elsewhere
in East Africa.
