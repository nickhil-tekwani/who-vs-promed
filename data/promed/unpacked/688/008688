A local factory worker [in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa] died of high grade-fever with the family blaming death on Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever.

Another villager also tested positive for CCHF. According to family sources, a 45-year-old resident of Hattar village, had suffered from high grade-fever for around a week, while he was treated at a local private hospital as a dengue patient. The man was later shifted to Islamabad's PIMS hospital, where he died. The family claimed that the PIMS doctors suspected its member suffered from Congo fever.

However, the health department rejected the claim. Also, a 60-year-old resident of Bandi Muneem village [Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa], was admitted to Pims, Islamabad, tested positive for CCHF. The doctors said the patient's condition was improving.

When contacted, Dr Sher Bahadur, head of the dengue programme at the Haripur [Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa], DHO [District Health Office], said a team of doctors had visited the house of the [45-year-old man] and found out that he had died of blood cancer and pneumonia and not CCHF.

He said the team also visited the house of [the 60-year-old] and found him to be a patient of CCHF. Dr Bahadur said [the man] was a farmer, who used to have direct contact with farm animals, so he got the infection after tick bite.

Two suspected patients of Congo virus have been brought to Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) Hospital in Islamabad on [Fri 4 Oct 2019].

The couple belongs to Haripur [Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa] and was brought to PIMS Hospital today [4 Oct 2019] where medics confirmed that the man is suffering from Congo virus, whereas, his wife's blood samples were sent to National Institute of Health (NIH) for its confirmation, sources said.

It is pertinent to mention here that at least 2 cases have emerged so far since Eidul Azha [Festival of the Sacrifice] festival in PIMS Hospital.

It must be noted that the tick-borne viral disease had infected 37 people this year [2019] and so far out of them 17 died.

On [25 Jul 2019], a Congo virus alert had been issued for the metropolis [Islamabad], stipulating precautionary instructions for all those people who are visiting cattle farms.

The disease is caused when a tick attaches itself to the skin of cattle and when that infected tick or animal comes in contact with people, the highly contagious virus is transmitted into the human body and the person falls ill. The initial symptoms of Congo fever include headache, high fever, rashes, back pain, joint pain, stomach pain, and vomiting.

[The 1st confirmed case of CCHF in Pakistan was reported in 1976 followed by outbreaks from almost all areas of the country, mainly Balochistan province, where the disease still remains entrenched. Genetic analysis of the viruses has confirmed the presence of Asia-1 and Asia-2 genotypes in this province. In Pakistan, CCHF exhibits 2 annual peaks, between March and May and again, between August and October [Sheikh AS, Sheikh AA, Sheikh NS, et al. Bi-annual surge of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF): a five-year experience. https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(04)00125-0/fulltext].

Since 2000, there is an increasing trend in the number of cases, and cases have been reported from previously uninfected areas across all provinces and regions. Mapping the areas with relatively high incidence of the tick vector and the virus is an essential step to target surveillance and prevention programmes.

Islamabad territory hospitals receive mostly referred cases from parts of KP and Kashmir regions in addition to some local cases. - Mod.UBA
