[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 596 624 with 81 394 cases reported by China. There are now a total of 515 230 confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported from 202 countries/locations outside mainland China, representing an increase of 64 346 cases when compared with the data on 26 Mar 2020, with the USA accounting for 18 548 (28.8%) cases, Italy accounting for 5909 (9.2%) cases, Spain for 7933 (12.3%) and Germany for 6933 (10.8%) of the newly confirmed cases. The total number of confirmed cases reported from outside of China now represents 86.4% of the total number of reported cases. The epicenter has shifted outside of China to Western Europe and the USA. The USA now represents 17.5% of the global cases of COVID-19. The USA and Italy have surpassed China in total number of cases. A global total of 27 343 deaths have been reported, 24 048 (87.9%) outside mainland China.

It is now clear that while China has the largest population in the world, and was the original location where the COVID-19 outbreak started, it has markedly reduced transmission to a manageable level, now monitoring all arrivals in the country from outside. South Korea has slowly decreased daily new case counts hovering around 100 in recent days. The USA is now number one outside of China for numbers of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and Italy is now number 2. Iran has slowed down in growth rate and Spain has been accelerating. To get an understanding of how rapidly things increase, look at the last entry to the "greater than 1000 cases list -- South Africa reported its 1st imported case on 5 Mar 2020 and now, 3 weeks later, has surpassed 1000 newly confirmed cases. Another country of concern is Turkey. The 1st confirmed case was reported on 11 Mar 2020 and in 16 days the country has confirmed 5698 cases. - Mod.MPP]

[This is the 4th consecutive day with no newly confirmed cases reported from Wuhan or all of Hubei province in the past 24 hours, but 29 suspected cases are reported from the province. All reported newly confirmed cases are imported. There are 54 newly confirmed cases reported to have been confirmed in the past 24 hours.

According to the report above, a total of 81 394 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, representing an increase of 54 cases in the past 24 hours since yesterday's (26 Mar 2020) report was prepared. In addition, 3 deaths were reported, all in Hubei province (4 in Wuhan). 65 new cases were reported from Hong Kong, which bears watching as the cases have been slowly but steadily climbing. And Macau reported 4 additional newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, bringing their total to 34.

54 were imported cases into China. Cases were reported by Shanghai (17), Guangdong (11), Fujian (6), Tianjin (5), Zhejiang (4) Beijing (3), Liaoning(3), Inner Mongolia (2), Jilin (2), and Shandong (1), bringing the total number of imported cases to 595.

As reported on 24 Mar 2020, China ended the lockdown in Hubei and will end it in Wuhan on 6 Apr 2020. There is much caution and skepticism in the media over the reality of the zero case reports. The world will be watching carefully to see if this is safe timing...

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 146 cases and 5 deaths as compared with yesterday's 24 hour period (26-27 Mar 2020) when there were 91 newly confirmed cases. The daily case count had been at or below 100 newly confirmed cases per day for 6 consecutive days but has increased to 146 in the past 24 hours. Daegu continues to stand out as a focal point for transmission with 69.5% of the total cases reported followed by Gyeongbuk with 13.6% of the total cases reported. In the past 24 hours, Daegu reported 48.6% of the total newly confirmed cases increasing from 37.4% in the preceding 24 hour period. The proportion of newly confirmed case reports in Seoul was 12.3% and in Gyeonggi 14.4%. Quarantined imported cases represented 16.4% of the newly confirmed cases.

Similar to what is being seen in China, Korea is identifying increasing numbers of imported cases returning to South Korea. They are now up to 168 imported cases in quarantine with the 1st report of patients in quarantine on 16 Mar 2020, when 4 cases were reported (COVID-19 update (41): global, surge capacity, vaccine development, WHO 20200316.7096222). Like in China, there is strict surveillance and follow-up of these individuals, reversing the pattern of the western countries strengthening screenings of individuals from South Korea and China. There are obvious concerns regarding initiating new clusters that might escape into the community.

In the English language update for today (28 Mar 2020; https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030) there are a series of tables and graphs describing the epidemiologic characteristics of the ongoing outbreak in South Korea. Figure 5 shows the weekly distribution of location of importation by WHO region, where one clearly sees the transition from predominantly China, to increasing from non-China Asia, to increasing Europe, and now increasing both from Europe and the Americas. Other graphs include age and gender distribution of cases and deaths with the population older than 80 years having a 16.2% crude case fatality rate.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was expanded to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of non-essential businesses. It is now 18 days since the start of the lockdown in the north and 16 days since the countrywide lockdown. The MOH website mentions there has been a slowing down of growth. The growth curve has not altered its trajectory as yet.

C. Iran: 32 232 cases, 2378 deaths

https://gulfnews.com/world/mena/coronavirus-iran-continues-to-be-the-worst-coronavirus-hit-country-in-the-middle-east-with-144-new-deaths-1.70665466


The coronavirus pandemic continues to bulldoze its way throughout the middle east, causing more fatalities east and west and upending life in most of the countries.

Iran on Friday [27 Mar 2020] announced 144 new deaths from the novel coronavirus, bringing the official number of fatalities to 2378 in one of the world's worst-hit countries, according to AFP. "In the past 24 hours, we've had 2926 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 infections across the country," health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said in a televised news conference. "This brings the overall confirmed cases to at least 32 332," he added, noting that 11 133 of those hospitalised so far have recovered. Jahanpour said nearly 2900 of those infected are in a "severe" condition.

He said that the rising number of confirmed cases was due to Iranians increasingly "self-declaring" symptoms and undergoing testing. The ministry has repeatedly called on citizens to visit a website and report potential symptoms. The data, together with their phone number and ID, is used to identify potential cases.

Iran has imposed strict new containment measures, after weeks of public appeals largely failed to deter hundreds of thousands taking to the roads to visit family for the Persian New Year holidays. State television on Friday [27 Mar 2020] showed police checkpoints at Tehran's entrances and exits preventing residents leaving and non-residents entering. It said motorists were identified by their car plates and IDs and that several vehicles were impounded and drivers fined for violating the measures.

[In the 24 hours from 26 to 27 Mar 2020, the number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran grew from 29 406 to, 32 332, an increase of 2926 newly confirmed cases. The number of deaths has also increased from 2234 to 2378 an increase of 144 deaths in the 24-hour period.

It appears as though inter-provincial movement is now being prohibited and enforced, but there is no mention of intra provincial or "shelter in place" recommendations.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA, as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 104 142 including 1696 deaths. New York state, with 46 262 (44.4%) cumulative cases reports and 7285 (39.3%) newly confirmed cases over the past 24 hours, is clearly the epicenter of the outbreak in the USA, although case reporting elsewhere is showing increases.

The CDC website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html has 2 epidemic curves. One focuses on date of confirmation of disease, the other on date of onset of illness. The curve of interest, by date of onset of disease, is based on 20.9% of the number of cases plotted on the epidemic curve using date of confirmation of disease.

[Spain has been rapidly accelerating in terms of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2. As of today (27 Mar 2020), there have been a total of 64 059 cases with 7871 cases confirmed in the preceding 24 hours. The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population is 127.3. It is now 2nd in Europe, behind Italy, and 3rd globally behind the USA and Italy in terms of absolute numbers of cases.

Of the 64 059 cases, 36.293 (56.7%) were hospitalized, 4165 (6.5%) were admitted to the ICU. The crude reported death rate was 7.6% with more deaths occurring than reported ICU admissions.

Holland America MS Zaandam cruise ship

Four elderly passengers were dead and 138 others complained of flu-like symptoms Friday [27 Mar 2020] aboard Holland America's MS Zaandam as the ship searched for a port amid the coronavirus pandemic.

The ship currently is off the coast of Panama. It took on medical supplies Thursday night [26 Mar 2020] from sister ship, Rotterdam, the company said in a Facebook post. The Panamanian government also has given permission for healthy passengers to be transferred to the Rotterdam following health screenings.

"Priority for the 1st guests to transfer will be given to those on Zaandam with inside staterooms and who are over 70. Once aboard Rotterdam, all guests will continue to remain in their staterooms until disembarkation. Any guests who are currently ill, or in isolation as a close contact, and all crew will remain on Zaandam," Holland America said.

It continued: "Currently, 53 guests [4%] and 85 crew [14%] have reported to Zaandam's medical center with influenza-like illness symptoms. There are 1243 guests and 586 crew on board. On Zaandam, there are 4 doctors and 4 nurses. On Rotterdam, there are 2 doctors and 4 nurses."

No one has left the Zaandam since [14 Mar 2020] at Punta Arenas, Chile. Symptoms first surfaced on the ship [22 Mar 2020].

The company said it is still trying to secure permission from the Panamanian government to transit the Panama Canal so it can sail to Fort Lauderdale, Florida. [In more recent media reports, permission to cross the canal was denied. - Mod.MPP]

The ship left Buenos Aires, Argentina, on [7 Mar 2020] and originally had been scheduled to end the cruise [21 Mar 2020] in Santiago, Chile. The company has since suspended global cruise operations for 30 days and decided to end current cruises as quickly as possible.

An analysis by the Guardian indicates at least 10 ships from a variety of cruise lines carrying nearly 10 000 passengers currently are at sea and in search of docking permission.

https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200327-sitrep-67-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=b65f68eb_4


*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CET

Highlights
----------
- Two new countries/territories/areas from the Region of the Americas [2] have reported cases of COVID-19.

- The total global number of COVID-19 cases has surpassed 500 000.

- Addressing the Extraordinary Summit on COVID-19, the WHO Director-General called on G20 leaders to fight, unite, and ignite against COVID-19. More information can be found at https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-remarks-at-the-g20-extraordinary-leaders-summit-on-covid-19---26-march-2020.

- WHO concluded the technical support mission to Egypt on [25 Mar 2020]. More information can be found on the Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office site (http://www.emro.who.int/media/news/who-delegation-concludes-covid-19-technical-mission-to-egypt.html).

- OpenWHO celebrates 1 million enrollments today. 70% of the total enrollments are on COVID-19 resources, reflecting the critical role the platform is playing in supporting the response to the pandemic. On [25 Mar 2020], a new course was launched describing how to design and operate treatment centres for the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 resources are hosted on 2 learning channels: one for courses in official WHO languages (https://openwho.org/channels/covid-19 and a 2nd for courses in additional national languages at https://openwho.org/channels/covid-19-national-languages).

- The number of countries implementing additional health measures that significantly interfere with international traffic has increased since the declaration of COVID-19 as a public health emergency of international concern. The United Nations World Tourism Organization launched a Crisis Committee to review the impact of the outbreak on the aviation, shipping and tourism sectors and propose innovative solutions for recovery. Greater detail can be found in in the 'subject in focus' section below.

Subject in focus: Additional health measures significantly interfere with international traffic
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As of [25 Mar 2020], 136 countries have implemented additional health measures that significantly interfere with international traffic as defined under Article 43 of the International Health Regulations (2005) (Table 1.- Number of States Parties officially reporting additional health measures that significantly interfere with international traffic (that is, more than 24h delay), under Article 43 of the IHR (2005) (by WHO region) [available at the source URL above])

WHO has shared information with Member States every week since [6 Feb 2020] through the Event Information Site, a secure platform accessible by national IHR focal points and United Nations (UN) agencies. The majority of measures relate to the denial of entry of passengers from countries experiencing outbreaks, followed by flight suspensions, visa restrictions, border closures, and quarantine measures. Figure 1 [Cumulative number of reported additional health measures; available at the source URL above] shows the cumulative number of restrictions in relation to the time of the declaration of COVID-19 as a public health emergency of international concern [30 Jan 2020], and the characterization of the situation as a pandemic [11 Mar 2020].

WHO has maintained weekly technical coordination with the aviation and tourism sectors. Interim Guidance on the Management of Ill Travellers at Points of Entry was published on [19 Mar 2020] [https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331512/WHO-2019-nCoV-POEmgmt-2020.2-eng.pdf]. IATA [International Air Transport Association] recently published the 3rd economic analysis, providing estimates of the economic impact of these travel restrictions [https://www.iata.org/en/iata-repository/publications/economic-reports/third-impact-assessment/]. On [25 Mar 2020], the UN World Tourism Organization launched a Crisis Committee [https://www.unwto.org/unwto-convenes-global-tourism-crisis-committee], bringing together actors from the aviation, shipping, and tourism sectors to review the impact of the outbreak on these sectors and propose innovative solutions for recovery. WHO has a technical advisory role in this committee.

These data come from Table 2: Countries, territories or areas with reported laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths. Data as of [10:00 AM 27 Mar 2020], available at the source URL above. I am presenting the regional case totals without the addition of China for consistency in following trends in the regions. - Mod.MPP]

WHO region (no. countries/territories): Total confirmed cases (new) / Total deaths (new) / Transmission classification [no. countries] local / no. countries imported / no. countries under investigation

Grand total (including China and Diamond Princess): 509 164 (46 484) / 23 335 (2501)

Terms:
- Community transmission is evidenced by chains of transmission for a large number of cases, or by increasing positive tests through routine screening of samples.
- Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.
- Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.
- Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.
- Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined).

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside China continues to grow and now totals 200. This includes 17 countries (including 3 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 60 countries (including 7 territories) from the European region, 10 from the Southeast Asia region, 21 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 51 countries (including 16 territories) from the Americas region, and 41 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

The Americas region is reporting 5425 new cases in the past 24 hours of which 87.8% were reported by the USA, and 11.2% reported by Canada. Looking at the individual country case reports it appears there was under-reporting from a number of countries (including the USA) so the next few days may have unusually high newly confirmed case counts. The European region continues with rapid transmission, having confirmed 36 414 (78.5%) new cases and 2155 (86.3%) deaths in the 24 hours since the last WHO update, with Italy accounting for 13.3 % of newly confirmed cases, Spain for 18.5% of newly confirmed cases, Germany accounting for 12.5% of newly confirmed cases, and France accounting for 14.6% of newly confirmed cases (bringing the total of these 4 countries accounting for 52.3% of newly confirmed cases in Europe, down from 70.5% yesterday 26 Mar 2020).

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported outside of China, by date of report and WHO region through [26 Mar 2020], at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. One sees the contribution of the ongoing epidemics in Europe and now the increasing cases in the Americas region, fueled by the USA but other countries are following suit. I keep repeating that it would be very nice to see an epidemic curve based on the date of onset of illness.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: it is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4). - Mod.MPP]
