Veterinary Research Institute (VRI) director Dr Abdul Aziz Jamaluddin said
that destroying the pigs infected with the Japanese B Encephalitis (JE)
might only minimise, not eliminate, the number of cases or chances of
people being infected.
"Research by the institute has found that people would not be infected by
the virus if they consumed pork. There are many other better steps that can
be taken to solve the problem such as reducing the population of pigs,
vaccinating them and monitoring cleanliness at pig farms."
"The main problem here is the _Culex_ sp. mosquito and we have to look into
ways to get rid of mosquito breeding spots and take steps to protect the
animals from being infected by it. It is not the pigs that are spreading
the virus," he told reporters after vaccinating pigs at Ampang near here
yesterday. [His suggestion is that the mosquito is transmitting or
spreading the virus, thus being the vector. - Mod.TG
Dr. Aziz was commenting on a statement by Perak Malay Chamber of Commerce
chairman, Datuk Mohamed Hamdan Hazizi, who urged the relevant authorities
to destroy all JE-infected animals in the country.
