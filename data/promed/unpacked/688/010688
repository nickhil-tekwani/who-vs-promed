HPAI (H5N1), 1st Outbreak In A Broiler Flock In Israel
-----------------------------------------------
Between 10 and 15 Mar 2006, the HPAI-H5N1 virus appeared suddenly in
several turkey flocks in different areas in the southern part of Israel.
Despite the fact that quarantine was declared within an area of 3 km from
the affected turkey farms, the disease appeared in a big broiler farm by 19
Mar 2006.
The farm is situated in a southeast direction and about 4 km from the 1st
outbreak in turkeys [Ein Hashlosha]. The broiler farm is a 160 000 broilers
unit with 13 chicken houses of different types from controlled environment
to conventional. The flock was about 40 days of age, and part of it was
already sent to the slaughterhouse.
Due to the appearance of the H5N1 virus at the turkey farm, the marketing
of the broilers was stopped, and PCR tests were performed before
continuation of marketing was permitted.
Despite the fact that the PCR results proved negative in the sample tested,
2 days after the samples were taken, a sudden increase in mortality was
observed in one out of 10 chicken houses. In a house containing 16 000
broilers, mortality increased from 10 birds per day to 400 the next day to
more than 800 by the 2nd day.
The only clinical signs within the flock were the sudden mortality of
apparently well-developed birds, with severe signs of cyanosis and ischemia
in the wattles, the comb, the legs and the skin of the belly (see pictures).
The tarsal and metatarsal areas were swollen and purple in color (see
pictures).
Post mortem examination did not reveal any special macroscopic change, and
only in some birds a slight grayish discoloration of the pancreas could be
seen.
Tracheal and cloacal swabs taken from sick birds proved positive by PCR
test to the H5N1 HPAI virus.

[This firsthand description might be helpful to poultry health specialists,
especially in view of the crucial importance of early detection of 1st
cases in previously unaffected countries. For the pictures, go to the above
URL.
The evolvement of the outbreak in Israel, a non-AI-vaccinating country with
a highly intensive, dense poultry industry (annual turnover of almost USD
600 million) and a relatively advanced animal health infrastructure,
deserves a close, instructive follow-up by industrialized countries. The
1st stages seem to be strikingly reminiscent of the UK 2001 FMD panzootic
(including the political ramifications, 2 weeks prior to general
elections!) with, on top of poultry and not mammals being the subject, one
important difference: the potential zoonotic implications of avian influenza.
On Wed 22 Mar 2006 evening, the Israeli TV and other media sources reported
that a 7th outbreak was suspected in moshav Beqaot, the Jordan Valley
(interactive map at
<http://www.eyeonisrael.com/>, click square 7).
Initial PCR tests indicated H5, but in view of the low mortality observed,
tests are being repeated. See

Israel to help PA confront deadly bird flu following Gaza outbreak
-----------------------------------------------
Israel said it will help the Palestinian Authority confront bird flu, after
initial tests conducted on dead chickens from the Gaza Strip indicated that
the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu has spread there.
This is the 1st outbreak of the disease in the Palestinian territories, the
Agriculture Ministry said Wednesday [22 Mar 2006]. The virus was found in
coops built on the ruins of the former settlement of Netzarim, in the
central Strip.
Yossi Yishai, director general of the Agriculture Ministry, has meanwhile
authorized assistance to the Palestinian Authority that is to include
protective gear and other equipment and guidance to Palestinians dealing
confronting the outbreak.
Israeli and Palestinian officials are set to meet Wednesday [22 Mar 2006]
evening at the Erez border crossing. Representatives from the Palestinian
Agriculture Ministry and Palestinian veterinarians will participate in the
session. They will be joined by the chief Israeli veterinarian at the
Agriculture Ministry and the head of the Gaza coordination administration.
The tests were conducted after another 200 chickens were found dead in a
coop in Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip early Wednesday [22 Mar 2006],
ministry spokeswoman Dafna Yarisca said.
Although final results will not be available for at least 48 hours, the
ministry has advised the Palestinians to treat the initial results as
definitive, because they came up positive for the H5 protein, Yarisca said.
Further tests will determine whether it is H5N1.
Israel conducts all such tests on behalf of the Palestinians, who do not
have the technology. The sides have been cooperating for months to try to
prevent the deadly bird flu from reaching the region.
Acting Palestinian Health Minister Ghassan Khatib confirmed that initial
tests indicated an outbreak of the flu, but could provide no further details.

[3] Russia: bird flu situation worsening says chief veterinarian

Bird flu situation worsening in Russia: chief veterinarian
-----------------------------------------------
Bird flu is posing a growing challenge in Russia, the chief veterinarian
said, noting that twice as many farm fowl had been culled or died so far
this year [2006] compared with all of 2005.
"Last year [2005] we lost 662 000 heads of poultry, which died or were
slaughtered. This year (so far) the figure is 1.3 million poultry," Sergei
Dankvert told a press briefing on the sidelines of a veterinarians' conference.
"This year [2006], the situation is more difficult (and) will depend on
steps taken in the regions," said Dankert, who heads the Russian Federal
Veterinary Control Service.
He said poultry needed to be protected from contact with wild birds, which
would reduce the risk of contamination by 50 percent, and he urged further
vaccinations.
"Last year [2005], the virus affected 62 towns in 10 Russian regions, while
since the start of 2006, already 56 towns in 9 regions have been affected,"
he said.
In 16 of the towns, infected birds have been slaughtered, but the virus is
still present in the other 40, Dankvert said.
Farms were affected in the southern regions of Stavropol, Krasnodar and
Dagestan, where "health and veterinary rules were not respected," he said.
The virus had also penetrated factory farming in Russia for the 1st time
this year [2006]. Hitherto, it had been found only in private holdings.
The official said he did not foresee problems over vaccines this year
[2006]. "We are not talking of general vaccination but vaccination in
particularly endangered regions," he said.
"The panic has been so great that the number of requests for vaccines to be
sent to regions has begun to grow in geometric progression," Dankvert added.
32 million vaccine [doses] would be produced in Russia by the end of this
month [March 2006], 42 million in April 2006 and 70 million in May 2006
with the aim of a production peak of 1.2 billion annually, he noted.
Demand on the Russian poultry market dropped by 20-25 percent between last
November [2005] and this month [March 2006] because of the bird flu scare,
Galina Bobyleva, head of the poultry producers' union, was quoted by the
Ria Novosti agency as saying.

[4] China: vaccines

OIE says some China bird flu vaccines ineffective
-----------------------------------------------
China may be using some substandard poultry vaccines to fight bird flu that
could allow birds to keep spreading the virus despite not showing symptoms,
a top animal health expert said on Tuesday [21 Mar 2006].
Christianne Bruschke, a member of the bird flu task force at the
Paris-based World Animal Health Organisation (OIE), said the vaccines made
in China at the Harbin Veterinary Institute conformed to international
standards and were fully effective.
"But there are local companies in China that produce vaccines, and it's
possible these don't have the efficacy of those made at Harbin," she told
Reuters.
Chinese officials have said their vaccines are effective and that no
healthy-looking bird has yet been found carrying H5N1.
But there have been outbreaks in areas where poultry were supposedly
already vaccinated, and this has raised the possibility that birds are
continuing to spread the virus.
"There are 2 possibilities," Bruschke said. "Either the vaccine is not
strong enough, or that it is a good vaccine but not administered properly.
Vaccines have to be given twice to be fully effective, maybe that is not
happening.
"When a vaccine is not effective enough, it could prevent clinical signs
from showing, but the bird could still spread the virus. That's certainly a
possibility," she said.
And she said poultry that had not been properly vaccinated may also pose a
health risk to humans, although it was difficult to quantify the danger.
Research in Europe, which did not import vaccines from China, showed drugs
[vaccines] stopped the spread of the virus, she said.
"The vaccines are, when administered properly according to manufacturers'
instructions, effective in preventing the spread in chickens and ducks,"
she said, adding that more research was needed on other bird species.
The Netherlands, France and Russia have announced plans to vaccinate some
of their poultry against bird flu. But Dutch farmers have mostly chosen to
wait before vaccinating their birds, because they fear a negative impact on
exports.
David King, the British government's chief scientific adviser, said the
often close contact between humans and chickens in China meant that
vaccines were particularly necessary there.
"The Chinese are using a number of different vaccines, and one of the
vaccines it is claimed has a high efficacy," he said.
"But we couldn't possibly use a vaccine that hadn't been fully through the
European procedures of testing," he added.

[OIE's comments are significant; see ProMED-mail's comments to "China,
Democratic Republic, HPAI vaccines & silent excretors" in 20060318.0837.
An extensive discussion on China's vaccination scheme may be found in
20051122.3388.
A list of the 9 vaccine plants in China, which were -- in November 2005 --
officially certified by the authorities to produce AI vaccines, is to be
found in 20051126.3431. We are aware of unofficial but generally reliable
information about the activity of (between 10 and 30) additional,
uncertified plants. One might hope that the Chinese authorities are taking
the necessary steps to remedy this undesirable situation. - Mod.AS]
