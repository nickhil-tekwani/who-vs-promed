Goats [kept] by a man in Dahod have been isolated after one of the animals died due to Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR), better known as sheep and goat plague. The viral disease is extremely contagious and can infect and even kill large parts of herds of animals like sheep and goats.

This is the 1st time that a PPR case has been reported in the Dahod district. Officials said that the infected goat belonged to a man who rears animals for meat. The man got alarmed after one of his goats died after suffering from cough and cold for a couple of days along with loose motions.

The man insisted that a test should be conducted to identify the ailment. The tests revealed that the goat was suffering from PPR.

Animal husbandry officer Kamleshgiri Gosai said that the man whose goat had died was asked to keep his remaining goats in the shed itself and not take them out for grazing. "This has been done to ensure that if more goats are infected, they do not spread it to other goats outside," he said.

Gosai said that the remaining 26 goats in the shed were not showing any symptoms of PPR. He added that there was no need to press panic triggers.

Since 1987, when PPR was reported from Tamil Nadu, southern India, the disease has been reported regularly from different parts of the country. It is currently considered an enzootic disease, circulating countrywide, causing a great loss to the small ruminant sector. (See review at <tinyurl.com/5bufcvke> and a report on PPR in Gujarat at https://www.ijcmas.com/abstractview.php?ID=22311&vol=10-7-2021&SNo=27). It is not clear whether the apparent geographical spread of the disease in the last 50 years is real or reflects increased awareness, wider availability of diagnostic tools or even a change in the virulence of the virus.

In October 2017, the European Union joined FAO and OIE in a global campaign to eradicate PPR. This (non-zoonotic) disease is considered to have a direct impact on over 300 million families who rely on small ruminants; 80% of the world's small ruminants are found in Africa, Asia and the Middle East.

A report covering the campaign from 2017 to 2021 is available at https://www.oie.int/app/uploads/2021/03/en-gep-ppr-finalweb.pdf. - Mod.AS
