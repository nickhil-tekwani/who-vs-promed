Virus Transmitted by Wild Rats Reaches Agricultural Zone of Santa
Catarina
----------
FLORIANOPOLIS: Technicians of the Ministry of Health arrived in
Santa Catarina today to evaluate a virus carried by wild rats that is
affecting a region in the west of the state [Santa Catarina. Hantavirus
[infection has already affected 6 people in the municipalities of Seara
and Presidente Castelo Branco, 5 children and 3 adults [but this adds
up to 8 people. Another 2 cases are under observation. All the [cases
live in the agricultural zone of Seara & Presidente Castelo Branco,
where the basic economic activity is maize cultivation.
According to Ministry [of Health officials, the wild rat is attracted by
the maize and transmits the illness through a virus that is airborne
[through dust containing its dried excreta - Mod.JW and can be fatal.

[According to GIDEON <http://www.cyinfo.com/> : "[Brazil's first 3
cases (2 fatal) [of hantavirus respiratory distress syndrome were
reported from Sao Paulo in 1993. 23 cases (17 fatal) were reported
during 1993 to 1999. 9 cases (7 fatal) were reported through Sept 1998
from Juquitiba (and other areas of Sao Paulo state). Antibody is
present in 8% of normal adults in this area. 2 cases (fatal) were
reported in 1998 in the City of Guariba (northeastern Sao Paulo). A
single (fatal) case was reported from southern Parana state in 1999.
The local strain is referred to as Juquitiba virus - reservoir unknown."
So Santa Catarina may be a new geographic location.
This article does not mention the symptom complex, nor does it give
any indication if there have been fatalities. ProMED-mail would like
more information on this suspected outbreak. - Mod.MPP
