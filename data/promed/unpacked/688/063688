Brief Report: Respiratory Illness Associated with Boot Sealant
Products -- 5 States, 2005-2006
During February 2005-February 2006, 6 regional poison control centers
in 5 states were consulted regarding 172 human and 19 animal (i.e.,
pet cat or dog) exposures to shoe or boot leather protection or
sealant products resulting in respiratory illness.
One product was associated with 126 cases of human illness and
another product with 7 cases. An ongoing investigation, begun in
December 2005, is being conducted by the poison centers. The majority
of cases occurred in Michigan, where poison control centers are
collaborating with the Michigan Department of Community Health to
further document exposures and adverse health effects from the
products. Results of the investigation of the 150 cases reported
during 2005 underscore the continuing need to assess the magnitude of
the problem, evaluate the toxic etiology of the products involved,
and determine how to prevent further cases of illness resulting from
use of the products.
A case was defined as a report to a poison control center of illness
after exposure to an aerosol agent used for waterproofing boots or
shoes; reports were made directly by persons exposed, by family
members or friends, or by health-care facilities where persons sought
treatment.
Specific illness symptoms were not required to meet the case
definition. During 2005, the number of cases increased substantially
with the onset of winter. One case was reported in February and one
in July; 5 were reported in August, 4 in September, 11 (7 percent) in
October, 36 (24 percent) in November, and 92 (61 percent) in
December. Regarding location, 84 (56 percent) cases were reported in
Michigan, 25 (17 percent) in Indiana, 19 (13 percent) in western
Pennsylvania, 12 (8 percent) in central Ohio, and 10 (7 percent) in Kentucky.
Ages of the 150 patients ranged from 1 to 70 years (median: 33
years); 33 (22 percent) were aged less than18 years. Among the
patients, 50 percent were the persons in their households who most
used the product; however, persons who did not use the product also
were affected. The product was sprayed indoors in 131 (87 percent) of
150 cases; 19 (13 percent) of the patients were exposed when the
product was used outdoors. No evidence was observed that substance
abuse was related to the exposures. Investigators determined that
sprayed shoes and boots brought into the home from garages or
outdoors continued to be a source of exposure to both humans and pets
as the product evaporated. Occupational exposures accounted for 5
cases, 4 while spraying clothing items at work and 1 while
demonstrating a product to a customer. Preexisting respiratory risk
factors were identified in 40 (27 percent) of the 150 patients:
asthma (13 [8 percent]) and smoking (27 [18 percent]).

A total of 144 patients were symptomatic, including 137 (95 percent)
who reported symptoms of respiratory illness; all were encouraged to
seek medical care. Among those who were symptomatic, the most common
symptoms were cough [(113 patients [78 percent])] and dyspnea [(86
[60 percent])]. Eighty (56 percent) were known to have been evaluated
in hospitals or hospital emergency departments, including 15 (10
percent) who were admitted and had hospital stays of up to 5 days.
Pulse oximetry of patients evaluated in hospitals ranged from 61
percent to 100 percent (median: 94.9 percent). Chest radiographs were
positive for infiltrates in 13 of 47 patients for whom this finding
was recorded. Eight patients met the case definition for chemical
pneumonitis (i.e., bilateral infiltrates suggestive of chemical
pneumonitis and pulse oximetry less than 95 percent on room air). One
person lost consciousness and was in respiratory distress, but
recovered; no human patient died.
Among 134 persons whose treatment was known, treatment consisted of
bronchodilators alone in 28 (21 percent) patients, bronchodilators
plus corticosteroids in 13 (10 percent) patients, and no intervention
other than oxygen in 69 (51 percent) patients. The duration of
illness was determined on the basis of last follow-up and ranged from
0.25-360 hours (median: 17.6 hours) in 116 patients for whom duration
could be evaluated.
Among the 19 pets with illness, 4 were evaluated by veterinarians.
Reported symptoms for the animals included dyspnea (13 [68 percent]),
cough (3), and vomiting (3). Chest radiographs were positive for
infiltrates in one animal, and one cat met the case definition for
chemical pneumonitis. Treatment included bronchodilators in one
animal, corticosteroids in one animal, diuretics with
anti-inflammatory agent in one animal, and no treatment other than
oxygen and supportive care in 12 (8 percent) animals. Two cats died
from respiratory failure.
There were 2 products primarily associated with the 150 cases of
human illness, both manufactured by Assured Packaging (Mississauga,
Ontario, Canada) and distributed by the Manakey Group LLC (Grand
Rapids, Michigan). Use of Jobsite Heavy Duty Bootmate was cited by
patients in 126 (84 percent) cases. Rocky Boot Weather and Stain
Protector was named in 7 (5 percent) cases. The 2 Assured Packaging
products consist of 45 percent heptane, 20 percent-30 percent
petroleum distillates, 25 percent-30 percent isobutane propellant, 5
percent-10 percent propane propellant, 0.33 percent fluoropolymer,
and 0.33 percent silicone.
Neither the product labels nor the material safety data sheets for
the products list fluoropolymer or silicone. Previous outbreaks of
acute pulmonary illness associated with exposure to waterproofing
agents have implicated fluoropolymer/hydrocarbon-based products (1-4).
The Consumer Product Safety Commission is evaluating these exposures
and boot sealant products. Local health departments and emergency
departments were alerted to report cases to their regional poison
centers. The American Association of Poison Control Centers has
instituted 13 new product codes and 3 new generic codes for
waterproofing agents to enable all poison centers to conduct
surveillance on exposures more readily. On 3 Jan 2006, at the
request of the Michigan Department of Community Health, Manakey Group
issued a recall of Jobsite Heavy Duty Bootmate and Rocky Boot Weather
and Stain Protector from store shelves, but not from consumers'
homes. During January-February 2006, 22 additional exposures were
reported to the 6 regional poison centers. Among callers asked, all
purchased the product before the recall date. No product defect has
been identified. Consumers should be encouraged to use all products
for waterproofing shoes and boots as directed, to apply them
outdoors, and to leave the sprayed shoes and boots and any
contaminated clothing outdoors until all fumes have dissipated.

[The fluoropolymer/hydrocarbons have been cited previously as causing
problems. It appears that the propellants for the waterproofing may
be hazardous. Often products containing these agents have a warning
that they should be used on in a well-ventilated area. Another issue
may be footware off-gasing. Perhaps these spray water-proofing agents
should specify that treated products should be left in a
well-ventilated area, out of reach of pets or children for some
specified period of time. - Mod.TG]
