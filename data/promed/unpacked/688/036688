----------------------------------------------------------------------
There are now 18 cases currently associated with the outbreak:
- 15 are PCR positive; 2 have arrived at VIDRL [Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory] (PCR pending); 1 specimen in transit;
- 11 are 100 percent identical to each other by molecular typing; the remainder have typing pending.

8 of the 18 identify as MSM [men who have sex with men], some of whom have visited sex on premises venues [SOPVs] during their incubation and/or infectious periods. We are working with ACON (AIDS Council of NSW) and partners to encourage vaccination of people who identify as MSM, and inform SOPVs of the outbreak.

A media alert was also issued this afternoon [14 Sep 2017], and distributed through LGTBI media channels.
