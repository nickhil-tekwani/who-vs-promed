More than a dozen Muscovy ducks have died in a Devon town from a disease called duck viral enteritis, also known as duck plague. The disease, found in the ducks at Buckfastleigh, is highly infectious among ducks and geese.

A spokesperson from the Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency (AHVLA) said the disease does not affect human health. Residents in the area had initially feared the ducks had been poisoned. Pam Barrett, one of those who looks after the ducks, said: "It's quite an unusual virus. "It can be carried by different wild fowl, but only ducks and geese get it, and Muscovies are particularly prone."

In a statement the AHVLA said: "We conducted a postmortem examination on a Muscovy duck from the Buckfastleigh area. The examination indicated duck viral enteritis and this was subsequently confirmed by histopathology."

[Duck viral enteritis is an acute disease caused by a herpesvirus that infects Anseriformes (ducks, geese, and swan). It is characterized by vascular damage, tissue hemorrhages, digestive mucosal eruptions, lesion of lymphoid organs, and degenerative changes in parenchymatous organs.

The Muscovy duck (_Cairina moschata_) is a large duck species native to the Neotropical region (see picture at http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/Cairina_moschata_-Texas_-USA-8.jpg). It was domesticated by the pre-Columbian native Americans and introduced to Europe by European explorers in the 16th century. Feral populations of Muscovy ducks are currently found in some parts of Europe.

The affected population lives on the Orchard Millennium Green at Buckfastleigh, Devon town (http://www.thisiscornwall.co.uk/Duck-plague-blamed-bird-deaths-town-park/story-19087977-detail/story.html#axzz2UURslWTB).
