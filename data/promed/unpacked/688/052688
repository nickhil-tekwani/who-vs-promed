[The diagnosis has been made on the basis of clinical signs without laboratory involvement.

Sheep pox and goat pox are viral diseases of sheep and goats characterised by fever, generalised papules or nodules, vesicles (rarely), internal lesions (particularly in the lungs), and death. Both diseases are caused by strains of capripoxvirus. Most of the strains cause clinical disease in either sheep or goats; some strains will cause a clinical disease in both species (such as in Kenya).

Sheep pox has been regarded endemic in Israel for many years. The local virus affects -- clinically -- sheep only: when the disease affects mixed sheep and goats flocks, only sheep are clinically affected. Mortality in adult animals is generally low (less than 5 per cent) but may reach high levels in offspring.

Since 2006, a new, imported vaccine has been introduced, and vaccination of sheep became compulsory in Israel; this led to a sharp decrease in the number of outbreaks: 2006 - 26; 2007 - 9; 2008 - 4; 2009 - 0; 2010 - 0; 2011 - 2; 2012 - 0; 2013 - 0; 2014 - 2. A graph showing the annual number of sheep pox outbreaks in Israel for the period 1990-2013 is available on page 30 of the VSAH (Veterinary Services and Animal Health) annual report 2013, available at http://www.moag.gov.il/agri/files/doch_shnati_2013.pdf.

Vaccination history of the infected flock described in the current OIE report, including the vaccine batch applied (in case vaccinated), would be welcome.

"Hadarom" (district) stands for "South" in the Hebrew language. The Houra municipality (more than 18 000 citizens) is a settlement established 1989 to provide solid housing for the populations of 6 bedouin tribes, settled north-east of Beer Sheva. - Mod.AS
