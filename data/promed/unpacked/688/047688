[These 12 outbreaks are not only fairly substantial in number but
cover a wide geographic swath of Bangladesh from northwest to
southeast. Again, it is important to remember that in countries where
the disease still circulates, we are not done with H5N1 Avian
Influenza. For that matter, vigilant surveillance should be maintain
in areas around the world where it the disease formerly was prevalent
but no recent outbreaks have been occurring.
