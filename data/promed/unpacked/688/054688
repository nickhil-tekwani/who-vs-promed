[By noting the EU number of cumulative cases of HUS and non-HUS cases
and their total as well as deaths, the daily rise of the numbers can
be seen:

Date (2011): New HUS / New non-HUS / New Total / Overall Total
Deaths
Mon 6 Jun: 3 / 67 / 70 / 22
Tue 7 Jun: 13 / 83 / 96 / 23
Wed 8 Jun: 48 / 266 / 314 / 25
Thu 9 Jun: 35 / 121 / 156 / 27
Fri 10 Jun: 38 / 115 / 153 / 31
Sat 11 Jun: 14 / 177 / 191 / 35
Sun 12 Jun: 0 / 40 / 40 / 35
Mon 13 Jun: 8 / 34 / 42 / 36
Tue 14 Jun: 1 / 6 / 7 / 36
Wed 15 Jun: 3 / 17 / 20 / 37
Thu 16 Jun: 2 / 48 / 50 / 39
Fri 17 Jun: 14 / 92 / 106 / 39
Mon 20 Jun: 12 / 74 / 96 / 40
Tue 21 Jun: 4 / 89 / 93 / 40

[The cases do not necessarily reflect date of onset of disease but
rather when the diagnosis was made and reported. The number of newly
reported cases per day clearly decreased from the corresponding day in
the previous week. - Mod.LL]

[2] WHO update
Date: Mon 20 Jun 2011
Source: EHO [edited]
http://www.euro.who.int/en/what-we-do/health-topics/emergencies/international-health-regulations/news/news/2011/06/ehec-outbreak-update-19


For more than 10 days, the number of reported cases of hemolytic
uremic syndrome (HUS)/enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC) has declined
significantly. In Germany, the daily numbers of reported cases have
steadily decreased since they peaked, on 21 May 2011 for HUS and on 22
and 23 May 2011 for EHEC. Nevertheless, the cumulative numbers of
cases from Germany continue to rise, primarily owing to delays in
notification.

Investigations by the German authorities indicate that the vehicle of
the bacterium responsible for the outbreak, enteroaggregative
verocytotoxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ (EAggEC VTEC) O104:H4, is
bean and seed sprouts, and the Robert Koch Institute has warned people
in Germany not to eat raw bean and seed sprouts of any origin.

Note: There are 3604 HUS and EHEC cases in total, including 40
fatalities. The latest date of onset of diarrhea for a HUS case is 12
Jun 2011 and for an EHEC case, 13 Jun 2011. All but 5 of the above HUS
and EHEC cases were in people who had traveled to or lived in Germany
during the incubation period for infection, typically 3-4 days after
exposure (range: 2-10 days). The remaining 5 cases can also be linked
to the outbreak in Germany.

EHEC and HUS have exclusive notification categories, so case numbers
should not overlap. The figures in any rapidly evolving outbreak,
however, are provisional and subject to change for a variety of
reasons.
