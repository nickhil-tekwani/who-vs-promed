LETHAL YELLOWING, COCONUT PALM - MOZAMBIQUE

Coconuts and coconut products form an important part of the economy
in Northern Mozambique. However, outbreaks of coconut lethal
yellowing disease (CLYD) now threaten the industry and the livelihood
of over 1.7 million people in Zambezia and Nampula Provinces. At the
present rate of spread, more than 50 percent of the coconut area is
likely to be lost over the next 9 years. Affected trees cease
producing and threaten the productivity of healthy trees; therefore,
they must be removed and replaced.
The objective of the Farmer Income Support Project is to reduce the
spread of CLYD, and to improve productivity of coconut products and
encourage diversification into other cash-crop production. This
project will eliminate biological and technical barriers that hinder
economic growth among farms and targeted enterprises while supporting
diversification into other cash crops and improved farming practices
to assist smallholders and producers recover lost income. In
conjunction with tree removal and replacement, this activity will
assist farmers in adopting new cropping systems and developing
alternative sources of cash income during the time required for new
coconut trees to reach productive age. This component will also
provide technical support to introduce better practices aimed at
increasing crop yields.

[Coconut palm is a vitally important subsistence and cash crop in
many poor regions, so much so that it is often called the 'Tree of
Life'. Lethal yellowing (LY) is caused by _Candidatus_ Phytoplasma
palmae (a bacterial intra-cellular plant parasite), which can infect
a large number of palm species. It has seriously jeopardised coconut
industries in affected areas and is spreading in the Americas and
parts of Africa. Transmission is thought to occur by the planthopper
_Myndus crudus_, but seed-transmission cannot be excluded. Symptoms
may be suppressed by tetracycline, but commercial control of LY is
primarily being achieved by replanting with resistant varieties such
as Malayan Dwarfs (see recent ProMED-mail post 20070522.1643)
In Mozambique, LY has been spreading continuously in the coastal
coconut belt to the north and south of Quelimane. Nevertheless,
substantial areas still remain free of the disease including the
Malayan Dwarf seed garden at Macuse. At least 2 new districts have
been affected since 2000, and there are many new foci in previously
affected districts. Quarantine measures including roadside
checkpoints are in place to restrict movement of coconut planting
materials from north to south.
