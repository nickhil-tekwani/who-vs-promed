In summer 2002, maize (_Zea mays_ L.) crops in northern Greece (Macedonia),
showed severe dwarfing, reduced corn cob size and in some cases leaf
reddening. These symptoms were different from those caused by Maize dwarf
mosaic virus, which is endemic in maize crops in Macedonia.
The dwarfing disease was only epidemic in 2002 and in some maize growing
regions (Imathia and Serres), where crop losses were estimated to be over
70 percent. In contrast, in 2003 only a few cases were recorded.
Symptoms were similar to those caused by 2 closely related members of the
genus Fijivirus, Maize rough dwarf virus (MRDV), and Rice black-streaked
dwarf virus (RBSDV) (Azuhata et al., 1993). The putative virus could not be
transmitted mechanically from maize to maize or to other indicator plants.
An RT-PCR was developed and optimised for the detection of both MRDV and
RBSDV. 2 primers ('MRDV-F1': 5'-AGCGGAGAACGTTtggatc-3' and 'MRDV-R2': 5'
-ttaacaacagcagcttcacc-3') were designed from highly conserved regions
within both viral genomes (segment 8 from MRDV and 9 from RBSDV).
Total RNA was extracted, denatured at 95 C in the presence of 1 micromole
of primer 'MRDV-R2' and 10 percent DMSO, before being used as template for
RT. RT and subsequent PCR were performed according to standard protocols
(Dovas et al., 2001) with an annealing temperature of 60 C used in PCR.
RT-PCR using total RNA from 15 plants showing typical dwarfing symptoms
gave the expected 568 bp product, which was subsequently cloned and
sequenced. Sequence comparisons revealed 96 percent identity with genome
segment 8 of an Italian isolate of MRDV (L76561) (Marzachi et al., 1996),
whereas identity with genome segment 9 of two RBSDV isolates from China
(AF459812, AY050486) was 85 percent (Bai et al., 2002).
The presence of MRDV was further confirmed by ELISA using polyclonal
antibodies (BioRad Phyto-Diagnostics, France). More than 50 samples
collected from Imathia and Serres area, showing MRDV symptoms tested
positive by ELISA.
This is the first report of MRDV in Greece.

[MRDV was first reported in _Zea mays_ from Israel in 1959. It is spreading
in Argentina, the former Czechoslovakia, France, Israel, Italy, Norway,
Spain, Sweden, and the former Yugoslavia. Susceptible hosts include oat
(_Avena sativa_), barley (_Hordeum vulgare_) and several grasses. The virus
is transmitted by several leafhoppers including _Delphacodes propinqua_,
_Dicranotropis hamata_, _Laodelphax triatellus_ and others in the family
_Delphacidae_. Maize seedlings infected at early stages produce almost no
seeds. MRDV is related to several other fijiviruses (Rice black-streaked
dwarf [RBSDV], Pangola stunt [PaSV], Mal de Rio Cuarto [MRCV]), although
MRCV has been suggested as a distinct virus species. RBSDV commonly infects
maize in China. A virus considered to similar to MCRV was reported from
maize in India in 2001, but I don't know whether that report has been
confirmed. Can any of our Indian colleagues provide information on this
point? -Mod.DH]
