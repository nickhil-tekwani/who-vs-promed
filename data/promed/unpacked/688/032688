Epidemiological comments:
On 12 Nov [2012], after being informed, a team from the Poultry Unit went immediately to the community and found, according to the population, that 280 birds had gradually died in 6 days in 2 communities. The same day, blood samples were taken and sent to the Central Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory for analysis. Also, the team went to the neighbouring community Palo Quemado, where blood samples were taken; a post-mortem inspection was carried out in 4 slaughtered birds, and organ and tissue samples were taken to be sent to the Central Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. Later, on 20 Nov [2012], animal health services launched a campaign of vaccination against Newcastle disease in both communities as well as in communities around the outbreak; 4185 out of 4839 birds were vaccinated in the 7 communities. It is worth mentioning that after the vaccination was applied, no other mortality has been observed in birds in the communities. Currently, epidemiological surveillance continues in all communities of the affected municipality and in the zone around the outbreak, as well as in the buffer zone.

[While reports of Newcastle disease in Central American poultry are sparse, OIE has it absent from Central America from January to June 2012 and only "suspected" in Belize and Nicaragua in 2011. This is the 1st report for later in 2012.

As vaccination merely suppresses the signs of this disease while the birds are still shedding virus, albeit at a lower level, I think we can assume it is quietly around and unobserved. If you go to the OIE website, you will see that this affected area is close to the PanAmerican Highway. It is a traveling disease, if not in birds, in dirty cages. - Mod.MHJ
