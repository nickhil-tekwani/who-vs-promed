The Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported on [Fri 20 Apr 2018] that the Georgia Department of Agriculture (GDA) confirmed a case of equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) in a Miniature mule residing in Cherokee County.

The positive test result came in on [Tue 17 Apr 2018]. The mule exhibited mild respiratory clinical signs and ultimately died due to pneumonia complications, the EDCC said. "(The) GDA has placed the facility under quarantine," the EDCC's statement said. "Other equids possibly having come into contact with the affected mule are being monitored and are currently not showing clinical signs of the disease."

Herpesvirus is highly contagious and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (the neurologic form). In many equids, the only sign of EHV-1 infection is fever, which can go undetected.

In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young stock include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months) but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Equids with the neurologic form usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore- and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

The California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) reported that 2 additional horses residing at the Orange County facility quarantined for equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) tested positive for the disease last week.

"A mare displayed a fever the morning of [17 Apr 2018] and a horse which was febrile for one day on [Sun 8 Apr 2018]," have tested positive, the CDFA said on its website. "Both horses have been placed in separate quarantine isolation stabling on the property. All exposed horses under quarantine continue to be monitored and have temperatures taken 2 times daily."

The index case -- a 17-year-old Thoroughbred gelding that was diagnosed with equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM, the neurologic form of EHV-1) after developing neurologic signs of disease -- remains quarantined and isolated offsite and continues to show clinical improvements, the CDFA said.

As of [22 Apr 2018], no additional EHV-1 cases have been confirmed, according to the CDFA.

Veterinarians have confirmed equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM, the neurologic form of equine herpesvirus-1, or EHV-1) in a well-known Bowman County barrel racing horse.

The horse developed signs of disease on [Thu 19 Apr 2018]. The disease progressed rapidly, and the veterinarians euthanized the horse the same day. Confirmatory lab results were received [Fri 20 Apr 2018] evening, the North Dakota Department of Agriculture said in a [Mon 23 Apr 2018] statement.

Horses exposed to the positive horse within 72 hours prior to the onset of clinical illness have been quarantined. Owners of other horses that might have had contact with the affected horse prior to that period are being advised to consult with their local veterinarian, monitor their horses for signs of disease, and restrict travel.

Vaccines are available for the respiratory and reproductive forms of EHV-1. They do not reliably protect against EHM, but might offer some level of protection.

"With summer coming, many horses will be moving to events around the region," said State Veterinarian Susan Keller, DVM. "Care should be taken when commingling horses to minimize the chances of contracting the disease."

Equine herpesvirus can spread through the air, contaminated equipment, clothing, and hands. Biosecurity measures that can reduce the risk of spreading the disease include avoiding shared food or water containers and preventing nose-to-nose contact.

Out-of-state horses and other equines entering North Dakota for any length of time must be accompanied by a certificate of veterinary inspection. "Certificates of veterinary inspection reduce the risk of introduction of clinical disease and help us better monitor the movement of equines into North Dakota," said Keller. "We use that information to report disease risks and findings to veterinarians and horse owners in North Dakota."

[As these articles have stated, EHV is highly contagious and there is currently no vaccine to protect against the neurological form. For any equine groups, USDA, university researchers and pharmaceutical and /or biological companies needing a project this seems like a worthy cause for which all horse owners would be grateful. Hopefully we will have a vaccine sooner rather than later.

One of these articles mentioned other horses potentially exposed were having their temperature monitored 2x daily. This is very important as a slight rise in body temperature may be the earliest and sometimes the only sign of this disease in the early stages. - Mod.TG
