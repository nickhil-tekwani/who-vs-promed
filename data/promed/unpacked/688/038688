[These are not official data. They are derived, with some editing, from the
above-mentioned source, which seems to be updated meticulously. The data
from some countries may include exceptional imported cases or exclude
exported cases which were found positive in the countries of destination.
During 2003, decreased incidence of recorded BSE cases, compared to 2002,
was seen in most countries. The exceptions were Portugal, Spain, Japan,
Poland, and the Czech Republic.
The number of BSE cases in Germany seems to be increasing in 2004 after a
steep decline during 2003. In the first quarter of 2004, Germany counted 14
cases; in the same period of 2003 the number of confirmed cases was only 7.
In 2002, Germany had 39 confirmed cases during the first 3 months.
Remarkable is the fact that the German cases are relatively young: half of
the confirmed cases so far in 2004 were born in 1999 or 2000.
Since the previous update (23 Feb 2004), one new case was observed in Japan
and Slovenia (each). Poland has observed 2 new cases: according to an AFP
report of 27 Mar 2004, a 13th BSE case was discovered there "during a
routine test at a slaughterhouse". This new case is not included in the
above table.

BSE Cases In Europe Fall By 38 percent
-------------------------------------------------
Overall, the number of BSE cases in current EU Member States has fallen by
about 38 percent in 2003 compared to 2002, according to the European
Commission.
5 of the current Member States -- Greece, Luxembourg, Austria, Finland and
Sweden -- have not reported BSE in 2003.
Courtesy of BSE testing, around 10 million bovine animals have been
analyzed in the 15 current Member States, and about 700 000 analyses have
been reported from 7 new Member States.
So far, 1318 BSE cases were detected in the current Member States during
2003 and 12 in 4 new Member States.
In the accession negotiations, all new Member States have made commitments
to fully transpose and implement the TSE legislation at the latest by
accession (1 May 2004).
As in other fields, these commitments need to be monitored.
The Food and Veterinary Office has carried out 2 series of BSE inspections
in all new Member States.
The final reports and the general report of the first series have been
distributed to the Member States.
In all countries, BSE measures have been progressively implemented, but
important gaps in certain areas still remain in some countries.
Routine rapid BSE testing has been introduced on a wide scale in most new
Member States, and the rest should start on 1 May 2004.
All countries test animals in risk groups (emergency slaughtered, fallen
stock), although this testing is still not sufficient in many of them.
All new Member States are removing SRMs, and total feed bans are now in
place in all of them.
4 new Member States have now reported BSE. In the Czech Republic, there
have been 9 cases since Jun 2001; in Slovakia, 13 cases since Sep 2001; in
Slovenia, 3 cases since Nov 2001; and in Poland, 11 cases since May 2002.

Canadian BSE triggered by feed
--------------------------------------
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is blaming pre-feed ban ruminant meat
or bone meal exposure as the source of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or
mad cow disease. The investigation included trace-back, trace-forward, and
feed investigations that spanned 4 provinces and included some 2700 animals.
The agency's feed investigation was designed to identify all feeds that the
index case consumed and determine whether any contained ruminant meat and
bone meal.
Feeding of ruminant meat and bone meal to ruminants is believed to be the
most likely means of transmission of BSE. Regulations now prohibit this
practice in Canada.
The on-farm investigation of the birth herd identified 2 feeds of interest,
a dairy ration and a protein supplement.
Review of the feed mill inspection records indicated that the feed mill
that produced the dairy ration had a good Health of Animals Act compliance
history. The feed mill's formula showed that ruminant meat and bone meal
was used in the ration until Jul 1997 and discontinued when the Canadian
feed ban was implemented in Aug 1997.
It was unlikely that the protein supplement was the source of exposure,
since it would probably have been consumed before the index case had access.
The feed investigation concluded that meat and bone meal exposure, through
feed, occurred prior to implementation of the Canadian feed ban.
The agency's animal investigation was designed to determine the herd of
origin of the BSE-positive cow found in Washington state.
Through the Canadian health of animals ear tag, herd and registration
records, it was determined that the animal was born 9 Apr 1997 on a farm in
Alberta. The herd records identified the index case's sire, dam, and
Canadian-born calves. Neither the dam nor the Canadian-born calves were
located in Canada.
The DNA of the brain of the index case, its hide (located by Canadian
investigators working in Washington State with their U.S. counterparts),
semen from its sire, and DNA of one its offspring (born in the US) were
compared. The results confirmed the identification of the animal.
The infected cow was part of a herd of 113 dairy animals that was
dispersed. 17 were moved in Sep 2001 to multiple destinations; one went to
auction; 3 were slaughtered for the owner's use; 11 went to a dairy farm;
and 81, including the index case, were exported in Sep 2001 to a
heifer-breeding operation in Washington State.
At the heifer breeding operation, 3 animals were kept, 8 animals were moved
to a heifer-raising operation in Washington State, and 70 animals,
including the index case, were moved to Mabton, Washington, where the case
of BSE was found.
In total, 12 animals were destroyed and tested in Canada, and test results
for all 12 were negative for BSE.
In the May 2003 BSE case, approximately 2700 animals from the
investigations in Alberta and Saskatchewan were destroyed.
