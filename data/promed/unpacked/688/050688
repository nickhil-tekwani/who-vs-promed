2 more cases of plague reported
-------------------------------
A cat that made a meal out of a squirrel likely contracted the plague
from its prey, health officials said on Thu 16 Feb 2006. The domestic
cat and the white-tailed antelope squirrel both tested positive for
plague this week, said Steve DeFeyter, director of environmental
health for the Mesa County Health Department.
This new plague report comes a week after the plague was found in 2
chipmunks on Colorado National Monument, resulting in the closing of
the Saddlehorn Campground. "It is odd and puzzling to have plague
activity this early in the year," DeFeyter said.
April is the earliest DeFeyter said he expected to see plague
activity. Rodents are usually in hibernation this time of year, he
said. From what he has seen on the monument and in the Redlands area,
"as far as I can tell, there's a lot of rodent activity going on," he
said.
"I'm confident that the unseasonably warm weather, spring weather,
that we've had ... is a factor in us seeing activity this early,"
DeFeyter said.
In 2005, the 1st case of plague was reported in May in a woman from
Gateway. It was later found in rodents and several cats.
With the recent plague-positive tests, "I would consider the entire
Redlands from Kingsview (Road) clear to the Gunnison River an area of
concern," DeFeyter said.
Saddlehorn Campground remains closed, and the National Park Service
is in the process of assessing the plague risk in the area and doing
follow-up studies, DeFeyter said. "They're concerned about it. We're
concerned about it," DeFeyter said. "It could be that there has been
an outbreak of plague in the animals up there."
The domestic cat that most recently tested positive for the plague is
alive and being treated, he said. The cat apparently brought home the
plague-infected squirrel after catching it, said Dr. Michael
Aduddell, director of the Health Department.
It is one of 2 cats in this particular Redlands household, and the
other cat is also being tested for the plague. Those results are
pending. DeFeyter said, "It wouldn't surprise me if it came out
positive too."
Plague is transmitted through the bite of a flea infected with the
plague bacteria. Ground squirrels, prairie dogs and rabbits are
common hosts for infected fleas, the Health Department said. Plague
may be transmitted to people by bites from infected fleas, by
handling the carcasses of infected animals, or by scratches or bites
from infected domestic cats, the Health Department continued.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Schountz for the contribution. It is disconcerting
that feral animal plague is occurring this early in the year. The
mild winter presumably resulted in less winter die-off of the rodents
and shorter hibernation cycles of those that hibernate. - Mod.LL]
