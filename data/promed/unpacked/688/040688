Toddler tests negative for bird flu
--------------------------------------------------------
A 2-year-old girl who is a neighbor of Bali's 1st and only confirmed
bird flu victim is not infected with the H5N1 bird flu virus, the
Ministry of Health confirmed today [16 Aug 2007]. The 2-year-old girl
lives in the same village in Jembrana District, Bali, as a
29-year-old woman who died from avian influenza on 12 Aug 2007. The
child became ill on 10 Aug 2007 with symptoms of fever and a runny
nose and samples were taken for testing as a precaution; however
testing at 2 laboratories in Jakarta have confirmed that the girl
does not carry the H5N1 virus. [As reported previously] another
child, the 5-year-old daughter of the 29-year-old victim, died on 4
Aug 2007, but samples were not taken for testing.
Investigators have determined that both children were exposed to
H5N1-positive birds in the area. Authorities supported by the United
Nations are undertaking activities to contain the outbreak, including
the mass culling of birds in the area and social mobilization
activities to improve public awareness about bird flu.
Until now, sick birds remain the primary source of human infection
with the H5N1 virus. There are steps everyone can take to reduce the
risk of infection with H5N1 influenza. Don't touch sick or dead
chickens. If you have had contact with sick or dead chickens,
promptly wash your hands with soap and report the incident to your
village head. Wash your hands and cooking appliances with soap before
cooking. Cook chicken and eggs well.
Separate poultry from humans. And also separate new poultry from
existing poultry flocks for 2 weeks. Go to a Public Health Center or
Hospital immediately if you have flu and fever symptoms after having
contact with poultry/chicken.

[ProMED-mail commented previously (see: Avian influenza, human (121):
Indonesia (Bali), WHO 20070814.2654) that neither the Indonesia
Ministry of Heath nor the World Health Organisation had confirmed the
report that a 2-year-old girl who was a neighbor of H5N1-infected
woman on Bali had contracted avian influenza. We are reassured to
have this verified. - Mod.CP]
