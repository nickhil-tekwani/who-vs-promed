Cholera kills 4, hundreds affected in Maryland, Grand Kru counties
-----------------------------------------------
A severe outbreak of cholera has claimed the lives of at least 4 persons,
while about 435 others were reportedly affected by the epidemic in the
Southeastern Liberian counties of Maryland and Grand Kru. Merlin's Clinical
Supervisor in Maryland County, Ayeason Yeeba, confirmed news of the
outbreak in the 2 counties and said that 121 cholera cases were treated
between the period 11-30 Jun 2004 at the J.J. Dossen Hospital and other
health centers in Maryland County.
During this period, according to Mr. Yeeba, one death (a 13-year-old
female) was reported. 118 cholera patients were treated, and subsequently
discharged, in July 2004, while 60 cases were treated, with at least 2
deaths reported during this period. The victims were males under 5 years of
age. Mr. Yeeba also disclosed that 136 cases were treated in September 2004
alone, with the death of a 60-year-old female recorded, bringing the number
of deaths to 4 so far. [The number of cases treated in each time period is
unclear from this newswire, but the "gist" of this article is that there
have been 4 deaths and approximately 435 cases attributable to cholera
reported from Maryland and Grand Kru counties. More information from
knowledgeable sources to clarify this would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]

Cholera in Senegal
------------------
WHO has received reports from the Ministry of Health of a total number of
128 cases and 2 deaths (case fatality rate, 1.6 percent) from 5 Oct - 28
Oct 2004 in Dakar. _Vibrio cholerae_ 01 El Tor has been confirmed by the
National Reference Laboratory, Senegal.
The number of cases has risen sharply since the beginning of the outbreak,
and, on 22 Oct 2004, the Ministry of Health declared an epidemic of cholera.
A National Outbreak Management Committee has been established to monitor
and carry out comprehensive control measures in response to the outbreak.
Physicians and health workers in the affected districts of the city have
been alerted and provided with technical guidance; health education
materials on good hygiene have been distributed; social mobilization
activities targeted particularly at children and women have been carried
out; and unsanitary areas have been decontaminated.

Senegal Cholera epidemic spreads to 400
-----------------------------------------
A cholera epidemic in Dakar, the capital of this West African nation, was
spreading on Tuesday [2 Nov 2004], with 400 cases reported, and 2 deaths so
far, health officials said. The figure is up from 84 cases reported on 26
Oct 2004. The 1st case was diagnosed 11 Oct 2004.
While more cases are expected, doctors were optimistic about checking the
spread of the waterborne disease soon.
"This is the normal evolution of an epidemic...the preventive measures we
are currently taking will help us reduce the speed at which the disease is
spreading," Dr. Papa Salif Sow, head of infectious diseases at Dakar's Fann
teaching hospital, told The Associated Press.
The epidemic is still mainly present in the capital, Dakar. 2 cases have
been reported in Bambey, 123 km (76 miles) north of Dakar, Sow said.
The last cholera outbreak in Senegal, in 1996, killed 201 people.

Fresh cholera outbreak in Zambia
---------------------------------
A new wave of Cholera broke out in Lusaka, the capital of Zambia, 8 months
after health authorities said a previous outbreak had been contained. The
latest outbreak was reported in the densely populated Chaisa area, in the
northern outskirts of the city.
Victor Mukonka, spokesperson for the Central Board of Health, gave
confirmation in an interview on Tue 2 Nov 2004, saying that an infected
woman was treated and discharged from a local clinic. He warned the disease
could spread quickly unless Lusaka residents took necessary precautions,
including observing high standards of hygiene.
The Health Ministry said that by February 2004, Zambia had reported some
3835 cholera cases, including 179 deaths.
Health NGO Medecins Sans Frontieres-Spain (Doctors without Borders) and the
WHO helped to bring that epidemic under control. However, last month
[October 2004], the Central Statistical Office warned of a high diarrhea
prevalence of 21 percent among children under the age of 5.

[5] Cholera - African Continent

Cholera outbreaks have hit 3 more African countries, bringing the number of
people killed by the disease across the continent this year [2004] to 1663,
health officials said on Wed 3 Nov 2004.
Some 71 600 cases have been reported in Africa since January 2004, and
Cameroon, Chad, and Mali have been particularly badly affected, according
to Claire-Lise Chaignat, coordinator of the WHO global cholera task force.
"Most of Africa is at high risk, but you always have pockets that are more
at risk, the poorest of the poor," Chaignat told Reuters by telephone from
Geneva. In 2003, there were 108 000 cases, and 1884 deaths, she said.
Senegal, and neighboring Guinea-Bissau on West Africa's Atlantic coast, and
Uganda in the east, are the latest countries to succumb to the disease.
Africa had been free of cholera, an intestinal infection spread by
contaminated water and food, for more than a century, when the disease hit
western regions in 1970. It quickly spread and became endemic across much
of the continent, killing hundreds of people each year.
The 1st outbreak of cholera in 7 years in Senegal's capital, Dakar, led
President Abdoulaye Wade and cabinet members to wash their hands on state
television last Thu 28 Nov 2004, to encourage people to fight the spread of
the disease. There have been a total of 400 reported cases, 4 of them fatal.
Guinea-Bissau said, on Mon 1 Nov 2004, that cholera had killed 3 people and
infected 58 others on the Bijagos archipelago off its Atlantic coast. The
government blamed fisherman from neighboring countries for spreading the
disease.
"No cases have yet been recorded in the capital, Bissau. We are working to
make sure it doesn't spread across the country," health ministry official
Julio S. Nogueira said.
In northern Uganda, aid workers are battling an outbreak, at a camp for
displaced persons, that has killed 3 people and infected at least 79
others, according to UN officials.
In Chad, one of the world's poorest countries, cholera has killed 229
people and infected 4719 this year [2004]. Aid workers fear the disease
could spread to camps in the east, which house refugees from Sudan's
neighboring Darfur region.
Torrential rains in Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown, triggered an outbreak
in the city's shanty towns that later spread and killed 54 people in August
2004 alone.
Many of those who die from cholera could have been saved by a simple
mixture of water and rehydration salts, but many remote areas lack even the
most basic facilities, and in some, the security situation makes access for
health workers difficult.
"In theory, it is simple, but to apply it in practice is more difficult.
People die because they cannot get access to rehydration," WHO's Chaignat said.

Taiwan issues Asia dysentery alert
---------------------------------
Taiwan's health officials reported, on Tue 2 Nov 2004, that 16 Taiwanese
travelers returning from Southeast Asia had bacterial dysentery in the past
month, and the government urged tourists to be more alert about the illness.
The Center for Disease Control said that 10 of the patients had visited
Indonesia, 3 had visited Thailand, and 3 had visited China.
During the 1st 10 months of the year [2004], the CDC reported a total 74
cases of bacterial dysentery, which can cause abdominal pain and diarrhea.
Most of the cases originated in Southeast Asia, the CDC said.
