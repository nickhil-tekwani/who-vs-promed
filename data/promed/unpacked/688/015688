Morocco rejects Northern Ireland potatoes
-----------------------------------------
Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) representatives
are due before their scrutiny committee over an international incident
in which potatoes exported from Northern Ireland were rejected for
being diseased.

In March 2010, 1000 tonnes of spuds had to be destroyed in the
Moroccan city of Nador. Moroccan government plant health officials
rejected the cargo from Warrenpoint amid claims the goods were
infected with the fungal disease silver scurf. Seed potatoes supplied
by Holland, France, and Scotland were also rejected.

Northern Ireland government inspectors had given the cargo the
thumbs-up before it set sail. Producers from the Ulster Potato
Association were subsequently issued with an ultimatum from Morocco --
take your spuds back or pay for them to be disposed of. They chose the
latter -- at a cost of around GBP 17 000 [about USD 27 000] -- but the
final bill, when loss of earnings is factored in, is estimated to be
in the region of GBP 500 000 [USD 788 000].

Agriculture committee chair Paul Frew said steps had to be taken to
ensure this could not happen again. "This was a hugely embarrassing
incident and we need to get to the bottom of it," he said. Northern
Ireland exports seed potatoes to many countries. The rejection of the
seed potatoes in Morocco had caused considerable problems for local
growers.

[Silver scurf of potato is caused by the fungus _Helminthosporium
solani_. Symptoms include small brown spots on tuber skins forming a
"scurf" which may appear silvery when wet. The scurf is often found
near the tuber's end and is confined to the surface. In storage,
symptoms may continue to develop and spread, and affected tubers may
show increased water loss and shrinkage resulting in lower weights.
Silver scurf may increase susceptibility of plants to secondary
infections and is suspected to decrease vigour of seed tubers. The
disease can cause substantial economic losses due to a lower market
value of disfigured tubers.

The pathogen is spread with infected tubers and soil, but survival
time in soil appears to be rather limited. Hence infected seed
potatoes are often the source of new outbreaks, and volunteer potatoes
may serve as pathogen reservoirs in a field. Disease management
requires an integrated approach and may include crop rotation with
non-host species of at least 2 years, fungicides as seed tuber
treatments, phytosanitary measures and appropriate storage and
handling procedures. Use of certified clean planting material is
essential. Biocontrol agents are being investigated. Little
information is available on the relative susceptibility of potato
varieties, but symptoms are less obvious in some cultivars (for
example in those with russet skins).
