An outbreak of anthrax has been observed close to Astrakhan. A total
of 185 people are under medical observation

The administration of Astrakhan Rosselkhoznadzor has informed the
correspondent of "Visota 102" that an anthrax outbreak has been
registered in neighboring West-Kazakhstan oblast. Cases of infection
have been found in the settlements of Volodarka in Zelenovski rayon
and of Akbulak in Burlinski rayon. The Ministry of Health of
Kazakhstan reports that 4 people contracted the infection and 185
more are under medical observation.

Causes of this outbreak are declared bad condition of some farms, and
the non-compliance of producers with sanitary, veterinary and
anti-epizootic regulations. The Astrakhan Rosselkhoznadzor keeps its
eyes open on the health status of residents and animal population in
bordering regions.

[For 4 human cases and 185 under observation it sounds like one dead
cow and a market shared by 2 villages, or at least 2 dead animals and
maybe separate villages. Either way a failure of veterinary oversight
in spite of the self serving claims blaming the local farmers. As I
have said before, when there are human cases of anthrax it is the
fault of the veterinarians, no one else. It appears to be the season
for sporadic outbreaks in western Kazakhstan.
