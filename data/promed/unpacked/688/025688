The Northwestern Health Unit is reporting an increase in cases of syphilis in its region, which stretches from the Manitoba border east to Pickle Lake and Atikokan. The region typically sees fewer than 5 cases a year of the disease, according to medical officer of health Dr Kit Young Hoon. So far, it's seen around 40 since last August [2018].

"People should be making an effort to protect themselves," Young Hoon told CBC, "so using condoms, using dental dams [latex or polyurethane sheets used between the mouth and vagina or anus during oral sex. - Mod.SH], and being aware of who you're having sex with." Syphilis is spread through sexual activity and contact with sores associated with the disease. The health unit is urging anyone who has had unprotected sex with a new partner to seek testing from the health unit or their health care provider. "People who have unprotected sex, individuals who have multiple sex partners, or people who might purchase or sell sex are at increased risk," Young Hoon said.

Symptoms of syphilis include sores on the mouth or genitals, rashes on the hands or feet, swollen glands, flu-like symptoms, and hair loss, she added. The disease is curable with antibiotics in its early stages, but left untreated, it can impact the heart, brain, liver, bones, and eyes, she said. Syphilis can also spread to a fetus, Young Hoon said, so pregnant women should be tested for the disease at about 28-32 weeks and also at delivery.

The outbreak of syphilis in the region is linked to a similar outbreak in Manitoba, Young Hoon said.

[The news report above says that an increase in syphilis is the Northwestern subregion of the Canadian province of Ontario ("from the Manitoba border east to Pickle Lake and Atikokan") is linked to a similar outbreak in Manitoba. Pickle Lake, a town of 388 residents in 2016, is 708 km (440 mi) north east of Winnipeg and Atikokan, a town of 2753 residents in 2016, is 555 km (345 mi) southeast of Winnipeg; Pickle Lake is about 460 km (286 mi) north of Atikokan -- a map of this area can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Pickle+Lake,+ON,+Canada/Atikokan,+Ontario,+Canada.

A recent ProMED-mail post linked an increased incidence of primary and secondary syphilis and congenital syphilis in the city of Winnipeg, Canada to the rise in injection drug (methamphetamine) use in Manitoba. Transmission of syphilis in injection drug users may occur as a consequence of sharing a needle/syringe contaminated with infected blood from somebody who has primary or secondary syphilis (https://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/archive/newsrel/health/04-28TransmissionSyphilis.asp), but more likely the infection is acquired by the practice of exchanging drugs for sex and high-risk sexual behaviors, such as multiple partners and inconsistent condom use (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9147154 and https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6806a4.htm).

The current linkage of illicit drug use and syphilis transmission in Canada is reminiscent of the increase in syphilis among heterosexuals during the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s, when the practice of trading sex with multiple partners for drugs, especially crack cocaine, played a major role in the transmission of syphilis. Under these circumstances, the identities of sex partners are often unknown, which weakens the traditional syphilis-control strategy of partner notification.

Winnipeg, with a population of over 700 000 residents in 2016, is the capital and largest city in the Canadian province of Manitoba (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg), approximately 110 km (70 mi) north of the Canada-United States border.
