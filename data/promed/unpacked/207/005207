Today [14 Apr 2022] China reported 29 317 new COVID-19 cases, which include 26 318 asymptomatic cases. Shanghai has 85.7% of the symptomatic cases and 95.5% of the asymptomatic cases, according to officials.

The latest numbers, which come as Shanghai's 26 million residents continue a 2-week-long lockdown, raise suspicion among COVID-19 experts. "There's simply no way what they are reporting is what is happening," said Michael Osterholm, PhD, MPH, who directs the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP), publisher of CIDRAP News.

The proportion of asymptomatic cases defies biological logic, he said, and to report that Shanghai's death toll is so low is a misrepresentation when Hong Kong currently has the highest per capita death rate in the world.

During a January to March [2022] surge in omicron cases, Hong Kong recorded 5906 COVID-19 deaths. That contrasts starkly with Shanghai, where health officials maintain that no residents have died during the omicron surge and only one case out of 250 000 recorded since 1 Mar 2022 required medical treatment.

"Why would no one be dying in mainland China?" Osterholm asked. "Unfortunately, this adds to the lack of trust in China's ability to report public health."

At the end of January [2022], Osterholm had said China's commitment to a zero-COVID policy was flawed in the face of omicron, which is too transmissible to contain with lockdowns and early pandemic mitigation strategies.

"Earlier efforts by China worked because they were containing a forest fire," Osterholm said. "But omicron is the wind. You can't contain the wind."

Earlier this week President Xi Jinping said his country was still committed to zero COVID, as videos of Shanghai residents screaming from their apartments surfaced on social media. Residents have posted online about severe food shortages in their city.

Today [14 Apr 2022] Pfizer and BioNTech announced new data that support authorizing a 3rd dose, or booster shot, of their mRNA vaccine for children ages 5-11.

The companies said a 3rd dose produced a 36-fold increase in neutralizing antibodies against the omicron variant and a 6-fold increase in neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 wild-type strain. The companies say they plan to submit a request for emergency use authorization (EUA) for a booster dose in this age-group to the Food and Drug Administration in the coming days.

The evidence comes from 140 participants in a phase 2/3 trial who received a 10-microgram booster dose (the same dose in the primary series) approximately 6 months after their 2nd vaccine dose. The primary vaccine series was granted an EUA in October 2021.

Children ages 5-11 make up almost 9% of the US population, and vaccinating this group has been a key goal promoted by experts who say vaccination is a way to maintain in-person learning. However, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), vaccine uptake is the lowest in this age-group, with only 28% of kids receiving 2 doses of vaccine.

Currently, Pfizer boosters are authorized for all Americans ages 12 and up.

The CDC COVID Data Tracker shows that 65.8% of Americans are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, 77.3% have received at least one dose of vaccine, and 45.3% of those eligible have received their 1st booster dose.

The 7-day average of new daily COVID-19 cases is 33 691, with 513 daily deaths, according to the New York Times tracker. Daily case counts are up 22% in the past 2 weeks.

In New York, state health officials said yesterday [13 Apr 2022] that they've identified 2 BA.2 sub-lineages (BA.2.12 and BA.2.12.1) that could be contributing to rising COVID-19 cases in central New York state and surrounding regions.

[2] 4th COVID vaccine
Date: Thu 14 Apr 2022
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/04/fourth-covid-vaccine-dose-gives-76-added-protection-against-death


Compared with a 3rd vaccine dose, a 4th dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine lowered the risk of infection, symptomatic infection, hospitalization, severe illness, and death 52%-76% -- depending on the measure -- amid the omicron surge among older adults, finds a new Israeli study (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2201688).

Protection against infection waned, however, after 5 weeks, but not protection against severe COVID-19. The findings were published yesterday [13 Apr 2022] in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Clalit Research Institute investigators in Tel Aviv led the study, which compared the effectiveness of a 4th vaccine dose 8 days earlier -- after a 3rd dose at least 4 months before -- relative to a 3rd dose only (control group) and a 4th dose 3-7 days earlier (internal control group), among 1 252 331 participants 60 and older from 3 Jan to 18 Feb 2022.

At 7 to 30 days after the 4th COVID-19 dose, vaccine effectiveness (VE) relative to the 3rd dose was estimated at 45% against infection (95% confidence interval [CI], 44%-47%), 55% against symptomatic illness (95% CI, 53%-58%), 68% against COVID-19 hospitalization (95% CI, 59%-74%), 62% against severe disease (95% CI, 50%-74%), and 74% against death (95% CI, 50%-90%).

At 14 to 30 days after the 4th dose, VE was 52% (95% CI, 49%-54%) against infection, 61% (95% CI, 58%-64%) against symptomatic illness, 72% (95% CI, 63%-79%) against hospitalization, 64% (95% CI, 48%-77%) against severe disease, and 76% (95% CI, 48%-91%) against death.

In the 4th week after the 4th dose, the adjusted infection rate was lower by a factor of 2.0 (95% CI, 1.9-2.1) than that in the 3-dose group and lower by a factor of 1.8 (95% CI, 1.7-1.9) than that among controls.

The difference in absolute risk for COVID-19 hospitalization 7-30 days after a 4th vaccine dose, relative to a 3rd, was 180.1 per 100 000 people (95% CI, 142.8-211.9), while it was 68.8 cases per 100 000 (95% CI, 48.5-91.9) for severe disease. A sensitivity analyses of VE against infection had similar results as those in the primary analysis.

Starting in the 5th week after the 4th dose, the rate ratio (RR) for infection began to fall. The adjusted rate of infection in the 8th week after the 4th dose was comparable to that of internal controls. The RR for the 3-dose group relative to the 4-dose group was 1.1, while the rate ratio for the internal control group, compared with the 4-dose groups, was 1.0.

The RRs comparing controls with 4th-dose recipients were larger and lasted longer for severe disease. In the 4th week after the 4th dose, the adjusted rate of severe disease was lower by a factor of 3.5 than in 3-dose recipients and a factor of 2.3 than in internal controls.

The adjusted rate of severe illness in the 4th week after the 4th dose was 1.6 cases per 100 000 person-days, compared with 5.5 cases per 100 000 in 3-dose recipients and 3.6 cases per 100 000 in internal controls. The adjusted rate differences were 3.9 fewer cases per 100 000 person-days and 2.1 fewer cases per 100 000 than the 3-dose group and internal controls, respectively.

Severe illness continued to occur at lower rates among 4th-dose recipients than in controls in later weeks after the 4th dose, with no signs of waning by the 6th week.

"Rates of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 were lower after a 4th dose of BNT162b2 [Pfizer] vaccine than after only 3 doses," the researchers wrote. "Protection against confirmed infection appeared short-lived, whereas protection against severe illness did not wane during the study period."

The authors noted that previous studies had suggested waning immunity to the delta variant as soon as 10 weeks after a 3rd dose. A study by a different Israeli group published earlier this month [April 2022] found that protection against omicron infection began to wane 4 weeks after a 4th dose, while it was still strong against severe illness at 6 weeks.

In a related commentary, Paul Offit, MD, of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said that many people are confused about the definition of "fully vaccinated" (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe2203329).

"Arguably, the most disappointing error surrounding the use of COVID-19 vaccines was the labeling of mild illnesses or asymptomatic infections after vaccination as 'breakthroughs,'" he wrote. For all mucosal vaccines, Offit said, the goal is to protect against hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and death.

"The term 'breakthrough,' which implies failure, created unrealistic expectations and led to the adoption of a zero-tolerance strategy for this virus," he wrote. "If we are to move from pandemic to endemic, at some point we are going to have to accept that vaccination or natural infection or a combination of the 2 will not offer long-term protection against mild illness."

Because additional COVID-19 doses aren't risk-free -- and all age-groups are susceptible to developing a decreased ability to respond to a new invading substance (e.g., variants) because the immune system has "locked" onto the original one -- Offit urged clarification of which groups benefit the most.

"It is now incumbent on the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] to determine who most benefits from booster dosing and to educate the public about the limits of mucosal vaccines," he concluded. "Otherwise, a zero-tolerance strategy for mild or asymptomatic infection, which can be implemented only with frequent booster doses, will continue to mislead the public about what COVID-19 vaccines can and cannot do."

[3] Genetic evolution of SARS-CoV-2
Date: Wed 13 Apr 2022

Emergence of sublineages and recombination events: Genetic evolution of SARS-CoV-2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The occurrence of mutations is a natural and expected event within the evolutionary process of viruses. Since the initial genomic characterization of SARS-CoV-2, this virus has been divided into different genetic groups or clades. In fact, some specific mutations define the viral genetic groups (also called lineages) that are currently circulating globally. Due to various microevolution processes and selection pressures, some additional mutations may appear, generating differences within each genetic group (called variants).

Since January 2020 more than 100 SARS-CoV-2 variants have been identified and only 5 of them have been considered as variants of concern (VOC)1 : alpha, beta, delta, gamma and more recently omicron.

After its emergence by mid-November 2021, the omicron VOC has rapidly increased in prevalence and became the predominant variant worldwide. In fact, almost 99% of the sequences shared since November 2021 on the GISAID global database correspond to omicron.

In the Americas, omicron was first detected by the end of November 2021, and rapidly spread to become predominant in the entire Region. As of [12 Apr 2022], omicron has been officially reported in 53 Countries and Territories and has been detected in 100% of the samples sequenced in the last 4 weeks.

As expected, the highly transmissible pattern demonstrated for omicron has facilitated the occurrence of additional mutations driving the emergence of different sublineages classified into the same variant (i.e., omicron). So far [12 Apr 2022], five (5) different main sublineages of omicron classified as BA.1 (including BA.1.1), BA.2, BA.3, BA.4 and BA.5 have been reported globally.

Although BA.2 is predominant in most of the Regions at global level (Africa, Asia, Europe, Oceania), in the Americas the sublineages BA.1 and BA.1.1 are still predominant and have been identified in more than 97% of the characterized samples since omicron's introduction. However, the proportions of BA.2 have been increasing in all subregions (Figure 2) and in the last 4 weeks [13 Mar-9 Apr 2022] it represents 35% of the omicron samples in Latin America (50% in North America). [Figures available at source URL]

The most recently described sublineages BA.4 and BA.5 were first reported on [4 Apr 2022] in South Africa and have apparently been circulating since January 2022. So far, around 135 omicron BA.4/BA.5 sequences have been reported to GISAID database, reported from South Africa (121), Botswana (3), Denmark (6), Germany (2), United Kingdom (2), and Belgium (1).

BA.4 and BA.5 sublineages share a similar Spike (S) protein gene profile as BA.2, except for some additional mutations (69-70del, L452R, F486V) including one similar to the original wild type index virus identified at the end of 2019 (Q493).

Regardless of these additional mutations and emergence of new sublineages, no significant changes in public health impact regarding the omicron sublineages have been demonstrated, besides the high transmission capacity already demonstrated by omicron. Although some treatments based on monoclonal antibodies might be affected by specific structural changes, vaccination, and non-pharmacological measures, including appropriate use of masks, remain extremely useful to control the virus and surge of cases. ...

Bhutan: 49 066 / 15 / 19

Over the last 7 days, 6905, 250, 718, 89, and 350 COVID-19 cases were detected in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, respectively. These numbers compare with 7292, 289, 1261, 103, and 794 in the preceding 7 days and reveal a decreasing trend of the disease in the 5 South Asian countries compared with the previous week.

The trends of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths attributed to the disease in Pakistan can be seen at https://covid19.who.int/region/emro/country/pk.

In the last 7 days, the total number of people who died due to COVID-19 was 168 in India, 1 each in Bangladesh and Pakistan, and 8 in Sri Lanka, but no one has died from the disease over the last 4 weeks or so in Nepal. Over the last 24 hours as of 15 Apr 2022 at 8:00 IST, COVID-19 deaths were reported from only 2 states of the 36 states and union territories in India -- Maharashtra (5), and Mizoram (1) (https://www.mohfw.gov.in/).

India has recently reported the presence of the XE variant of the virus in 2 patients (https://vervetimes.com/corona-virus-news-update-second-case-found-of-xe-variant-in-mumbai-positive-patient-took-both-doses-of-vaccine-mhpv/).

XE is a recombinant of omicron BA.1 and BA.2, reported for the 1st time from the UK in late March 2022 (https://www.healthline.com/health-news/what-to-know-about-the-covid-19-xe-variant#Mixed-variants-are-common).

As of 15 Apr 2022 at 8:00 IST (GMT+5:30) India has administered 1 863 062 546 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine (https://www.mohfw.gov.in/).

Bangladesh has a plan for vaccinating 70% of the population. As of 6 Apr 2022, 107.57% have received the 1st dose and 96.58% of the target population have received the 1st and 2nd doses. Around 9.41% of the target population have also received a 3rd dose as a booster vaccination (http://103.247.238.92/webportal/pages/covid19-vaccination-update.php).

As of 10 Apr 2022, Nepal has administered at least 43 757 928 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine (https://covid19.who.int/region/searo/country/np).

Sri Lanka has administered at least 39 365 274 doses of COVID vaccines so far. Assuming every person needs 2 doses, that is enough to have vaccinated about 90.3% of the country's population (https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/countries-and-territories/sri-lanka/).
