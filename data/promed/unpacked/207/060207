A man, aged 63 from Haiti, presented on Thursday, 30 May 2013, night at the emergency department of the CHU of Fort-de-France, in a state of dehydration. The tests quickly confirmed that he was suffering from cholera. So far, this does not imply the risk of an epidemic, according to the regional health agency.

The man was immediately placed in isolation room and was seriously ill as judged by doctors. The clinical signs appeared several hours after his aircraft landed from Port-au-Prince. Any contamination of other passengers on the flight is therefore excluded, according to the doctor.

Health authorities remain on alert for the people that would have been in contact with the patient upon his arrival in Martinique. But, for the moment, no disturbing symptoms have been reported.

At the Cholera Treatment Center-Saint Mary on the Soleil Wharf this afternoon, 24 May 2013, there are 6 inpatient pediatric cases being treated with IV fluids and 1 toddler being treated with oral rehydration solution. All of these kids are from Soleil except one who is from Drouillard (a zone just outside of Soleil).

There are 6 adult inpatient cholera patients in the adjoining room.

Like clockwork, 6 to 12 hours after the rain comes in the late afternoon, patients present to this CTC with vomiting and diarrhea. And it is clouding up right now and raining almost every day now during Haiti's rainy season.

[Whether spread of cholera will occur when introduced into a non-endemic area depends a lot on the degree of sanitation that is present there. In the developed world, there is little chance of much spread but, as seen in Haiti and to a lesser extent in the Dominican Republic and Cuba, poor infrastructure begets the spread of waterborne diseases such as cholera and typhoid. - Mod.LL]
