A potentially deadly virus being spread by mosquitoes has made its way to Ohio. Eastern equine encephalitis, or "Triple-E", has killed 3 people in Michigan. Health officials in Ohio are closely monitoring the spread of the virus.

Stephanie Green boards 36 horses at her Shoo Fly Stables in Fairfield County. She says her horses are like her children, which is why she takes no chances with their health. "Horses are very susceptible to a lot of different diseases, so we vaccinate every year. There's a 7-way shot that we give every year."

And this year [2019], that precaution could be even more important.

"We've had 3 horses infected that have died from Triple-E," said Dr. Tony Forshey, state veterinarian with the Ohio Department of Agriculture. "Triple-E is Eastern equine encephalitis. It's a virus circulating in the bloodstream and then gets into the brain and causes massive swelling. It's pretty much always fatal in those horses."

It is spread by mosquitoes to horses and humans. A total of 20 human cases have been reported in 5 states, including 3 deaths in Michigan. Forshey says there are 3 equine cases in Ohio, but no human cases. "We've alerted public health officials to be aware of that and tell their clients to protect themselves against mosquito bites," he said.

"Your chances of contracting Triple-E are significantly lower than West Nile Virus," said Sarah Fink with Franklin County Public Health. She says Triple-E is more dangerous than West Nile, but far more rare, especially in central Ohio.

"We don't have quite the habitat where Triple-E tends to start amplifying in the bird population. You see that more in fresh water swamps, which you find in Michigan, Massachusetts, North Carolina, those areas where we are having the Triple-E outbreaks."

The best way to protect yourself from Triple-E and West Nile, is to prevent mosquito bites. Avoid being outside during dawn and dusk, when mosquitoes are most active. Cover yourself with long sleeves and pants, and use insect repellent containing DEET.

Three people have died in Michigan from Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), and at least 4 others have been sickened. In Lapeer County, a horse has died from the mosquito-borne disease while an infected deer in Genesee County was euthanized. As a result, local and state officials have sounded the alarm.

The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) issued a warning Tuesday [17 Sep 2019] that urged people to cancel outdoor events scheduled around dusk, especially if those activities include children until after the 1st hard frost.

The DHHS announcement prompted Dryden Community Schools to spray its elementary school playground with insecticide Friday [20 Sep 2019] and warned parents not to let their children play there until Monday [23 Sep 2019].

North Branch Area Schools Superintendent Jim Fish canceled evening activities Thursday [19 Sep 2019] at the district's campus so APM Mosquito Control can spray mosquito control in the areas surrounding the playground, practice fields and other outdoor spaces around the district's 3 schools. He also announced the [27 Sep 2019] North Branch Elementary Family Fun Night and [30 Sep 2019] All-Star Reading Night have been moved inside the elementary school to be on the safe side.

EEE is a virus that causes inflammation in the brain (encephalitis) that can cause permanent neurological damage and death.

Health officials say the virus was discovered in Lapeer County after a horse died suspiciously. Its owner took the animal to Michigan State University for testing. Local horse owners are saying the horse died in the Lum area, but the owner doesn't want to be identified. They are urging other horse owners to have their animals vaccinated.

In addition to the human cases, as of [16 Sep 2019], 9 cases of EEE in horses had been confirmed in Barry, Kalamazoo and St. Joseph counties. None of the horses were vaccinated against EEE, and all the animals have died. Also, 5 deer in Barry, Cass, Genesee, Kalamazoo, and Van Buren counties have been confirmed with EEE infection and were euthanized due to the severity of their disease signs.

Bob Wheaton, a Health and Human Services spokesman, said this is the most serious EEE outbreak since 2001, when 6 people were sickened. Wheaton said EEE is the most deadly of all mosquito-borne diseases in Michigan, with a 33% mortality rate.

A Kalamazoo man who came down with the illness last month [August 2019] in Kalamazoo died in just 9 days. Although there is a vaccine for horses, there is no known vaccine for humans.

Michigan's high case count is not an outlier: 2019 appears to be the worst year for EEE cases in more than a decade across the nation. On average, 7 cases a year are reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), but this year [2019], at least 20 people have been diagnosed with EEE in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Rhode Island, as well as Michigan.

Only 2% to 6% of people who are bitten by mosquitoes carrying the virus go on to develop EEE. But in those that do, the illness hits hard and fast. Symptoms such as headache, high fever, chills and vomiting start 4 to 10 days after a person is bitten. As the disease progresses, the patient can experience disorientation, seizures and coma.

That, said Kathy Haskins, director of the Lapeer County Health Department, is because "Humans and horses are considered 'dead-end hosts', because the concentration of virus in their bloodstreams is usually insufficient to infect mosquitoes."

Birds and mosquitoes are the virus carriers, said Wheaton. He said getting EEE is difficult because 1st a black tail mosquito has to infect a bird, and then another species of mosquito, a cattail mosquito, has to bite an infected bird and then a human or other vulnerable species.

While only 2 of Michigan's 60 species of mosquitoes can carry the deadly virus, it's nearly impossible for most people to tell them apart, so Wheaton said the best thing to do is avoid mosquitoes. Wheaton urged people who must go out in the evening to use mosquito repellents containing DEET.

APM Mosquito Control, the Armada-based firm that supplies mosquito control services for Rich Township, North Branch and other mid-Michigan communities has stepped up its efforts. A spokesperson said the company has initiated additional surveillance activity in the immediate area of the infected deer detection. They added should additional mosquitoes test positive for EEE or mosquito populations increase, localized spraying will continue as weather conditions allow.

The CDC says the best way to avoid EEE is to avoid mosquito bites. That means using an EPA-approved mosquito repellent, wearing long sleeves and pants in wooded, swampy areas, and getting rid of standing water in flower pots, bird baths and anything else in your yard that holds water.

[The presence of Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in the Northern and Midwestern states of the USA indicates the virus can appear anywhere mosquitoes are.

The prudent equine owner, trainer, stable manager, etc. will insist all horses are vaccinated, regardless of location. The recent articles in Ohio and Michigan indicate the disease is no respecter of location.

Please vaccine your horses. The vaccine is a series of at least 2 injections with approximately 3 weeks between injections. The EEE vaccine is often combined with Western equine encephalitis (WEE) and West Nile virus (WNV) and usually tetanus. EEE immunity wanes a bit rapidly, so in the case of an outbreak, owners should be aware to vaccine every 3-4 months.

Humans should be aware of mosquito breeding locations, which is any standing water. Water in a potted plant catch basin, or old tire, or other depressions capable of holding water, can breed mosquitoes. Clean up the standing water to decrease the breeding of mosquitos.

EEE can affect humans in the same fashion as horses: through a mosquito bite. Consequently, eliminating standing water prevents mosquitoes and thereby helps both horses and humans.

There are mosquito repellants for horses. Be sure to use one approved for use on horses.

In humans, the most effective way to prevent infection from EEE virus is to prevent mosquito bites. Mosquitoes bite during the day and night. Use insect repellent, wear long-sleeved shirts and pants, treat clothing and gear, and take steps to control mosquitoes indoors and outdoors.

Use Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellents with one of the active ingredients below. When used as directed, EPA-registered insect repellents are proven safe and effective, even for pregnant and breastfeeding women.

- DEET
- Picaridin (known as KBR 3023 and icaridin outside the US)
- IR3535
- Oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE)
- Para-menthane-diol (PMD)
- 2-undecanone

Just as in horses, EEE can be fatal in people as well. Prevention of this disease is critical for your horse to survive and for you to avoid the disease. - Mod.TG
