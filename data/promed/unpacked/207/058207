FDA Warns Consumers Not to Use Certain Powdered Infant Formula Produced in Abbott Nutrition's Facility in Sturgis, Michigan
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Today [17 Feb 2022], the FDA announced it is investigating consumer complaints of _Cronobacter sakazakii_ and _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Newport infections. All of the cases are reported to have consumed powdered infant formula produced from Abbott Nutrition's Sturgis, Michigan facility. As a result of the ongoing investigation, along with the CDC and state and local partners, the FDA is alerting consumers to avoid purchasing or using certain powdered infant formula products produced at this facility. This is an ongoing investigation, and the firm is working with the FDA to initiate a voluntary recall of the potentially affected product.

The FDA is advising consumers not to use Similac, Alimentum, or EleCare powdered infant formulas if:
- the first two digits of the code are 22 through 37; and
- the code on the container contains K8, SH or Z2; and
- the expiration date is 1 Apr 2022 (April 2022) or later.

The FDA is investigating complaints of 4 infant illnesses from 3 states. All 4 cases related to these complaints were hospitalized and _Cronobacter_ may have contributed to a death in 1 case. The FDA has initiated an onsite inspection at the facility. Findings to date [17 Feb 2022] include several positive _Cronobacter sakazakii_ results from environmental samples taken by the FDA and adverse inspectional observations by the FDA investigators. A review of the firm's internal records also indicates environmental contamination with _Cronobacter sakazakii_ and the firm's destruction of product due to the presence of _Cronobacter_.

"As this is a product used as the sole source of nutrition for many of our nation's newborns and infants, the FDA is deeply concerned about these reports of bacterial infections," said Frank Yiannas, FDA Deputy Commissioner for Food Policy and Response. "We want to reassure the public that we're working diligently with our partners to investigate complaints related to these products, which we recognize include infant formula produced at this facility, while we work to resolve this safety concern as quickly as possible."

Additional Information:
- Products made at the Sturgis, Michigan facility can be found across the USA and were likely exported to other countries.
- Products that do not contain the information listed above are not impacted. The FDA advisory does not include liquid formula products or any metabolic deficiency nutrition formulas. Consumers should continue to use all products not covered by the advisory.
- To date, this investigation has been associated with 4 illnesses (3 for _Cronobacter_ and 1 for _Salmonella_) spanning the following states: MN, OH and TX [Minnesota, Ohio and Texas]. All 4 cases related to these complaints were hospitalized and _Cronobacter_ may have contributed to a death in one case.
- _Cronobacter_ bacteria can cause severe, life-threatening infections (sepsis) or meningitis (an inflammation of the membranes that protect the brain and spine). Symptoms of sepsis and meningitis may include poor feeding, irritability, temperature changes, jaundice (yellow skin and whites of the eyes), grunting breaths and abnormal movements. _Cronobacter_ infection may also cause bowel damage and may spread through the blood to other parts of the body.
- Parents and caregivers of infants who have used these products, and are concerned about the health of their child, should contact their child's healthcare provider. If your child is experiencing any of these symptoms, you should notify your child's healthcare provider and seek medical care for your child immediately.
- _Salmonella_ are a group of bacteria that can cause gastrointestinal illness and fever called salmonellosis. Most people with salmonellosis develop diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps. More severe cases of salmonellosis may include a high fever, aches, headaches, lethargy, a rash, blood in the urine or stool, and in some cases, may become fatal.
- Parents and caregivers should never dilute infant formula and should not make or feed homemade infant formula to infants.
- If your regular formula is not available, contact your child's healthcare provider for recommendations on changing feeding practices.

The FDA is continuing to investigate and will provide additional consumer safety information when it becomes available.

[Several clusters of cases of infection with _C. sakazakii_ linked to contaminated powdered infant formula have been reported in the past. This cluster appears to have dual contamination with the organism and _Salmonella_ Newport.

_Cronobacter sakazakii_ is a facultative anaerobic gram-negative bacillus, which belongs to the Enterobacteriaceae family. The organism has been implicated in neonatal intensive care unit outbreaks of meningitis, septicemia and necrotizing enterocolitis, particularly in preterm infants, although infections due to _C. sakazakii_ can occur in older infants, children and adults.

The association of neonatal infection due to _C. sakazakii_ with the use of powdered infant formula is not new. ProMED has previously reported on infection associated with powdered infant formula contaminated by _C. sakazakii_ (formerly called _Enterobacter sakazakii_) as seen in the "See Also" section below.

The organism has been associated with a number of different kinds of powdered formulas from many different countries, including the USA (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: _Enterobacter sakazakii_ infections associated with the use of powdered infant formula - Tennessee, 2001. MMWR 2002;51:297-300).

Genotyping has shown that patient and formula isolates shared the same typing pattern (Clark NC, Hill BC, O'Hara CM, et al. Epidemiologic typing of _Enterobacter sakazakii_ in two neonatal nosocomial outbreaks. Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis 1990;13:467-72).

_Cronobacter_ are frequently isolated from the environment, plant material (wheat, rice, herbs and spices) and various food products. Ingredients, such as starches from wheat and rice, can be a source of _Cronobacter_ that have been found to contaminate powdered infant formula.

Because powdered infant formulas are not necessarily sterile and may contain pathogenic bacteria, recommendations have been made concerning preparation and handling of these products (Agostoni C, Axelsson, I, Goulet O, et al. Preparation and Handling of Powdered Infant Formula: A Commentary by the ESPGHAN Committee on Nutrition. J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr 2004;39:320-22). - Mod.LL
