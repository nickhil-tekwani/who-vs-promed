Classical swine fever, Brazil
-----------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 2 Oct 2020 from Dr Marcos De Moraes, director, [Department of Animal Health, Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Supply], Brasilia, Brazil

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 18 Sep 2020
Date of confirmation of the event: 2 Oct 2020
Reason for notification: recurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 12 Nov 2019
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: classical swine fever virus [CSFV]
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Parnaiba, Piaui
Date of start of the outbreak: 18 Sep 2020
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: backyard
Total animals affected
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Swine / - / 2 / 1 / - / -

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Swine / ** / ** / 50 / **
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter
** Not calculated because of missing information

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: Suspicion was detected within passive surveillance carried out in backyard pigs. Investigations continue in order to identify the origin and the epidemiological links. Stamping out will be applied with disposal of the remaining animals on the premises. The State of Piaui is not part of the classical swine fever free zone and there are movement restrictions of animals and their by-products between the disease-free zone and the non-free zone.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; traceability; traceability; zoning; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals.
Measures to be applied: disinfection; stamping out.

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Federal Agriculture and Livestock National Laboratory of Minas Gerais (national laboratory)
Swine / real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 2 Oct 2020 / Positive

Future reporting:
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

["Classical swine fever (CSF) is a contagious viral disease of pigs, including wild boar. The causative virus is a member of the genus _Pestivirus_ of the family _Flaviviridae_, and is closely related to the viruses of bovine viral diarrhoea and border disease. There is only one serotype of CSF virus (CSFV).

"The disease may run an acute, subacute, chronic, late onset, or inapparent course, depending on a variety of viral and host factors of which the age of the animals, the virulence of the virus and the time of infection (pre- or post-natal) are of greatest importance. Adult pigs usually display less severe signs of disease than young animals and stand a better chance of survival. In pregnant sows, the virus may cross the placental barrier and reach the fetuses. In-utero infection with strains of the virus of moderate or low virulence can result in what is referred to as the 'carrier sow' syndrome followed by prenatal or early post-natal death, the birth of diseased piglets or an apparently healthy but persistently infected litter. An outbreak of CSF in domestic pigs has serious consequences for trade in pigs and pig products.

"The highly variable clinical picture of CSF precludes a diagnosis on clinical and pathological grounds alone. Laboratory methods are therefore essential for an unambiguous diagnosis. Detection of virus or viral nucleic acid in anticoagulated whole blood and of antibodies in serum are the methods of choice for diagnosing CSF in live pigs, whereas detection of virus, viral nucleic acid or antigen in organ samples is most suitable when the pig is dead.

"There is no known risk of human infection with CSF virus." Source: OIE Terrestrial Manual 2019, Chapter 3.8.3 Classical Swine Fever (Infection with Classical Swine Fever Virus) https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.08.03_CSF.pdf

As was mentioned in the epidemiological comment, "The State of Piauí is not part of the classical swine fever free zone and there are movement restrictions of animals and their by-products between the disease-free zone and the non-free zone". According to information available from the OIE web page (https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/docs/pdf/Resolutions/2020/A_RESO14_2020_CSF.pdf), Brazil is recognized as having 2 free zones from CSF according to the provisions of Chapter 15.2. of the Terrestrial Code (http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_csf.htm):
- One zone composed of the states of Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina as designated by the delegate of Brazil in a document addressed to the director general in September 2014;
- One zone covering the states of Acre, Bahia, Espirito Santo, Goias, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Minas Gerais, Parana, Rio de Janeiro, Rondonia, Sao Paulo, Sergipe, and Tocantins, Distrito Federal, and the municipalities of Guajara, Boca do Acre, south of the municipality of Canutama, and south west of the municipality of Labrea, in the state of Amazonas as designated by the delegate of Brazil in a document addressed to the director general in September 2015.
