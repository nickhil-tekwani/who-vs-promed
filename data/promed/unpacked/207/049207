2nd update on suspected viral haemorrhagic fever at Bogodogo University Hospital, Central Region, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On 22 Aug 2021, the Ministry of Health informed the population of the admission to the Medical Emergencies of the Bogodogo University Hospital (CHU-B) of a 22-year-old patient who had stayed in the Republic of [Cote d'Ivoire]. The diagnostic procedure consisted of sampling analysis at the National Reference Laboratory for Viral Haemorrhagic Fever (LNR-FHV at the Muraz Centre) and the Pasteur Institute of Dakar for confirmation. The results obtained make it possible to permanently rule out Ebola virus disease on this patient.

[We have no information about this 2nd suspected case other than his age. It is likely that he had symptoms suggestive of hemorrhagic fever leading to a suspected diagnosis of Ebola virus disease. Fortunately, Ebola was ruled out and this was not a case of transmission of the virus from the 22-year-old Ebola suspect patient who arrived in Burkina Faso on 20 Aug 2021 from Cote d'Ivoire (see Ebola update (41): Burkina Faso ex Cote d'Ivoire susp,Cote d'Ivoire ex Guinea,RFI 20210823.8616974). - Mod.TY
