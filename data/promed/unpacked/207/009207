Sydney water has changed the source of the bulk of the city's water supply
in a bid to cut the chances of another outbreak of contamination. The
decision came as new test results raised hopes that 3 million residents
could begin drinking from the tap again within a few days.
Water flowing from Sydney's main Prospect water filtration plant, which
treats 85 per cent of the city's water, has now tested clear on three
occasions since Friday night. However health officials yesterday warned
that the contamination alert would not be lifted until at least early this
week. NSW Health director general Michael Reid described the clear test
results as "encouraging news" but said more testing and water flushing was
needed before residents could drink the water.
Mr. Reid said clear readings had been taken from Orchard Hills filtration
plant, which services the lower Blue Mountains, and the Warragamba plant
which serves the town of Warragamba, but not the required three clear
readings in a 36-hour period.
Health Department head Mick Reid said further testing and flushing of water
mains would be carried out across the city in the next 48 hours. If the
tests were clear the boil-water alert, put in place last Tuesday, would be
progressively lifted.
Although it tested clear of parasites at the weekend, record levels of the
potentially fatal cryptosporidia and giardia have been detected recently in
the city's main supply, Warragamba Dam. Sydney Water incident manager Ron
Quill said yesterday the flow from the dam was now being cut dramatically.
Instead of supplying almost all the city's water it will now supply only a
third with the rest taken from Cataract Dam, south of the city.
The neighbouring Cordeaux Dam will be used as a back-up.
Mr. Quill said the levels of giardia and cryptosporidia found during this
contamination scare had been verified by laboratories in Australia and
London.
Mr. Quill said Cataract had a more pristine catchment and there was far
less chance of contamination from human or animal habitation. The switch
would also allow Warragamba to "recover" after recent heavy rains and
settle any particle matter which the parasites could attach to.
Concern about the quality of water from Warragamba, has been heightened
after a London-based expert told Sydney Water that cryptosporidia could
stay alive in sediment for up to two years.
With the source of the contamination still unclear a team of international
experts continued to focus on the Warragamba catchment and the Prospect
filtration plant yesterday. The team is due to report to the head of the
in- quiry into the contamination Peter McClellan within days. Mr. McClellan
is expected to hand another report tomorrow to the Government, this time
dealing with the management of the first contamination crisis four weeks
ago.
The Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal is also due to report today
on compensation for domestic and business consumers unable to drink the
water during the two outbreaks.
There has still been no sign of "any significant increase of illness" as a
result of either of the two contamination periods this month.
*****
[I referred yesterday's posting to an informed & experienced colleague who
commented:
The reports of oocyst concentrations of almost 10,000 Cryptosporidium
oocysts per 100 litres are a little hard to swallow. Even in water from
typically contaminated sources a figure of around 200 is more usual. There
are well-established criteria which will allow differentiation of genuine
oocysts (size, morphology, internal structures, especially the sporozoites)
from artifacts that merely pick up the stain and the Australian workers
will be aware of all this.
They are under exceptional media and political pressures and in the past
there have been many instances where Cryptosporidium oocysts have initially
been reported from environmental samples, only to be identified later
correctly by reference laboratories as algae or yeast cells. [Note the
reported comment above that the water samples have been cross checked
elsewhere in Australia and in England. In any event the first Australian
conference in Melbourne on Cryptosporidium in water, on October 5, 1998,
should be well attended.
A puzzling concern in Sydney must be that if high numbers of oocysts are
being reported from treated as well as raw water samples, then why are
there no detectable increases in human cases?
