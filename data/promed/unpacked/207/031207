As many as 200 people have been found to be infected with monkey fever (Kyasanur forest disease) in 4 talukas [sub districts] of Sindhudurg district [Maharashtra] since October 2016. So far, 12 deaths have been confirmed. However, some sources from the medical field claim that over 20 deaths have taken place and 321 people have been infected with monkey fever.

The fever has been reported at Dodamarg, Sawantwadi, Kudal and Kanakvali talukas. The fever was 1st reported in 2016. The district had sought help from doctors in Simoga and Manipal in Karnataka to tackle the problem.

Sindhudurg district malaria officer Ashwini Jangam said, "Samples taken from persons who have succumbed after getting infected with the fever have been sent to the National Institute of Virology in Pune to confirm the virus. The transmission of this disease is rampant through tick worm found on monkeys. We have started dusting malaphion 50m on both sides of the forest roads. Domestic animals are also being checked."

The team of Manipal doctors has set up a lab that can help in detecting the virus. The officials are also conducting programmes to make people aware of the virus. "Around 200 locals were reported to be suffering from monkey fever. Out of these, 12 persons have died of the disease. A team of Manipal doctors are collecting sample of the virus," Jangam said.

A resident from Sindhudurg Sagar Chavan, who has been organizing awareness drives on this issue, said, "We have got figures of at least 20 persons who have died due to monkey fever. As many as 321 have been infected. Many monkeys were also found dead which lead to the spread of the virus. Monkey habitats like cashew and coconut gardens are a major threat to the spread of the fever." Another local from Banda Mangal Kamat said, "The Manipal team has collected samples from various areas in Banda. A total of 9 deaths were reported in Satmatwadi and 2 more from nearby areas."

"Around 200 locals were reported to be suffering from monkey fever. Out of these, 12 persons have died of the disease. Initially, a team of doctors from Simoga, Karnataka had guided us given their 40 years of experience. A team of Manipal doctors are collecting sample of the virus."

[Sindhudurg is an administrative district in the state of Maharashtra in India, which was carved out of the erstwhile Ratnagiri District https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindhudurg_district

KFD typically occurs during the dry season from November through May, which correlates with increased activity of the nymphs of ticks. Exposure to adult ticks and nymphs in rural or outdoor settings increases the risk of infection; herders, forest workers, farmers, and hunters are particularly at increased risk of contracting the disease.

As mentioned in the above report, 12 deaths and 200 cases of Kyasanur forest Disease have been reported in Sindhudurg district of Maharashtra since October 2016. There is a need to create awareness among the general public on protection from tick bites and improving the availability of KFD vaccination facilities in the affected areas. The National Institute of Virology, Pune, has developed an inactivated chick embryo tissue culture vaccine against KFD http://www.icmr.nic.in/pinstitute/niv/KYASANUR%20FOREST%20DISEASE.pdf. - Mod.UBA
