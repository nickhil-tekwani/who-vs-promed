----------------------------------------------------------------------
There is currently no evidence that Wellfleet Bay Virus (WFBV) is tickborne. We speculate that it could be mainly because of its grouping among the largely tickborne Quarjaviruses. If WFBV does indeed turn out to be tickborne, we suspect the ticks would be acquired on the northern nesting grounds, not in Wellfleet, MA on the wintering grounds.
