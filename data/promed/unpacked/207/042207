On 1 Dec 2015 a male cub of Iberian lynx (_Lynx pardinus_) was found dead at a locality of Extremadura [Spanish autonomous community]. It was son of [K] and [K] and belonged to one of the 2 1st litters born in the wild in Extremadura (Spain), after re-introduction of this species in the region, through the project Life+Iberlince.

At first, the death was attributed to natural causes. However, a study that has just been published in the journal BMC Veterinary Research, led by Universidad de Extremadura and the DNR of Extremadura, shows that the cause of death was an infection by the Pseudo-Rabies Virus (PRV).

"This is the 1st case of pseudorabies described in an Iberian lynx, also known as Aujeszky's disease, and the 2nd in a wild felid. There is only other report, in a Florida Panther, in 1994. The analysis carried out indicated the virus belonged to a wild strain", said Javier Masot, scientist of the Universidad de Extremadura, and leader author of the scientific article.

These results are the 1st evidence that the PRV may have a negative impact on the survival of this endangered species.

The animal was found in an area called "Hornachos-Valle del Matachel", south-west of Badajoz. It was a male born in the wild from a healthy 3-year-old female. By means of photo-traps, the date of birth was estimated between 8 and 12 of March of 2015. The cub died at 9 months of age.

[The scientific article when this episode was reported can be found at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5217549/pdf/12917_2016_Article_938.pdf.

Pseudorabies is caused by Suid herpesvirus 1, a member of the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily. Although swine are the natural host of Pseudorabies virus (PRV), the virus has a broad host range and may cause fatal encephalitis in many species. When it affects free-ranging populations of an endangered species, like the Iberian lynx, this becomes an issue of great concern. The Iberian lynx is restricted to 2 separate regions of southwestern Spain. A total of 2 new nuclei are being founded though reintroduction 30 km [18.64 m] southwest (Guadalmellato) and northeast (Guarrizas), respectively, of the existing Sierra Morena subpopulation, and contained a few breeding females in 2012. Recently, reintroduction was undertaken in 5 additional sites, one of which is in Extremadura, where this episode took place. There are vaccines of pseudorabies that have been used in dogs (inactivated or, more recently, recombinants). Perhaps vaccination should be considered as a management tool in ongoing Iberian lynx conservation programs. - Mod.PMB
