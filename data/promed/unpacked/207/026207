Situation report update -- 25 Oct 2014
--------------------------------------
Summary
-------
A total of 10 141 confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) have been reported in 6 affected countries (Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Sierra Leone, Spain, and the United States of America) and 2 previously affected countries (Nigeria, Senegal) up to the end of [23 Oct 2014]. There have been 4922 reported deaths.

Following the WHO Ebola Response Roadmap structure, country reports fall into 2 categories: 1) those with widespread and intense transmission (Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone); and 2) those with or that have had an initial case or cases, or with localized transmission (Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Spain, and the USA).

Countries with widespread and intense transmission
--------------------------------------------------
A total of 10 114 confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of EVD and 4912 deaths have been reported up to the end of [18 Oct 2014] by the Ministry of Health of Liberia, [21 Oct 2014] by the Ministry of Health of Guinea, and [22 Oct 2014] by the Ministry of Health of Sierra Leone. All but one district in Liberia and all districts in Sierra Leone have now reported at least one case of EVD since the start of the outbreak. Of the 8 Guinean and Liberian districts that share a border with Cote d'Ivoire, only 2 are yet to report a confirmed or probable case of EVD.

A total of 450 health care workers (HCWs) are known to have been infected with EVD up to the end of [23 Oct 2014]: 80 in Guinea; 228 in Liberia; 11 in Nigeria; 127 in Sierra Leone; one in Spain; and 3 in the USA. A total of 244 HCWs have died.

WHO is undertaking extensive investigations to determine the cause of infection in each case. Early indications are that a substantial proportion of infections occurred outside the context of Ebola treatment and care. Infection prevention and control quality assurance checks are now under way at every Ebola treatment unit in the 3 intense-transmission countries. At the same time, exhaustive efforts are ongoing to ensure an ample supply of optimal personal protective equipment to all Ebola treatment facilities, along with the provision of training and relevant guidelines to ensure that all HCWs are exposed to the minimum possible level of risk.

Country: cases (all) / deaths
Guinea: 1553 / 926
Liberia*: 4665 / 2705
Sierra Leone**: 3896 / 1281
Total: 10 114 / 4912

*For Liberia, 276 more confirmed deaths have been reported than have confirmed cases.
**For Sierra Leone, 127 more probable deaths have been reported than have probable cases. Data are based on official information reported by ministries of health. These numbers are subject to change due to ongoing reclassification, retrospective investigation and availability of laboratory results.

Countries with an initial case or cases, or with localized transmission
----------------------------------------------------------
Five countries (Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Spain, and the USA) have now reported a case or cases imported from a country with widespread and intense transmission.

In Nigeria, there were 20 cases and 8 deaths. In Senegal, there was one case and no deaths. However, following a successful response in both countries, the outbreaks of EVD in Senegal and Nigeria were declared over on [17 Oct and 19 Oct 2014], respectively.

On [23 Oct 2014], Mali reported its 1st confirmed case of EVD. The patient was a 2 year old girl who travelled from the Guinean district of Kissidougou with her grandmother to the city of Kayes in western Mali, which is about 600 km [373 mile] from the Malian capital Bamako and lies close to the border with Senegal. The patient was symptomatic for much of the journey. On [22 Oct 2014], the patient was taken to Fousseyni Daou hospital in Kayes, where she died on [24 Oct 2014]. At present, 43 contacts, of whom 10 are HCWs, are being monitored; efforts to trace further contacts are ongoing. A WHO team was already in Mali to assess the country's state of readiness for an initial case. A rapid response team will also arrive in the coming days.

In Spain, the single case tested negative for EVD on [19 Oct 2014]. A 2nd negative test was obtained on [21 Oct 2014]. Spain will, therefore, be declared free of EVD 42 days after the date of the 2nd negative test if no new cases are reported. A total of 83 contacts are being monitored.

There have now been 4 cases and one death in the USA. The most recent case is a medical aid worker who volunteered in Guinea and returned to New York City on [17 Oct 2014]. The patient was screened and was asymptomatic on arrival but reported a fever on [23 Oct 2014] and tested positive for EVD. The patient is currently in isolation at Bellevue Hospital in New York City, one of 8 hospitals in New York State that have been designated to treat patients with EVD. Possible contacts are being identified and followed up. Two HCWs who became infected after treating an EVD-positive patient at the Texas Presbyterian Hospital of Dallas, Texas, have now tested negative for EVD. Of a total of 176 possible contacts linked with these cases, 109 are currently being monitored; 67 have completed 21-day follow-up. In Ohio, 153 crew and passengers who shared a flight with one of the infected HCWs (prior to the patient developing symptoms) are being followed up, though they are considered low-risk and are not considered to be contacts.

Country: cases (all) / deaths
Mali: 1 / 1
Spain: 1 / 0
USA: 4 / 1
Total: 6 / 2

[2] Mali: index case dies, many exposed

The authorities in Mali have confirmed the death of the country's 1st Ebola patient, a 2 year old girl. The World Health Organization said the toddler had travelled hundreds of km by bus from Guinea through Mali showing symptoms of the disease. More than 40 people known to have come into contact with her have been quarantined. The girl was being treated in the western town of Kayes, after arriving at a hospital on Wed [22 Oct 2014].

The child had travelled more than 1000 km (600 miles) from Guinea through the capital, Bamako, to Kayes. "The child's symptomatic state during the bus journey is especially concerning, as it presented multiple opportunities for exposures, including high-risk exposures, involving many people," WHO said. The girl's mother died in Guinea a few weeks ago, and the child was then brought by relatives to Mali...

[An earlier report said 6 nurses who attended the little girl in Kayes Hospital had been quarantined. This is a disaster for the country and the world. It is not a single, non-fatal case as in Senegal, nor an imported case with few contacts quickly contained, as in Nigeria and the USA, but something very much worse.

[Sad to say, but is there any reason to think that this border closure will be any more effective than others in West Africa? In exculpation, governments have to be seen to be taking firm steps. - Mod.JW]

[3] Ethiopia sending 200 volunteers

The Ethiopian government has pledged to deploy 200 volunteer health professionals to West Africa and also donated USD 500 000 to Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. The health professionals comprise medical doctors, nurses, field epidemiologists, environmental health personnel and public health specialists. These will engage in Ebola case management/treatment, surveillance, contact tracing, social mobilization, and community engagement, and will also assist national health systems in the affected countries to continue their essential and basic health, food, water and sanitation services.

Making the announcement, the Ethiopia minister of health, Dr Kesetebirhan Admasu, said: "This new commitment of deploying medical staff can be considered as a continuation and commitment of Ethiopia's firm stand for African solidarity. Ethiopia shall and will continue to support all efforts until this dreadful crisis is over."

Welcoming the Ethiopia offer, the commissioner for social affairs, Dr Mustapha Sidiki Kaloko, expressed appreciation to the government and people of Ethiopia for the exemplary contribution and hopes that the positive decision of Ethiopia will encourage other member states to favourably respond to the AU [African Union] chairperson's call for contributions from member states in the fight against Ebola. In response to the Ebola epidemic, the AU has deployed medical volunteers to Liberia and Sierra Leone under its African Union Support to Ebola Outbreak (Operation ASEOWA). The commission is deploying another batch of health experts to Guinea next week...

[4] Guinea: AmeriCares donation

Nearly 30 000 lbs [13 600 kg] of safety equipment and medical supplies from AmeriCares is headed to Guinea for health workers fighting the Ebola epidemic. The shipment -- AmeriCares 1st aid delivery to Guinea for the crisis -- includes more than 350 000 masks, 35 000 gowns and other protective equipment to support the Ebola response in Guinea. This personal protective equipment will be distributed to Ebola treatment units and health clinics and will be used to train health workers in infection control procedures.

"There are new cases of the virus reported every week in Guinea," said AmeriCares vice president of emergency response Garrett Ingoglia. "With the proper protective gear, we know we can stop the virus from spreading to health workers, who offer the best hope for containing the epidemic."

The shipment will be delivered on a humanitarian flight organized by Airlink, a Washington DC-based nonprofit that connects aid organizations with free passenger and cargo transportation. Airlink has established an air bridge to streamline transportation of critically needed supplies to combat the Ebola outbreak in West Africa...

[AmeriCares sent 60 000 lbs of similar Ebola aid to Liberia in September 2014; see ProMED post Ebola virus disease - West Africa (182): vaccine, orphans, S.Leone, prevention 20140930.2817719. Not to denigrate such charity to Guinea, but judging by the latest case figures one might have thought that Sierra Leone, with 2.5 times the number of reported cases, is in greater need, and also, as long as Sierra Leone has cases, Ebola will return to Guinea in cross-border traffic.
