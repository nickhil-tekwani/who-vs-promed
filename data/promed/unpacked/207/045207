Warm winter weather, combined with the prolonged drought that has
gripped a wide swathe of China, has put crops at risk across the
country, officials have said.
Unseasonably high temperatures last winter [2006-2007] caused wheat,
the country's 2nd most important crop after rice, to grow
extraordinarily fast in many areas, making it more vulnerable to
drastic weather changes, the Ministry of Agriculture said yesterday
[3 Apr 2007].
The average temperature during the past winter was minus 2.4 deg C
(28 deg F), nearly 2 deg C higher than normal, official statistics showed.
The higher temperature has caused 3.1 million hectares of wheat, or
15 percent of the total area planted with winter wheat, to grow
abnormally lushly, ministry official Wang Xiaobing said.
In addition, the warm weather allowed insects and bacteria to survive
the winter, meaning farms could expect to see more pests and diseases
this year [2007], he said.
For example, at least 840 000 hectares (2.1 million acres) of wheat,
mostly in Central China, are suffering from yellow rust disease, a
kind of fungus that affects plants, according to ministry statistics.
"We must bring the infection under control or it could spread to
other key grain producers, like Hebei Province in North China, Henan
Province in Central China, and Shandong in East China," Wang told China Daily.
Wang said the ministry has urged local agricultural departments to
prepare contingency plans for possible cold snaps and strong winds
that may affect wheat seedlings.
Meanwhile, the drought that has stretched through the winter has
adversely affected an even larger area.
At least 13.5 million hectares (33.4 million acres) of farmland in
China had been hit by drought by the end of last month [March 2007],
according to the latest statistics from the State Flood Control and
Drought Relief Headquarters.
Ministry of Agriculture official Wang said he believed the current
drought would not make a significant dent in the country's grain production.
Wheat accounts for nearly 90 percent of the crops harvested in
summer. Summer grain, mainly wheat and early rice, which is sown in
spring, contributes to a quarter of China's total grain production,
according to Wang.

[Wheat stripe rust, also called yellow rust disease, is caused by the
fungus _Puccinia striiformis_. It is distributed generally throughout
wheat production areas at high elevations and in the northern and
southern areas of temperate regions. Symptoms on wheat are yellow
stripes on leaves and stunting of plants. Yield losses of 40 percent
can be common with some fields totally destroyed. Severe losses
result when spikes are infected. Infection occurs in cool moist
conditions, spores dispersed by wind. It is primarily a disease of
wheat (_Triticum_ sp.) and a few barley (_Hordeum vulgare_) cultivars
worldwide. Control by fungicides, cultivation management and use of
resistant cultivars.
