Incidence trends and short term predictions for vCJD in the UK
--------------------------------------------------------------
By the beginning of November 2001, the total number of cases of variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [abbreviated vCJD or CJD (new var.) in
ProMED-mail reported in the United Kingdom had reached
111().
To monitor the underlying trend in vCJD incidence and identify any
differences in this trend by factors such as birth cohort and sex,
quarterly analyses are performed that estimate the underlying trend. The
models fitted to the data also enable short-term predictions for the
expected number of deaths in the next year and an estimate of the total
number of people with onset of symptoms who are yet to be identified.
These quarterly analyses are now available on the CJD surveillance unit
website at , with the first report covering the period up
to September 2001. This report included 107 cases, of whom 101 had died.
The distribution of these 107 cases by year of symptom onset, diagnosis,
and death is shown in the table. The median age at death for the cases in
each year is also given; the overall median age was 28 (range 14-74 years).
The median number of days from onset to diagnosis was 333 days and from
onset to death was 401 days. Of the 107 cases, 56 (52 percent) were male.
Cases diagnosed by September 2001 by year of onset, diagnosis, and death:
Year / Onset / Diagnosis / Death / Median age at death
94 / 8 / 0 / 0 / -
95 / 10 / 7 / 3 / -
96 / 11 / 8 / 10 / 30
97 / 14 / 12 / 10 / 26
98 / 17 / 17 / 18 / 25.5
99 / 29 / 17 / 15 / 29
2000 / 18+ / 27 / 28 / 25.5
2001 / 0+ / 19 / 17 / 28
(Note. Year 2001 shows data to the end of September.)
The recent analyses showed that the underlying incidence is increasing by
22 percent per year using date of symptom onset or 27 percent per year
using date of death. The analysis using date of symptom onset made it
possible to include all 107 cases but also required adjustment in the model
for the delay from symptom onset to diagnosis. The figure shows the
incidence of onsets by quarter with the fitted underlying trend. The
estimated current incidence is 8.2 onsets per quarter. In recent quarters,
the expected number of cases is much higher than the observed number of
cases owing to the reporting delay. The cumulative difference between the
expected number and the observed number is 27, which means that the
estimated total number of cases with onsets by the end of September 2001 is
134 (107 + 27); 95 percent confidence interval (124 to 148). To investigate
whether there is any evidence that the epidemic is reaching a peak, a
quadratic term was included in the model. This term was not significant
(P=0.53), which means there is currently no evidence of a departure from an
exponential increase [see original article for figure.
The analysis using date of death included 101 cases. No adjustment for
reporting delay was required for deaths because most cases are diagnosed
before death. The estimated current quarterly incidence of deaths is 7.5,
and, assuming the current trend continues, the total number of deaths in
the next 12 months is predicted to be 35 (22 to 50).
So far the age at death has not increased with time as might be expected
for an outbreak due to a point source in time. This stable age is generated
by the fact that the underlying trend is increasing more quickly in those
born after 1970 (42 percent per year) compared to those born before 1970
(12 percent per year). The difference between these trends is not quite
significant (P=0.087) but, if real, may be generated by factors such as age
dependent exposure or incubation periods.
Conclusions
These models allow short-term predictions and trend estimates but cannot be
used for long-term predictions or predictions of the total size of the
epidemic. This can only be attempted using techniques such as back
calculation, as recently performed by Huillard et al. (1). The quarterly
analyses will continue to be performed in order to update short-term
predictions, assess differences in trend by sex and cohort, and detect any
changes in the incidence trend that might indicate that the epidemic has
reached a peak.

Missing Gene Increases Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Risk
-------------------------------------------------------------
Recent research suggests that people who lack a particular version of a
gene involved in immune responses may be 3 times more likely to suffer
new-variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [abbreviated as vCJD or CJD (new
var.) in ProMED mail. If the finding is borne out in larger studies, it
could provide scientists with an important clue in their bid to develop
therapies for the incurable brain disease. It may also help doctors to
identify those people at risk. And it may lead to a more practical way to
diagnose the condition. At present, a positive diagnosis can be achieved by
analyzing tissue taken from the tonsils. This discovery paves the way for a
simple blood test.
The gene, called DQ7, is part of a complex called HLA that produces
molecules responsible for presenting bits of proteins to the immune system.
It does not seem to offer protection against the sporadic form of the
disease, in which rogue particles called prions are thought to form
spontaneously in the brain. But it does appear to play a role in people who
develop the disease after eating prions contained in BSE-contaminated meat.
The researchers studied the genetic makeup of 50 patients with vCJD,
approximately half of the population known to have the disease. Only 12
percent of the patients possessed the DQ7 gene, compared with 36 percent of
the normal population. The research was carried out by a team from the UK's
Medical Research Council Prion Unit at the Institute of Neurology led by
Professor John Collinge. Writing in the journal Nature, they state that:
Our results suggest that the presence of DQ7 protects against vCJD.
However, they warn that although they studied about half of all the people
known to have contracted vCJD, their sample is still too small to be
conclusive.
Dr Graham Jackson, a member of Professor Collinge's team, told BBC News
Online that: This is the first time that anyone has identified a genetic
susceptibility outside of the prion protein gene itself. The strong
likelihood is that other genes are also involved. If we could identify a
combination of say 6 markers, then it might be possible to introduce mass
screening for susceptibility to vCJD.
