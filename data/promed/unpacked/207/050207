One JL died of anthrax in Khadagpur village under Nandapur block [Koraput district, Odisha] on Wednesday [23 Jul 2014]. After consuming partially cooked meat at a feast in the village, he had taken ill.

As JL did not take the help of doctors, his condition deteriorated. Later, he was found to be suffering from anthrax by ICDS [Integrated Child Development Services] staff who shifted him to Koraput Hospital where he succumbed.

Meanwhile, a team of doctors rushed to the village and provided medicines to eight other villagers who had also taken the meat in the feast. Additional district medical officer Arun Padhi said a team of doctors is monitoring the situation.

[To repeat myself: "It is very clear that this livestock anthrax problem is not just from sporadic cases but reflects an epidemic status that is resulting in multiple human cases, when affected stock in scattered tribal villages are slaughtered and butchered."

It is not cost effective to only treat the humans after they have been exposed. The cheapest and most cost effective method is to vaccinate the livestock. In this way if the locals insist on slaughtering and consuming sick animals they at least are not consuming animals that have died from anthrax.

Koraput is the southernmost district of Odisha state; see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koraput_district and http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/21/Koraput.html. - Mod.MHJ
