A young man from Magdelena is currently interned in a La Plata hospital with a clinical picture of a hantavirus infection. This young man was taken recently from his hometown to the Hospital Espanol in our city [La Plata].

This situation unleashed the fury of his family members and friends, who blocked Route 11 for various hours in "repudiation of the attention that he had in the Magdalena health center," said the father of the young man.

This past 26 Sep [2013], the young man was diagnosed with a hantavirus infection from laboratory tests done in the Malbranl Hospital, a reference institution for the study and treatment of this type of disease.

Some 10 days before, he suffered symptoms compatible with severe influenza or angina and was attended to in the Santa Maria Magdalena Municipal Hospital, where, as his father stated, he was diagnosed with "gastroenteritis."

The father decided to take his son out of the local hospital and take him on his own to Espanol Hospital in La Plata, "where he received a better type of attention." In the hospital at the corner of streets 9 and 35, he received intensive care and is stable with slight improvement, according to sources from this health center.

[As has been mentioned in previous moderator comments concerning hantavirus infections in Argentina, cases of hantavirus infections were reported from various parts of Argentina last year (2012) and again this year (2013), including Buenos Aires province. The specific hantaviruses involved in these cases, including the one above, are not specified. As noted in ProMED-mail archive no. 20110430.1348, several hantaviruses have been associated with human infection and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Lechiguana (in central Argentina in the yellow pygmy rice rat _O. flavescens_); Oran (in northwestern Argentina in _O. longicaudatus_); and Bermejo (western Argentina in _O. flavescens_). ProMED would be interested in receiving information about the specific virus involved when laboratory tests have been completed.

Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved. Andes virus seems very unlikely in this case. This case may have been caused by Lechiguana virus infection.

An image of the yellow pygmy rice rat, _O. flavescens_, is available at http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_WrdzfKHDxmQ/SJ-E642S6MI/AAAAAAAABz4/DaDCHaFSDDE/s400/rato+dagua.jpg.
