Human infection with avian influenza A(H5) viruses
--------------------------------------------------
From 2003 through 23 Jan 2015, 718 laboratory-confirmed human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection have been officially reported to WHO from 16 countries. Of these cases, 413 have died.

Since the last WHO Influenza update on 6 Jan 2015, 24 new laboratory-confirmed human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection, including 11 fatal cases, were reported to WHO from Egypt. Of the 24 cases, 7 had onset of disease in December 2014 and the rest had onset of disease in January 2015. The cases were reported from 9 different governorates of Egypt (see table 1 [see tables and figures at source URL above]).

Of the new cases, there was one cluster which included 2 confirmed cases in siblings from Assiut governorate. Both of these cases had disease onset on the same day and both had exposure to backyard poultry. All cases had exposure to poultry or poultry markets, except for 3 cases in which the sources of infection are still under investigation.

Currently, there are reports of an increased number of outbreaks and detections of influenza A(H5N1) viruses in poultry in Egypt compared to previous months and compared to this month in previous years.

The number of laboratory-confirmed human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection reported by Egypt in December [2014] was the highest reported by any country in a single month. Although all influenza viruses evolve over time, preliminary laboratory investigation has not detected major genetic changes in the viruses isolated from the patients or animals compared to previously circulating isolates. The increase in the number of human cases is likely attributed to a mixture of factors, including increased circulation of influenza A(H5N1) viruses in poultry, lower public health awareness of risks in middle and upper Egypt and seasonal factors such as closer proximity to poultry because of cold weather and possible longer survival of the viruses in the environment. Epidemiological and virological investigation in humans and animals is ongoing.

Various other H5 subtypes, such as influenza A(H5N2), A(H5N3), A(H5N6) and A(H5N8), have recently been detected in poultry in Europe, North America, and Asia, according to reports received by OIE. Although these influenza A(H5) viruses might have the potential to cause disease in humans, so far no human cases of infection have been reported, with exception of the 2 human infections with influenza A(H5N6) virus detected in China in 2014.

Overall public health risk assessment for avian influenza A(H5) viruses: Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, sporadic infections and small clusters of human cases are possible in people exposed to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Human infections remain so far rare and these influenza A(H5) viruses do not currently appear to transmit easily among people. As such, the risk of community-level spread of these viruses remains to be low.

Human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses
----------------------------------------------------
A total of 486 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus, including 185 deaths, have been reported to WHO: 469 cases by China National Health and Family Planning Commission, 4 cases by the Taipei Centers for Disease Control (Taipei CDC), 12 cases by the Centre for Health Protection, China, Hong Kong SAR, and 1 case in a Chinese traveler, reported from Malaysia.

The majority of recently reported human cases are associated with exposure to infected live poultry or contaminated environments, including markets where live poultry are sold. A(H7N9) viruses continue to be detected in poultry and their environments in the areas where human cases are occurring. There have been no major genetic changes in the viruses isolated from recent patients compared to previously isolated viruses from humans. Information to date suggests that these viruses do not transmit easily from human to human.

Overall public health risk assessment for avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses: Overall, the public health risk from avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses has not changed since the assessment published on 2 Oct 2014.

WHO is closely monitoring this event and separate risk assessments have been posted. Please find the most updated information at http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/influenza_h7n9/Risk_Assessment/en/index.html and http://www.who.int/csr/don/27-january-2015-avian-influenza/en/.

Figure 2: Epidemiological curve of avian influenza A(H7N9) cases in humans by month of onset. Number of confirmed human H7N9 cases by week as of 26 Jan 2015.

Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health, especially over the coming winter months. All human infections with non-seasonal influenza viruses are reportable to WHO under the IHR (2005). It is critical that influenza viruses from animals and people are fully characterized in appropriate animal or human health influenza reference laboratories and reported according to international standards.

[2] China (Guangdong): H7N9

CHP notified of 3 human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) in Guangdong
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) is today (29 Jan 2015) closely monitoring 3 additional human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) notified by the Health and Family Planning Commission of Guangdong Province (GDHFPC), and again urged the public to maintain strict personal, food and environmental hygiene both locally and during travel.

According to the GDHFPC, 2 male patients aged 21 (in Shenzhen) and 59 (in Meizhou) and a female patient aged 42 (in Foshan) were hospitalised for management. The male patients are in a stable condition while the female patient is in a critical condition.

To date, 502 human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) have been reported by the Mainland health authorities, respectively in Zhejiang (146 cases), Guangdong (140 cases), Jiangsu (63 cases), Shanghai (44 cases), Fujian (28 cases), Hunan (24 cases), Anhui (17 cases), Jiangxi (9 cases), Xinjiang (9 cases), Shandong (6 cases), Beijing (5 cases), Henan (4 cases), Guangxi (3 cases), Jilin (2 cases), Guizhou (1 case) and Hebei (1 case).

"Locally, we will remain vigilant and work closely with the World Health Organization and relevant health authorities to monitor the latest developments," a spokesman for the DH said.

All boundary control points have implemented health surveillance measures. Thermal imaging systems are in place for body temperature checks on inbound travellers. Suspected cases will be immediately referred to public hospitals for follow-up. The DH's Port Health Office has enhanced body temperature checks with handheld devices.

Regarding health education for travellers, the display of posters and broadcasting of health messages in departure and arrival halls, environmental health inspection and provision of regular updates to the travel industry and other stakeholders will be enhanced.

Travellers, especially those returning from avian influenza-affected areas with fever or respiratory symptoms, should immediately wear masks, seek medical attention and reveal their travel history to doctors. Health-care professionals should pay special attention to patients who might have had contact with poultry, birds or their droppings in affected areas.

The public should remain vigilant and take heed of the advice against avian influenza below:
- Do not visit live poultry markets and farms. Avoid contact with poultry, birds and their droppings;
- If contact has been made, thoroughly wash hands with soap;
- Avoid entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered and contact with surfaces which might be contaminated by droppings of poultry or other animals;
- Poultry and eggs should be thoroughly cooked before eating;
- Wash hands frequently with soap, especially before touching the mouth, nose or eyes, handling food or eating; after going to the toilet or touching public installations or equipment (including escalator handrails, elevator control panels and door knobs); and when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing;
- Cover the nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing, hold the spit with a tissue and put it into a covered dustbin;
- Avoid crowded places and contact with fever patients; and
- Wear masks when respiratory symptoms develop or when taking care of fever patients.
