Three cases of haemolytic-uraemic syndrome (HUS) have been notified to the
Communicable Disease Control Branch of the South Australian Health
Commission since early April. The second and third cases were notified
within 24 hours of each other. However, interviews with the families
revealed that onset dates were 1st, 7th and 21st April. Two of the cases
come from different parts of metropolitan Adelaide, and the other from a
country town. The cases were of different ages and had very different
diets. There was no social contact between the cases, nor was there contact
with farm animals or swimming pools.
Surveillance of Shiga toxin producing _E coli_ in South Australia is mainly
by multiplex PCR of stool samples from patients with bloody diarrhoea.
Several genes are examined. Using this technique all cases had similar
profiles, and _E coli_ O113 has been isolated from the second case.
Serotypes are not available for the other cases.
An epidemiological investigation is continuing.

[Clearly the original newspaper report dated 27 Apr 1988 should have
said that lab results would be available shortly. We are greatly
indebted to Dr. Hall for this communication.
Conclusions:
1) This is not an outbreak, but 3 unrelated cases.
2) A hantavirus is probably not involved. A concerned Australian
reader wrote us to say they don't have hantaviruses in Australia.
But Seoul virus, which is a hantavirus and can cause human disease,
has been found in all major port cities studied, including 2 in
Indonesia, so it probably does occur in Australia. - Mod.JW

A minor correction to the [previous report on HUS. Robert Hall is the South
Australian Health Commission's Communicable Diseases Director [i.e., not
the one for the whole of Australia - Mod.JW.
The previous outbreak referred to was caused by _E. coli_ 0111.
