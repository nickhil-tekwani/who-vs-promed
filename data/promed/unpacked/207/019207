At least 12 villages in Dulag, Leyte have been placed under strict surveillance due to new cases of African swine fever (ASF), the Department of Agriculture (DA) announced on Sunday [31 Jan 2021]. These villages are within the 7 to 10 km (4.3 to 6.2 mi) radius of a confirmed ASF case in Combis village as validated by the result of a laboratory test released on 29 Jan 2021.

"Village officials were given a thorough orientation briefing by the regional task force and proper advice on how to manage, contain, and control the spread of the disease," the DA regional office said in a statement. All hog raisers in Dulag, some 41 kilometers (25 mi) south of this city, are advised to closely monitor their respective hogs and report to their municipal agriculture office any observed disease symptoms of hogs and institute strict quarantine measures, avoid swill feeding, and, most importantly, to report immediately any incidence of unusual deaths.

Dulag is the 4th town in Leyte Province with confirmed ASF cases. The 1st case was in Abuyog town recorded on 14 Jan 2021. Dulag is about 44 kilometers (27 mi) from Abuyog. Other areas with ASF are Javier and MacArthur. Last week, the agriculture department collected blood samples in Dulag after the unusual and sudden death of a sow in Combis village.

"Our appeal to local government units in the adjoining areas is to take immediate action and seriously address the spread of the animal disease in their locality. Create or reactivate their ASF task force by stepping up efforts to regulate the movement of live pigs, pork, and processed pork products that go inside and outside their respective towns," the DA said. Since the ASF outbreak hit the province early in January [2021], at least 1600 pigs have been culled to contain the spread of the disease.

Initial investigation showed that the ASF virus could have been transmitted to local farms in Leyte through infected boar being used for natural mating and by hog traders who may have fed their stocks with contaminated food products.

Pigs affected by ASF usually manifest high fever, distinct reddish areas on the skin of the neck, chest, and extremities, and bleeding of internal organs that could lead to death within 2 to 10 days.

As of the end of 2020, the entire province had 127 725 live pigs.

[Further to the above information, 3 additional towns in Leyte have been reported by PNA on Friday (5 Feb 2021) as ASF-infected. For details, please see https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1129759. The island of Leyte has become the 3rd main island of the Philippines affected by ASF, following Luzon and Mindanao. This spread, which reportedly started mid-January and was lab confirmed on 29 Jan 2021, is yet to be officially reported to the OIE. - Mod.AS

A total of 61 pigs were marked to be culled Tuesday [2 Feb 2021] after the animals tested positive for African swine fever (ASF) in Bacacay town in Albay Province. Bacacay Mayor Armando "Dinky" Romano said Barangay Hindi, where the 61 pigs came from, is now the epicenter of ASF cases.

Backyard hog raisers within 500 meters of the village were advised to subject their pigs to ASF examination. Once tested positive for the disease, the pigs will be submitted for depopulation.

Meanwhile, Romano said animal checkpoints at the borders of Bacacay were set up to check the entry and exit of animals, including meat products, from areas declared as ASF hot spots, to prevent the spread of the disease.

Bacacay town is a 2nd-class municipality in Albay located some 37.1 km (23 mi) away from Legazpi City.

[The detection of ASF in Albay Province means another spread of the disease into a new, hitherto uninfected region of the Philippines, namely, Bicol, which comprises the southern part of Luzon, the largest island in the Philippine archipelago, and includes Albay.

According to the OIE reports, the ASF event in the Philippines started in July 2019. The 1st cluster was situated in the province of Rizal within the island Luzon, spreading to other provinces on the island, affecting primarily backyard pig holdings. The most recent follow-up report (no. 12) from this region was submitted to OIE on 24 Sep 2020. The epidemiological statistics, accumulated until the said date, have been summarised by OIE as follows:

Total outbreaks = 427 (submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Swine / 305 292 / 5442 / 1201 / 308 992 / 5

A 2nd cluster, in the Mindanao island, reportedly started 29 Jan 2020; its most recent follow-up report (no. 5) was submitted on 28 Sep 2020. The epidemiological statistics, accumulated until the said date, have been summarised by OIE as follows:

*For those puzzled by figures of "cases" being reportedly lower than those of "deaths": please see the raw figures of all reports, available in the summary at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000035866_20200928_152235.pdf.

In the meantime, ASF has been continuing its circulation in the regions known to be affected. Recently, close to 42 000 pigs had to be culled in Davao Region, Mindanao, due to ASF; see https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1129493, dated 3 Feb 2021. - Mod.AS]
