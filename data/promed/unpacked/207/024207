What is usually a daily 2-person, 2-hour job on [JMR] farm became a huge task for twice as many people when her calves were hit with rotavirus.

Instead of feeding twice a day, [JMR] was working around the clock tube-feeding electrolytes in a fight against the dehydration which can kill calves infected with the gastrointestinal bug.

"It was heart-wrenching really, you had all these calves so unwell the only option was to tube-feed them," [she] said.

Her Southland property had its 1st rotavirus outbreak 5 years ago and has had ongoing problems since. At the same time, her calves were affected by cryptosporidium, which also causes diarrhoea and calf deaths.

During the 1st outbreak, [JMR] and her husband, who milk 500 cows on a property owned by her parents, were able to limit calf deaths to 5.

Ash Keown from the New Zealand Veterinary Association said most herds will have rotavirus but not all farms will have a clinical disease problem in their young stock.

It is more common on dairy farms because calves are taken off their mothers earlier and kept in pens, whereas beef calves are generally in paddocks.

"The contamination is still there but it's spread over a massive area, so they're less likely to encounter as much virus," Keown said.

Rotavirus hits calves between 3 days and 3 weeks old and is caught by coming into contact with infected faeces. It attacks gut-lining cells and causes diarrhoea, leaving calves dehydrated and weak.

It was important to start electrolytes at the 1st sign of the virus and to quarantine sick calves. If treatment was left too late, the calves were less able to absorb the fluids and sugars they needed, Keown said.

"If you're able to identify them nice and early, they shouldn't get to the point where you have to get the vet out to do IV fluids."

[JMR] has successfully worked to lessen the impact of rotavirus but it's still a major worry at calving time.

Reducing the number of calves to a pen is one of the ways [JMR] has avoided rotavirus outbreaks.

She says they might have had cases in earlier years, but the few sick calves had been easily treated and soon recovered. "Then that year, we just had calves go down one after the other and they'd barely even lift their head, let alone stand to feed."

Diagnosis requires a vet and Keown said it was important to test more than one calf because it could be missed with a smaller sample. Tests often showed calves were infected with other diseases, "so it is quite important to work out which one you're dealing with," he said.

[JMR] herd has not had cryptosporidium again but she said they have had have an element of rotavirus coming through each year.

Ash Keown says making sure pens are completely disinfected at the end of the season is a good guard against rotavirus.

This year [2019], her husband brought calving forward a week and most of their replacement heifers have been unaffected but they are treating 6 of the tail-enders now, an exhausting task on top of the round-the-clock demands of calving.

"It's time consuming and it's hard to see these calves that were doing so well go backwards."

Keown said rotavirus was less likely at the beginning of calving because there were fewer calves and they were getting higher quality colostrum. Testing colostrum and vaccinating cows were important measures against rotavirus.

Vaccination could be expensive, Keown said, but needed to be weighed up against the greater cost infection and stock losses could cause.

Vaccinated cows pass antibodies on to calves through their colostrum. "If they're having that good quality colostrum in the 1st 12 hours, that's going to set them up for life," he said.

[JMR's] herd, excluding the heifers, is vaccinated this year [2019]. Vaccination had cost about NZD 8 [about USD 5] a cow but next year only the heifers would need vaccinating and the cows would get a booster at half that price.

"Short term, it's a whole lot more money on vaccination but long term we'll have better coverage," she said.

She makes sure their water troughs are cleaned out every day and has lowered the number of calves per pen, from 15 calves to 12. Hydrated lime is spread in the pens and disinfectant spray is used.

Keown said it was important to manage rotavirus risk by thoroughly decontaminating sheds at the end of each season.

Scraping out everything then using commercial steam cleaners and spraying thoroughly with disinfectant was best.

Pen set-ups were important too, he said, making sure there was good drainage, plenty of air flow and keeping calves separated in smaller groups could break the cycle of transmission.

Pregnant herself during this year's [2019] calving, [JMR] felt all the hard work managing rotavirus was worth it.

"All your energy goes into keeping your calves healthy, happy, and growing well and when your efforts pay off it's such a great feeling."

["Rotavirus is a virus that invades the cells in the intestines causing them to die and slough off. The intestine has villi which are finger like projections and they are necessary for absorption of fluid and nutrients. As the cells die off the villi become damaged and very short, thus they no longer can absorb fluid and nutrients and scouring occurs. The scour is usually pasty white but can have blood in it. Once all the cells have been damaged the virus generally dies out on its own and the gut starts to try and regrow but this takes time.

"During this time the calf is susceptible to other diseases, particularly diseases involving the intestines/guts. It cannot absorb fluid and nutrients properly so the calf becomes weak and dehydrated and growth is impaired. Often many, if not all calves will be affected and up to 20 percent may die. Most infections occur at 1 week of age or more, though infections have been seen as early as 1 day. Calves are often infected at birth by contact with other infected calves or from the cow's faeces.

"Where do they get it from? Rotavirus can remain alive in calf rearing facilities from year to year, in soil and faeces for months, and in water for up to 2 weeks. It can also be transmitted by cats and dogs and other wild animals. It is fairly heat resistant but susceptible to cold. Rotavirus can be confirmed by faecal testing.

"As with any cause of calf scours, treatment always consists of providing energy and fluids, therefore electrolyte therapy is the most important treatment, whilst maintaining milk intakes as well. Specific treatment and prevention of rotavirus involves the feeding of antibodies against rotavirus. This can be achieved by feeding Rotagen powder in the milk, or by feeding the antibody rich colostrum from rotavirus vaccinated animals, to calves for the 1st few weeks of life. To make sure the colostrum contains the antibodies against rotavirus, ALL cows and heifers need to be vaccinated between 3 and 12 weeks prior to calving. If you have a long calving spread vaccination may need to be done in 2 batches and is more successful if the cows have been scanned to establish accurate calving dates.

"The colostrum from vaccinated cows then needs to be fed to calves for as long as possible. The antibodies in the colostrum or milk coat the gut wall and prevent the virus from attaching. If you have had rotavirus scours please discuss vaccination with your vet in May/June [for Australia/New Zealand] next season to make sure your cows are vaccinated at the correct time and you understand what needs to be done to ensure vaccination is successful.

"Bear in mind when dealing with calf scours rotavirus is able to infect humans so hygiene is very important.

"Disinfection every day with Vetsan is recommended when an outbreak of scours is occurring, making sure the floor, walls, calves, and equipment are sprayed. Also you will need to disinfect clothing and boots between infected and non-infected pens, or if possible have a different set of overalls and boots for each."

Scouring calves, weak calves, and even the loss of the calves is very heartbreaking to the owner. We wish this owner and all others great success in overcoming this virus. - Mod.TG
