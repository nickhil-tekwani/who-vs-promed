The sausage maker responsible for the outbreak of trichinosis
originating in the Department of San Justo, which affected 35 people,
has finally been identified. It was a Brazilian citizen. For now, all
of the materials used by this individual have been seized.

The outbreak began in the town of El Tio and later on spread to San
Francisco, where they began to implement controls on all businesses
that sold sausages and on butcher shops.

For now, there have been no more reports of affected individuals.

[This report is most probably a follow up on the initial report of an
outbreak of trichinellosis in Cordoba reported by ProMED on 10 Nov
2010. In the initial report, sausages bought at local markets were
suspected, and this suspicion has now been confirmed.

It is not stated whether the outbreak was due to pork meat alone or
whether it was due to sausages supposed to contain only pork meat
which were then tainted by meat from other sources. If the sausages
were made from pigs raised in the Department of San Justo, the
outbreak shows that there are _Trichinellae_ in the local pig
population used for human consumption. This outbreak illustrates that
the processing of meat without proper veterinary controls poses a risk
of _Trichinella_ infections.
