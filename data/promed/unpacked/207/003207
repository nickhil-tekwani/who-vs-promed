The Government faced criticism from MPs (Members of Parliament) from
all parties after it confirmed that Bernard Matthews will get nearly
BP 600 000 (approx. USD 1.2 million) compensation for healthy birds
slaughtered following the avian flu outbreak.
Some 159 000 turkeys were culled at Bernard Matthews' Suffolk farm to
prevent the H5N1 virus spreading.
The firm will be reimbursed between BP 3 (USD 6) and BP 4 (USD 8) per
bird, depending on their age, by the Department for Environment,
Food, and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). Opposition MPs criticised both the
BP 589 356.89 (approx. USD 1.18 million) compensation and the failure
of a final report into the outbreak published today [20 Apr 2007] to
pinpoint exactly how the infection occurred.
Mr Straw [Leader of the House of Commons] told MPs: "All of us are
uncomfortable about the reports of high levels of compensation to Mr
Matthews' firm."
Defra said compensation was paid to the owners of healthy animals
destroyed due to disease prevention as an incentive for diseases to
be reported early. Defra's final report into the outbreak said the
most likely source of the H5N1 infection was imported turkey meat from Hungary.
Investigators could not uncover any "proven" source for the bird flu
outbreak at the Bernard Matthews plant in Holton, Suffolk, the report said.
The "most plausible" explanation was that the H5N1 virus came from
turkey meat imported from Hungary before the infection came to light
there, according to the National Emergency Epidemiology Group's final
findings. But the report said the possibility of H5N1 going
undetected in turkeys was a "rare event".
The precise source of the bird flu outbreak had not been found
because it was a "...very unlikely occurrence and an isolated event",
the report adds.
Investigators found no evidence of H5N1 in wild birds in Britain or
of undisclosed infection in domestic poultry in Britain. The report
said that the disease broke out in a turkey shed that was in a poor
state of maintenance and occurred within days of 60 kg. (132 lb.) of
breast meat from Hungary being discarded into open waste bins because
it had been dropped on the floor.
Keeping bins uncovered is contrary to hygiene regulations.
There were holes in the woodwork in the shed where the infection
developed and the ventilation vents were not covered in mesh, side
vents were close to the ground, and the roof leaked. The report said
the holes would allow access for wild birds, rats, or mice that could
have carried in the infection. Inspectors found gulls feeding on
scrap meat and loose polythene bags containing waste meat liquid.
The standards of biosecurity for personnel and vehicles were
described as good but the report says risks were caused by "poor
building maintenance."
Debby Reynolds, the chief veterinary officer, said the outbreak at
the Bernard Matthews farm seemed to be the result of "a series of
normally low probability events and circumstances".
An earlier investigation by the Food Standards Agency found no basis
for prosecuting Bernard Matthews over the bird flu outbreak.
The H5N1 virus was reported at the Bernard Matthews poultry farm on 1
Feb 2007 and was confirmed 2 days later.
More than 2500 turkeys died and another 159 000 birds were slaughtered.
Defra will publish a "lessons learned" report about the bird flu
outbreak later this year [2007].
Ben Bradshaw, the animal health minister, said: "Although we cannot
be sure how the outbreak happened, this episode reflects the need for
constant vigilance, high levels of biosecurity and robust and well
developed contingency planning in dealing with animal disease outbreaks."

Executive summary
-----------------
1. Suspicion of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) was reported
on a turkey-finishing site in Suffolk on 1 Feb 2007.
2. Following the service of restrictions, a veterinary enquiry was
carried out and samples were submitted to the National (and
Community) Reference Laboratory, Weybridge on 2 Feb 2007.
Depopulation of the clinically affected birds was completed on the
same day and the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)
H5N1 virus was confirmed on 3 Feb 2007.
3. Depopulation of the remaining birds on the site was completed by 5
Feb 2007 and preliminary cleansing and disinfection by 8 Feb 2007.
The required movement control and surveillance zones were established
in line with European Council Directive 2005/94/EC and
epidemiological investigations were carried out into the possible
source and spread of the disease.
4. The outbreak was confined to a single farm that was adjacent to a
turkey factory comprising a slaughterhouse and 2 processing plants.
Epidemiological investigations into 5 live poultry premises that had
contact with the site during the infectious period through personnel
and vehicles, and surveillance of poultry premises and wild birds
within the restricted zones revealed no evidence of spread of infection.
Epidemiological investigations
------------------------------
5. Extensive investigations have been carried out by the National
Emergency Epidemiology Group (NEEG) comprising:
a. Close examination of the farm and factory premises
b. Detailed review of the records on the farm and at the factory
c. Interviews with staff at the farm and the factory
d. Expert ornithological analysis of wild bird activity in the area,
and potential links with Hungary
e. Expert virological analysis of the HPAI virus recovered from the
outbreak and comparison with viruses of the same strain identified
from previous domestic and wild bird outbreaks
f. Examination of the data requested from and provided by both
Bernard Matthews and the Hungarian authorities
g. Exchange visits between veterinary experts in Hungary and Great
Britain (GB) to share information and examine the data
h. Examination of records of all Hungarian imports of poultry
products to GB during 2006
i. Identification and investigation of all poultry farms potentially
exposed to the infection at Holton farm by either contacts with the
farm or proximity to it.
j. Enhanced wild bird surveillance in the area during February and March 2007
Outcome of investigations
-------------------------
6. This farm was unusual in being sited immediately adjacent to
premises that comprised a turkey slaughterhouse and 2 large poultry
processing plants, and was under the same ownership. However there
was no direct contact between personnel of the 2 sites, which were
managed separately.
7. General standards of biosecurity for personnel and vehicles on the
farm were good, with staff dedicated to particular sheds, controlled
access to individual houses, changes of footwear, and disinfection on
entry, and paved surfaces around the site.
8. Water is supplied to each house from a borehole and stored in
covered tanks preventing contamination by wild bird activity. Feed is
supplied from the company's own feed mill with good vehicle
biosecurity on entrance and exit from the site and on return to the
mill. Storage of the feed and raw materials at both sites would have
prevented contamination by wild bird or rodent activity. In addition,
the production process would have killed any virus had it been present.
9. The disease was confined to a single turkey house (house 10) on
the site (of the 22 sheds that contained turkeys), at the time of
detection. This shed was unusual compared to others on the site in
that it was in a poor state of maintenance. There were holes in the
woodwork (probably rodent damage), the ventilation vents were not
covered in mesh, side vents were close to the ground, and the roof
leaked. These features would allow access for small wild birds, rats,
or mice that could mechanically carry virus into the house, or
ingress of water contaminated by birds outside.
10. Infection was introduced into the affected house between 5 Dec
2006 and 25 Jan 2007. Although the birds were placed in the house on
8 Dec 2006, they were only allowed access to the part of the house
where infection is believed to have entered on 25 Jan 2007. The house
was fumigated (which would destroy any virus present) on 5 Dec 2006.
11. Rodent control was practised routinely on the turkey farm and was
in evidence; however reports of visits from pest controllers show
that despite the control efforts, rodents were an ongoing problem on
the site and particularly in House 10.
12. The virus has been sequenced and shown to be notably similar
(almost 100 percent homologous) to that recovered from the Hungarian
outbreaks in geese in January 2007, and very similar (95 percent
homologous) to certain wild bird isolates in Hungary and UK
(Scotland) in 2006. This level of similarity suggests the virus was
either transferred directly between the Hungarian geese and GB turkey
outbreaks, or that they shared a common source. The similarity of the
viruses recovered in Hungary and the GB suggests either direct
transmission from the Hungarian affected premises, or a common source
that was an as yet undisclosed locus of infection with the same virus
as is associated with the three outbreaks in domestic poultry.
13. The Holton factory received only breast meat from Hungary. Such
tissue can carry an infective dose of virus, if harvested from a viraemic bird.
14. Fresh poultry product received at the factory is either processed
or held in freezers. During the period of risk of infection the meat
was processed on arrival or frozen.
15. There is normally very little waste from the breast meat
processing at the Holton factory as it arrives trimmed; however
occasional waste is created when product is dropped on the floor.
Such an event happened to the consignment that left Hungary on 12 Jan
2007, and was received and handled in GB on 15 Jan 2007, when
approximately 60 kg. (132 lb.) of breast meat was discarded into
waste bins. This particular incident occurred when a box of chilled
turkey breasts was dropped on the floor and was discarded.
16. Analysis of the timing of the Hungarian and GB outbreaks show
that these occurred very close in time and infection could not have
moved from these farms in Hungary to the GB through the normal trade
routes to the Holton factory. The last potentially infected shipment
left Hungary, from the slaughterhouse in Kecskemet, on 12 Jan 2007
(the slaughterhouse was closed for its annual maintenance from 13-20
Jan 2007) and the 1st affected Hungarian premises was most likely
infected after this, between 14 and 16 Jan 2007.
17. The turkeys on the Suffolk farm became infected at the time of
increasing clinical signs and mortality on the 1st Hungarian infected
premises (IP), between 22-25 Jan 2007.
18. There were no Hungarian workers on the farm or the factory site,
and no Hungarian connection could be established beyond the regular
shipments of turkey breasts from Hungary to the factory.
19. There was clear evidence that gulls loafed on the roofs of the
turkey houses, and also flew regularly between the farm and the
factory where they scavenged waste. There was also a clear route by
which pests such as rats and mice can travel between the factory and the farm.
20. Hypotheses for the possible source of infection were:
a. Wild birds, primarily infected migratory species or resident
species infected by migratory species introduced infection either by
gaining access to the shed, or by contaminated feed or other material
that then entered the shed (through normal procedures or carried in by vermin).
b. Introduction from a domestic poultry flock (with undisclosed
infection) in GB by the movement of live birds, personnel movements,
or vehicles.
c. Introduction via personnel who have recently visited countries
with outbreaks of H5N1.
d. Mutation of circulating low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) in
the affected flock.
e. Introduction through other imports of Hungarian poultry products
to other locations in GB and transfer of infected material from other
processing sites
f. Transfer of infection from the January 2007 outbreaks in Hungary,
for which infection from wild birds cannot be ruled out, via the Holton Factory
g. A common ultimate source with recent outbreaks in Hungary,
possibly a wild bird, with infection being carried in turkey meat
imported via the processing plant adjacent to the infected premises
h. The deliberate introduction of infected material from the January
2007 Hungarian outbreaks
21. Epidemiological investigations have provided evidence against
each of the first 6 hypotheses above (a-f) that either refutes them,
or shows them to be very unlikely or implausible.
22. Our joint investigations with our Hungarian counterparts have not
identified a possible source, but we are left with the possibility
that meat products from pre-clinically infected turkeys, infected
from a common source with the Hungarian outbreaks in January 2007,
might have been slaughtered and exported to the Holton site. This is
the most plausible explanation of events.
23. The only alternative explanation, for which there is no evidence,
is the deliberate introduction of material from the Hungarian
infected premises into the affected shed in Suffolk.
Conclusions
-----------
24. Our conclusion is that infection was most likely introduced to GB
via the importation of turkey meat from a sub-clinically infected
turkey flock in Hungary which had been infected from a common source,
possibly wild birds, which may also have infected the 2 goose farms in Hungary
25. Disease surveillance and control measures were effective in
detecting disease early, which limited the potential for spread and
enabled the outbreak to be controlled rapidly.
26. The difficulty in identifying the precise source is probably in
part due to the fact that this is a very unlikely occurrence and an
isolated event that occurred probably in January 2007. The occurrence
of infection in turkeys in Suffolk must be the outcome of a series of
normally low probability events during which, in this case, the
probability of key events was increased. Most potential routes of
infection are controlled through current procedures both in the
industry and nationally/internationally; this was confirmed by the
epidemiological investigations.
27. The incident highlights the importance of good personnel
biosecurity between turkey houses on site, which limited the
outbreak, prior to the confirmation of infection, to a single houses
and also between separate premises which prevented spread of disease
off the site). It also emphasises the importance of implementing
effective animal by-product controls, which could have further
reduced the risk of infection.
28. This outbreak also highlights the risks associated with poor
building maintenance, which can allow the introduction of infection
despite effective biosecurity practices among personnel.
29. There remain uncertainties about the epidemiology of H5N1 infection.
30. The balance of the benefits of adjacent location of commercial
poultry production and processing plants, in terms of protecting
welfare and limiting environmental impact by reducing travelling
time, need to be weighed against the increased risk of disease
transmission, particularly where imported products are handled.

Ideally, every (notifiable) animal disease outbreak is reported
immediately after its initial detection, or even suspicion, leading
to immediate epidemiological investigations, which might unravel the
source of infection. Such a scenario is not overly common. In fact,
and according to this moderator's experience, even if the detection,
notification, and investigation are carried out optimally, the
chances of successfully pinpointing the source of infection remain
low. This situation is seen even in countries with state-of-the-art
veterinary establishment and modern, well-equipped and
well-maintained infrastructure. Two famous recent examples are BSE
(bovine spongiform encephalopathy) and the 2001 FMD (foot-and-mouth
disease) epizootic in the UK, of which the sources of infection
remain unknown or undecided. - Mod.AS
As a MAFF (Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food) alumnus of
some investigative experience I must admit to being disappointed but
at the same time one must defer to those on the sand in the arena.
They can only report on what they saw and found. Logic would state
that birds flying between the farm and the factory where discards
were freely accessible would have played a part, possibly a key part,
but proving such is another matter, especially after depopulation,
massive activities, and factory cleanup. - Mod.MHJ]
