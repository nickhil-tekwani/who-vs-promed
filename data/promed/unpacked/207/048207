USA: stomach flu outbreak spoils San Diego cruise
-------------------------------------------------
A stomach flu spoiled the vacation of passengers on a cruise ship that
ended its 10-day voyage in San Diego. At least 167 of the ship's 1200
passengers and more than a dozen crew members contracted the stomach bug.
It was the 2nd straight trip and the 4th since last May 2006 that the ship
-- known as the Ryndam -- has had to report an outbreak to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. On the Ryndam's last voyage, 110 passengers
became sick, most with diarrhea and vomiting.
Last summer [2006], the ship's passengers had stomach problems resulting
from norovirus infection on 2 different cruises. The Ryndam is operated by
the Holland America cruise line.
