The Davidson County (North Carolina) Health Department confirmed Monday, 30 Dec 2013, they are now investigating reports of illness in 3 children possibly caused by _E. coli_ infection. Two Tyro Middle School students were hospitalized Friday, 27 Dec 2013, with a recent history of severe bloody diarrhea. Both of the children have hemolytic uremic syndrome, a serious kidney complication often caused by certain _E. coli_ infections.

Jen Hames with the Davidson County Health Department said because the 2 children have been treated with antibiotics, lab tests do not pinpoint _E. coli_ as the source that sickened those 2 students. It is still the strongest possibility, she added, but it could be hard to prove because of the antibiotics. On Monday, 30 Dec 2013, a case of _E. coli_ O157 was identified in a 3rd child who has not been hospitalized and does not attend the same school as the 2 hospitalized cases. Right now the Davidson County Health Department is not releasing what school the 3rd child attends. "The 3rd child is not as sick as the other 2 have been," Hames added.

[Since, overall, only 5-10 percent of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ infections result in hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), more cases are likely to have occurred. The 2 HUS cases had been treated with some sort of antimicrobial and such treatment appears to increase the risk of HUS.

Since Wong, et al (1) reported a relative risk of the development of HUS in _E. coli_ O157 infection of 17.3 (95 percent confidence interval 2.2 to 137), it has generally been thought that antimicrobial agents increase HUS risk. In this study, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and beta-lactam drugs were those most linked to HUS. Whether other antimicrobial agents would likewise be linked to HUS, if the same effect would occur in adults, if non-O157 strains would behave similarly and what the mechanism of the effect were not clearly known. Overall, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (also referred to as cotrimoxazole) and fluoroquinolones seemed to be the prime offenders, both not uncommonly used empirically for perceived bacterial enteritis.

As discussed in Kimmitt's paper in Emerging Infectious Diseases (2), the Shiga toxin genes reside on a lambda-like bacteriophage genome integrated into the bacterial chromosome. Different EHEC strains contain various numbers of these phages displaying much diversity and some beginning defective (3). In particular, fluoroquinolones induce high level expression of previously silent bacteriophage genes with coexpression of the toxin genes.

A number of studies have studied Shiga toxin production and/or release using a variety of antimicrobial agents at subinhibitory and/or suprainhibitory concentrations using a variety of markers for toxin. These include direct immunologic measurement, cytotoxicity assays and enzyme reporters. It appears that imipenem (4) and rifaximin (5) do not induce toxin production or phage-mediated cell lysis, suggesting that these agents may not increase the risk of HUS and might be useful in management. Ochoa, et al (5) found that fluoroquinolones induced Shiga toxin induction much more commonly in O157 as compared to non-O157 strains, but Lee and Stein (6) did not.

It seems logical that certain antimicrobials such as imipenem, a broad spectrum carbapenem, or rifaximin, a non-absorbable rifamycin, may be useful in EHEC management. The translation of these studies is, however, yet to be determined and should be considered speculation.
