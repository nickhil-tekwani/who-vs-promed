GROWING RESISTANCE: AN FDA STUDY SUGGESTS RESISTANCE TO ANTIBIOTICS IS
PREVALENT IN CATTLE
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a study this past spring,
suggesting resistance to antibiotics in cattle and other animals is real,
and needs to be watched with growing concern. In this report Linda
Tollefson, at the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine, was quoted as
saying, "The data indicate that there is widespread resistance among the
veterinary isolates, [and that there is a disturbing amount of multiple
resistance [to more than one antibiotic."
Apparently the study tested 3,400 cattle, swine, chicken, turkey and horse
samples positive for non-typhoid Salmonella. The samples came from both
healthy and diseased animals. FDA believes the samples offered a
representative sample of what's really occurring out on farms. All samples
were screened for resistance to 17 antibiotics. Overall, 9% of isolates
were resistant to one antibiotic and 25% were resistant to two or more.
