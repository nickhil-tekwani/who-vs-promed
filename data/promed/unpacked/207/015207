This article about ehrlichiosis in dogs in Western Australia is interesting, but a number of topics were missing from the story. The species of _Ehrlichia_ was not given, but one would assume it was _Ehrlichia canis_, the primary cause of canine ehrlichiosis. Additionally, no tick species was mentioned, but one would assume that _Rhipicephalus sanguineus_, the "brown dog tick", served as the primary vector to the dogs because it is known as the primary vector of canine ehrlichiosis.

If both of these assumptions are true, then the best method of canine ehrlichiosis prevention would be by controlling the _R. sanguineus_ tick population. Furthermore, as _R. sanguineus_ ticks live in close association with their dog hosts, and these are domestic dogs, the control of the tick would involve using an acaricide (such as permethrin) to treat the dog houses, crawl spaces and or floors and walls of homes or other structures/shelters that the dogs spend time in, because these would be the only places (aside from on the dogs) where the live ticks are found. And as brown dog ticks always live close to where their dog hosts live, and are not known to live out in the fields or in the wild countryside that dogs might wander around in, eliminating the brown dog tick population around dog residences should solve the ehrlichiosis/tick problem (that is, unless there is some un-mentioned native Australian tick species playing a role in the _E. canis_ transmission to dogs.

[I would agree with Dr. Gaines statement: "The species of _Ehrlichia_ was not given, but one would assume it was _Ehrlichia canis_, the primary cause of canine ehrlichiosis." The issue with the outbreak does seem to be tick control, as repeatedly the article mentioned rural and indigenous communities. "Dr Cumming said treating the disease in remote indigenous communities was very challenging, especially during the wet season when a single female tick could lay up to 3000 eggs."

The article also stated that the owners were to ensure that the dog was treated with effective tick control.

"Owners of infected dogs are being asked to ensure the dog is treated on effective tick control and to restrict the movement of the dog to reduce the risk of the spread of the disease," she said. "If people suspect their dog is showing signs of the disease, contact your local vet to arrange an appointment."

And further the article noted the advocating for appropriate animal health products to include tick preventatives: "One of the things that AMRRIC has been advocating for is for community stores stocking appropriate animal health products that include tick preventatives; owners should know that disease from ticks can kill their pets, and tick disease can also affect the owner/household members."

I had the sense from the article that the affected stations and individuals had not encountered massive numbers of ticks like this before and likely did not or do not know the dangers to themselves and/or their animals. I agree with Dr Gaines in wishing the article had been more specific. I also hope they get effective tick prevention to these individuals with animals. Australia has effective tick control for dogs, but do they have it available in the areas affected?

Individuals may not be able to afford the most effective tick controls. I agree with Dr Gaines in the sense that this many ticks will take a broad effort to eliminate, to include the pets, the yard, and the houses. Thanks to Dr Gaines for calling out more details about this disease. - Mod.TG
