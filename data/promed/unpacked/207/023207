Foulbrood disease: Discovery aims to fight bee killer
-----------------------------------------------------
University of Guelph researchers hope a new discovery will help combat
a disease killing honeybee populations around the world. The
researchers have found a toxin released by the pathogen that causes
American foulbrood disease -- _Paenibacillus larvae_ (_P. larvae_) --
and developed a lead-based inhibitor against it.

The finding provides much-needed insight into how the infection
occurs, said Rod Merrill, a professor in Guelph's Department of
Molecular and Cellular Biology and a study co-author. It also could
lead to natural and more effective approaches for fighting the most
widespread and destructive of bee brood diseases.

"We are the first to do this," said Merrill, who conducted the study
with graduate student Daniel Krska. Also involved were post-doctoral
researchers Ravi Ravulapalli and Miguel Lugo, technician Tom Keeling,
and Harvard Medical School's Rob Fieldhouse.

American foulbrood is found throughout Ontario and Canada, [and many
parts of the US, and North America in general - Mod.TG] and affects
both the honeybee industry and pollinator populations. Honeybees are
among the world's most important pollinators, and their numbers are
already falling globally because of disease, pesticide use, climate
change, and other factors.

The disease spreads readily through spores transmitted within and
between colonies by adult bee carriers, Merrill said.

Developing larvae are infected by eating the spores. The larvae die
but not before releasing millions of additional spores into the
colony. As well, the hive's weakened state attracts "robber bees"
looking for honey, which then spread the disease to other colonies.

Treating American foulbrood is complicated because the disease has
evolved over decades. "Antibiotics are not working well to contain
it," Merrill said.

"There are antibiotic-resistant strains flying around, so to speak."

The only effective control method is to burn the hive and associated
equipment, as the spores may remain viable for 40 years.

"Antibiotics are failing not only humans but bees as well," Merrill
said.

"Our approach is designing tools that disarm bacteria without killing
them. It does not put pressure on them to mutate because it's not
threatening their survival, it's just saying, 'You cannot hurt us, go
away.'"

The Guelph researchers identified a toxin, C3larvin, believed to be
necessary for the bacteria to colonize a hive.

"Basically, if we can disarm it, it cannot colonize and cannot cause
infection in honeybee larvae. It becomes innocuous," Merrill said.

This initial study only identified and characterized the toxin. "We
don't yet know how important C3larvin is as a virulence factor in _P.
larvae_ in infecting honeybee larvae," he said.

"Once we know what it does, we can inhibit it and that will help
protect the bees from this bacterium that is killing their larvae."

The Guelph team plans to begin field studies on honeybees next spring
[2015] with the Institute of Bee Research in Hohen Neuendorf,
Germany.

The study was published in the December [2014] issue of the Journal of
Biological Chemistry.

Foul brood has been causing problems for honeybee raisers for quite a
long period of time. Now there is also colony collapse disorder
(CCD).

So a few things come to mind from this article:
1. Is this new toxin an outcropping of CCD and foulbrood? Could these
2 agents be in some symbiotic relationship?
2. About the only antibiotic that has been successful against
foulbrood is terramycin (oxytetracycline). There may be a few others
but the effectiveness is much less than that of terramycin. And thus
far it appears to be the only approved treatment.
3. This toxin sounds like it has been identified but not well
characterized. Does the toxin really have an effect? Or is it a
byproduct of the foulbrood agent and not really a toxin in itself?
4. Has this work been repeated? It sounds very preliminary and almost
"pie in the sky' kind of hopes without actual hard mechanistic data to
back up these claims.

We look forward to learning more about this new toxin and its role in
controlling or not foulbrood disease.

American foulbrood (AFB), caused by the spore-forming bacterium
_Paenibacillus larvae_ ssp _larvae_ (formerly classified as _Bacillus
larvae_), is the most widespread and destructive of the bee brood
diseases. Larvae up to 3 days old become infected by ingesting spores
that are present in their food. Spores germinate in the gut of the
larva and the vegetative form begins to grow, taking its nourishment
from the larva. Spores will not germinate in larvae over 3 days old.
Bacterial growth causes the eventual death of the larva. The
vegetative form of the bacterium will die but not before it produces
many millions of spores. Each dead larva may contain as many as 100
million spores.

Terramycin (oxytetracycline) is the only drug approved for use against
American foulbrood. When present in the food given to susceptible
larvae this antibiotic is effective in preventing germination of AFB
spores. The bees are then able to develop and mature normally.
Terramycin will not kill the spores and is not a means for sterilizing
either the bees or the equipment. If a colony contains AFB spores and
is maintained in a healthy condition through treatment with
terramycin, the disease will recur when the drug treatment is
discontinued.

If your bees are in an area where AFB has been reported, if you have
previously-owned beekeeping equipment, or if you have purchased bees
established on comb, it is a good practice to treat with terramycin on
a preventative basis. The terramycin should be mixed with powdered
sugar in a ratio which depends on the strength of the drug: 1 part
TM-5 with 1 part powder sugar, 1 part TM-10 with 2 parts powder sugar,
1 part TM-25 with 5 parts powder sugar, or 1 part TM-50 with 20 parts
powder sugar. The TM rating refers to the number of grams of
oxytetracycline per pound of terramycin. TM-10 contains 10 grams of
active ingredient per pound of terramycin, etc. TM-25 is also referred
to as animal formula soluble powder. Treatment of a beehive consists
of sprinkling 2 tablespoons of the TM and sugar mixture over the tops
of the brood frames.

Preventative treatment should consist of 2 treatments about 1 week
apart in the spring, at least 4 weeks before putting on surplus honey
supers and another one or 2 treatments in the fall after taking off
the honey supers.

To treat a diseased colony, apply 3 to 4 treatments of the TM-sugar
mixture at about weekly intervals. If these treatments must be done
during the summer with the honey supers on, they should be left on the
colony over the winter for bee feed because the terramycin will get
into the honey supers and therefore contaminate the honey.

Diseased colonies that do not respond to 3 or 4 treatments of
terramycin should be destroyed. Diseased colonies that must be
destroyed can be killed with resmethrin insecticide that comes in an
aerosol can and is available from bee supply dealers. Bees should be
killed at a time when there is no flight. The frames and combs should
be burned in a pit and the ashes covered. The heavy woodenware
(supers, tops, and bottoms, etc) may be sterilized by scraping them
clean (the scrapings should be burned) and scorching the inside
surfaces.

The scorching can be done with a propane torch; particular attention
must be paid to cracks and corners. If large quantities of supers are
to be scorched they may be stacked and painted inside with kerosene
and lit. Keep a cover handy to extinguish the flames when the wood is
sufficiently scorched. To sterilize large quantities of equipment, it
might be worthwhile to set up a barrel with a boiling lye solution of
1 lb. of lye to 10 gallons of water. The woodenware should be immersed
in the solution and boiled 5 to 10 minutes or until clean. Frames may
also be sterilized in this manner. Lye is a very caustic solution; use
extreme care in this process.

Most beekeepers who have had any experience with AFB in their hives
will agree that the best approach is to treat with terramycin on a
preventative basis and inspect colonies regularly. Colonies that show
signs of AFB should be destroyed and the equipment sterilized.

No method of treatment for AFB is completely effective for permanent
control. Beekeepers should inspect their colonies regularly and always
be alert for possible recurrence.
