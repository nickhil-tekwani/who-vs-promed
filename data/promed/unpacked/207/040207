An outbreak of H5N8 bird flu has been detected at a hen farm near the town of Nykoping in eastern Sweden, the country's board of agriculture said on [Tue 25 Apr 2017].

The authorities have taken steps to contain the outbreak of the disease, imposing a 3 km [approx. 1.8 mi] safety perimeter and banning visits to the farm. All or parts of the hen population would be destroyed, the agriculture board said in a statement.

Sweden eased restrictions on bird farms earlier this month [April 2017]. Bird flu was detected at a Swedish hen farm in December 2016 and has also been found in several wild birds in the country.

According to the said report, which includes also a map, the outbreak started on [Sat 22 Apr 2017] on a farm with laying hens. The farmer noticed increased mortality in 1 of 4 houses. The 4 houses were however considered as one epidemiological unit.

"Total animals affected

Birds / 50 000 / 12 500 / 755 / 49 245 / 0

"Epidemiological comments: A protection zone (3 km) [approx. 1.8 mi] and a surveillance zone (10 km) [approx. 6.2 mi] have been put in place around the infected farm. Euthanizing and destruction of all the animals will be performed including disinfection of all the facilities. All other restrictions and necessary measures according to Directive 2005/94/EC are applied, including a prohibition of transportation of live birds, hatching eggs and non heat-treated poultry products in this area".

Since the start of the HPAI H5N8 event in Sweden, reportedly on [Fri 21 Nov 2016], a total of 6 outbreaks in poultry have been recorded, with the following accumulated statistics (derived from WAHID reports archive):

Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered

With temperatures rising and the bird migratory season terminated, the 2016/17 winter's HPAI H5N8 event may be approaching its end. - Mod.AS
