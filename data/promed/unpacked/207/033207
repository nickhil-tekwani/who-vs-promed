2010 has been pretty bad, and yield is down almost 50 percent from
2009, said a farmer. Dry conditions have not just reduced crops. They
have damaged them. "You can see there's some mold on it," he said,
grabbing an ear of corn.

The mold produces aflatoxin, and already it is wiping out thousands
of bushels of local crops, specifically corn. Many farmers are just
beginning their harvests, and already the mold has claimed 2 percent
of the crop. It is the 1st time in 12 years area farmers have
reported such high numbers.

Agriculture agents report the mold is stress related and comes as a
result of this summer's [2010] dry growing conditions. The problem is
becoming so widespread, local graineries are checking every few
loads, just to be on the safe side. "You're allowed 20 parts per
billion for the export corn, and if it is above that, they reject
it," the farmer explained. It is a costly scenario for local farmers,
he said, and "a little devastating." For now, it appears the best
thing to do with the damaged corn is bury it.

[Several species of _Aspergillus_ can cause ear rots of maize in the
field. Of these, both _A. flavus_ and _A. parasiticus_ produce
mycotoxins known as aflatoxins. The species are mainly saprophytes,
degrading dead tissue of any origin, and are, therefore, important in
nutrient recycling, but they may also become pathogenic. Stress (for
example by drought, as described above) increases the susceptibility
of maize plants to _Aspergillus_ ear rots. Infection is characterised
by powdery masses of spores on and between kernels. Only a few (often
injured) kernels, often close to the ear tip, may be infected.
Occasionally, infected kernels may not show any symptoms but only
appear dull and discoloured. Economic losses are mainly due to
contamination of grain with aflatoxins.

The fungi can be spread with soil, water, infected plant and other
materials, on air currents or by mechanical means (including insect
activity). They also have great significance as post-harvest
pathogens, especially when grain is stored under high humidity
conditions which will enable the continued growth of the fungi.
Disease management may include cultural practices to improve plant
vigour, control of insect pests to reduce damage to emerging ears,
and ammonia treatment of stored grain, but use of resistant maize
cultivars is considered the most effective approach.

The amount of fungus present is not a reliable indication of the
levels of aflatoxins in harvested grain, since different pathogen
strains may vary in their efficiency to produce mycotoxins.
Therefore, harvested grain needs to be tested. Aflatoxins can cause
severe poisoning in animals and humans and are also potent carcinogens.
