A health official in Eastern Equatoria said they received reports of 8 suspected cholera cases in Torit town, marking the spread of the disease from Juba [in Central Equatoria]. The Catholic Radio Network, which has a station in Torit, quoted the state director of primary health care Ercillia Akulu as saying that 2 of the 8 cases were confirmed to be cholera. He said the state formed an emergency response taskforce including officials from the border town of Nimule to contain the cholera outbreak.

Akulu revealed that other taskforces in the counties are on standby and that the WHO deployed officials with vaccines and other drugs to Nimule Hospital.

Over 1700 cases of cholera have been treated in South Sudan since the outbreak started, with most cases in the capital city Juba.

[2] Sudan: denial of cases

The Sudanese Health Ministry denied rumors of a cholera outbreak in areas near the border with South Sudan. In a statement to the press, the ministry said they have already established disease surveillance posts to test refugees fleeing into South Kordofan and White Nile states.

The ministry said South Sudanese refugees who were living in Kilo Ashara area in White Nile were relocated to an alternative site due to shortages of basic services, saying they have been provided with enough aid for 3 months in coordination with the Sudanese Red Crescent Society.

In Khartoum, local authorities reportedly gave 10 days for South Sudanese nationals encamped at Azuzab and Shejera residential areas south of the capital city to relocate to new camps 45 km [28 mi] outside the capital.

Khartoum State Governor Dr Abdurrahman El Khidir announced the establishment of the new camps after consulting with the speaker of the state legislative assembly El Fateh Izz al-Din. The Khartoum Locality Commissioner said the decision was taken following complaints by local residents over disagreements with refugees and alleged environmental pollution in the 2 areas.
