COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Portuguese authorities have uncovered a case of
so-called "mad cow" disease (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, BSE) in a
cow imported from Denmark, the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration
said in a statement Wednesday.
Although it could not be ruled out the cow had caught BSE before it left
Denmark, the case did not constitute a risk to Food safety there, said the
organization. The cow was born in Nordvestjylland, Denmark in March 1992
and was exported to Portugal in October 1994 from a herd of only 16, none
of which was still in Denmark. While Portugal has reported 13 new cases of
BSE so far this year and registered 170 cases in 1999, the first case of
BSE in a native Danish cattle herd was announced in late February.
A number of countries immediately announced bans on Danish beef and Denmark
pulled beef products from its shelves. The Danish government admitted March
1 it had failed to follow EU guidelines fast enough to prevent the first
case. Denmark had previously been criticized by the European Union for
acting half-heartedly on recommendations to prevent BSE, with the
government proving unwilling to test dead or sick animals, or introduce new
methods in abattoirs.
Until this year, Denmark believed its cattle were free from BSE, the only
previous case having occurred in 1992 -- an import from Scotland aroused
little domestic concern. Denmark has two million head of cattle.
