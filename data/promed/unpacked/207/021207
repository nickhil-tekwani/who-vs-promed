No case of H5N1 bird flu virus in France
----------------------------------------
ProMED-mail's posting "Avian influenza (57): France, swan
20080406.1259" indicated wrongly new cases of H5N1 bird flu virus in
France. This information comes from an old issue of BBC News, dated 5
Jul 2007, 09:04 GMT (at <http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6272574.stm>).

The French Ministry of agriculture and fisheries indicates that there
is actually no case of H5N1 bird flu in France.

[It is relieving to note that no H5N1 infection has been recorded in
French wildlife during 2008; we apologize for any inconvenience
caused by the error.

We are also grateful to Dr Joseph Dudley for the following
complementary observations, pertaining to the commentary in the said posting.

The ADNS (Animal Disease Notification System) database information
cited (addressing the 11 1st weeks of 2008) should be updated; wild
waterfowl of 2 taxa other than swans (ducks, geese) have been
confirmed with H5N1 from 2 countries in Europe during 2008, as follows:

1. A dead Canada goose (_Branta canadensis_) recovered in Dorset,
England (UK) during February 2008 tested positive for H5N1 [appears
to be incorrectly cited as swan case no. 11 in the ADNS report];
source: <http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7271351.stm>.

2. A live common pochard (_Aythya ferina_) trapped at Lake Sempach in
Switzerland during late March 2008 tested positive for H5N1 [reported
after ADNS report was last updated]. Source:
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=6917>.

Dr Dudley is kindly acknowledged. The UK case was officially reported
by Defra (UK Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs) on
29 Feb 2008 (press release Ref: 66/08;
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2008/080229c.htm>), as follows:

"Defra has today [29 Feb 2008] confirmed that a Canada goose
collected on 25 Feb 2008 in the Wild Bird Monitoring Area in Dorset
as part of wild bird surveillance has tested positive for highly
pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza [HPAI]. The bird was found less than
one km from where the previous positive cases in swans were collected.

"This is the 11th wild bird with highly pathogenic H5N1 in the area.
The previous 10 cases were in wild mute swans, with the last case
being confirmed on 4 Feb 2008".

No additional cases have been detected in Dorset since 25 Feb 2008;
on 27 Mar 2008, more than 30 days after the last case, Defra
announced (press release Ref: 91/08;
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2008/080327d.htm>) that the "Wild Bird
Monitoring Area and associated disease control restrictions put in
place following cases of H5N1 avian influenza in wild birds in Dorset
will be lifted" as from 14.00 same day. - Mod.AS]
