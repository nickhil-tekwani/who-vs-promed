Rare typhoid fever spread at Qdoba restaurant in Colorado
---------------------------------------------------------
3 cases of life-threatening typhoid fever have been confirmed in Colorado. CBS Denver reports all 3 of the people sickened with the bacterial infection had eaten at a Qdoba Mexican Grill in Firestone in August 2015. Although the outbreak happened in August 2015, the 3 illnesses were just reported in recent weeks because incubation of the infection and diagnosis take time, said state epidemiologist Dr Lisa Miller, from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.

The infected customers came down with headaches, fever and other symptoms. "2 of these 3 people were actually hospitalized, so they were quite sick," Miller said. All the patients have now recovered, CBS Denver reported.

According to Miller, tests of employees showed the source of the illness was an infected food handler at the Qdoba who spread the _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhi bacterium. The employee reportedly showed no symptoms of illness.

How did it get into the food? "Someone sheds it in their feces and contaminated food or directly contaminated something that somebody else ingests," Miller said.

"The good news is that worker is no longer handling food at the restaurant," Weld County Health Department spokesperson Eric Aakko said. "We are still doing some follow-up investigation with former employees of the restaurant to rule out anyone else who may have become sick," Aakko said. "The restaurant is being very cooperative with the investigation so right now our department and the state health department feel comfortable that there's no need to close the restaurant."

Miller said there is no evidence of any ongoing health risk.

Typhoid fever is rarely acquired in the USA and can be deadly. CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] says about 5700 cases are reported in the USA each year, mostly in travelers who contracted the bacteria overseas. The disease is commoner in developing countries, where it often spreads through contaminated food and water.

The illness is treated with antimicrobials, although some strains are becoming resistant. There is also a vaccine for typhoid fever which is recommended for some international travelers.

Health officials in Colorado said the state averages about 5 cases a year.

[Enteric fever caused by _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhi has a totally different presentation from that of the commoner kinds of salmonellosis. Epidemiologically, typhoid is not a zoonosis like the more commonly seen types of salmonellosis. Clinically, vomiting and diarrhea are typically absent; indeed, constipation is frequently reported. As it is a systemic illness, blood cultures are at least as likely to be positive as stool in enteric fever, particularly early in the course of the infection, and bone marrow cultures may be the most sensitive.

The symptoms of classical typhoid fever typically include fever, anorexia, lethargy, malaise, dull continuous headache, non-productive cough, vague abdominal pain, and constipation. Despite the often high fever, the pulse is often only slightly elevated. During the 2nd week of the illness, there is protracted fever and mental dullness, classically called coma vigil. Diarrhea may develop, but usually does not. Many patients develop hepatosplenomegaly. After the 1st week or so, many cases develop a maculopapular rash on the upper abdomen. These lesions ("rose spots") are about 2 cm in diameter and blanch on pressure. They persist for 2-4 days and may come and go. Mild and atypical infections are common.

The word typhoid (as in typhus-like) reflects the similarity of the louse-borne rickettsial disease epidemic typhus and that of typhoid fever; in fact, in some areas typhoid fever is still referred to as abdominal typhus. - Mod.LL
