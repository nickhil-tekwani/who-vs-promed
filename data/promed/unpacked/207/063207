A horse in central New York has been euthanized after suffering with neurological signs associated with eastern equine encephalitis (EEE).

The disease is considered one of the most serious mosquito-borne virus [infections], and horses are almost always killed by it. The animal in the Town of Trenton [Oneida County] was put down last Monday [8 Sep 2014].

The New York state health department recommends that horses be vaccinated for the disease. In humans, it can produce symptoms ranging from mild flu-like illness to inflammation of the brain, coma, and death in about a third of those affected.

Currently, there is no vaccine for humans.

Oneida County health officials tell The Oneida Daily Dispatch they've been routinely testing mosquito pools in western sections of the county but had seen no positive specimens.

Oswego County Health Department announced today [17 Sep 2014] the horse, stabled on state Route 49 in Constantia, died 10 Sep 2014. 2 other horses in Schroeppel and Palermo also died of EEE last month [August 2014]. In Madison County, a horse died of EEE 6 Sep 2014 in the town of Lenox.

The department also said 5 additional mosquito samples collected last week [week of 8 Sep 2014] tested positive for EEE. 3 of the samples were from the town of New Haven, 1 from the town of Albion, and 1 from near the village of Central Square [Oswego County].

EEE is nearly always fatal in horses. It's rare in humans, but often deadly. There have been 5 reported human EEE deaths in New York state since 1971, all of them in Central New York.

While there is no vaccine against EEE for humans, there is a vaccine for horses.

State officials are advising horse owners to make sure they get their animals vaccinated.

[New York has an abundance of EEE cases this year (2014). There has been plenty of rain and therefore plenty of breeding grounds for the mosquitoes that carry the disease.

What is surprising is that the majority of media reports do not mention anything about encouraging owners to vaccinate. They mention a vaccine is available for horses but no encouragement or admonishment to vaccinate the horses.

Regardless of the state, if rabies is required in a state, then EEE and WNV should be required for horses. If communities are able to organize a rabies drive to vaccinate animals, then a community should likewise organize a drive to vaccinate horses.

The EEE virus is transmitted from mosquitoes to horses or to humans. Humans cannot catch the virus from a horse.

Owners are strongly encouraged to vaccinate their horses. This is a deadly disease and a simple vaccine can be life saving.
