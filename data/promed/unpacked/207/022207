Wild birds can be ruled out as the cause of the bird flu virus outbreak at
a French turkey farm [during February 2006], with an inquiry into the case
underlining the need for strict hygiene controls, food agency AFSSA said on
Friday. "In view of the way the animals were confined in this farm, the
entrance of wild birds into the building as a source of contamination seems
very unlikely," AFSSA said in a summary of its inquiry released on its
website. "The animals' contamination very likely had an indirect origin,"
it added.
An AFSSA spokeswoman added that the virus could have been carried into the
building by a domestic pet, via farm equipment or by humans. This showed
that strict hygiene controls were needed.
At the end of February 2006 France discovered an outbreak of the deadly
H5N1 bird flu virus at a farm in the department of Ain, which had more than
11 000 birds. The case marked the first and only time so far the virus has
spread to domestic farm birds in the European Union. It dealt a heavy blow
to France's poultry industry, worth 6 billion euros [USD 7.2 billion] a
year, with sales falling some 30 percent after the discovery. Since then
French poultry sales have recovered slightly and are now around 7-10
percent down on the same period of 2005.
In an additional sign that the bird flu scare may be waning in France, the
French farm ministry said on Friday the security zone around the infected
turkey farm would be lifted on Monday, 4 days earlier than originally
planned. A ministry official said the authorisation had been given by the
European Commission in light of the progress made to control the spread of
the disease.

Domestic Ducks and H5N1 Influenza Epidemic, Thailand, Thaweesak Songserm et
al, EID Vol. 12, No. 4 April 2006
Abstract: In addition to causing 12 human deaths and 17 cases of human
infection, the 2004 outbreak of H5N1 influenza virus in Thailand resulted
in the death or slaughter of 60 million domestic fowl and the disruption of
poultry production and trade. After domestic ducks were recognized as
silent carriers of H5N1 influenza virus, government teams went into every
village to cull flocks in which virus was detected; these team efforts
markedly reduced H5N1 infection. Here we examine the pathobiology and
epidemiology of H5N1 influenza virus in the 4 systems of duck raising used
in Thailand in 2004. No influenza viruses were detected in ducks raised in
"closed" houses with high biosecurity. However, H5N1 influenza virus was
prevalent among ducks raised in "open" houses, free-ranging (grazing)
ducks, and backyard ducks.
