Bangladesh: increase in dengue fever cases
------------------------------------------
DHAKA: Dengue is again on the rise with the monsoon shedding its farewell
drizzles over the city. Empty cans and containers with accumulated fresh,
stagnant water in them are the ideal breeding places for the _Aedes_
mosquito, the vector of dengue.
There is also alarm in the Dhaka Medical College (DMC) dormitories as more
than 20 medical students and doctors [have contracted dengue fever in the
past 2 weeks, and 5 of them are still being treated in the hospital.
Students of Dhaka University and Bangladesh University of Engineering and
Technology (BUET), who live in the vicinity of the medical college, are
also getting infected.
"The possibility of contracting dengue was in my mind when I got fever and
I thought of checking my blood count, but the fever was so severe that I
could not go out to the laboratory", said Dr Nazmul Huda, a resident of the
hostel who is being treated at the DMCH for dengue fever. "I became afraid
when I saw rashes all over my body and did my platelet count", said Dr
Huda. He was admitted immediately to the hospital as the count went below
25 thousand per cubic milliliter. "I have severe abdominal pain and
vomiting tendency with the fever. The anorexia and nausea are still
persisting even though 7 days have passed since the fever began," the
doctor said about his own experience of dengue fever.
Raisul, a fourth year student of the college, developed severe abdominal
pain and cough on the third day of his fever. He experienced one episode of
passage of black stool and was restless when he reached the hospital. The
doctors suspected [that he was suffering from dengue hemorrhagic fever.
"At least 10 adult patients have been coming to the DMCH every day over the
last few weeks, 50 per cent of them with hemorrhagic manifestations," said
an intern doctor of the hospital. "The number is not less even in the
children's wards," he added. "Dengue fever has changed its manifestations
this year in Dhaka," said Dr Mesbah Uddin Noman of the hospital. "The
patients are getting fever, rash and bleeding simultaneously unlike
[descriptions in textbooks or what we have seen last year," he added.
"Usually in dengue hemorrhagic fever, bleeding starts with the fall of
temperature," Dr Noman said.
"The other dengue-prone areas of the city are Khilgaon, Goran, Green Road,
and Mirpur, as most of the dengue patients being admitted to DMCH are from
those areas," said another intern of the hospital. "A mosquito control
drive, [undertaken by the Dhaka City Corporation, is ineffective and
knowledge of the people about the transmission of the fever is also
inadequate," said Dr Shahidul Islam, assistant professor of microbiology of
DMC. "Dengue is particularly a pre-monsoon and post-monsoon disease,
because the _Aedes_ mosquito, loves to breed in fresh stagnant water. Rain
water remains stagnant for several days in small discarded containers [at
these times of the year due to infrequent rain", said the microbiologist.
"We should intensify our mosquito control drive in the pre-monsoon and
post-monsoon seasons to prevent dengue transmission," he said.

Nicaragua: 2 die from dengue hemorrhagic fever
----------------------------------------------
MANAGUA: This week 2 people died from dengue hemorrhagic fever in
Nicaragua, bringing to 13 the number of deaths related to the disease so
far this year, Health Ministry spokeswoman Tamara Montes said.
The health authorities are concerned about the rise in the number of cases
of dengue hemorrhagic fever compared with this time last year, when only 5
deaths and 96 suspected cases had been reported. At 257, the number of
cases reported so far this year is nearly three time the year-to-date
figure for November 2000. One of those who died this week was a resident of
Managua, which has the highest number of dengue cases in Nicaragua, while
the other death took place in the province of Leon, 90 kilometers (about 55
miles) west of the capital.
Between January and the first week of November, 1481 cases of the more
common classic dengue fever were confirmed, whereas only 759 were
registered in the same period last year, Montes added. According to
ministry officials, another 8516 people suspected of having dengue were
examined in health care centers. The health authorities have recommended
prevention measures for major cities, specifically the elimination of
breeding grounds for the mosquitoes that carry the virus, such as flooded
areas and water containers.
