Science, Al-Zahra University, Tehran, Iran. Plant Dis 2001; 85:1290.
Published on-line as D-2001-1016-01N, 2001. Accepted for publication 27 Sep
2001.
During the summers of 1999 and 2000, 3110 [leaf samples from soybean
(_Glycine max_) ... were randomly collected from soybean fields in the
Ardebil, Goletan, Khuzestan, Lorestan, and Mazandaran provinces of Iran.
Tomato spotted wilt [tospovirus (TSWV) was detected in [the ... samples
by TSWV-specific polyclonal antibody (As-0526 and As-0580, DSMZ,
Braunschweig, Germany) in ... DAS-ELISA.
Mechanical inoculation of 26 [test plant species (10 plants per species)
and cultivars with extracts of ... leaf samples [positive for TSWV
[induced necrotic local lesions in _Beta vulgaris_, _Chenopodium quinoa_,
_C. amaranticolor_, _Gomphrena globosa_, _Phaseolus vulgaris_ cv. Talash,
_Vicia faba_, and _Vigna unguiculata_ cv. Mashad; ... systemic chlorosis
followed by necrosis in _Datura stramonium_, _D. metel_, _Nicotiana
rustica_, _N. tabacum_ cv. Samsun, _N. glutinosa_, _N. benthamiana_, and
_Glycine max_ cv. Hill; and ... chlorosis, stunting, and bud necrosis in
_Arachis hypogaea_ (peanut).
[Symptomatic [test plants developing these symptoms ... were positive in
ELISA for TSWV. ... Overall incidence of TSWV [in soybean in the 5
provinces was 5.4 per cent.
TSWV has been reported in potato (2) and tomato (1) from Iran, but to our
knowledge, this is the first report of the occurrence of TSWV on soybean in
Iran.

[With reports that TSWV has infected potato and tomato in Iran, it is
likely that the virus has become established in wild plant species and thus
can be expected to infect other crop plants. The virus is distributed
worldwide and can cause moderate to severe damage in many crops monitored
by ProMED-Plant. A good description of the virus and its properties can be
obtained in the following article: Brunt AA, Crabtree K, Dallwitz MJ, Gibbs
AJ, Watson L, Zurcher EJ (editors) (1996 onwards). Plant Viruses Online:
Descriptions and Lists from the VIDE Database. Version: 20th August 1996.
