SCREWWORM - PANAMA: ALERT

The cattle industry in Panama has been placed under red alert after it was
discovered that some of the flies used to stop the reproduction of the
much-feared screwworm had not been sterilized in a plant in Chiapas, Mexico
that produces the species.
Panama received information that one third of the flies sent to the country
had not been adequately sterilized because of a failure in the system. For
this reason, it is impossible to exclude the possibility of human or cattle
infection in the eastern region of the country, near the border with Colombia.
This is the first time that something of this nature has occurred.
Yesterday, the Panama-United States Commission for the Eradication and
Prevention of Cattle Screwworm (COPEG) declared a state of general alert,
and specific measures in accordance with the procedural guidelines for the
management of epidemics and outbreaks are being implemented. Such measures
include increased dispersal of sterile flies and field surveillance by
technical personnel who will visit farms and collection points.
In addition, COPEG has increased the frequency of inspection of all sites
where the mobilization of animals is controlled. Since 1997, COPEG has
invested 50 million dollars in the program of eradication and prevention of
cattle screwworm and foot and mouth disease.

[The screwworm, which infests both animals and humans, is the larva of the
dipterous fly _Cochliomyia hominivorax_. To date, no other morphological
variants or diverse species have been described in North, Central, or South
America, or the Caribbean.
Human and animal infestation occurs when the females lay eggs around the
edges of exposed wounds. The eggs hatch and larvae infest. The primary
screwworm is frequently confused with the non-pathogenic secondary
screwworm (sp. _C. macellaria_) because of morphological similarities;
however, the clinical implications of the 2 species are different.
In the United States, the screwworm existed in tropical and semi-tropical
environments until 1983, when it was eradicated from the continental
landmass. Its geographical distribution extended to the neotropical and
neoarctic regions during the warm and cold months, including the states of
Florida, Texas, and California. The disease is endemic in all of Central
and South America, with high incidence along the coastal plains of Central
America.
The eradication of the disease in the USA and most of Mexico has been
possible through the massive dispersion of sterile males in endemic areas
and areas of outbreaks. The sterilization of male flies is accomplished via
irradiation with gamma rays. The sterile males mate with wild fertile
females, resulting in the production of non-viable eggs, thus breaking the
life cycle of the insect. This technique is most effective during periods
of low fly population. Another vital part of the program is intensive
concurrent surveillance, with inspection campaigns and distribution of
information among cattle farmers. - Mod.JT]
