The recent report on ProMED (Jamestown Canyon virus, mosquitoes - USA (NY)
20040805.2137 ) of the discovery of Jamestown Canyon virus (family
_Bunyaviridae_, genus Orthobunyavirus) in Clinton County, New York, should
serve as a reminder to us all that the wheel is being reinvented every
day. The occurrence of this virus in New York State is well-known, and
this virus has been shown to infect large numbers of people throughout the
eastern U.S. (1-4).

Not only is institutional memory being lost as funding for laboratories
fluctuates, depending on politics and need, but it appears that fewer
people read the literature these days, depending entirely on hearsay or
what they can find on PubMed.

In recent years, in response to "managed care" and "cost savings",
suspected bacterial and viral infections often are treated empirically,
without cultures or further laboratory investigations. The patient is given
whatever antibiotic is all the rage and told to return if symptoms persist.
After greater than 50 years of academic advancements, this paradigm should
be considered [lower] quality [where more sophisticated resources are
available]. It might be eye-opening were hospitals to perform cost-benefit
studies on the benefit to the patient of treating without lab results.

As more and more infections are being "discovered" and considered
"emerging" or "reemerging", it would do the discoverers well to determine
whether all s/he knows is all there is to know. Worse, targeted
surveillance, e.g., for West Nile virus alone, or for whatever the disease
du jour may be, allows the less glamorous, less prevalent agents to slip
through the cracks. Worse, there may be agents of disease, such as
Jamestown Canyon virus and Cache Valley virus (5), which are not looked for
and therefore are not found as etiologic agents. If we do not knock, the
door will not be opened.

[Drs. Calisher and Grimstad are raising some very valid points above. A
key issue here seems to be "seek and ye shall find". In ref. 2 cited
above, the authors sought and found: among 780 Michigan residents tested
for neutralizing antibodies to California serogroup viruses, 216 (27.7
percent) were found to have specific neutralizing antibody to Jamestown
Canyon virus.

It does appear as though the increased surveillance in response to West
Nile virus activity in the USA is having the beneficial outcome of further
identifying other viral agents in our environment that have been absent
from the collective radar scope outside of academic-oriented
institutions. In the clinical arena, the diagnosis of "viral syndrome" is
one of the most common for self-limited febrile illnesses, which are rarely
studied further as to etiology, unless it is an unusual presentation or
more severe illness. But even then -- as is suggested above -- there are
more severe illnesses that still go undiagnosed in terms of etiologic agent.

The bean counters would argue the cost-benefit ratio is against diagnostic
testing in the absence of agent-specific treatment modalities. Methinks
there's a mid-point that has yet to be reached in this debate -- the
current "all or nothing" choices seem less than adequate. - Mod.MPP]
