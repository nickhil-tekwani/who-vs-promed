Horse in Ogden area has deadly disease -- equine piroplasmosis
--------------------------------------------------------------
Utah's state veterinarian has confirmed one case of a rare and deadly
disease in a horse in the Ogden area. But he said that horse is
currently under quarantine and the owner understands that there are
severe penalties in place to keep him from moving that horse to where
the gelding could spread the disease. "The horse is not able to leave
the premises," said Bruce King, the state vet. "No other horses are
allowed [onto] the premises."

King said an outbreak of equine piroplasmosis was localized to 3 Texas
counties [Jim Wells, Kleberg, and Brook counties], but a ranch there
had sold a number of horses around the country before the disease was
discovered. He said the Ogden-area horse was one of those horses.

Owners of the infected horse, he said, intend to euthanize the animal
but are waiting because they are seeking recourse from the ranch that
sold it to them. "The owner is waiting to see what the ranch has
guaranteed it will do to make things right," King said.

King said he is sure he will know if any other horses become infected
because all Utah veterinarians are required to report any animals that
become infected. He said there are stringent rules on reporting of
diseases considered foreign. Veterinarians risk losing their license
if they do not report such cases.

King said outside of areas where ticks may pass the disease from
animal to animal, it is usually transmitted only by an exchange of
blood, such as through shared needles. He said once a horse is
infected, there is no treatment and the animal will be a carrier for
the rest of its life.

As of 20 Jan 2010, 364 cases of equine piroplasmosis had been
confirmed. Of those, 289 are on the sprawling King Ranch in Texas. The
rest are scattered across Utah, Texas, Alabama, California, Florida,
Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, North Carolina, New Jersey, Tennessee
and Wisconsin, according to the World Animal Health Information
System. Jack Hunt, King Ranch CEO, confirmed that the outbreak started
on the ranch, according to Scripps-Howard News Service.

Horses, donkeys, mules and zebras are susceptible to the disease,
which is caused by [either of] 2 parasitic organisms. More severely
affected animals can have fever, anemia, jaundiced mucous membranes,
swollen abdomens and labored breathing. Once a horse is infected, the
parasitic organisms remain in the horse's system permanently, making
the horse a potential carrier. It does not affect humans or other
non-equine mammals.

Hunt, who has been in the ranching business for 35 years, said he had
never heard of the disease before it was discovered in the USA in
October [2009].
The 825 000-acre King Ranch is renowned for its horses, including 1946
Triple Crown winner Assault and 1950 Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes
winner Middleground. Though the ranch still has a horse-breeding
program, no horses have been sold since the quarantine, Hunt said.
Hunt said King Ranch self-reported the infection, as required by law,
and has worked openly with state and federal agencies since.

Update on equine piroplasmosis disease investigation
----------------------------------------------------
The Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) continues to investigate the
spread of equine piroplasmosis from a South Texas ranch, which was 1st
detected in October 2009. Equine piroplasmosis is a tick-borne
protozoal infection of horses. At least one species of tick,
_Amblyomma cajennense_ has proven capable of transmitting the blood
parasite. This species of tick is endemic to South Texas and several
other southern states.

Further research is underway to determine if there are other tick
species capable of transmitting the parasite. The disease may also be
spread between horses by unsafe animal husbandry practices such as
sharing needles or equipment that is contaminated with blood.

While piroplasmosis can be a fatal disease, many horses may display
vague signs of illness, such as fever, loss of appetite or jaundice.
Horse owners are advised to consult a private veterinarian to discuss
tick control, management practices, or any concerns about illness.
Several states have imposed interstate movement restrictions on horses
from Texas, so owners and veterinarians are urged to call the state of
destination before moving horses.

"TAHC field personnel are still investigating how many animals may
have been exposed or infected with this disease," said Dr. Dee Ellis,
Texas' state veterinarian and executive director of the Texas Animal
Health Commission, the state's livestock and poultry health regulatory
agency. "22 percent of the 1728 horses that have been tested are
positive," he said.

In almost every case, the positive horses disclosed were directly
traced to the index ranch or had contact with positive horses from the
ranch. Dr. Ellis added that because of that fact, there does not
appear to be a geographic correlation to the presence of the disease,
but rather a correlation to exposure with positive horses. "This is
not a widespread South Texas outbreak," Dr. Ellis went on to state.

The TAHC and USDA officials continue to trace, identify and test
animals on a prioritized basis. The priorities include, 1) "direct
traces" of horses that lived on the ranch, 2) "dangerous contacts"
which are horses that visited the ranch, or whose dam was infected,
and 3) "cohorts" which are horses that have lived with positive
animals. At this time, horses living on premises adjacent to the index
ranch are being tested on a voluntary basis only, since this does not
appear to be a geographic outbreak.

In January [2010], TAHC hosted a meeting with 32 representatives from
20 Texas equine industry groups to discuss the status of piroplasmosis
in the state. Risk procedures for positive and exposed horses were
discussed, and input sought on how the state should further respond in
terms of surveillance, movement requirements, and identification of
positive horses.

[This disease is now clearly established in the USA and needs to be
treated as an endemic national problem. - Mod.MHJ]

[Equine piroplasmosis is present in South and Central America, the
Caribbean (including Puerto Rico), Africa, the Middle East, and
Eastern and Southern Europe. Only the United States -- until October
2009 -- Canada, Australia, Japan, England and Ireland are not
considered to be endemic areas. - Mod.JW]
