Health officials in Norway are reporting an _Escherichia coli_ O157: H7 outbreak that has sickened 6 people since June 2018. The 6 patients reside in different counties: Akershus, Oslo, Vestfold, Hordaland, and Trondelag. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health is cooperating with the municipal health service, the Norwegian Food Safety Authority, and the Veterinary Institute to investigate whether the patients may have a common source of infection.

Interviews are being conducted with the patients, and samples from the homes are being taken to find the source of infection, if possible. Investigative work can be complicated and take time, and in many cases it will not be possible to find the source of infection or to clarify whether it is a common source," said Solveig Jore, senior adviser at the National Institute of Public Health.

The _E. coli_ O157: H7 bacterium can cause diarrhea, occasionally bloody. This can last for 4-10 days in adults and slightly longer in children. In rare cases, the bacterium can cause the serious complication of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). HUS, a serious kidney disease, is due to poison-producing EHEC bacteria (the bacterium produces so-called Shiga toxins).

[Although initially associated with undercooked ground beef, the enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ strains (either the prototypic O157 strains or otherwise) are zoonotic organisms linked to ruminants, especially cattle. Transmission can be from undercooked meat; contaminated produce such as lettuce, tomatoes, and sprouts; recreational or municipal water; and person to person. The vehicle for transmission is not established here. Any information would be welcome. - Mod.LL
