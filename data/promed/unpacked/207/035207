Botulism has occurred in Uganda, the US-based Centers for Disease
Control (CDC) confirmed after tests done on a high school student who
died in October 2008. The Ministry of Health said that a senior
student at Seeta High School in Mukono district, 20 kilometers (12.4
mi) east of the capital Kampala, died of botulism, a disease, which
last was reported in the landlocked East African country 30 years ago.

"The test results from CDC in Atlanta, USA, on the 2 cases admitted
at Mulago Hospital last month [October 2008] confirmed botulism,"
said Dr Sam Zaramba, the director of general health services, in a
statement on Tuesday [18 Nov 2008].

"Current evidence from the investigation suggests that the foods
consumed by the affected girls a few hours or days before the onset
of the illness was contaminated by the botulism toxin," Dr Zaramba said.

The ministry ruled out earlier speculation that the deceased student
must have been a victim of food contaminated by poison at her Seeta
High School's kitchen. "If it was the case there would have been many
more cases among the student population," the health ministry announced.

Since the confirmed test, epidemiologists and other health
specialists at CDC and World Health Organization (WHO) are carrying
out further investigations to establish the potential source of intoxication.

[Confirmation requires neutralization tests to be done, which would
additionally identify the serotype of botulinum toxin involved in
this small outbreak. The rapid deterioration and death of the student
suggests that serotype A was involved. - Mod.LL]
