YELLOW FEVER - CAMEROON (02)

My colleague, Justin Fombe, working in the Cameroon Baptist Convention
Health Board, has the following reply to your inquiry about yellow fever in
that country:
"I have not heard anything about an outbreak of YF in Cameroon. Maybe there
is something like that, but I have called a few people to find out and they
reply in the negative. If you are receiving reports that contradict this,
please let me know. Incidentally, as a Canadian, my local public health
department still recommends YF vaccination before travelling to Cameroon,
or to any part of Western Africa for that matter."

[The outbreak (1 non-fatal case) was confirmed by WHO in the 14 Jan 2005
edition of the Weekly Epidemiological Record (WER) Notifications of
diseases received from 7 to 13 January 2005:
<http://www.who.int/wer/2005/en/wer8002.pdf>.
The fact that an officially confirmed case of YF could be unknown to an NGO
involved with health in the country points to the need for a complementary
reporting system such as ProMED-mail. The ProMED-mail model is a low-budget
system easily implemented in any country, particularly one that is
resource-poor. We appreciate the cooperation of Justin Fombe and Paul
Webber. - Mods.JW,MPP,CP]
