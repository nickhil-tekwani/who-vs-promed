Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive, horizontal spread through water
Epidemiological comments: Fisherman observed a large number of fish-eating birds crowding along the river banks. On close inspection, they noted that the birds were eating fish. A fisherman reported observing fish swimming sluggishly and crowding to the edges of the water along the bank. This was reported to the Department of Wildlife and National Parks, who upon investigation confirmed the incident. Freshwater fish of different species were observed to swim slowly in the shallow water along the river bank. Inspections of the fish, which were mainly fingerling size and slightly bigger, were observed to have intense inflammatory lesions, red areas on the skin, deep ulcerations, and deaths. Though the number of susceptible animals was estimated at 10 000 in this report, the actual numbers are unknown for each species. Further, a large number of dead fish and sick ones were being quickly eaten by birds making the counts for deaths and morbidity very inaccurate but the large numbers of birds indicated a far more serious problem probably high morbidity and mortality than estimated in this report. Laboratory examination and results are pending on the 91 specimens submitted for diagnostics at the National Veterinary Laboratory.

Control measures
Measures applied: surveillance outside infected and/or protection zone; surveillance within infected and/or protection zone; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: movement control inside the country quarantine; emergency harvest

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Botswana National Veterinary Laboratory (National laboratory) / Squicker (_Synodontis_ species) / histopathological examination/ - / Pending

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[Epizootic ulcerative syndrome, or 'red spot disease' is quite a serious ulcerative disease of many (more than 100) species of freshwater and estuarine fish. The causative agent of red spot disease is a fungus, _Aphanomyces invadans_. The overall impact of red spot disease on wild stocks of fish is uncertain, although high losses in juvenile stocks are known to occur.

The fungus is not known to cause disease in humans. However, advanced lesions in fish sometimes contain bacteria that potentially cause disease in humans. Therefore, people should not eat diseased fish.- Mod.PMB
