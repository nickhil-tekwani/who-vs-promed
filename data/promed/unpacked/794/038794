E. COLI, GROUND BEEF RECALL - USA (NEBRASKA)

An Omaha meat company recalled more than 80,000 pounds of ground beef
suspected of being tainted with a deadly strain of the _E. coli_ bacteria,
the company said Tuesday.
There were no reported illnesses linked to the meat, according to All
American Meats Inc President Shawn Buchanan.
Buchanan said most of the 82,929 pounds of ground beef was sold and
apparently consumed in Illinois, Indiana and Michigan. About 40 boxes of
the meat, packaged for use by retailers, was still on the market and has
been recovered, he said.
The voluntary recall was ordered by the company after USDA inspectors found
a positive sample of the _E. coli_ 0157:H7 bacteria Monday. The positive
sample of ground beef was collected from product already on hold at a Jewel
Food Store warehouse. Last week, Jewel recalled 500 lbs of ground beef
after a routine USDA check found _E. coli_ 0157:H7 contamination.
The virulent strain of _E. coli_ can cause bloody diarrhea, kidney failure
and death in children, the elderly and others with weak immune systems.
The U.S. Agriculture Department said the packages of meat, sold in 10-pound
lots, were produced on April 14 and stamped with a "sell-by" date of April
28. Each package also was printed with "Est. 20420" indicating the plant
where it was produced.
