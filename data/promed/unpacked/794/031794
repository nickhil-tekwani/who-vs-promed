A suspected case of [a] hantavirus infection involving a 39 year old man was detected in recent hours [of Wed 31 Jan 2018] in Osorno province.

The warning signs of the case were several complaints of the patient who went to the San José Hospital with a high fever, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting and headache.

He then underwent an examination and a rapid test, that according to the Osorno Health Services, where positive for hantavirus [infection] symptoms [and positive rapid test?]. It is believed that he could have acquired the infection in the lake area of Puerto Octay, where the patient visited a few weeks ago.

His case was coordinated with the reference center of the southern area, arranging his move by ambulance to the Hernán Henríquez Aravena Hospital in Temuco, where he arrived this [Wed 31 Jan 2018] morning, remaining in stable condition in the Critical Patient Care Unit without respiratory difficulties.

Initially the Health Service confirmed this as a case of [a] hantavirus [infection], but minutes later went on to correct that, classifying it as a "suspicious case", in a discrepancy with the health authority that awaits the [definitive] laboratory results.

[Apparently, the patient's illness is stable and has not evolved into the serious hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome. The specific situation under which the individual acquired his hantavirus infection is not confirmed. He likely came into contact with areas inhabited by the rodent reservoir of the virus.

Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, including the Los Lagos region, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year.

Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and if it does is only with very close physical contact, usually within the family. The commonest source of the infection is the long-tailed pygmy rice rat. Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg. - Mod.TY
