Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza in France: H5 non-N1
-----------------------------------------------
1. Disease Report
The French authorities have recently reported an outbreak of Low
Pathogenicity Avian Influenza (LPAI) on a duck breeding farm in
Vendee region [see map at the above URL. - Mod AS]. The birds were 12
months old and at the end of their moult. Preliminary testing
confirmed the virus to be of the H5 type (but not N1) [later
identified as H5N3; see commentary. - Mod.AS]. Disease control
measures have been put in place, including a 1 km restriction zone.

2. Situation assessment
Sporadic findings of LPAI are not uncommon across the EU. This
particular [H5N3] strain in France appeared to have caused about one
percent mortality in the affected flock. Infection with LPAI in ducks
and geese is generally asymptomatic. However, in this specific case,
the ducks may have been more susceptible to infection due to stress
associated with moulting. According to TRACES (the EU electronic
trade notification system), there have been 24 consignments of live
poultry from France to the UK since 1 Jan 2009. One consignment
originated from the Vendee region; however, it came from a holding at
least 45 km away from the affected premises, and it was for turkeys.

[According to the French notification to the OIE submitted on Wed 4
Feb 2009, the mentioned outbreak, caused by LPAI serotype H5N3, had
started on 29 Jan 2009 and resolved already on 1 Feb 2009, when the
entire affected holding was stamped out. The final diagnosis was
confirmed on 1 Feb 2009 by AFSSA's (France's food safety agency)
national laboratory at Ploufragan. The location was Les Brandes, La
Garnache, Vendee. A map is included; see
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=7764>.
The notification included the following description of the affected
population: "The affected farm has only one closed premises with
about 5000 breeding ducks in late moult (no lay) and aged 12 months.
Thu 29 Jan 2009: signs of prostration. 50 birds found dead. Fri 30
Jan 2009: 25 birds found dead. Sat 31 Jan 2009: 15 birds found dead.

the following epidemiological comments: "Source of the outbreak(s) or
origin of infection - unknown or inconclusive. No recent entry of
poultry on the farm. No recent exit of poultry or eggs from the farm."
