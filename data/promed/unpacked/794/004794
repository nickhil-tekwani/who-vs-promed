Yellow fever is caused by a virus carried by mosquitoes, and it is a common disease in South America and in sub-Saharan Africa.

Cases from the yellow fever outbreak in the Darfur region of western Sudan continue to rise, as the World Health Organization (WHO) Sudan reports 266 suspected cases in 20 localities, according to the WHO news release of 9 Nov 2012. Of the 266 cases, 85 fatalities have been reported, which equates to a case fatality rate of 32 per cent.

According to surveillance data, Central Darfur is still the hardest hit area, accounting for 73 per cent of all cases. This is followed by West Darfur (12 per cent), South Darfur (11 per cent), with North and East Darfur accounting for the remainder.

Member of Parliament Ibrahim Abbaker said last week that the outbreak in Darfur has reached "epidemic levels" that require immediate intervention from the central government.

The Ministry of Health in the capital city of Khartoum has even reported the emergence of the 1st case of the mosquitoborne viral disease in the Sudanese capital, according to a Radio Dabanga report on Saturday [10 Nov 2012].

The yellow fever vaccination plan, which will cover 3 587 772 persons in the age group 9 months and above, has been finalized. However, this depends on the reconfirmation of the diagnosis by the reference laboratory, the Institute Pasteur, in Dakar, Senegal, according to a WHO Situation Report on Friday [9 Nov 2012].

To date, more than 100 medical doctors and medical assistants have been trained in South Darfur on disease surveillance, case management, outbreak investigation, and infection prevention and control.

WHO says the 266 suspected cases have presented to health facilities with common symptoms, including fever, bleeding, and vomiting in 99, 64 and 58 per cent of the cases, respectively.

The yellow fever outbreak has now affected 20 localities in Central, South, West, and North Darfur. As of [8 Nov 2012], 266 suspected cases have been reported, including 85 deaths (case fatality rate of 31.8 per cent).

Reports have been received since the last week of September 2012 from the districts of Zalengei, Nertity, Wadisalih, Azoom, Mukjer, Bendisi, Nyala, Kass, Kubum, Sharq Agabal, Yassin, Mershingm, Rehaid Albirdy, Genaina, Kernik, Baidha, Habila, Forbranga, Saraf Omra, and Alseraif.

Surveillance shows that 72.9 per cent of the reported cases are from Central Darfur; 10.9 per cent are from South Darfur; 12 per cent are from West Darfur; 4.1 per cent are from North Darfur, and 0.1 per cent are from East Darfur.

WHO has been assisting the technical support teams deployed by the Federal Ministry of Health in Central, South and West Darfur for initial support and to conduct outbreak investigations, initiate responses, entomological surveys, active case searches, and to hold meetings with community leaders in affected areas to raise awareness, as well as to provision blood bank supplies and personal protective equipment to affected states.

To date, health cadres in affected areas have been vaccinated against yellow fever. Moreover, WHO and the Ministry of Health have started training programmes for more than 225 health staff in the affected localities on yellow fever surveillance, case management, outbreak investigation, and infection prevention and control. On [6 Nov 2012], training programmes for medical doctors on yellow fever surveillance, case definition, and management started in Nyala and Kass localities in South Darfur.

[The number of cases in Darfur continues to rise. One wonders about the delay in getting lab results; perhaps there was a delay in the specimens reaching Dakar. - Mod.JW

In the 1st report on this outbreak covered by ProMED-EAFR (see Yellow fever - Sudan: (Darfur) 20121103.28571503), there were a total of 84 suspected cases, including 32 deaths, reported in the districts of Azoom, Kass, Mershing, Nertiti, Nyala, Wadi Salih and Zalingei during the period 1-31 Oct 2012. The above reports increase the number of suspected cases to 266 with 85 fatalities reported from 20 localities in Sudan and mention the start of reports in the last week of September 2012.

Information on the epidemiologic investigations would be greatly appreciated, including dates of onset of cases along with epidemic curves.
