The Public Health Agency of Canada is collaborating with federal and provincial public health partners to investigate an outbreak of _Escherichia coli_ O157. A specific source or product has not been identified yet, and the investigation is ongoing. The Agency will update Canadians when new information becomes available. At this time, the risk to Canadians is low. However, Canadians are reminded to follow safe food handling practices to avoid illness.

Ongoing Investigation
-------------------
There have been 31 cases of _E. coli_ with a matching genetic fingerprint reported in Alberta (1), Ontario (11), Quebec (17) and Nova Scotia (2). Individuals became sick between 6 Jul 2015 and 4 Sep 2015, with the peak of illnesses reported to date occurring between 25 Jul and 1 Aug 2015. The majority of cases (52 percent) were male, with an average age of 25 years. Seven cases have been hospitalized, but all have recovered or are recovering.

The Public Health Agency routinely investigates multi-provincial gastro-intestinal illness outbreaks, including _E. coli_. The purpose of each investigation is to determine whether illnesses are linked to the same source.
