Colombia prepares for coconut "disease squeeze"
-----------------------------------------------
The spread of the devastating red ring disease in the south of the country
and in neighboring Ecuador, combined with the threat in the north from the
spread of the virulent lethal yellowing disease from Central America, means
coconut producers are facing an assault on 2 fronts.

Red ring disease has already killed up to 80 per cent of coconut palms in
the south western departments of Narino and Cauca. In some of the areas you
can see field after field of palm stumps. Now experts fear that it is only
a matter of time before lethal yellowing disease, which has already killed
millions of coconut palms across Mexico, Honduras, and Jamaica, reaches
South America.

CIAT, with USAID, the Yucatan Center for Scientific Research (Mexico), and
national organizations, are developing methods for rapid testing for
resistance to red ring disease and are also investigating possible genetic
resistance to lethal yellowing in the tall [variety] palms native to Mexico.

[2] Lethal yellowing - Mozambique

Lethal yellowing affects 110 000 hectares
-----------------------------------------
Lethal yellowing disease of coconut palms in Mozambique's Zambezia province
is affecting the survival of residents in some of the province's districts.
Authorities said that an area of 110 000 hectares [about 272 000 acres] was
affected by the disease, with a level of infestation of between 22 and 28
per cent of the total area.

Over 70 000 diseased palms had been cut down and replaced by over 100 000
saplings. According to the Zambezia provincial government, the new palms
seem to be resistant to the disease, particularly the variety that was
imported from the Ivory Coast.

In 2009, the Millennium Challenge Account provided USD 17.4 million to
fight the disease over 5 years. 15 per cent of the Zambezia population is
dependent on coconut palms for their survival.

[3] Cape St Paul's wilt - Ghana

More coconut trees planted in Western Region
--------------------------------------------
The Zoil Eco Brigade Project is planting more coconuts along the beaches of
the Western Region, including the Shama, Ahanta West, Ellembelle, Jomoro,
and Nzema East Districts.

So far about 2300 coconut trees have been planted to replace trees planted
earlier but lost due to the Cape St Paul's wilt disease. The maintenance of
the coconut trees is key to the coastal environment and will also provide a
source of livelihood for the coastal dwellers.

The project aims at planting thousands of coconut trees along the beaches
of the country hoping to achieve a target of one million trees in the near
future.

[Red ring
---------
Red ring disease of palms is caused by the nematode _Bursaphelenchus
cocophilus_. Around 20 species of tropical palms are known to be affected,
the most important crops being coconut, oil, and date palm. The disease was
first described in Trinidad in coconut palms in 1905 where today it kills
an estimated 35 per cent of coconut seedlings. It has been reported from
areas of Central America, South America, and many Caribbean islands. Red
ring is considered one of the most important palm wilts with an estimated
annual yield loss of 15 per cent to coconut and oil palm industries in
affected areas.

Symptoms may vary with host species, but generally include a several
centimeter wide reddish ring visible only when the trunk is cut, followed
by leaf distortion with or without discolouration and necrosis, crown
reduction, stunting, and almost always death of the palm. The nematodes
live mainly in the trunk tissue of the red ring, but the reason for this
confinement is not yet known. The American palm weevil _Rhynchophorus
palmarum_, which is attracted to fresh trunk wounds, appears to act as a
primary disease vector, although additional weevils and other insects may
also be involved for certain areas or palm species.

Disease management relies mainly on techniques to reduce vector numbers and
sources of nematode inoculum, such as phytosanitation, vector trapping,
insecticides, and selective elimination of infected palms.

Lethal yellowing
----------------
Lethal yellowing (LY) diseases are caused by phytoplasmas of the palm
lethal yellowing (LY or 16SrIV) group. A number of LY strains have been
described from the Caribbean, Latin America, Africa, and southern Asia. LY
has seriously jeopardised coconut industries in the respective areas and
can also affect a large number of other palm species. Symptoms include
premature nut drop, blackening of inflorescences, yellowing of fronds, and
death of the palm usually within 4 to 6 months. The planthopper _Myndus
crudus_ is suspected to be the vector in the Americas, but different
vectors may be involved in the spread of LY strains elsewhere (for example,
Mozambique). Seed transmission of the pathogens cannot be excluded and some
weed species may serve as reservoir hosts. Commercial control of LY relies
on replanting with resistant varieties, but an unexplained resistance
breakdown of some widely used Malayan Dwarf hybrids is causing great
concern. Reasons for the breakdown are still uncertain.

In Mozambique, LY has been spreading continuously in the coastal coconut
belt to the north and south of Quelimane in Zambezia province.
Nevertheless, substantial areas still remain LY free and quarantine
measures are in place to restrict movement of coconut planting material.
According to item 2 above, there now appears to be some success with
replanting certain varieties in LY affected areas.

Cape Saint Paul wilt
--------------------
Cape St Paul wilt (CSPW) disease is caused by a phytoplasma tentatively
assigned to the palm lethal yellowing 16SrIV group. The disease was thought
to be a localised problem in Ghana, but since 1985 new disease foci have
developed at an alarming rate in the major coconut-producing areas of the
Western and Central regions. CSPW is now perceived as a major threat to
coconut plantings also in neighbouring Ivory Coast.

A research programme on the epidemiology of CSPW was launched in 2007 to
provide information for the development of management strategies. No insect
vector could be identified with certainty so far, but preliminary evidence
suggests that species of _Derbidae_ may be involved in the spread of LY in
Tanzania and possibly also in CSPW spread in Ghana.

In Ghana, despite major efforts only one fifth of the coconut plantings
devastated by CSPW could be restored so far. According to the report in
item 3 above, replanted palms have again been killed by CSPW. It is not
stated which varieties or hybrids were used in that 1st replanting attempt
and whether the 2nd round of replanting is using different cultivars. It
remains to be seen whether the new plantings will again succumb to CSPW.
