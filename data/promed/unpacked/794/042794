Three people have died following the outbreak of anthrax in the Balungu electoral area of the Bongo district in the Upper East region.

Several animals have also died from the disease, which has been in the community for the last 2 weeks.

The Assemblyman for the area Edward Abesiwine, who disclosed this outbreak to Radio Ghana, said officials from the Ministry of Agriculture are in the community to vaccinate animals against the disease. Mr Abesiwine appealed to the government and philanthropists to go to the aid of the people, since some cannot afford the fee being charged for vaccination.

Two more people have been reported dead in fresh cases of anthrax in the Upper East region following a vaccination exercise which was thought to have brought the situation under control, after 2 people and 20 cows died from an outbreak of the deadly infection at Gogo in the Bawku West district last month [April 2012]. The latest deaths, which take the number of dead to 4, occurred at Balungu in the Bongo district.

Regional Veterinary Officer Dr. Thomas Anyorikiya told Joy News that they suspect the latest victims may have consumed an infected carcass and have, therefore, resumed vaccinations. "The soils are contaminated. ... If the carcasses were not properly buried, it means they opened the carcasses, prepared the meat and consumed it, thereby contaminating their soil. This is the education we have been giving. Once you open the carcass and contaminate the soil, you can expect anthrax to be there for the next 25 years, at least."

[These livestock and human deaths reinforce Dr. Anyorikiya's concerns in a previous posting: see 20120518.1137531. The duration of soil contamination depends very much on its pH and calcium content. As this region is such a persistent source of reports, we can assume it has the characteristics of a black steppe soil, high pH (over 7), high calcium levels, plenty of organic humus.
