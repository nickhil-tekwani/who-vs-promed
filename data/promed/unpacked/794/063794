A 2nd beef cattle herd, in the Veluwe [a forest-rich ridge of hills within the Dutch province of Gelderland] is, almost certainly, infected by bovine tuberculosis [bTB]. This relates to one out of the 3 farms which had contact with the farm in Gelderland declared as infected in mid-December 2012, where the remaining 13 cattle have been culled. That farm had purchased animals from a Belgian farm where bovine TB was established. In one of the contact farms on the Veluwe, a number of animals tested bTB positive. The diagnosis has yet to be definitely confirmed by the laboratory.

The Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority tested, during the last month, 17 other cattle which had been imported from Belgium beef farms suspected or infected with bTB. In one case, infection with bTB was discovered.

[According to OIE data, the previous occurrence of bTB in the Netherlands was reported in Nov 2011.

The requirements from a country to qualify as free from bTB are stipulated in OIE's terrestrial Code, article 11.6.2., available at http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.11.6.htm. As long as the country maintains the bTB-freedom in at least 99.8 percent of the herds and 99.9 percent of the cattle, its national nTB-free status recognition is maintained.

A final confirmation of the case is anticipated. - Mod.AS
