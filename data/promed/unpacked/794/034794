Chagas Disease After Organ Transplantation -- Los Angeles, California, 2006
-----------------------------------------------
Chagas disease is an infection caused by the parasite _Trypanosoma
cruzi_. Reduviids (i.e., "kissing bugs") transmit the parasite
through infected feces. _T. cruzi_ also can be transmitted
congenitally and through blood transfusion or organ transplantation.
The infection is lifelong if left untreated; the majority of infected
persons are asymptomatic, and their disease remains undiagnosed.
Although routine serologic testing of organ and blood donors is
performed in areas of Latin America where Chagas disease is endemic,
no _T. cruzi_ screening test is licensed in the United States.
However, seroprevalence studies using research tests have documented
the presence of _T. cruzi_ antibodies in U.S. blood (1) and organ
donor populations (2). This report describes 2 cases of acute Chagas
disease in heart transplant recipients reported by 2 Los Angeles
County hospitals in February 2006. In the United States, one previous
report documented _T. cruzi_ transmission through solid organ
transplantation, in which 3 organ recipients were infected (3).
Case Reports
Case 1. In December 2005, a man aged 64 years with idiopathic
cardiomyopathy received a heart transplant. In January 2006, he was
treated with enhanced immunosuppression for suspected organ
rejection. In February 2006, he was re-admitted to the hospital with
anorexia, fever, and diarrhea of 2 weeks' duration. A peripheral
blood smear revealed _T. cruzi_ trypomastigotes; blood cultures were
positive for _T. cruzi_, and endomyocardial biopsy specimens
contained amastigotes. The patient was interviewed about natural
exposures, and organ procurement and transplantation records were
reviewed. He had no identifiable risk factors for _T. cruzi_
infection (e.g., travel to a country endemic for Chagas disease). He
was seronegative for _T. cruzi_ antibodies but positive for _T.
cruzi_ DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), indicating recent
infection. After initiation of nifurtimox therapy, his parasitemia
rapidly cleared. However, in April 2006, the patient died from
complications attributed to acute rejection of the transplanted organ.
To identify the source of infection, a traceback was conducted on all
blood products transfused to the heart donor and recipient. All
available blood donors tested negative for _T. cruzi_ antibodies by
immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and radioimmunoprecipitation assay
(RIPA). However, blood from the organ donor tested seropositive for
_T. cruzi_ antibodies by RIPA and tested borderline-positive by IFA.
The organ donor had been born in the United States but had traveled
to a _T. cruzi_-endemic area of Mexico.
Three additional patients received a liver and both kidneys from the
same donor. These patients are _T. cruzi_-seronegative by IFA and
have no evidence of parasitemia by PCR. They continue to be monitored.
Case 2. In January 2006, a man aged 73 years with ischemic
cardiomyopathy received a heart transplant. The patient was
readmitted to the hospital in February 2006 with fever, fatigue, and
an abdominal rash. A thin blood smear revealed _T. cruzi_
trypomastigotes, and blood cultures were positive for _T. cruzi_.
Organ procurement and transplantation records were reviewed. The
patient had no identifiable risk factors for _T. cruzi_ infection. He
was seronegative but PCR-positive for _T. cruzi_, indicating recent infection.
The patient's rash and parasitemia resolved after 10 days of
nifurtimox treatment. Serial endomyocardial biopsies did not reveal
trypanosomes, and he remained seronegative by IFA for _T. cruzi_. The
patient died in June 2006. The primary cause of death was cardiac
failure; no autopsy was performed.
The source of infection was investigated with the same methods used
for case 1. All available blood donors tested seronegative for _T.
cruzi_. The organ donor, who had been born in El Salvador and was
residing in Los Angeles at the time of his death, tested positive for
_T. cruzi_ antibodies by RIPA but had a negative IFA. 3 other
patients received solid organs from the same donor. These patients
are _T. cruzi_-seronegative by IFA and have no evidence of
parasitemia by PCR. They continue to be monitored. No record of
previous blood donations by either organ donor was found.

MMWR Editorial Note:
The 2 cases described in this report are the 4th and 5th cases of
reported _T. cruzi_ transmission through solid organ transplantation
in the United States. The prevalence of infection with _T. cruzi_ in
the United States varies by region and might now be higher than
previously thought, especially in geographic areas such as Los
Angeles County, where a substantial proportion of blood and organ
donors have emigrated from Chagas-endemic countries. Because organ
donors frequently receive blood transfusions, infection can be
transmitted to recipients either by transfusion or transplant.
Currently, no policies recommend laboratory screening for _T. cruzi_.
Diagnostic tests available for research studies have variable
sensitivities and specificities, and no licensed screening test exists.
Physicians and laboratory personnel should maintain a high index of
suspicion for _T. cruzi_ infection in transplant and transfusion
recipients who exhibit complications of an unknown etiology when more
common sources have been excluded. Acute Chagas disease in severely
immunocompromised patients is of special concern because the clinical
course is often severe and rapidly progressive. If Chagas is
suspected, manual microscopic examination of peripheral blood smears
should be performed. Patients with acute Chagas disease should be
treated as early as possible in the course of the infection.
Available treatments include nifurtimox (available from CDC Drug
Service, telephone 404-639-3670) or benznidazole (only distributed
outside of the United States).

[Transmission of _Trypanosoma cruzi_ by solid organ transplants and
blood transfusion from persons born and raised in endemic areas is a
long-recognized problem. Also, persons born outside endemic areas by
infected mothers can be infected in utero with congenital
_Trypanosoma cruzi_ and may remain infectious. The key message is
that as long as there is no accepted algorithm for testing solid
organs or blood donors, there will be a risk for transmission by
transplants or blood donation. - Mod.EP]
