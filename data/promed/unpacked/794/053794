A variety of viruses are to blame for the ongoing early ripening of tomatoes in Maharashtra [ProMED-mail post 20200514.7337673], a report by the Indian Institute of Horticulture Research (IIHR) stated. Farmers reported early ripening, yellowing and distortion of fruits, which ultimately led to massive crop loss. Visual inspection had not shown any indication of pest attacks.

The Agriculture Department had sent samples to IIHR [which were] tested for 12 major viruses. They tested positive for _Cucumber mosaic virus_ (CMV), _Groundnut bud necrosis virus_ (GBNV), _Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus_ (ToLCNDV), _Tobacco vein distorting virus_ (TVDV), _Tomato chlorosis virus_ (ToCV), and _Tomato mosaic virus_ (ToMV).

The report has recommended setting up a special investigation to study the problem in depth. Suhas Diwase, Agriculture Commissioner, said a special team of scientists will be constituted to come up with practices for tomato growers in the state.

[The viruses identified above and their main routes of transmission are:
_Cucumber mosaic virus_ (CMV; _Cucumovirus_), transmitted by more than 60 species of aphids;
_Groundnut bud necrosis virus_ (GBNV; _Tospovirus_), transmitted by thrips;
_Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus_ (ToLCNDV; _Begomovirus_), transmitted by white flies;
_Tobacco vein distorting virus_ (TVDV; _Polerovirus_), transmitted by aphids;
_Tomato chlorosis virus_ (ToCV; _Crinivirus_), transmitted by white flies;
_Tomato mosaic virus_ (ToMV; _Tobamovirus_), no known specific insect vectors, transmitted by seed and mechanical means.
For more information on the viruses see links below and previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives.

It is not stated above whether multiple viruses were found in single samples, or whether different viruses were present in different plants, but in the scenario described, co-infections in at least some of the plants appear likely. Multiple viral or viroid infections are common in field plants with the potential for synergism (symbiotic enhancement of disease). If additional infections occur over a number of crop cycles, the virus population will gradually build up, both in number of co-infecting (possibly synergistic) virus species and in amounts of infectious units per virus species. This invariably leads to severely reduced plant vigour and a dramatic drop in yield.

For example, it is thought that combinations of various pathogens may have contributed to the general decline of citrus health in the region due to accumulation of parasitic pathogens in old orchards over time (see ProMED-mail post 20170109.4750640). A similar situation may have developed for tomato planting stock. Tomato seeds are traded widely and are known to pose a risk for spreading viruses and other pathogens (for example, ProMED-mail post 20140122.2222560). Use of certified clean seeds or tomato transplants is crucial and certification programmes for the crop would be needed to address the problems above.
