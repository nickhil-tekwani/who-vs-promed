Outbreak of Salmonella Typhimurium infection among traveling US students
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Queensland Health and OzFoodNet are continuing to investigate a recent outbreak
of _Salmonella_ Typhimurium [_S. enterica_ serotype Typhimurium - Mod.LL]
infection among visiting students aged 10 to 13 years and teachers from
southeastern Virginia and North Carolina [USA]. In total, 31 students and 3
teachers were affected from the touring group of 44, who had been traveling
through Queensland by bus and have now returned to the USA.
The epidemiological investigation has identified that infection was
probably foodborne, and the most likely vehicle of transmission was
an egg-based dessert served at one of the restaurants the group
attended. 28 of the 34 cases were hospitalized, and 19 cases were
laboratory-confirmed as _Salmonella_ Typhimurium (phage type
pending). This appears to be an isolated incident. Assessment of
recent Queensland data has not indicated an increase in serotype
Typhimurium cases.
Queensland Health has been working with the restaurant owners and
produce suppliers, who are cooperating fully, to investigate the
reasons the contamination occurred and to ensure the problem does not
occur again. There were no leftover food samples of this particular
food dish available for microbiological testing. The investigation
into the source of the salmonella contamination is continuing.
