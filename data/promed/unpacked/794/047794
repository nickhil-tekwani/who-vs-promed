This week, a Chinese man has been confirmed with the historic black death disease. According to Jimu News, on [Tue 19 Jul 2022], a case of black death, or bubonic plague, was confirmed in the General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University. His family was taken to isolation and inspection overnight. The patient's community was briefly shut down on the evening of the following day. But restrictions were lifted on 21 Jul 2022 after sterilization [spraying of insecticides?] was conducted.

The patient, a 45 year old herdsman living in Shanghai Temple Ranch, Inner Mongolia, started to experience fever, fatigue, unconsciousness, and diarrhea on 12 Jul [2022]. He was admitted to a local hospital the next day and transferred to another on 14 Jul [2022].

According to China News Network, plus the one case detected so far in 2022, there have been 11 confirmed instances of plague over the past 4 years. The clinical manifestations of plague infection are high fever, swollen and painful lymph nodes, cough, expectoration, dyspnea, bleeding, and other symptoms of severe toxemia.

[Plague is caused by _Yersinia pestis_.

Most cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea, causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a "bubo." Although the term bubonic plague is used in the post, no mention of swollen lymph nodes is given, suggesting perhaps septicemic plague instead.

Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being bitten.

When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antimicrobial therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. At this stage, person-to-person spread can occur, causing other cases of "primary" plague pneumonia. A quarantine would be required with contact tracing, and even prophylactic antimicrobials, if the index case or cases actually had plague pneumonia.

Plague is endemic in Mongolia. Marmots such as the Tarvaga, the Tarbagan or Mongolian marmot, _Marmota sibirica_, a large rodent related to the American woodchuck (_M. monax_), are thought to be significant zoonotic reservoirs for _Y. pestis_ in Eastern Asia. The name marmot comes from French marmotte, from Latin _mures monti_, or "mountain mouse". - Mod.LL
