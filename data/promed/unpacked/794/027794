A muscle relaxant appears to have been mixed mistakenly with measles vaccine, killing 15 children in Syria this week, the World Health Organization said Friday [19 Sep 2014], calling it the biggest such tragedy in memory.

The WHO said it could not completely rule out sabotage, so the measles inoculation campaign remained suspended until the investigation was finished.

15 children died after being vaccinated against measles in northern Syria, aid workers said Wednesday [17 Sep 2014], a tragedy likely to damage trust in health services in opposition-held areas.

The manufacturer, who has not been identified, shipped the vaccine in powder form with a diluent to a hub in Syria where it was stored and then sent to Deir al-Zor and Idlib provinces for the campaign to vaccinate tens of thousands of children that began Monday [15 Sep 2014], WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier said.

"In the hub apparently, (from) what we know so far, the diluent was kept ... together in the same refrigerator with a muscle relaxant. The relaxant is called Atracurium. This got mixed in some cases instead of the diluent with the vaccine powder," Lindmeier told a news briefing in Geneva.

Pointing to human error, he said: "So the ones who packed it obviously put the wrong ampoules with the vaccine powder into the package. Then it gets shipped in the vaccine carriers to the facility, there it gets unpacked, mixed and then it has to be used within 6 hours. So both at the packing and at the unpacking, there had to be gross negligence," Lindmeier said.

The muscle relaxant, usually administered as an anesthetic for surgery, works according to weight, so all the children who died were under the age of 2 [years], he said. Older children survived after vomiting, diarrhea and anaphylactic shock.

Lindmeier said: "It seems very clear that it was not the manufacturer's fault, not that the vaccine is contaminated, but it's a fault on the ground, again not established whether it's human error or deliberate, but the fault lies on the ground as per indications."

It was not clear who was in charge of the refrigerator, and investigations continue, he said. The WHO and UNICEF supported the campaign but were not directly involved due to insecurity and the "politically-charged" situation in the area, he added.

"There is still a slight possibility that it's not only human error, but an intent; that has to be cleared up definitely before anything can continue," he said.

More than 50 000 children in the 2 provinces received the vaccine before the campaign was suspended, he added.

Prior to Syria's civil war, some 99 percent of children were vaccinated against measles, a highly contagious disease that can cause serious complications such as meningitis and pneumonia, becoming much deadlier in difficult conditions.

[Additional information in the above media report is the identification of the error occurring in the distribution hub, where atracurium was shipped together with the measles vaccine as a diluent to reconstitute the lyophilized vaccine (freeze dried vaccine that is stored as a powder that requires mixing with a liquid solution known as diluent prior to administration).

According to the description of the media reports previously posted (Vaccine adverse event - Syria (ID, DY): muscle relaxant, fatalities 20140918.2784470), the vials containing the atracurium resembled the vials of diluent normally used to reconstitute the vaccine. It is unfortunate that the labels of the atracurium vials were apparently not read prior to their use. There have been isolated reports through the years of problems associated with vaccines when incorrect or contaminated diluent was used to reconstitute the vaccine, but these reports occurred associated with single vials of vaccine and not multiple vials. One hopes the results of the investigation will not identify intentionality in this event.
