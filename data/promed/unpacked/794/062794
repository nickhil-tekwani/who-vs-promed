Cold weather fails to halt rust infection
-----------------------------------------
Rust infections are starting to appear in winter wheat crops in some
areas, growers are being advised. Despite the cold winter -- which
was thought may have killed off infections -- early reports of yellow
rust are starting to emerge from several parts of the country.

So far, these include Lincolnshire and various parts of the Midlands,
but others may be affected, says Syngenta disease specialist Rod
Burke. "Although we don't yet know how these early infections will
develop, it's important growers factor them into their early season
disease control."

Plant pathologist Bill Clark, director of Broom's Barn research
centre, has also picked up early rust reports. Although it can be
difficult distinguishing between yellow and brown rust at this time
of the season disease is certainly present, so it's not alarmist to
consider rust along with septoria at the April spray timing, he says.

In the Midlands, agronomist Chris Page has found yellow rust on the
variety Robigus in Northamptonshire. "It's not surprising given the
conditions and the variety. Although it's been very cold and dry, the
recent milder weather has helped the disease develop. Moisture from
overnight dews or rain will continue to provide optimum conditions
for development."

On backward crops, growers will need to be extra vigilant with crop
inspections.

[Stripe rust, also called yellow rust, of cereals is caused by the
fungus _Puccinia striiformis_ var. _striiformis_. It causes yellow
leaf stripes and stunting of plants with yield losses of 40 to 100
percent. It affects wheat, some barley varieties, triticale, and a
number of wild grasses. Spores are wind dispersed in several cycles
during the cropping season. Grasses and volunteer crop plants may
generate a "green bridge" providing inoculum for the next crop cycle.
Disease monitoring is important so timely action can be taken to
limit the spread of the pathogen as well as build-up of inoculum.
Disease management includes the use of resistant varieties, fungicide
applications, and control of volunteer crops.

New pathogen strains with increased virulence have been reported in
recent years from wheat growing areas in Europe, North America,
Australia, India and are also suspected to emerge in China. National
and collaborative resistance breeding programmes have been set up in response.

The other wheat diseases mentioned above are leaf rust, also called
brown rust, caused by the fungus _Puccinia recondita_; and the
septoria complex caused by the fungi _Mycosphaerella graminicola_
(previously _Septoria tritici_) and _Phaeosphaeria nodorum_. These
pathogens also affect photosynthetic ability of the host and cause
yield losses. (For more information see previous ProMED-mail posts in
