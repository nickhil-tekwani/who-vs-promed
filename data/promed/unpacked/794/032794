Influenza update 136 [17 Jun 2011]
----------------------------------
Summary
-------
- The influenza season has finished in the temperate countries of the
northern hemisphere with only sporadic influenza virus detections
occurring.
- Transmission in tropical areas remains low with localized
circulation noted in the western and eastern regions of sub-Saharan
Africa and low level circulation in some countries of northern South
America.
- South Africa has reported a sharp increase in influenza-like
illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) rates,
primarily influenza A(H1N1)2009.
- Influenza activity remains low in other temperate countries of the
southern hemisphere.

The influenza season has ended in the northern hemisphere. Although
sporadic detections of influenza viruses have been reported in many
countries across the northern temperate zone, no active community
transmission has been noted. Consultation rates for influenza-like
illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) are at low
levels and continue to decline in both the European and North American
regions. In North Africa influenza circulation remains low although
Egypt has reported 5 recent infections of the avian influenza A(H5N1)
virus with 3 deaths since May [2011].

Countries in the tropical zone
------------------------------
Influenza activity in tropical areas remains low with localized
transmission reported in some regions. Very low influenza activity was
reported across central and tropical South America. Low level
circulation of influenza type B and influenza A(H3N2) has been noted
in Brazil. Colombia and the Plurinational State of Bolivia have
reported a slight increase in influenza virus detection with low level
circulation of influenza A(H1N1)2009 in Colombia and A(H3N2) in the
Plurinational State of Bolivia. Colombia has also reported an
increased proportion of intensive care unit admission of SARI cases of
which children under the age of 5 contributed the highest proportion.
Notably, respiratory syncytial virus has been widely circulating in
Colombia in recent weeks.

Localized transmission has been noted across 4 countries in West
Africa with Ghana and Togo reporting the largest numbers of
laboratory-confirmed cases. In Ghana, the majority of the reported
cases were influenza A(H1N1)2009 with a smaller proportion of
influenza type B and even lower proportion of influenza A(H3N2). Togo
has reported transmission primarily with influenza type B. 2 other
West African countries, Nigeria and Cameroon, both reported detection
of influenza type B in modest numbers. In East Africa, Kenya has
reported co-circulation of A(H1N1)2009 and influenza type B while
Rwanda has reported transmission of A(H3N2).

Tropical Asian regions have also reported low influenza activity.
Thailand, the Lao People's Democratic Republic and the Philippines
have not detected any influenza virus since the last update. Influenza
type B is the most common virus detected in the southern region of
China, India, and Cambodia, though in very low numbers, while
influenza A(H1N1)2009 is more common in Viet Nam with 10 per cent of
ILI cases testing positive.

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
South America

South American countries in the temperate region reported low numbers
of influenza viruses with ILI consultation rates similar to those
reported in the previous few weeks. Sporadic detection of influenza
A(H1N1)2009 virus has been reported in Uruguay and Chile.

Southern Africa

A sharp increase in ILI consultation rate has been noted by The
National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa.
Influenza A(H1N1)2009 virus was the most common virus detected in the
ILI cases. The numbers of SARI cases admitted to hospital have also
increased and are also associated primarily with influenza
A(H1N1)2009. Influenza surveillance from Madagascar had a modest
increase in detections of influenza viruses. The proportion of
influenza A(H3N2) has decreased there while the proportion of
influenza type B seems to remain stable.

Australia and New Zealand and South Pacific

The influenza season does not appear to have started in either
Australia or New Zealand. Australia reported stable ILI consultation
rates below levels in 2008 and 2010 during the same period. The New
South Wales Department of Health has also indicated that the rate of
death associated with influenza and pneumonia remains below the
seasonal threshold for this period. New Zealand reported the national
ILI consultation rate below baseline activity. However, regional
differences are noted where the baseline level is exceeded by one
District Health Board from Northland. Influenza type B is the most
common virus detected recently in New Zealand, though the numbers are
quite small.

Source of data
--------------
The Global Influenza Programme monitors influenza activity worldwide
and publishes an update every 2 weeks. The updates are based on
available epidemiological and virological data sources, including
FluNet (reported by the Global Influenza Surveillance Network) and
influenza reports from WHO Regional Offices and Member States.
Completeness can vary among updates due to availability and quality of
data available at the time when the update is developed.

[The most notable feature of the current global situation is the
delayed appearance of the southern hemisphere winter influenza
epidemic. In contrast, in parts of South America (notably Colombia and
Chile) cases of respiratory syncytial virus infection in children have
occurred earlier and in greater number than usually observed. Probably
as a consequence there has been an increased proportion of intensive
care unit admissions of SARI cases of children under the age of 5. -
