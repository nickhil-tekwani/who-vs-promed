The recent epidemic of enterovirus infections in Cambodia was responsible for dozens of deaths of young children. Human enterovirus 71 genotype C4 was identified as the principal etiologic agent (ProMED-mail: Human enterovirus 71 - Cambodia: genotype C4 archive number 20120726.1216290).

We randomly selected 4 EV71 strains isolated between 15 Jun and 30 Jul 2012 from patients presenting with fatal encephalitis associated with pulmonary edema and hospitalized at the Kantha Bopha Hospital in Phnom Penh. All 4 patients originated from different Cambodian provinces. The 4 EV71 strains were amplified in cell culture and fully sequenced using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) on Roche 454 Flex and/or by Sanger method by a joint international team led by Institut Pasteur in Cambodia (Philippe Buchy) with collaborators from Institut Pasteur of Shanghai, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IPS-CAS; Ralf Altmeyer), and the State Key Laboratory for Emerging Infectious Diseases at Hong Kong University (Guan Yi and Maria Zhu Huachen). The 4 full genome sequences were aligned with sequences available in GenBank or unpublished sequences from recently circulating Chinese strains communicated by IPS-CAS and Children's Hospital of Fudan University (Mei Zeng). The phylogenetic analysis demonstrated close relationship with strains circulating in China between 2009 and 2011. Of note, recent full genome sequences from Vietnamese isolates are not yet publicly available and were thus not included in the analysis. Additional bioinformatic analysis did not show evidence of recombination in the genome of the 4 isolates.

In addition, we sequenced approximately 840 base pairs of the VP1 gene (positions 2268 to 3109) of 13 EV71 strains and 3 non-EV71 enteroviruses isolated from patients with mild or severe symptoms of infection and hospitalized between 15 Jun and 22 Jul 2012. These strains were selected randomly from children originating from various Cambodian provinces. All the EV71 virus sequences clustered together within the C4 subgenotype group (or D subgenotype according to the classification suggested by Chan YF et al., Infect Genet Evol 2010; 10(3): 404-412) with a percentage of homology at nucleotide level varying from 98.4 to 100 percent, and were closely related to strains isolated in 2011 in Viet Nam (homology at the nucleotide level: 98.4-100 percent, sequences kindly provided by Thanh Tran Tan, Jeremy Farrar and Rogier van Doorn; Oxford University Clinical Research Unit, Ho Chi Minh city, Viet Nam), confirming previous preliminary data. The other 3 viruses analyzed belonged to one other human enterovirus species, one echovirus, and one coxsackievirus species. Some coxsackie A6 viruses were also detected directly from clinical specimens using specific PCR.

These data confirm our preliminary findings showing that EV71 genotype C4 is at the origin of most hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) severe cases associated with encephalitis and edema in Cambodian children. Besides EV71, various other enteroviruses were also detected, mainly in non-severe cases. The full genome sequences generated as of today do not suggest any recombination event in the strains analyzed and obtained from patients deceased from severe encephalitis.

[ProMED-mail welcomes the opportunity to post the outcome of these studies of enterovirus 71 isolates obtained during the recent/current outbreaks of hand, foot and mouth disease affecting children in several Southeast Asian countries.

The data confirm that the C4 genotype of enterovirus 71 is the predominate enterovirus associated with these outbreaks. The whole genome sequences are closely related and show no evidence of genetic recombination or other genome rearrangements that might be indicative of enhanced virulence.

Readers interested in obtaining an understanding of "next generation" sequencing should consult the review: "Application of next generation sequencing technologies in virology, by A.D. Radford et al., in the current issue of the Journal of General Virology 93, 1853-1868 (2012), open access article, http://vir.sgmjournals.org/content/93/Pt_9/1853.full.pdf+html." - Mod.CP
