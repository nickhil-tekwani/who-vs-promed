The 1st cases [see commentary] of infection with African swine fever (ASF) virus were found in 4 wild boars in the Dobrich region (northeastern Bulgaria). The boars were shot at a hunting farm on the land of the village of Bulgarevo, the Bulgarian Food Safety Agency (BFSA) announced on 1 Nov 2018, reports Bulgarian National Television.

By an order of the BFSA Executive Director, Dr. Damyan Iliev, measures have been imposed to prevent and limit the spread of the infection in accordance with the existing legislation. Areas of restriction have been created, and oversight of wild and domestic swine has been enhanced.

The BFSA will conduct ongoing ASF clinical examinations in domestic swine and will take samples from all dead wild boars and domestic pigs, as well as from any showing signs of the disease. The samples will be taken in line with the implementation of the Disease Prevention and Control Programme in Bulgaria. Measures for domestic pigs are taken to prevent transfer of the virus between wild and domestic animals.

At a meeting of the Regional Epizootic Commission in Dobrich today [2 Nov 2018], the participants discussed the control measures and their implementation. Farm biosecurity is a key factor in protecting domestic pigs from getting infected with the ASF virus. Therefore, the BFSA reminds all that pigs in "backyard farms" should be kept in enclosures with enhanced biosecurity and should not have contact with wild pigs.

[Bulgaria has submitted on Tue 23 Oct 2018 an official immediate notification to the OIE about its 1st ASF-infected wild boar. The animal was found dead 4 meters [about 13 feet] from the fence erected by Bulgaria on its border with Romania, namely in the village Kanairdzha, Silistra oblast [region]. The immediate notification, with a map, is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=28379.

On 26 Oct 2018 Bulgaria submitted a follow-up report informing about a 2nd infected wild boar, killed in a forest in the same village. Kanairdzha is located on the southern bank of the lower Danube River, about 22 km [approximately 23 miles] southeast of the Bulgarian port city of Silistra (map at https://tinyurl.com/ycmqaew7). From Silistra westward, the Danube River divides the 2 countries, forming a natural boundary between Romania and Bulgaria; Silistra is at the western end of the fence planned to stretch from the Black Sea coast in northeast Bulgaria.

The current event, involving 4 killed wild boars, is situated on the land of the village Bulgarevo, nearly 110 km [about 68 miles] southeast of Kanairdzha and about 37 km [23 miles] south of the Romanian border; see map at https://tinyurl.com/yad9qfxz.

This seems to be a locally acquired infection and not a new introduction of infected boars from Romania. Intensified surveillance and enhanced biosecurity measures on pig farms, throughout Bulgaria, are warranted. - Mod.AS
