Measles is a highly contagious viral disease for which no treatment exists. The only way to fight it is vaccination and treatment of the symptoms in the hope that the patient will be strong enough to naturally fight off the infection.

The measles epidemic declared in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) on 10 Jun 2019 is the deadliest the country has experienced since 2011-2012. Between January and early August 2019, over 145 000 people have been infected, and 2758 have died. Since July 2019 the epidemic has worsened, with a rise in new cases reported in several provinces.

Only USD 2.5 million has been raised out of the USD 8.9 million required for the Health Cluster response plan, in stark contrast with the Ebola epidemic in the east of the country, which attracts multiple organisations and hundreds of millions of dollars in funding.

Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) has been fighting the outbreak alongside local Ministry of Health teams through regular projects and emergency interventions reaching a total of 13 provinces around the country.

Since the beginning of the year [2019], MSF has vaccinated 474 860 children between 6 months and 5 years old and provided medical care to 27 440 patients.

Most recently, we have been sending teams to new areas such as the province of Mai-Ndombe, in the west of the country, where an emergency team is working to limit the spread of the epidemic in the health zones of Kwamouth, Bolobo and Nioki along the Kasai river. Set up to be mobile and agile, the team moves its base continuously, enabling them to adapt to the needs identified on the ground and reach people in remote areas where access to healthcare remains extremely challenging.

"Just getting vaccines to places where children need them is a huge task. They need to be kept within strict temperature limits, which means setting up a 'cold chain'. This requires refrigerators, generators, fuel and fast transportation, as well as a maintenance system. Many health zones do not receive any support from other organisations, despite evident needs," explained Pierre Van Heddegem, field coordinator of MSF's measles emergency team.

Unless there is a massive mobilisation of funds and response organisations, this outbreak could get even worse.

"Two months after the official declaration and few weeks before the start of the school year, the measles epidemic shows no signs of slowing down. In fact, since July 2019, the epidemic has worsened, with a rise in new cases reported in several provinces," Karel explained.

[If one compares the case numbers and deaths from measles to Ebola in the DRC this year [2019], measles dwarfs Ebola; yet the support and funding for Ebola dwarfs measles. This is most likely because Ebola is much more in the international public eye. Between January and early August 2019, over 145 000 people have been infected with measles, and 2758 have died in the DRC as compared with Ebola, 2861 cases, with 1921 deaths. This is in spite of the number of children between 6 months and 5 years old who have been vaccinated with MMR vaccine, 474 860, compared with approximately 160 000 individuals vaccinated against Ebola.

USD 2.5 million has been raised out of the USD 8.9 million required to control measles, compared with hundreds of millions of dollars to fight Ebola.

To address the problem of maintenance of a cold chain during transportation to remote areas, vaccines could be delivered by drones and integrated into the existing health system. This has been done to bring vaccines to the "hard-to-reach Congolese village, Widjifake."

The number of measles cases in Malta has soared to an unprecedented level this year [2019], with 30 cases reported in the 1st 6 months, according to the World Health Organisation.

Data recently published by the health body showed that the figures until June 2019 are in stark contrast to those for the previous years. According to the WHO data, between 2011 and 2018, there were only 11 cases reported. There were no cases reported in a number of these years, and, between 2012 and 2017, there were only 2 cases reported, one in 2013 and another 2 years later.

Earlier this year [2019], the WHO had flagged the issue [slipping vaccine rates] with a rapid increase in measles cases on a global level. At the time, preliminary figures had shown that measles cases rose 300% worldwide through the 1st 3 months of 2019 when compared to the same period last year [2018].

According to the Superintendent of Public Health, Charmaine Gauci, after a number of years with no cases of the disease, in 2018, there were 5 imported cases and one local transmission.

Most of the cases occurred in adults who were not vaccinated. "This year [2019], we have already seen over 15 locally acquired cases. Most of the cases occurred in adults who were not vaccinated," Dr Gauci said when the preliminary figures came out.

In its report on this year's [2019] data, the WHO noted a "dramatic resurgence of measles compared to previous years" in the European region, with 49 of the 53 countries in the region together having reported over 160 000 measles cases and over 100 measles-related deaths by the end of May 2019.

"High national-level coverage can mask pockets of low coverage at the local level, resulting in an accumulation of susceptible individuals that often goes unrecognised until outbreaks occur. An enhanced response is needed to protect all populations in the region from this dangerous disease," WHO said. It has set the ambitious goal of achieving measles and rubella elimination in at least 5 of its regions by 2020.

Director of the Department of Health of Kyiv Valentyna Hinzburh has said that an outbreak of measles in Kyiv has become the largest since the independence of Ukraine.

According to her, over 5000 people fell ill with measles in Kyiv in 6 months of 2019, of which almost 3000 were adults. This is 3 times the figure recorded in the same period of 2018. About 50% of patients required hospitalization due to the severe course of the disease. This year [2019], 2 adults died from measles, as they were not vaccinated and reported to the doctor too late.

Ukraine is among the countries that have reported the highest numbers of measles cases in 2019.

"Today, nothing but vaccines will protect Kyiv from outbreaks and epidemics of vaccine-preventable infectious diseases," Hinzburh said. She said the current situation in the capital and Ukraine as a whole was a result of reduced collective immunity. "Here are just a few figures that are staggering. In 2015, 5 people got measles in Kyiv, 3 in 2016, 87 in 2017, 3045 in 2018, and over 5000 for 6 months in 2019!" she said.

The New York State Department of Health, working closely with the Wyoming County [NY] Health Department, has confirmed 5 cases of measles within a local Mennonite community.

The state and county health departments are working to determine whether there were additional exposures and to advise people who may have experienced symptoms consistent with measles to contact the Wyoming County Department of Health or their health care provider.

Wyoming County health officials are actively engaging the Mennonite community to discuss the importance of getting vaccinated to prevent the spread of measles. Additionally, the state Department of Health has issued a health advisory to regional health care providers to notify them of the cases and potential for exposure. Health care providers should report all suspected cases of measles to their local health department. Contact the Wyoming County Department of Health for more information.

In New York State, measles immunization is required of children enrolled in schools, daycare, and pre-kindergarten. Since August 1990, college students have also been required to demonstrate immunity against measles.

A new requirement Governor Andrew M. Cuomo signed into law in June 2019 ended all non-medical exemptions for vaccines required for children to attend all public, private and parochial schools, as well as childcare programs.

The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) yesterday [17 Aug 2019] confirmed 5 new measles cases associated with a cluster outbreak in Taipei, saying that 1981 people who had come into direct contact with the patients would be monitored for symptoms until 6 Sep 2019.

The cases are likely associated with a man in his 30s living in northern Taiwan who was infected with measles in Viet Nam, returned home on 29 Jul 2019, transmitted the disease to his flat-mate, and was confirmed to have measles on Wed 31 Jul 2019, the centers said.

One of the 5 cases confirmed yesterday [17 Aug 2019] is a man in his 30s who was on the same flight with the index case on 29 Jul 2019 and was in Viet Nam from 5 Aug to Wed 14 Aug 2019, so he might have been infected by the index case or by other people in Viet Nam, it added.

The other 4 patients are nurses who work at Cathay General Hospital's emergency room who had come into contact with the index case, the CDC said.

The nurses started experiencing symptoms between Friday last week [9 Aug 2019?] and Thursday this week [15 Aug 2019?], CDC Deputy Director-General Chuang Jen-hsiang said, adding that one of them was vaccinated for measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) in 2013, and 2 were vaccinated last year [2018], but the other has not been vaccinated.

The hospital held an emergency response meeting to discuss prevention measures and asked the medical practitioners who have had direct contact with the index case to have their measles antibody levels measured and receive an MMR vaccine if no antibodies are found, hospital deputy superintendent Lee Chia-long said. The hospital also asked medical practitioners with higher antibody levels to help screen patients with a fever, control the personnel who are allowed to enter the emergency room, take disinfection measures, and put up posters to warn people about clustered measles cases, he said.

One 119 measles cases have been confirmed this year [2019] -- 72 domestic cases, among whom 51 had come into contact with confirmed cases, and 47 imported -- the CDC said.
