Foot-and-mouth disease hits North Viet Nam
-----------------------------------------------
Viet Nam's northern provinces of Thai Nguyen and Quang Ninh have been
stricken by foot-and-mouth disease [FMD], according to a local
veterinary agency on Wednesday [25 Apr 2007].
The disease has hit Dai Tu district in Thai Nguyen since 12 Apr 2007,
affecting 6 bulls and buffaloes and 14 pigs, and also the 2 districts
of Ba Che and Tien Yen in Quang Ninh since 5 Apr 2007, affecting 27
bulls and buffaloes and 14 pigs, said the Department of Animal Health
under the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.
The provincial Veterinary Bureaus have culled all infected cattle,
and [disinfected] affected farms.
Now, the disease is hitting 12 communes in 5 provinces, namely, Thai
Nguyen and Quang Ninh in the north, and Phu Yen, Gia Lai and Ha Tinh
in the central region, said the department.
Under a national agriculture development plan approved by the
government in 2005, Viet Nam will, by 2010, have 35-40 million pigs,
6.5-6.7 million bulls and cows and 2.8-3 million buffaloes.

[According to a posting dated 4 Feb 2007 (archive 20070204.0448), 11
Vietnamese provinces were reportedly affected at that time, namely
Cao Bang, Tuyen Quang, Lang Son, Yen Bai, Thai Nguyen, Phu Tho
provinces in the north; Can Tho City, HCMC, Soc Trang, Dong Nai in
the south; and Kon Tum province in the central highlands. On 23 Feb
2007, 2 provinces, Quang Binh and Quang Nam were allegedly added to
the list (see 20070223.0671); clarification was requested.
In the current newswire, Quang Ninh is added, while Thai Nguyen is
mentioned as still (or newly?) infected. For an administrative map,

According to OIE's main web-site, Viet Nam's last reports on its
prevailing FMD situation were submitted on 20 and 24 May 2006; see
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_17.HTM#Sec7>.
Additional, more current information from Viet Nam is available at
the web-site of the OIE Southeast Asia Regional FMD Coordination Unit
(SEAFMD)
<http://www.seafmd-rcu.oie.int/index.php>.
The most recent (December 2006) Vietnamese FMD data are presented in
a table and a map. The map shows 8 Vietnamese provinces as infected
by FMD virus serotype O in December 2006; see
<http://www.seafmd-rcu.oie.int/fmd_se_asia.php?reptype=map&state=VNM&month=12&year=2006>.
An official update to OIE's WAHID interface will be helpful in
clarifying the actual current FMD situation. - Mod.AS]
