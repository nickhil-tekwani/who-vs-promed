The message that ministers Verburg (LNV) and Klink (VWS) had decided
to refrain from culling goats in children's petting farms and
educational institutions [see posting 20100107.0079 ] has prompted
many questions. Why are all pregnant animals on infected large dairy
farms culled, while those in small holdings and children's farms are
not? Is this not a double standard? The answer is: It seems so, but
there are good reasons for the distinction.

All control measures are considered from a public health point of
view. During 2009, 2300 people became ill in the Netherlands from the
Q fever bacterium. Therefore, everything is now focused on the aim to
reduce this number as far as possible over the coming years.

Culling in infected, large-scale holdings
-----------------------------------
The greatest risk to public health is posed by large groups of
pregnant dairy goats and sheep, which excrete very large quantities of
the Q fever bacteria during normal birthing or abortions. This was
indicated in the advice received from the expert group led by Roel
Coutinho of RIVM (the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and
Environment). If an infected goat gives birth to a live lamb, millions
of Q-fever bacteria are released; in case of an abortion, their
numbers go into the billions.

In large farms, most matings are managed to take place within a short
period, or mating is synchronised, leading to the birth of many
animals taking place during comparatively short periods, many on the
same days. Similarly, abortions, if occurring, may involve many
animals, sometimes taking the form of abortion "storms." In case those
animals are infected by Q fever, this means the excretion of very
large quantities of bacteria by many animals simultaneously: This is
the greatest threat to public health. Consequently, the presence of
infected pregnant animals on the farm should be prevented ahead of the
lambing season (which usually starts in January). Since individual
testing of animals in the short term is not possible, all pregnant
animals on infected farms should be culled. [Subscribers are also
referred to the research paper cited in the commentary to posting
20100107.0079. The authors indicated, among other things, that "the
study showed that a non-negligible [i.e. epidemiologically significant
- Mod.JW] proportion of seronegative animals that delivered normally
could excrete _C. burnetii_." - Mod.AS]

Saving animals on children's farms
---------------------------------
Q fever may infect sheep and goats also on petting farms, small
holders' yards or occupational therapeutic farms ("businesses with a
public function".) The difference between these farms and large
milk-producing goat or sheep farms is the number of animals crowded
together and birthing (or aborting) simultaneously. In small-scale
farms, there are fewer animals in a state of Q fever bacteria
secretion. Therefore, these holdings pose a lower risk to human
health, and the pregnant animals on these farms are not culled.

Research shows that, so far, the Q fever bacterium has hardly ever
been found in children's farms. Yet, visitors to petting farms where Q
fever-infected sheep or goats are kept may always be exposed to some
risk of getting infected.

The RIVM-led expert group was asked to provide advice pertaining to
the said risk on petting farms or other small-scale holdings with less
than 50 animals. According to experts, it is generally not necessary
to take additional measures concerning such holdings.

However, it was recommended to pay special attention to hygiene on
children's farms. In addition, children's ("petting") farms and
occupational therapeutic farms are advised to let the birthing take
place in separate pens without pubic access. This will prevent contact
between infected birthing or aborting animals and visitors, and the
excretion of bacteria close to visitors, and further diminish the risk
of infection.

Furthermore, it has been decided that petting and therapeutic farms
will be vaccinated with priority. Fortunately, there is vaccine enough
available for all such establishments.

Adults and children visiting petting farms are advised to pay
attention to hygiene. Appropriate advisory information is available on
the website of the VWA (Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority).

[Additional explanation on the significant weight of the large dairy
goat farms in the large-scale dissemination of _C. burnetii_ can be
found in the advisory letter to Ministers sent by Prof Coutinho on 17
Jul 2009. It provided several examples demonstrating the temporal and
spatial association between large, infected dairy goat farms and human
infection. The 1st example (2007) came from Herpen village, where many
human infections were recorded around a goat farm with an abortion
storm. A significant case was that of Helmond town in 2008: the
percentage of infected humans increased in proportion to the proximity
of their dwellings to a large dairy goat establishment. Similar
findings of measurable connections were recorded in South Limburg.

A map showing all commercial dairy goat/sheep flocks regarded infected
as of 8 Jan 2010, indicating the 5-km zone around each, is available
at
<http://www.rivm.nl/cib/binaries/gebiedskaart_100108_tcm92-65083.pdf>.

A map showing municipalities with notified Q fever patients (per 100
000), 1 Jan-22 Dec 2009, as well as the locations of infected
commercial dairy goat farms, is available at
<http://www.rivm.nl/cib/binaries/Q-koorts%20incidentie_tcm92-60500.pdf>.

A 62nd infected farm has been officially added to the list on 9 Jan
2010, located in Een West in Drente province. The holding includes 450
goats, 249 of them pregnant; those are to be culled on 11 Jan 2010
(today).

The Dutch delegation is expected to present an updating report on the
Q fever situation during the next meeting of the EU's Standing
Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health (SCFCAH), due in
Brussels on Tue 12 Jan 2010. The last report on the issue (dated 6 Oct
2009) was presented during the 3 Nov 2009 meeting (available at
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations/0304112009_q_fever_nl.pdf>).
