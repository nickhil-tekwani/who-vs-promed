[The numbers of Lassa fever cases continued to increase gradually throughout 2017. This is not surprising. As noted in earlier comments, Lassa fever remains a problem in Nigeria because the virus is endemic there. Virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or their excreta. Transmission also occurs in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed and barrier-nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients.

Images of mastomys mice, the rodent reservoir of Lassa fever virus, can be seen at https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/45326-Mastomys-natalensis.

[2] Mortality, 2 physicians
Date: Sun 14 Jan 2018
Source: Daily Post [edited]
http://dailypost.ng/2018/01/14/panic-ebonyi-lassa-fever-kills-2-resident-doctors/


In the Federal Teaching Hospital, Abakiliki, FETHA, Ebonyi State, 2 resident doctors serving have died of Lassa fever. They both died on Sunday [14 Jan 2018], throwing other health workers in the hospital into panic.

This is also as [another] 2 house officers, who joined in treating the contact patient, as well as nurses, are on watch list.

The deceased include a Resident Doctor in the Department of Otorhinolayngology, FETHA, and another Resident Doctor in the Department of Community Medicine, of the same hospital.

The death was confirmed in a terse statement by the National Association of Resident Doctors, NARD, which was obtained by Daily Post.

The statement was signed by NARD secretary, Dr. O.V Nnadi. It read: "The President of NARD Dr Ugochukwu Chinaka and the whole NARD NEC commiserate with the President and congressmen of ARD.FETHA on the sudden loss of another of our colleagues, a Resident Doctor in the Department of Otorhinolayngology, FETHA, and a Resident Doctor in the Department of Community Medicine, FETHA.

On the part of the otorhinolayngology resident, the statement said: "He died about 4 hours ago after a tonsillectomy on a Lassa fever patient. The House Officer and the nurse that joined him in the surgery are presently on their way to Irrua Specialist Hospital, Irrua."

A, the NARD spokesman said, "died in the early hours of this morning at Irrua Specialist Hospital, Irrua where he was being managed for complications from Lassa fever.

When Daily Post contacted the NARD National President, Dr. Chinaka Ugochukwu, he confirmed the deaths. "Yes, there are reports to that effect," he said.

[Apparently, the otorhinolayngology resident, and probably the community medicine resident as well, were unaware that the patients who they were attending were infected with Lassa fever virus and were not using personal protective equipment (PPE). This raises the important question about when PPE should be used. Ebonyi state is endemic for Lassa fever virus, and there have been cases there this year (2017). However, early in the course of Lassa fever virus infection, patients may present with fever and other general symptoms common to many infections, yet be viremic. Using PPE for all febrile patients may not be practical, but might have spared the lives of these 2 young physicians. - Mod.TY
