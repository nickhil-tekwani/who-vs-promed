Classical swine fever [CSF] - Lithuania (Penevezhsky okrug)
-----------------------------------------------------------
Lithuania's State Food and Veterinary Service says that an outbreak of
classical swine fever has been reported from the quarantine farm
Pasodil belonging to the Danish company Saerimner.

According to Mindaugasa Kashinskasa, the representative of the
Service, 445 pigs, previously imported from Denmark, have been
destroyed. Disinfection has been carried out on the farm, informed
Lithuanian Delfi [news].

In addition, workers conducted laboratory tests on all the nearby farms.

To determine whether there was local spread of CSF, the Service
continues to inspect farms and pig-breeding complexes. Samples are
being collected from domestic pigs and wild boar in the vicinity for
further study.

Information about this case was transferred to the EU and to
neighboring countries.

[According to the OIE-derived data on the CSF situation of Lithuania,
the disease has not been recorded there since 1992 ("last year of
occurrence"). The last occurrence of CSF in Denmark was in 1933.

The information above, seemingly related to a consignment of animals
kept in a quarantine facility (or a farm recognised as a post-import
quarantine facility?) is in need of clarification. This should include
the details of the laboratory tests performed.

The county of Panevezio (in Russian, Penevezhsky okrug), one of
Lithuania's 10 main administrative regions, is situated in the
northeast. See maps at
