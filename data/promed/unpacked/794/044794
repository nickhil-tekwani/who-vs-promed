'Paddy blast' hits Kashmir paddy crop
-------------------------------------
As the reaping season of paddy is reaching its zenith farmers in many
parts of the valley are worried. They say that the crop has been hit
by a disease known as paddy blast. Officials of the agriculture
department say that the fungal disease is seen in parts of Kulgam,
Pulwama, and Kupwara. Officials say that the disease has affected the
overall produce. "The production of rice is expected to be low as
compared to previous years," Showkat Beigh, technical officer to the
director of agriculture said. "Crops on more than 1000 hectares (2471
acres) of land are infected and the production loss is expected to be
about 10 percent," Beigh said. "The blast fungus needs high
temperature and moisture to propagate and this summer [2008] climate
remained favorable for its growth," a senior official of the
agriculture department said.

Agricultural scientists at Sher-i-Kashmir University of Agricultural
Science and Technology (SKUAST) have carried out a field survey of
the affected areas and have established the reasons as climatic as
well as negligence of farmers. Director of SKUAST Dr A R Trag blamed
farmers for the loss they are suffering due to the blast fungus.
"Only 10 percent of farmers go by our recommendations and use seeds
provided by our University," Dr Trag said.

Scientists at SKUAST employ various scientific methods to improve
disease resistance and net yield of rice varieties in order to stop
the recurrence of this disease. "We treat seeds in laboratories and
make them available to farmers. Besides we advise farmers to use
certain sprays after consultation with experts," Dr Trag stressed.

[Rice blast is caused by the fungus _Magnaporthe grisea_. It is one
of the most destructive diseases of rice worldwide, often killing the
host. Yield losses of more than 50 percent are reported in infected
fields. Symptom severity and spread of the blast fungus are
influenced by climatic conditions. More than 50 species of grasses
and sedges can be affected, but most strains isolated from rice can
only infect a limited number of cultivars. The disease is spread by
infected plant debris, mechanical means, water, and wind. Disease
management may include fungicides and cultural practices, but relies
mainly on resistant varieties. The fungus is highly variable,
however, and new strains are emerging, breaking down host resistance.
