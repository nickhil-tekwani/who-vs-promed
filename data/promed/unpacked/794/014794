Trichinellosis from pork, Cordoba, Argentina
--------------------------------------------

The Ministry of Health in Cordoba, Argentina, through its Epidemiology
Section, reported the occurrence of a new trichinosis outbreak, and it
warned citizens about the risks of purchasing or eating pork from the
grey market or without its proper sanitary authorization.

The outbreak occurred in Tancacha community, and five persons affected
with the disease have been identified, four of them are relatives. One
of the patients was cared for in Rawson Hospital in Cordoba city, and
the others were seen in a private health facility in Tancacha.

The source of the infection has not yet been identified but it is thought
that it may be due to the use of food from certain places in the
community.

The investigation and appropriate controls are currently being carried
out by the Tancacha Municipality and the Epidemiology Section of the
Ministry of Health, with the participation of the Control Sub
secretariat in the Ministry of Agriculture, Farming and Food, and the
National Service for Alimentary Safety (SENASA, according to its
Spanish initials).

[There has been several reports of Trichinellosis from Argentina over the past seven years (see below). The main problem is probably feeding of pigs with household waste and marketing of products without the mandatory veterinary control of the meat. - Mod. EP
