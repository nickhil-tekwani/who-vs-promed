Local physicians in the La Asunta municipality confirmed yesterday [Wed 10 Oct 2018] 9 positive hantavirus infections and declared a health emergency in the communities of this population, located in the Yungas in the La Paz department. "A total of 9 hantavirus [infection] positive cases have been confirmed as well as one death," Carlos Tintaya, the La Asunta municipal hospital physician, said to Page 7.

He indicated that 17 members of the Fuerza de Tarea Conjunta (FTC) [military joint taskforce] were evacuated this past weekend, "9 were positive according to laboratory tests. With one death, there are 10 cases," he emphasized. Of the 9 hantavirus [infected] soldiers, according to Tintaya, one is in intensive care and the other 8 are recovering in a hospital in Santa Cruz.

According to the physician, a team of professionals were sent to 2 camps in the Puerto Aroma and Inchura sector to examine the soldiers. "We took samples from 3 of them because they had pain in the abdomen, muscles and joints, and send them yesterday [Tue 9 Oct 2018] to Santa Cruz," he said.

The physician added that the 3 samples were sent as a preventive measure. He stated that during the inspection of the camps of those affected, they did not find remnants of rodent feces or urine; "We have not found anything that caught our attention," he stated. He added that a brigade from SEDES [Servicio Departamental de Salud; Health Services Department] will arrive to both localities in order to take further samples.

The La Paz SEDES stated via an information release that today [Thu 11 Oct 2018] they will release a report about the hantavirus cases in La Asunta.

Hantavirus [infection can result in] a disease that humans contract when they breathe in places contaminated by urine, excrement and saliva of [infected] rodents.

[Hantavirus infections have occurred previously in various parts of Bolivia, including in tropical areas of La Paz department. Occurrence of hantavirus infections in soldiers in military camps in Bolivia is not surprising. As noted in the previous comments, earlier cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome have been reported from tropical, lowland areas of Bolivia. The specific hantaviruses involved in these or previous cases for the last several years in Bolivia are not reported.

In the lowland Amazon Basin of Bolivia, the possible hantavirus, its rodent hosts that might be involved in these hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) cases, with their images, include:
- Rio Mamoré virus (small eared pygmy rice rat _Oligoryzomys microtis_ https://www.uwsp.edu/biology/VertebrateCollection/Pages/Vertebrates/Mammals%20of%20Paraguay/Oligoryzomys%20microtis/Oligoryzomys%20microtis.aspx);
- Laguna Negra virus (small vesper mouse _Calomys laucha_ http://www.faunaparaguay.com/calomyslaucha.html and large vesper mouse _C. callosus_; http://www.faunaparaguay.com/Calomys%20callosus%20www.pybio.org%201.jpg);
- Bermejo virus (Chaco rice rat _Oligoryzomys chacoensis_ http://www.faunaparaguay.com/oligorizomyschacoensis.html);
- Oran virus (long-tailed pygmy rice rat _O. longicaudatus_ http://calphotos.berkeley.edu/imgs/512x768/0000_0000/0711/1203.jpeg).

Dr. Jan Clement earlier pointed out the need to be able to differentiate Seoul hantavirus, with its wide distribution around the world, from hantaviruses found in the Americas. - Mod.TY
