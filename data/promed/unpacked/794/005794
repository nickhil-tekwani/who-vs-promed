The outbreak of fatal illness at a funeral wake in Peru has several elements suggestive of bongkrekic acid poisoning. A similar event reported in Mozambique in 2015 was related to consumption of pombe (a fermented corn-based brew) at a funeral in Mozambique. Bongkrekic acid is produced by _Burkholderia gladioli_ pv. _cocovenenans_, which grows in corn flour. Further details of that outbreak are available at https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0379073816304522?via%3Dihub.

[I appreciate Dr Berger sharing this with us. The situation regarding bongkrekic acid is interesting and may be similar to the situation in Peru. The abstract of the above-mentioned article is as follows:

Abstract
In January 2015, 75 people died and 177 were hospitalized in the Mozambique village of Chitima after attending a funeral. The deaths were linked to the consumption of a traditional African beverage called pombe. Samples of the suspect pombe were subjected to myriad analyses and compared to a control sample. Ultimately, non-targeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry screening revealed the presence of the potent toxin bongkrekic acid and its structural isomer, isobongkrekic acid. Quantitative analysis found potentially fatal levels of these toxins in the suspect pombe samples. Bongkrekic acid is known to be produced by the bacterium _Burkholderia gladioli_ pv. _cocovenenans_. This bacterium could not be isolated from the suspect pombe, but bacteria identified as _B. gladioli_ were isolated from corn flour, a starting ingredient in the production of pombe, obtained from the brewer's home. When the bacteria were co-plated with the fungus _Rhizopus oryzae_, which was also isolated from the corn flour, synergistic production of bongkrekic acid was observed. The results suggest a mechanism for bongkrekic acid intoxication, a phenomenon previously thought to be restricted to specific regions of Indonesia and China."

Other articles on the same funeral wake have stated 10 people have died and over 50 are ill (see https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/peru-funeral-food-contaminated-dead-deaths-san-jose-ushua-meat-stew-a8483441.html). Some articles are claiming it was the meat in the stew that sickened/killed people. Other reports believe the illness was linked to an organophosphate in the meat. Organophosophates may be used on animals as well as on other plant sources of food. The type of meat has not been identified in media outlets.

Also of interest is the lack of an outlet describing the clinical signs and symptoms of the individuals affected. No news source mentions any investigation as to what the source of the poisoning was or if any testing is ongoing. There has been no information as to what condition(s) the hospitals are treating for.

Sadly, it remains speculation if this was related to a plant poisoning, a bacterial contamination (as proposed above), a toxin associated with the meat, such as scombroid toxicity, or organophosphate poisoning linked to either vegetables or meat. Any additional information would be appreciated. - Mod.TG
