The State Veterinarian of Texas encourages livestock owners to have their animals vaccinated against anthrax this spring [2020]. "Following last year's [2019] outbreak in Southwest Texas, we encourage livestock owners in the previously affected and surrounding area to consult with their veterinarian about vaccinating animals before warmer weather arrives," said Dr Andy Schwartz, Texas State Veterinarian and Executive Director. "The anthrax vaccine is dependable and proven to protect livestock from the disease."

To be effective, the vaccine must be administered 2 to 4 weeks before a normal outbreak, usually in early spring. The vaccine is available for use in swine, equine, sheep, goats, and cattle. There is no approved vaccine for use in deer.

It is common to see an increase in anthrax cases after periods of wet, cool weather, followed by hot, dry conditions. At that time, animals ingest the anthrax bacteria when they consume contaminated grass and hay or inhale the spores. Outbreaks usually end when cooler weather arrives.

In 2019, the TAHC [Texas Animal Health Commission] received 20 confirmations of anthrax in 5 Texas counties: Crockett, Edwards, Kinney, Maverick, Sutton, and Val Verde. In an effort to gain a better understanding of factors that may have contributed to the outbreak, the TAHC, USDA [US Department of Agriculture], and Texas Parks and Wildlife (TPWD) created a survey for landowners in the affected area. To participate in the survey, please call 512-719-0716.

Anthrax is a bacterial disease caused by _Bacillus anthracis_, a spore-forming bacterium that can remain alive but dormant in the soil for several years. Upon becoming infected, animals typically display symptoms of anthrax within 3 to 7 days. Once symptoms begin, death will usually occur within 48 hours. Anthrax is a reportable disease to the TAHC and anyone suspecting anthrax should notify a local veterinarian or the TAHC at 1-800-550-8242.

[I recommend that members also read the final ProMED posting review of 2019 on the events in Texas last year: Anthrax - USA (11): (TX) review 20191014.6726401 And those of you with graduate students needing fresh air and research topics, read the commentary. A few suggestions.

After an extensive series of outbreaks such as we saw last year (2019) in Texas, there will be an abundance of contaminated soils and maybe some animals, whether livestock or wildlife, with latent infections just waiting for the warmer weather and its negative effects on innate resistance, which briefly put, allows a normally sub-lethal number of germinating spores to kill its host. This new contaminated carcass then provides feeding flies with vegetative cells for blow flies to deposit on nearby shrub leaves, or spore contaminated mouth-parts of female tabanid flies to inject into their next feeding source, quite apart from contaminated blood spilled into the soil. And away we go.

And even if your cattle were not affected last year, your neighbour's cattle may have been, and can be the source for infection this year. And remember tabanid flies will fly over the fences to feed on livestock on nearby ranches and can sometimes reach out some 10+ mi/10-15 km. - Mod.MHJ
