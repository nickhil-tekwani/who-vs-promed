The Ministry of Health obtained specimens to investigate the cause [or causes] that provoked, this past weekend, a large outbreak of gastroenteritis in Santa Rosa, in the province of El Oro. Meanwhile, out of the 405 ill, 10 remain hospitalized with abdominal pain, fever and dehydration.

Mariuxi Mejia, director of Health of El Oro Province, said: "We are doing research into the epidemiological profile and the circumstances under which the food was prepared. It is a comprehensive evaluation," Mejia said.
