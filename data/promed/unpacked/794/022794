On 8 Sep 2009 the Ministry of Health (MoH) in Cameroon reported a
laboratory-confirmed case of yellow fever, identified through routine
yellow fever surveillance. The index case is from Kotto 1 - Bomboko
village, Buea Health District, South-West Province. A reactive mass
vaccination campaign is planned for October 2009 in 2 districts, Buea and
Mbongue, with a target population of 165 138.

The patient is a 61 year old man without history of yellow fever
vaccination who presented with fever, jaundice, and back pain with onset of
symptoms on 27 Jul 2009. The patient consulted a private practitioner in
Buea Health District and a clinical diagnosis of yellow fever was made.

Preliminary testing at the Institut Pasteur of Yaounde suggested the
patient may have yellow fever, a finding confirmed by the regional
reference laboratory at the Institut Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal, where tests
for other haemorrhagic fevers were negative.

During the outbreak investigation, 51 serum samples were collected from
additional suspected cases. Laboratory analysis of the specimens is ongoing
at the Institut Pasteur in Yaounde. As yellow fever outbreaks have occurred
in different parts of Cameroon, the country carried out a national yellow
fever preventive vaccination campaign in May 2009 for the population of 62
districts at high risk. The health district of Buea was not previously
known to be a yellow fever endemic area. This outbreak response campaign
will therefore extend the area protected against future outbreaks.

The country will use vaccine from the global yellow fever vaccine emergency
stockpile, which is managed by the International Coordinating Group for
Yellow Fever Vaccine Provision (YF-ICG) and funded by the GAVI Alliance.

[Yellow fever (YF) has occurred sporadically in West Africa over the past 3
years. YF cases have not been reported in Cameroon in ProMED-mail posts
since 2007. One hopes that this is a single, isolated case of YF.
ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving reports of any additional YF cases
that occur in this area.
