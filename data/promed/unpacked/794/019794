The HSE [Health Service Executive] is investigating 4 cases of meningococcal meningitis/septicaemia reported in the last week of September [2022]. They include 3 confirmed and one possible case of the potentially deadly bug.

Three of the cases are young adults, and one is a child under 10 [years]. The cases were reported from different regions of the country and have no known links with each other. In 2 cases, the people affected have died since their condition was first reported.

The Department of Public Health Mid-West has confirmed it has launched an investigation into the fatal case of "meningococcal disease." It's understood the victim was female and aged under 30 [years]. Close contacts are being identified by public health and will be provided with antibiotics to prevent infection and will also be offered vaccine if appropriate.

"Public Health Mid-West was notified of the case in late September [2022], and concerns a young adult who subsequently sadly died. Close contacts identified by Public Health Mid-West have been contacted and offered treatment in accordance with national guidance," the spokesman said. "Person-to-person spread of meningococcal disease is very unusual, especially with others who are not a household or physically close personal contact," the spokesperson added.

The HSE has urged people to be aware of the symptoms of meningitis and said that parents who suspect their child may have meningitis should call 999 or bring them immediately to the nearest hospital emergency department that deals with children.

What are meningitis and septicaemia? Meningitis and septicaemia are serious, life-threatening illnesses. Meningitis is the swelling of the meninges, which is the lining around the brain and spinal cord, caused mainly by germs entering the body. Septicaemia is blood poisoning caused by the same germs that can cause meningitis. Meningitis and septicaemia are illnesses that can kill in hours. Anyone, anywhere of any age can get meningitis and septicaemia, although some people are at higher risk than others.

What are the causes? There are many different causes of meningitis and septicaemia. Different germs such as bacteria, viruses and fungi can cause meningitis and septicaemia if they invade the body. Bacterial causes are usually more serious than other forms. Viral meningitis is almost never life-threatening and viruses rarely cause septicaemia. Fungal meningitis is very rare in the UK and Ireland but is serious. It usually only affects people with weakened immune systems.

How can I protect myself? There are vaccines available that protect against some of the most common causes of meningitis and septicaemia. These vaccines have successfully reduced the number of cases throughout the world. However, there are still some causes of meningitis and septicaemia which are not vaccine preventable and some vaccines are not routinely provided in some parts of the world.

Being able to recognise the symptoms of meningitis and septicaemia is vital because early recognition and treatment provide the best chance of a good recovery.

Early symptoms can include fever, headache, neck stiffness, vomiting, drowsiness, discomfort from bright light, diarrhoea, muscle pain, stomach cramps, and fever with cold hands and feet.

Treatment of meningitis and septicaemia will depend on what germs have caused the illness. Meningitis and septicaemia caused by bacteria need urgent treatment with antibiotics. Most people recover with no lasting effects, but some who recover from meningitis and septicaemia may be left with a range of serious aftereffects that can dramatically alter their lives.

[We are told in the news report above of a cluster of 3 confirmed cases and one possible case of invasive meningococcal disease (i.e., meningococcal meningitis and/or meningococcemia) reported in the last week of September 2022 from "different regions of the country and have no known links with each other"; 3 cases are young adults and one is a child less than 10 years of age, and 2 have died. However, we are not told if the cases belonged to certain high-risk groups, the serogroup(s) involved, or if the cases were vaccinated against meningococcal disease.

In the United States, 95% of cases of invasive meningococcal disease are sporadic, each case unrelated to the other cases; meningococcal outbreaks account for only about 5% of reported cases. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends:

"All cases of meningococcal disease of the same serogroup should be included in the outbreak case count unless molecular typing indicates that the strain from a case is genetically different than the predominant outbreak strain. In outbreaks with well-defined risk groups, probable cases may be included as outbreak-associated even if they are unable to be confirmed or serogrouped.

"The outbreak threshold for vaccine decision-making should be determined on a case-by-case basis, using the following general guidance:
- Organization-based outbreak: 2-3 outbreak-associated cases within an organization during a 3-month period
- Community-based outbreak: Multiple outbreak-associated cases with an incidence of meningococcal disease that is above the expected incidence in a community during a 3-month period" (https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/downloads/meningococcal-outbreak-guidance.pdf).

Clusters of invasive meningococcal disease have been reported in cities in North America, Europe, and Australia among men who have sex with men (MSM), associated with a high case fatality rate. All cases were caused by hypervirulent serogroup C strains of _Neisseria meningitidis_ (MenC) belonging to the sequence type (ST) 11 (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0160126). Please see ProMED post Meningitis, meningococcal - USA (08): (FL) fatal, more cases, 17 counties 20220914.8705585.

More information from knowledgeable sources concerning these cases of invasive meningococcal disease in Ireland would be appreciated. - Mod.ML
