Re: Alkhurma virus - Saudi Arabia 20180401.5722789
--------------------------------------------------
In response to the mentioned ProMED mail post; the Saudi Ministry of Health (MoH) would like to make the following comments:

1. From the beginning of 2018 until date [Tue 3 Apr 2018], there has been no confirmed case of Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever (AHF) reported anywhere in Saudi Arabia. Active surveillance for AHF has long been embedded in our nationwide viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) surveillance program. In Najran where AHF is endemic, we have had 21 cases of suspected VHF this year [2018]; none has been positive for AHF virus (AHFV).

2. MoH requires that all suspected cases of hemorrhagic fever be tested in parallel for Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever virus (AHFV), dengue virus and Rift valley fever virus.

3. Transmission of the causal virus for AHF can and does occur through consumption of unpasteurized milk. This has been reported in the literature (1). The MOH regularly advocates, and in coordination with other stakeholders (the Ministry of Environment, Water and Agriculture as well as the Ministry of Municipalities) against the consumption of unpasteurized milk to prevent transmission of milk-borne pathogens, including AHFV.

4. While most forms of livestock (camels, sheep and goats) have been implicated in AHFV transmission, cows have not. Its inclusion in the post might be due to a flawed translation of the Arabic word for livestock as cow/cattle. Presently, there is no evidence that cats and rabbits play any role in AHFV epidemiology.

5. Ticks probably do play a role in AHFV transmission. Although tick linked seasonal transmission occurs with the Kyasanur forest disease virus (KFDV) in India (for which AHFV is a genetic variant), this may not wholly apply to AHFV due to differences in niches, vectors and the intermediate animal hosts. For example, the biology of the ground dwelling AHFV soft tick vector, _Ornithodoros savignyi_ (2), including its interrupted nocturnal feeding habit may contribute to the rarity of outbreaks. Secondly, again unlike for KFVD, different types of livestock serve as intermediate hosts for AHFV.

6. The name Alkhurma is from the name of a town outside Taif and not the name of a kind of sheep. The butcher who was the 1st ever reported case was exposed to a sheep sourced from Alkhurma.

7. We are in support of enhanced surveillance for AHFV infection in Africa where it also occurs. It may be mistaken for other endemic febrile infections like malaria.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Abdullah M. Assiri for this very instructive overview of AHFV in Saudi Arabia and their proactive surveillance of infections by this virus there and their preventive measures. It is curious that the previous AHFV post (see Alkhurma virus - Saudi Arabia 20180401.5722789) quoted the source indicating that government hospitals in Jeddah have been alerted following a fresh outbreak of Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever. Dr Assiri's comment above indicates that there have been no cases this year [2018] and hence, no fresh outbreak, although the risk of one remains. - Mod.TY
