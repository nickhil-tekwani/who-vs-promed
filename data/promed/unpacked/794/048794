The [Massachusetts] state Department of Public Health is urging
consumers to throw away any shellfish harvested and sold after 29 Apr
2011 from the southern sections of the Nauset Marsh estuary due to a
local red tide outbreak. This includes waters on the border of Eastham
and Orleans [eastern or outer Cape Cod, Massachusetts].

The estuary has had red tide outbreaks for 26 of the past 35 years.
Shellfishermen have been banned from harvesting shellfish, sometimes
for months in the spring and summer, because the red tide algae
produce toxins that become concentrated in shellfish meat when they
eat the free-floating algae.

According to a map released by the department, the tide closure is
mostly in Orleans' waters. It covers the southern portion of the
Nauset estuary, mostly south and west of Nauset Inlet, including
Nauset Harbor, Mill Pond, Roberts, Woods and Rachel's coves, and the
waters connecting them as well as all of Town Cove.

Only portions of Nauset Estuary south of Fort Hill Area are closed in
Eastham. The northern waters including Salt Pond Bay, Nauset Bay, the
various channels, and Salt Pond remain open.

[Red tide is caused by several toxic algae. Depending upon the toxin,
it is also known as paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), because it
causes shellfish to be toxic for consumption.

_Alexandrium_ spp. is one of many members of this genus. Some members
may not be toxic. However, generally, the genus is found in coastal
waters high in nitrogen content. These organisms produce a neurotoxin,
like many of the organisms capable of causing paralytic shellfish
poisoning (PSP). The neurotoxin is considered fatal for humans
consuming contaminated shellfish and may be dangerous to humans and
animals who swim in waters that are 'blooming' with the organism.
Ocean spray containing the organism may also cause illnesses,
including rashes and eye irritation in people. Some species of this
genus are capable of causing 'red tide' that may be visible for long
distances along a coast line.

PSP is a significant problem in several geographic areas, especially
on both the east and west coasts of the US. Produced by several
closely related species in the genus _Alexandrium_, PSP toxins are
responsible for persistent problems due to their accumulation in
filter-feeding shellfish, but they also move through the food chain,
affecting zooplankton, fish larvae, adult fish, and even birds and
marine mammals.

_Alexandrium_ blooms generally do not involve large-cell
accumulations that discolor the water and may instead be invisible
below the water surface. Low-density populations can cause severe
problems due to the high potency of the toxins produced. Furthermore,
_Alexandrium_ spp. can grow in relatively pristine waters, and it is
difficult to argue that anthropogenic nutrient inputs are stimulating
the blooms. These characteristics are important when considering
mitigation and control strategies.

Often PSP is associated with red tides or algal blooms. Red tide is
caused by an organism called _Karenia brevis_, which in high
concentration can make the water look red. The organism releases a
toxin that paralyzes the respiratory system of fish and other marine
life.

Airborne toxins, water spray, and splashes in an outbreak have kept
people from beaches while leaving others with irritated eyes and
throats. Red tide irritates the skin of people exposed to it and can
cause itchy eyes, scratchy throats, and coughs. Harvesting from
affected areas for personal consumption is discouraged. Red tide
poisoning symptoms include nausea and dizziness and may last for
several days.

Previously the organism causing red tide was known as _Gymnodinium
breve_, but it has been reclassified in the taxonomy of
dinoflagellates. Its new name is _Karenia brevis_, or _K. brevis_.
Karenia was chosen in honor of Dr Karen Steidinger, a prominent red
tide scientist from the Florida Marine Research Institute in St
Petersburg, FL
