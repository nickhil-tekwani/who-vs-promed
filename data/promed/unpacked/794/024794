Angola: Marburg haemorrhagic fever outbreak - WHO update 15
-----------------------------------------------------------
Update
------
The Ministry of Health in Angola has reported 266 cases of Marburg
haemorrhagic fever, 244 of them fatal. In Uige Province, which remains the
epicentre of the outbreak, 253 cases, 233 of which have been fatal, were
reported as of Thu 21 Apr 2005.
Assessment of the outbreak
--------------------------
The international response to the outbreak in Angola began one month ago,
on 22 Mar 2005. The features of Marburg haemorrhagic fever, and the
conditions in Angola, have been an extreme test of international capacity
to hold emerging diseases at bay. The outbreak in Angola is the largest and
deadliest on record for this rare disease, which is presently showing a
case fatality rate higher than 90 per cent. For comparison, outbreaks of
the closely related Ebola haemorrhagic fever have shown mortality rates
ranging, according to the virus strain involved, from 53 to 88 per cent.
The only other large outbreak of Marburg haemorrhagic fever, in the
Democratic Republic of Congo from 1998 through 2000, had a case fatality of
83 per cent.
2 factors make the rapid detection of outbreaks of Marburg haemorrhagic
fever difficult: the extreme rarity of this disease and its similarity to
other diseases seen in countries where deaths from infectious diseases are
common. Neither the source nor the date of the initial cases in Angola can
be presently identified with any certainty.
The number of cases began increasing in February and then, more
dramatically, in March. On 21 Mar 2005, Marburg virus was detected in
patient samples sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta (USA), and WHO assistance was requested by the Ministry of Health
in Angola. The operational response began the following day. As known from
extensive experience with outbreaks of other viral haemorrhagic fevers,
including Ebola, outbreaks of Marburg can be brought to an end using
classic public health interventions. In theory, the measures needed to end
the Angolan outbreak are few in number and straightforward in nature. Rapid
detection and isolation of patients, tracing and management of their close
contacts, infection control in hospitals and protective clothing for staff
work to interrupt chains of transmission and thus seal off opportunities
for further spread.
Such straightforward measures are complicated by the distinct features of
this disease. The sudden onset, dramatic symptoms, and rapid deterioration
of patients, and the absence of a vaccine and effective treatment,
invariably incite great anxiety in affected populations. This anxiety, in
turn, can interfere with control operations, especially when communities
begin hiding cases and bodies because of suspicions about the safety of
hospitals.
In the current outbreak, such suspicions are understandable. Very few
patients with laboratory-confirmed Marburg haemorrhagic fever have
survived; most hospitalized patients have died within a day or 2 following
admission. For affected communities, staff from the mobile teams, fully
suited in protective gear, are seen as taking away relatives and loved ones
who may never again be seen alive.
WHO staff in Uige have today reported further signs that community
attitudes are improving, though hostility towards the mobile teams remains
of concern in one area known to have recent cases and deaths. Efforts to
sensitize affected communities are continuing, with local volunteers
supported by Portuguese-speaking experts from Brazil and Mozambique.
Conditions in Angola -- a country weakened by almost 3 decades of civil
unrest -- have presented additional challenges. Supplies of water and
electricity are intermittent, also in health care facilities. Weakened
infrastructures, including those for communications and transportation, are
another problem. Yesterday, the WHO office in Uige was informed of a death
in another municipality, but was unable to collect the body for safe burial
because of poor road conditions.
Fortunately, spread of the disease beyond Uige Province, located in the
interior of the country, has been limited. Of the 266 cases and 244 deaths,
197 cases and 183 deaths occurred in Uige municipality. Other
municipalities in Uige Province account for an additional 56 cases and 50
deaths.
WHO believes that the risk of international spread is low. No foreign
nationals, with the exception of those involved in the direct care of
patients, have been infected. There is no evidence that people can spread
the virus before the onset of symptoms. Shortly after symptom onset,
patients become rapidly and visibly very ill WHO is optimistic that the
outbreak can be controlled if present activities continue with sufficient
vigour. All the essential containment measures are being applied with
extensive international support, including more than 60 international staff
drawn from institutions in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network,
and the cooperation of national authorities and experts.
Tools and methods developed during international responses to outbreaks of
other diseases have all been brought to bear on the present outbreak, and
the success of this collaborative effort has surpassed initial
expectations. Needs, which have ranged from satellite telephones and
hand-held radio sets to vehicles, protective equipment, disinfectants, and
specialized staff, have been rapidly communicated and immediately met.
WHO and its partners are nonetheless prepared and organized to continue the
outbreak response for several additional months, if this is needed. An
important present goal is to transfer skills and responsibilities for
outbreak response to national staff, and training efforts are under way
with this goal in mind.
