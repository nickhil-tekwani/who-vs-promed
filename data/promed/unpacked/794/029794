Health officials have narrowed their search for the source of an _E. coli_ [O157] outbreak in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick to about a dozen possible sources.

"When you look at the geographic spread, the time frame of exposure and the food histories, from the outset, our hypothesis -- and its a fairly solid one -- is that we're looking at some kind of manufactured food product or a food that's been processed in some way that's been widely distributed," said Dr Robert Strang, Nova Scotia's chief public health officer. "Right now we're looking at exposures more through restaurants rather than a food that's been distributed through groceries."

Another 3 cases were confirmed today, 7 Jan 2013, bringing the number across Nova Scotia to 10 since initially reported a week ago. 5 have been in the Capital health district, 2 in Guysborough Antigonish Strait, and 1 each in the Pictou, Cumberland, and Colchester-East Hants districts.

All 10 patients have been seen by doctors and are recovering or already have, Strang told reporters this afternoon, 7 Jan 2013. They range in age from 18-83, and 2 were still in hospital.

The incubation period for _E. coli_ is 1 to 10 days [actually up to 12 days - Mod.LL], so new cases may be reported far apart but originate around the same time, Strang said.
