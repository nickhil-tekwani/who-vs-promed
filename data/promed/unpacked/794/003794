Three months after 2 massive earthquakes struck Nepal in 2015, BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences, Dharan [Province One] alerted the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division about 6 children with unusual fever and severe respiratory features. 4 children died during treatment as serum samples were collected for subsequent tests in Kathmandu and Bangkok that confirmed a scrub typhus outbreak. By the end of the year [2015], 101 cases were confirmed in 16 districts and 4 more people succumbed to the disease.

"Nepal had never reported so many cases of scrub typhus at once and we also lacked specialists to deal with the disease," former director at the division, Dr Baburam Marasini told the Post. "After entomologists from the World Health Organisation and an expert from India arrived, a surveillance system was set up across the country, specially in the area the 6 children came from."

The magnitude of the outbreak escalated in 2016 -- 831 cases of scrub typhus were reported in 47 districts and 14 people died by the end of that year [2016].

Scrub typhus, also known as bush typhus is an infectious disease that is caused by the parasite _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, a mite-borne bacterium, and spreads in the human body after they are bitten by infected chiggers (larval mites) found in mice.

Authorities have confirmed 1435 people infected with scrub typhus across the country since then [2017-2018]. 10 people have died to date. Scrub typhus continues to rise and spread to the hills and mountains as temperatures become more favourable for parasites, epidemiologists warned. Shukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital Chief Consultant Dr Anup Bastola said, "The earthquake rendered many people homeless and forced them to live in temporary shelters where they might have acquired scrub typhus because of rodent infestation. On checking the background of most of our patients diagnosed with the disease, we see that they are still living in temporary shelters."

Dr Bastola is one of the authors of the report on the outbreak of scrub typhus in the aftermath of earthquake in Nepal. The report says over 60% of the patients admitted and diagnosed with scrub typhus at Sukraraj Hospital from August to October 2015 came from Dhading district, followed by Nuwakot, Sarlahi, Kavre, and Parsa. The earthquake in 2015 devastated all districts except Sarlahi. A 2017 report by the National Health Research Council reveals the highest incidence of the disease in Chitwan district, with 34.4% of the total patients diagnosed with scrub typhus from the period of January to October [2017].

The council's report clearly indicates scrub typhus as a re-emerging disease problem in Nepal. The disease infected children and young adults the most, followed by women -- more than half of the cases in Chitwan were below 30 years of age, of that 14.5% were children below 10 years of age. "The incidence of the disease is higher among women and children because of their exposure to vegetation. The outbreak was similar in 2015 while many people were living in temporary shelters," said Dr Marasini.

Division Vector Control Inspector Rajendra Mishra told the Post, "Rodents in Chitwan still test positive for chigger mites and the risks are higher for people in Chitwan because most of them are involved in agriculture. People working in agricultural sector should use clothes to cover their entire body. People should avoid areas with lots of vegetation and bushes where mites may be found."

[Scrub typhus is caused by _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, a rickettsia-like microorganism that is transmitted by chiggers, the larval stage of trombiculid mites, which feed on the skin cells of animals, including humans and rodents. After feeding on their hosts, chiggers drop to the ground and become nymphs, which then mature into adults that feed only on plant materials. The cutaneous reaction to chiggers leaves a characteristic black eschar that is useful for making the diagnosis. Humans become infected when they accidentally encroach in an area where the infected chigger-rodent cycle is occurring, most often areas of low-lying scrub brush or transitional vegetation. Rodents may serve as reservoirs, although transovarial transmission in mites is the dominant mechanism for maintenance of _O. tsutsugamushi_ in nature (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/9/12/03-0212_article).

An earthquake occurred in Nepal on 25 Apr 2015 that killed nearly 9000 people and injured nearly 22 000 with hundreds of thousands of Nepalese made homeless across many districts of the country (https://www.worldvision.org/disaster-relief-news-stories/2015-nepal-earthquake-facts). In 2016, 70% of people displaced by the earthquake, were still living in substandard temporary shelters (https://www.worldvision.org/disaster-relief-news-stories/2015-nepal-earthquake-facts).

The diagnosis of scrub typhus in Nepal has increased since the 2015 earthquake with 101 cases of scrub typhus in 2015, 831 cases in 2016, and 1435 cases in 2017-2018. The news article attributes this increase in scrub typhus cases to people to living in temporary shelters where they might have been exposed the infected chiggers, but some of this increase may be due to enhanced surveillance for this disease.
