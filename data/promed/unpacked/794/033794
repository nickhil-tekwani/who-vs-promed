Students on red alert after mumps outbreak
------------------------------------------
Students at the University of Gloucestershire [in the west of England] are
on alert following a mumps outbreak. A total of 10 students in Cheltenham
and Gloucester have been diagnosed with the infection and the number is
expected to rise. Health officials are now working at the university's 4
campuses in Cheltenham and Gloucester, which house more than 9500 full and
part time students, in an effort to contain the outbreak. The Health
Protection Agency is working with the university and is checking all
suspected cases of the illness that have been reported in the past 2 weeks.

A warning letter has been sent to all students from the university's
medical officer, urging them to check for symptoms. Students and staff
under the age of 25 have been asked to check if they have had the MMR
[measles, mumps, and rubella] jab and consult their GP [general
practitioner]. They are also urged not to mix with other students for a
week if mumps is suspected. Mumps virus is highly contagious and in severe
cases can cause deafness, viral meningitis, and infertility.

Lawrence Knight, of the Health Protection Agency South West, said: "We are
awaiting the test results from 3 students to ascertain whether these are
isolated [cases]. The university's medical officer has taken a proactive
approach by warning students, and that is quite right so people can look
out for symptoms [of] mumps. This is an illness that can spread as easily
as the flu. For some it is a mild infection and for others it is much more
unpleasant. We would urge anyone who is concerned about symptoms to see
their GP as soon as possible."

A spokesman for the University of Gloucestershire said: "We believe around
10 students have contracted mumps and have been diagnosed at the
university's medical centre. This is a small isolated outbreak. Students
living in Gloucestershire can go to their local GP or to the university
medical centre for an MMR jab if they are concerned."

Andrew Gravells, chairman of Gloucestershire's Health Overview and Scrutiny
Committee, added: "This could be potentially very serious for the people
affected and I would urge students and staff at the university to act on
the good advice that's being made available." Cheltenham based students or
staff can call the University Medical Centre on 01242 714400. Gloucester
students can call 01452 522709.

[Mumps virus infection in young adults is likely to be a consequence of
incomplete or absence of MMR vaccination in their earlier years. The
symptoms of mumps are fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, and loss of
appetite; followed by swelling of salivary glands. The parotid salivary
glands are most frequently affected. Severe complications are rare, but
mumps can cause inflammation of the brain and/or tissue covering the brain
and spinal cord (encephalitis/meningitis), inflammation of the testicles
(orchitis), inflammation of the ovaries and/or breasts (oophoritis and
mastitis), spontaneous abortion, and deafness.

Mumps virus replicates in the upper respiratory tract and is spread through
direct contact with respiratory secretions or saliva or through fomites.
The infectious period, or time that an infected person can transmit mumps
to a non-infected person, is from 3 days before symptoms appear to about 9
days after the symptoms appear. The incubation time, which is the period
from when a person is exposed to virus to the onset of any symptoms, can
vary from 16 to 18 days (range 12-25 days).
