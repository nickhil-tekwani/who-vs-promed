FIRST KNOWN OUTBREAK OF COLONIZING VANCOMYCIN-RESISTANT ENTEROCOCCI IN QUEBEC
Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are a threat to public health,
particularly because clinical infections linked to vancomycin resistance
are difficult or impossible to treat, and the mechanism that leads to VRE
can be transmitted to other more virulent bacteria such as _Staphylococcus
aureus_.
VRE first appeared in the United States in 1988. From 1989 to 1993, the
rate of hospital-acquired infections due to VRE rose from 0.3% to 7.9%. The
first documented outbreak in Canada occurred in the fall of 1995 at a
Toronto university hospital [Ontario].
This report describes the first known outbreak of colonizing VRE in Quebec,
which occurred in a Monteregie hospital on the southwest shore of Montreal.
Between September and December 1996, 20 cases were identified...
Canada CDR Editorial Comment
The report of the first vancomycin-resistant enterococci VRE outbreak in
Quebec, described above, is significant in that the colonized patients were
elderly and had not received health-care outside of Quebec. The VRE strain
in the medium-sized, regional hospital near Montreal was the same as the
VRE strain found in a university hospital in Montreal. Possible mechanisms
of transmission included staff, patient(s), and equipment. The infection
control measures implemented are described.
Surveillance of enterococcal sensitivity on all clinical specimens
indicated that six health-care floors had been affected by the time the
initial cases were found. Infection control measures taken at the Centre
hospitalier regional du Suroit were congruent with recommendations made by
Health Canada in Infection Control Guidelines: Preventing the Spread of
Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci (VRE) in Canada.
These include screening of patients at risk of VRE infection or
colonization, using a single room with a private bathroom for VRE-colonized
patients, educating patients and family members, wearing gloves and gowns
by health-care personnel entering the room of the patient in isolation,
washing hands with an antiseptic agent, dedicating the use of equipment to
the colonized patient only, cleaning and disinfecting equipment removed
from the isolation room, and cleaning and disinfecting environmental
surfaces that may have been contaminated.

[This story, although dated, is posted because it points out how highly
antibiotic-resistant strains can be transferred between hospitals by the
movement of staff, who may attend at more than one hospital, patients &
even equipment who may be transferred from one hospital to another. It
also shows how the infection can spread all over a hospital before being
detected - Mod.JW]
