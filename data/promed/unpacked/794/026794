The circulation of Rift Valley fever (RVF) continues in Mayotte. There have been 114 human RVF cases and 84 animal outbreaks. This past week, 7 new human cases and 9 in animals were reported to the LRA. Human cases remain concentrated in the center and northwest of the island.

An animal disease of viral origin, Rift Valley fever mainly affects domestic ruminants (cattle, sheep, goats), causing abortions and high mortality in young animals. It can be transmitted from the sick animal to humans.

During the past week, 9 new animal foci and 7 new human cases have been reported, for a total of 84 animal foci and 114 human cases since the 1st cases occurred at the end of November 2018.

In this epidemic context, the prefecture of Mayotte, in collaboration with the ARS Indian Ocean and the Directorate of Food, Agriculture and Forestry of Mayotte (DAAF) reminds people of the importance of prevention measures to protect themselves from disease.

Epidemiological situation as of 29 Mar 2019:
In total, since the beginning of the epidemic (end of November):
- Samples taken by veterinarians on sick animals or during abortions have identified 84 outbreaks of sick animals (including 69 cattle). The animal foci are mainly located in the center and northwest of the island, but some animal foci have been found in the commune of Mamoudzou.

- 114 human cases of RVF have been reported to the monitoring and health emergencies platform of the ARS OI (CVAGS) of Mayotte by the CHM laboratory.

- Since the beginning of the health alert, human cases have remained mainly in the center and northwest of the island.

Recommendations
Transmission by ruminants
In ruminants:
- Monitoring of Rift Valley fever includes monitoring of abortions. Thus, farmers are required to report promptly to veterinarians any abortions or stillbirths occurring in their animals or sick animals in order to take samples for diagnosis of the disease.
- An order prohibiting the marketing of untreated milk has been in force since 27 Feb 2019.
- A decree prohibiting the export of live animals, raw meat and milk produced by the ruminant farms of the country has been in force since 20 Mar 2019.

In humans:
- The disease is usually manifested by an influenza-like illness: high fever (39 C [98.6 F]), muscle and/or joint pain, severe headache, tiredness. In the vast majority of cases, healing occurs within a few days.
- It is recommended to consult a doctor as soon as the signs appear so that samples for diagnosis of the disease can be taken.

Recommendations to protect against disease:
For farmers and people in contact with animals:
- Wash hands with soap after contact with domestic ruminants (cattle, sheep, goats).
- Do not handle unprotected or diseased animals or abortion products without protection.
- Do not handle animal carcasses without protection.
- Wear gloves, goggles and especially a mask for the slaughter of any animal. Infected animals may have no signs, although they can transmit the virus.

For food:
- Boil the milk
- Do not consume curd unless it has been boiled and curdled with lactic fermenters.
- Wash hands after cutting meat.
- Do not eat uncooked meat.
- Do not consume the meat of a sick animal.

To protect yourself from mosquito bites:
- Eliminate breeding sites, empty all containers that may contain water.
- Use mosquito nets and repellents.

In case of appearance of symptoms:
- Consult your doctor immediately.

[Cases of Rift Valley fever in humans and livestock continue to increase slowly on Mayotte Island.

ProMED-mail posted a summary of the EU - Health and Food Safety DG - Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed (SCPAFF) 21 Mar 2019 committee meeting (see Rift Valley fever - Mayotte (06): animal, human, control, epidemiology 20190328.6391591) that lists the same precautions as above. In this post, Mod.AS commented that "the introduction of RVF could have occurred either by traded animals or windborne infected vectors. The tropical ecological/climatic situation in Mayotte is not similar to the East African situation (and consequent RVF epidemiology), characterised by periodic exacerbations of latent endemic foci of infection or dormant mosquito larvae."

It would be of interest to know whether _Aedes_ vector mosquitoes are transmitting RVF virus on Mayotte and whether they are transovarially transmitting the virus to their eggs, as is the case in West Africa. These eggs can persist for long periods of time until flooded, when they hatch and develop into infected adults that can transmit the virus. This is not likely to occur if other genera of vector mosquitoes are transmitting the virus on Mayotte, in which case the outbreak can be expected to eventually die out. - Mod.TY
