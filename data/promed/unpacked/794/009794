South Korean officials are vowing to speed up efforts to launch a public coronavirus vaccination programme as the country yesterday [28 Dec 2020] announced it had detected its 1st cases of the virus variant linked to the rapid rise in infections in Britain. The new variant, thought to be more transmissible than others currently circulating, was found in 3 people who had entered South Korea from London last Tuesday [22 Dec 2020], the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) said.

Overall, the KDCA reported 808 new cases as at midnight on Sunday [27 Dec 2020], the lowest since a record 1241 infections were logged last Friday [25 Dec 2020]. The authorities cautioned that the drop may be due to less testing done over the weekend and the Christmas holiday, and said on Sunday [27 Dec 2020] that they would be extending social distancing measures until early next month [January 2021].

South Korea's government has faced mounting domestic criticism over its vaccine procurement and roll-out plans, which call for the 1st vaccinations to begin in the 1st quarter of next year [2021], months after places such as the United States and the European Union. Regulators will shorten the period required to approve vaccines and treatments from an average of 180 days to as little as 40 days, the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety announced on Sunday [27 Dec 2020]. An additional approval process for the distribution and sale of vaccines, which usually takes several months, will be shortened to around 20 days, the ministry said.

Medical workers and elderly residents will begin receiving the vaccinations in February [2021], and plans to vaccinate the broader public are accelerating, presidential chief of staff Noh Young-min said on Sunday [27 Dec 2020]. "The government is doing all it can to advance this timeframe and is also making progress," he said.

South Korea has said it plans to buy enough doses to eventually vaccinate 46 million people or more than 85 per cent of its population. The presidential chief of staff said the authorities expected South Korea's population to reach a level of herd immunity through the vaccines as fast as or faster than many other countries.

South Korea has reported a total of 57 680 coronavirus cases, with 819 deaths.

Finland has become the latest European country to report a case of the more contagious coronavirus variant first identified in Britain. Health officials said today [28 Dec 2020] that a Finnish citizen who had recently arrived from Britain for a Christmas holiday was diagnosed with the new COVID-19 variant in the south eastern Kymenlaakso region over the weekend. The person's recent connections were traced and his family members have been isolated. Finnish health officials said they believed the variant hasn't spread further.

Authorities have urged all those who arrived from Britain since [7 Dec 2020] to get a coronavirus test. Last week [week of 21 Dec 2020], Finland halted all scheduled flights with Britain until early January [2021].

Nordic neighbors Sweden and Norway reported their 1st cases of the new COVID-19 variant on Saturday [26 Dec 2020] and Sunday [27 Dec 2020], respectively. Denmark reported its 1st such case earlier in December [2020].

It was confirmed that a woman arriving at Narita Airport from South Africa on [19 Dec 2020] was infected with a new mutated coronavirus that was different from the one spreading in the United Kingdom. This is the 1st time that an infection with this virus has been found by inspection at a domestic quarantine station.

According to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, the infection was confirmed in a woman in her 30s who arrived at Narita Airport from South Africa on [19 Dec 2020] Inspections at the airport quarantine station confirmed infection with the new coronavirus, and then the samples collected were analyzed by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and found to be a mutated virus found in South Africa....although it is different from the mutant virus that is spreading in the United Kingdom, it is said that it [too] may be more infectious than a normal virus.

In addition, it was newly confirmed that 6 men and women in their teens to 40s who arrived at Haneda Airport from the United Kingdom from [1 to 24 Dec 2020] were infected with the mutant virus that is spreading locally. This time, the 7 people who were confirmed to be infected were waiting at the accommodation facility, so none of them had close contact with them [sic]. This brings the total number of confirmed infections [with] the mutant virus to 15 people [I cannot derive this total from this report. - Mod.SH].

Jordan on Sunday [27 Dec 2020] confirmed 2 cases of a particularly infectious coronavirus variant in a man and his wife who had arrived from Britain. Health minister Nazir Obeidat said the Jordanian couple travelled to the kingdom on [19 Dec 2020] and were found to be infected with the new strain of the virus after being tested and isolated. The couple were still in quarantine and being monitored by medical experts according to virus protocols, Obeidat said, adding they were both in "excellent health" condition.

Jordan has barred flights from the UK since Monday [28 or 21 Dec 2020?], with the ban to be enforced until [3 Jan 2021]. The Middle Eastern country has officially recorded more than 286 356 cases of the novel coronavirus and over 3729 deaths.

The 1st 2 confirmed cases of a particularly infectious COVID-19 variant that recently emerged in the United Kingdom have been confirmed in Canada, health authorities said on Saturday [26 Dec 2020]. In a statement, Barbara Yaffe, acting chief medical officer for Ontario, said, "The cases are a couple from Durham with no known travel history, exposure or high-risk contacts." The health officials said that the couple has been placed in isolation, the same day that Ontario reimposed a lockdown for several weeks due to a surge in cases of coronavirus in the province since early December [2020]. "This further reinforces the need for Ontarians to stay home as much as possible and continue to follow all public health advice, including the provincewide shutdown measures beginning today," Dr Yaffe said.

Scientists say the new UK virus is about 40%-70% more transmissible than the original strain. Several other countries, including Australia, Italy, and the Netherlands say they [have] detected cases of the new strain.

Ontario reported 4301 new cases over the past 2 days on Saturday [26 Dec 2020], with the province seeing more than 2000 cases per day for 12 consecutive days. Last week, Canada extended to [6 Jan 2021] a ban on passenger flights arriving from Britain and expanded enhanced screening and monitoring measures to travelers arriving from South Africa, citing the rise of the more infectious variant.

Canada has so far reported 541 616 cases of coronavirus, including 14 800 deaths.

[This new variant has clearly been doing an around the world tour. And we are definitely in a "seek and ye shall find" state. The report from Canada above is telling -- the infected individuals do not have a history of travel nor known high risk contacts... [Their place of residence, "Durham", is presumably the one in Ontario. - Mod.SH]. The USA has not reported any confirmed cases but I would be very surprised if, once the genomic testing is increased, the variant(s) aren't identified as already circulating.... And similarly with Latin America and the Caribbean where there are strong ties to Europe and the UK. - Mod.MPP]

Provinces with a high number of COVID-19 cases must maximise disease control measures, or new local cases could rise to thousands or even tens of thousands per day by mid-January [2021], according to a government official. "If nothing is done, daily new cases could soar to 4 or 5 digits this month [December 2020] or by the middle of next month [January 2021]," Dr Taweesilp Visanuyothin, spokesman for the Center for COVID-19 Situation Administration (CCSA), said on Monday [28 Dec 2020] after reviewing Public Health Ministry data. "But if we cooperate with one another, the curve will be 45 degrees and new daily new cases will be at 3 digits. "The best solution is to refrain from socialising, and then the graph will run flat," Dr Taweesilp said.

Gen Nathapol Nakpanit, secretary-general of the National Security Council and the chair of the CCSA meeting on Monday [28 Dec 2020], wanted authorities in all provinces named as "maximum control zones" and "control zones" to implement all their COVID-19 prevention measures in order to keep the daily increment of cases at 3 digits, the spokesman said. The "maximum control zone" tag refers to provinces that already have a considerable number of COVID-19 cases. The "control zone" covers provinces with more than 10 cases and rising.

The implementation of control measures in the provinces depends on cooperation from government officials, business operators and local people, Dr Taweesilp said. "We will be monitoring how you are best able to contribute before considering escalating to measures [that would be] deemed as strong medicine."

The CCSA on Monday [28 Dec 2020] reported 144 new COVID-19 cases, including 115 locally-transmitted infections and 14 migrant workers, over the past 24 hours.

The breakdown of local infections by province was 56 in Rayong, 19 in Bangkok, 18 in Nakhon Pathom, 6 in Chon Buri, 5 in Samut Prakan, 3 in Nonthaburi, 2 each in Nakhon Nayok and Pathum Thani, and one each in Sukhothai, Samut Sakhon, Lop Buri, and Chiang Mai.

In "maximum control zones", infected and at-risk people, businesses, and activities must be quickly identified. Infected people are admitted to field hospitals and at-risk people are quarantined. At-risk premises are closed or have their operating hours limited. Transport of migrant workers out of the area is banned, while transportation for everyone is restricted. Working from home is encouraged. Education moves online. All activities involving crowds of people are banned. Maximum COVID-19 prevention measures are imposed at workplaces, factories, and workers' dormitories.

In "control zones", infected and at-risk people, as well as at-risk businesses and activities, are quickly identified and crowded gatherings are prohibited.

[From the latest updates on confirmed cases of COVID-19 related to the recent detection as of 16:30 on 28 Dec 2020 by Thai Press (https://www.facebook.com/102229915029914/posts/146642613921977/ in Thai), a total of 44 provinces are affected, including:
- Samut Sakhon (1590 cases)
- Bangkok (94)
- Rayong (92)
- Nakhon Pathom (53)
- Chonburi (24)
- Samut Prakan (22)
- Phetchaburi, Nonthaburi, and Samut Songkram (18 cases each)
- Tak (12)
- Chachoengsao (11)
- Suphan Buri and Ratchaburi (9 cases each)
- Krabi, Saraburi, and Pathum Thani (8 cases each)
- Chaiyaphum and Nakhon Ratchasima (7)
- Chai Nat (6)
- Phichit and Ayuthaya (4 cases each)
- Khon Kaen and Phuket (3 cases each)
- Kamphaeng Phet, Nakhon Nayok, Nakhon Sawan, Prachin Buri, Songkhla, Satun, Uttaradit (2 cases each)
- Chiang Mai, Trang, Nakhon Sri Thammarat, Narathiwat, Prachuap Khiri Khan, Phetchabun, Lopburi, Loei, Sukhothai, Surat Thani, Surin, Ang Thong, Udon Thani, and Ubon Ratchathani (one case each)

Since 17 Dec 2020, when the 1st cluster of COVID-19 was detected in Samut Sakhon province, the infection has spread to 44 provinces at present, with the majority directly linked with Samut Sakhon province. It is alarming that, in addition to the identified cases providing services in public, clusters confirmed out of Samut Sakhon spread the infection to other provinces.

Despite the escalating new case detection on a daily basis, the moderator observes that public areas in Bangkok are commonly crowded with people going through worry-free daily activities, without proper physical distancing. Hence, maximizing preventive and control measures is critically in need across the country. - Mod.YMA

[3] Duration of viral shedding in immunocompromised hosts

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Detection of replication-competent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the most reliable indicator of contagiousness. [1] Although the duration of live-virus shedding is well-characterized in immunocompetent patients with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), little is known about how long immunocompromised patients are contagious. Consequently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines on transmission-based precautions for immunocompromised patients are based on limited data. [2]

In the current study, we used cell cultures to detect viable virus in serially collected respiratory samples (nasopharyngeal and sputum samples) obtained from 20 immunocompromised patients who had COVID-19 (Figure 1A). These patients included 18 recipients of hematopoietic stem-cell transplants or chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy and 2 patients with lymphoma. COVID-19 was diagnosed between [10 Mar and 20 Apr 2020], with the use of a modified CDC nucleic acid amplification test. Live virus was isolated in Vero cells, and genetic variants were identified by whole-genome sequencing of nasopharyngeal and cultured specimens (see the Supplemental Methods section of the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org). The patients' demographic characteristics, medical history, and clinical course of COVID-19 were abstracted from medical records (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix).

Of the 20 patients, 15 were receiving active treatment or chemotherapy. 11 had severe COVID-19. A total of 78 samples were collected from the 20 patients; 57 samples were obtained in the time periods shown in Figure S1. Viral RNA was detected for up to 78 days after the onset of symptoms (interquartile range, 24 to 64 days). Viable virus was detected in 10 of 14 nasopharyngeal samples (71%) that were available from the first day of laboratory testing. Follow-up samples obtained from 5 patients (Patients MSK-3, MSK-4, MSK-6, MSK-8, and MSK-9) grew virus in culture for 8, 17, 25, 26, and 61 days after the onset of symptoms (Figure 1). The 3 patients with viable virus for more than 20 days had received allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplants (2 patients) or CAR T-cell therapy (1 patient) within the previous 6 months and remained seronegative for antibodies to viral nucleoprotein; 2 of these patients had severe COVID-19 and received investigational treatments.

Whole-genome sequencing detected viral reads in all the samples and yielded more than 95% complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes for 37 of 57 nasopharyngeal samples obtained from 17 patients and all 18 cultured specimens (accession numbers, EPI_ISL_583426 to EPI_ISL_583480 [55 complete genomes]). Serial sample genomes were obtained for 11 patients, up to day 63 after the onset of symptoms. Each patient was infected by a distinct virus, and there were no major changes in the consensus sequences of the original serial specimens or cultured isolates (Figure 1B); these findings were consistent with persistent infection.

Patients with profound immunosuppression after undergoing hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation or receiving cellular therapies may shed viable SARS-CoV-2 for at least 2 months. The current guidelines for COVID-19 isolation precautions may need to be revised for immunocompromised patients.

[Prior to this series, there have been case reports of prolonged shedding and a few series addressing prolonged shedding but a number based on positive RNA without verification of live virus. One of the concerns with prolonged shedding is the possibility of the virus undergoing mutations, a concern, especially in the face of the recent variances identified. Close monitoring of individuals identified as high risk of prolonged shedding is indicated and a re-think of isolation protocols is also indicated.

- The Americas region reported 51.5% of daily case numbers and 34.2% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, but maintained its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 34.6 million cases. Costa Rica, and El Salvador, among other countries, did not report any new cases in the past 24 hours. Reported numbers still significantly decreased from pre-holiday weekend.

- The European region reported 33.1% of daily case numbers and 45.5% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 25.4 million. Countries not reporting cases include Spain, Belgium (3 cases), Switzerland, Sweden, Israel, and Kazakhstan, among others.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 4.5% of daily case numbers and 6.6% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 4.84 million cases. Iran is dominant with decreasing daily case counts now just around 5500, followed by Pakistan, Lebanon, Jordan, Morocco, Palestinian Authority, Tunisia, and Egypt. UAE and Iraq reported more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000.

- The African region reported 2.9% of daily case numbers and 3.7% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.84 million cases. South Africa maintains its dominance, reporting around 9500 new cases, followed by Nigeria, Namibia, Algeria, Uganda, Niger, Rwanda, Eswatini/Swaziland, Ghana, and Mozambique. Ethiopia, Kenya, Cameroon, Zambia, DR Congo, Botswana, Zimbabwe, among other countries, did not report any new cases.

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.3% of daily case numbers and 1.4% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 1.06 million cases. Japan is dominant, although having decreased to around 2900 cases, followed by Malaysia, Philippines, South Korea, and China.

- The South East Asia region reported 6.7% of the daily newly reported cases and 8.5% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 11.8 million cases. As previously, India remains dominant although with decreasing numbers of cases (around 20 000), followed by Indonesia (just over 6500), Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, and Nepal. Thailand reported 121 cases.

Impression: Weekend artifact has impacted reporting, especially in the Americas and European regions. In spite of that, there is a continued dominance of Europe and the Americas region representing over 84% of newly confirmed cases and 0ver 79% of newly reported deaths in the past 24 hours. The USA maintains its position as the country reporting the most cases and deaths on a daily basis, even in the face of decreased reporting over the weekend.

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (207 777), UK (41 385), India (36 405), and Russia (27 787) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 9558 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (27 Dec 2020).

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (9 countries) include the USA, UK, Russia, Spain (24 462), Brazil (22 605), India (16 072), Turkey (15 197), Germany (14 872), and Switzerland (10 087). Fewer cases are being reported from many of the countries (USA, Brazil, and Germany for example).

A total of 44 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 20 of the 44 countries that reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 10 are from the Americas region, 8 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 3 are from the South East Asia region, 2 are from the Western Pacific region, and one from the African region. Clearly related to weekend reporting artifact.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 12.6%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 10.6%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the United States show a 14.6% decrease in daily reported cases and a 13.7% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: While the global daily reported cases continue to increase with over 500 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours (a lower number of cases reported due to the holiday/weekend effect). Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts even with reductions in daily case reports due to the holiday weekend, followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, South East Asia, and Western Pacific regions. - Mod.MPP]
