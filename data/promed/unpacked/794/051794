It appears that an outbreak of dengue fever in this northern province is likely this year [2012]. Since the beginning of the year [2012], Chiang Mai has seen more than a hundred cases of dengue fever.

Dr Wattana Karnjanakamol, the doctor of the Public Health Center of Chiang Mai, made public that as the period from June to September is the rainy season, greater caution must be exercised against the fever. Furthermore, the cycle of dengue fever outbreaks comes every other year with the virus becoming more virulent each year.

Citizens are asked to cooperate in destroying breeding grounds for the carrier of the virus, mosquitoes.
