Cucumber prices tumbled last week despite drought conditions and an
ongoing water shortage. Upset farmers complained that many of their
crops were ruined by a dreaded cucumber disease, and they were not
able to bring much of the cukes to market. Demand rocketed past
supply. Farmers planted a larger than usual crop to offset the
disease and ended up with surplus in the market.

[A large number of pathogens can affect cucurbit crops, which include
cucumber, melons, squash and pumpkin. We would be grateful for
further information on this outbreak in Trinidad.
