Two people were diagnosed with a bacterial disease named leptospirosis on Friday [8 Jul 2022] after visiting rivers in the north, the Health Ministry reported. Three people have died [sic; see item 2 and moderator's commentary at the bottom] this year [2022] from leptospirosis that they caught in water sources in the north.

Earlier this week, the Health Ministry and the Environmental Protection Ministry warned the public that water sample testing from some of the rivers in the north had turned up concerning results and that entering those waters could be dangerous.

Two clinical cases of leptospirosis have been detected. Following an epidemiological investigation, it has been revealed that both patients had visited swimming sites in northern Israel: one at Nahal Zaki (Golan) in early June [2022] and the other one at the Sahne [Gan Hashlosha National Park].

Since the beginning of 2022, a total of 3 leptospirosis cases have been found related to exposure to water sources in the north of the country.

On 5 Jul 2022, the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Environmental Protection reported abnormal test results in water samples collected on 4 Jul 2022 to examine the state of pollution in certain streams in the north of the country, and therefore informed hikers and local authorities that entering these streams could be dangerous. The results, found in a number of streams in the north, exceed the recommendations of the Ministry of Health (400 fecal colliforms per 100 ml) -- a result that indicates the presence of contamination in the water. The Ministry of Environmental Protection has not found a known source of the pollution. In light of these results, entry into the following streams may be dangerous until the results of following samples are normal and stable [For the names/locations of the addressed streams, please refer to the source URL]. The Ministries of Health and of Environmental Protection are continuing their sampling and follow-up, and will update the list and directions continuously.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Eliana Aaron for this submission. Dr Eliana Aaron writes: "Two people traveling in northern Israel were diagnosed with leptospirosis. Leptospirosis is not uncommon in freshwater rivers and lakes in North Galilee, particularly in the summer. The Ministry of Health has increased water testing of affected areas and issued warnings to avoid contaminated rivers and streams."

ProMED Mod.AS (Dr. Arnon Shimshony) writes: "The news in Jerusalem Post about fatalities 'have been greatly exaggerated'. There are no fatalities. See https://www.inn.co.il/news/570810, https://news.walla.co.il/item/3517113 and https://www.israelhayom.co.il/news/environment/article/12116056. From the [Israel Ministry of Health] reports, it is not clear if the pathogen [_Leptospira_species] was detected in the relevant water bodies in northern Israel, or whether the evidence about the source of infections is circumstantial, based on the history of the patients' visits to the named sites. Gan Hashlosha National Park, including warm spring water pools, is a nationally popular recreation site; map at https://tinyurl.com/mry48z9u. Israel's National Environmental Health System publishes frequent announcements on abnormal test results of recreational water bodies at https://www.gov.il/he/departments/news/05072022-02."

In the summer of 2018, leptospirosis broke out in cattle herds grazing in the southern Golan Heights. At the same time, leptospirosis was noted to have affected over 500 people who boated and swam in the streams of the Golan in 2018, compared to 10 cases in 2017, 7 in 2016, and 7 in 2015 (ProMED posts Leptospirosis - Israel (02): (HZ) cattle, vaccination, control 20190609.6511457 and Leptospirosis - Israel: (HZ) environment, susp. 20190607.6508897). Leptospirosis was also reported in dogs that entered the streams in the area (ProMED post Leptospirosis - Israel (04): (HZ) recreation, streams, animal reservoir 20180818.5973544). Serological tests in animals and humans indicated _Leptospira interrogans_ serovar _Pomona_ being the most likely pathogen, a serovar adapted to pigs, which can develop chronic renal infection, chronically excreting _Leptospira_ in the urine. Among wild boars hunted on the Golan Heights, the sero-positivity rate was reported to exceed 30%.

The positive-reacting herds were treated with appropriate antibiotics and the owners were instructed to vaccinate their cattle. However, ProMED Mod.AS pointed out that vaccination may fail to stop bacterial excretion in already-infected animals and infected wild boar would not be affected by these preventive measures. Also see ProMED post Leptospirosis - Israel (04): (HZ) recreation, streams, animal reservoir 20180818.5973544. Predictably, in 2019 and now in the summer of 2022, streams on the Golan Heights are thought to be contaminated with _Leptospira_, associated this year with 3 human cases of leptospirosis.

Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that is distributed worldwide. Leptospirosis is transmitted to humans by direct contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes with the urine of infected animals or by contact with wet soil, vegetation, or fresh (not salty) water that has been contaminated by urine of animals chronically infected with one of the several hundred serovars of the spirochete _Leptospira_. Rodents, dogs, cattle, and pigs are the usual reservoirs for this organism. These animals, which are mostly asymptomatic but chronically infected, excrete _Leptospira_ in their urine; leptospiruria persists for long periods or for life, and _Leptospira_ bacteria shed in urine may survive in fresh water or moist soil for weeks to months. Multiple serovars may be endemic in a given geographic area. Protective immunity against _Leptospira_ infection is predominantly serovar-specific.

Leptospirosis is an occupational hazard for people who work outdoors or with animals; for example, workers in wet agricultural settings (such as rice field workers), ranchers, slaughterhouse workers, trappers, loggers, sewer workers, veterinarians, fishery workers, dairy farmers, or military personnel. Leptospirosis is also a risk from household exposure to infected pet animals or rodents.

Leptospirosis is a risk during recreational activities such as camping, freshwater swimming, canoeing, kayaking, rafting, golfing, and trail biking that involve exposure to water in lakes, rivers, or ponds contaminated by urine from _Leptospira_-infected animals. Inadequate disposal of trash and debris provides a suitable habitat for infected rat infestation in urban settings. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers.

The diagnosis of leptospirosis requires confirmation by MAT (microscopic agglutination test) serology, but an IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), IgM dipstick, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have been used to confirm the diagnosis (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3939550/). Dr. Jan Clement has cautioned (see ProMED post Leptospirosis - Australia (03): (QL) comment 20210525.8380596) that Seoul hantavirus infection, also transmitted by rats, may be misdiagnosed as leptospirosis because its clinical manifestations mimic those of leptospirosis.

Treatment with antibiotics (penicillin and doxycycline) can be effective, especially if started early in the disease. Doxycycline (200 mg orally, once weekly) has been shown to be effective as short-term prophylaxis in high-risk environments (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM198402233100805) for those exposed to contaminated floodwater or soil (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2018/infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/leptospirosis). Each 200-mg dose provides a benefit for up to 7 days, so the dose may be repeated if high-risk conditions persist longer than this.

Although vaccines are available for immunizing non-human animals against some serovars of _Leptospira_ and are available in some countries for humans, no vaccine against leptospirosis is available for use in humans in the United States.

The Northern District (Hazafon) is one of Israel's 6 administrative districts; the Golan Heights is a sub-district of the Northern District, which has several hiking paths through streams and pools that attract many travelers.
