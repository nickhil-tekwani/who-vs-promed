Nunavut's chief public health officer has declared a tuberculosis outbreak in a Baffin Island community [Pangnirtung]. Dr Michael Patterson says there has recently been an increase in cases in Pangnirtung, where about 1500 people live. [see Department of Health, Public Health Advisory, Tuberculosis Outbreak in Pangnirtung https://www.gov.nu.ca/health/news/tuberculosis-outbreak-pangnirtung.]

Patterson says an outbreak is declared when health workers can no longer find links between active cases.

He says people who have been exposed to tuberculosis or who have symptoms, including a persistent cough, lost appetite, or fever, should go to a health centre immediately.

Historically, Nunavut has had the highest rate of tuberculosis in the country, and every community in the territory screens for the disease. The Liberal government has promised to eliminate TB in Nunavut by 2030. [https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/tuberculosis-philpott-obed-fight-1.4589028]

[Nunavut, the largest federal territory of Canada, is the size of Western Europe but is not connected to the rest of North America by highway (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nunavut). Nunavut is the least populous of Canada's provinces and territories, with an estimated population in 2021 of about 40 000, mostly Inuit people (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nunavut). The territorial capital, Iqaluit, with a population in 2016 of about 7700, is located on Baffin Island, which had a population of about 13 000 in 2016.

The TB outbreak reported in the news article above is occurring in Pangnirtung (pop., about 1500 in 2016), an Inuit hamlet on Baffin Island, which has achieved an international reputation for its traditional arts in sculpture, printmaking, and weaving (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangnirtung). Pangnirtung, with no road access, is reachable by plane. Basic medical services are available at the local health centre, with advanced care available via medevac to Iqaluit (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangnirtung).

Aboriginal peoples in Canada comprise the Inuit, First Nations, and Metis (indigenous First People of Canada who trace their descent to mixed European and First Nations parentage) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboriginal_peoples_in_Canada). First Nations, Inuit, and MÃ©tis make up only 5 per cent of the Canadian population, but according to public health officials, they accounted for almost 20 per cent of reported cases of active tuberculosis in 2016 (https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/tuberculosis-philpott-obed-fight-1.4589028).

The highest rate of active TB in Canada is reported among the Inuit, with an incidence of 198.3/100 000 in 2014, a rate over 300 times that of the Canadian-born, non-Indigenous population (http://healthycanadians.gc.ca/publications/diseases-conditions-maladies-affections/tuberculosis-2014-tuberculose/index-eng.php#a1). Similar TB incidence rates among the Inuit were reported in 2015 (166.2 per 100 000 people) (https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/phac-aspc/migration/phac-aspc/publicat/ccdr-rmtc/17vol43/dr-rm43-3-4/assets/pdf/17vol43_3_4-eng.pdf) and 2016 (170.1 per 100 000) (https://cps.ca/documents/position/tuberculosis-among-first-nations-inuit-and-metis-children-and-youth).

Overcrowded housing, poor nutrition, food insecurity, inaccessible communities, and health inequities are some of the underlying factors that have been cited that influence the persistently high incidence of TB among the Inuit (https://sigma.nursingrepository.org/bitstream/handle/10755/303959/Carbonu_TuberculosisinNunavut.pdf).

Little information is given in the news report above or in the government advisory about this TB outbreak in Pangnirtung. For example, the government has not said how many cases have been detected over what period of time, and has not characterized cases, for example, as to age, underlying diseases, or exposures in common. More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.
