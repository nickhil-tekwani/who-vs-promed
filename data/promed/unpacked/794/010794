[1] Uganda, Rakai, prevention measures in cattle

http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Four-Rakai-cattle-markets-closed-over-fever-outbreak/688334-4704338-ov0qubz/index.html


Rakai veterinary specialists and leaders have closed 4 major cattle markets in the district following an outbreak of Rift Valley Fever (RVF) in neighbouring Isingiro district. Two people and 7 cows have already died of the fever. The closed markets include Ddyango and Kamuli in Kyalulangira and Kiziba sub-counties, respectively. Others are Kacheera and Lwamagwa livestock markets.

Livestock farmers in Kyalulangira, under their umbrella body Nyekundire Farmers' Association, say the district authorities had been reluctant to close the markets in the past month over revenue.

"We have been telling them to close the markets, but they were looking at revenue likely to be lost. People's health is more important than the targeted revenue from cattle traders. Even the foot and mouth disease could have been contained a long time ago if those people [district authorities] were vigilant," Mr Robert Kanyete, the association chairperson, said in an interview on Tuesday [7 Aug 2018].

The district veterinary officer, Mr Erias Kizito Nsubuga, said the closure of the markets followed a directive from the anti-stock safety unit to control the spread. "RVF has not yet extended to Rakai, but we closed the markets to prevent it from spreading to our district since traders buy cattle from different farms, including those in Isingiro," Dr Nsubuga said.

He added that they also temporarily imposed a ban on the slaughter of cattle and sale of dairy products such as milk as they monitor the situation. He said the fever will not spread to the district due to their robust surveillance system. "We have capacity in responding to outbreaks, and we have proved that over the years," he said. Livestock farmers have suffered unending outbreaks of FMD since 2015, prompting government to place them under quarantine.

According to World Health Organisation (WHO), [RVF] can be transmitted to people either by tick bites or contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter.

[2] Kenya, spread to Kilifi's cattle

The county government of Kilifi has issued a quarantine against the movement of livestock in Magarini and Malindi sub-counties following cases of Rift Valley fever [RVF]. County executive committee member for agriculture, livestock, and fisheries Luciana Sanzua confirmed on Wednesday [8 Aug 2018] that 16 goats and 2 cattle have died of RVF.

Speaking at the governor's office, Sanzua also confirmed that 17 abattoirs and 4 slaughter slabs have been shut down in the 2 sub-counties. "There were reported cases of abortions in animals in 2 private farms and 2 homesteads in the 2 sub-counties. Abortions in animals is the main clinical sign of RVF in animals; thus, these were handled as suspected cases. Blood samples were taken from the animals and submitted to the Central Veterinary Laboratory-Kabete-Nairobi. This was on [Thu 12 Jul 2018]. We received the results on [Mon 30 Jul 2018]; 18 out of the 78 samples turned positive," said Sanzua. She said the spread was a result of the heavy rains and subsequent flooding in the 2 sub-counties.

The department has since embarked on the spraying of animals with acaricide (chemical), which kills the type of mosquito that breeds in flooded areas and is the type responsible for incubation and starting off of the chain of transmission. "We imposed the quarantine last week to avoid the spread of the disease to other areas. We have also restricted the movement of livestock from Tana River and Garissa counties to our county. Our surveillance team is on the ground, and we urge members of the public to avoid red meat for the time being," added Sanzua. The department of health has also closed down butcheries in the 2 sub-counties.

On Wednesday [8 Aug 2018], health county executive committee member Anisa Omar said no cases of human infection have been reported in the county. She said all health workers have been put on a 24-hour surveillance. "All our medical officers in our health facilities have been instructed to screen anyone who may present with symptoms of RVF. We also urge members of the public to sleep in mosquito-treated nets to keep off the vector," she said.

According to WHO, there is some evidence that humans may become infected with RVF by ingesting the unpasteurized or uncooked milk of infected animals. The majority of human infections result from direct or indirect contact with the blood or organs of infected animals. The virus can be transmitted to humans through the handling of animal tissue during slaughtering or butchering, assisting with animal births, conducting veterinary procedures, or from the disposal of carcasses or foetuses. Certain occupational groups, such as herders, farmers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians, are therefore at higher risk of infection.

The virus infects humans through inoculation, for example via a wound from an infected knife or through contact with broken skin, or through inhalation of aerosols produced during the slaughter of infected animals.

[This is the 1st notification of RVF from Kenya's coastal Kilifi County, situated south of the RVF-infected Tana River County, in south east Kenya.

Kilifi was one of the 20 counties advised during the 2nd week of June 2018 [week of 11 Jun 2018], shortly after the initial detection of human RVF cases in Kenya, "to immediately commence animal vaccination and vector control." The other 19 were Uasin Gishu, Trans Nzoia, Nakuru, Laikipia, Kajiado, Baringo, Wajir, Garissa, Marsabit, Meru, Machakos, Taita Taveta, Tana River, Mombasa, Kwale, Nyeri, Tharaka Nithi, Murang'a, and Kiambu (see 4th item in archive no. 20180615.5858590).

The total number of reported RVF outbreaks in Kenya's animals since the start of the event (3 Jun 2018) is 10, according to the 6 official reports submitted so far to the OIE. The most recent follow-up report was submitted on Mon 6 Aug 2018, informing the absence of new outbreaks (since 2 Jul 2018). The outbreaks were reported from the following counties (number of outbreaks in brackets): Mandera (1), Wajir (2), Marsabit (1), Isiolo (2), Meru (1), Baringo (1), Tara River (1), and Siaya (1). Links to all reports and a map presenting their locations are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=26827.

According to recent media reports, the counties of Kajiado and, currently, Kilifi should be added to the list of counties in which RVF has been recorded in animals. For Kenya's counties map, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counties_of_Kenya.

The 1st OIE notification of RVF from another Eastern African country, namely Rwanda, is being published separately (see Rift Valley fever - Eastern Africa (26): Rwanda, bovine, OIE 20180811.5959586). - Mod.AS
