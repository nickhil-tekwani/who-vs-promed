Juan Manzur, Minister of Health of the Nation, confirmed that "there is no viral circulation of the disease in Argentina" but did say that the 1st case came from a patient who "entered the country with the virus from the United States."

10 days ago, the Carmen de Areco hospital closed its doors due to a rare virus that affected 10 employees and patients. After the fact, the Ministry of Health released the results of studies done to those affected.

They said that they had "detected the presence of influenza A viral genome in 4 samples of patients affected by the outbreak of severe pneumonia in the hospital."

"This clearly reveals the importance of being vaccinated against the flu because influenza is a potentially serious illness for people within the risk groups, as in the case of health care workers" said Manzur.

He added "the 1st case of those that occurred in the Carmen de Areco [hospital] correspond to a patient who entered the country with the virus from the United States and spread to people that he had contact with in the intensive care unit of the hospital. "

A 2nd nurse infected with swine flu has died. A nurse who had become infected with swine flu in a Carmen de Areco hospital died in La Plata after being hospitalized for 20 days.

The woman worked as a nursing auxiliary at the Nuestra Senora del Carmen hospital, in Carmen de Areco, where the virus had affected another 11 people.

This is the 2nd fatal case registered in the region. On 8 Feb 2013 the head nurse in the hospital's ICU department, 39-year-old [woman], also died after becoming infected with swine flu. She was also being treated in La Plata.

The Ministry of Health in Buenos Aires confirmed that the 2 nurses in Carmen de Areco Hospital did not die because of influenza A as it was initially stated by the National Government. They died because of an infection caused by a microorganism detected in water tanks and pipes in the hospital, and it was announced that the investigation will continue because "it is the 1st outbreak reported in this country with such characteristics."

Meanwhile, a sister of one of the victims complained that the information was deliberately hidden, while the union of health care workers in Buenos Aires (CICOP, according to its Spanish initials) declared that the hospital is functioning in "non-sanitary" conditions.

Dr. Luis Crovetto, Director of Primary Care and Preventive Medicine in the Ministry of Health, pointed out that "the conclusions of epidemiological analyses -- including the autopsies carried out on the fatal victims -- revealed that they died because of a nosocomial infection outbreak produced by _Legionella_, a microorganism that may have been living in the water supply." The officer also warned that "this is the 1st outbreak occurring in this country with such characteristics'; and for this reason, they will continue investigating this situation in order to learn more about the microorganism that ultimately killed [the 2 nurses]. This outbreak also was responsible for 9 persons who became sick and had to be hospitalized.

Knowing these recent facts, Dr. Crovetto declared that "we will replace the pipes and tanks in the hospital in order to guarantee biological safety for our personnel and our patients," after the presence of _Legionella_ in the water pipes of the health care facility was revealed. The information was communicated last Monday to the victims' relatives, but this was made public yesterday after a formal complaint from CICOP, in which they mentioned "the disastrous management" and "deep neglect" in provincial hospitals.

Meanwhile, Carmen de Areco local authority, Mr. Marcelo Skansi, declared that "we wanted to get to the truth and even if it took some time because of the use of scientific techniques (sic), now we know what really happened. Now we need to know how this microorganism got here and we are expecting the arrival of Dr. Collia (Ministry of health) in order to reopen our beloved hospital."

The local authority praised the performance of the former hospital authorities, who have been removed (because of this occurrence), pointing out that "they were fully dedicated to this issue. As soon as an infection was declared, they acted in the right way, since even if the diagnosis took a long time, they prescribed proper medications and this is a proof that they did well."

On the other hand, the sister of one of the deceased nurses, declared that now that there are so many different versions about the possible causes of the aforementioned infection "we do not know what to believe and what to disbelieve in;" and she also said that "nobody apologized after they blamed (at the beginning of this ordeal) my sister for bringing influenza A from the United States."

On the other hand, Mr. Guillermo Pacagnini, from CICOP, declared that "the Ministry of Health lied about the presence of influenza A in Carmen de Areco Hospital." He said in an interview to QM News Channel "the conditions of this hospital are non-sanitary," and this is something occurring "throughout this province. They wanted to do a cover-up with this influenza A issue so that there would be no more complaints about the poor sanitary conditions of this hospital," he added.

[The 3 news reports above concern an outbreak of an acute respiratory infection that occurred at a hospital in Carmen de Areco, Argentina, which was closed in late January 2013 because of this outbreak. The number of outbreak cases varies from 10 in the initial report on 2 Feb 2013, to 12 in the 2nd report on 22 Feb 2013, and to 11 in the 3rd report on 23 Mar 2013. 2 hospital employees were involved; both were nurses, one of whom worked in the ICU. Both nurses died and their autopsies confirmed they both died of Legionnaires' disease, which the latest report says was also responsible for illness in 9 other patients. However, the 1st report says that "the presence of influenza A viral genome" was detected "in 4 samples of patients" involved in the outbreak; we are not told specifically the number of patients these samples represent or if any of these samples were from the 2 nurses. We are also told that _Legionella_ has been detected in the hospital plumbing system, but are not told if the species of _Legionella_ detected in the plumbing system or its genotype matches that found in any of the patients.

Legionellosis is an infectious disease caused usually by inhalation of aerosols containing _Legionella_ species. Legionnaires' disease is the acute pneumonic form of legionellosis; more than 70 percent of cases of Legionnaires' disease are due to _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1, except in Australia and New Zealand, where _L. pneumophila_ serogroup one has accounted for only 45.7 percent of cases of community-acquired legionellosis, and _Legionella longbeachae_ has accounted for 30.4 percent of cases (Yu VL, et al: Distribution of _Legionella_ species and serogroups isolated by culture in patients with sporadic community-acquired legionellosis: An international collaborative survey. J Infect Dis. 2002; 186(1): 127-8. Available at: http://www.legionella.org/lp_distribution.pdf). Legionnaires' disease due to _L. longbeachae_ has been associated with the use of potting soil and gardening.

Legionnaires' disease attacks more frequently and is more severe in individuals who are elderly, smokers, alcoholics, or who have an underlying illness such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or who have a weakened immune system as a result of, for example, organ transplant or taking immunosuppressive drugs (such as, corticosteroid therapy) for other reasons. However, it is important to emphasize that relatively healthy individuals can also be at risk of contracting this disease.

A diagnosis of even a single case of Legionnaires' disease implies the presence of an environmental source to which other susceptible individuals are likely to have been exposed. It is, therefore, a public health imperative to find that source to prevent further cases.

Genotyping of patient and environmental isolates has become a helpful tool to establish transmission pathways. The predominance of one genotype of _Legionella_ isolated from patient specimens would suggest transmission from a common source. Because _Legionella_ may be found in environmental samples without linkage to any cases of legionellosis, the actual causative infectious reservoir can be confirmed by matching the genotype of clinical and environmental isolates (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC86783/ and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730281/).

However, this is difficult in legionellosis outbreaks, because, frequently, the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease is made only on the basis of urinary _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 antigen testing or serology rather than isolation of the organism from cultures of respiratory tract specimens. Consequently, clinical isolates are often not available for genotyping.

For a description of an extensive investigation of a nosocomial outbreak, please see the CDC report of on the outbreak of Legionnaires' disease at the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Veterans Hospital posted by ProMED-mail recently (Legionellosis - USA: (PA) nosocomial, CDC investigation 20130226.1560035).
