The Kyrgyz authorities would punish "those responsible" for
distributing FMD
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prime Minister of Kyrgyzstan Omurbek Babanov ordered that urgent
measures be taken to combat the epidemic of FMD in the country, as
well as to punish those who caused the spread of the disease, a
representative of the Kyrgyzi government press service told RIA
Novosti on Friday [11 Nov 2011].

Foot and mouth disease [FMD] is a fatal infectious disease affecting
livestock and wild ungulates. According to the Ministry of Agriculture
of Kyrgyzstan, to date, infections have been reported in 62 locations
across the country, with 6000 head of cattle affected.

"The outbreak of FMD began in Kyrgyzstan in mid-September [2011], and
within 2 months it spread to several regions of the country. Despite
the action taken in October, a new strain of the pathogen was
recorded, namely 'A-Iran-5,' against which the applied vaccine does
not provide protection," he said.

According to him, Babanov instructed the Ministry of Agriculture to
take "the strictest measures against those persons responsible for the
FMD outbreak" and to provide the needed veterinary services and
manpower to all AO (local authorities in Kyrgyzstan).

According to the Ministry of Agriculture, about 2.5 million head of
cattle have been vaccinated this year against FMD in Kyrgyzstan. To
tackle the problem, funds have been diverted from other subjects such
as the prevention of sheep and goat pox.

In Kyrgyzstan, an outbreak of foot and mouth disease
----------------------------------------------------
Questions of the epizootic situation in Kyrgyzstan were discussed at a
meeting in the government of the republic with the Acting Prime
Minister Omurbek Babanov, reports Kazinform.

The meeting heard information from the minister of agriculture
Torogula Bekov, General Director of State Veterinary Ministry of
Agriculture Zhanybek Sultanov. According to the minister of
agriculture, the FMD outbreak began 13 Sep 2011 in a village of the
Ak-Bashat Jaiyl area. At present, FMD is registered in cattle in vast
areas in Chui (Chuy), Issyk-Kul (Ysyk-Kol), Naryn and Jalal-Abad
regions.

During the last 10 months, vaccinations were applied in 2 313 634 head
of cattle, 1 239 800 sheep and goats and 1 073 800 goats.

However, despite the measures taken, in October the disease reemerged,
the causative agent being FMD virus type "A-Iran-5" which had not been
previously registered in the republic. Accordingly, no vaccine against
this type was purchased.

As a result of discussions, Omurbek Babanov instructed the Ministry of
Agriculture to take the strictest measures against those responsible
for the outbreak. In addition, he requested to contact relevant
research institutes for the purchase of vaccines against the
identified type of agent, and in general to develop a set of measures
for the prevention and control of communicable diseases in the
country.

"It is necessary to carry out systematic work on prevention and
control of various diseases in animals, and not to act every time only
after the start of an outbreak. All senior officials of the Veterinary
Services who have not acted to prevent the FMD infection, should
suffer severe punishment," summarized O. Babanov.

[The last FMD outbreaks reported by Kyrgyzstan to the OIE date back to
May-July 2007, affecting cattle with serotypes A and O in the
provinces Batken and Chuy; the disease was, reportedly, continuing
during the 2nd semester of 2007 and the 1st semester of 2008. Since
mid-2007, no periodic reports from Kyrgyzstan have been submitted to
the OIE, though semiannual and annual reports are required from all
member counties.

In February 2010, press reports described an outbreak in the Naryn
province, apparently addressed by the veterinary service. No report
was submitted to the OIE and ProMED-mail's RFI received no response.

Such a lacune in epidemiological information from a central-Asian
country is a cause for concern to its neighbours and beyond. In a
world declared free of rinderpest, regular and reliable reporting has
become even more vital. - Mod.AS]
