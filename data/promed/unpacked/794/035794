The cholera epidemic has once again hit northern Uganda's Yumbe
District, killing 5 people; and 65 cases have been registered,
according to the District Health Officer Alfred Yayi.

Meanwhile, the cholera has now spread to 10 sub-counties infecting
331 people in northwestern Uganda's Nebbi District while the death
toll has remained at 4. The number of cases rose from 17 cases to 65
over the weekend, said Yayi, who was quoted by Daily Monitor on
Wednesday [12 Dec 2007]. Yayi said that the worst-hit areas are Yoyo
and Locogmbo parishes in Kuru and Romogi sub-counties respectively.
He said the areas still lack clean water and proper sanitary facilities.

It is the 3rd time the scourge has hit the Nebbi district since the
beginning of 2007, increasing the disease burden on the already
resource-constrained district.

The cholera epidemic has spread to 10 sub-counties infecting 331
people in Nebbi District. The District Surveillance Officer, Mr.
Benjamin Wanichan told reporters on Tuesday [11 Dec 2007] that 30
more cases were recorded. The total number of cases has risen from
301 to 331 within a week. Mr. Wanichan said new cases were reported
in the areas of Paidha, Kucwiny, Nyaravur and Erussi.

Mr. Wanichan attributed the disease escalation to contamination of
water sources. He noted that the task force and meetings with
sub-county leaders have been organized in order to step up
sensitisation on hygiene and sanitation.

[3] Cholera, diarrhea - Zimbabwe: (Harare)
Date: Tue 11 Dec 2007

CHRA (Combined Harare Residents Association) has received an
increasing number of reports on diarrhea and cholera cases from
Mabvuku and Tafara in the last 2 weeks. Residents complain that while
in some parts of Mabvuku and Tafara there has been a steady supply of
water, it is almost always dirty and has a suspicious smell. On
Monday [10 Dec 2007] a CHRA team visited Mabvuku and Tafara and
interviewed medical personnel in private and public clinics. It has
emerged that hundreds of people are suffering from stomach problems
which medical personnel liken to cholera and dysentery.

A survey made by CHRA through its structures also revealed that most
people cannot afford medical attention and resort to traditional
means. The survey also revealed that a lot of people have been hit by
the stomach ailments. The problems of disease outbreaks come after
residents in Mabvuku and Tafara have been hit by serious water
shortages resulting in most households fetching water from streams.
As for the few who have water from their taps, the water is dirty and
has visible algae.

The Zimbabwe National Water Authority (ZINWA) took over the
administration of sewer and water services from the City of Harare.
The takeover led to a downward trend in the quality of services
offered by the City of Harare. Sadly, ZINWA has failed to provide
adequate water supplies for business and household use in Harare. The
City of Harare has over 60 percent of water in its water bodies but
ZINWA has no capacity to treat adequate supplies for residential and
industrial use.

[Mabvuku (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mabvuku>) is a high density
suburb some 17 km [10.5 miles] east of Harare, the capital city of
Zimbabwe. Its classified as a suburb or township of Harare, with
Harare City Council constituting local government. It encompasses in
particular the townships that include Old Mabvuku and New Mabvuku,
and more generally Old Tafara, and New Tafara (the latter 2
constituting Tafara properly speaking).

A total of 2 people have died as a result of a fresh cholera outbreak
in southeastern Burundi, officials said Monday [10 Dec 2007].

"2 people died of cholera yesterday (9 Dec 2007) and another 57
people were hospitalized in the Nyanza-Lake health centre," 130
kilometers (80 miles) from Bujumbura, local official Epimene Batsinda
told AFP. He said that at least 152 people had been infected by the
disease since the outbreak was first reported on 1 Dec 2007.

Batsinda said that Nyanza-Lake town was prone to such epidemics since
the only form of sanitation and drinking water available to most of
its 54 000 residents is Lake Tanganyika.

[5] Cholera - Tanzania: (Dar es Salaam)

At least 3 people are admitted to Buguruni Cholera Care Centre in Dar
es Salaam. Dar es Salaam Regional Commissioner Abbas Kandoro said
this on Wednesday [5 Dec 2007] when officiating at a regional
consultative meeting held at Temeke in the city.

He said among 37 patients who reported at Temeke hospital between 3
Oct 2007 and 1 Nov 2007, 3 were suffering from cholera. The rest of
the patients were found to be suffering from diarrhea. All of them
had since been treated and discharged.

He said since cholera had broken out again in the city people had to
ensure cleanliness of their environment including building better toilets.

Kandoro said it was a shame for a city such as Dar es Salaam to be
ravaged by cholera because the municipalities were putting a lot of
effort to ensure cleanliness. He said most cholera patients came from
Temeke municipality.

[6] Cholera - India: (Orissa) ex Bangladesh

As India grapples with cross-border militant movement from
Bangladesh, Indian scientists have detected another foe from that
country, a virulent cholera strain that recently killed nearly 150
people in Orissa.

Scientists at the Regional Medical Research Centre (RMRC) here, a
body under the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), have found
a hybrid strain, new to Orissa, in many cholera patients in the
tribal belt of Rayagada, Koraput and Kalahandi.

"2 cholera organisms - El Tor and Classical, were generally found in
Orissa and the new organism is a hybrid. The new strain is virulent
and is behind the death of many people in the state," said S.K. Kar,
director of RMRC, Bhubaneswar.

"Our initial research has found the root of the strain as Bangladesh.
A lot of Bangladeshi laborers working in the industrial units and
mines of the area are the carriers of this organism. Scientists have
found the hybrid strain 1st in Africa and then in Bangladesh. Of the
total cases studied so far, 56 percent of them have been infected by
this virulent strain. It must have come with Bangladeshi laborers and
spread through water and other means," Kar told IANS.

[Whether these hybrid strains originated in neighboring Bangladesh is
not entirely clear but the strain is certainly noteworthy.

What is likely being referred to are the variants of _V. cholerae_ O1
biotype El Tor that have some characteristics of the Classical
biotype. Described by Nair, et al (1) from the International Centre
for Diarrhoeal Research in Bangladesh, the strains were obtained from
patients with cholera from the Matlab Hospital and they are often
referred to as the Matlab variants.

Formally, the 2 established biotypes can be distinguished from one
another by a number of properties including hemolysis of sheep red
blood cells, agglutination of chicken red blood cells, the
Voges-Proskauer reaction as well as susceptibility to polymyxin B and
to biotype-specific viral bacteriophages. Nair, et al, described 3
Matlab types based on the hybrids of these phenotypic traits. A
hybrid strain has also been found in Mozambique (2) which had genetic
relatedness to the Matlab strains (3). Importantly, the Matlab
variants have been shown to have all the necessary genes to initiate
a pandemic (3).
