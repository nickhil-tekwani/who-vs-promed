2005 West Nile virus activity in the United States (reported to CDC as of 6
Dec 2005)*
--------------------------------------------------
*Currently, West Nile virus (WNV) maps are updated weekly to reflect
surveillance reports released by state and local health departments to
CDC's ArboNET system for public distribution.
As of 6 Dec 2005, avian, animal or mosquito WNV infections have been
reported to CDC ArboNET from the following states: Alabama, Arizona,
Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of
Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas,
Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota,
Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New
Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma,
Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota,
Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia,
Wisconsin, and Wyoming. [a total of 48 states and one special district,
that is DC]
Human cases have been reported in: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California,
Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois,
Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New
Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma,
Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota,
Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. [a total of 42 states]
Maps detailing county-level human, mosquito, veterinary, avian and sentinel
data are published each week on the collaborative USGS/CDC West Nile virus
website: <http://westnilemaps.usgs.gov/>

* Cases with neurologic manifestations (such as WN meningitis, WN
encephalitis, WN myelitis)
** Cases with no evidence of neuroinvasion
*** Illnesses for which insufficient clinical information was provided
**** Total number of human cases of WNV illness reported to ArboNET by
state and local health departments.
Neuroinvasive disease refers to severe disease cases, particularly West
Nile meningitis and West Nile encephalitis.
West Nile fever refers to typically less severe cases that show no evidence
of neuroinvasion.
West Nile fever is not currently on the list of nationally notifiable
diseases, and therefore it is optional whether or not state health
departments report these cases to CDC [further explanations of
neuroinvasive West Nile virus disease and West Nile fever are available at
the URL above].
"Other clinical" includes persons with clinical manifestations other than
WN fever, WN encephalitis, or WN meningitis, such as acute flaccid
paralysis. Unspecified cases are those for which sufficient clinical
information was not provided.
Total human cases reported to CDC: these numbers reflect both mild and
severe human disease cases occurring between 1 Jan 2005 through 6 Dec 2005
that have been reported to ArboNet by state and local health departments.
ArboNet is the national, electronic surveillance system established by CDC
to assist states in tracking West Nile virus and other mosquitoborne
viruses. Information regarding 2005 virus/disease activity is posted when
such cases are reported to CDC.
Of the 2775 cases, 1159 (42 per cent) were reported as West Nile meningitis
or encephalitis (neuroinvasive disease), 1455 (52 per cent) were reported
as West Nile fever (milder disease), and 161 (6 per cent) were clinically
unspecified at this time. Please refer to state health department web sites
for further details regarding state case totals.
Note: The high proportion of neuroinvasive disease cases among reported
cases of West Nile virus disease reflects surveillance reporting bias.
Serious cases are more likely to be reported than mild cases. Also, the
surveillance system is not designed to detect asymptomatic infections. Data
from population-based surveys indicate that, among all people who become
infected with West Nile virus (including people with asymptomatic
infections), less than one per cent will develop severe neuroinvasive
disease. See: Mostashari F, Bunning ML, Kitsutani PT, et al. Epidemic West
Nile encephalitis, New York, 1999: results of a household-based
seroepidemiological survey. Lancet 2001; 358: 261-4.

[As of 6-12 Nov 2005, wk 45, the WNV season for Canada was officially
announced to be over. For the USA, due to its generally warmer location, a
small number of new cases of WNV infection in humans are still occurring in
a handful of states. - Mod.RY]
