A 5-year-old Indonesian girl from Central Java province has died of
bird flu, a Health Ministry official said on Wednesday [23 May 2007].
The girl from Wonogiri, who had fallen ill on 8 May 2007, died last
Thursday [17 May 2007] after being treated in hospital in the town of
Solo for fever and respiratory problems, said Suharda Ningrum of the
ministry's bird flu centre.
The authorities are still investigating the case, but at least 20
chickens had died suddenly near her home, the official said. Contact
with sick fowl is the most common cause of human infection. The
girl's death brings the number of confirmed human fatalities in
Indonesia to 77, the highest in the world. Millions of backyard fowl
live in close proximity to humans, and keeping backyard chickens is
ingrained in Indonesian culture. The authorities in some areas have
made efforts to alter this behavior, but health education campaigns
have often been patchy and rules difficult to enforce.
Scientists fear the virus could mutate into a strain that spreads
easily among people, triggering a pandemic that would sweep the globe.

Viet Nam confirmed on Wednesday its 1st human bird flu case in more
than a year, as the virus continues to spread through the country's
poultry stocks. A 30-year-old man from northern Vinh Phuc province
remains in a critical condition after testing positive for the H5N1
virus 3 days ago [20 May 2007], said Tran Quy, director of Bach Mai
hospital in Hanoi.

A 30-year-old man under treatment at Bach Mai Hospital in Hanoi,
might be the 1st human case of bird flu infection in Viet Nam since
November 2005, local media reported on Wed 23 May 2007. Initial tests
on samples taken from him were positive for H5N1 avian influenza
virus, which has killed 42 people in the Southeast Asian country
since late 2003. Further tests have been carried out to confirm the infection.
Bird flu has re-emerged in poultry, mostly waterfowl, in 4 northern
provinces of Son La, Quang Ninh, Nam Dinh, and Nghe An and the
southern Mekong delta city of Can Tho in recent weeks. The
Agriculture Ministry warned that outbreaks could spread further and
criticized local authorities' and farmers' lax vigilance and failure
to vaccinate their waterfowl.
"We expect isolated bird flu outbreaks, but nothing like the major,
widespread outbreaks of 2003 and 2004," Deputy Agriculture Minister,
Bui Ba Bong, said. Bong said vaccinations, disinfecting the
environment, and tight control over the transport of birds would be
key to keeping the virus from spreading further.
Viet Nam has vaccinated more than 115 million poultry so far this
year [2007], according to the Department of Animal Health. Bong also
defended a government decision to lift a 2005 ban on hatching and
restocking waterfowl, saying it was not to blame for the latest
cases. "One of the main causes of the bird flu resurgence is the
failure to vaccinate waterfowl," he said.
Apart from killing birds that have not been vaccinated, the spread of
the virus in May [2007], at the beginning of summer, is unusual as
experts have previously said it thrives best in cool temperatures and
weakens in warmer weather. Hoang Van Nam, vice director of the
Agriculture Ministry's Animal Health Department, said that [virus]
samples would be sent abroad for further tests to see if the virus had mutated.

An H5N1 avian influenza victim is now being treated at Bach Mai
hospital in Hanoi. The man is from Thach Da Commune, Me Linh
District, the northern province of Vinh Phuc. According to Bach Mai
Hospital, the man attended his friend's wedding party around one
month ago and he helped slaughter chickens for the party. He began
coughing and experiencing respiratory problems 2 days later. Tests
show that the man's lungs have become white and the test conducted 3
days ago confirmed that the man was positive for the H5N1 virus.
The man's niece had to be hospitalized several days ago and she was
also suspected of having caught the H5N1 virus. The girl didn't have
contact with fowl, didn't eat fowl meat, but she took care of her uncle.
The Tropical Diseases Clinical Hospital has conducted some tests on
the child and the tests show that the girl is negative for H5N1.
However, the child is still being kept in the hospital for further observation.
