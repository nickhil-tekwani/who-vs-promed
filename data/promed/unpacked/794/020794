The Center for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] in Atlanta
[Georgia, USA] detected the presence of an industrial solvent in
medications used by the Social Security Agency [of Panama] (CSS).
Alleyne announces the recall of 7 additional medications and that the
investigations into lisinopril are continuing.
Human error or criminal hand: these are the 2 options that
authorities are presently analyzing in order to determine how
diethylene glycol -- an industrial solvent that is prohibited for
human consumption -- was in a 120-milligram sugar-free antihistamine
with expectorant syrup produced by CSS.
This finding is the product of the investigations into the deaths of
21 persons by a syndrome of unexpected acute renal insufficiency
(SIRA), specifically [found] in the specimens that were sent to the
CDC in Atlanta.
The director of the CSS, Rene Luciani, assured the public that the
institution neither purchased nor used diethylene glycol, therefore
it is improbable that its presence in the examined specimens were the
result of a human error.
In addition, the Minister of Health, Camilo Alleyne, stated that the
investigation into lisinopril was continuing, both at the national
level as well as the international level. He recommended that the
community continue to abstain from using the additional 7 medications
made by the CSS (see table below). Health authorities announced that
they have recalled the syrup from all of the pharmacies and
facilities of the CSS. The official total of affected individuals
remains at 34.
Medicines NOT to take:
- Glycerine guaiacolate
- Theophyllin and Vitamin B Complex
- Expectorant without sugar
- Paracetamol
- Dextromethorphan
- Diphenhydramine

The line of investigation changed radically in a matter of hours.
One of the hypotheses was the toxicity of lisinopril; now the health
authorities are investigating a list of medications whose use is
common, whose indications for use are a simple cold or headache.
Last night when they received notification of a possible alteration
in lot 81105 of an antihistamine expectorant syrup made without
sugar, in 120 milligram-[sized bottles], the majority ran to throw
out their stocks of guaiacolate, [Vitamin] B complex or paracetamol.
This all happened in an atmosphere of tension and astonishment.
Carlos Abadia, the Ex Vice Minister of Health and odontologist
[dentist] from the Social Security Agency (CSS), announced this has
made a "terrible impression. It seems as though there is a poisoning
and this deeply affects the image of CSS," he stated.
Priscila Vasquez, leader of the civil service employees of the CSS,
said that it is necessary for the country to know [as soon as
possible] the results of the investigation currently underway by the
Public Ministry. "They must determine how the substance arrived at
the CSS".
Older adults are most affected by the syndrome [acute unexplained
renal insufficiency], Rafael Medina, of the National Confederation of
Retirees, stated: "Now the situation is more worrisome and therefore
we demand a thorough investigation." He said that today the
Confederation will meet and go before the authorities to demand an
explanation.
The Minister of Health, Camilo Alleyne, said that diethylene glycol
produces the same effects and symptoms associated with the acute
renal insufficiency syndrome and neurologic deficits. But in the
middle of all of this there is good news: with the identification of
the substance, patients who consumed the product [medication
adulterated with diethylene glycol - Mod.MPP] can receive specific
treatment. Alleyne announced that they are requesting the FDA [Food
& Drug Agency] to assist in the studies.
Authorities do not know if all affected patients ingested the syrup
and if it was the cause of the 21 deaths.

The inter-institutional Commission of the Ministry of Health and the
Social Security Agency is releasing information on the advanced
actions taken to determine the causal agent of the unspecified acute
renal insufficiency, for which we are communicating the following
information:
1. The important finding of a substance known as diethylene glycol
within specimens taken from lot number 81-1-05 (1) from syrups made
in the production laboratory of the Social Security Agency [CSS].
2. As a result of the visits, for the purpose of finding a common
denominator between the patients with this syndrome, it was found
that many of the patients had consumed an expectorant (syrup) without
sugar.
3. This finding is the result of a collaboration between the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention of Atlanta [Georgia] of the United
States in the identification and analysis of this product.
4. Also, this finding was a result of the specimens of the
expectorant product that were sent to this Center for analysis
showing the presence of diethylene glycol, providing qualitative
proof [of the finding].
5. This substance (dietheylene glycol) produces the same signs and
symptoms associated with the syndrome of unspecified acute renal
insufficiency.
6. This substance neither constitutes nor forms a part of the primary
materials used for the production of the medications referred to;
therefore, its presence [in the medications] warrants an
investigation.
7. We have asked the authorities for specialists from the Food and
Drug Administration of the United States (FDA) to assist us in the
investigations of all of these substances.
Faced with this situation, the Inter-Institutional Technical
Commission recommends as a preventive measure, until the
investigation is concluded:
1. Remove the sugar-free expectorant from the pharmacies of the
Social Security Agency Facilities.
2. Do not consume the sugar-free expectorant or the following
products from the production laboratory of the Social Security Agency:
- Glycerine guaiacolate
- Theophyllin
- Vitamin B Complex
- Expectorant without sugar
- Paracetamol
- Dextromethorphan
- Diphenhydramine
3. To investigate the production process and the past distribution
and administration of the pharmaceuticals.
4. To send samples of the identified products to the laboratory of
the National Secretariat of Science and Technology (SENACYT) and the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, GA, USA, to
confirm or rule out the presence of diethylene glycol in these
medications.
5. That patients who consumed the products listed in this report and
have symptoms of nausea, vomiting or diarrhea, accompanied by a
decrease in urinary volume, must go to their nearest polyclinic or
health center.
6. To order the Directorate of Pharmacies and Drugs of the Ministry
of Health to take the pertinent measures to recall these medications
and products immediately from public and private [health] facilities.
7. Meanwhile, the investigations will continue on the part of the
Inter-Institutional Commission and the national and international
technical assistance organisations.
8. We are making it clear to the public that new cases may continue
to be found in spite of the measures taken.

[From the above newswires and official Ministry of Health release, it
appears diethylene glycol contamination of pharmaceutical product(s)
has been identified. At present it is unknown if this was an
accidental or intentional contamination, although the Ministry finger
seems to be pointing at a possible intentional contamination, as the
substance should not be in the laboratory where these products are
produced. We await more information as it becomes available.
According to the National Institute of Health Hazardous Substances
Data Bank
(<@term+@rn+111-46-6" target="_blank">http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/r?dbs+hsdb:@term+@rn+111-46-6>,
diethylene glycol can result in central nervous system depression,
degenerative lesions in the liver and kidney, and resultant renal
shutdown as a result of acute tubular necrosis.
In a report cited in reference 4 below: "Diethylene glycol was the
cause of more than 100 deaths in 1937 when it was inadvertently used
as a solvent for sulfanilamide in a pharmaceutical preparation. After
2 to 5 days of consuming this "elixir," which contained 72 percent
diethylene glycol, patients complained of nausea with vomiting,
intense gastrointestinal cramping and diarrhea, and back pain
referred to the kidney area. These symptoms soon led to progressive
liver necrosis, renal tubular degeneration, and death."
In Gosselin et al (reference 1) there is mention that a single oral
dose of between 0.5 to 5 mg/kg is lethal to humans.
According to the HSDB website, for oral exposure, the following is
recommended:
<@term+@rn+111-46-6" target="_blank">http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/r?dbs+hsdb:@term+@rn+111-46-6>
(from reference 5 below).
"0.4.2 Oral Exposure
A. Activated charcoal: Administer charcoal as a slurry (240 mL
water/30 g charcoal). Usual dose: 25 to 100 g in adults/adolescents,
25 to 50 g in children (1 to 12 years), and 1 g/kg in infants less
than 1 year old.
B. Gastric lavage: Consider after ingestion of a potentially
life-threatening amount of poison if it can be performed soon after
ingestion (generally within 1 hour). This is contraindicated in
unintubated patients with a loss of airway protective reflexes or
decreased level of consciousness; following ingestion of corrosives;
hydrocarbons (high aspiration potential); patients at risk of
hemorrhage or gastrointestinal perforation; and trivial or non-toxic
ingestion.
C. Monitor serum electrolytes, glucose and bicarbonate, and renal and
hepatic function.
D. Ethanol - This therapy is effective in non-primates in preventing
formation of the acid metabolite and lessening toxicity. There are no
data regarding efficacy in humans. Loading dose 8 to 10 mL/kg of 10
percent ethanol IV; maintenance dose 1 to 2 mL/kg/hr IV. Maintain
blood ethanol at 120 mg/dL. Endpoint of therapy in diethylene glycol
intoxication has not been established.
E. Fomepizole is a specific antagonist of alcohol dehydrogenase and
is now available as an alternative to ethanol in the treatment of
ethylene glycol poisoning. Although not approved for DEG poisonings,
fomepizole has been used experimentally in humans. 1) Loading dose
of 15 mg/kg intravenous infusion over 30 minutes is followed by doses
of 10 mg/kg every 12 hours for 4 doses, then 15 mg/kg every 12 hours
until therapy can be discontinued. Endpoint of therapy in diethylene
glycol intoxication has not been established."
