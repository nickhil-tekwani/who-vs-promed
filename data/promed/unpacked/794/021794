[An update about dengue in Saipan -- Many thanks to Jon Bruss for keeping
us posted. It would be interesting to know the dengue type (is it the same
(dengue 2) as in Fiji and New Caledonia?) and to get some information about
the dengue situation in Yap. - TK
We had a second clinical case which has also been serologically confirmed.
In conducting a household survey there are three family members (husband,
mother-in-law, and 1 daughter) all with anti-dengue IgG. Their IgM was
also elevated but not to the reference threshold of the laboratory. Three
other children in the household all had high anti-dengue IgM and IgG. The
husband, mother-in-law, and the daughter all returned from a trip to the
State of Yap, Federated States of Micronesia on February 11, 1998. The
index case and the other three children had not traveled off-island. They
represent local transmission. Only one of the children had been clinically
ill, with vomiting and hematemesis.

[Dr. Bruss does not indicate whether paired serum samples were tested but,
in the absence of any reason to consider a dengue seropositive
insignificant in this instance, it appears that at least presumptive
infections have been identified. That tests of the husband, mother-in-law,
and daughter for IgM antibody were positive, "but not to the reference
threshold of the laboratory", I would suggest that either the standards are
too high or the starting dilution too low. If one begins testing at 1:100
and that is positive, that's that. Sounds to me as though there are at
least two cases plus six other infections. - Mod.CHC
