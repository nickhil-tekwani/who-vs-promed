White-tailed Deer in Portage County Tests Positive for CWD
----------------------------------------------------------
A 2nd white-tailed deer has tested positive for chronic wasting
disease (CWD), from a herd of deer that was euthanized in November
[2008] on a Portage County hunting preserve. The 1st CWD-positive
deer, a 7.5-year-old doe, was discovered during routine testing after
it was shot in September [2008]. That discovery led to destroying the
herd so the rest of the deer could be tested. The 2nd positive deer
is a 3.5-year-old doe.

Wildlife specialists from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife
Services shot 64 deer at Alligator Creek Whitetails LLC near Junction
City, beginning Wednesday 12 Nov 2008, and finishing Tue 18 Nov 2008.
Because the hunting preserve is made up of 119 acres of open, wooded,
and tall-grass marsh lands, the shooters returned after snow fell to
check for tracks to see whether any deer remained. At that time, they
shot 2 more deer. Those CWD test results are not available yet.

The National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa, confirmed
the positive result after initial screening tests at the Wisconsin
Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory in Madison, Wisconsin. The
CWD-positive deer had been born on the property and did not have ties
to any other deer farm. The preserve was placed under quarantine
immediately when the 1st positive test result was reported 9 Oct 2008
to the state veterinarian's office. A quarantine means that no live
deer could be moved onto or off the premises.

Areas of heavy deer traffic on the preserve will have the top soil
removed and replaced to reduce the risk of contamination. Stocking
deer or elk on the property is prohibited for 5 years, and fences
must be maintained during that time to prevent free-ranging deer from
entering. The herd owner will receive state and federal indemnities
that pay a portion of the appraised value of the deer.

This was the 1st new CWD-infected herd on a Wisconsin farm since
January 2005. To date, 98 farm-raised animals in Wisconsin have
tested positive for CWD, including 82 on a separate Portage County
operation. One of the infected animals was an elk; the rest have been
white-tailed deer. More than 22 500 farm-raised deer in Wisconsin
have been tested for CWD.

Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a disease that is known to affect
deer, elk and moose. Prions -- a particular type of protein in the
brain -- become malformed and create microscopic holes in the brain.
The disease is always fatal. Scientists have not determined exactly
what causes the malformed prions or how the disease is transmitted,
but one means of transmission may be ingestion of prion-contaminated
soil. When CWD was 1st reported in free-ranging white-tailed deer in
Wisconsin in February 2002, it was the 1st appearance of the disease
east of the Mississippi River. CWD was 1st found in a Wisconsin
farm-raised deer in September 2002.

Health sampling of white-tailed deer completed
-----------------------------------------------
With more than 8400 samples collected a health check sampling of
white-tailed deer that focused on chronic wasting disease and bovine
tuberculosis (TB) in the WDNR's [Wisconsin Dept of Natural Resources]
18-county Northern Region has been completed. To obtain a
statistically valid sample a total of 8000 deer, about 500 per county
were needed.

Northern Region Wildlife Staff Supervisor Mike Zeckmeister said all
the samples have been sent to a lab in Madison, Wisconsin, to check
for the diseases, and the results of those tests should by in by the
end of January [2009]. "More importantly," he said, I want to thank
all the hunters, meat processors, taxidermists, students and DNR
staff who assisted us by bringing deer in for sampling. We could not
have done this with out their help."

The Deer Health Surveillance program began in January of last year
[2007] when wildlife and other DNR staff took tissue samples from
road kill deer. Adult deer heads were needed to obtain the lymph
nodes located in the neck of the animal. The nodes are then analyzed
for CWD and other diseases. The DNR wanted to get as many samples as
possible prior to the busy fall hunting season. By the start of the
bow deer season on 13 Sep 2008, 40 percent of the goal had been
reached. A plan was devised to contact taxidermists, meat processors,
student volunteers and others to ensure a supply of samples coming
in. At the start of the 9-day gun deer season about 80 percent of the
samples had been collected and the work was over in Polk, Burnett and
Washburn counties.

"We used word of mouth, news releases, radio contacts and posters to
get the message out that we needed deer for this sampling effort and
it paid off," Zeckmeister said. "But the last 25 percent would be
tough because we also had to do age sampling along with CWD sampling,
and this was a big challenge. The aging information we collect every
year is critical especially this year [2008] considering that deer
populations appear to be closer to over winter goals sooner than we expected."

As had been done during the bow and antlerless only hunt, hunters
cooperated in the aging and sampling effort by supplying their
harvested animals. By the end of the gun deer season, the age and
health check sampling goals were met.

"The white-tailed deer is an important component of our recreation
and economy, and this health check is one tool we use to ensure this
resource is maintained and protected," Zeckmeister said. He added
that preliminary results show no signs of bovine TB and tests are
coming back negative for CWD. The DNR does intensive health checks
periodically. The last check in the north was done in 2002 shortly
after the discovery of CWD in the southern part of the state.
