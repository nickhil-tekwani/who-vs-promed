A dengue fever outbreak is causing worries in the region of Mae Hong
Son, as it is expected to be more serious than last year's [2008].
Dr. Suwat, the medical expert of the Public Health Office at Mae Hong
Son, has reportedly released information indicating that dengue fever
could cause more trouble for the local medical authorities as
compared to last year [2008]. This seems to be true when you look at
the facts and the statistics involved in the matter.

There have been around 155 cases of dengue fever reported to date
this year [2009], which, when compared to last year, is already a
2-fold increase in the count.

The doctor believes that people can do a lot to prevent an outbreak
and has suggested measures that could go far in doing so. Some of
these include using mosquito repellents, sleeping under mosquito
nets, and changing the water in vases on a weekly basis.

Last week [week of 31 May 2009], 8 unconfirmed [dengue] cases were
detected in Mauritius. Since our country does not yet have the
equipment needed to verify the samples, they were sent to South
Africa for further tests. The reports came today [12 Jun 2009], and
over 70 cases of dengue fever have been spotted in Mauritius. The
disease is caused by [viruses transmitted by] a mosquito called
_Aedes albopictus_, which has black and white marks. The Ministry of
Health of Mauritius has already started its country-wide mosquito
repelling process.

The state Secretariat of Health (SESA) up to 25 May [2009] registered
41 503 suspected dengue cases in Espirito Santo. In 2009, 30 people
died due to the disease in the state. Another 23 deaths are under
investigation.

The municipalities with the greatest number of [dengue] reports are,
in order, Serra, Vila Velha, Vitoria, Nova Venecia and Baixo Guandu.

Up to this past Friday [6 Jun 2009], 1434 suspected cases of severe
dengue have been registered; they have recovered. Of these, 236 were
confirmed as dengue with complications (DC) and 127 as DHF. The
remaining ones are under investigation.

Of the 30 [dengue] confirmed deaths, 15 were DHF and were recorded in
the municipalities of Serra, Linhares, Vila Velha, Guarapari, Nova
Venecia, Conceiacao da Barra, and Vitoria. The other 15 deaths,
classified as DC, occurred in Vila Velha, Cariacica, Baixo Guandu,
Nova Venecia, Vitoria and Serra.

According to SESA, dengue with complications (DC) is any event that
does not fit the criteria for classification as classical dengue and
DHF when these criteria are unsatisfactory given the severity of the
clinical and laboratory picture. Pertinent complications include
neurological disorders, cardiopulmonary dysfunction, liver failure
and gastrointestinal bleeding, for example. The analysis of cases
under investigation are completed within 90 days, starting at the
date of death.
