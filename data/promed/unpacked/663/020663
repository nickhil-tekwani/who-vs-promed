Dysentery Spreads Nationwide
-------------------------------
The Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) announced Thursday that cases
of
amoebic dysentery have been reported on Cheju Island and in Kyongbuk
province. Due to flooding caused by typhoon Yanni and the increased
traffic
as people travel over the 'Chusok' holiday, the ministry fear that a
nationwide epidemic is in the offing.
The disease, first found in Taegu
last March is now spreading all over the country with a total of 464
cases
confirmed so far, compared to just 11 in 1997, 9 in 1996 and 23 in 1995.
To
date the ministry have not been able to trace the source of the disease
and, as many children are stricken, is presuming food sources at school
canteens may be responsible.
