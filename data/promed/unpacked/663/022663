A total of 4 island residents have been diagnosed with the infectious disease tularemia, commonly known as rabbit fever, according to the Nantucket Health Department.

Town officials are urging island residents to avoid touching dead rabbits or other small animals, or approaching any animal that appears to be disoriented or sluggish. The Health Department is also advising landscapers to wear respirator masks when cutting grass over 6 inches tall to reduce the risk of exposure in the event a hidden animal is struck and the bacterium can become aerosolized.

Tularemia, caused by the bacterium _Francisella tularensis_, can be transmitted to humans who handle sick or deceased animals or are bitten by infected ticks or deer flies, according to the CDC. It can also be transmitted by inhaling contaminated dusts or aerosols. The disease, which can cause fever, skin ulcers, and pneumonia, and is potentially life-threatening in rare cases, is most often treated and controlled successfully with antibiotics.

"We need the public to be aware," Nantucket Health Department director Richard Ray said. "If there's a dead animal near the side of the road, ignore it, do not let your animal go near it, and call the DPW [Department of Public Works] to remove it. Please be careful about where your lawnmower goes and what it runs over. We've had a few cases over the years, but not 4 at one time."

[Human infection with _Francisella tularensis_, a Category A bioterrorism agent, continues to be a problem on Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket, islands off the southern coast of Cape Cod in Massachusetts. A substantial number of the cases are pneumonic, occurring in landscapers and gardeners, related to the aerosolization of infective bacteria.

Telford and colleagues (1) have investigated the genetic diversity of _F. tularensis_ obtained from Martha's Vineyard ticks. Between 2001 and 2003, 0.7 per cent of 4246 dog ticks (_Dermacentor variabilis_) harbored the tularemia bacillus, and there was a degree of genotypic diversity suggestive of long-standing enzootic transmission of the infection on the island. The authors review information regarding the island's tularemia, which appears to have been a relatively recent introduction into Massachusetts. They state that prior to 1937, only one case of the infection was recognized, related to contaminated rabbit meat from the mid-western USA. In 1937, however, more than 20 000 cottontail rabbits from the mid-western states of Missouri and Kansas were introduced into the Massachusetts mainland and Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket for sporting purposes (2). Cases began to occur starting several years later.
