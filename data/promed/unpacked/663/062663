There have been at least 20 cases of measles in South Sudan's Maban County since 31 Oct 2014, according to aid group Medair. Thousands of vaccine [doses] have been sent to the area to contain the outbreak.

Cases have been identified in all 4 refugee camps in Maban: Yusuf Batil, Kaya, Gendrassa, Doro, as well as among the host community who live in the surrounding areas. Mary Bradley, Medair Health Manager said the vaccination campaign has gotten underway after the discovery of more cases in Yusuf Batil refugee camp. "While we were waiting on the supplies for this to arrive, our health workers have been finding cases in the community and giving treatment to those already infected," said

"It's a huge undertaking. We're expecting to see around 19 000 children in the 10 days of the campaign. We have a team of 80 people involved who are working long days towards achieving that. We've done 3 days so far, and we're ahead of schedule. We've seen more than 8000 children so far," she said.

Meanwhile, as part of an integrated campaign, other aid organizations are expected to carry out the same vaccinations in the other camps in the county.

Egypt is no longer free from Measles
[The] Egyptian Ministry of Health responded to [the] death of 6 children in Siwa Oasis. Most news today revealed the death of 6 cases infected with measles and more than a hundred of cases suffer the infection.Health authorities work now to stop the spread of the disease there. Efforts from Ministry of Health should come soon to stop measles in Siwa to avoid the spread of the disease to other parts of the country. The basic reproduction number (R0) of measles is too high and require rapid response from the health authorities in Egypt.

[While this arrived without a URL, an article in Youm7 in Arabic containing the above information can be found at: http://tinyurl.com/n4jjexn. In this article there is mention of 139 cases of measles with 6 deaths. While figures on vaccination coverage were not provided, the article mentioned there was low coverage to explain the outbreak.- Mod.MPP]

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Abdallah Samy for submitting this information and alerting us to this outbreak. In another media report in the Egypt independent, there is mention of a total of 1356 cases including 8 deaths in Egypt this year (2014), with 6 of these 8 deaths reported in Siwa. http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/health-ministry-1356-cases-infected-measles-8-deaths-so-far. This report mentioned that the vaccination coverage in the area was approximately 50 percent.

The Siwa Oasis is an oasis in Egypt, located between the Qattara Depression and the Egyptian Sand Sea in the Libyan Desert -- Qesm Siwah, Matrouh Governorate, Egypt at a distance of nearly 50 km (30 mi) east of the Libyan border, and 560 km (348 mi) from Cairo. The oasis covers a distance of 80 km (50 mi) long and 20 km (12 mi) wide. It has a settlement of approximately 23 000 Berber/Siwi speaking people in a fairly isolated settlement. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siwa_Oasis.

Two confirmed cases of measles were reported from the Grand Traverse County Health Department on Thursday [4 Dec 2014].

According to the Health Department, the 2 cases were both unimmunized and recently returned from the Philippines. Both cases are adults, and no schools have been affected. The Philippines reported more than 50 000 cases and more than 100 deaths in 2014.

"Measles is a highly contagious infection caused by a virus that is spread through the air," said Medical Director Dr. Michael Collins. "It can be quite serious, especially for young children under 5 and for adults, especially those with other chronic illnesses."

Close contacts have been isolated and are being monitored for symptoms. "The best way to protect yourself from the measles is to get vaccinated with the MMR (measles/mumps/rubella) vaccine, which is very effective and safe," said Health Officer Wendy Trute, of the Grand Traverse County Health Department.

The Michigan Department of Community Health says these are the 1st measles cases in Michigan in 2014. In the nation, 600 cases of measles have been reported in 2014, which is the highest number of cases since 1994.

[The fact that the 1st 2 cases of measles of the year (2014) in Michigan state are unvaccinated adults returning from the Philippines indicates that the state has achieved a high level of protection by vaccination.

Christus St. Vincent Regional Medical Center and the state Department of Health are working to identify patients, staff and visitors who may have been exposed to a measles patient during a 2-day stay at the hospital, according to hospital spokesman Arturo Delgado. The department will then contact those who may have been exposed.

The patient, a one year old from Rio Arriba County, was 1st seen on 25 Nov 2014 in the Christus emergency department. After 2 days of inpatient treatment for an identified respiratory issue, additional tests returned a measles diagnosis.

"The hospital followed its established infection control procedures with the patient. The patient received further treatment and was released," according to hospital spokesman Arturo Delgado. The child had not yet been immunized against the disease, according to the Health Department. This is the 1st confirmed measles case in New Mexico since February 2012.

Measles has been on the rise across the United States, and so far in 2014, there have been 603 confirmed measles cases reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. This is the highest number of cases since the year 2000, the CDC said.

Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by a virus, according to the CDC website. "It spreads through the air through coughing and sneezing. Measles starts with a fever, runny nose, cough, red eyes, and sore throat, and is followed by a rash that spreads all over the body. About 3 out of 10 people who get measles will develop one or more complications including pneumonia, ear infections, or diarrhea. Complications are more common in adults and young children," according to the CDC.

In New Mexico, 80-89 percent of the population has been vaccinated against measles and other contagious viruses.

Adults needing measles vaccine can contact their medical provider or local pharmacy. Children who have no insurance coverage can get the vaccine at their local public health office. Public health office contact information can be found in the blue pages of the phone book or online at http://www.nmhealth.org.
