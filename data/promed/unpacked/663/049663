[This is the 2nd part of the daily update following the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on selected countries of interest. To reduce the size of these posts, there will be changes over the coming days. The tables will be reduced but are available at the source URLs and will be referred to in the summaries of daily changes for each country. Countries that have almost interrupted transmission and have been lifting restrictions (China, South Korea) and have lessons to learn as they attempt to prevent explosive 2nd waves will continue to be profiled. We will attempt to select countries from each region on a daily basis. - Mod.UBA]

[According to the report above, in the past 24 hours, there have been 57 newly confirmed cases in China, 19 of which were imported and 38 locally acquired, 36 in Beijing and 2 in Liaoning province. No new deaths were reported. Also, 1 new case was reported in Hong Kong, and none in Macau and Taiwan. A total of 1827 imported cases have been reported. There have been no new deaths reported for several weeks, further supporting the trend of reduced level of cases in the country.

There were 9 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic individuals in the past 24 hours; 6 were imported. There were 2 cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The recent previous reports of a conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic were on 4, 6, 8, 9, 10 and 11 Jun 2020 when 1 conversion was reported each time. Prior to that, there were 2 cases on 1 Jun 2020, and a single case was reported on 18 May 2020 (COVID-19 update (194): China, S Korea, countries w/ high local trans, Italy phase 2 20200519.7352327).

Recurrent questions: What is the total number of asymptomatic cases? What is the total number of asymptomatic cases that converted to symptomatic? What is the proportion of asymptomatic imported cases that have been linked to transmission chains resulting in outbreak clusters?

[In the past 24 hours, according to the report at the source URL, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 34 cases and 0 new deaths, compared with 49 cases and no new deaths during the previous day (13 Jun 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 67 consecutive days. Today's (14 Jun 2020) breakdown of cases: 31 cases were locally transmitted, and 3 were imported cases. Locally acquired cases were in Seoul (12), Gyeonggi (9), Incheon (8), Gangwon-do (1) and Deagu (1). Imported cases were in Daegu (1), Gangwon-do (1) and Quarantine (1). Note that 12 provinces did not report any newly confirmed cases.

Updated tables and graphs can be found at Notice 371 https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030.

The impression (hasn't changed): Lifting of measures has been accompanied by increases in locally acquired infections through increasing clusters related to gatherings of people at employment (bringing it outside employment to contacts) and in houses of worship, and bars and clubs. It just takes one super-spreader in a crowded place to transmit and lead to a sizeable cluster.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 236 651 cases, including 34 301 deaths, up by 346 cases and 78 deaths in the past 24 hours. The previous day's (12 Jun 2020) 24-hour change was 163 cases and 56 deaths. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are still in decline. As it has been, the major increase in cases was in Lombardy, reporting 210 newly confirmed cases.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in Lombardy, the original epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna, Lazio, Piedmont, and Liguria (see tables at http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_notizie_4885_0_file.pdf and http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_notizie_4885_1_file.pdf>). Lombardy again reported the largest number of newly confirmed cases in the 24-hour period (210) and was the only province reporting more than 50 new cases. Also, 16 provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (7 provinces reported no new cases), with another 4 provinces reporting fewer than 50 newly confirmed cases.

The top 5 provinces by cumulative case count remain unchanged and are Lombardy, followed by Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Tuscany. The top 5 provinces by number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours are Lombardy (210), followed by Piedmont (40), Emilia-Romagna (28), Lazio (25), and Veneto (13).

Italy is now 40 days post phase 2 initial opening up and 24 days post 2nd stage of phase 2 opening up. See summary observations of the Ministry of health in section B, immediately below.

[4] Iran: 184 955 total cases, 8730 deaths

Iran's President Hasan Rohani has said that restrictions to stem the coronavirus pandemic will be reimposed in the country if citizens continue to disobey public-health regulations.

After gradually relaxing its lockdown since mid-April, Iran in recent weeks has seen a sharp rise of new daily infections.

Rohani said in a televised speech on 13 Jun 2020 that compliance with health regulations had been as high as 80 percent in mid-May 2020. But he said compliance was now down to only about 20 percent.

Rohani blamed Iran's latest surge of COVID-19 on travelers that he said had been spreading the coronavirus to previously low-risk provinces.

With 2410 new cases on 13 Jun 2020, the total number of confirmed cases in Iran is now about 185 000.

Iran's Health Ministry said on 13 Jun 2020 that 71 people had died from the virus during the previous 24 hours.

The total number of deaths in Iran from COVID-19 on 13 Jun 2020 was 8730, the ministry said.

Rohani expressed concern about mass prayers at the recently reopened Imam Reza shrine, Iran's largest Shi'ite Muslim religious complex in the northeast of the country.

"If there is no cooperation, we will have to reimpose the restrictions," Rohani said, adding that adherence to the health restrictions was needed "to keep businesses open."

Tehran faced resistance from hardline clerics before it closed holy shrines in mid-March 2020. The closures sparked protests, with angry crowds storming the shrines of Imam Reza in Mashhad and Fatemeh Massoumeh in Qom.

[As of 13 Jun 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran is 184 955, including 8730 deaths, an increase of 2410 new cases and 71 deaths since 12 Jun 2020.

Iran has started relaxing restrictions on a more widespread basis in the country. As stated previously, with the increasing daily case reports having surpassed the prior peak in late March-early April 2020, it is clear that there is now a 2nd wave, most likely due to too early lifting of restrictions. The key concern will be whether people begin travelling again within the country and may transport the virus from one zone to another.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 2 142 224, including 117 527 deaths, an increase from 2 116 922 cases and 116 825 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York City had a cumulative total of 206 322 as of 13:00 EDT (GMT-4) on 12 Jun 2020 including 17 388 confirmed deaths and an additional 4688 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

The top 10 states in terms of daily reported cases in descending order are California, Texas, Florida, Arizona, North Carolina, Louisiana, Georgia, New York, Alabama, South Carolina, and Illinois.

In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by New Jersey, California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Texas, Pennsylvania, Florida, Michigan, and Maryland, unchanged from yesterday (12 Jun 2020). A total of 38 states and entities have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html) has data on cases, hospitalization, testing and epidemiologic variables such as age, race, ILI (influenza-like illness), surveillance and emergency room visits, definitely worth reviewing, a welcome series of analyses.
