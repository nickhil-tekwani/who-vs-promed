India: undiagnosed disease causes death of 15 children in Gujarat
-----------------------------------------------
2 more children succumbed to a mysterious killer virus in the Pediatric ICU
ward of SSG hospital on Sun 11 Jul 2004, even as 4 new cases were reported
in the last 12 hours. With 3 children already admitted to SSG Hospital, and
one at CHC in Halol, the number of affected children has risen to 23, of
which, 15 have already succumbed to the virus. A 4-year-old child from
Halol, who was hospitalized on Sat 10 Jul 2004, died last night [Sun 11 Jul
2004]. Another 3-year-old, from Dabhoi, who was admitted on Thu 8 Jul 2004,
died at SSG Hospital around 2 pm on Sun 11 Jul 2004. Doctors at the
Pediatric department, however, say that chances of survival increase when
an affected child survives more than 48 hours, with treatment in the ICU.
The children admitted to the hospital on Sun 11 Jul 2004 were a 6-year-old
child from Gogamba taluka, a 10-year-old child from Chotaudepur taluka, and
an 8-year-old child from Pawi Jetpur taluka. The origin of these new cases
suggests that the virus is prevalent in Chhotaudepur, Kwant, Pawi Jetpur
and Dabhoi taluka of Vadodara district; Gogamba, Halol and Godhra taluka of
neighboring Panchmahal district; and Alirajpur taluka of Madhya Pradesh.
Meanwhile, a Pune-based National Institute of Virology (NIV) team continued
collection of samples of mosquitoes and flies, blood, urine, and stool
samples of patients and their close contacts, as well as blood samples of
domesticated animals. "The team will visit the SSG hospital on Mon morning
[12 Jul 2004] to collect samples," stated chief district health officer Dr.
K. B. Patel.
In Panchmahals, health officials were monitoring the spread of the virus,
which has, so far, claimed 4 lives in the last few days. Health Department
Chairperson Kanta Jani said health teams are camping in affected villages
to monitor the spread of the illness. District health officer Dr. B. P.
Itare said that the teams were continuously checking for mosquito
infestation and carrying viral autopsy [? sending autopsy specimens for
viral studies - Mod.MPP] of close contacts of patients. He said an NIV team
is likely to visit Halol on Mon 12 Jul 2004.

[This report gives no indication of the nature of the illness, other than
that the activities of the team from the National Institute of Virology
suggest that a mosquito-borne virus may be involved. Previous reports of
undiagnosed disease in Gujarat, in 2002 and 2003, remain unresolved (see
below). Further information from the area would be appreciated. - Mod.CP]
