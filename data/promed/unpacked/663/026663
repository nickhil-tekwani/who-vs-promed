During the last week of January 2000, ten cases of febrile illness with
differential diagnoses of dengue or leptospirosis were seen at the State
Hospital in Kosrae, Federated States of Micronesia. Eight serum samples
from six patients were tested subsequently at the Pasteur Institute in New
Caledonia. All samples were negative for dengue fever. Three of the six
patients were confirmed as leptospirosis and a fourth was diagnosed as [a
presumptive case of leptospirosis. [For two of the six patients no
evidence for infection with a dengue virus or leptospira were found.
