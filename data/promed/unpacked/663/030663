From: Ian Cummings <ICummings@hnne.org>

I'm a practicing emergency physician in northeastern Connecticut (right
where Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Connecticut converge in the
Northeast corner).

My observation is that a lot of the reported rates of Lyme disease are
skewed by reporting bias. That is, practitioners under-report Lyme.

Lyme and other co-infections (ehrlichiosis and babesiosis etc.) are all
reportable conditions and certainly we do backflips to report them.
However, I'm sure even then a lot of cases are missed. Probably simply
because of the sheer volume of cases, plus the notorious under-reporting
from doctor's offices. Plus, I'd bet that serologically confirmed cases are
reported a lot more commonly than primary ECM (and the ECM cases outnumber
the serologically confirmed cases hands-down).

During summer months I see more Lyme/ECM/ehrlichosis than I see
streptococcal pharyngitis, otitis media, and pneumonia combined. All
febrile illnesses in the summer months are suspected Lyme or ehrlichiosis
(we screen for the latter with CBC and SGOT). We also see radiculitis,
Bell's palsy, and even an aseptic meningitis-like picture a lot. I'm
certain that our incidence rates are sky-high.

Anyway, my point is that Lyme and Ehrlichia are probably all over New
England in the wooded areas (and I personally think being near a watershed
has something to do with it) and that rising rates are often just reporting
bias (better reporting). We really have very poor ways to determine true
incidence from clinicians. The reports from Massachusetts need to be
interpreted in this light.

I personally think there's also a lot to be learned about the biology of
Lyme yet.

Just a comment from the front lines.

[Dr. Cummings' comments related to under-reporting of many infections is
certainly true. It is particularly relevant when the primary diagnosis is
made clinically rather than from a serological or microbiological
test. The latter situations can be reported by the laboratory. There is
always the confounding situation of more reports related to increased
publicity and better recognition. Even with this in mind, the information
from Massachusetts does suggest an increase in numbers in areas where the
disease has been seen and spread to other areas. These increases, in the
setting of the withdrawal of the Lyme borreliosis vaccine, further
underscore the need for modalities and behaviors to limit potential
_Ixodes_ tick contact. - Mod.LL]

[One of the challenges to the public health systems around the world is how
to get the "private sector" to report cases of notifiable diseases that are
seen in their outpatient practice. As most hospitals (at least in the USA)
have an infection control officer, occurrences of notifiable diseases have
a greater likelihood of being reported to the public health sector as part
of the routine work conducted by infection control officers. Dr. Cummings
is correct when he speculates that there is probably a high degree of
under-reporting of Lyme disease as the majority of cases tend to present to
outpatient services, and frequently there is empirical treatment without
laboratory confirmation. - Mod.MPP]
