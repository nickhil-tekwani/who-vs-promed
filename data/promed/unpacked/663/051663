[ref: Lalle E, Colavita F, Ianetta M, et al. Prolonged detection of dengue virus RNA in the semen of a man returning from Thailand to Italy, January 2018. Euro Surveill. 2018; 23(18):pii=18-00197]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[This study reports the presence of dengue virus RNA in longitudinally collected semen samples of a previously healthy Caucasian man, returning to Italy from Thailand with primary dengue fever, up to 37 days post-symptom onset, when viremia and viruria were undetectable. This finding, coupled with the evidence of dengue virus negative-strand RNA, an indirect marker of ongoing viral replication, in the cellular fraction of semen, indicates a need to further investigate possible sexual transmission.
