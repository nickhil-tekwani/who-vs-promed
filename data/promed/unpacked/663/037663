Lee eats away at pig fears
REUTER
Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui yesterday joined a drive to ease public fears
over the island's devastating foot-and-mouth epidemic, eating pig knuckles
at a televised "eat-in" to restore confidence in pork. Sporting a waistcoat
reading "Eating pork is healthy and safe", Mr Lee made his personal attempt
to soften the blow of the outbreak, announced on March 20, that has forced a
pork export ban, the slaughter of two million pigs and a tumble in pork prices.

Although a lifting of the ban was not imminent, officials said they were
exploring 13 new overseas pork markets in an attempt to cope with the
epidemic that has wiped out Taiwan's huge exports to Japan. They include
Vietnam, Malaysia, Italy and Britain. Japan and Korea have banned imports of
Taiwan pork. The Philippines has gone further, excluding meat from any
Taiwan livestock.
