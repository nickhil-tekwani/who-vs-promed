As children have died of an unexplained mystery disease in the Muzaffarpur district of Bihar, people are looking at the litchi [fruit]. Muzaffarpur, India's "land of litchis," supplies the bulk of the country's litchi harvest and the classiest varieties. Now reporters are writing on how certain chemicals in the fruit cause fatal brain inflammation in undernourished children below age 15 years.

This litchi scare has hit sales, making prices tumble and affecting the very children whose families depend on the fruit for [their] livelihood. Hypotheses and theories are being reviewed. Experts admit that for 50% of the cases no one knows what the triggers are. And 50% remain undiagnosed and untreated.

Scientists now suggest that the litchi may not be a root cause of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES). Increasingly, a viral explanation for the fatal illness AES in children is gaining ground.

AES strikes early in the morning, with high fever, convulsions, disorientation, coma, seizures -- signs of brain inflammation. Tests reveal very low blood glucose levels, caused by high concentrations of unusual amino acids (hypoglycin A and MCPG) that are also found in litchis.

Experts also point to the human-animal-environment interface as the source of the disease. Given that Indians interact closely with livestock and wildlife, they map various other ways of transmission of AES. For instance, children gorging on litchis can easily pick up fruits contaminated by the saliva, urine, or guano of bats. Bats host more than 60 human-infecting viruses, including the Ebola and Nipah viruses, which cause deadly brain fevers in people.

Regardless, according to outlookindia.comÂ¸ it is really time to figure out exactly why such a fruit is being associated with the deaths of children in Muzaffarpur.

The death toll due to acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) has reached 100 in Muzaffarpur and the adjoining districts in Bihar. Most of the casualties are between the age-group of 1 and 10 years. Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan has advocated setting up of a research institute to identify the reason behind the outbreak of the epidemic, colloquially known as "chamki bukhar" (chamki = seizure).

As per the reports, AES has taken around 12 districts of the state in its grip, including Muzaffarpur, Vaishali and East Champaran. However, Muzaffarpur has been declared as the worst hit zone.

AES is a serious public health problem in India. It is characterized as acute onset of fever and a change in mental status (mental confusion, disorientation, delirium, or coma) and/or new onset of seizures in a person of any age at any time of the year. The disease most commonly affects children and young adults and can lead to considerable morbidity and mortality. The AES cases in Muzaffarpur, Bihar and adjoining litchi-producing districts have been observed mostly during April to June, particularly in children who are undernourished with a history of visiting litchi orchards.

Causative agents of AES
- Viruses are the main causative agents in AES cases, although other sources such as bacteria, fungus, parasites, spirochetes, chemicals, toxins, and noninfectious agents have also been reported over the past few decades.
- Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is the major cause of AES in India (ranging from 5%-35%). Nipah virus and Zika virus are also found as causative agents for AES.
- Herpes simplex virus, influenza A virus, West Nile virus, Chandipura virus, mumps, measles, dengue, parvovirus B4, enteroviruses, Epstein-Barr virus and scrub typhus, _S. pneumoniae_ are the other causes of AES in sporadic and outbreak form in India.

Symptoms of AES include high fever, headache, sensitivity to light, stiff neck and back, vomiting and confusion. In severe cases, seizures, paralysis and coma occur.

As mentioned above, JEV is the major cause of AES in India. It is a mosquito-borne flavivirus and belongs to the same genus as dengue, yellow fever, and West Nile viruses.

There is no cure for the disease. Treatment is focused on relieving severe clinical signs and supporting the patient to overcome the infection.

Treatment for encephalitis
- Children suffering from encephalitis should be kept in the intensive care unit (ICU) to avoid any major mishap.
- They can be treated with anti-inflammatory drugs, such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen and naproxen sodium, to reduce headaches and temperature.
- Most cases of encephalitis are resolved in a few days. In case of a severe condition, it may take a few weeks.

[The number of cases of AES in the area continues to grow. Although lychee fruit consumption by malnourished children is the main suspected etiology of AES in recent reports, apparently some scientists in India think that a virus, probably Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), is responsible for some of the cases. As noted previously, frequently some cases of AES are attributed to Japanese encephalitis, but many are of undefined etiology. The determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive. AES has continued to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heatstroke, lychee fruit consumption, and scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_). A recent publication states that dengue virus is one of the 3 most common agents identified in AES, but existing surveillance for AES does not include routine testing for dengue.

It has been proposed previously that consumption of lychees is responsible for some encephalitis cases. Encephalopathy and hypoglycemia have been associated with consumption of lychee fruit containing phytotoxins, specifically alpha-(methylenecyclopropyl)glycine (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20150201.3132842). However, Dr Jacob John has asserted that many of these are hypoglycemic Reye syndrome cases. He noted that in the pre-monsoon period, particularly in May and June, outbreaks of Reye-like acute hypoglycemic encephalopathy occur in the northwestern region of Bihar state and that is also popularly, but unfortunately, called AES. Many doctors, the media, and the public consider these encephalopathy cases as encephalitis because of the term AES. This has been now clarified, and in June 2014, children were treated by 10% dextrose infusion and many lives were saved. Other etiologies have been proposed by clinicians. A published article in a pediatric journal proposed that some cases are due to heat stroke. A 16 Jun 2019 report stated that the Bihar state health department in a press release said maximum deaths have occurred this year due to hypoglycemia resulting from high heat, humidity and no rain (http://en.rfi.fr/asia-pacific/20190616-heatwave-encephalitis-deaths-skyrocket-bihar-northern-india). In that press release, no mention is made of lychee consumption or virus infections.

Until the etiology (or etiologies) of these AES cases is determined, effective and efficient prevention of these cases will not be possible. The presence of enterovirus had earlier been confirmed in the cerebrospinal fluid of one of the patients when it was tested at the virology lab attached to the Government Medical College, Alappuzha (https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/enterovirus-led-to-encephalitis-in-malappuram/article27957202.ece). Enterovirus infections have been attributed before as etiological agents of AES, but laboratory confirmations are scarce. - Mod.TY
