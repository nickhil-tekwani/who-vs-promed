New outbreaks (1)
Outbreak 1: Harino, Kostromskoy, Kostromskaya Oblast [Kostroma]
Date of start of the outbreak: 9 Aug 2018
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Birds / 498 485 / 506 / 506 / 1223 / -

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Birds / 0.10 / 0.10 / 100 / **

**Not calculated because of missing information

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: The virus isolate was identified as H5N2 subtype by PCR and nucleotide sequencing. The comparative analysis of the obtained nucleotide sequences of the H gene and N gene fragments revealed that the isolate belongs to the Asian genetic lineage of highly pathogenic avian influenza (Clade 2.3.4.4.), which spread in the Russian Federation as well as in Asian, European, Middle Eastern, and African countries in 2016-2018. The hemagglutinin cleavage site has a -REKRRKRGLF- structure, characterizing the virus as potentially highly virulent.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; screening; quarantine; official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste; stamping out; control of wildlife reservoirs; disinfection; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
All-Russian Research Institute for Animal Health (FGBI-ARRIAH) (national laboratory) / Birds / reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 11 Aug 2018 / positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.
