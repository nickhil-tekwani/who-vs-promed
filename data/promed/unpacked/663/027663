Comments James Chin's contribution on the "outbreak of RVF" in Mauritania.
Aioun is the capital of Hodh El Gharbi Region. Thousands of "febrile
disease" [cases occurred in September and October. The exact number is
still unknown as all data have not been analysed yet. However, this region
is a malaria endemic area and RVF is probably not the only cause of fever.
In addition to the 6 deaths reported in September, 6 other deaths occurred
in October. One of the confirmed cases died but after the taking of blood
(not post-mortem sample). Animal abortion rates were high but much lower
than during the epidemics that occurred in 1987 in the South of the
Country. In the 7 flocks we investigated, the average abortion rate since
the beginning of the rains was 20%.
Assaba is another region where RVF cases might have occurred. In the
regional hospital in Kiffa, 155 cases of fever were admitted from
September,1 until October, 20. The proportion of under-5 year old children
was 14.8% (only 8.0% in October); the sex-ratio M:F was 1.0. During this
period, 8 deaths occurred, some with haemorrhage (CFR : 5.2%). However,
although environmental conditions in Kiffa Region are the same as in Aioun
Region, numbers of fevers admitted in Kiffa Hospital in September and
October were not higher than previous years. Blood samples were collected
and will be analysed soon.

[Members might wish to refer to the postings we had earlier this year on
the RVF epidemic in Kenya and surrounding areas. There are interesting
parallels, as one might expect, for example the coincident malaria, the
uncertainty of actual numbers, as well as some possible differences, e.g.,
apparently lower CFR. - Mod.MHJ
