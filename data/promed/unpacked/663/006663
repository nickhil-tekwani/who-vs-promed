Foot-and-mouth disease, Chinese Taipei
--------------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 8 May 2015 from Dr Ping-Cheng Yang, Vice President, Agriculture Technology Research Institute, Council of Agriculture, Hsinchu City, Chinese Taipei.

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 13 Apr 2015
Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 8 May 2015
Reason for notification: new strain of a listed disease
Manifestation of disease: sub-clinical infection
Causal agent: Foot and mouth disease virus
Serotype: A
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1 (KM): Jinninh Township, Kinmen County [Fukien province]
Date of start of the outbreak: 13 Apr 2015
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected animals
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 176 / 1 / 0 / 1 / 0
Affected population: Cattle (KM)

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: non-structural protein (NSP) antibody reactions were detected in 2 cattle in a farm located in Kinmen County [Fukien Province] during routine serological surveillance. The local disease control center (LDCC) traced back to their farm of origin to conduct movement restrictions, clinical investigation and sampling of sera and oropharyngeal fluid for serological and virological tests. All cattle within the index farm were found in healthy condition without clinical signs of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). After retesting on 1 May 2015, NSP antibody reaction was still detected in one out of the two cattle. The positive cattle was subsequently culled as a precaution measure by the LDCC on 2 May 2015. The result of PCR on 8 May 2015, carried out by the National Laboratory (Animal Health Research Institute, AHRI), showed positive reaction to nucleic acid of FMD virus in that cattle. The positive PCR sample was retested and the obtained product was analyzed. The case was finally confirmed as A serotype FMD infection by AHRI on 8 May 2015. Detailed genetic and phylogenetic analyses of the genomic sequences showed that the strain was most closely (99 percent) related to the A serotype strain isolated in Guangdong Province of China in 2013. All the cattle on the infected farm, including 100 heads of cattle from neighboring farms, will be culled. Epidemiological investigation and surveillance of surrounding cloven-hoofed animal farms will be implemented.

Control measures
Measures applied: quarantine; movement control inside the country; screening; zoning; disinfection of infected premises-establishment(s); no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: stamping out

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Animal Health Research Institute (AHRI) (National laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
1. Cattle / gene sequencing / 8 May 2015 / Positive
2. Cattle / reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 8 May 2015 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.
