Sugar cane farmers in north Queensland are being warned about a
possible outbreak of a devastating crop disease. Sugar cane research
company BSES [Bureau of Sugar Experiment Stations] has detected sugar
cane smut spores at a single site in the Burdekin region, south of
Townsville. BSES chief executive, Eoin Wallis, said the spores were
detected in the Ayr/Home Hill area in the last week of June [2007] as
part of its smut early detection program.
The devastating cane infection kills cane plants. It caused havoc in
Western Australia's sugar industry in 1998, and was detected for the
1st time in Queensland in Childers last year [2006].
The detection of a fine black powder of fungal spores does not
necessarily mean the disease is present in the area, Mr Wallis said,
but farmers need to be vigilant and watch for symptoms of the disease
in their crops. Staff from BSES and the Burdekin Productivity Service
will inspect crops in the Burdekin over the next few days.
Member for Burdekin, Rosemary Menkens, said the region is well placed
to manage any outbreak of sugar cane smut, as farmers have planted
significant amounts of smut-resistant cane varieties. "Nevertheless,
if smut is found in cane, not just in the smut traps, there will be
an economic loss as smut has devastating effects on some of the best
producing varieties of sugar cane," Ms Menkens said. "The challenge
for the Burdekin now will be ensuring we have sufficient quantities
of smut-resistant cane varieties."

Cane smut has been found in north Queensland's Burdekin and further
south in Maryborough, meaning the disease has spread almost the full
length of the state's major cane growing areas. It confirms fears the
entire 500 000 hectare [about 1.24 million acres] crop might have to
be ploughed out. Cane growers chief executive, Ian Ballantyne,
yesterday [11 Jul 2007] predicted reduced production levels and the
planting of replacement crops would cost hundreds of million of
dollars.
Bureau of Sugar Experiment Stations [BSES] program leader, Mike Cox,
said the outbreak was now widespread. BSES had sufficient disease
resistant material ready for any farmer to replant, he said.

[Sugarcane smut is caused by the fungus _Sporisorium scitamineum_. It
is highly infectious and can be spread by wind or carried on clothing
and machinery. Symptoms are a black whip-like structure emerging from
the central core of meristematic tissues, which contains the spores.
Disease management includes use of resistant cultivars and burning of
infected fields after harvest. Sugarcane smut appears to be present
in every sugarcane-growing country worldwide. More information on the
disease can be found in the recent ProMED-mail post 20070604.1800.
