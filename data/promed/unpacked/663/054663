New South Wales [NSW] Health is urging people born during or after
1966 to ensure that they are fully immunised against measles. The
warning comes after NSW Health was notified of 29 cases of measles in
the state in the past 4 weeks. Seven of these cases were directly
linked with unvaccinated or partially vaccinated travellers returning
from overseas.

A spokeswoman from the Northern NSW Local Health Network said there
had not been any reported measles cases in the Tweed region this year
[2011]. However, Tweed residents who are planning overseas travel
should make sure they have received 2 doses of the free
measles-mumps-rubella vaccine at least one month apart from their GP
[general practitioner] or at a travel health clinic.

Tweed residents have been reminded by NSW Health that children or
adults born during or since 1966 who do not have documented evidence
of receiving 2 doses of MMR vaccine or evidence of measles infection
are considered to be highly susceptible to measles.

An outbreak of measles is being spread by unvaccinated travellers who
bring the deadly disease home with them. Western Sydney and Wollongong
are hot spots with 45 cases already reported this year [2011], more
than the total number of cases reported each year since 2007,
according to The Daily Telegraph.

Pockets of NSW [New South Wales] are recording outbreaks, with at
least 23 cases reported in Rooty Hill, St Mary's, Mt Druitt, and Seven
Hills. Health authorities are worried it is spreading because young
adults are not properly vaccinated and are travelling to Europe and
other countries where it is still common. The potentially deadly
disease has almost been eliminated from Australia, where it is now
considered travel-acquired with no "home-grown" cases detected here.

But many people aged 25 to 40 are not protected, even though they
believe they are. "When the vaccination was 1st introduced in 1966, it
was thought one dose was needed," NSW Health communicable diseases
manager Vicky Sheppeard said. "We now know 2 doses are needed, and we
are struggling to get that information out so young adults who are
travelling know that they need to get 2 doses."

At least 7 recent cases were caused by young Australians returning
from overseas and then passing on the highly-infectious disease to
children or family members. Others have come into contact with measles
while in a doctor's surgery or hospital.

Wollongong is in the grips of an outbreak, while doctors believe they
have reduced the spread in western Sydney. Children can't be
vaccinated until they are aged one but then need a follow up when they
are 4. "We have seen mini-outbreaks in families," Dr Sheppeard said.
"Unfortunately this year [2011], some travellers have come back into
communities where children have not been fully vaccinated, or a family
member is not, and we've seen measles spread in pockets." Dr Sheppeard
said there was no indication to suggest measles was spreading because
of some parents' opposition to vaccination. GPs and travel clinics
have been placed on high alert for people about to head overseas.
National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance director
Professor Peter McIntyre said travellers in their mid-20s should be
getting vaccinated: "You don't need to go to some exotic location; you
could pick it up in Europe."

Tweed residents who visited Robina Town Centre, Australia Fair
Shopping Centre or the Brisbane Airport domestic terminal last week
have been warned to be on alert for symptoms of measles. Queensland
Health confirmed a person who visited these locations was infectious
at the time.

The alert is for people who visited Australia Fair and the airport
last Thursday, then Robina Town Centre on Friday. Gold Coast Public
Health medical officer Dr Don Staines said the person had no obvious
link to 2 other cases reported on the Gold Coast earlier this month
[March 2011?] and had probably acquired the disease overseas in
Thailand.

Measles can be very distressing for those affected, and complications
can include pneumonia or encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) and
occasionally death. It can be a severe illness even in otherwise
healthy adolescents and young adults.

The measles spike has grown in Minnesota. The Minnesota Department of
Health now confirms 13 cases. Those affected range in age from 4
months to 34 years. Six cases were children who are old enough to have
been vaccinated but haven't been. The Health Department believes the
outbreak started with an infant who returned from Kenya.

Local public health officials are investigating a confirmed case of
measles in a baby, the 1st such case in Houston in years. The Houston
Area Health Alert Network sent an email on Friday [1 Apr 2011] noting
that an 11 month old child, who attended the Cirque du Soleil
performance at Sam Houston Race Park on 20 Mar 2011, developed fever
the next day and a rash 3 days later. She later tested positive for
the highly contagious virus. The email asked local health care
providers to consider measles in patients presenting with a rash.

The baby is recovering, according to Kathy Barton, spokeswoman for
the Houston health department. Barton said health officials are
aggressively investigating any contact the child may have had with
at-risk people but said the situation is nothing like it was in the
late 1980s and early 1990s, when the city's low child immunization
rate -- 11 per cent -- led to an outbreak that hospitalized a third of
confirmed cases. Houston's immunization rate is now 87 per cent.

Barton said the baby's household contacts are all immune. Measles,
best known for a red skin rash, is a potentially deadly virus
[disease] that spreads through contact with a sneezing, coughing,
infected person. Children 1st get vaccinated for it at 12 months. The
health alert network's email noted that there have been multiple
laboratory-confirmed cases of measles in various parts of the United
States in recent months, including Minnesota, Massachusetts, and
Florida. The local child is believed to have been exposed during a
trip to Orlando, Florida on 2-8 Mar 2011.

The last reported cases of measles in Houston were confirmed in 2005
and 2001. The cases were exposed to the virus on trips to Mexico and
China, respectively.

http://pediatrics.about.com/b/2011/03/31/measles-case-count-heading-for-a-measles-outbreak-record.htm


As many people know, measles cases continue to increase because of
the current measles outbreaks in various parts of the country. The
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention puts us at 35 total cases
for 2011, which now include 6 recent cases in Minnesota.

The only problem with that number is that the recent measles case
count in Minnesota is now at least 14, which means the United States
total is more like 44. In comparison, last year [2010], there were
only 4 reports of measles in the US by the beginning of April 2010. In
2009, the measles case count was also only 4 cases at this point in
the year. Even in 2008, a record year for measles in the US, with a
total of 140 measles cases for the year, there were only 7 cases by
the beginning of April 2008. If we are a third of the way to our
previous measles record in just the 13th week of the year, what does
that mean for the rest of the year?

Keep in mind that as the measles case counts get higher, the chances
of actually seeing children with serious side effects with measles
increases. Fortunately, the more serious measles complications, such
as seizures (0.6 per cent), encephalitis (0.1 per cent), and death
(0.2 per cent), are not very common. But even if only one in 1000
children with measles develops encephalitis, it isn't hard to
understand that as the measles case count approaches 500 or 1000, we
are going to be more likely to see a child with this complication.
Even without the updated numbers, CDC describes the current measles
case count as "beyond historical limits". Hopefully, we won't see just
how far beyond those limits we can reach this year [2011], and we can
move towards the goal of eliminating measles again.

The Hastings and Prince Edward Counties Health Unit has confirmed a
case of measles in a young student in Hastings County. Unit staff said
in a press release they are investigating where the child may have
contracted the illness and are taking steps to prevent it from
spreading to others. "Since the immunization rate in Ontario is high,
the risk to the general public is considered low," said the release,
reporting a 92 per cent immunization rate among school-age children.

"The health unit is recommending that individuals born after 1970,
who have not been immunized with the MMR vaccine, receive the vaccine
through their family doctor or through a health unit immunization
clinic," said the release. "Those born before 1970 likely had measles
in childhood, and are, therefore, protected."

Updates on the measles situation will be posted on

Health officials in Congo [that is, Democratic Republic of Congo] say
an outbreak of measles has left 106 children dead. Congolese officials
said Tuesday [29 Mar 2011] that 90 of the deaths have been in Katanga
province.

Aid group Medecins Sans Frontieres says there have been 21 000 cases
in 5 provinces in the giant Central African nation. The medical aid
group says it has given 1.5 million vaccinations since last year
[2010] but needs help to continue its efforts.

Since 2008, funding cuts for vaccination campaigns have allowed
measles to spread again where previously it was close to being
eradicated. The number of cases has surged, with large outbreaks
reported in 30 African countries. The cost of vaccinating a child
against measles is less than USD 1.00.

Measles Outbreaks and Progress Toward Measles Pre-elimination:
African Region, 2009--2010
--------------------------------------

Introduction
------------
In 2008, the World Health Organization (WHO) African Region (AFR)
measles technical advisory group (TAG) recommended establishing a
measles pre-elimination goal, to be achieved by the end of 2012. The
goal sets the following targets for the 46 AFR countries: Greater than
or equal to 98 per cent reduction in estimated regional measles
mortality compared with 2000; measles incidence of under 5 cases per 1
million population per year nationally; over 90 per cent national
measles-containing vaccine (MCV) 1st dose (MCV1) coverage and over 80
per cent MCV1 coverage in all districts; and greater than or equal to
95 per cent MCV coverage by supplementary immunization activities
(SIAs) in all districts (1). The goal also sets surveillance
performance targets of greater than or equal to 2 cases of non-measles
febrile rash illness per 100 000 population, greater than or equal to
one suspected measles cases investigated with blood specimens in
greater than or equal to 80 per cent of districts, and routine
reporting from all districts (1). In addition, introduction of a
routine 2nd MCV dose (MCV2) was recommended for countries meeting
specific criteria for MCV1 coverage and measles surveillance (1,2).
This report updates progress toward the pre-elimination goal during
2009/2010 and summarizes measles outbreaks occurring in AFR countries
since 2008. Of the 46 AFR countries, 12 (26 per cent) reported measles
incidence of under 5 cases per one million population during 2010,
compared with 28 (61 per cent) in 2008. Furthermore, 28 (61 per cent)
countries reported a laboratory-confirmed measles outbreak during
2009/2010 (3). The recent measles outbreaks highlight the need for
renewed dedication by donors and governments to ensure that national
multiyear vaccination plans, national budgetary line items, and
financial commitments exist for routine immunization services and
measles control activities.

Measles vaccination coverage
----------------------------
The 46 AFR countries* report routine vaccination coverage to the WHO
Regional Office for Africa (AFRO) using the WHO and United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) Joint Reporting Form (JRF) (4). In addition,
WHO and UNICEF publish MCV1 coverage estimates based on multiple data
sources, including JRF reports and demographic surveys (5). As of
2010, MCV1 was administered routinely at age 9 months** in 43
countries, and MCV2 was included in the routine immunization program
in 7 countries (Algeria, Cape Verde, Lesotho, Mauritius, Seychelles,
South Africa, and Swaziland).

During 2001--2008, reported MCV1 coverage increased from 55 per cent
to 79 per cent in the region (6). In 2009, AFR MCV1 administrative
coverage*** was 83 per cent, based on the most recent JRF data; the
WHO and UNICEF regional MCV1 coverage estimate was 69 per cent. In
2009, 4 (9 per cent) countries (Burkina Faso, Gambia, Mauritius, and
Sao Tome and Principe) reported over 80 per cent MCV1 coverage in all
districts. To interrupt endemic transmission of measles, mathematical
models indicate that 93 per cent -- 95 per cent population immunity is
needed (7). Since 1997, 41 (89 per cent) countries (all except
Algeria, Cape Verde, Mauritius, Sao Tome and Principe, and Seychelles)
have conducted an SIA targeting children aged 9 months to 14 years,
and 43 (93 per cent) countries (all except Algeria, Mauritius, and
Seychelles) have conducted at least one SIA targeting children aged 9
to 59 months. A nationwide SIA was conducted in 31 (67 per cent)
countries during 2009/2010; of these countries, 5 (16 per cent)
(Ethiopia, Ghana, Malawi, Zambia, and Zimbabwe) conducted post-SIA
vaccination coverage surveys.

Measles surveillance
--------------------
Data on suspected measles cases are tallied monthly at local health
facilities, reported to the district level, aggregated at the national
level, and annually reported to AFRO using the JRF (8). JRF data on
2010 suspected measles cases were not yet available; thus, 2010
measles case-based surveillance data reported to AFRO by 40 (87 per
cent) countries, in accordance with WHO AFRO measles surveillance
guidelines, are cited instead (8). During 2001/2008, reported measles
cases in AFR decreased by 93 per cent, and estimated measles-related
mortality declined 91 per cent (2). The number of reported measles
cases decreased from 520 102 in 2000 to 37 162 in 2008, then increased
to 83 464 in 2009 and to 172 824 in 2010. Of 172 824 reported cases,
23 842 (14 percent) were laboratory confirmed, and 109 570 (63 per
cent) were confirmed through epidemiologic link**** (3). During 2010,
25 (63 per cent) countries met the non-measles febrile rash illness
reporting target of greater than or equal to 2 cases per 100 000
population, and 29 (73 per cent) had greater than or equal to 80 per
cent of districts reporting greater than or equal to one suspected
cases with blood specimen. The overall confirmed measles incidence for
the region in 2010 was 17.2 per 100 000 population, and 12 (30 per
cent) countries reported measles incidence of under 5 cases per one
million population.

During 2009 and 2010, B3 measles virus was detected in all 25
countries with genotype information and was the predominant genotype
in the region. In addition to the B3 outbreak strain, Angola and
Namibia reported transmission of the B2 genotype, and South Africa
reported 2 additional genotypes: a D4 from a single case imported
during the World Cup games in June 2010 and a D8 from a single case in
2009.

Major outbreaks and response activities
---------------------------------------
During 2009/2010, a total of 28 (61 per cent) of the 46 AFR countries
had laboratory-confirmed measles outbreaks with over 100 reported
measles cases, including 13 countries in 2009 and 15 additional
countries in 2010, compared with 9 (20 per cent) countries in 2008. Of
these 28 countries, 10 reported greater than or equal to 90 per cent
MCV1 coverage in 2009, 15 had a follow-up SIA within 24 months before
the outbreak, and all reported greater than or equal to 90 per cent
SIA administrative coverage in the most recent measles SIA. Of the 28
countries with reported outbreaks, 20 conducted an outbreak
investigation, and 14 implemented an outbreak response immunization
(ORI) campaign or a nationwide SIA following the start of the
outbreak.

In some AFRO countries, frequent outbreaks continued, suggesting that
children [had been] missed by routine vaccinations and by SIAs in
recent years. Measles outbreaks in which the majority of cases
involved children aged under 5 years occurred in Angola, Democratic
Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. Ethiopia, for
example, reported that MCV1 coverage increased from 59 per cent in
2005 to 75 per cent in 2009. The last nationwide measles SIA,
conducted in 3 phases during 2007/2009, targeted children aged 9 to 59
months, with reported coverage of 98 per cent, 92 per cent, and 93 per
cent, respectively.

The 2009 non-measles febrile rash illness rate was 2.4 per 100 000
population, and 87 per cent of districts reported greater than or
equal to one suspected cases with blood specimen. In 2009, 1176
suspected cases were reported, compared with 8261 cases in 2010 in 93
of 96 administrative zones. Of the cases reported in 2010, a total of
4182 (51 per cent) were confirmed by either laboratory testing or
epidemiologic link. Of the confirmed cases, 3142 (75 per cent) were
among children aged under 5 years, and 3877 (93 per cent) were among
unvaccinated persons. In 2010, an ORI campaign was conducted in 54
districts of 5 zones, targeting children aged 6 to 59 months, with
reported coverage over 100 per cent [?].

In AFRO countries with higher, but still suboptimal, MCV1 coverage
and SIA implementation, the age distribution of measles cases shifted
to include older children and young adults. A measles outbreak pattern
in which the age distribution of measles cases included older children
and young adults occurred in Burkina Faso, Malawi, Namibia, South
Africa, and Zambia. In Malawi, for example, reported MCV1 coverage
increased from 82 per cent in 2005 to 92 per cent in 2009; a
nationwide SIA targeting children aged 9 to 59 months was implemented
in both 2005 and 2008, each with over 95 per cent reported coverage.

In 2009, the non-measles febrile rash illness rate was 3.8 per 100
000, and 96 per cent of districts reported greater than or equal to
one suspected case with blood specimen. In 2010, 73 727 suspected
measles cases were reported from 24 of 28 districts in Malawi. Among
35 366 patients reported during 24 Oct 2009 to 17 Jul 2010, a total of
14 627 (41 per cent) were aged under 5 years, 11 391 (32 per cent)
were aged 5 to 14 years, and 9348 (26 per cent) were aged 15 years or
over. An initial ORI campaign was conducted 3 months after the start
of the outbreak in 3 districts targeting children aged 9 to 59 months.
A 2nd ORI campaign was conducted 5 to 6 months after the outbreak
started in 8 districts targeting children aged 6 months to 14 years in
affected schools and prisons with clusters of patients. In 2010, a
nationwide SIA was implemented targeting children aged 6 months to 14
years with over 95 per cent administrative coverage in 26 of 28
districts.

Reasons for non-vaccination identified through outbreak
investigations during 2009/2010 included vaccine unavailability;
strict adherence to the WHO open vial policy, leading to batching of
children into infrequent vaccination sessions; and exclusion of
children aged over 12 months, who were considered ineligible for MCV1.
In addition, unwillingness to receive vaccination was identified among
certain religious groups in Zimbabwe, Botswana, Malawi, and South
Africa.

MMWR editorial note
-------------------
During 2001/2008, AFR countries made remarkable progress in reducing
measles mortality and morbidity by increasing MCV1 coverage and
periodic SIAs (2). However, since reaching an historic low of 32 278
reported cases in 2008, a resurgence of measles led to multiple large
outbreaks during 2009/2010, despite increases in reported MCV1
coverage, indicating the fragility of the progress. Suboptimal routine
and SIA vaccination coverage led to an increasing number of
susceptible persons over a prolonged period of low incidence, allowing
some children to remain susceptible as they grew older. Outbreak cases
occurring among older children and young adults suggest some progress
in reducing measles incidence together with long-standing gaps in
vaccination activities. In countries with large outbreaks occurring
primarily among children aged under 5 years, substantial numbers of
children were missed by both routine vaccination and SIAs in recent
years. In these countries, estimated MCV1 coverage remains suboptimal,
and reviews of vaccination services are needed to identify
programmatic reasons for non-vaccination (9). Detailed outbreak
investigations are recommended to describe the epidemiology of an
outbreak, guide rapid ORI, and determine the likely cause of the
outbreak (such as failure to vaccinate) (1).

The findings in this report are subject to at least 2 limitations.
1st, underreporting of measles cases and low sensitivity of measles
case-based surveillance in some countries likely led to underestimates
of measles incidence. 2nd, SIA administrative coverage over 100
percent suggests inaccurate and inflated reported coverage (9).

Although post-SIA coverage surveys are recommended, only 5 of 31
countries implemented a post-SIA coverage survey during 2009/2010.
Estimates of vaccination coverage from population-based coverage
surveys are key inputs to determine the susceptibility profile of a
population. In addition, reliable coverage estimates can help identify
areas of low coverage so that program managers can better prioritize
and more efficiently use resources. Even though AFR reported MCV
coverage has increased continuously and the quality of measles
surveillance has improved, subsequent measles outbreaks raise doubts
concerning the accuracy and reliability of reported coverage and
surveillance data. WHO-recommended methods for improving the accuracy
of monitoring measles vaccination programs and post-SIA surveys to
estimate coverage should be implemented routinely (1).

The 2009/2010 outbreaks highlight the need for full implementation of
regional strategies, with an emphasis on improving vaccination
coverage through routine immunization services and SIAs in every
district, and introduction of MCV2 into routine immunization services
in eligible countries (1). National immunization program policies and
delivery systems should be reviewed to ensure access to the
recommended 2 doses of MCV by all eligible children. Communication
strategies should be identified to ensure vaccination acceptance and
demand among all segments of the population. Renewed dedication by
donors and governments is needed to ensure that national multiyear
plans, budgetary line items, and financial commitments exist for
routine immunization services and measles control activities.

and the literature references cited in the text.

After a long period of success in reducing the incidence of measles
virus infection in the AFR, there has been a regrettable reversal of
success in the recent past in part due to the factors outlined above
and due to financial constraints.

During 2001/2008, reported measles-containing vaccine 1st dose (MCV1)
coverage increased from 55 per cent to 79 per cent in 46 African
countries, reported measles cases decreased by 93 per cent, and
estimated measles-related mortality decreased 91 per cent. By 2008, 40
of the 46 countries had established case-based surveillance in
accordance with WHO guidelines, and 28 reported measles incidence
under 5 cases per one million population per year.

In 2009, reported MCV1 coverage among the 46 African countries was 83
per cent; 12 (26 per cent) countries had measles incidence of under 5
cases per one million population in 2010, and 28 (61 per cent)
reported laboratory-confirmed measles outbreaks. Despite this
substantial progress toward reducing measles mortality and morbidity,
multiple outbreaks during 2009/2010 showed the gains were fragile, and
epidemiologic investigations of some outbreaks showed a failure to
vaccinate. The reasons for non-vaccination and corrective solutions
need to be determined, the quality of reported data should be
verified, and measles surveillance should be strengthened.

The African Region countries are: Algeria, Angola, Benin, Botswana,
Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Central African Republic,
Chad, Comoros, Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo,
Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea,
Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali,
Mauritania, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda,
Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, South
Africa, Swaziland, Togo, Uganda, United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia,
and Zimbabwe.

Many African governments are not allocating enough funds from their
annual budgets to health, says a study by WHO. Without additional
resources, vital health goals will not be achieved, it says.

In the 10 years since heads of state of African Union countries met
in Abuja, Nigeria and pledged to set a target of allocating "at least
15 per cent" of their annual budget to improve the health sector, only
Rwanda and South Africa have reached the objective, says WHO. -

Confirmed cases of measles continue to increase in Seville [Sevilla].
As of yesterday [31 Mar 2011], they have reached 432, 277 of whom are
directly related to the initial outbreak, while the rest are
considered sporadic cases. Given this finding, the Provincial Heath
Delegation has appealed to people to check on whether their
immunization schedules are up to date -- that is, that children have
received 2 doses of measles vaccine (at 15 months and 3 years), which
is presented as the MMR [measles, mumps and rubella] triple vaccine in
the childhood vaccination schedule.

They have also asked parents and guardians of children between 6 and
15 months of age in Sevilla, as well as the towns of Alcala de
Guadaira, Dos Hermanas, Mairena del Aljarafe and Tomares, to come to
their health centers so that their children receive measles vaccine.
This is an "exceptional and temporary measure for the duration of the
current situation," according to the Health Delegation.

The Provincial Health Delegation has stated that the only way to
prevent this disease is through vaccination. Measles remains a mild
disease, which occurs with a red skin rash and may include, among its
symptoms, otitis media, croup (laryngotracheobronchitis), pneumonia,
diarrhea, seizures, or febrile convulsions. That is why it is
recommended that all parents with children between 6 and 15 months [of
age] residing in the above mentioned localities should go to a health
center to receive the vaccine. For those who have been vaccinated at
younger than 12 months, they should receive a booster dose at 15
months [of age] and again at 3 years, according to the established
protocol. Those babies vaccinated between 12 and 15 months of age only
need to be revaccinated at 3 years of age.

This measure is intended to limit the spread of the virus presently
circulating widely in order to provide greater protection of the
infant population. It was emphasized that children under 6 months are
immunized naturally -- both from the mother during pregnancy and by
breastfeeding -- and, therefore, is not necessary to adopt vaccination
at this age.

The Health Delegation emphasised that the importance of vaccination
as a preventive measure is demonstrated by the fact that of the total
confirmed cases, "none of the victims had been previously
vaccinated."

The city has witnessed a major measles outbreak in the last 3 months,
pushing the total number of cases to an alarming 345 against 279 last
year [2010]. What's more, several children who were vaccinated against
the infection figure in this measles headcount. Surprisingly, the
itchy rash did not spare even 40 and 50 year olds.

District health officials said that outbreak investigations carried
out twice during February and mid-March 2011 all over Hyderabad turned
out to be positive. "There was a spurt in the number of cases during
January, February, and mid March [2011]. A total of 15 cases were
reported last week (21-27 Mar 2011). However, the numbers have shown a
decline since the onset of summer," said Dr B L Veena Kumari, district
medical and health officer.

Authorities at the Fever Hospital said that they have seen 5-6 cases
a day in the last couple of months as against the normal 1-2 cases.
"Around 95 per cent of the cases are of children," said Dr G Vinod,
assistant professor, Fever Hospital.

Doctors at private hospitals who also saw an unusual flow of such
cases said this outbreak was unexpected. "Measles is not common among
adults, but last month [March 2011], we have come across around 8-10
cases," said Dr Aftab Ahmed, physician, Apollo Hospital,
Secunderabad.

Doctors said that measles symptoms include cough, running nose and
itchy eyes similar to the flu, with increased eye irritation. These
symptoms will last several days and are followed by a rash starting on
the head and progressing down the body.

On an average, 9200 children at the age of 9 months are being
vaccinated against measles under the National Immunisation Programme
every month in the city. Most of the children who got the infection
this year [2011] were in the age group of 5-12 years, said officials.
Now, authorities say that a study is being conducted in Andhra Pradesh
to find out why measles is occurring among vaccinated children and
elders as well. "After the study, we will send a report to the central
government requesting that a 2nd dose be given to children at the age
of 18 months," said Dr G Srinivasulu, district immunisation officer.

Hyderabad can be located in the map at

be that the measles vaccination policy in India of a single dose of
vaccine at 9 months will have to be replaced by a 2-dose schedule as
practised in most other countries. - Mod.CP]
