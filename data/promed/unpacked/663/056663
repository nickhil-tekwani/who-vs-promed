In comparison with last year [2012], the incidence of mouse fever [hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, HFRS] has decreased. During 10 months of 2013, 209 cases of "mouse" fever were recorded in the region, 6.5 per 100 000 inhabitants. Morbidity is recorded annually in the Samara region, and the long-term dynamics exhibit a cyclical pattern. In the last 10 years, the highest incidences were recorded in 2003 (500 cases or 15.16 per 100 000 population), in 2008 (607 cases or 19.4 per 100 000 population), and 2012 (813 cases or 25.3 per 100 000 population). The source of infection and the reservoir host of HFRS are wild rodents.

In the absence of adequate treatment, the outcome of infection may be severe and a serious threat to life. Severe forms of the disease are a serious threat to human life, according to the Samara Region Rospotrebnadzor organization.

[Samara is the 6th largest city in Russia and the administrative center of Samara Oblast. It is in the southeastern part of European Russia at the confluence of the Volga and Samara Rivers, on the east bank of the Volga. The Volga acts as the city's western boundary; across the river are the Zhiguli Mountains, after which the local beer (Zhigulyovskoye) is named. - Mod.CP]

Cases of "mouse fever" have been frequent in Primorye residents this year [2013].

Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome [HFRS] is referred to colloquially as "mouse fever" because rodents are the principal vector. The human population usually becomes infected by inhaling dust in buildings where rodents are present.

Cases of HFRS in the human population fluctuate in accordance with expansion and contraction of the rodent population. Currently, the number of cases of HFRS is increasing. Last year [2012], the frequency of cases was 1.9 per 100 000 population, whereas this year [2013], it has risen to 3 per 100 000 population.

Cases of HFRS for the 1st 10 months of 2013 were recorded in 13 territories of the region. The largest number of cases -- 38 in total -- were recorded in Vladivostok.

[Primorye, in Primorsky Krai, is also designated Primorskiy Maritime Territory, located between the Sea of Japan (East Sea) to the east and northeastern China (formerly Manchuria) to the west. It is the most southerly of the Russian Far Eastern territories.

Hemorrhagic fever with renal failure syndrome (HFRS) occurs mainly in Europe and Asia and is characterized by fever and renal failure associated with hemorrhagic manifestations. Hemorrhagic fever with renal failure syndrome is caused by an airborne contact with secretions from rodent hosts infected with the group of viruses belonging to the genus _Hantavirus_ of the family _Bunyaviridae_. In Europe, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome is caused by hantaviruses: Puumala virus (PUUV), carried by the bank vole (_Myodes glareolus_); Dobrava virus (DOBV), carried by the mouse (_Apodemus flavicollis_); and Saaremaa virus (SAAV), carried by the striped field mouse (_Apodemus agrarius_). Other viruses in the _Bunyaviridae_ family include Seoul virus and Tala virus. - Mod.CP
