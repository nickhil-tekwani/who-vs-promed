Large volumes of pooling water from the Amazon River set in motion a chain of events that led to the deaths of 223 horses in Brazil in 2011 and 2012, a study suggests.

The plentiful water from the Amazon during the rainy season on the eastern part of Maraja Island pooled in the fields which, together with hot and humid conditions, created conditions favorable to the rise of blood-sucking insects.

These insects acted as a vector to transmit _Trypanosoma evansi_, a dangerous protozoan, to the horses.

Researchers from Universidade Federal do Para, writing in the journal Ciancia Rural, reported on the 2 outbreaks of the protozoal infection in the municipality of Chaves, which lies on Maraja Island, in Brazil's Para State. Maraja Island is located at the mouth of the Amazon.

The 1st outbreak occurred in April 2011 at a farm with 147 horses. Of these, 47 got sick, and 40 died.

The 2nd outbreak occurred in May the following year [2012] and involved 9 properties. Of a total of 679 horses, 209 got sick, and 183 died.

Before the 2 outbreaks, the disease had not been reported in Para state since 1941.

The main clinical signs observed in these horses were weight loss, abdominal swelling, toe dragging, and loss of pelvic muscle condition, Valaria Duarte Cerqueira and her colleagues reported.

Necropsies were performed on 2 horses, one from each outbreak. Major changes were not seen in the horse from the 1st outbreak. However, the horse from the 2nd outbreak exhibited emaciation, pallor and jaundice, as well as an enlarged spleen with prominent white pulp at the cut surface.

The researchers noted that studies had shown an apparent resurgence of infections by _T. evansi_ in horses in Brazil, with reports in the mid-west, southern, and northern regions of the country.

The disease affects various domestic and wild mammals, such as horses, bovines, buffalo, dogs, rabbits, armadillo, coati and capybaras.

The disease is known in Brazil as "surra," "derrengadera," or "mal das cadeiras," all popular terms that refer to a problem in the hind limbs and hips.

_T. evansi_ is present in nearly all continents, American, Asian, Oceania, African and in Europe. South America has areas considered enzootic for this parasite.

Transmission occurs through blood-sucking vectors, especially tabanids and flies of the genus _Stomoxys_ sp, blood-drinking bats, and, probably ticks and leaches.

In South America, wild animals, especially capybaras and ring-tailed coatis, are considered important _T. evansi_ reservoirs. Capybaras are often implicated as the source of infection in horses during outbreaks.

The authors noted that, in the 2 outbreaks, more cases occurred at the end of the rainy season, probably owing to a larger vector population during this period. The rainy season in Maraja Island is between January and June, with blood-sucking insects peaking at the end of July, when the drought period begins.

In addition, the farm owners in this study reported a large number of leaches during the rainy season, which could increase the risk of _T. evansi_ transmission since they could be vectors and reservoirs of the protozoan.

"The possibility that wild animals, such as capybaras, coatis, and small wild rodents, act as a source of infection in trypanosomiasis cases in Maraja Island is very plausible," they wrote.

Farmers related that before the prohibition of capybara hunting, the population of this big rodent was controlled, and they did not observe the disease in horses or capybaras.

The disease outbreaks had a major economic impact on horse breeding in the region, the researchers reported. The island has a large horse population, and their use for the management of cattle and buffalo was important.

In this regard, an immunosuppressive disease, like trypanosomiasis, can dramatically compromise the local economy. The disease caused by _T. evansi_ should be considered in the differential diagnosis of other neurological syndromes in horses, particularly on the Island of Maraja, Para.

[This article implicates the capybaras as a reservoir for the protozoan, which is quite possible and likely. However, leeches sounded a bit speculative, but logically, it makes sense.

Surra (_Trypanosoma evansi_ infection) is usually transmitted by other biting flies that are found within and outside tsetse fly areas. It occurs in North Africa, the Middle East, Asia, the Far East, and Central and South America. The distribution of _T evansi_ in Africa extends into the tsetse areas, where differentiation from _T brucei_ is difficult. It is essentially a disease of camels and horses, but all domestic animals are susceptible. The disease can be fatal, particularly in camels, horses, and dogs. _T evansi_ in other animals appears to be nonpathogenic, and these animals serve as reservoirs of infection.

Transmission is primarily by biting flies, probably resulting from interrupted feedings. A few wild animals are susceptible to infection and may serve as reservoirs.

_T. vivax_, another of the trypanosomes, has been found in several areas in South America. This particular trypanosome has been shown to infect cattle, sheep, goats, camels, horses and various wild animals.

Most tsetse transmission is cyclic and begins when blood from a trypanosome-infected animal is ingested by the fly. The trypanosome alters its surface coat, multiplies in the fly, then alters its surface coat again, and becomes infective. _T brucei_ spp migrate within the tsetse from the gut and eventually to the salivary glands; the cycle for _T congolense_ stops at the hypopharynx, and the salivary glands are not invaded; the entire cycle for _T vivax_ occurs in the proboscis. Therefore, the location within the tsetse can be useful in identifying the parasite species. The animal-infective form in the tsetse salivary gland is referred to as the metacyclic form. The life cycle in the tsetse may be as short as one week with _T vivax_ or extend to a few weeks for _T brucei_ spp.

Tsetse flies (genus _Glossina_) are restricted to Africa from about latitude 15oN to 29oS. The 3 main species inhabit relatively distinct environments: _G morsitans_ usually is found in savanna country, _G palpalis_ prefers areas around rivers and lakes, and _G fusca_ lives in high forest areas. All 3 species transmit trypanosomes, and all feed on various mammals.

Mechanical transmission can occur through tsetse or other biting flies. In the case of _T vivax_, _Tabanus_ spp and other biting flies seem to be the primary mechanical vectors outside tsetse-endemic areas, as in Central and South America. Mechanical transmission requires only that blood containing infectious trypanosomes be transferred by bite from one animal to another.

Infected tsetse inoculate metacyclic trypanosomes into the skin of animals, where the trypanosomes reside for a few days and cause localized inflammation (chancres). They enter the lymph and lymph nodes, then the bloodstream, where they divide rapidly by binary fission. In _T congolense_ infection, the organisms attach to endothelial cells and localize in capillaries and small blood vessels. _T brucei_ species and _T vivax_ invade tissues and cause tissue damage in several organs.

The immune response is vigorous, and immune complexes cause inflammation, which contributes to fever and other signs and lesions of the disease. Antibodies against the surface-coat glycoproteins kill the trypanosomes. However, trypanosomes have a large family of genes that code for variable surface-coat glycoproteins that are switched in response to the antibody response, evading immunity. This antigenic variation results in persistence of the organism. Antigenic variation has prevented development of a protective vaccine and permits reinfections when animals are exposed to a new antigenic type.

Severity of disease varies with species and age of the animal infected and the species of trypanosome involved. The incubation period is usually 1-4 weeks. The primary clinical signs are intermittent fever, anemia, and weight loss. Cattle usually have a chronic course with high mortality, especially if there is poor nutrition or other stress factors. Ruminants may gradually recover if the number of infected tsetse flies is low; however, stress results in relapse.

Necropsy findings vary and are nonspecific. In acute, fatal cases, extensive petechiation of the serosal membranes, especially in the peritoneal cavity, may occur. Also, the lymph nodes and spleen are usually swollen. In chronic cases, swollen lymph nodes, serous atrophy of fat, and anemia are seen.

A presumptive diagnosis is based on finding an anemic animal in poor condition in an endemic area. Confirmation depends on demonstrating trypanosomes in stained blood smears or wet mounts. The most sensitive rapid method is to examine a wet mount of the buffy coat area of a PCV tube after centrifugation, looking for motile parasites. Other infections that cause anemia and weight loss, such as babesiosis, anaplasmosis, theileriosis, and haemonchosis, should be excluded by examining a stained blood smear.

Various serologic tests measure antibody to trypanosomes, but their use is more suitable for herd and area screening than for individual diagnosis. Rapid agglutination tests to detect circulating trypanosome species-specific antigens in peripheral blood are available for both individual and herd diagnosis, although their reliability remains varied. Molecular techniques for trypanosome detection and differentiation have been developed, but they are not generally available for routine field use.

There are a number of different agents for treating the disease. Some may be curative, and some may lend some prevention.
