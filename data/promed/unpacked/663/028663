DIOXIN, FISH - SWEDEN: EXPORTED CONTAMINATED FISH

Since 2002, Swedish authorities are required by law to inform consumers about dangerous dioxins found in salmon. Exporting Baltic Sea salmon to other EU member states was also banned at the time.

Yet an episode of Sveriges Television's (SVT) investigative news programme Uppdrag granskning set to air on Wednesday [8 May 2013] night reveals that the salmon is still being shipped out to EU consumers.

When sold across Europe, health authorities in the recipient countries are not required to publish information about how much of the fish a consumer can eat without potential health implications.

"The difference when compared to the horse-meat scandal is that this fish has long-term effects on people's health, which makes it a serious issue," Pontus Elvingsson, at the National Food Agency (Livsmedelsverket), told SVT.

The 2002 laws came about after the EU introduced rules on how much dioxin is permissible in different foods. Dioxins have been linked to cancer, and research shows the toxin may affect human reproduction. The EU, however, issued an exemption to Sweden as long as its authorities made an effort to inform the public about potential health risks.

One such guideline was to warn pregnant women and children from eating Baltic Sea salmon more than twice or 3 times a year.

Yet, while restrictions are in place, fishermen have continued to pull up bountiful catches of salmon from the Baltic Sea. In 2012, an estimated 250 tonnes of salmon were fished in Sweden alone, prompting SVT reporters to ask where the surplus was ending up after Swedish consumers had had their share.

SVT found that 2 Swedish whole-salers had been reported to the authorities and that a stash of invoices proved that the salmon was being illegally exported to France and Denmark. The supply chain from there meant the fish would likely end up across the continent, both in supermarket aisles and on restaurant plates.

Wednesday's [8 May 2013] television show aired an interview with an employee at one of the 2 Swedish firms that have now been reported to the authorities. The man said the company had discussed whether the exporting was legal or not. "But management said we'd keep selling and run the risk," the man reportedly told SVT.

While a representative from one of their French buyers said the company ordered tests on the fish it brought in to France, Elvingsson at the Swedish National Food Agency said thorough analyses were both costly and time consuming, making him doubt the French claim. "It sounds highly improbable," he told SVT.

It is not the 1st time suspicions of illegal exports have been raised with the authorities; 2 years ago, the Association of Leisure Fishers (Sportfiskarna) reported that a large catch of Baltic Sea salmon had been sold at auction in Gothenburg.

Secretary-General Stefan Nystrom on Wednesday [8 May 2013] said the association's information had not been dealt with properly at the time. "We raised the alarm with the Rural Affairs Ministry, the National Food Agency and with the municipality, but they brushed it off," Nystrom said. "Now we're talking about gigantic volumes of fish that is dangerous to eat. Dioxin isn't something to take lightly; it's one of the most dangerous poisons."

[The horse meat scandal was more than mislabeled meat. There were drugs in the horsemeat that could harm human health as well.

The article does not tell us what the levels are or with which dioxins the fish are contaminated. One has to realize that dose exposure makes the toxin, so knowing the dose as well as the time are important to calculate the levels in the fish. There is good scientific literature on animal feed (being fed to [farmed] fish) and human food regarding dosage and dioxin. There is a growing body of evidence that extremely low levels may not cause cancer. There is much controversy surrounding dioxin and its dangers vs. possible benefits. The controversy has raged since the early 1970's and is likely to continue. Also, where there are dioxins, one should also be testing for PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls).

Dioxin is a catch-all term for a 6-member ring [chemical] where oxygen has been substituted for 2 of the carbon atoms. This general structure gives rise to a number of related compounds all having that 6-member ring with oxygen substitutions. Therefore, there are a group of chemicals with dioxin-like activity. Those chemicals include:

- 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (2,37,8-TCDD). This is generally regarded as a base or benchmark for assessment of the relative toxicity of other dioxin-like compounds. It may be the most potent of dioxin-like compounds, and, therefore, other chemicals' toxicity may be measured against it.

- Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB). This chemical grouping is generally associated with electrical transformers and should be of concern in this case. This group of compounds are related structurally to PCDD and PCDF, which also have dioxin-like activity.

- Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDD) and Polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDF) are both known as furan derivatives because of a common chemical structure within the molecule and, therefore, are similar in their toxicities.

- Dibenzofurans are also a component and parent compound of PCDD and PCDF and share a dioxin-like toxicity with these other compounds.

Dioxins are relatively omnipresent in the [world]. They are very persistent chemicals. Almost everyone has some minor level of these classes of compounds or what is called a background level of these toxins. Most human exposure is through food. These chemicals accumulate in the fatty tissues of animals and humans. Therefore, humans are exposed through consumption of meat, eggs, dairy and dairy products, fish and shellfish.

Dioxins are highly toxic. They can be incorporated at the fetal development stages and cause developmental problems. They may have an interfering affect on the immunological and hormonal systems and be responsible for some cancers.

There are a host of regulations and literature on this topic. Therefore, opinions and literature supporting one or the other position are not likely to be posted on ProMED-mail. - Mod.TG]
