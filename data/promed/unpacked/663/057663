Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD), commonly known as monkey fever, has returned to Sattari with detection of 3 cases at the Manipal Centre for Virus Research based at Valpoi community health centre, in the last 3 weeks. Monkey fever has been present in Sattari taluka during the past 3 years.

When contacted, CHC [Community Health Centre] health official Dr Gajanan Naik confirmed that 3 female patients from Sattari tested positive, and all have recovered after treatment at Valpoi CHC and have been discharged. According to a source, 2 infected patients are from Velguem, while one is from Budruk-Karmali village. All 3 were bitten by ticks as they were working in a cashew plantation in a forest area. However, the incidence is less than in 2016 when 3 deaths and 276 cases were reported. Last season, altogether 88 patients were tested positive, and no deaths were recorded.

"In the last 2 years, the number of positive patients has come down, as we have intensified advocacy programmes in all affected villages of Sattari in our jurisdiction, and till now we have vaccinated 10 583 villagers by organising special vaccination drives," said Naik, who further said that they administer KFD vaccine at Valpoi CHC every Tuesday and Friday. "We have also distributed some DMP [dimethylphthalate] tick repellent oils in a few villages of Sattari, and a new stock of oil will be arriving soon, which we will distribute in all villages," he further stated.

[Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD), also known as monkey fever, is caused by the Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV), a member of the genus _Flavivirus_ belonging to the family _Flaviviridae_.

KFDV was 1st isolated from sick monkeys captured in Kyasanur Forest, Shimoga district, Karnataka state in 1957; hence its name. KFD symptoms include sudden onset of chills, fever, and headache. Severe muscle pain with vomiting, gastrointestinal symptoms and bleeding problems may occur 3-4 days after initial symptom onset. Abnormally low blood pressure and low platelet, red blood cell, and white blood cell counts may ensue. Some patients recover without complication 1-2 weeks after symptom onset. However, in 10-20 per cent of patients, a 2nd wave of symptoms begins at the beginning of the 3rd week. These symptoms include fever and signs of neurological manifestations, such as severe headache, mental disturbances, tremors, and vision deficits.

KFD has an estimated case fatality rate between 3 and 5 per cent. People with recreational or occupational exposure to rural or outdoor settings such as hunters, herders, forest workers, and farmers are at risk of infection by contact with infected ticks in the affected areas. Cases are usually reported during the dry season (November-June).

Diagnosis can be done by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) or virus isolation from blood in the early stage of illness or by enzyme-linked immunosorbent serologic assay (ELISA) in the later stage. There is no specific treatment for KFD, but early hospitalization and supportive therapy such as maintenance of hydration and the usual precautions for patients with bleeding disorders are important in reducing mortality. Vaccination, tick control measures and personal protective measures against tick bite are the key measures to prevent KFD in endemic areas (https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/kyasanur/pdf/factsheet.pdf).

Prophylaxis by vaccination, as well as preventive measures like protective clothing, tick control, and mosquito control are advised. The vaccine for KFDV consists of formalin-inactivated KFDV. The vaccine has a 62.4 per cent effectiveness rate for individuals who receive 2 doses. For individuals who receive an additional dose, the effectiveness increases to 82.9 per cent [Kasabi GS, Murhekar MV, Sandhya VK, et al. Coverage and effectiveness of Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) vaccine in Karnataka, South India, 2005-10. PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2013;7(1):e2025; available at: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3554520/].

Vaccination with formalin-inactivated tissue-culture vaccine has been the primary strategy for controlling KFD. The strategy involves mass vaccination in areas reporting KFD activity (that is, laboratory evidence of KFD virus [KFDV] in monkeys, humans, or ticks) and in villages within a 5-km radius of such areas [Directorate of Health and Family Welfare Services, Government of Karnataka, 2005 manual on Kyasanur Forest disease; unpub. data]. Two vaccine doses are administered at least one month apart to persons 7-65 years of age. Vaccine-induced immunity is short-lived, so the 1st booster dose of vaccine is recommended within 6-9 months after primary vaccination; thereafter, annual booster doses are recommended for 5 years after the last confirmed case in the area https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/21/1/14-1227_article. - Mod.UBA
