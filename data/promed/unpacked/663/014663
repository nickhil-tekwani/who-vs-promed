In a recently released report, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources announced that of 10 bass sampled from the Pocomoke River, 6 tested positive for the virus.

"We hadn't tested for it yet in the Pocomoke River, so over the past year we took some samples, and 6 of the 10 individual fish we sampled had largemouth bass virus (LMBV)," said Joseph Love, the tidal bass manager for Maryland's Department of Natural Resource.

"It's not the 1st time we have found it in Maryland. But we are trying to report it as we sample rivers and determine its occurrence, its frequency and how many individuals in our sample have it."

Mr. Love said his department has found LMBV in the Potomac River, as well as the Patuxent, the Susquehanna, the Northeast and the Choptank rivers. It has also observed fish with the disease in other reservoirs around the state.

"It is not an uncommon virus, and it can be transmitted by many species of fish," Mr. Love told the newspaper. "It's a waterborne virus, so it can just exist in the water. It's a pretty tough pathogen."

Anglers might suspect a fish has LMBV because it causes the bass to swim "lazily" and "haphazardly" near the surface of the water.

[LMBV (family Iridoviridae) is a pathogen that has become widely distributed throughout the southeastern and midwestern United States, and is known to contribute to high morbidity and mortality in wild largemouth bass (_Micropterus salmoides_; see picture at http://www.fcps.edu/islandcreekes/ecology/Fish/Largemouth%20Bass/M_salmodies.jpg).

Adult fish are particularly susceptible. Fish become infected either through the water or by consuming infected prey. Infected fish lose equilibrium and tend to float near the surface. A typical finding at a post-mortem exam is a characteristically enlarged or reddened swim bladders. The virus has been associated with large-scale largemouth bass fish kills, particularly at warmer water temperatures. The fish that recover from the viral infection usually become chronic carriers of the virus. This finding does not appear to be associated with fish die-offs.
