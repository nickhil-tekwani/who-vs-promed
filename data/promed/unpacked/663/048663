WHO Warns of Possible Ebola Outbreak in Congo DR
------------------------------------------------
2 people have died in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) after
displaying symptoms similar to those caused by the deadly Ebola
virus, the World Health Organization reported.
A rickshaw driver and one of his passengers died in Bumba, 500 km
(about 300 miles) north of Mbandaka, after suffering hemorrhagic
fever, the WHO announced on Tue 14 Mar 2006.
The WHO's Head of Epidemiology in the DRC, Florent Ekwanza, said a
3rd person, the wife of the driver, had "presented with the same
symptoms as her husband and is in the care of Bumba general hospital,
where WHO teams were dispatched." Swabs taken from the bodies of the
2 dead victims "will be sent to South Africa to be tested for Ebola,"
he added.
Ebola, one of the world's most feared and contagious diseases, causes
raging fever and massive hemorrhaging. In 60-90 percent of cases,
death follows within a few days.
2 previous outbreaks in the former Zaire, one in 1976 and one in
1995, killed around 525 people, according to health ministry figures.
The virus, transported in infected blood, semen and possibly urine
and respiratory droplets, takes 3 weeks to incubate.

[Ebola virus was 1st identified in a western equatorial province of
Sudan and in a nearby region of Zaire (now Democratic Republic of the
Congo) in 1976, after significant epidemics in Yambuku, northern
Zaire, and Nzara, southern Sudan. Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF) is
one of the most virulent viral diseases known to humankind, causing
death in 50-90 percent of all clinically ill cases. Several different
species of Ebola virus have been identified.

Bumba, together with a comprehensive description of the country and
its history, can be viewed at

It should be noted that the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(formerly Zaire) and the Congo Republic are adjacent but separate
countries. - Mod.CP]
