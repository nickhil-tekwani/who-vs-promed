Anthrax kills 25 bison on Turner's Flying D
-------------------------------------------
An outbreak of the infectious disease anthrax has killed 25 domestic
bison on Ted Turner's Flying D Ranch near the mouth of the Gallatin
Canyon, Montana Department of Livestock officials said Wednesday [30
Jul 2008].

"Laboratory tests confirmed anthrax late this morning," state
veterinarian Dr. Marty Zaluski said. "The outbreak has been contained
to a single, fully enclosed pasture, and we are aggressively
addressing the situation with full cooperation of the landowner." The
affected area has been quarantined.

"Anthrax can pop up any place at any time, but this outbreak was in a
remote, well-contained area," Zaluski said. "We're fortunate that the
landowner recognized the disease early and took the appropriate
action."

Turner, the media mogul who raises domestic bison on the ranch in the
foothills of the Spanish Peaks, said Wednesday he and his ranch
managers were working with state livestock officials "and following
their protocol guidelines to control the disease."

"I'm not the 1st rancher to deal with an anthrax outbreak, and
certainly not the last," he said. "Other outbreaks have been
successfully managed throughout the U.S. and Canada, and I am
confident we will do the same."

Montana has not had a reported case of human anthrax since 1961.

"Vaccination for livestock in the area is always an option, but we're
not recommending it at this time," Zaluski said.

[I suspect that Dr. Zaluski might be being over optimistic while
trying to calm Montanan nerves. With this number of animals dying the
local horseflies will have had ample opportunity to feed on the sick,
moribund and dead and thus load up their mouthparts with contaminated
blood and spores. The usual threshold number for local spread is 4-7
dead cows, so 25 is way over the odds. As female tabanids can easy
fly 8 kms [5 miles] between blood snacks, spread to neighbouring
herds of cattle is always possible and is seen not infrequently, cf
the starting situations in South and North Dakota in 2005 and in
northern Saskatchewan in 2006. Herds within 10 miles of these
affected bison should be very strongly recommended to get their stock
vaccinated ASAP if not sooner. - Mod.MHJ]
