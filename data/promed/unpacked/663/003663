Ohio Department of Agriculture director Robert Boggs announced
Wednesday [7 Jul 2010] that preliminary tests performed by the
department's Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory revealed a positive
result for bovine tuberculosis in a Paulding County dairy herd. There
is no known human illness associated with this occurrence.

The herd was found positive after routine tuberculosis testing by the
department. The herd was depopulated, and the department is currently
conducting a trace-in and trace-out investigation to determine if
other livestock may be affected.

"We are currently working with our state and federal partners on this
matter to take the necessary steps to identify the origin of the
affected cattle," said Boggs. "This is yet another example of how the
Ohio Department of Agriculture works daily to assure the safety of
Ohio consumers and livestock."

Tuberculosis is a disease caused by bacteria which affect the
respiratory system. Bovine tuberculosis, also known as cattle TB, is
an infectious form of tuberculosis as it infects most warm-blooded
animals, including humans. It can manifest in livestock as a chronic,
debilitating disease, and it may take years to develop bovine
tuberculosis lesions in the lungs.

Airborne exposure from coughing and sneezing is considered to be the
most frequent way in which bovine tuberculosis is spread, but it can
also occur through consumption of contaminated water, feed, or
unpasteurized milk.

[Bovine tuberculosis (TB) is caused by _Mycobacterium bovis_. While
there are other _Mycobacterium_ spp, _M. bovis_ and _M. tuberculosis_
are among the most important, as these tend to move between animals and people.

Disease caused by mycobacteria often develop very slowly and may take
months to years to develop. These bacteria grow very slowly and only
replicate every 12-20 hours. While the pathogenic species (those
which can cause disease) such as _M. tuberculosis_ and _M. bovis_ can
infect a human or an animal, often the individual does not know that
he has been infected. In humans, those infected but without active
disease can be treated to prevent disease from occurring. To prevent
other animals from being infected, a diseased animal must be culled
from the herd.

The disease primarily affects the respiratory tract but can also
spread to other parts of the body. The primary route of transmission
is the exchange of respiratory secretions between infected and
uninfected animals. This can be achieved through nose-to-nose contact
or by the inhalation of aerosol droplets that have been exhaled by an
infected animal. Animals may also become infected with _M. bovis_ by
ingesting the bacteria. This could occur by ingesting feeds that have
been contaminated with _M. bovis_ by other infected animals.
Carnivores may become infected with bovine TB by eating infected carcasses.

Various factors affect the efficiency in which _M. bovis_ is spread
within a cattle herd. The number of infected animals shedding the
organism, as well as the number of susceptible animals present within
a herd can have an impact on the transmission of the bacteria. For
example, the more animals within a herd shedding _M. bovis_, the
greater the chance of an uninfected animal coming into contact with
an infected animal. The animal density of a herd also influences the
efficiency of _M. bovis_ transmission. Transmission of _M. bovis_
among animals housed in confinement facilities may be greater because
of close contact. Cattle infected with bovine TB may shed bacteria in
their feces, urine, and milk, but these are felt to be a minor source
of bacterial transmission.

Environmental contamination with _M. bovis_ may play a role in the
spread of bovine TB. Survival of _M. bovis_ in the environment is
primarily affected by exposure to sunlight. Reports on the length of
survival of _M. bovis_ vary from 18-332 days at temperatures ranging
from 54-75 deg F (12-24 deg C). Under laboratory conditions, _M.
bovis_ has been isolated for up to 8 weeks from various feeds kept at
75 deg F (24 deg C) and 14 weeks from various feeds kept at 32 deg F
(0 deg C). Under field conditions, however, it is difficult to
isolate _M. bovis_ from pastures grazed by animals known to be
infected with bovine TB.

Sadly, this disease still keeps popping up in the animal herds.
Researchers need to find a more reliable test. While the Bovigam [an
in vitro laboratory test for the diagnosis of bovine TB in cattle,
sheep, goats, buffalo, bison, and other bovidae] has promise, it is
not an end-all to testing.
