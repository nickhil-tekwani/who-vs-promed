Viruses associated with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in Bolivia
----------------------------------------------------------------
Dr CJ Peters (<cjpeters@utmb.edu>) has alerted me to the fact that my
moderator's comment accompanying the recent ProMED-mail post describing a
suspected case of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in Bolivia (reference
below) was deficient in certain respects. My comment was intended merely to
indicate that the identification of Andes virus as the etiological agent,
although probable, was preliminary. In support of this statement I cited
the existence of another hantavirus, Rio Mamore virus, known to be present
in Bolivia although not so far associated with HPS.
In fact, at least 2 hantaviruses in addition to Andes virus have been
associated with HPS in Bolivia. In a paper published in 1997 (Laguna Negra
virus associated with HPS in western Paraguay and Bolivia. Johnson AM,
Bowen MD, Ksiazek TG, Williams RJ, Bryan RT, Mills JN, et al. Virology
1997; 238(1): 115-27) genetic analysis revealed a newly discovered
hantavirus, Laguna Negra (LN) virus, to be associated with a large outbreak
of HPS in Paraguay. A direct genetic link between the virus detected in the
HPS cases and in _Calomys laucha_ rodents, implicated the latter as the
primary rodent reservoir for LN virus in Paraguay. Virus isolates obtained
from two _C. laucha_, indeed, represented the first successful isolation of
a pathogenic South American hantavirus. Analysis of the prototype LN virus
entire S and M and partial L segment nucleotide and deduced amino acid
sequences showed that this virus is unique among the Sigmodontinae-borne
clade of hantaviruses. Analysis of polymerase chain reaction fragments
amplified from a serum sample from a Chilean HPS patient, who had recently
traveled extensively in Bolivia (where _C. laucha_ rodents are known to
occur), revealed an LN virus variant that was about 15 per cent different
at the nucleotide level and identical at the deduced amino acid level
relative to the Paraguayan LN virus. These data indicated that LN virus may
cause HPS in several countries in this geographic region.
More recently, investigation of two suspected HPS cases occurring in
Bolivia in May and July 2000 was described in the April issue of Emerging
Infectious Diseases (Andes virus and first case report of Bermejo virus
causing fatal pulmonary syndrome. Padula P, Della Valle MG, Alai MG,
Cortada P, Villagra M, Gianella A. Emerg Infect Dis 2002; 8(4): 437-9).
Clot RNAs from the two patients were subjected to reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and sequencing,
and it was established that one HPS case was associated with infection with
Bermejo virus and the other with Andes virus (Nort lineage). Both these
viruses are present in _Oligoryzomys_ species rodents. This was the first
report of molecular identification of HPS associated with Bermejo virus.
Although HPS was discovered in North America in 1993, subsequent
investigations have revealed that the disease is more prevalent in South
America, where a greater number of cases and a greater diversity of
HPS-associated hantaviruses have been detected. The phylogeny of these
viruses is complex and their taxonomy is likely to undergo revision as
knowledge accumulates.
