Vaccination against avian flu of domestic birds kept in small farms
will begin in the Moscow region on Monday [19 Feb 2007]. More than a
million vaccines were brought for a massive vaccination [campaign] in
the region, acting Governor of the Moscow region Alexei Panteleyev
told Itar-Tass.
"This work is usually done twice a year -- in spring and autumn--,
but as bird flu cases were exposed we decided to begin this procedure
ahead of time," Panteleyev emphasized. He also noted that [to date] 5
bird flu [outbreaks] have been registered in the Moscow region: in
the Domodedovo (south-east), Taldom (north), Podolsk (south),
Naro-Fominsk (south-west) districts, and in Zvenigorod (west). [These
locations can be identified in the map at:

\>]. "In all cases people bought poultry for their small farms at the
Moscow poultry market," the acting governor recalled.
The Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Supervision also
confirmed the information about purchases of the bird flu-infected
poultry in Moscow. "Experts have drawn conclusions that a bird flu
outbreak in these districts was caused by the infected poultry bought
at the Moscow poultry market," chief press officer of the Russian
veterinary service, Alexei Alekseyenko, pointed out.
Meanwhile, the Moscow regional authorities stated that there is no
danger for people. [A source in the regional administration stated
that all birds kept at small farms had been immediately slaughtered
in a humane way and incinerated.] The source stressed that all people
who were in contact with sick birds are under the constant
supervision of doctors. Quarantine was imposed in settlements, [and
measures implemented include] the disinfection of all vehicles going
out of the region and a ban on deliveries of any poultry meat
products and even fodder from the region.
Bird flu cases in the Moscow region also pose no threat to poultry
plants in the region and their products. "The condition of poultry is
[continuously] checked at each poultry plant, the access of people to
production facilities is restricted, and wildfowl, which may land at
poultry plants, is being shot down," the source said.

[Shooting down "wildfowl, which may land at poultry plants", needs to
be confirmed and clarified. Has this become a part of Russia's avian
influenza prevention programme? In case it is selectively applied,
which criteria are adopted? Are shot birds being tested? Further
information will be appreciated.
In another news-wire [of the same news agency], the isolate was
informed to be H5N1; see report at
<http://www.itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=11263791&PageNum=0>.
Spread of the virus through animal and food markets may be prevented
by appropriate biosecurity, including animal movement and trade
restrictions. Additional measures -- such as the closure of markets
for at least one day a week, accompanied by cleansing and
disinfection, as successfully applied in Hong Kong -- deserve
consideration.- Mod.AS]

The rules of poultry keeping have been toughened in Russia's Far
Eastern Primorsky (Maritime) territory due to the threat of a bird
flu outbreak. The agriculture and food department of the Primorsky
territory administration told Itar-Tass that outdoor run of barnyard
fowl and keeping of wild fowl at homesteads has been strictly
prohibited. [A map of the Primorsky territory is available at:
<http://map.rin.ru/maps_e/Primorsk.gif >. - Mod.AS].
Meanwhile, mass vaccination of birds is continuing. As many as 95 000
chickens, ducks, geese, and turkeys have been inoculated out of a
total of 800 000. Vaccination has been completed at private aviaries
in 16 municipalities of the territory, including in the cities of
Ussuriisk, Spassk, and Dalnerechensk. All poultry will be vaccinated
in the [near future] in the Chernigovsk, Khorolsk, Khasan, and
Khankai districts, and in Artem. These territories are considered a
"dangerous zone" because [they are a nesting area for migrating birds.]
Vaccination of poultry in the Primorsky territory is being carried
out 2 months earlier than in 2006. This is caused by a warm winter,
the possibility of an earlier return of migrating birds from their
wintering places, and the cases of bird flu in China, South Korea, and Japan.
