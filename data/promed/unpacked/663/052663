[Based on a 6 Jun 2017 press release from Luxembourg's Ministry of Agriculture "a 4th outbreak of bird flu was confirmed in a poultry farm in Rollingen/Mersch. All poultry present on the premises have been euthanized" (see ProMED-mail posting 20170606.5088082).

However, this current OIE report mentions that "selective killing and disposal" of the affected poultry population was done. In addition, the quantitative information that was provided does not identify the size of the susceptible population. We only know that 76 birds died, and 787 were killed.

Given that HPAI has not been reported in the country since 1956, and the fact that the disease can spread rapidly, it would be of interest to know whether the 787 birds that were killed represented all birds that were affected in these 4 outbreaks or whether in fact, if "selectively" culled, there are many other birds that are susceptible that were not depopulated.

The report further indicates that the origin of infection was the introduction of new live animals. It would be important to learn where these "new live animals" came from and what exposure they may have had prior to being introduced into the flock that became infected. - Mod.CRD
