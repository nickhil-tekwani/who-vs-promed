The Provincial Medical Officer of Health for North Eastern Province
has reported 11 deaths in Garissa District in North Eastern Province
of Kenya is possibly due to a viral hemorrhagic fever.
The 1st death was reported on 17 Dec 2006. The patient was admitted
to the Provincial General Hospital in Garissa and died within a few
hours of admission. The patient was from Fafi division of Garissa
District. Fafi Division is 40 kilometers from Garissa town. Other
deaths have been reported from Shanta Abak which is 140 km north of
Garissa, Shell Gulliet and Korakora.
Most deaths occurred outside the hospital. The clinical features were
fever, headache, vomiting blood, jaundice and most deaths occurred
within 24-72 hours of onset of symptoms. All the affected individuals
were aged 20-30 years and were cattle herdsmen. Investigations were
negative for malaria, Brucella, HBsAg and typhoid. There were reports
of cows and goats dying in Fafi division. The cattle presented with
fever, bloody diarrhea and skin rashes.
The area has been affected by the recent floods due to heavy rains
and most parts of the district are inaccessible by road. There is an
increase of mosquitoes in the area and the number of malaria cases
has increased in the last 2 weeks. Samples from patients have been
taken to KEMRI (Kenya Medical Research Institute) in Nairobi for
further serological tests.

[Further information is sought concerning the extent and etiology of
this outbreak of suspected viral hemorrhagic fever affecting cattle
and cattle-herders in the northeastern region of Kenya around
Garissa. Northeastern Kenya has recently been affected by severe
flooding. The Red Cross reported on 20 Dec 2006
(<http://www.news24.com/News24/Africa/News/0,,2-11-1447_2047173,00.html>)
that 118 people have died in flood-related incidents across the
country since unusually heavy seasonal rains began pounding the
country in late October. The new Red Cross figure brought to at
least 318 the total number of people killed by floods in Ethiopia,
Kenya and Somalia, all of which had been hit by torrential rains
expected to continue into January. Some deaths were due to
consumption of chlorinated water.
Hemorrhagic fevers known to occur in this region include Rift valley
fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever. Any of these viruses or
another unknown agent could be responsible for this outbreak might
could be considered as candidates. Outbreaks of Rift Valley fever
have been associated with the aftermath of flooding and abundance of
mosquitoes, but mortality is moderate to low. Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever virus causes outbreaks of lethal human disease and
the virus multiplies prolifically in domestic animals but is not
associated with illness. Outbreaks of disease caused by the highly
lethal filoviruses (Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus) have been restricted
so far to primates and bats.
Further information is awaited, in particular, confirmation that the
outbreak can be attributed to viral infection.

[The combination of a haemorrhagic disease in humans with the
described disease in livestock is indeed highly indicative of Rift
valley fever, a disease initially described at the beginning of the
previous century in Kenya, and since known to occur in epizootics
once in 10 - 15 years, mainly following periods of excessive rains.
RVF may affect many animal species; its primary amplifying hosts are
sheep and cattle. The clinical signs vary with the age. In endemic
regions, it can be recognized by the high mortality in newborn
animals and abortions in adults; its mortality rate may reach 90 to
100 percent in neonates of sheep, and 10 to 70 percent in young
calves. The symptoms in adult sheep may include fever, a mucopurulent
nasal discharge (sometimes bloodstained), hemorrhagic or
foul-smelling diarrhea, vomiting, jaundice, abortion and an unsteady
gait. In adult cattle, fever, anorexia, weakness, excessive
salivation, fetid diarrhea, abortion and decreased milk production
may be seen. Similar but milder infections occur in goats. Infection
from animal to man may be direct, by exposure of humans to infected
material (typical cases will be the aerosol spread of blood particles
during slaughter, handling of aborted foeti, etc). The inderect route
will be by insect vectors, mainly mosquitoes. - Mod. AS]
[There was a major outbreak of RVF in Garissa in December 1997 --
there's a review of the outbreak in Emerging Infectious Diseases
<http://0-www.cdc.gov.mill1.sjlibrary.org/ncidod/EID/vol8no2/01-0023.htm>
Same location, same time of year, also associated with flooding and
with a higher incidence in the nomadic herdsmen in the area. There
was also a concurrent epizootic at the same time, with a high
incidence of loss of sheep and goats. There was also mention of
other livestock diseases that may have contributed to illness among
the livestock: "Human suffering from RVFV is compounded by the loss
of domestic animals. Livestock owners reported losses of
approximately 70% of their animals, with the greatest losses among
sheep and goats. Other infections thought to contribute to illness
among livestock during the flooding included nonspecific pneumonia,
pasteurellosis, contagious caprine pleuropneumonia, contagious
pustular dermatitis, bluetongue, foot rot, and complications of mange
(Field Mission of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
Nations, unpub. data)." - Mod.MPP]
