Bas-Congo: a new case of wild poliovirus found in Kimpese
---------------------------------------------------------
It is a wild type 1 poliovirus. The novelty is that the victim is an
adolescent nearly 10 years old. The low vaccination coverage and bad
hygienic conditions are among the causes of the infection, the person
responsible for the WHO/DRC measles surveillance (program) in the area said
to radiookapi.net
As far as Dr Moise Yagi of the World Health Organization is concerned, this
case appears to be imported from neighboring countries. "However," added Dr
Yagi, "we have to wait for the result of ongoing investigations to know if
there is a link between this new poliovirus (case) and those recently
discovered in Matadi, Mbanza-Ngungu, Seke Banza, Kasai Orientale Province,
and in Angola." According to the doctor, the low routine vaccination
coverage and the precarious hygienic conditions partly explain this new
case of poliovirus. He added that the vaccination program in the Kampese
health zone would be reinforced through a strategy of going door to door
(with health workers going from house to house to vaccinate children).

[According to the most recent case count on the polio eradication website
(as of 5 Dec 2006)
<http://www.polioeradication.org/casecount.asp>, there have been 8 cases of
wild poliovirus (WPV) associated polio in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC), with the date of most recent onset 13 Aug 2006. With respect
to Angola (which is named as the possible source of the importation into
the DRC), there had only been one case of WPV related disease reported,
with date of onset of the case on 27 Jun 2006. From the wording of the
above newswire, it suggests that there have been additional new cases found
in several other regions of the DRC. More information on these cases would
be appreciated.
