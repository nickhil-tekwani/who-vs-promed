First Report of Turnip mosaic virus in _Pisum sativum_ in Spain.
E. Segundo, G. Martin-Bretones, L. Ruiz, L. Velasco, D. Janssen, and I. M.
Cuadrado, CIFA La Mojonera, El Ejido, Almeria, Spain. Plant Dis. 87:103,
2003; published on-line as D-2002-1107-03N, 2002. Accepted for publication
26 Oct 2002.
During 2001 and 2002, commercial crops of pea (_Pisum sativum_ var.
_vulgare_) in Almeria (southeast Spain) showed vein clearing and chlorotic
mottle of leaves, leaf deformation, flower abortion, necrotic mottle and
deformation of pods, and stunted plant growth.
Sap of collected plants, mechanically inoculated on healthy pea plants,
reproduced symptoms observed in the field; local necrotic lesions were
produced on mechanically infected _Chenopodium quinoa_, _C. amaranticolor_,
and _Gomphrena globosa_, systemic mosaic symptoms on _Brassica napus_ and
_Nicotiana benthamiana_, and local lesions and systemic mosaic symptoms on
_N. clevelandii_, all of which are characteristic of Turnip mosaic
potyvirus (TuMV) (1).
A reverse transcription-PCR assay using general primers for the extreme 3'
end of the potyvirus genome amplified products of 750 and 1700 bp in
nucleic acid extracts from naturally infected pea plants as well as from
mechanically infected test plants. The overlapping nucleotide sequences of
the products (GenBank Accession No. AJ489259) had a nucelotide sequence of
86.5 percent and a derived amino acid identity of 95.0 percent with several
published sequences of TuMV (1).
This report cites the first partial nucleotide sequence of TuMV infecting
pea crops, and although natural infections of this virus in pea have been
reported in Morocco (1976) and in USA (2), to our knowledge, is the first
report of TuMV in Spain.

[TuMV probably occurs worldwide. It is transmitted by over 40 aphid
species, especially by _Myzus persicae_ and _Brevicoryne brassicae_;
_Aphididae_. It is transmitted in the non-persistent manner; also
transmitted manually but not by seed. It is known to be spreading in
Australia, China, and the UK. TuMV infects most cruciferous plants, but is
most damaging in Chinese cabbage, turnip, mustard, and radish. The presence
of virus-infected source plants such as infected crops or weeds, and
conditions that favor migrating aphid populations will lead to a high
incidence of TuMV infection. Disease management involves avoidance of
planting overlapping crops of species susceptible to TuMV. Resistant
cultivars of Chinese cabbage are available, but none are resistant to all
five strains known to occur in this crop. Insecticidal sprays in crop
fields are generally not effective in reducing virus spread.
