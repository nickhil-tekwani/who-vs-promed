2001/062 - Studies on Tomato yellow leaf curl viruses in some
Mediterranean countries
Accumulation of molecular data has led scientists to divide Tomato
yellow leaf curl begomovirus [TYLCV (EPPO A2 quarantine list) into
several species. Fauquet et al. (2000) proposed 8 different species
TYLCV-Sar, first reported in Sardinia, and TYLCV-Is, first reported
in Israel. Studies were carried out to identify the species of Tomato
yellow leaf curl viruses present in Europe (Accotto et al., 2000).
Tomato leaves from plants showing symptoms were collected from Italy,
Spain and Portugal from 1991 to 1998. [Of 3 identification methods
[RFLP of a DNA fragment from the coat protein gene, PAGE of a fragment
from the C2 gene, dot-blot hybridization used for typing purposes,
RFLP was the most suitable.
All European samples tested belonged to one of the 2 species.
TYLCV-Sar was identified in samples from: Italy (Sardinia, Sicily) and
Spain. TYLCV-Is was identified [in samples from Portugal and Spain
(in some Spanish samples both viruses were present).

[Under this system of geminivirus nomenclature proposed by the
Geminiviridae Study-Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy
of Viruses (ICTV), the first published name of a virus species is to
be retained without any additions, hence Tomato yellow leaf curl virus
(TYLCV) will be the name of the virus isolated in Israel.
The acronyms of the 8 proposed species of TYLCV are as follows:
TYLCV-China (TYLCV-CH)
TYLCV-Israel (TYLCV-IL)
TYLCV-Nigeria (TYLCV-NG)
TYLCV-Sardinia (TYLCV-Sar)
TYLCV-Saudi Arabia (TYLCV-SA)
TYLCV-Tanzania (TYLCV-TZ)
TYLCV-Thailand (TYLCV-TH)
TYLCV-Yemen (TYLCV-YE).
Virus evolution is ongoing, so other begomovirus species can be
expected to be defined.
The proposals from the Study-Group concern the 4 genera in the family
Geminiviridae:
- Mastrevirus (15 species, type species, Maize streak virus);
- Curtovirus (4 species, type species, Beet curly top virus);
- Topcuvirus (1 species, type species, Tomato pseudo-curly top
virus);
&
- Begomovirus (88 species, type species, Bean golden yellow mosaic
virus).
The proposals reflect a system of nomenclature for geminiviruses in
accordance with a virus "species - strain [isolate" system that will
be presented to the ICTV
for its consideration and approval. There are other viruses that are
considered as tentative or possible species in the Geminiviridae, but
these are not included in this summary. The web site contains the
complete text of the proposals. - Mod.DH
