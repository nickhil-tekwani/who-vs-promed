The Moewardi hospital in Surakarta, Central Java is treating 5
patients with symptoms of anthrax. Hospital spokesperson Mulyati said
on Friday [25 Feb 2011] that the 5 had been undergoing treatment since
23 Feb 2011. Preliminary examinations show that the patients may be
suffering from anthrax. "The indications are the wounds the patients
have under their eyes, on their arms and feet," she said, as quoted by
Tempointeraktif.com.

The hospital has sent samples from the patients to a biomedical
laboratory at the Sebelas Maret University's Faculty of Medicine in
Surakarta. It is expecting to receive the results in 3 days.

The 5 patients come from the Karangmojo village in Boyolali.

Mulyati said the patients' conditions are improving after treatment
by injections, ointment and oral medication. The patients suffer from
cutaneous anthrax infections, or skin anthrax, which is not as
dangerous, she added. "That's why we don't isolate them. They won't
spread the disease to other people, unless they touch the wounds," she
said.

[Not much difference from the initial report, but the awaited
confirmation is now only 3 days away, a marginal improvement. However,
it seems that the hospitalised patients are responding favorably to
their treatment. - Mod.MHJ]
