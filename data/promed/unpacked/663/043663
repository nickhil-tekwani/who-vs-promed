[It appears as if we may see continuing, if not increasing, numbers of
reports of "reverse transmission" of this zoonotic disease from humans
to animal species. As these reports accumulate, we should take the
opportunity to determine why they occur and what are the risk factors
for the "reverse transmission" on both farms and households where
other animal species are being infected. - Mod.PC]
