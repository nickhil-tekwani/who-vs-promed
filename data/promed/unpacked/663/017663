Because Chinese crayfish are sold in Louisiana, the Louisiana Commissioner
of Agriculture, Bob Odom, had some 23 samples of imported Chinese crayfish
tails from 15 different retail outlets checked for _Vibrio cholerae_. For
comparison, 11 samples of Louisiana crayfish tails were also checked at the
same time. All turned out to be vibrio negative. The apathogenic non-O1
_V.cholerae_, reported in one of the 300 Chinese crayfish samples in
Sweden, is not uncommon.
A colleague of mine, expert in mariculture, tells me that he has bought
these Chinese crayfish and in his opinion they show obvious signs of having
been "pasteurised" by the raw tails being briefly dunked into boiling water
until the water comes back to the boil. In his experience the contamination
would occur when the hot tails are re-chilled by being immersed in cold
water which is non-sterile.
