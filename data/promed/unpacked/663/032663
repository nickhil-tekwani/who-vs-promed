Parcel containing anthrax sent to PM house (AFP)
------------------------------------------------
* Parcel sent from Jamshoro district, Pakistan's biggest city used by the United States to ship supplies to troops in Afghanistan

* Police still investigating how and why a parcel containing anthrax was sent to the prime minister's official residence in Islamabad

It appeared to be the 1st reported case of anthrax sent to a government office in Pakistan, a nuclear-armed country of 174 million that is battling a Taliban insurgency and where Al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden was shot dead. "The parcel containing anthrax powder was sent last month, about 20 days ago. After the laboratory test confirmed that the parcel contained anthrax we registered a case against unknown people," said police officer Hakim Khan.

There was no immediate confirmation from the prime minister's house, which lies in the heavily secured secretariat area of the capital Islamabad.

Neither was it immediately clear who was responsible, or how they could have accessed anthrax, of any quality, in Pakistan.

Police said the parcel was posted from the Jamshoro district in southern province Sindh, the capital of which is Karachi -- Pakistan's biggest city used by the United States to ship supplies to troops fighting in Afghanistan. "We have sent a police team to investigate it and to find the culprits there," said Khan, an officer at the secretariat police station.

But in Jamshoro, 180 kilometres (113 miles) northeast of Karachi, police said they had not been informed by Islamabad of any anthrax delivery, instead finding out through local media reports. "We have not yet received any instructions from the government to investigate this matter," local police official Bashir Ahmed told AFP. "We have asked the local post office protectively to check their records to know about the sender. We can't say how long it will take to complete the investigation. We expect a quick result if the sender's identity is not fake."

In November 2001, police arrested two men suspected of sending a letter containing anthrax to Pakistan's largest newspaper, Jang.

[Although fake anthrax-letters are unfortunately not uncommon, this is the first time since 2001 that such a letter has been confirmed to contain anthrax [spores, presumably, though the specifics are not provided. - Mod.MHJ] The strains known to occur in Pakistan are unfortunately few, though genomically known for those that have been archived. But if this letter contained true anthrax spores, genotyping them will be very revealing. At this time we have to assume that circumstances are what have been described and to take the necessary precautions, as there are certain to be imitators and wannabees.

One might ask, why use a parcel when a letter has been shown to be perfectly adequate when intending mayhem? We must await clarification as to what was in fact involved. Also whether there were any letters relevant to an 'attack' included. A parcel would be more likely to contain cultures for a laboratory, for example if mistakenly addressed to the Prime Minister's Office.

Pakistani comments on this report suggest that it might be an effort to distract folk from events within the country. Either way, it is a dangerous distraction and we may assume that there will be echoes. - MHJ
