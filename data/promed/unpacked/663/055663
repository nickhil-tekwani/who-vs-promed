The Health Ministry confirmed in a statement released Tue, 17 Nov 2015 the death from rabies of a 9-year-old child from the village of Borj Rass (province of Mahdia).

The Ministry said in its statement that the father of the victim went on [15 Nov 2015], in his son's company, to the emergency services of Mahdia hospital, where the medical staff suspected the presence of disease symptoms in the child. Even though the father denied his son had been bitten by a rabid animal, the doctors took a blood sample for analysis [sic], but the child died before the results of the analysis, said the statement.

A field investigation conducted by the medical team of the region revealed that the child was bitten in August 2015 by an apparently rabid dog but the bite was not deemed severe enough to induce the father to present him to a medical center to receive the necessary care, according to the same source.

The regional health services informed that, following this incident, the Ministry of Health has carried out a vaccination campaign that targeted so far 29 people belonging to the family, relatives and medical and paramedical staff who have been in contact with the victim.

The Ministry has also stressed that preventive actions were conducted in coordination with the regional authorities to reduce the risk of spreading the virus.

It has, moreover, initiated a mass vaccination campaign of pet dogs, in addition to a campaign of slaughter of stray dogs in the affected locality.

According to the same source, it is recommended, if one is bitten by an animal suspected with rabies, to thoroughly wash the wound with water and soap and to rush immediately to the nearest health center to receive the necessary free rabies treatment.

The Ministry mentions in the same document that preventive medical assistance as well as rabies treatment are provided free of charge in 360 health facilities located throughout the Republic in addition to the Pasteur Institute in Tunis.

[The source article alluded to the fact that the source of human infection was a stray dog. At the medical center, they say they suspected rabies and took a blood sample from the patient upon his arrival. Since no blood/serum test for active rabies process is known to us as currently recognised or applicable, the aim of the requested test and its identity deserve to be explained. It will also be helpful to note how long after his admission to the hospital the boy died and which tissues were used for the definite diagnosis.

The series of human rabies cases due to bites by rabid stray dogs continues in Tunisia. On 29 Oct 2015, 12 people had been bitten by a rabid dog in Monastir, located 52 km [32.31 miles] from Mahdia.

Previously, in 2015, human rabies successively struck the eastern suburbs of Tunis, Sfax, Bizerte and Kairouan. This suggests that these regions of the country are experiencing a particularly high concentration of stray dogs.
