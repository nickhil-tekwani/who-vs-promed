HealthMap is announcing the release of new iPhone, iPad and Android apps. Visit the iTunes Store and Google Play to download "HealthMap: Outbreaks Near Me."

With Outbreaks Near Me, users have access to the latest information on infectious disease worldwide. Check the most recent health news in your neighborhood or travel destination, or submit reports of new outbreaks that have not yet been identified.

The new app maintains familiarity but features a sleeker look, increased usability, and more features. Switch between map view, list view, and news from our publication, The Disease Daily. Submit a new report, or view your past submissions by entering your email address.

Download the new app from Apple iTunes Store or Google Play and let us know what you think!
