As if coronavirus attack on human beings was not enough, a virus has attacked animals, especially cattle, in Madhya Pradesh. The virus, named lumpy skin virus, has taken hundreds of villages under its influence in Mahakaushal and Vindhya region. Spread of lumpy skin disease (LSD) has been reported from several districts in Mahakaushal region. Thousands of cattle have been infected from this deadly [see comment] virus, but no death has been reported so far.

Veterinary university in Jabalpur has constituted special teams of veterinarians to contain the disease following instructions from the state government. "Alert has been sounded in all districts. Teams of vet experts are active on the ground to contain the disease. Advisory has also been issued for cattle owners on how to contain the virus and also on treatment for afflicted cattle," said ACS [additional chief secretary] of the animal husbandry department, JN Kansotia.

The cattle disease LSD has spread in some parts of India. After some cases were reported from Odisha, it is said to have spread to Chhattisgarh, from where it has entered Madhya Pradesh.

Cattle in several districts, including Mandla, Dindori, Anuppur, Shahdol, and Jabalpur, have been afflicted by this disease so far. It is also now spreading towards Vindhya region. In Anuppur district alone, more than 2000 cattle from about 190 villages have been found suffering from the LSD.

Vice-chancellor of the Jabalpur Veterinary University, SP Tiwari, says that this virus [was] identified about a year ago, and not much research has been done on it; therefore, teams of veterinary experts are on it. "This virus is confined to cattle only and does not spread in humans. Lumps are formed on skin of cattle, and joints swell. The lumps formed on the skin convert into wounds later. Flies are the main carrier," said Tiwari.

[The application of the term "deadly virus" (or "deadly disease") requires caution. The case fatality rate of LSD in adult animals is, in many cases, lower than 10%, although exceptions may occur, and mortality in young animals may be higher. This does not mean that economical losses in cattle herds are caused mainly/only by deaths. A widely spread debilitating disease in cattle, without deaths, may be worse, in economic terms, than an acute, killing disease of lower incidence. - Mod.AS]

Suspected cases of lumpy skin disease (LSD) have been reported from parts of Assam, as highlighted in a series of tweets by senior journalist Mrinal Talukdar. "The new epidemic (LSD) has hit cattle of Assam. It is very important to create awareness with farmers and awake our government," Talukdar said in a tweet. "Experts have requested to buy goat pox vaccines from other states. This is the only way to stop this epidemic," he added. [See comment.]

Urging the state agriculture and veterinary minister Atul Bora to act quickly, Talukdar wrote, "Please act quickly. If this LSD [is] going to spread amongst the cattle like the swine flu of pigs, then it is going to [be a] catastrophe for the farmers of Assam. Moreover, cattle have a special place in every home. Get the vaccines very soon and go war footing," he added.

It may be mentioned here that the state government has already issued an advisory [notice] regarding LSD, which the government has urged to be circulated widely among the farmers and the veterinarians. "This is to inform that there are reports of cattle and buffaloes suffering from a disease condition showing symptoms of the eruption of round cutaneous nodules on the skin all over the body. These may be suspect cases of lumpy skin disease (LSD), an OIE-notifiable disease of bovines, and 1st notification of the disease in the country has already been submitted from some districts of Odisha," it advised.

"In this regard, please find enclosed an advisory for LSD for information and wide circulation amongst field veterinarians, veterinary institutions in your district for awareness-raising, and necessary advice to the farmers," it added. "Further, you are requested to direct all concerned to investigate all suspected cases of LSD/pseudo LSD on priority and forward clinical/necropsy samples along with the epidemiological format," it further said.

[The statement "goat pox vaccines (are) the only way to stop" LSD deserves a visit. Capripoxviruses are cross-reactive within the genus. Consequently, it is possible to protect cattle against LSD using strains of _Capripoxvirus_ derived from sheep or goats. However, it is recommended to carry out controlled trials, using the most susceptible breeds, prior to introducing a vaccine strain not usually used in cattle.

Useful, exhaustive information on LSD vaccine requirements is available in chapter C of the LSD chapter in OIE's Terrestrial Manual, at https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.04.12_LSD.pdf.

India submitted its immediate notification announcing its 1st LSD outbreaks on 18 Nov 2019. The "start of the event" date was given as 12 Aug 2019; see at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=32387. The report addressed 3 outbreaks, all in India's north eastern state Odisha [referred to as Orissa, the former name for the state, in the OIE report]. The outbreak, assumed to be introduced from Bangladesh, has spread since in a southwesterly direction, most probably by movements of infected cattle. Transmission of LSD virus (LSDV) is thought to be predominantly by arthropods, natural contact transmission in the absence of vectors being inefficient.

Since November 2019, the disease has been identified also in the states of Kerala and Telangana, now followed by Madhya Pradesh and Assam. There have been no follow-up reports, and the spread is not covered in OIE's LSD maps. OIE's global LSD map, presenting all outbreaks reported since January 2018, is available at https://tinyurl.com/ya6sk6vr (click on Bangladesh or northeastern India, zoom in to the required resolution). - Mod.AS
