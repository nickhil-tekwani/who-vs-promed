Horse disease rocks KwaZulu-Natal
---------------------------------
More than 140 cases of African Horse Sickness (AHS), with 100 deaths,
have been recorded in KwaZulu-Natal since an outbreak in December
2008, the Mercury newspaper reported on Wednesday [1 Apr 2009].
Experts said this was the highest incidence of the disease in the
country. The disease is transmitted by a type of midge and happens
mostly in the warm, rainy summer season.

African Horse Sickness Trust CEO Douglas Welsh said an outbreak of
the disease "generally happens every year".

Northern KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo and Mpumalanga were the worst
affected. Horse owners near areas where the outbreaks had occurred
were urged to have their horses vaccinated and to treat them with
insect repellent daily.

Racing SA CEO Peter Gibson said the summer months were a high-risk
period. "We should start seeing a decline towards the end of April."

On Monday [30 Mar 2009], the Western Cape department of agriculture
said horse movements into that province would be restricted due to
concerns about AHS. "These restrictions have been instituted due to
the increasing number of reported and suspicious cases of AHS in the
rest of South Africa," said spokesperson Alie van Jaarsveld.

There had been no reported cases of AHS in the Western Cape or Northern Cape.
