[This has become a major epizootic. The 7 reports, as well as an
interactive map presenting all outbreaks reported since the start of
the epizootic in Morocco, can be accessed on-line in the above URL.
The map (zoom in!) shows the extensive spread of PPR in Morocco, now
present in all 1st-class administrative divisions of the Kingdom. A
cluster of outbreaks adjacent to Morocco's north-eastern border
illustrates the apparent risk of PPR spreading to Algeria.

The only practical way to stop the further dissemination of PPR
within Morocco and to diminish the risk of its spread elsewhere is
vaccination. However, the article "Measures applied" in the last
follow-up report (No 6) still includes -- among the 5 points -- "no
vaccination", while the passage "Measures to be applied" includes a
single point: "Screening". - Mod.AS]
