In mid-August [2021], ducks suspected of dying from avian botulism were collected from the pond at Loring Park and at Lake Nokomis, both in Minneapolis.

"It's almost certainly botulism but without lab testing, we do not know, said Tami Vogel, communications director at the Wildlife Rehabilitation Center of Minnesota in Roseville.

"We see botulism cases flare in years of hot, drought conditions when shallow ponds/lakes become too low and an anaerobic condition occurs," she told us.

Researchers were to examine the birds to confirm cause of death.

[Avian botulism is a paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin produced by the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_. This pathogen is widespread in soil and requires warm temperatures, a protein source, and an anaerobic (no oxygen) environment in order to become active and produce toxin. Decomposing vegetation and invertebrates combined with warm temperatures can provide ideal conditions for the botulism bacteria to activate and produce toxin. There are several types of toxin produced by strains of _C. botulinum_; birds are most commonly affected by type C and to a lesser extent type E.

Birds either ingest the toxin directly or may eat invertebrates (e.g. chironomids, fly larvae) containing the toxin. Invertebrates are not affected by the toxin and store it in their body. A cycle develops in a botulism outbreak when fly larvae (maggots) feed on animal carcasses and ingest toxin. Ducks and other birds that consume toxin-laden maggots can develop botulism after eating as few as 3 or 4 maggots.

Healthy birds, affected birds, and dead birds in various stages of decay are commonly found in the same area. The toxin affects the nervous system by preventing impulse transmission to muscles. Birds are unable to use their wings and legs normally or control the 3rd eyelid, neck muscles, and other muscles. Birds with paralyzed neck muscles cannot hold their heads up and often drown. Death can also result from water deprivation, electrolyte imbalance, respiratory failure, or predation.

Prompt removal and proper disposal of carcasses by burial or burning (in accordance with applicable ordinances) are highly effective in removing toxin and maggot sources from the environment.

Providing mildly affected birds with fresh water, shade, and protection from predators may help them recover from the intoxication. Botulism antitoxin is available but requires special handling and must be given early in the intoxication. Also, providing it to wild bird populations is extremely challenging and often unfeasible. Birds that survive a botulism outbreak are NOT immune to botulism toxin.
