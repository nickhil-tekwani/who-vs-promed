[1] India: fears Ebola positive man spread virus

Doctors sweat over whether Ebola positive man spread virus
----------------------------------------------------------
Days after the semen sample of a man tested positive for Ebola on his arrival in the capital [New Delhi] from Liberia, there are concerns that the virus may have skipped the safety check. Health authorities are worried that if other secretion samples of the Indian such as sweat, urine, etc., test positive for Ebola, chances are that the deadly virus may have spread to those travelling on the same flight, including flight attendants who may have come in direct contact with him.

After the semen samples of the 26-year-old who travelled last week tested positive, his other secretions and body fluids have been sent for testing at National Centre for Disease Control, official sources said. The man has been kept in isolation at the Airport Health Organisation's quarantine centre. The blood samples of the man have tested negative.

Personnel from the health and civil aviation ministries are now also monitoring other passengers who travelled in the same flight from Liberia, said an official.... -- more

[2] Ebola case definitions updated
Date: Wed 19 Nov 2014
From: Jagila Wesley <jagila@gmail.com> [edited]


I am a faithful subscriber to ProMED and a big fan of your updates. I just wanted to write to point out that the WHO case definition listed [in ProMED Ebola virus disease - ex Africa (39): India, worldwide susp. or quarantined 20141118.2966874] are specific to WHO-AFRO region (http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/ebola/ebola-case-definition-contact-en.pdf).

If read as they stand, it can be assumed that any person with influenza-like symptoms in the USA is a suspected Ebola case even without positive contact history or travel history. This would trigger mass pandemonium in a country like the USA where the probability of having Ebola is very, very low, versus in parts of the world like the affected countries in West Africa where case probability is high. I think it is important to frame the information as accurately as possible while presenting it. Thank you, and I look forward to more updates.

[ProMED thanks Jagila for pointing this out. I searched for "ebola case definition" on the WHO Geneva website (http://www.who.int) and what they show is that AFRO region definition. Perhaps because of what she has pointed out, both WHO and CDC have stopped using "suspected". WHO has been using "Case Under Investigation" since September 2014 (http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/134581/1/WHO_EVD_Guidance_SurvNonECount_14.1_eng.pdf?ua=1), and since 16 Nov 2014, CDC only has 2 categories: "Person Under Investigation (PUI)" and Confirmed (http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/hcp/case-definition.html)
-- but the media still use the word "suspected". - Mod.JW]

Extensive explanatory footnotes are below the table. As a UK/US dual national, I was interested to note that although the UK has pledged much more of its gross national income (GNI) than the USA, the USA has to date distributed twice the amount in cash that the UK has. - Mod.JW]
