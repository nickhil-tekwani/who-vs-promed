Dr. Ira Shafran, an internal medicine specialist at Florida Hospital,
Orlando, was cited as telling the annual meeting of the American Society
for Microbiology that he was treating 29 Crohn's patients with a
combination of clarithromycin and rifabutin -- drugs commonly used in
fighting tuberculosis infections, adding that, "So far we have seen major
responses in 20 of the 29 patients, 70 percent."
The story says that the new study follows reports Monday that scientists
had shown the elusive bacteria, _Mycobacterium avium_ ss paratuberculosis
exists in Crohn's patients.
In a companion study described Tuesday, colleagues at the University of
Central Florida, Orlando, found that in the test tube the combination of
anti-TB drugs worked best to control and kill off colonies of _M.
paratuberculosis_.
The story concludes by saying that as many as 1 million Americans have the
disease. In certain parts of the world, especially in Scotland, the disease
has reached epidemic proportions. Researchers suggest there is a connection
between Crohn's and dairy products and dairy farming.
