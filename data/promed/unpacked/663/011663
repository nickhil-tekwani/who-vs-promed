More than 130 goats have died of a disease in Khotang's Khidima
Village Development Committee. The ailment with symptoms of scabies
and coughing has spread in goats in Wards No 4, 5, and 6 of Khidima
over the past 2 weeks.

[An infectious caprine disease characterised by pulmonary involvement
("coughing"?), skin lesions ("scabies"?), and mortality (the rate is
not given in the newswire above) may be attributed primarily to
sheep/goat pox, a disease known to be endemic in Nepal. Other
diseases, which should be taken into consideration in the differential
diagnosis are: PPR (peste des petits ruminants) and pasteurellosis
(both endemic in Nepal, but no skin involvement) as well as CCPP
(contagious caprine pleuropneumonia; similarly without skin lesions;
its status in Nepal ius not available, except "not reported in 2008").
See also commentary in ProMED-mail archive no. 20090124.0317.

Results of the epidemiological/laboratory investigations from Nepal
will be appreciated.
