The Statesman Journal reported that Oregon's syphilis and gonorrhea rates have increased dramatically in recent years. Syphilis prevalence recently tied high numbers from more than 2 decades ago and is now twice the national average. Gonorrhea rates saw a sharp 18-percent increase between 2012 and 2013. Dr. Sean Schafer, a medical epidemiologist with the Oregon Health Authority, thinks the numbers are distressing. "We haven't seen numbers like this since the late 1980s, early 1990s. And this year [2014] is looking like another bad year," he said.

When syphilis is in its early stage of infection, it is the most contagious. The 1st symptoms of syphilis, a sore then a rash, often go undetected and a person can transmit the disease easily to another person. There was nearly a 25-percent increase of early syphilis cases between 2012 and 2013, from 312 to 404. This year [2014] has already seen 2 cases of congenital syphilis in infants, causing one death.

Schafer reports that 96 percent of 2013 syphilis cases were in men, with 77 percent of them among men who have sex with men. More than 50 percent were coinfected with HIV. 77 percent of 2013 gonorrhea cases were also among men. Gonorrhea often has no symptoms and is unknowingly transmitted to other partners. HIV-infected gay men often choose HIV-positive partners to avoid using condoms, but they still can transmit STDs. Schafer recommends that all gay men and women younger than 24 should get a syphilis and gonorrhea test every year. Both STDs are easily treated with antibiotics if detected early.

[ProMED-mail recently posted a report on the rising incidence of syphilis and gonococcal disease in the US state of Oregon (Syphilis - USA (08): (AK, OR) rising incidence, MSM, social networking apps 20140602.2513266). The news report above gives more detailed information about the outbreak, specifically that it is occurring mainly among men who have sex with men (MSM) and is associated with a high incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection.

The increase in syphilis and gonococcal disease in Oregon among MSM is similar to the situation in other jurisdictions in the US and other countries, as reported in past ProMED-mail posts listed below, which have been characterized by high rates of HIV coinfection, high-risk sexual behavior, use of drugs such as methamphetamines, use of Internet chat rooms to meet sex partners (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5510a1.htm), and more recently, use of smartphone applications like Grindr, a gay social networking site.

Oregon, with a population of almost 4 million in 2012, is a state in the Pacific Northwest of the US. It is bordered on its west by the Pacific Ocean, north by Washington, south by California, east by Idaho, and southeast by Nevada (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon). - Mod.ML
