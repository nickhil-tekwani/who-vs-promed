Viet Nam: avian influenza situation - WHO update 2:
---------------------------------------------------
4th case of avian influenza confirmed
-------------------------------------
As of Thu 13 Jan 2005, The Ministry of Health in Viet Nam has confirmed the
4th case of avian influenza A (H5N1) infection in Viet Nam since December
2004. The patient is an 18 year old woman from the southern province of
Tien Giang. She developed symptoms on 1 Jan 2005 and was admitted to
hospital on 5 Jan 2005. She remains in a critical condition. The 3 other
H5N1 patients reported so far this year, who all resided in different
provinces in southern Viet Nam, have died.
This latest case brings the total in Viet Nam reported since January 2004
to 31 cases, 23 of which have been fatal. The Vietnamese government today
[Thu 13 Jan 2005] held a national meeting on avian influenza control to
which prominent health and local government officials from all provinces of
Viet Nam were invited, along with the representatives of WHO and FAO in
Viet Nam. Participants were updated on the current avian influenza
situation in animals and humans and provided with information and guidance
on the intensified measures needed to control avian influenza in the run-up
to the festivities of the Lunar New Year.
Tsunami in South East Asia and the risk from avian influenza
------------------------------------------------------------
Concerns have been raised about whether the recent tsunami in South East
Asia may have increased the risk of an influenza pandemic. The level of
pandemic risk depends on how widespread the H5N1 virus is in domestic
poultry, how often the virus is transmitted to humans, and the concurrent
circulation of human influenza viruses. Areas with the highest prevalence
of avian influenza were not directly affected by the tsunami, thus there is
no inherent increased risk of the emergence of the pandemic strain due to
the tsunami itself. But any activity that spreads avian influenza increases
the possibility of the emergence of a pandemic virus. The risk of importing
avian influenza into areas affected by the tsunami can be minimized by
controlling the movement of poultry from areas where outbreaks of avian
influenza have occurred. It is also important to ensure that infected
poultry are kept out of the food chain, including emergency food relief
activities.

[In the ProMED-mail post "Avian influenza, human - East Asia (05): Viet Nam
20050111.0092", a report from the New York Times stated that an 18 year old
woman was the 4th suspected case of avian influenza virus infection in Viet
Nam since December 2004. A following Reuters report indicated that an 18
year old woman from Hau Giang province in the Mekong Delta, who was a
suspected avian influenza case, had died on Mon 10 Jan 2005. The 18 year
old woman referred to in the WHO report above is from the southern province
of Tien Giang and is still alive. Therefore the 18 year old from Hau Giang
province, who died, may be the 5th case of avian influenza, if the
diagnosis is confirmed.
According to WHO, the cumulative number of confirmed human cases of avian
influenza A (H5N1) virus infection in East Asia since 28 Jan 2004 is now 48
(17 in Thailand and 31 in Viet Nam), of whom 35 have died (12 in Thailand
and 23 in Viet Nam). - Mod.CP]
