--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
According to the report by Novosibirsk oblast Rospotrebnadzor [Public
health Agency], 241 people sought medical treatment following tick
bites during the past week. 23 of them have been hospitalized due to
suspected tick-borne encephalitis virus infection. Up to the present
there have been 16 302 visits to health care facilities following
tick bites, 551 people have been hospitalized, and 128 cases have
been confirmed including 22 children. There has been one fatal case.
The statistics for this year are concerning; 50 more people have been
hospitalized this year than in the preceding year. The ticks have
been most active in the Sovetskoe and Pervomayskoe regions of
Novosibirsk Oblast. Across the oblast the greatest number of tick
bites has been registered in the Novosibirsk, Toguchinsk, Moshkovskoe
and Iskatimskoe regions.

24 more cases of tick-borne encephalitis in Arkhangelsk during the past week
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Regnum News Agency has been informed by the oblast press centre
that 134 cases of tick bites have been registered in the Oblast
during the past week and 24 people have contracted tick-borne
encephalitis and borelliosis. [Contrary to the heading of the report,
the statistics appear to refer to tick-borne disease and do not
discriminate between tick-borne encephalitis (a vaccine preventable
virus disease) and borelliosis (a tick transmitted bacterial diseas.
- Mod.CP]. Since the onset of tick activity 6146 people sought
medical care because of tick bites and 136 people fell il.
Fortunately, there have been no fatal cases. The risk for tick bite
is particularly high at this time of year, the experts say. A
decrease in tick activity is not expected before the end of August or
beginning of September. A warning has been issued for those who plan
trips to the countryside to avoid exposing unprotected skin. The most
reliable protection is the tick-borne encephalitis vaccine, which has
been administered to 3000 people across the oblast.
