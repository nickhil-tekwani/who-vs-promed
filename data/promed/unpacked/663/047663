Five children have died in the Chernigov region of Ukraine as a
result of an unknown infection. Doctors report that they have seen
nothing similar previously. According to the press service of the
Ukrainian Ministry of Health, all the deaths occurred at a
residential school in the beautiful ancient city of Nizhyn. Another 4
children have contracted the virus [the presumptive cause] and are in
critical condition. The residential school where the 5 deaths
occurred accommodates children with central nervous system
disabilities. The deceased inmates ranged from 10 to 19 years of age.

On the following day, Thu 12 Aug 2010, in the City Maternity
Hospital, 4 children were being treated in the intensive care unit.
According to the hospital physicians, the condition of the patients
was considered to be serious [It cannot be assumed that these
children, and those in the residential school, are affected by the
same infectious agent. - Mod.CP].

According to the preliminary assessment, the children have contracted
a viral infection with exanthema (rash) distinct from herpes.

[There is not sufficient information in this and other similar
reports from the Ukraine to suggest a diagnosis. A viral infection is
assumed, but unconfirmed, other than influenza A/B virus infection,
which has been excluded according to one report. Further information
from any source would be welcomed. ProMED-mail thanks correspondent
Andrew S. for drawing attention to this situation.
