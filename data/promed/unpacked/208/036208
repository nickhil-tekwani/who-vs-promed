Horses dead in Western Cape
-----------------------------
The State Veterinary Authorities have imposed a ban on the movement
of all horses in the Western Cape until further notice after 13
horses died in the African Horse Sickness [AHS] surveillance zone.
The authorities have requested further testing of specimens. The
Western Cape has had 2 horse racing meetings cancelled within the
past week. Three quarters of the dead horses were thoroughbreds.
State veterinarian Dr. Pieter Koen said: "The rumours of 18 deaths
are wrong. There are 13 confirmed deaths and it's not certain what
the cause is. Further testing is being done and we expect the results
from Onderstepoort's Virology Department on Wednesday evening."
He added that the symptoms did not correspond with those of African
Horse Sickness and there was a possibility that the cause was some
form of equine encephalosis. Once the results are confirmed,
decisions about lifting the travel ban and the consequent resumption
of horse racing will be taken.

[Horses can be protected against African Horse Sickness (AHS) by the
readily available (live-attenuated) vaccines, produced in
Onderstepoort; the increased incidence of AHS in the Western Cape is
of particular concern to the exporters of horses and to South African
participants in international races.
Infected horses remain viraemic for approximately 18 days; the
viraemic stage in zebras, which usually show only mild or even
subclinical symptoms, may last for up to 28 days (similar to
donkeys), and thus might become spreaders of the AHS virus. Such was
said to be the route of AHSV-4 introduction into central Spain in 1987.
Is movement of zebras (e.g., for slaughter purposes) liable to legal
restrictions in South Africa? Information on this subject will be appreciated.
Mentioning the possibility that the cause of some observed cases was
in fact "some form of equine encephalosis" deserves some clarification.
Equine encephalosis (EE) is a subclinical to mild, occasionally
peracute, arthropod-borne diseases of horses. The orbivirus was 1st
recognised in South Africa following its sudden appearance during the
early months of 1967. Subsequent serological studies have shown it to
be both widespread and prevalent in southern Africa. Like other
orbiviruses (eg Bluetongue, AHS, Epizootic haemorrhagic disease) it
is transmitted by culicoides. So far, EE has not been recorded in
other parts of the world; the hazard of its possible spread to Europe
has recently been raised by EFSA experts (see in 20070414.1249).
