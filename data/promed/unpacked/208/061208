I noticed you have posted the meningitis outbreak in Sudan from the
Reuters report. Reuters has now corrected the number of cases from
the 2011 reported in the original report to 211.
[The newer Reuters article is found below, noting the large disparity
in numbers. - Mod.LL]
Efforts are under way to contain an outbreak of meningitis that has
so far killed 17 people in the southern Sudanese state of Warap, the
WHO said on Mon 22 Jan 2007.
"We have been working in collaboration with the government of
southern Sudan's ministry of health in Warap for the past 3 weeks.
There have been 17 deaths and 211 reported cases of meningitis,"
Abdullahi Ahmed, the head of WHO in South Sudan, said.
However, showing a large disparity in figures, a press release was
issued on Sat 20 Jan 2007 by the Governor of Warap State, Anthony Bol
Madut, who stated that more than 1000 people had died... "There is an
outbreak of meningitis and [an] unknown disease spreading fast
throughout the state, and there is a fear it may affect other
neighboring states. Up to this time, the death toll is over 1000 this
week alone," the governor said in a statement.
Ahmed said it was common for meningitis to strike southern Sudan at
this "dry and windy" time of year, as it lies within the African
meningitis belt that stretches across sub-Saharan Africa. The disease
mainly occurs during the dry season, from December to June.
The most serious outbreak occurred in 1996, when more than 250 000
cases and 25 000 deaths were registered across Africa.
