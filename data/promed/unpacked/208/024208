Outbreak of multidrug resistant _Salmonella typhimurium_ DT120 due to
ready-to-eat turkey meat in Denmark
--------------------------------------------------------
From Aug to Oct 2002, 41 human cases of multidrug resistant _Salmonella
enterica_ subsp. _enterica_ serotype Typhimurium resistant to ampicillin,
tetracycline, streptomycin, and sulfamethoxazole (R-type ASSuT) were
reported in Denmark. Cases were not confined to one region, but were spread
out over most of the country. At least 10 of the patients were admitted to
hospital. No deaths have been recorded.
Until August 2002, _S._ Typhimurium R-type ASSuT was uncommon in human
isolates. From 1997 to July 2002, a total of 81 (2.5 per cent) strains with
this resistance profile were found in 3114 cases of _S._ Typhimurium
infection tested for antimicrobial susceptibility.
[figure: epidemic curve (N=41) showing number of cases and week of onset,

Data from routine salmonella surveillance on domestic animals (primarily
poultry, pigs, and cattle) and foods revealed that 83 per cent of all _S._
Typhimurium definitive phage type (DT) 120 isolates with the current
outbreak resistance profile originated from turkey meat from a major Danish
producer of turkey and turkey meat products. Most of the rest of the _S._
Typhimurium DT 120 isolates found were from pigs. Pulsed field gel
electrophoresis (PFGE) profiles of the first 28 isolates from humans,
turkey meat, and pork were compared. 22 of 28 human isolates shared the
same PFGE profile. This profile was also seen in several isolates from both
turkey and pork.
Interview data from 10 of 28 of the outbreak-related patients were
available from an ongoing case control study on sporadic human cases of
resistant _S._ Typhimurium infections. Data on food exposure revealed an
increased odds ratio among patients who had eaten cold, smoked,
ready-to-eat turkey meat. To further support the hypothesis that this
turkey meat was the source of infection, investigations were carried out at
the processing plant. Samples of turkey meat used in the production of the
current product yielded _S._ Typhimurium DT 120. An isolate of
multiresistant _S._ Typhimurium DT 120 R-type ASSuT was obtained from a
sample of the cold, smoked, ready-to-eat meat, and this isolate had the
same PFGE profile as the outbreak strain.
Following this outbreak, additional restrictive guidelines were put in
place at the production facility. No human cases have been found since 8
Nov 2002. According to information from the turkey meat producer, the
contaminated product had been sold only on the Danish market. The
implicated plant, however, has trade connections with other European
countries, and the possibility of similar incidents occurring elsewhere
cannot be ruled out.
This investigation was carried out by the Danish Veterinary Institute, the
Statens Serum Institut, and the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration.

[Several phage types of _S._ Typhimurium have been characterized as
carrying resistance genes to multiple antimicrobials. Definitive phage type
(DT) 104 has been the most prominent and has been described in Europe
(1,2), North America (3,4), and Asia (5). The salmonella genomic island of
_S._ Typhimurium DT104 has been characterized, and this identical
43-kilobase region has been found in _S._ Typhimurium DT120 and _S.
enterica_ serovar Agona with similar antimicrobial resistant phenotypes (6).
