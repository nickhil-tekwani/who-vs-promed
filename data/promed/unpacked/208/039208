A child has died after an _E. coli_ outbreak in Scotland being linked to a brand of blue cheese. No further information on the identity or age of the child - or where they are from exactly - has yet been released.

A multi-agency incident management team (IMT) chaired by Health Protection Scotland was investigating an outbreak of the same strain of _E. coli_ 0157 in which 20 people were infected. At least 2 of those are known to be in England. The investigation found those affected had consumed Dunsyre Blue, made by Lanarkshire-based Errington Cheese, before they became unwell.

IMT chair Dr Alison Smith-Palmer said: "Our thoughts are with them at this time and we ask that their privacy be respected. All confirmed cases became unwell prior to the end of July 2016. As there have been no new cases since then, the IMT will now stand down and work to produce its final report." A total of 11 of those infected were treated in hospital. The outbreak initially affected 16 people, who developed symptoms between 2 and 15 Jul 2016.

The majority of cases had consumed the blue cheese while eating out but the company carried out a voluntary recall of suspected batches and advised consumers who had bought batches of the product between mid-May 2016 and the end of July 2016 not to eat it. Of the initial 16 cases, 14 were in Scotland across seven NHS boards and 2 were in England.

Health Protection Scotland said that despite extensive investigation no link to a majority of cases other than the cheese could be established. No new cases have been identified for several weeks and no-one has fallen ill since the voluntary recall on 29 Jul 2016. A final report into the incident could take up to 6 months to be finalized. Health Protection Scotland said: "Epidemiological investigations identified Dunsyre Blue cheese as the most likely cause of the outbreak." Despite extensive investigation, including looking for other possible food sources, no other link to a majority of cases could be established."

In a statement issued last month [July 2016] on its website, Errington Cheese said: "All our testing, covering a period of almost 6 months from 21 Mar 2016 to date, is completely clear of _E. coli_ O157. All authority testing is negative for _E.coli_ O157. All customer testing for E.coli O157 is negative. All farm testing for _E. coli_ O157 is negative. At least 6 samples have been taken from the implicated batch D14; they all tested negative for _E. coli_ O157." The statement added: "From what we can gather, all cases had an onset of symptoms between 1 and 15 July (2-week period). However, our cheese was available over an 8/9 week period. From this we conclude that the outbreak was more likely to have been caused by something with a shorter shelf life or not by a food at all."

[Unfortunately, Health Protection Scotland does not have a "smoking gun" (or in this case "smoking cheese"), that is, an isolation of the outbreak strain from the cheese. This does not always occur but HPS seems to have epidemiologically linked the cheese to the outbreak.

Fatalities from enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC) are associated with the development of hemolytic syndrome (HUS) and particularly in those who develop HUS together with central nervous system complications which include seizures and strokes. - Mod.LL
