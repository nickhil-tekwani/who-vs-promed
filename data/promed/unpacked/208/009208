Multi-country cluster of Listeria monocytogenes ST1247 in five EU countries news epidemiological update.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ECDC has identified a microbiological link between an outbreak of 9 _Listeria monocytogenes_ ST1247 cases in Denmark and 9 additional cases reported between 2014 and 2018 in Estonia (2 cases) Finland (2), France (1) and Sweden (4).

In Denmark, the outbreak investigation is led by Statens Serum Institut (SSI), the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration and the DTU Food Institute.

Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) analysis performed at the national level and by ECDC found all isolates from the 18 cases within 2 allelic differences from each other (core genome MLST using Moura scheme, 1540 of 1748 loci detected in all 18 isolates). The latest case was reported in Denmark in February 2019 (Figure 1). [Figure 1: Distribution of Listeria monocytogenes isolates by country and time of reporting 2014-2019 (n=18) is available at the source URL. - Mod.ML]

A large-scale study led by ECDC on whole genome sequencing shows that most [listeriosis] outbreaks such as this one remain undetected. The study, published in 2018, suggests that more than half of the severe listeriosis cases in the European Union belong to clusters, many of which are not being picked up fast enough by the current surveillance system.

_Listeria monocytogenes_ causes listeriosis, which primarily affects pregnant women, newborns, and adults with a weakened immune system. Listeriosis is a relatively rare but potentially severe food-borne disease that has been reported in increasing numbers in the EU/EEA countries since 2008. In 2016, 2536 cases were reported, including 247 deaths. [See moderator comments below]

[The ECDC reported the following (https://ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/zoonotic-diseases-progress-has-stalled):
"Cases of listeriosis decreased slightly in 2017: 2480 infections were reported, against 2509 in 2016. However, the trend has been upward over the past 5 years. The group most affected by the disease in 2017 was the elderly, particularly those over 84. In this age group, the listeriosis fatality rate was 24%, while overall in the EU, the infection was fatal for one in every 10 patients. The highest levels of _Listeria monocytogenes_ were detected in fish and fishery products (6%), followed by ready-to-eat salads (4.2%)."

ProMED-mail recently posted a report of this listeriosis outbreak in Denmark (see ProMED-mail post Listeriosis - Europe: Denmark, fatal, WGS, smoked fish, ex Estonia, 2016-19). Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of _Listeria monocytogenes_ isolates by the ECDC and EU countries have identified clusters of patients with _Listeria_ infection who have isolates with similar genotypes in 4 additional countries, which implies they have the same source. In Denmark, based on interviews with patients and after finding _Listeria_ in samples taken from the Danish importer, the source of infection for the Danish cluster has been designated to be cold-smoked trout and salmon products produced in Estonia.

In the USA, a similar system identifies clusters of possibly related cases based on clinical isolates of _Listeria monocytogenes_, usually from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, tissue from a normally sterile site, or products of conception (such as amniotic fluid, placental, or fetal tissue) that have similar genotypes. These isolates had been forwarded to state public health laboratories for genotyping, the results of which had been submitted to PulseNet, the National Molecular Subtyping Network for Foodborne Disease Surveillance (https://www.cdc.gov/pulsenet/outbreak-detection/index.html). When PulseNet identifies a cluster of _L. monocytogenes_ patient isolates with the same molecular pattern, epidemiologists conduct a preliminary case-control analysis by comparing responses to food exposures reported on the Listeria Case Report from patients in the cluster to identify a common source.

Once a cluster is identified, PulseNet also works with other federal food regulatory agencies - the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA/FSIS) - to find isolates found in food monitoring programs that have similar genotypes, which would implicate them as a common source. - Mod.ML
