[This outbreak goes toward explaining the previous report from Azerbaijan which had no livestock cases but frequent human cases. I think we might presume in this instance that a number of sheep died and/or it was down the street from a veterinarian's office. A characteristic of any sheep death is that singular cases get ignored and help is requested only when the number affected is a dozen or more. Only one carcass made its way to the diagnostic laboratory. - Mod.MHJ
