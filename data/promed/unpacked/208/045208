Food Cited in N.Y. Illness Mystery
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

YONKERS, N.Y. (AP) -- Six people became suddenly and violently ill in an
apartment, sparking a chemical-contamination scare that led to the
evacuation of the building and the deployment of hazardous materials
workers and anti-terrorist agents.

Officials said later that the illness was probably caused by something in
the victims' food, but the outbreak was still being treated as a possible
crime.

``We're leaning toward some kind of food poisoning because of the violent
way they got sick,'' Police Commissioner Charles Cola said Friday. He
mentioned botulism as one disease that might match the symptoms.

Two people were in critical condition and on life support, Mayor John
Spencer said. The others were listed as stable, said Dr. Nicholas
DeRobertis of St. Joseph's Medical Center.

``It's definitely something they ingested, that they ate or drank, but we
don't know what,'' he said. Tests that might determine the cause of the
illness would not be finished until much later Friday, the hospital said.

The hospital closed briefly when emergency room workers reported rashes
that may have been caused by contact with the victims. But tests showed no
airborne contamination or contagion, Spencer said. He urged residents to be
calm, saying, ``It looks like everything is going to be all right.''

The New York City anti-terrorism task force was called in Thursday night
``due to the sensitivity of it and the times we live in,'' the mayor said.

Spencer initially said the illness seemed to be caused by ``some kind of
poison,'' and cyanide was considered a possibility. Cola said the victims'
conditions deteriorated quickly.

The victims, whose names were not released, had eaten together in the
apartment less than a mile north of the New York city line. Other people in
the apartment who had not eaten did not become ill, the mayor said.

Residents of the 18-unit building, including several children, were taken
to an auditorium and tended by Red Cross workers until police allowed them
to return home before dawn.

[Initial reports on this outbreak were pointing a finger at cyanide
poisoning as the etiology, justifying the speculation based on the rapidity
of decline of the cases involved. None of the press reports encountered
thus far have provided specifics on the clinical syndromes of the cases to
permit any sort of differential diagnostic discussion. The above press
report mentions the possibility of botulism as the etiology. Rather than
go the route of adding to speculation a request for additional information
is being made here. - Mod.MPP]
