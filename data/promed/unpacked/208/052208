State media reported late on Monday afternoon [8 Apr 2013], 3 new cases of H7N9 avian influenza in eastern China, one of them fatal, bringing the total number of deaths in the country to 7.

Shanghai authorities confirmed that a 64-year-old retiree was killed by the H7N9 virus, bringing the total number of infection-related deaths in the city to 5.

The government said the man died Sunday night [7 Apr 2013], a week after first experiencing chills. He sought medical treatment last Wednesday [3 Apr 2013] for pneumonia-like conditions. By Sunday morning [7 Apr 2013], his condition worsened, he was out of breath and was admitted to a ward for in-patient treatment. He died hours later and was diagnosed with H7N9 posthumously.

In addition to the death in Shanghai, 2 new cases of H7N9 virus infection were reported in Jiangsu province; an 85-year-old male retiree and a 25-year-old unemployed female.

The new death in Shanghai and 2 new cases in Jiangsu bring the total number of H7N9 human infection cases in eastern China to 24.

In Hong Kong, 7 new suspected cases of bird flu were undergoing tests for confirmation. 2 earlier suspected cases tested negative for the virus which had previously not been known to infect humans.

The World Health Organisation said on Monday [8 Apr 2013] that there is currently no proof that the H7N9 bird flu virus is being transmitted between people in China.

Taiwan's disease control authority said Monday [8 Apr 2013] that 4 of 7 suspected human infections of H7N9 bird flu that were reported over the last 24 hours have been ruled out, although the remaining 3 cases are still being tested.

Since 3 Apr 2013, 27 suspected cases have been reported on the island, with 24 of the patients testing negative for the virus, Chang Feng-yee, chief of the island's disease control authority, said at a press conference. However, Chang did not provide details about the 3 people who are still undergoing tests.

The island has enhanced surveillance and intensified the sanitization of poultry farms as preventative efforts against the H7N9 bird flu, as the mainland has reported an increasing number of cases.

Human infection with influenza A(H7N9) virus in China - update 7 Apr 2013
-------------
As of [7 Apr 2013] (16:30 CET), the Chinese health authorities notified WHO of an additional 3 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with influenza A(H7N9) virus.

The 1st patient is a 59-year-old man resident of Shanghai, who became ill on [25 Mar 2013], and is now in critical condition. The 2nd patient is a 55-year-old man from Anhui who became ill on [28 Mar 2013], and is now in stable condition. The 3rd patient is a 67-year-old man from Shanghai who became ill on [29 Mar 2013], and is considered a mild case.

To date, a total of 21 cases have been laboratory confirmed with influenza A(H7N9) virus in China, including 6 deaths, 12 severe cases and 3 mild cases. [note the additional cases mentioned in the above newswires that have been confirmed according to the press reports.

More than 530 close contacts of the confirmed cases are being closely monitored. In Jiangsu, investigation is ongoing into a contact of an earlier confirmed case who developed symptoms of illness.

The Chinese government is actively investigating this event and has heightened disease surveillance. Retrospective testing of recently reported cases with severe respiratory infection may uncover additional cases that were previously unrecognized. An inter-government task force has been formally established, with the National Health and Family Planning Commission leading the coordination along with the Ministry of Agriculture and other key ministries. The animal health sector has intensified investigations into the possible sources and reservoirs of the virus.

WHO is in contact with national authorities and is following the event closely. The WHO-coordinated international response is also focusing on work with WHO Collaborating Centres for Reference and Research on Influenza and other partners to ensure that information is available and that materials are developed for diagnosis and treatment and vaccine development. No vaccine is currently available for this subtype of the influenza virus. Preliminary test results provided by the WHO Collaborating Centre in China suggest that the virus is susceptible to the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir).

At this time there is no evidence of ongoing human-to-human transmission.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied.

[Overall from these reports it appears that the total number of human cases of avian A/(H7N9) influenza virus infection in Eastern China appears to have risen to 24 (see part [3] above) and the number of fatalities to 7 (see part [3] above). Most of the patients have been middle aged or elderly. However a four-year-old boy who was confirmed to be infected with the H7N9 bird flu on Thu 4 Apr 2013 has recovered indicating that not every human H7N9 infection is severe (see: CCTV reort at http://english.cntv.cn/20130408/104385.shtml). No human cases have been confirmed outside mainland China. The infection appears to be contracted directly from birds and no case of transmission from person-to-person has been observed. - Mod.CP]
