YELLOW FEVER - LIBERIA: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
***********************************************
A ProMED-mail post
<http://www.promedmail.org>
ProMED-mail is a program of the
International Society for Infectious Diseases

Date: 20 Feb 2004
From: ProMED-mail<promed@promedmail.org>

ProMED has heard from a usually reliable source that there is an
outbreak of yellow fever, with some deaths, in Liberia.
This was to be expected, since Liberia has suffered outbreaks of YF
almost every year since ProMED began reporting; in 2003 there were
outbreaks in 3 West African countries that share borders with Liberia
(see refs. below).
Please send any reports you find on the current outbreak to
<promed@promedmail.org>.
