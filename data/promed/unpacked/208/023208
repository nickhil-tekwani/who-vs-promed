South Korea confirms new foot-and-mouth outbreaks
-------------------------------------------------
South Korea reported 2 additional outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease
[FMD] at farms in the country's north on Sat 16 Jan 2010, bringing the
total number of outbreaks in a week to 4, an official said. A total of
8 cows at 2 farms in Pocheon, just north of Seoul, tested positive for
the disease, Agriculture Ministry official Lee Sang-soo said. All 124
cows on the farms were slaughtered as a precaution.

The 2 farms are a short distance from another farm where 6 cows were
confirmed to have been infected with the disease on 7 Jan 2010 --
South Korea's 1st outbreak since May 2002, Lee said. South Korea has
so far slaughtered some 3100 animals since that outbreak to prevent
the spread of the disease, said Lee.

FMD is often fatal [see comment] for cloven-hoofed animals including
cows, sheep, pigs and goats, causing blisters on the mouth and feet.
It does not affect humans.

The disease last hit South Korea in 2002 when some 160 000 pigs either
died of the disease or were slaughtered to prevent its spread.

[The following points deserve consideration:

1. Where and when have 3100 animals been culled 'to prevent the spread
of the disease?' And, which species was involved?

2. FMD is regarded a fatal disease only in reference to offspring
(very young animals), where the fatality rate may at times (and with
certain virus strains) exceed 50 percent. In adult animals (bovine,
ovine, caprine, porcine) the mortality will rarely exceed 5 percent,
though economic loses may be indeed massive.

3. In contrast to the 2002 epizootic, when pigs were the most
seriously affected species (see further), the current FMDV serotype A
strain seems to affect mainly, if not exclusively, cows. More details
in this respect are anticipated from South Korea as well as from other
East Asian countries recently affected by a rather similar virus,
particularly China.

The following summary information on the 2002 outbreak, derived from
posting 20020812.5027, may be of interest:

"Altogether, 16 foci were reported, 15 of them in pigs and one in
cattle, the 1st focus detected on 4 May [2002], the last one on 23
June [2002]. The causative virus was initially (10 May 2002) reported
as "FMD virus Pan-Asian type O1" and later (31 May 2002) "to be
different from the causative agent responsible for the 2000 outbreak."
According to the initial and follow-up reports, 52 784 pigs, 116
cattle, and 9 deer were destroyed on 13 of the infected premises
(details from the last 3 farms were missing). As a preemptive measure,
the Korean Veterinary Services destroyed, on 100 farms, the following
numbers of animals within 500 meters and/or a 3km radius around the
foci: 70 320 pigs, 282 cattle, and 16 goats. The severe measures,
promptly applied, have enabled them to prevent spread and to eradicate
the outbreak without use of vaccine, which reportedly remained
prohibited."

S.Korea still refrains from vaccinating in order to regain at the
earliest date its FMD-free status, officially recognised by the OIE,
and consequently be able to renew exports as soon as the outbreak is
eradicated and the country declared free of FMD.

In view of the proximity of the current cases to the North Korean
border, information on the FMD situation there is essential;
particularly, since South Korea tries to refrain from vaccination. The
virus which was involved in the 2007 outbreak in North Korea was
eventually found to be of serotype Asia 1; it is probable that
currently other virus(es) may circulate there, in particular the FMDV
A strain of the "ASIA" topotype, similar to the South Korean isolate.
Similar "ASIA" topotype strains have been identified in Thailand, Viet
Nam and in China by the WRLFMD [World Reference Laboratory for FMD,
Pirbright,UK]; the Chinese strain 'A-HuBWH-09' was received at
Pirbright on 25 Jan 2009. - Mod.AS]
