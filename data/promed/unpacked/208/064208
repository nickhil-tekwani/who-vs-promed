In the 1st 9 months of the year [2013], 45 Cambodian children have died from dengue fever, down 71 per cent compared with the 157 deaths over the same period last year, a health official said Thursday [10 Oct 2013].

About 15 193 dengue fever cases were reported during the January-September 2013 period this year, down 59 percent from the 36 958 cases over the same period last year, Dr. Char Meng Chuor, director of the National Center for Parasitology, Entomology and Malaria Control, said in a news release.

"Around 67 percent of the patients are children aged between 5-14," he said. He attributed the decline in infections and death toll to the ministry's efforts in educating people about the dangers of the disease and urging them to sleep under mosquito nets all the time.

Dengue fever is a viral disease transmitted by _Aedes_ mosquitoes. The disease causes an acute illness of sudden onset that usually follows symptoms such as headache, fever, exhaustion, severe muscle and joint pain, swollen glands, vomiting and rash.

The outbreak of dengue fever usually begins at the onset of the rainy season in May and lasts until October.

The country reported 42 362 dengue fever cases last year [2012], killing 189 children.

[According to the newswire, Cambodia has experienced a 70 percent decrease in the number of dengue fever cases during the 1st 9 months of this year [2013], compared to last year [2012].

The World Health Organization (WHO), Emerging Disease Surveillance and Response Dengue Situation Update, dated 2 Oct 2013, reports that dengue fever cases in Cambodia are decreasing and have recently reached a low level.

The update states that the weekly trend continued to decrease based on a 3-week moving average. 168 cases were reported in the week of 11-17 Sep 2013, compared to 1294 cases in the same week for 2012. A total of 14 592 cases (44 deaths) were reported through 17 Sep 2013. See http://www.wpro.who.int/emerging_diseases/DengueSituationUpdates/en/.

[This moderator was unable to find anything in the literature to support the use of bed nets as a primary means of control of dengue fever transmission. In an article by Tsuzuki et al, the authors did not demonstrate a decrease in incidence of DHF in children using bed nets during daytime naps.

Abstract: "The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of bed net use and elucidate the effect of daytime bed net use on preventing dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) among children in Viet Nam. We conducted a population-based cross-sectional survey and a matched case-control study in Khanh Hoa Province where not only some pre-schoolchildren but also some school children who take a nap during lunch break prior to returning to school used bed nets during the day. Among 36 901 children 2-10 years of age, most used untreated bed nets during the night (98.3 percent) compared with 8.4 percent during the day. The results of the case-control study, which defined 151 cases who were hospitalized with DHF in the provincial hospitals and 604 age-matched neighborhood controls, did not support our hypothesis that children using untreated bed nets during the day are less likely to be hospitalized with DHF (adjusted odds ratio = 0.56, 95 percent confidence interval = 0.23-1.39)." (Tsuzuki A, Thiem VD, Suzuki M, Yanai H, Matsubayashi T, Yoshida LM, Tho le H, Minh TT, Anh DD, Kilgore PE, Takagi M, Ariyoshi K. Can daytime use of bed nets not treated with insecticide reduce the risk of dengue hemorrhagic fever among children in Vietnam? Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2010 Jun;82(6):1157-9. available at http://www.ajtmh.org/content/82/6/1157.long#ref-list-1).

The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes, while traditionally thought of as feeding at dawn and dusk, have clearly been demonstrated to feed throughout the day. Hence, the use of bed nets as a primary means of dengue fever transmission control is questionable, as the human-mosquito interaction does occur throughout the day.

A review of dengue surveillance data from Cambodia available on the WHO/WPRO website demonstrates that 2007 and 2012 were high incidence dengue years according to annual reports, whereas 2013, while significantly fewer cases were reported than in 2012, is still showing significant dengue activity. The influence of possible changes in disease surveillance and reporting cannot be determined from the available reports, so conclusions on these observations are guarded.

Reported cases of dengue by year, Cambodia 2000-2013:
2000 3145
2001 10 266
2002 12 441
2003 12 081
