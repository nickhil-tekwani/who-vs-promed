Shanghai will require certificates of inspection on all pork and live hogs
that are shipped into the city from other parts of China, city agricultural
officials said on Tuesday. The move, effective on Wednesday on a trial
basis and formally implemented on October 1, would be aimed at ensuring the
quality of all pork products consumed in the big east China city. The
official said that pork products and live hogs would have to be certified
by designated government departments as being from epidemic-free areas.
Pork would have to be processed by registered provincial or municipal
slaughterhouses, examined by quarantine authorities above the county level
and transported by vehicles with refrigerating equipment, the Liberation
Daily said.
Some inspections were being made at present but not uniformly applied and
problems were too hard to trace.
The same official said Nantong in nearby Jiangsu province had been
discovered to be affected by an animal epidemic. He declined to give
further details.
A health official in Nantong, contacted by telephone, said there were no
problems with live hogs or pork from that area. He declined further comment.
