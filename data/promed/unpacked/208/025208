Livestock Vaccinated Against Anthrax
----------------------------------------------------
Agriculture officials have vaccinated livestock in the areas outside
Queen Elizabeth National Park against anthrax to prevent it from
spreading. The death toll for the hippos that have been hit by a
fresh outbreak of anthrax in the park has risen to 23 from 20.
Anthrax killed various species of wild animals, including about 200
hippos in the park last year.
The commissioner in charge of livestock health in the agriculture
ministry, Dr. Nicholas Kauta, on Tuesday said the livestock in the
most vulnerable areas near the park had been vaccinated.

[In the New Year there were reports of some 19 hippos dying of anthrax in
the Queen Elizabeth National Park. In spite of repeated efforts it was
impossible to get confirmation from the Ugandan authorities, so it was not
posted. Apparently the '05 death toll has now risen to 23 dead hippos. And
surrounding livestock at risk have been vaccinated. As it is not unusual to
find cattle being grazed within National Park boundaries in Africa this is
patently a wise thing to do. - Mod.MHJ]
