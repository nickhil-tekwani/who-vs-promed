-------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
The SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern omicron has increased infectivity and immune escape compared with previous variants. Despite the fact that a vast majority (~90%) of the population of Santa Fe city (Argentina) had been vaccinated and/or had been infected by SARS-CoV-2 prior to the arrival of omicron, the epidemic wave caused by this variant was by far the largest one experienced in the city. Nevertheless, the severity was much lower than that of previous waves. A serosurvey conducted within a month prior to the arrival of omicron allowed us to assess the humoural defences preceding the wave and to evaluate their consequences on infection risk and severity. Santa Fe is a city of 430 000 inhabitants, the survey was conducted on 1452 citizens, 514 of which were followed-up until March 2022. A high proportion of the sampled individuals had immunological memory against COVID-19 at the arrival of omicron (almost 90%), many of whom had high antibody levels. The anti-spike IgG titres were strongly associated with the number of vaccine shots and the vaccine platform received, and also depended markedly on prior COVID-19 diagnosis and the days elapsed since last antigen exposure (vaccine shot or natural infection). In turn, various analytical approaches consistently showed that preceding antibody titres were strongly correlated with COVID-19 incidence and severity of symptoms during the omicron-dominant wave. Also, receiving a vaccine shot during the wave reduced the COVID-19 risk drastically (15-fold). Here we present real world data showing that COVID-19 incidence and severity during the omicron-dominant wave was lowest in individuals with high antibody levels, which highlight the importance of maintaining high defences through vaccination in the presence of immune-escaping variants.

Discussion
----------
Prior studies have shown increased antibody evasion and greater breakthrough infection risk of omicron, compared with previous variants (Mannar et al, 2022; Hu et al, 2022). However, although reduced, the binding of IgG antibodies to the omicron spike antigen is maintained, and recent data suggests that extraneutralising antibodies contribute to disease control (Bartsch et al., 2022). This partial immune escape implicates that higher defence levels would be required to reduce the risk and severity of COVID-19 caused by the omicron variant. Here we present evidence of this with real world data. Anti-spike IgG levels and variables that cause antibodies to rise (i.e. prior COVID-19 and a recent boost shot) or are associated with higher antibody levels (i.e. days from last antigen exposure) were strong drivers of COVID-19 risk and severity. Our results strongly suggest that to reduce the impact of highly transmissible and immune-escaping variants like omicron, there is need of keeping the defences high. Therefore, booster vaccine shots in anticipating or during the emergence of an epidemic wave are highly recommended.

In conclusion, the arrival of the omicron variant caused the largest COVID-19 epidemic experienced in Santa Fe city since the beginning of the pandemic, but the case fatality observed was 10-fold lower than that of previous waves. The increased number of cases may be caused by the immune escape and high transmissibility of omicron while the high immune defences existing in the population at the time of its arrival most likely contributed the low impact observed. Disease risk and severity was lowest in individuals with high antibody levels, which highlights the importance of maintaining high defences through vaccination in the presence of immune-escaping variants.

-------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
To understand reinfection rates and correlates of protection for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), we established 8 different longitudinal cohorts in 2020 under the umbrella of the PARIS (Protection Associated with Rapid Immunity to SARS-CoV-2)/SPARTA (SARS SeroPrevalence And Respiratory Tract Assessment) studies. Here, we describe the PARIS/SPARTA cohorts, the harmonized assays and analysis that are performed across the cohorts, as well as case definitions for SARS-CoV-2 infection and reinfection that have been established by the team of PARIS/SPARTA investigators.

Importance - Determining reinfection rates and correlates of protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection induced by both natural infection and vaccination is of high significance for the prevention and control of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Furthermore, understanding reinfections or infections after vaccination and the role immune escape plays in these scenarios will inform the need for updates of the current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and help update guidelines suitable for the postpandemic world.

Introduction
------------
We established several longitudinal cohorts under the umbrella of the PARIS (Protection Associated with Rapid Immunity to SARS-CoV-2) and SPARTA (SARS SeroPrevalence And Respiratory Tract Assessment) studies to address the question of SARS-CoV-2 antibody durability and efficacy (for example, protection against reinfection). These human cohorts were initially designed to compare the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infection in seropositive to seronegative participants, thus pinpointing correlates of protection in the context of natural infection. With the rapid SARS-CoV-2 vaccine rollouts starting in mid-December 2020 in the United States, many of our cohorts also now track immune responses to vaccination in both seronegative and seropositive individuals at the time of immunization. These natural infection/vaccine cohorts will help to establish correlates of protection after natural infection and vaccination and inform about vaccine-induced immunity to newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of interest/concern.

The coronavirus pandemic is not over yet, Germany's health minister warned on Thursday [19 May 2022] as the country's highest court approved rules requiring health workers to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Health minister Karl Lauterbach noted the sharp rise in cases currently happening in some Asian countries, such as North Korea, but also parts of Europe.

"In Germany, too, an average of 130-150 people are dying every day due to the pandemic," Lauterbach told reporters in Berlin. "So the impression that the pandemic has been defeated is wrong." Lauterbach was holding a 2-day meeting with his counterparts from the Group of Seven leading democracies on Thursday and Friday [19 and 20 May 2022].

[3] Vaccine: booster

CDC recommends Pfizer COVID boosters for kids ages 5 to 11
----------------------------------------------------------
Amid a steady rise in US COVID-19 cases led by a more transmissible subvariant, vaccine advisers for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) today [19 May 2022] recommended a booster dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for children ages 5 though 11.

ACIP goes with stronger option
------------------------------
Earlier this week, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the vaccine booster for emergency use in younger children. The move follows an early January [2022] recommendation for booster doses for kids in older age-groups. [https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/05/fda-oks-pfizer-boosters-kids-who-weighs-second-boosters]

CDC experts today [19 May 2022] said 35.4% of children ages 5 through 11 have had at least one COVID vaccine dose. Though researchers haven't had much time to track waning protection of vaccinated younger kids, they have shown protection waning over time after 2 doses in children ages 12 and older.

Given uncertainties about the limited numbers of kids in the younger age-group in the booster-dose clinical group and the timing of vaccination regarding a possible fall and winter wave, members of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) grappled with whether to say younger kids "may" or "should" get the 3rd dose.

Many members of the group said they thought the "may" recommendation would help with clearer messaging about the booster dose and align the booster recommendation with that for other age groups, including older kids. Some members, though, were swayed by the idea of boosters given closer to fall, while others said messages about kids' COVID-19 vaccination should be more targeted to ensure that kids receive their primary series.

At today's meeting [19 May 2022], the recommendation passed with 11 yes votes, 1 no vote, and 1 abstention. The booster would be given as the same smaller 10-microgram dose that is administered for the primary series and would be given at least 5 months after the 2nd dose.

Third doses are already recommended for immunocompromised kids ages 5 through 11, who are now recommended to get a 4th dose. The CDC director still needs to sign off on ACIP's recommendation before booster doses roll out to kids ages 5 through 11.

[Also note that the IDSA supports pediatric boosters (https://www.idsociety.org/)

"The Infectious Diseases Society of America supports decisions by the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to recommend COVID-19 vaccine booster shots for children ages 5-11 who have already completed the 2-shot primary series. This is welcome news as COVID-19 cases have been rising quickly across the country, and data show the booster provides needed protection. ..." (communicated by: Mary Marshall)]

[4] North Korea
Date: Thu 19 May 2022
Source: CBS News [abridged, edited]
https://www.cbsnews.com/news/north-korea-suspected-covid-19-caseload-2-million/


The official Korean Central News Agency said more than 1.98 million people have become sick with fever since late April [2022]. At least 740 160 people are in quarantine, the news agency reported.

Workers were mobilized to find people with suspected COVID-19 symptoms who were then sent to quarantine -- the main method of curbing the outbreak since North Korea is short of medical supplies and intensive care units that lowered COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths in other nations.

State media images showed health workers in hazmat suits guarding Pyongyang's closed-off streets, disinfecting buildings and streets and delivering food and other supplies to apartment blocks.

Despite the vast numbers of sick people and the efforts to curb the outbreak, state media describe large groups of workers continuing to gather at farms, mining facilities, power stations and construction sites. Experts say North Korea cannot afford a lockdown that would hinder production in an economy already broken by mismanagement, crippling U.S.-led sanctions over Kim's nuclear weapons ambitions and pandemic border closures.

North Korea also must urgently work to protect its crops from a drought that hit during the crucial rice-planting season -- a worrisome development in a country that has long suffered from food insecurity. State media also said Kim's trophy construction projects, including the building of 10 000 new houses in the town of Hwasong, are being "propelled as scheduled."

"All sectors of the national economy are stepping up the production to the maximum while strictly observing the anti-epidemic steps taken by the party and the state," Korean Central News Agency reported.

The virus controls at workplaces include separating workers by their job classifications and quarantining worker units at construction sites and in its key metal, chemical, electricity and coal industries, KCNA said.

While Pyongyang says more than 1.2 million people have already recovered, it's clear officials are simply releasing people from shelters or other quarantine facilities like schools after their fevers subside, according to South Korean lawmaker Ha Tae-keung, who attributed the information to the spy agency briefing. Although the North may lack medical equipment, it does seem to have enough thermometers to check temperatures, likely imported from China, Ha said.

Kee Park, a global health specialist at Harvard Medical School who has worked on health care projects in North Korea, said the country's number of new cases should start to slow because of the strengthened preventive measures. But it will be challenging for North Korea to provide treatment for the already large number of people with COVID-19. Deaths may possibly approach tens of thousands, considering the size of its caseload, and international assistance would be crucial, Park said. "The best way to prevent these deaths is to treat with antivirals like Paxlovid," which would significantly lower the risk of severe disease or death, Park said. "This is much faster and easier to implement than sending ventilators to build ICU capacity."

Other experts say providing a small number of vaccines for high-risk groups such as the elderly would prevent deaths, though mass vaccinations would be impossible at this stage for the population of 26 million. It's unclear, however, if North Korea would accept outside help. It already shunned vaccines offered by the U.N.-backed COVAX distribution program, and the nation's leaders have expressed confidence the country can overcome the crisis on its own.

Kim Tae-hyo, deputy national security adviser for South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, told reporters on Thursday [19 May 2022] that North Korea has ignored offers of help from South Korea and the United States to contain the outbreak.

[In the past 24 hours, 11 countries -- USA (106 334), Taiwan (89 420), Germany (56 446), Australia (51 477), Japan (41 527), Italy (30 722), France (27 842), the UK (25 275), South Korea (25 108), Finland (11 485), and Brazil (10 415) -- all reported more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 2261 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 17 May 2022 to late 18 May 2022).

A total of 30 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 16 of the 30 countries are from the European region, 5 are from the Americas region, none is from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, 2 from the South East Asia region, and 1 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 32.6%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 1.4%. Comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 21.3% increase in daily reported cases and a 1.3% increase in reported deaths. This shows an overall global trend of decreasing cases and deaths.

Impression: Worldwide over 0.82 million newly confirmed infections were reported in the past 24 hours. The cumulative totals exceed 525.86 million reported cases and 6.29 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
