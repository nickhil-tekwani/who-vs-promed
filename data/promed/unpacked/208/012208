Scientists say the invasive northern snakehead fish carries bacteria that could harm other creatures.

The US Geological Survey [USGS] says some snakeheads caught in Virginia waters of the Potomac River south of Washington were infected with an unknown species of mycobacteria.

Mycobacteria can cause chronic disease in a variety of animals, including mammals. But Virginia state fisheries biologist John Odenkirk said there is no indication of a health risk to people who eat infected snakeheads that have been cooked.

USGS veterinarian Christine Densmore says more research is needed to determine the potential effects of the bacteria on the snakehead population and other species.

The predatory fish can breathe air and survive on land. They've been reported in at least 9 states since they were discovered in California in 1977.

[Mycobacteria are a family of small, rod-shaped bacilli that can be classified into 3 main groups: _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ complex, _M. leprae_, and non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM).

One NTM reported infecting fish is _Mycobacterium marinum_, a slow-growing environmental mycobacterium that was first isolated from dead fish in a Philadelphia aquarium in 1926 and was identified as a human pathogen in 1951 after isolation from granulomatous skin lesions.

_M. marinum_ is distributed widely in aquatic environments, especially in relatively still or stagnant water, such as in fish tanks and swimming pools, and in naturally occurring bodies of water. The results of the characterization of this new isolate from snakeheads will clarify to which group it belongs.

The northern snakehead is native to Asia and is one of 29 snakehead species (_Channa argus_). For a picture go to https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Snakehead_-_Channa_argus.jpg. It was found in 2002 in Crofton, Maryland. 2 years later, snakeheads were found in the Potomac River.
