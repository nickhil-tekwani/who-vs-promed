Epidemiological unit: Farm

Affected animals
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Goats / 15000 / 312 / 312 / 0 / 0

Affected Population
Goats of local breed showed respiratory distress with high mortality
and no response to treatment.

Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1

Outbreak statistics

Species / Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate /
Apparent case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*

Goats / 2.08 percent / 2.08 percent / 100.00 percent / 2.08 percent

* Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction
and/or slaughter

Epidemiology

Epidemiological comments
The laboratory diagnosis of the Animal Health Laboratory of Mauritius
revealed the presence of _Pasteurella_ sps. and _E. Coli_ sps. Since
the mortality in goats kept increasing until mid August 2009, samples
were collected and sent to the United Kingdom Reference Laboratory,
Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA), from where the result was
confirmed by PCR on 30 Sep 2009.

Severe respiratory symptoms were often noticed in goats in the post
cyclonic season and in winters; the cases of mortality are more
noticed on the west coast and in the northern part of the island.

Control measures

Measures applied
Quarantine
Movement control inside the country
Screening
Zoning
Disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s)

[The disease has appeared for the 1st time in Mauritius with a
mortality rate of 100 percent in local goats without any response to
treatment. Contagious caprine pleuropneumonia (CCPP) is one of the
most serious diseases of goats affecting the respiratory system. It
is extremely contagious and often very lethal with high morbidity
rates among virgin/naive flocks of up to 100 percent and mortality
rates up to 80 percent. It is of economic importance in Africa,
especially amongst the rural population who keep large herds of sheep
and goats, which constitute their major source of revenue. The
treatment of choice in affected herds is Tylosine and
Chlortetracycline, even though it was reported that there was no
response to treatment in the last outbreak. A vaccine is also
available which confers immunity of over 12 months.

[This posting was originally carried on our ProMED-mail East African
regional list. CCPP is caused by a mycoplasma organism that is
similar to the one that causes contagious bovine plueropneumonia
(CBPP). CBPP was the target of the United States 1st disease
eradication campaign, successfully mounted in 1884 by Daniel Elmer
Salmon, the founder of USDA's veterinary services. Both CBPP and CCPP
continue to cause problems for livestock production in Africa and
elsewhere. - Mod.PC]
