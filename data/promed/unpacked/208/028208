Davao's banana growers alarmed by Panama disease
-------------------------------------------------
Stakeholders of the banana industry in Davao Region were alarmed over
the onset of the dreaded Panama Disease, which has already affected
several banana plantations. "It is an industry killer and for
Mindanao, an economy killer," Alex Valoria, Philippine Banana Growers
and Exporters Association (PBGEA), said of the destructive fungal
plant disease.

The fungus has been identified as the recent strain Tropical Race 4.
Presently, it has no cure and cannot be controlled by fungicide.
According to Stephen Antig, PBGEA, the disease was spotted in Calinan
in Davao City about 3 years ago. It has spread to banana plantations
in Compostela Valley, Davao del Norte and Davao del Sur. "It is a very
virulent disease and is a very fast-killer," he said.

Antig estimates a significant impact by the infestation particularly
to small growers. In Mindanao, there are about 245 000 hectares [605
408 acres] planted to bananas. This industry could be threatened.

Fungus could wipe out Philippine bananas
-----------------------------------------
A disease called Fusarium wilt has already infected 1200 hectares of
banana plantations locally, said Stephen Antig, Pilipino Banana
Growers and Exporters Association (PBGEA). "If we can not contain
this, then in less than 3 years our banana industry will die."

The Philippines is the 2nd biggest exporter of bananas in the world
behind Ecuador with about 70 000 hectares [172 973 acres] of
plantations. The banana sector is also the country's 5th largest
export industry, directly employing 280 000 people. The Philippines
exports the Cavendish variety which is the most popular type around
the world, according to Antig. The disease destroyed Cavendish
plantations in Indonesia and Malaysia in the 1990s.

Traces of the fungus were found in controllable levels in the
Philippines 5 years ago, Antig said. But a more virulent type of the
fungus emerged recently and quickly began spreading in the southern
region of Mindanao, where most of the country's banana exports come
from, he said.

Antig urged the government to fast-track the creation of a research
institute to enable local growers to develop a fruit variety that is
resistant to the disease.

[Panama disease of banana (PD, also called fungal or fusarium wilt) is
caused by the soilborne fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_ f.sp. _cubense_.
Symptoms include yellowing, wilting and streaking of pseudostem, and
affected plants die rapidly. The pathogen is spread by infected
planting material, mechanical means (including people and insect
activities), soil and water. It can survive in the soil for decades,
and consequently crop rotation with non-hosts is not likely to control
the disease effectively.

Disease management for PD is difficult and mostly relies on
phytosanitation for pathogen exclusion. No effective chemical or
cultural control measures are available, and integrated approaches
have been developed (ProMED-mail post 20090419.1483) which may include
cultural practices, certified clean planting material and biocontrol
agents. Breeding programmes and molecular techniques are being used to
develop crop cultivars with increased resistance to the different
fungal strains. Constant vigilance is required in areas where the
fungus is present to prevent flare-ups and recognise emerging new
strains.

Several races of the pathogen exist. Races 1 and 2 attack several
different cultivars of eating and cooking bananas (plantains), but
Cavendish varieties were initially not affected; race 3 attacks
ornamental _Heliconia_ species only; temperate race 4 and the recently
emerged tropical race 4 (TR4) attack cultivars in the Cavendish
subgroup as well as hosts of races 1 and 2. Until now, TR4 was
considered the most serious pathogen strain, however, a new strain of
race 1 affecting Cavendish bananas was reported recently in India
(ProMED-mail post 20101223.4510) adding considerably to the threat
posed by PD to banana industries.

In the Philippines, PD was 1st reported in 1920 from northern and
central areas. It was confirmed in commercial Cavendish in the mid
1970s in southern Mindanao, and this probably indicates the arrival of
TR4. It is not clear how the pathogen race in the new outbreak
reported above was identified, but if it was solely based on the fact
that Cavendish varieties are affected, the outbreak could be due to
either a flare up of the previously recorded TR4, the emergence of a
new variant of TR4, or a TR1 strain affecting Cavendish similar or
identical to the one emerging in India.

Cavendish is a group of banana cultivars with a triploid genome
derived from _Musa acuminata_ (AAA). The majority of today's
cultivated bananas are related to either _M. acuminata_ (A) and/or _M.
balbisiana_ (B) and mostly sterile. The specific genetic background of
a variety is indicated by the letters A or B.
