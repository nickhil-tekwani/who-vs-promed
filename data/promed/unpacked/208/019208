The number of syphilis cases is rising in the province, a coordinator with New Brunswick [Canada] Public Health said. The Student Health Centre is also dealing with a number of new cases.

"Our practitioners at the Student Health Centre have not noticed a change in the rate of STIs [sexually transmitted infections], with the exception that we are now seeing cases of syphilis," said Stacey Taylor, a nurse practitioner at the Student Health Centre.

Karen Wilson, communicable disease coordinator with New Brunswick Public Health, says that the province is currently in outbreak mode for syphilis. Wilson says that an outbreak is a term used when rates are significantly higher than normal. Between 2010 and 2011, syphilis rates almost doubled among people aged 20 to 24. The data from Public Health is preliminary, unpublished, and was retrieved from the system in October 2011.

Syphilis progresses through 4 stages, and symptoms of this infection may include a sore on the genital area, rashes or red spots on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, hair loss, fever and sore throat, and muscle and joint aches. Syphilis is curable with antibiotics, usually by injecting penicillin into the infected person.

Factsheets from the government of New Brunswick say that the people most at risk for sexually transmitted infections are those under 25 who are sexually active with multiple partners. Wilson encouraged all people who are sexually active to practice safer sex by always using protection and getting tested for sexually transmitted infections regularly.

More information about sexually transmitted infections can be found on the government of New Brunswick's website on the right-hand side of their health department page.

New Brunswick (NB) [Canada] is continuing to experience an outbreak of infectious syphilis. 14 new cases have been reported (as of 17 Mar 2011) in 2011, and a total of 37 cases were reported across the province in 2010. Prior to 2008, less than 5 cases were typically reported in NB per year. The outbreak initially began in the Moncton area in late 2009 and 2010 but has more recently shifted to the Fredericton region. Sporadic cases have also been reported in Saint John and northern New Brunswick. An epidemic curve is shown in Figure 2 [Figure 2 is available at the website.].

The majority of cases continue to be male, most of whom are men who have sex with men (MSM). A small number of female cases have been reported, including 2 cases in pregnant women. Most cases were aged 20-24 and 40-44 years with a mean age of 33.7 years and median age of 33 years (range: 17 to 60 years). Many individuals reported having multiple sex partners in the last year, including casual and/or anonymous partners. At least 5 of the cases are co-infected with HIV.

Over the past 10 years, an increase in the rate of infectious syphilis has been observed across Canada. In 1993, the national rate was 0.6 per 100 000 and was similar among males and females. This rate remained relatively constant until 2001, at which point, the incidence of infectious syphilis cases began to rise. In 2010, the national rate was estimated as 5.0 per 100 000 (the same as in NB) with a significantly higher rate observed among males than females [1,2]. Contributing to this overall increase, outbreaks of infectious syphilis have been noted in population subgroups in urban Canadian centers. These outbreaks have largely been observed among MSM [3,4]. However, a shift to heterosexual population groups (and consequently including congenital cases) has also been seen [4]. Other high-risk groups for syphilis outbreaks include sex trade workers, patrons of sex trade workers, and injection drug users [5]. The incidence of infectious syphilis among Aboriginal people has also been disproportionately high in some regions [6].

The Office of the Chief Medical Officer of Health (OCMOH) in NB has responded to the outbreak of infectious syphilis through increased communication with physicians and other health care providers. Two letters have been distributed to clinicians (December 2010 and February 2011) to increase diagnostic alert and to emphasize the importance of syphilis and other STI testing, management, and counseling of patients who present to clinics. Clinicians should continue to refer patients to Public Health to ensure that contact tracing and follow-up with an enhanced surveillance questionnaire is conducted, and to continue to screen all pregnant women for syphilis at the 1st antenatal visit.

In February [2011], the OCMOH implemented a public awareness campaign that uses social media and marketing strategies to provide important testing information to high-risk groups across the province. The public is encouraged to visit http://www.gnb.ca/whoknew for further details.

[The following is extracted from the moderator's comments in ProMED-mail post Syphilis - USA, Canada 20081112.3561:

"In the USA, as the rate of primary and secondary (infectious) syphilis decreased among homosexual and bisexual males, largely because of changes in sexual behavior due to AIDS, a spike in the rate of infectious syphilis occurred in the late 1980s among heterosexual men, women, and neonates (congenital syphilis) that was attributed to an epidemic of crack cocaine use and exchange of sex for drugs. Cases of syphilis again dropped from 1990 to 2000. In 2000, the rate of primary and secondary syphilis in the United States was 2.1 cases per 100 000 population, the lowest since reporting began in 1941. From 2001 to 2004, the primary and secondary syphilis rate increased nationally to 2.7, primarily as a result of increases in cases among men who have sex with men (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5510a1.htm).

Prior ProMED-mail posts reported an upsurge in syphilis cases in New York City (Syphilis - USA (NY) 20070814.2650) and Indianapolis (Syphilis - USA: (IN) 20080826.2668) that centered among gay men. In New York City, the syphilis outbreak was associated with an increase in cases among women, who may have been having sex with bisexual men. Infectious syphilis in women can be followed by an increase in neonatal syphilis."

The infectious syphilis outbreak in New Brunswick, Canada is characterized as involving mainly males, most of whom are men who have sex with men (MSM). Many reported having multiple sex partners, including casual and/or anonymous partners, and at least 5 of the cases were co-infected with HIV. Reported increases in incidence of infectious syphilis among MSM have been characterized by high rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection, high-risk sexual behavior, use of drugs such as methamphetamines, and use of internet chat rooms to meet sex partners (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5510a1.htm). However, the current outbreak among students and others in New Brunswick, Canada is not fully characterized as to, for example, the use of drugs or the internet to meet sex partners, and requires a detailed epidemiologic investigation so that preventive measures can be targeted to specific high-risk groups, such as MSM, and practices."
