Bird Flu in Burma's Mon Province
-----------------------------------------
A United Nations official has confirmed a fresh outbreak of avian
influenza in the southern state of Mon, which borders Thailand in the
south of the country.
An adviser to the Burmese government with the Food and Agricultural
Organization (FAO) told RFA's Burmese service: "We have had an
outbreak in Mon state. [A total of] 500 chickens were culled, but it
is now under control."
The deadly H5N1 virus hit poultry in the Dawn Zayat quarter of
Maulmein township, sources in the region said. A 2nd outbreak was
also reported in Pa-An township in neighboring Karen State.
Outbreak said under control
-----------------------------
A veterinary team from the FAO's office in the former capital Rangoon
had left together with Burmese livestock officials for the area to
carry out a cull of poultry.
"Bird flu can spread in 3 ways: through the movement of poultry and
its products, through caged birds and the wild bird trade, and
through the migration of wild birds," Rangoon-based FAO expert Aung
Khin said. "But [in Burma] most cases are from the movement of
poultry and its products."
Burma's secretive military regime has confirmed the outbreak in
Maulmein, but so far no official announcement has been made regarding
the Karen state outbreak. There have been 2 outbreaks of bird flu in
Mon state already this summer [2007], which lies about 300 kms (180
miles) south of Rangoon [se ProMED refs. below].
Authorities in the central Burmese region of Bago announced an
outbreak of H5N1 among poultry in early August [2007], which started
among backyard chicken and ducks, experts said. Thousands of birds
were culled in Letpandan township in an attempt to contain that
outbreak, which was later confirmed as bird flu.
Agricultural teams were having trouble disposing of infected
carcasses during the rainy season, they said. "Since it is the rainy
season here, we are facing a lot of trouble in burying or destroying
the animals. When we dig the ground to bury them, all the water comes
out and the cost of fuel is too high to burn them, but we are doing
our best," he told reporter Khin Maung Soe.
Burmese authorities culled 660 000 birds last year [2006] to contain
the spread of the deadly virus [see ProMED refs. below], which has
ripped through Asian poultry flocks since 2003 and caused 319 cases
in humans, 192 of which were fatal.

[A map of the various states and division of Myanmar(Burma) may be seen at:
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdivisions_of_Myanmar>. The map is
worth inspection with the information in the article in mind. The
article indicates outbreaks in 3 locations Mon state (2 outbreaks),
Karen State which is also known more properly as Kayin state, and
Bago division. These locations take up a fair bit of central Myanmar.
The widespread nature of these 12 outbreaks, which were first
reported to OIE in late February of this year (2007) can be seen from
OIE's WAHID Event Summary page at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=4951>.
Inspection of this map indicates that while several of the outbreaks
are clustered closely together in Yangon (Rangoon), others are rather
spread out over the several states in the central region. Given this
distribution, any new information should be examined to see the rate
at which the distribution of the outbreaks changes, how far it
spreads and whether it will come to the threaten the lengthy border
shared with Thailand. Transparency in reporting is of course the key
to close monitoring. - Mod.PC]
