An acute, infectious virus spread by gnats is possibly responsible for the
deaths of "a few dozen" white-tailed deer in a western Indiana county, a
state wildlife biologist reported.
EHD -- epizootic hemorrhagic disease -- has been confirmed in deer in
Fountain. The disease, similar to bluetongue disease in sheep, causes high
fever, internal bleeding and is usually fatal.
"We've had some mortality," said Jim Mitchell of the Department of Natural
Resources (DNR). "So far, the number of reports has been limited to a few
dozen deer, but it remains to be seen how significant the outbreak is."
Mitchell said the last known outbreak of EHD in Indiana was in 1996, when
it was estimated several hundred to a few thousand deer died from the disease.
"It's not a cause for alarm in terms of human consumption of any deer,"
Mitchell said. "You're not going to catch it by handling, processing or
consuming deer."
EHD outbreaks typically occur in late summer or early fall. Illinois
officials cite dry summer and fall conditions as contributing factors for
an EHD outbreak in their state this year. Deer deaths attributed to EHD
have been confirmed in 4 Illinois counties and suspected in at least 5
others. The Illinois state veterinarian reported that all confirmed deaths
occurred in captive deer herds but suspected in the deaths of wild deer.
The Indiana Board of Animal Health has received no reports of EHD in
captive deer but is monitoring the situation, agency spokeswoman Denise
Derrer said.
EHD was first discovered in 1955 when several hundred white-tailed deer
died in Michigan and New Jersey. Since then, cases have been documented
throughout the northern United States and southern Canada.
"We really won't know the impact here until after the gun season," Mitchell
said.
If the EHD outbreak is more widespread than suspected, Mitchell said it
will result in an unexpected decline in the number of deer hunters kill
during the firearms season, which opens Saturday and runs through 28 Nov 2004.
Thus far, hunters have killed about the same number of deer during the
archery season as they did a year ago. Mitchell said the cumulative total
reported through Monday was 8865 deer compared to 8609 for the same period
in 2003.
Mitchell expects hunters will take slightly more deer this season than in
2003, when they killed 106 986, the 4th highest total ever and the most
since a record 123 086 deer were killed in 1996.
"We felt the herd was trending up in a few counties and stationary in many
counties," he said. "If there is any change, I expect there is a slightly
[larger] herd, and therefore a slightly [larger] harvest."

[The Indiana DNR has been conducting surveillance for this disease for some
time. There have been a few suspicious deaths, but confirmation was not
received until 11 Nov 2004 for EHD in wild deer. Currently there are no EHD
cases in captive cervid herds in Indiana. - Mod.TG]
