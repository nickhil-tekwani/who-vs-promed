The Papua New Guinea [PNG] Government has declared Sandaun or West Sepik province "a disease area" following the detection of the contagious Newcastle bird disease in the PNG-Indonesia border villages of Wutung and Musu and the provincial capital Vanimo. This means that the movement of poultry and poultry products out of Sandaun province is banned until further notice. However, commercially produced chicken meat and eggs entering the province from other PNG suppliers are exempted from the prohibition.

Agriculture and livestock minister Tommy Tomscoll announced the declaration and prohibition in a full page advertisement published in the country's daily newspapers.
According to minister Tomscoll, disease and deaths of village chicken started occurring in Wutung and Musu villages and around Vanimo on 4 Mar 2013. Reports reached National Agriculture Quarantine and Inspection Authority (NAQIA) on 11 Mar 2013.

NAQIA officers immediately conducted field investigations and collected blood and swab specimens from sick and recently dead birds and sent them to the Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL) in Victoria, Australia. A follow up investigation was conducted from 28 Mar to 4 Apr 2013 but no disease or deaths were reported in the affected villages. Further blood specimens were collected and sent to AAHL.

"On Thursday 11 Apr 2013, NAQIA received confirmation from AAHL that the samples from the original disease investigation in Wutung village have tested positive for Newcastle disease. This is confirmation that Newcastle disease is the cause of the sickness and deaths reported from Wutung," minister Tomscoll says in the advertisement.

"Given this situation, I as minister [am] responsible. [I] have declared Sandaun province a 'disease area' with respect to Newcastle disease under the National Gazette No G165 on 23 Apr 2013," he said. Tomscoll said NAQIA is drawing down contingency funds held in trust for avian influenza (bird flu) for the initial containment and surveillance activities. PNG's Poultry Industry Association has also committed to support NAQIA in the containment and surveillance activities, he said.

Meanwhile, speaking to Post-Courier from Vanimo, NAQIA's chief veterinarian, Dr Nimo Kapo who analysed samples, said indications are that the disease is closely related to a similar disease contracted from Indonesia. Newcastle disease is a highly contagious viral disease of domestic poultry, cage and aviary birds.

Newcastle disease is an acute viral disease of domestic poultry and many other bird species. It is a worldwide problem that presents primarily as a respiratory disease, but depression, nervous manifestations, or diarrhea may be the predominant clinical form. Mortality is variable. Occurrence of a virulent form of the disease is reportable and may result in trade restrictions.

Virulent NDV (Newcastle disease virus) strains are endemic in poultry in most of Asia, Africa, and some countries of North, Central, and South America. Other countries, including the USA and Canada, are free of those strains and maintain that status with import restrictions and eradication by destroying diseased poultry. Cormorants, pigeons, and imported psittacine species have also been sources of virulent NDV infections of poultry. Low virulence NDV is prevalent in poultry and wild birds, especially waterfowl. Infection of domestic poultry with low virulence NDV contributes to lower productivity.

Infected birds shed virus in exhaled air, respiratory discharges, and feces. Virus is shed during incubation, during the clinical stage, and for a varying but limited period during convalescence. Virus may also be present in eggs laid during clinical disease and in all parts of the carcass during acute virulent infections. Chickens are readily infected by aerosols and by ingesting contaminated water or food. Infected chickens are the primary source of virus, but other domestic and wild birds may be sources of NDV. Transfer of virus, especially in infective feces, by the movement of people and contaminated equipment is the main method of spread between poultry flocks.

Onset is rapid, and signs appear throughout the flock within 2-12 days (average 5) after aerosol exposure. Spread is slower if the fecal-oral route is the primary means of transmission, particularly for caged birds. Young birds are the most susceptible. Observed signs depend on whether the infecting virus has a predilection for respiratory, digestive, or nervous systems. Respiratory signs of gasping, coughing, sneezing, and rales predominate in low virulence infections. Nervous signs of tremors, paralyzed wings and legs, twisted necks, circling, clonic spasms, and complete paralysis may accompany, but usually follow, the respiratory signs in neurotropic velogenic disease.

Nervous signs with diarrhea are typical in pigeons, and nervous signs are frequently seen in cormorants and exotic bird species. Respiratory signs with depression, watery-greenish diarrhea, and swelling of the tissues of the head and neck are typical of the most virulent form of the disease, viscerotropic velogenic Newcastle disease (VVND, also called exotic Newcastle disease), although nervous signs may also be seen. Varying degrees of depression and inappetence are observed.
