The death toll due to the outbreak of Japanese encephalitis in Andhra
Pradesh has mounted to 105 on Wednesday. According to a health bulletin
issued by Director of Health Dr K S V Prasada Rao, 33 fresh cases of
encephalitis were reported on Wednesday, pushing up the total for the
current year to 516. The death toll due to the disease this year rose to
105 with five more children succumbing on Wednesday.
Since November 1, as many as 305 cases have been reported in the affected
districts with 53 deaths. Before November, 211 cases were reported with 52
fatalities. The medical authorities say that this is not "abnormal" since
the epidemic, which sets in September, peaks during October and November,
before tapering off in December. Gradually, the disease is spreading to
hitherto unaffected areas. Cases have been reported so far from 403
villages in a dozen districts, particularly Kurnool, Anantapur, Cuddapah,
Prakasam, Guntur, Warangal, Mahubnagar, Nalgonda, Karimnagar and Medak.
Despite the medical authorities taking up all preventive and curative
measures to control the disease, it has shown no signs of abatement.
