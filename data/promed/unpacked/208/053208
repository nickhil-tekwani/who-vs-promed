Urban expansion in Queensland's far north has been linked to an increase in cases of the potentially deadly soil-borne disease melioidosis.

Cairns Hospital has diagnosed almost 400 cases of the serious bacterial infection in the past 2 decades, with the annual incidence more than doubling in that time. In Cairns city itself, rates have increased 10-fold from 0.6 cases per 100 000 people to 6.6 per 100 000 population.

Infectious disease physician Simon Smith led a team that analyzed almost 300 Far North Queensland melioidosis infections diagnosed between 1998 and 2019 to determine their cause.

The research team looked at local climatic factors including rainfall, temperatures, cloud cover and cyclones during that time, but found no statistically significant change in climate to account for the big increase in melioidosis cases. Dr. Smith said while a jump in cases was usually associated with cyclone activity, there had only been 1 cyclone within 200 km [approx. 124 mi] of the study area in 2 decades. Instead, the researchers identified a link between the construction of a new motorway, south of Cairns, built in 2 stages from 2011 to 2017, and a rise in melioidosis numbers.

Before work began on the Cairns Southern Expressway in 2011, the researchers recorded 2 cases occurring within 2 km [approx. 1,24 mi] of the existing road during the study period. However, after the roadworks began, 27 cases were identified within 2 km [approx. 1,24 mi] of the highway construction.

Dr. Smith said the motorway was built predominantly through alluvial plain soils, with moderate clay content and poor drainage, favoring growth of melioidosis bacteria. "The hypothesis is that because these bacteria live in around 30 to 60 cm of soil, they're more likely to come to the surface either when it's raining or when soil is turned over," Dr. Smith said. "If we're churning over more soil, it gives more opportunities for the bacteria to be there on the surface and then for people to be exposed either through people walking through churned over, muddy soil, or by inhalation."

Dr. Smith said work was underway to improve awareness of melioidosis among people living in the region, given a 3rd of people who developed the notifiable disease ended up in intensive care and 10% died. Melioidosis is uncommon in healthy adults and rarely seen in children. People with diabetes, kidney problems, chronic lung disease, cancer patients, those who drink too much alcohol and people on medication that suppresses the immune system are prone to developing the infection.

"The biggest lesson to learn from this project is that anyone working in soil or muddy water, particularly after heavy rains, should wear footwear and use gloves while working outdoors," Dr Smith said. "Any open wounds, lesions or burns should be protected from coming into contact with potentially contaminated soil or water, through the use of waterproof dressings."

Melioidosis symptoms include a fever, cough and difficulty breathing. Sometimes the disease may present as superficial skin infections or abscesses.

The research is published in the Emerging Infectious Diseases, a journal of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Most of the cases of melioidosis in Australia occur in the Northern Territory, but Queensland is also in the northern aspect of this island nation, east of Northern Territory.

Melioidosis is a disease of the rainy season in its endemic areas. It mainly affects people who have direct contact with soil and water. Many have an underlying predisposing condition such as diabetes (commonest risk factor), renal disease, cirrhosis, thalassemia, alcohol dependence, immunosuppressive therapy, chronic obstructive lung disease, cystic fibrosis, and excess kava consumption. Kava is an herbal member of the pepper family that can be associated with chronic liver disease.

Melioidosis may present at any age, but peaks in the 4th and 5th decades of life, affecting men more than women. In addition, although severe fulminating infection can and does occur in healthy individuals, severe disease and fatalities are much less common in those without risk factors.

The most commonly recognized presentation of melioidosis is pneumonia, associated with high fever, significant muscle aches, chest pain, and -- although the cough can be nonproductive -- respiratory secretions can be purulent, significant in quantity, and associated with on-and-off bright, red blood. The lung infection can be rapidly fatal -- with bacteremia and shock -- or somewhat more indolent.

Acute melioidosis septicemia is the most severe complication of the infection. It presents as a typical sepsis syndrome with hypotension, high cardiac output, and low systemic vascular resistance. In many cases, a primary focus in the soft tissues or lung can be found. The syndrome, usually in patients with risk factor comorbidities, is characteristically associated with multiple abscesses involving the cutaneous tissues, the lung, the liver, and spleen, and a very high mortality rate of 80-95%. With prompt optimal therapy, the case fatality rate can be decreased to 40-50%.

The melioidosis bacillus is intrinsically insensitive to many antimicrobials. It should be noted that bioterrorism strains may be engineered to be even more resistant. _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ is usually inhibited by tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT), antipseudomonal penicillins, carbapenems, ceftazidime, and amoxicillin/clavulanate or ampicillin/sulbactam. Ceftriaxone and cefotaxime have good in vitro activity but poor efficacy and cefepime did not appear, as well, to be equivalent to ceftazidime in a mouse model. The unusual antimicrobial profile of resistance to colistin and polymyxin B and the aminoglycosides but sensitivity to amoxicillin/clavulanate is a useful tool to consider in treatment of infection with the organism.

The randomized and quasi-randomized trials comparing melioidosis treatment have been reviewed, and it was found that the formerly standard therapy of chloramphenicol, doxycycline, and SXT combination had a higher mortality rate than therapy with ceftazidime, imipenem/cilastatin, or amoxicillin/clavulanate (or ampicillin/sulbactam). The betalactam-betalactamase inhibitor therapy, however, seemed to have a higher failure rate.
