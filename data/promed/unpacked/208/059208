Foot-and-mouth disease found in cattle in Tibet
-----------------------------------------------
Cattle in southwest Tibet Autonomous Region were found with
foot-and-mouth disease [FMD], the country's Ministry of Agriculture
(MOA) said Monday [5 Sep 2011].

The virus was detected in 233 cattle in Gyaca county of Shannan
Prefecture in Tibet on 31 Aug 2011, with 6 dying from it, the MOA
said, adding that test results revealed Monday that the cattle were
carrying the O type virus.

All infected cattle and another 1744 raised together have been killed
and properly disposed of, it said. The epidemic has been effectively
contained, the MOA said.

[The above outbreak has been reported by China to the OIE on Tue 6 Sep
2011, in follow-up report Number 21; available, with a map showings
the outbreak's location, at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=10980.
According to the report, the figures are different from those in the
above press article: the Tibet farm included 1744 susceptible cattle,
of which 6 were cases, 6 died, 1738 destroyed.

The epizootic, caused by FMD serotype O, had started on 2 Feb 2010, so
far causing 23 reported outbreaks, spread over major parts of China; a
map with all accumulated foci is available at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=8988.

According to China's reports, including the current follow-up report,
the measures applied to control the disease include stamping-out and
"no vaccination." On the other hand, China's annual report for 2010
says that routine vaccination is included among the control measures
against FMD in cattle, sheep/goats and swine. For the report, see
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=control&disease_type=Terrestrial&disease_id=1&selected_start_year=2010&selected_report_period=2.
A clarification, and -- in case vaccination is applied -- numbers of
vaccinated animals and information on the vaccination status in
affected farms, are requested.

On the other hand, if "stamping out, no vaccination" policy is indeed
and exclusively applied, its efficiency deserves to be revisited in
view of the fact that new outbreaks continue to appear more than one
and a half year after the start of the epizootic, covering vast parts
of China.
