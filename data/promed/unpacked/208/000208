Health authorities say as many as 12 additional cases of hepatitis discovered in Sweden can likely be traced back to the same virus strain that epidemiologists have linked to frozen berries 1st discovered in Denmark. Since December 2012, 56 cases of hepatitis A have been reported in Sweden, more than 10 times the normal number of cases for the same time period, according to the Svenska Dagbladet (SvD) newspaper.

While 8 of the Swedish cases have been confirmed to be the same strain from a similar outbreak in Denmark, Danish health officials believe an additional 12 Swedish cases are also likely linked to the same strain of hepatitis A [virus] that is thought to have originated in frozen berries. "We think the source is a large batch of frozen berries from one producer that has spread across the Nordic region," Swedish National Food Agency (Livsmedelsverket) spokesman Mats Lindblad told the TT news agency. He said it was difficult, however, to pinpoint disease-carrying batches. "It's like finding a needle in a haystack, because there only needs to be a very small amount of the virus for it to spread."

Last week, the agency warned Swedes that they should make sure they cook berries they buy frozen in the supermarket to make sure there is no risk of infection. Denmark and Finland had both already warned their consumers of the risk and asked that people take precautions in how they eat store-bought berries. Already in 2009, Finnish authorities asked that consumers make sure to boil raspberries. Denmark legislated back in 2001 that cafes and restaurants had to do the same if the raspberries were imported.

Experts with the Swedish Institute for Communicable Disease Control (Smittskyddsinstitutet, SMI) advised berry lovers to take caution when consuming any berries bought in Sweden that were sold frozen. "If you cook them for at least one minute, then all the contagion will die or be inactivated," Margareta Lofdahl, epidemiologist from the Swedish Communicable Disease Institute, told the TT news agency at the time. "This cooking advice applies to all kinds of frozen berries from all suppliers. This is the safest option until we find out more."

On Tuesday [30 Apr 2013], the agency announced that 10 cases of hepatitis A have been linked to the strain in the Danish outbreak, with an additional 7 cases suspected of being linked. Tests run by the agency indicate that there is no evidence that Swedish consumers should shy away from any particular kind of berry. Hepatitis A can lead to liver damage. The most recent case in Sweden was reported on 6 Apr 2013.

[The recommendation for cooking berries before consumption applies only to berries that have been packaged and sold frozen. Fresh berried fruits are likely to be produced locally and are consumed soon after harvesting. Frozen berries are likely to be imported. Earlier reports of hepatitis A virus infection associated with berried fruits in Nordic countries indicated that the contaminated berries originated from the Middle East (Egypt), where hepatitis A contamination of the environment could be considerable. It is surprising that this information appears to have been ignored in Sweden up to the present. - Mod.CP
