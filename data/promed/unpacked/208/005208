Abstract
--------
Importance: Remdesivir demonstrated clinical benefit in a placebo-controlled trial in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but its effect in patients with moderate disease is unknown.

Objective: To determine the efficacy of 5 or 10 days of remdesivir treatment compared with standard care on clinical status on day 11 after initiation of treatment.

Design, Setting, and Participants: Randomized, open-label trial of hospitalized patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and moderate COVID-19 pneumonia (pulmonary infiltrates and room-air oxygen saturation greater than 94%) enrolled from 15 Mar through 18 Apr 2020 at 105 hospitals in the United States, Europe, and Asia. The date of final follow-up was 20 May 2020.

Interventions: Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a 10-day course of remdesivir (n = 197), a 5-day course of remdesivir (n = 199), or standard care (n = 200). Remdesivir was dosed intravenously at 200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg/d.

Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary endpoint was clinical status on day 11 on a 7-point ordinal scale ranging from death (category 1) to discharged (category 7). Differences between remdesivir treatment groups and standard care were calculated using proportional odds models and expressed as odds ratios. An odds ratio greater than 1 indicates difference in clinical status distribution toward category 7 for the remdesivir group vs the standard care group.

Results: Among 596 patients who were randomized, 584 began the study and received remdesivir or continued standard care (median age, 57 [interquartile range, 46-66] years; 227 [39%] women; 56% had cardiovascular disease, 42% hypertension, and 40% diabetes), and 533 (91%) completed the trial. Median length of treatment was 5 days for patients in the 5-day remdesivir group and 6 days for patients in the 10-day remdesivir group. On day 11, patients in the 5-day remdesivir group had statistically significantly higher odds of a better clinical status distribution than those receiving standard care (odds ratio, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.09-2.48; P = .02). The clinical status distribution on day 11 between the 10-day remdesivir and standard care groups was not significantly different (P = .18 by Wilcoxon rank sum test). By day 28, 9 patients had died: 2 (1%) in the 5-day remdesivir group, 3 (2%) in the 10-day remdesivir group, and 4 (2%) in the standard care group. Nausea (10% vs 3%), hypokalemia (6% vs 2%), and headache (5% vs 3%) were more frequent among remdesivir-treated patients compared with standard care.

Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with moderate COVID-19, those randomized to a 10-day course of remdesivir did not have a statistically significant difference in clinical status compared with standard care at 11 days after initiation of treatment. Patients randomized to a 5-day course of remdesivir had a statistically significant difference in clinical status compared with standard care, but the difference was of uncertain clinical importance.

[Remdesivir is a nucleotide prodrug whose active metabolite inhibits viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, structurally conserved enzymes that play a key role in the replication of a broad range of viruses, including Coronaviridae [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32516797/]. A 1st randomized, placebo-controlled trial of remdesivir among patients with COVID-19 conducted in Wuhan, China, could not complete enrollment to meaningfully assess efficacy [Lancet. 2020; 395(10236): 1569-1578. doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31022-9]. However, in a larger randomized, double-blind clinical trial, patients with severe COVID-19 treated with a 10-day course of remdesivir had a significantly shorter time to recovery than those receiving placebo (11 days vs 15 days) [N Engl J Med. Published online 22 May 2020. doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2007764]. Subsequently, a randomized, open-label trial showed that patients with severe COVID-19 with relative hypoxia or requiring oxygen support but not requiring ventilatory support had outcomes with 5- and 10-day courses of remdesivir that were not significantly different [N Engl J Med. Published online 27 May 2020. doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2015301].

These results prompted the US Food and Drug Administration to grant emergency use authorization of remdesivir for patients with severe COVID-19 and the European Medicines Agency to grant conditional marketing authorization to remdesivir for treatment of COVID-19 in patients 12 years of age or older with pneumonia who require supplemental oxygen.

In spite of all these studies, additional information is required to understand fully the effectiveness of the drug in SARS-CoV-2 treatment in view of variables such as patient's clinical status at the time of initiating treatment, dosage regimens etc.

The authors of the study conclude that "among patients with moderate COVID-19, those randomized to a 10-day course of remdesivir did not have a statistically significant difference in clinical status compared with standard care at 11 days after initiation of treatment. Patients randomized to a 5-day course of remdesivir had a statistically significant difference in clinical status compared with standard care, but the difference was of uncertain clinical importance." Indeed, many areas of uncertainty prevail. - Mod.UBA]

- 12:45 GMT - Israel's coronavirus chief urges Ukraine to ban Jewish pilgrimage.
The head of Israel's coronavirus task force has asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to ban an annual pilgrimage in which Hasidic Jews visit the central Ukrainian town of Uman over concerns the site may become a virus hotspot. Tens of thousands of Hasidic Jews descend on Uman every Jewish New Year to visit the grave of Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, who revived the Hasidic movement and died in 1810.
"A gathering of this sort, at such troubled times, is expected to generate mass events of infection of tourists and local Ukrainian residents, turning into a heavy burden on local medical systems, while thousands more are expected to come back to Israel and further spread the virus," Ronni Gamzu said. This year [2020], Jewish New Year celebrations run from 18-20 Sep [2020].

- 12:05 GMT - More than half of Spanish companies reopen after closing at height of pandemic.
More than half the companies in Spain that closed at the height of the coronavirus pandemic have reopened, according to government data released on Saturday [22 Aug 2020], suggesting the economy is recovering slowly.
The number of companies registered to pay social security by the end of July [2020] was 1 282 346, according to figures from the Ministry of Inclusion, Social Security and Migration, or 91 240 fewer firms than in February [2020] before the government imposed a strict lockdown to try to contain COVID-19. However, the statistics showed that since the easing of lockdown started in May [2020], 49 159 companies have registered with the government. This is just over half the number that closed when the pandemic was at its height in March and April [2020].

- 11:20 GMT - France delays launch of COVID-19 economic reboot plan to September [2020].
The French government said on Saturday [22 Aug 2020] it would unveil details of its EUR 100 billion [USD 118 billion] plan to reinvigorate the economy in the 1st week of September [2020], instead of next Tuesday [25 Aug 2020], as it focuses on preparing the new school term.
"The recovery plan is ready, the timetable for its implementation still stands," government spokesman Gabriel Attal said in a statement.
Schools are set to reopen on 1 Sep [2020] after most were closed during a 2-month lockdown earlier this year [2020] to fight the coronavirus, and the government is working to ensure protective measures will be adequate, Attal said.

- 10:45 GMT - Argentina joins Chinese coronavirus vaccine trial, maker says.
Argentina joined Peru, Morocco, and the United Arab Emirates in approving Phase 3 clinical trials for a coronavirus vaccine developed by China National Biotec Group (CNBG), the company said late Friday [21 Aug 2020].
As China forges ahead in the global race to develop a vaccine to curb the COVID-19 pandemic, and as cases within China dwindle, CNBG needs research participants from other countries for testing.
Scientists develop a vaccine against the coronavirus disease in Saint Petersburg.
Phase 3 trials, which usually involve several thousand participants, allow researchers to gather data on the efficacy of potential vaccines for final regulatory approvals [Anton Vaganov/Reuters].

- 0:10 GMT - Qatar reports 284 infections.
Qatar confirmed 284 new coronavirus cases on Saturday [22 Aug 2020], taking the country's total to 116 765.
The country's public health ministry said 315 people recovered from the virus in the last 24 hours. At least 113 531 recovered from coronavirus in the Middle Eastern country. As of Saturday, 193 people have died from the virus in Qatar [Karim Jaafar/AFP].

- 09:40 GMT - Philippines reports 4933 infections, 26 deaths.
The Philippines reported 4933 infections of the new coronavirus on Saturday [22 Aug 2020], the 5th straight day above 4000, and 26 COVID-19 deaths.
In a bulletin, the health ministry said total confirmed cases have increased to 187 249 while confirmed deaths have reached 2966.
The Philippines has the most infections in Southeast Asia, and 2nd-highest number of deaths, behind Indonesia [Aaron Favila].

- 09:15 GMT - Coronavirus cases in India approach 3 million.
India reported a record daily jump of coronavirus infections on Saturday [22 Aug 2020], bringing the total near 3 million and piling pressure on authorities to curb huge gatherings as a major religious festival began.
The 69 878 new infections -- the 4th straight day above 60 000 -- take India's total cases to 2.98 million, behind only the United States and Brazil.
COVID-19 deaths increased by 945 to 55 794, data from the federal health ministry showed. Almost 70 000 new cases reported in India where more than 55 000 people have died of the coronavirus [Francis Mascarenhas/Reuters].

- 08:15 GMT - Russia's coronavirus infection tally passes 950 000.
Russia reported 4921 new coronavirus cases on Saturday [22 Aug 2020], pushing its confirmed national tally up to 951 897. Authorities said 121 people had died of COVID-19 over the last 24 hours, raising the official death toll to 16 310.

- 07:45 GMT - Czech authorities report 506 new cases in record daily increase.
The Czech authorities recorded 506 new coronavirus cases on Friday [21 Aug 2020], the highest number of new infections in one day since the outbreak began there.
Czech has so far reported 21 551 confirmed cases of the virus, with 411 deaths, including 19 over the past week. The Czech government was among the 1st in Europe to introduce curbs on movement and business as the outbreak took hold. It began to lift restrictions in May [2020] but has reintroduced some measures as cases rose in recent weeks.
- 07:05 GMT - Germany reports more than 2000 cases.
The number of coronavirus infections in Germany surpassed 2000 in the previous 24 hours, a high not seen since the end of April [2020], authorities said on Saturday [22 Aug 2020].

- 06:40 GMT - Ukraine reports daily record 2328 infections.
Ukraine registered a record 2328 cases of the new coronavirus in the past 24 hours, officials said on Saturday [22 Aug 2020]. The data given by the national council of security and defence surpassed the previous single-day record of 2134, reported on Thursday [20 Aug 2020]. Total cases are at 102 971, with 2244 COVID-19 deaths.
Infections have risen sharply in Ukraine in recent days [Fabrizio Bensch/Reuters].

- 06:25 GMT - Travelers from France to UK must self-certify no coronavirus symptoms.
Travelers from France to the United Kingdom will be required to self-certify that they are not suffering coronavirus symptoms or have been in contact with a confirmed case within 14 days preceding travel, the British government said.
The United Kingdom has said travelers returning from France on or after 15 Aug [2020] should self-isolate upon their return due to high COVID-19 infection rates in France. The imposition of quarantine conditions has hit Britons' favourite holiday destinations in the middle of summer and as the travel industry fights for survival. Other countries including Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Croatia, and Austria are already on the UK's quarantine list [Peter Nicholls [Reuters]].

- 04:24 GMT - Moderna says more than 40% of participants enrolled for vaccine trial.
Drug developer Moderna Inc says it has so far enrolled 13 194 participants in the continuing late-stage 30 000-volunteer US trial testing its COVID-19 vaccine candidate. In a tweet, the company also said 18% of the participants currently enrolled are Black, Latino, American Indian, or Alaska Native, groups among the hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic.
Moderna began the study of its vaccine candidate, mRNA-1273, in July [2020] and expects to complete enrolment in September [2020].

- 03:46 GMT - South Korea orders nationwide restrictions.
South Korea has banned large gatherings, shut down nightspots and churches, and removed fans from professional sports nationwide in an attempt to slow a resurgence of coronavirus infections. Health Minister Park Neung-hoo announced the new measures after officials reported 332 newly confirmed cases, marking the 9th straight day of triple-digit increases.
Most of the new cases were in the Seoul metropolitan area, which has been at the centre of the viral surge of recent weeks. But infections were also reported in practically every major city and in towns across the country.
The government had already imposed the tighter restrictions in the capital region earlier this week, a move they resisted for months out of economic concerns.

- 02:43 GMT - Australia's Victoria reports 13 deaths, 182 cases
Australia's 2nd-most populous state, Victoria, has reported 13 new coronavirus deaths in the past 24 hours, authorities said, while new infections in the hotspot state remain below 200 for the 2nd consecutive day.
"It's great to see 2 days in a row under 200; certainly, we are trending down," said Brett Sutton, the state's chief health officer. "The best way to safeguard against a 3rd wave is to bring that number down to the lowest feasible, possible level."
The state reported 182 new cases on Saturday [22 Aug 2020], up from the 179 new cases and 9 deaths a day earlier, but down from more than 700 a day 2 weeks ago.

- 01:53 GMT - Boeing testing hand-held UV wand to sanitise cockpits, cabins.
Boeing Co said it is developing a hand-held wand that emits ultraviolet light to neutralise bacteria and viruses, part of a suite of methods to disinfect flight deck surfaces and controls as well as surfaces throughout the cabin. The wand would eliminate the need for using alcohol or other disinfectants that could damage sensitive electronic equipment, Rae Lutters, chief engineer for Boeing's ecoDemonstrator programme, told a media briefing.

- 01:18 GMT - Biden says he will shut down US if experts said to.
Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, says he would do whatever was needed to keep the US safe amid the coronavirus pandemic even if that meant shutting down the country.
"I will be prepared to do whatever it takes to save lives because we cannot get the country moving until we control the virus," Biden said in an interview with ABC. "In order to keep the country running and moving and the economy growing, and people employed, you have to fix the virus, you have to deal with the virus." And if scientists recommended shutting down the country, "I would shut it down," Biden added.
The interview airs on Sunday night [23 Aug 2020], but clips were provided on Friday [21 Aug 2020].

- 00:58 GMT - US closes lanes, adds checks at Mexico border.
The US has closed lanes at select ports of entry at the border with Mexico and will conduct more secondary checks to limit non-essential travel and the spread of coronavirus, according to a US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) official. Non-essential travel has been restricted at the border since March [2020], but the curbs have mostly been applied to Mexican citizens. The new measures appeared to be aimed at US citizens and legal residents living in Mexico.

"We need people to think twice about non-essential travel and to ask themselves if the travel is worth risking their lives and the lives of others," El Paso CBP spokesman Roger Maier said in a written statement.

- 00:36 GMT - Nigeria to bar entry for citizens of countries that block Nigerians.
Hadi Sirika, Nigeria's aviation minister, told airline and travel industry representatives the Nigerian government will bar entry to nationals of countries that impose travel bans on Nigerians during the coronavirus pandemic.
"If they ban both the passengers and the carriers together, then that's what's going to happen," Sirika said on a Zoom call. "Our numbers are not equal to the numbers we've seen in Europe," Sirika said, adding that with travel bans, "we feel that it is discriminating against our people."
Nigeria has 50 951 confirmed coronavirus cases and 992 deaths.

- 00:20 GMT - South Africa's cases breach 600 000 mark.
South Africa has reported 3398 new COVID-19 cases in the past 24 hours, taking the country's total to 603 338 infections. The new figures mark a sharp decline in cases, compared with a peak of more than 13 000 infections a day seen in July [2020]. South Africa now accounts for more than half of Africa's cases, and its death toll, 12 483, makes up about 47% of the continent's deaths.
"We believe that South Africa is in a way moving past the point of the peak of the pandemic; we believe we have gone beyond the inflexion point," Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said on Wednesday [19 Aug 2020].

[These countries had been selected based on having had significant surges of SARS-CoV-2 infections but different responses. In some cases, transmission was almost interrupted, but resurgences have occurred, and countries have handled them differently. One observation is that lifting of restrictions has led to major resurgences in some areas; in others, early new threats seem to be importations, but community spread does recur. Good contact tracing has helped to shorten the time with new clusters, and temporary new restrictions have had an impact. Countries not implementing restrictions have done more poorly, with major resurgences and more widespread community-based transmission.

In South Korea, it looks like major transmission is continuing. Previously, when there were major events, time-limited increased restrictions were implemented; as of today, 22 Aug 2020, they are being implemented again. A key takeaway message is that the virus is still circulating globally, and relaxing of the guard (eliminating simple measures of social distancing, face masks, hand washing, and large gatherings) is an open invitation for the virus to re-enter with clusters of cases and ultimately community transmission. - Mods.MPP/UBA]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

Data by country, area, or territory can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesAug22_1598187506.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 49.2% of daily case numbers and 63.5% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, maintaining its dominance as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 12.1 million cases. Brazil and the USA continue to dominate, followed by Colombia, Peru, Argentina, and Mexico.

- The European region reported 13.5% of daily case numbers and 6.9% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours and total cumulative cases reported greater than 3.9 million. Spain is the dominant country and is followed by Russia, France, Ukraine, Israel, Turkey, Romania, and Poland.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 4.8% of daily case numbers and 5.3% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of greater than 1.8 million cases. Iraq continues to dominate, followed by Iran, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Kuwait, and Lebanon.

- The African region reported 2.7% of daily case numbers and 4.6% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.99 million cases. South Africa continues to dominate followed by Ethiopia, Nigeria, Kenya, and Algeria.

- The Western Pacific region reported 2.2% of daily case numbers and 1.4% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.44 million cases. The Philippines continues to dominate, followed by Japan, South Korea, and Australia. Viet Nam and New Zealand continue to report newly confirmed cases (2 and 6, respectively) following the new outbreaks identified in the past few weeks.

- The South East Asia region reported 27.2% of the daily newly reported cases and 18.5% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 3.38 million cases. India continues to be the driving force of the dominance of this region, followed by Bangladesh and Indonesia.

Impression: The overall picture is basically the same. The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed cases on a daily basis followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, followed by the Africa region, and the Western Pacific region representing the lowest daily caseload of all the regions. While regional proportions may not reflect this, most of the regions have countries with resurgences associated with lifting of restrictions.

On the overview tab at the WHO source URL, the epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases by WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 22 Aug 2020, is the same epidemic curve included in the previous situation updates and is an excellent visual representation of the epidemic as described in the text above. - Mod.UBA]

In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (70 068), followed by the Brazil (46 210), and USA (43 829) -- account for over half of all confirmed cases globally (61.1%). There were 5349 deaths reported in the past 24 hours (21-22 Aug 2020).

In descending rank order, India is number one for the number of newly confirmed in the past 24 hours, followed by the Brazil, USA, Colombia, Peru, Argentina, Mexico, Russia, Philippines, Iraq, South Africa, and France. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed goes from 3602 to 70 068. Other hotspots are seen in the countries numbered 11-20 in this list: Ukraine, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Iran, Chile, Morocco, Bolivia, Ethiopia, UK, and Israel; their range of reported new cases is 1217 to 2328. A total of 28 countries have reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is very little change in the average number of daily reported cases (a decrease of 0.98%), and looking at daily reported deaths, the change is increased by 2.3%. The key question remains as to whether transmission is in fact slowing down or whether these figures reflect reporting artifact seen surrounding weekends. Time will tell, but following the data reports showing major surges in countries that had been showing successes makes one wonder what is driving these reporting variances (we haven't changed our minds! We feel like a broken record here...).

Impression: Basically unchanged from previous discussions, the SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts and mortality, while the global 7-day averages seem to reflect a slowing down of reporting confirmed cases; however, I still wonder whether this is real or reflects a changing pattern with decreased testing or case reporting. For example, the USA reported data suggest a slowing down of transmission over the past 2 weeks as seen by the comparative 7-day averages in reported new cases (see section [3E] above), but if one looks at the percentage of positive PCR tests, in the past 3 weeks the positivity rate has been stable at 9%, consistent with significant ongoing transmission that is not abating (see https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html). The most severely affected region is the Americas, with increasing daily case counts, even though the comparative 7-day average suggests things may be slowing down (or reporting is slowing down). India also drives the next-most-affected region -- South East Asia -- with persistent high daily case reports. - Mod.UBA]
