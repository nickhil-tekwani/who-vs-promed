CDC is collaborating with public health and agriculture officials in
New York, New Jersey, other states, the Department of Agriculture's
Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS), and the Food and Drug
Administration to investigate a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella
[enterica_ serotype] Heidelberg infections linked to a kosher chicken
liver product labeled as "kosher broiled chicken livers," which is not
ready-to-eat and requires further cooking before eating. Public health
investigators are using DNA "fingerprints" of _Salmonella_ bacteria
obtained through diagnostic testing with pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis (PFGE) to identify cases of illness that may be part
of this outbreak. They are using data from PulseNet, the national
subtyping network made up of state and local public health
laboratories and federal food regulatory laboratories that performs
molecular surveillance of foodborne infections. Because the _S._
Heidelberg PFGE pattern associated with this outbreak commonly occurs
in the USA, some of the cases with this pattern may not be related to
this outbreak. Based on the previous 5 years of reports to PulseNet,
approximately 30-40 cases with the outbreak strain would be expected
to be reported per month in the USA. The outbreak strain is different
from another strain of _S._ Heidelberg associated with ground turkey
recalled earlier in 2011.

In August 2011, CDC identified a sustained increase in the number of
_S._ Heidelberg isolates with the outbreak strain reported to PulseNet
from New York and New Jersey. From 1 Apr to 4 Nov 2011, a total of 157
illnesses were reported in New York (93 cases) and New Jersey (64
cases). Based on the previous 5 years of reports to PulseNet, New York
and New Jersey would expect approximately 5 cases per month, but in
June through August 2011, these states experienced approximately 30-40
cases a month. No significant increase in the number of illnesses
above baseline was identified in other areas in the USA during this
period.

Among persons for whom information is available in New York and New
Jersey, illnesses began on or after 13 Mar 2011. Ill persons range in
age from less than 1 to 97 years with a median age of 10 years. 52
percent are female. Among the 125 ill persons with available
information, 21 (17 percent) have been hospitalized. No deaths have
been reported.

Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------------
Epidemiologic and laboratory investigations conducted by officials in
local, state, and federal public health, agriculture, and regulatory
agencies linked this outbreak to eating "kosher broiled chicken
livers" from Schreiber Processing Corporation (doing business as Alle
Processing Corporation/MealMart Company), and chopped chicken liver
prepared from this product. These "kosher broiled chicken livers" are
sold at retail stores and may be used as an ingredient in other
prepared foods. These products appear to be ready-to-eat, but are in
fact partially cooked, and therefore need to be fully cooked before
eating. Consumers may have incorrectly thought the use of the word
"broiled" in the label meant the chicken liver was ready-to-eat;
however, these chicken livers must be fully cooked before eating. Alle
Processing Corporation/MealMart Company is cooperating in the on-going
investigation.

Among 30 ill persons for whom information is available, 22 (73
percent) reported consuming chicken liver products in the week before
their illness began. Laboratory testing conducted by the New York
State Department of Agriculture and Markets Laboratory Division
identified the outbreak strain of _S._ Heidelberg in samples of
"kosher broiled chicken livers" and chopped liver products obtained
from retail stores.

New York City receives funding under the CDC FoodCORE (Foodborne
Diseases Centers for Outbreak Response Enhancement) program. FoodCORE
sites are supported in part by USDA-FSIS and the Association of Public
Health Laboratories. These sites work together to develop new and
better methods to detect, investigate, respond to, and control
multistate outbreaks of foodborne diseases. New York City conducted an
enhanced epidemiologic investigation, which resulted in the
identification of suspect food items that might have been a source of
this outbreak. These suspect food items were collected for testing and
the outbreak strain was found in "kosher broiled chicken liver"
products.

CDC and state and local public health partners are continuing
laboratory surveillance through PulseNet to identify and interview
additional ill persons and to interview ill persons about foods eaten
before becoming ill. FSIS is working closely with CDC and state
officials to determine where this product may have been distributed.

Recall information
------------------
On 8 Nov 2011, Schreiber Processing Corporation, of Maspeth, New York,
announced a voluntary recall of an undetermined amount of "kosher
broiled chicken liver" products.

[This is the formal CDC report on the outbreak. Much of the
contaminated vehicle is likely to be turned into "chopped liver," a
common Jewish food, often eaten on holiday occasions. A recipe for the
delicacy is reproduced below
http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ina-garten/chopped-liver-recipe/index.html:
Ingredients
2 pounds chicken livers
1 cup rendered chicken fat
2 cups medium-diced yellow onion (2 onions)
1/3 cup Madeira wine
4 extra-large eggs, hard-cooked, peeled, and chunked
1/4 cup minced fresh parsley leaves
2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
Pinch cayenne pepper

Directions
Drain the livers and saute them in 2 batches in 2 tablespoons of the
chicken fat over medium-high heat, turning once, for about 5 minutes,
or until just barely pink inside. Don't overcook the livers or they
will be dry. Transfer them to a large bowl.

In the same pan, saute the onions in 3 tablespoons of the chicken fat
over medium-high heat for about 10 minutes, or until browned. Add the
Madeira and deglaze the pan, scraping the sides, for about 15 seconds.
Pour into the bowl with the livers.

Add the eggs, parsley, thyme, salt, black pepper, cayenne, and the
remaining chicken fat to the bowl. Toss quickly to combine. Transfer
half the mixture to the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel
blade. Pulse 6 to 8 times, until coarsely chopped. Repeat with the
remaining mixture. Season, to taste, and chill. Serve on crackers or
matzo. - Mod.LL]
