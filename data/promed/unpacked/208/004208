An Afssa [Agence francaise de securite sanitaire des aliments]
laboratory is contaminated with _Bacillus anthracis_; 5 laboratory
workers have been placed in isolation in a hospital at Maison-Alfort
after being in contact with the bacillus. The incident occurred at
the laboratory, which works in conjunction with the National
reference lab for anthrax (Centre national de reference charbon (CNR
charbon)) located in the Pasteur Institute. CNR charbon carries out
epidemiologic surveillance on anthrax and characterizes the isolates
from cases and outbreaks.

[This report does not give any information on the nature of this
exposure in a laboratory studying animal pathology and zoonotic
infections. One can only guess what happened. Speculatively, someone
might have dropped a glass container with a liquid culture, and the
fear is that this produced an aerosol in the room. A properly
designed laboratory should have negative air pressure [with
high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters] so that what happens
in the laboratory stays in the laboratory. Hopefully, the medical
authorities took nasal swabs to determine which of the workers were
in fact exposed. We look forward to seeing a more definitive account
of the events and the nature of the exposure. - Mod.MHJ]

[Another report at the same URL states the 5 laboratory workers have
been released from isolation. - Mod.JW]
