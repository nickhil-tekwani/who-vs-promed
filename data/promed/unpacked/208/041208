The Simcoe Muskoka District Health Unit (SMDHU) is currently investigating an increase in Legionnaires' disease cases in Barrie. Four cases of Legionnaires' disease have been confirmed recently in individuals who reside in the city; in the past 6 years the health unit has seen on average 2 cases annually in Barrie residents.

"It's not uncommon to see cases of Legionnaires' disease in Simcoe Muskoka; however seeing this number at an unusual time of year for the bacteria warrants further investigation," said Dr. Charles Gardner, medical officer of health for SMDHU. [Most cases of Legionnaires' disease are seen in late summer and early fall.] "We have notified healthcare providers in the community to watch and test for potential cases, and we are looking for a possible source of the bacteria. Despite this, we believe the risk to residents and visitors is very low."

Legionnaires' disease is a lung disease caused by _Legionella_ bacteria, which is commonly found in natural freshwater environments. However, it can become a health concern in water systems, such as cooling towers, plumbing systems in large buildings and certain medical devices, when conditions allow the bacteria to multiply.

People can develop Legionnaires' disease when they inhale aerosolized water droplets containing the bacteria. People cannot get Legionnaires' disease by drinking water, and it cannot be passed from person to person. Most people exposed to the bacteria do not become ill.

Legionnaires' disease is a type of pneumonia (lung infection) caused by the bacteria. People over the age of 50, smokers, or those with certain medical conditions, including weakened immune systems, chronic lung disease or other chronic health conditions, are at increased risk for Legionnaires' disease.

The health unit recommends that anyone with concerns that they may be ill to call Telehealth Ontario at 1-866-797-0000 or seek immediate medical attention if they have difficulty breathing.

More information on Legionnaires' disease can be found at <www.smdhu.org> or by calling Health Connection at 705-721-7520 or 1-877-721-7520, weekdays from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.

[The above news article reports 4 cases of Legionnaires' disease in the city of Barrie, Ontario, Canada. In October 2019, ProMED-mail posted a report of a Legionnaires' disease outbreak that involved 8 confirmed cases in individuals who reside in or visited Orillia, a nearby city about 40 km (25 miles) northeast of Barrie. (See ProMED-mail post Legionellosis - Canada (02): (ON) 20191013.6724136.) Both Barrie, with a population of 141 434 residents (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrie), and Orillia are located geographically within Simcoe County, but are politically independent, in a densely populated and industrialized region of Ontario (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simcoe_County). A map showing the location of Barrie can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Barrie,+ON,+Canada.

Humans acquire Legionnaires' disease after exposure to natural or man-made aquatic reservoirs, usually by means of inhalation of aerosolized _Legionella_ bacteria, but the disease can also be acquired by aspiration of _Legionella_-contaminated potable water in people prone to aspirate, such as debilitated hospitalized patients. _Legionella_ infection can be acquired less commonly by contamination of wounds. Possible person-to-person transmission has also been described (Correia AM, Goncalves J, Gomes, JP, et al. Probable person-to-person transmission of Legionnaires' disease. N Engl J Med 2016;374:497-8; http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356).

Water temperatures of 25-40 deg C (77-104 deg F) support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems. Aerosolization of the contaminated warm water can be generated by showerheads, spa pools and hot tubs, misting sprays in outdoor event spaces and in grocery departments, fountains, cooling towers, and car washes.

Aerosols can spread for distances outdoors, wafted in air currents downwind from their source. In fact, "Broad Street pneumonia" was described in passersby on Broad Street in front of a Philadelphia hotel, but who had never entered the hotel, where the 1976 Legionnaires' disease outbreak occurred during a Pennsylvania Legionnaires' convention (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00045731.htm).

Genotyping of clinical isolates of _Legionella_ can help identify a common source outbreak if the genotypes of clinical isolates match. Molecular typing of environmental isolates of _Legionella_ can help identify the source of the outbreak, if the environmental genotype matches the genotype of the clinical isolates. More information on the outbreak in Barrie and its possible connection to the outbreak in Orillia would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
