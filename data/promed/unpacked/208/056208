The epidemic season has hit Singapore as the number of flu cases
surged through the roof, local newspaper The Straits Times reported
Thursday [27 May 2010]. Although this has been a traditionally high
season for influenza and colds collectively called acute respiratory
infection, the number of people with the sniffles has been at
epidemic, or near-epidemic levels for the past 6 weeks. A high of 18
420 people sought treatment for the flu at government health
polyclinics last week [week of 17 may 2010], or 4000 more patients a
week than the norm for this time of the year.

Many of the flu cases involve the pandemic A (H1N1) strain, which
created a health scare worldwide last year [2009], but eventually
proved to be milder than originally thought. According to the Ministry
of Health, 29 percent of patients [in Singapore] with flu-like
symptoms last week [week of 17 May 2010] had this bug [influenza
pandemic (H1N1) virus infection].

Also worrying is the higher number of patients turning up with
pneumonia, a more severe form of upper respiratory tract infection.
Pneumonia is the 3rd biggest killer in Singapore, after cancer and
heart disease accounting for more than 2000 deaths in 2008.

[According to the WHO Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 - update 101
(<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2010_05_21/en/index.html>), in Asia the
most active areas of pandemic influenza virus transmission are in
parts of South and Southeast Asia, particularly in Bangladesh,
Malaysia, and Singapore.

In Malaysia, limited data suggests that a 2nd period of active
pandemic influenza virus transmission has been occurring since early
April 2010, but overall activity may have recently stabilized and does
not appear to exceed pandemic influenza activity seen during an
earlier period of transmission lasting from July until early September
2009.

In Singapore, levels of ARI [acute respiratory infectious] have
remained elevated since mid April 2010; during the most recent
reporting week, levels of ARI exceeded the epidemic threshold and the
proportion of patients with ILI [influenza-like illness] testing
positive for pandemic influenza virus infection was 39 percent.

In Bangladesh increased co-circulation of pandemic influenza and
seasonal influenza type B viruses has been detected since mid April
2010 but now appears to have stabilized.

Low level circulation of pandemic influenza continues to persist in
Thailand and in the western and southern parts of India; sporadic
detection of pandemic influenza continue to be reported in Cambodia
and in the Philippines.

In East Asia, only sporadic detections of pandemic influenza virus are
being reported; seasonal influenza type B viruses have been
predominant in this region, however circulation appears to be
declining in China and the Republic of Korea. - Mod.CP]
