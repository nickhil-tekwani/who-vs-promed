[It is disappointing that it takes Mozambique 6 months to report 116
cases of (presumably bubonic) plague, and it seems hardly worthwhile to
report those areas as newly infected when the outbreak is presumably
long over. On the other hand, that part of Africa is endemic for the
disease (see refs above).
We have been to Mozambique several times for WHO, we like the country
& the people, and we fully realise there are serious problems of all
kinds, but its health authorities do a disservice by delaying such
reports -- particularly when, as we have pointed out repeatedly on
this list, the International Health Regulations require a report to
WHO within 24 hours of any even *suspected* case of plague, cholera
or yellow fever - Mod.JW
