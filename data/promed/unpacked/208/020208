The Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) identified 2 imported
cases of chikungunya fever on 28 and 30 Dec 2007.
Using fever screening upon arrival at international airports, the
Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) identified 2 imported cases
with chikungunya fever on 28 and 30 Dec 2007. One of these patients
is an Indonesian worker; the other is also an Indonesian, who came to
visit his relatives. Their disease onsets were 20 and 27 Dec [2007]
respectively. After fever was identified, blood samples were taken.
Chikungunya [virus] was identified by PCR [polymerase chain
reaction]. The Taiwan CDC has included chikungunya fever as a
Category II communicable disease in order to increase awareness of
the disease and prevent outbreaks. In addition, people should be
reminded to prevent chikungunya [virus] infection when traveling to
Indonesia.

[This is yet another example of rapid movement of chikungunya virus
infected individuals into distant areas where competent vectors are
present (Taiwan reported dengue transmission in 2007). The Taiwan CDC
is to be commended for the effectiveness of their surveillance system
in detecting these incoming chikungunya cases. It is not clear if
these infected individuals were staying in areas where the
chikungunya virus vectors _Aedes aegypti_ or _Ae. albopictus_ were
present and active.
