Thailand has seen 4888 malaria cases, including 4 deaths. The western regions of the country report the highest morbidity rates per 100 000 population. Health officials say the hardest hit areas include Tak, Ubolrachathani, Maehongsorn, Ranong, and Kanchanaburi. Approximately half the cases were due to _Plasmodium vivax_, while one quarter each were attributed to _P. falciparum_ or "Unknown".

In 2012, roughly 207 million cases of malaria occurred worldwide resulting in 627 000 deaths, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). In 2013, 97 countries had ongoing malaria transmission, placing 3.4 billion people at risk for the disease.

[In 2014, Thailand reported 33 302 confirmed cases and 37 deaths. 44 percent were diagnosed as _Plasmodium falciparum_ and 47 percent as _P. vivax_. If the numbers reported here cover the entire country since 1 Jan 2015, it is a significant reduction compared to 2014.

Further information including a map of the risk of malaria in Thailand can be found in the 2014 WHO World malaria report (http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/world_malaria_report_2014/wmr-2014-profiles.pdf; pg 153). - Mod.EP
