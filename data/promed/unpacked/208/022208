[Lumpy skin disease (LSD, knopvelsiekte) is a poxvirus disease of cattle characterised by fever; nodules on the skin, mucous membranes, and internal organs; emaciation; enlarged lymph nodes; oedema of the skin; and sometimes death. The disease is of economic importance as it can cause a temporary reduction in milk production, temporary or permanent sterility in bulls, damage to hides, and death due to secondary bacterial infections.

Various strains of capripoxvirus are responsible for the disease. These are antigenically indistinguishable from strains causing sheep pox and goat pox yet distinct at the genetic level. LSD has a partially different geographical distribution from sheep and goat pox, suggesting that cattle strains of capripoxvirus do not infect and transmit between sheep and goats. Transmission of LSD virus (LSDV) is thought to be predominantly by arthropods, natural contact transmission in the absence of vectors being inefficient. Additional information on LSD is available at https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.04.12_LSD.pdf.

The huge leap of LSD from Russia's most eastern outbreak, located in the Altayskiy Kray (close to the Kazakhstan border; see 20200807.7656258), to the far eastern province Khabarovskiy Kray, exceeding 4000 km [2485 mi], is striking; see OIE's global LSD outbreak map, 1 Jan 2019 - 4 Sep 2020, at https://tinyurl.com/y7v29a4y.

Khabarovsk is located very close to the border with China's northeastern province Heilongjiang (map at https://tinyurl.com/y5n86s37). Most likely, the virus has spread from China's territory. LSD is suspected to have been widely spreading in China, while under-reported, since August 2019, when it was introduced from Kazakhstan. China's semi-annual report to the OIE, covering January - June 2020, is not yet available.
