[Antibody to Nipah virus has been found at four pig farms in Paya
Mengkuang and Bukit Berung in Alor Gajah [in the state of Malacca, an
official said here yesterday. He said an emergency meeting of the various
departments concerned, to be chaired by state secretary Datuk Wira Abdul
Aziz Omar, has been scheduled for today to discuss the actions to be taken,
including the culling of pigs.
This is the first time that the [Nipah virus has been detected in the
[Malacca state since the [beginning of the? viral encephalitis outbreak.
There are more than 150,000 pigs at the 102 farms here, with 97 farms in
Alor Gajah district alone.
[Both State Manpower and Health Committee chairman and state Agriculture
and Rural Development Committee chairman, who are jointly chairing the
committee on the pig issue, refused to comment [on the information given by
the official who said that Nipah virus infection has been detected in pigs
at four pig farms in Malacca - Mod.CYC. State Veterinary Services

[One Chinese newspaper in Malaysia also carries the story of Nipah virus
infection in pigs in Malacca. Malacca will be the fourth and latest state,
following Perak, Negri Sembilan and Johor, to report Nipah virus infection
in pigs. The earlier report of Nipah virus infection in pigs in the state
of Pahang on the east coast has not been officially confirmed. - Mod.CYC
