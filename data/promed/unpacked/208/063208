FMD spreads to Sehithwa area
---------------------------------
Department of Veterinary Services has confirmed the presence of foot
and mouth disease (FMD) at Tholamoro and Kgomotshwaana crushes in the
Sehithwa area. [In Ngamiland, North-West Botswana, map at

The areas are further south of the earlier discovery in the Habu
Extension, where the disease was confirmed in mid October last year
[2007]. It was followed by the banning of movement of all
cloven-hoofed livestock and wildlife into or out of Zone 2. Also
banned was movement of fresh products from cloven-hoofed animals such
as milk, meat, skins and trophies. Furthermore, inspections and
surveillance were mounted to confine the disease within the affected area.

Dr. Musa Fanikiso, Director of Veterinary Services, said it is highly
probable that animals confirmed to have FMD at Sehitwa were strays
that got infected around Habu area and later returned to their kraals
at Sehithwa. He said confinement of FMD to a single focus is greatly
facilitated by physical barrier such as a cordon fence.

However, such a barrier does not exist between Habu and Sehithwa
areas. Cattle move regularly between the 2 areas, much more so during
periods of drought when these animals move northwards towards the
delta for better pasture and water.

Dr. Fanikiso said the latest discovery at Sehithwa would not change
the original strategy of controlling the outbreak through vaccination
and movement control as this still remains the most appropriate, and
preferred strategy. He said his department has intensified
surveillance and movement control within the area.

The farming community has been urged to assist by herding their
animals to avoid contact with infected animals. Some 130 342 cattle
of the 134 092 cattle which were eligible for vaccination have been
vaccinated. He said follow up vaccinations will be done in selected
and vulnerable crushes.

Dr. Fanakiso said vaccination coverage was unsatisfactory in some
areas, particularly the lake Ngami area where it was not easy to
round up cattle. He said the main challenge facing his department was
ensuring that the infected cattle did not mix with non-infected
animals, much more so that there was no cordon fence to separate the
infected areas from non-infected areas.

Other challenges, farmer apathy and the presence of water everywhere
due to recent heavy rains, which made rounding up of cattle
difficult. In spite of all these challenges, a tremendous effort has
been put into ensuring that as many animals as possible are inspected
and vaccinated to curb spread of the disease.

Dr. Fanikiso further said construction of the fence separating 2c and
2d has commenced, adding that about 99 km [61.5 miles] of the
original line from Seokgwe to Reronde has been cleared of bushes.

He appealed for public support to confine the disease in the Habu
area through movement control and prompt reporting of all suspect
cases. He explained that it was critical that the majority of cattle
were vaccinated in order to eliminate the disease.

Dr. Fanikiso also confirmed that animals that have been vaccinated
against FMD could be re-infected and show signs of the disease adding
that there were many reasons why this might happen and often this
would require investigations to determine factors that have lead to
an outbreak.

The FMD vaccine they are using is produced by the Botswana Vaccine
Institute and has been successfully used to control the FMD in
Botswana and other regions in Africa for years. Dr. Fanakiso said the
department was investigating the cause of the current outbreaks.

[Acccording to the data of the World Reference Laboratory for FMD
(Pirbright), the serotypes reported from Botswana (in brackets, last
year reported) are : SAT1 (2006), SAT2 (2006), SAT3 (1966). See further at
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/africa/bot.htm>.

On 13 Dec 2007, Botswana reported to the OIE (in a 4th follow-up
report, all pertaining to Ngamiland) the identification of serotype
SAT 2, rather than SAT 1 as in previous reports:
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/africa/bot.htm>. A new
follow-up report is expected. - Mod.AS]
