There is serious risk that lumpy skin disease (LSD) in cattle is spreading from the affected location in Northern Cyprus. The European Community authorities are taking very strict measures regarding this disease, which has never entered the EU.

EU experts who arrived here last weekend visited the infected farms in [Northern Cyprus] on Wednesday [10 Dec 2014]. Yesterday [Thu 11 Dec 2014], they held a meeting with the Veterinary Services [Nicosia, Republic of Cyprus] and reported about their observations. It became apparent that if the disease enters the territory controlled by the Republic of Cyprus, severe control measures, such as the killing of positive animals and vaccinations, will be required, and Cyprus will enter a 3-year period of export prohibitions of meat and cow's milk.

It was also said that in such a scenario, EU's Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health in Brussels is likely to impose restrictions upon the exports of Halloumi from Cyprus to the member states, unless it is made from 100 percent goat's milk. [Halloumi is a Cypriot semi-hard, unripened brined cheese, traditionally made from a mixture of goat's and sheep's milk but in recent years sometimes also including cow's milk. Halloumi is Cyprus's 2nd biggest export to overseas markets. In 2013, exports were worth Euro 76.4 million [USD 102 million], up 26 percent on the prior year. - Mod.AS].

Although all indications show that the disease was transferred to [Northern Cyprus] from Turkey, so far this has not been confirmed, the mode of transmission remaining unknown. Experts say it might have originated either from contaminated imported hay or was airborne by mosquitoes.

At yesterday's [11 Dec 2014] meeting with the visiting experts, it was reported that LSD cases have been identified on 8 different holdings, all in the Karpas peninsula [see comment]. The experts suggested that vaccination should be applied.

[On 12 Dec 2012], cattle breeders were invited to the Veterinary Services where the need for spraying insecticides [or repellents? - Mod.AS] in local cattle plants was explained. The Health services, on their side, take care of spraying along the Green Line [the line dividing the Island of Cyprus between the Greek and Turkish entities - Mod.AS].

According to the press release from the Directorate of Press and Public Relations Office of the Near East University, Prof. Dr. Omer Memduh Esendal, Dean of NEU Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, stated that LSD virus had affected the animals in TRNC [Northern Cyprus; the self-declared "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus"], recently adding that there was no scientific evidence that LSD virus affects humans.

"Lumpy skin disease, known as exanthema nodularis bovis, is a contagious viral disease of cattle that is characterized by rough skin nodules in hazelnut or walnut size. LSD is a notifiable disease. In case of LSD suspicion, state authorities should be notified immediately. Animals suspected with LSD should be isolated, and the farm should be quarantined until definitive diagnosis is determined," noted Esendal.

Stating that lumpy skin disease was caused by a virus in the family Poxviridae, genus Capripoxvirus, Professor Esendal noted: "This genus is closely related antigenically to sheep and goat pox viruses. LSD is usually seen in cattle in a wide range of ecotypes in Africa, where, in the last 20 years, it appears to have spread to virtually all countries on the continent.

Highlighting that the morbidity rate in cattle is 40 percent and mortality is low in most cases, varying from 1 to 10 percent, Professor Esendal said: "The disease may rarely cause abortion in pregnant [animals]. Dependent on the stage of the disease, reduction in milk production, fatigue, emaciation, loss of fertility and lameness can be seen."

"LSD is a contagious disease transmitted from animal to animal primarily by biting insects, particularly mosquitoes. As virus can be present in cutaneous lesions, saliva, nasal discharge, milk, and semen, direct contact is also a source of infections. There is no scientific evidence that LSD virus can be transmitted from animals to humans," said Esendal.

Touching upon the importance of taking measures for combating the disease, Professor Esendal noted: "As lumpy skin disease spreads by biting flies and mosquitoes, which feed on the skin lesions, it is very important to fight against the biting insect vectors to prevent LSD. To this end, all known preventive measures including strict biosecurity and hygiene applications on livestock premises should be taken necessarily in a timely manner. Good biosecurity is a vital part of keeping disease away from animals. It also helps to improve farm efficiency, protect neighboring farms and the countryside. If lumpy skin disease is confirmed, animals suspected with LSD should be isolated, and the farm should be quarantined. Cleaning and disinfection of premises, insect control, depopulation of the infected animals and proper disposal of carcasses are of utmost importance."

When high fever, nodules on the skin, emaciation, enlarged lymph nodes, edema of the skin are seen, LSD can be suspected. However, definitive diagnosis is possible by detection of the virus by proper tests in laboratory conditions. Before collecting or sending any samples for diagnostic test, the respective authorities should be contacted. Material for virus isolation and antigen detection should be collected by biopsy or at post-mortem from skin nodules, lung lesions or lymph nodes. Samples for virus isolation and antigen-detection should be collected within the 1st week of the occurrence of clinical signs. Samples should only be sent under secure conditions and to authorized laboratories to prevent the spread of the disease.

There is no specific treatment for the disease.

Animals infected with LSD virus generally recover in time. Complete recovery may take several months. Within this process, antibiotics can be administrated to prevent or control secondary infections.

Indicating that vaccination against LSD has been successfully practiced in many countries in Africa, Professor Esendal noted: "There is no specific vaccination program against LSD in TRNC or Turkey [re. Turkey, see comment]. However, as LSD virus belongs to the same family as sheep and goat pox virus, sheep and goat pox vaccines can be used for the prevention of LSD."

[The Karpas Peninsula, where all described LSD cases in Cyprus are located, a long, finger-like peninsula in northeast Cyprus, is one of the most prominent geographical features of the island. It is about 70 km from continental Turkey. Its farthest extent, Cape Apostolos Andreas, is about 100 km from the Syrian coast to the east.

Turkey, reportedly infected by LSD virus since summer 2013, applies "Vaccination in response to the outbreak." On 22 Jul 2014, Turkey submitted its final OIE report, stating: "The event is unlikely to be contained and is now considered to be endemic. No more follow-up reports will be made, but instead, information about this disease will be included in the future 6-monthly reports." For the report, with vaccination figures per province (totaling more than 730 000 cattle) and an interactive map (with recent outbreaks in Turkey; the map can be centered on Cyprus and zoomed in), see http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=15669.

The situation in Syria is assumed to be considerably worse, but no information is officially available.

In case the disease is still limited to the Karpas Peninsula, earliest eradication deserves to be considered. "Killing of positive animals and vaccinations" may not be sufficient for this end and for the prevention of LSD spread southwards into the Republic of Cyprus (meaning LSD within the EU).

When LSD entered Israel for the 1st time in September 1989, the outbreak was controlled by stamping out. The entire cattle population in the affected village was culled, combined with vaccination of all cattle around the Gaza strip and around the infected village. It was decided to refrain from introducing an exotic vaccine strain, preferring a sheep pox vaccine strain which had been certified and applied for decades for the protection of sheep against sheep pox in Israel. The vaccine was tested for its safety and efficacy in cattle according to OIE's guidelines as outlined in the Terrestrial Manual; the trials, involving 6 susceptible 5-month old Friesian calves (4 vaccinated, challenged 21 days post vaccination and 2 controls) were performed in a containment facility at the Kimron Veterinary Institute, Beit-Dagan (Ref 1). Israel remained thereafter free from LSD for 17 years, in spite of the disease being endemic in Egypt and of infected animals discovered in the adjacent Gaza strip in 1992. Vaccinations were discontinued since 1993.

In 2006, the disease returned to Israel. Modified stamping out (killing of clinical cases) was applied. The disease continued in 2007. Since July 2012, the disease spread throughout large parts of Israel, requiring mass vaccinations, and may currently be regarded as endemic.

ProMED-mail's posting "Lumpy skin disease, bovine - Cyprus: (Northern Cyprus) RFI" (archived 20141205.3012426) included the following commentary on a field-comparative vaccination trial against LSD, performed during 2013 in Israel, addressing 2 vaccines:

1. Live attenuated RM 65 sheep pox strain (fortified) "POX-10;"
2. Live attenuated LSD vaccine "Neethling" strain.

The following text was included: "As apparent from the results, presented during Israel's 26th annual dairy science conference (Ashkelon, 29-30 Oct 2014), the Neethling vaccine conferred better protection from day 15 post-vaccination and onwards. Additional details are expected to be included in the paper when published."

In response, we received from a subscriber who preferred to remain unnamed, a response with reservations, including the following remarks: "There were many reported adverse reactions and mild disease outbreaks following the Neethling vaccine injections while hardly if any reactions following the "POX-10" usage."

Though "additional details" are expected to be included in the paper covering the said field comparative vaccination trial against LSD when published (in a scientific journal), we have asked the authors of the cited preliminary report to briefly address, at this time, the raised issue of post-vaccination reactions. The following complementary information has been kindly provided by the chief veterinarian of "Hachaklait:"

"Both "Pox-10" and "Neethling" strain vaccines had passed a limited field trial to assess the clinical safety of the 2 commercial vaccines in Israeli dairy cattle. Local reactions and systemic deviations from normal body temperature, milk production and impact upon pregnancy (abortion) were addressed. No serious or life threatening adverse events were observed in the course of this part of the trial. Based on the data generated from this study, there are no indications to doubt the clinical safety of both tested vaccines to be administered in 4-6 month-old female dairy calves as well as in adult dairy cattle during the last trimester of their pregnancy.

In the 2013 LSD outbreak, almost half of the cattle at risk had already been vaccinated with a single sheep pox strain vaccine when they were revaccinated with the Neethling strain (the reason for this revaccination was the observed deficient protection rendered by the initial vaccination with a single sheep pox RM65 dose).

Out of about 250 000 vaccinated animals, no case of death has been reported, and very small numbers (data analysis in process) of animals had shown on day 10-11 minor skin lesions, mostly without milk drop (this, in accordance with the Neethling vaccine's producer's information on 'Effects of the Vaccine')."

In reference to the comparative vaccination trial undertaken in 2013 on 15 dairy cattle operations (ProMED-mail 20141205.3012426), kindly note that all participating animals had been vaccinated with a single dose sheep-pox strain RM65 vaccine prior to the start of the trial. The number of animals with significant LSD signs was lower in the Neethling group from day-post-vaccination (DPV) 15 and onwards.

The complete data and their analysis are in process for publication in a scientific journal."

We are grateful to Dr Benny Sharir, Chief Veterinarian, "Hachaklait" and to his colleagues engaged in the trials, for kindly providing the above timely clarifications. The publication of the complete paper is anticipated with interest.

Since the issue of LSD vaccinations is increasingly becoming acute, currently in Cyprus but, unfortunately, possibly soon in additional Asian and European countries, with naive cattle threatened by LSD, controlled vaccination trials in susceptible animals seem urgently needed in order to select the safest and most efficacious vaccines.
