There are currently [almost] one million people infected with cholera in wartorn Yemen, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced on [Wed 13 Dec 2017]. Some 2225 people have died on the disease since [Thu 27 Apr 2017], it added.

The UN organization issued a report stating that as of [Mon 11 Dec 2017], there were 983 486 cases of Cholera in Yemen. The organization also noted that during the same period, it recorded 2225 deaths caused by the disease, spread across 21 of the country's 22 provinces. The report noted that the island of Socotra is the only area that has not witnessed a cholera outbreak.

The strategic Red Sea port city of Hudaydah, which is under Houthi contro, has the highest number of cases with over 143 000. The Hajjah province has had the highest number of cholera deaths with 417. Up to 32 percent of cholera deaths in Yemen are children

Cholera is a disease that causes acute diarrhea that could lead to the death of those affected within hours if not treated. Malnourished children aged 5 and under are most prone to the disease.

Impoverished Yemen has remained in a state of civil war since 2014, when Houthi rebels overran much of the country, including the capital Sana'a. In 2015, Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies launched a massive air campaign aimed at reversing Houthi military gains and shoring up Yemen's embattled government. According to UN officials, more than 10 000 people have been killed in the war, while more than 11 per cent of the country's population has been displaced.

It is sometimes difficult to assess until to what point in time the numbers were collected. Over the past 2 weeks, it appears that there were 20 950 newly reported cases, averaging about 1496 cases PER DAY. The daily that rate, it would take about 14 days to reach one million cases, although the newly reported cases are decreasing. The low case fatality rate might suggest that some of the diarrhea may be non-cholera. There are now as many cases in over 7 months than in the entire 7 years of the Haitian cholera disaster.
