The number of deaths because of a salmonella outbreak detected in 5 clinics
and residences for the elderly in southern Germany has increased to 7, and
the number of infected people is now 32, announced the sanitary authorities
at Oberallgau in Bavaria.
Irmgard Harms, head of the Health Office for the region, indicated in a
press conference held in Sonthofen (one of the affected cities), that the
disease is currently in its acute phase in 6 of the infected patients.
Gebhard Kaiser, sanitary officer in charge for the region, confirmed that
the number of infected persons is 32, and he pointed out that clinical
tests had been performed on 77 persons.
Among people with positive results in the aforementioned tests are 12
clinic workers from Oberstdorf, Immenstadt, and Sonthofen; 10 are patients
attending these health facilities; and the remaining 10 currently live in 2
residences for the elderly.
At this moment, the authorities do not know the origin or the mode of
transmission for these infections. The 3 clinics and the 2 residences
receive food supplies from an Immenstadt-based company.

[The species of the organism or organisms is not given. Given a single
food supplier, the outbreak is likely to have stemmed from there. There is
no breakdown of fatalities, but it is likely that the deaths occurred among
the elderly and/or infirm. - Mod.LL]
