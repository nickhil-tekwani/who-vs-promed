Transmission of malaria in resort areas, Dominican Republic, 2004
-----------------------------------------------
Malaria is caused by any of 4 Plasmodium parasites carried by Anopheles
mosquitoes and usually is transmitted by the bite of an infective female
Anopheles. In rural areas of the Dominican Republic, _P. falciparum_
malaria is endemic, with the highest risk in the far western region of the
country, and prophylactic medication with chloroquine is recommended for
incoming travelers. Conversely, urban and resort areas in the Dominican
Republic have been considered nonmalarious, and prophylactic medication has
not been recommended for persons traveling to these areas (1). However,
since November 2004, CDC has received reports of 3 malaria cases in U.S.
travelers returning from areas in La Altagracia and Duarte provinces
previously considered nonmalarious. An additional 14 cases of malaria in La
Altagracia Province, in the far eastern region of the country, have been
reported in European and Canadian travelers. This report summarizes the
overall investigation, which led to expansion of CDC recommendations for
chloroquine prophylaxis to include all of La Altagracia and Duarte provinces.
Epidemiologic Investigation
----------
After receiving reports of malaria in 2 U.S. travelers to the Dominican
Republic, CDC contacted the Pan American Health Organization, World Health
Organization, and Ministry of Health (MoH) in the Dominican Republic, which
initiated investigations. 17 patients (3 from the United States, 6 from
Canada, and 8 from European countries) were identified; _P. falciparum_
malaria was confirmed in all of them. 16 of the patients had traveled to
Punta Cana resorts in La Altagracia Province and one to San Francisco de
Macoris in Duarte Province. 16 returned home during 3-16 Nov 2004, and one
returned 20 Dec 2004; all were admitted to hospitals, and 6 required
treatment in ICUs. As of 30 Dec 2004, no deaths had been reported; 3
patients remained hospitalized. 7 of the patients confirmed that they had
not traveled to any other malarious areas nor received any blood
transfusions during the preceding year.
Prevention and Control Measures
----------
On 24 Nov 2004, CDC expanded its recommendations for chloroquine
prophylaxis for travelers to the Dominican Republic to include all of La
Altagracia and Duarte provinces, in addition to rural areas countrywide
(2). The revised recommendations advise clinicians and travelers about the
expanded malaria risk area, so that any febrile persons who have visited
these areas will receive prompt diagnosis and treatment to avoid severe
complications. Major networks of blood collection agencies and the Food and
Drug Administration also were contacted. Similar alerts were issued by
health officials in Europe and by the Public Health Agency of Canada.
The MoH investigation included active case detection and entomologic
investigations in La Altagracia and Duarte provinces. In Duarte Province,
officials confirmed that no other cases had been reported during 2003-2004.
Nonetheless, MoH is taking precautionary measures, including enhanced
surveillance. In La Altagracia Province, MoH surveillance data have
identified an increase in cases of malaria beginning in November 2004 among
migrant workers in the Bavaro Zone, 10 miles from the Punta Cana resort
area. MoH intensified control measures in the Bavaro Zone, which include 1)
presumptive treatment of all construction and hotel workers by using
directly observed therapy with chloroquine and primaquine, and 2) mosquito
control through residual and spatial insecticide spraying and application
of larvicide to suspected breeding sites. Measures instituted in the Punta
Cana resort area include intensified surveillance and larvicide application.

MMWR Editorial Note:
This report describes an outbreak of malaria in areas in the Dominican
Republic previously thought to be nonmalarious. P. falciparum is the only
malaria parasite in the Dominican Republic and has remained susceptible to
chloroquine. Because P. falciparum malaria can be rapidly fatal, travelers
should be aware of risk areas so that they can take appropriate preventive
measures; clinicians should consider malaria in their diagnosis and
treatment of febrile illness in travelers. Malaria can be prevented by
taking an antimalarial drug and by preventing mosquito bites. Chloroquine
is the recommended drug for malaria prevention for persons traveling to the
Dominican Republic and is highly efficacious and well tolerated by most
travelers. To prevent mosquito bites, travelers should use insect repellent
containing up to 50 percent DEET and wear long-sleeved clothing; if not
staying in screened or air-conditioned housing, they should sleep under a
net, preferably one treated with insecticide. Rapid intervention is crucial
for ill travelers with suspected malaria (3). In nearly all cases in this
outbreak, delays in diagnosis and treatment occurred; in certain cases,
delays contributed to serious illness.
During July 1999--March 2000, a previous outbreak in the Dominican Republic
occurred among European travelers to Punta Cana, principally in the Bavaro
Zone. Factors identified as contributing to that outbreak were 1) the
increased breeding of A. albimanus mosquitoes, the predominant malaria
vector in the Dominican Republic, in the wake of Hurricanes Mitch and
George and 2) malaria-infected migrant workers. In 1999, approximately 3000
malaria cases were reported in the Dominican Republic, a 50 percent
increase over the number of cases in 1998 (4). During the 1999--2000
outbreak, CDC travel recommendations were temporarily expanded to recommend
chloroquine prophylaxis for all areas in La Altagracia Province; this
recommendation was rescinded 2 months later after MoH increased
surveillance and controlled the outbreak.
In September 2004, Hurricane Jeanne struck the Dominican Republic. The east
coast, including Punta Cana and the Bavaro Zone, received heavy rains and
flooding, which might have resulted in increased breeding of mosquitoes. In
addition, construction in Punta Cana and the Bavaro Zone has brought in
many migrant workers from areas where malaria is endemic. The ongoing MoH
investigation will attempt to determine whether these factors have
contributed to the recent increased transmission. MoH surveillance data
indicate that, on average, approximately 1500--2500 malaria cases are
reported annually in the Dominican Republic; in 2004, a total of 2012 cases
had been reported through November.
Effective surveillance systems and rapid communication among surveillance
networks are crucial to detecting cases of malaria and intervening in areas
that are usually nonmalarious. During this outbreak, rapid communication
among surveillance networks in North America, Europe, and the Caribbean led
to prompt diagnoses and timely public health interventions to prevent
additional cases among residents of and travelers to the Dominican Republic.

[This posting is a shorter version of the full text from the MMWR article.
No new cases have been reported the last 4 weeks, and it is conceivable
that the risk to travelers has decreased, although the recommendation for
chloroquine prophylaxis is still maintained. The question whether the cases
come from the 2 provinces where tourists concentrate, and what the risk is
in the rest of the island, remain unanswered. Numbers of malaria cases in
the local population would be important. - Mod.EP]
