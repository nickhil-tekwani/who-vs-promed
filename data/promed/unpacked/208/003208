Movements of fish into, out of, and within a fishery in Beccles, Suffolk, have been restricted, following the confirmation of Koi herpesvirus.

Cefas [Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science] acting on behalf of Defra [Department of Food Environment & Rural Affairs] has issued a confirmed designation prohibiting the movement of fish to, from and within Henstead Fishing Lakes, Henstead, Beccles, Suffolk and applying the following additional control measures.

Under the requirements of the designation the fishery has also been directed to establish and maintain on-site facilities for the disinfection of angling equipment prior to being taken out of the designation area and anglers must comply with their use.

A sample was taken from the affected site following reported deaths of fish showing clinical signs associated with this disease. The sample tested positive for the presence of Koi herpesvirus.

[Koi herpesvirus disease (KHD) in common carp (_Cyprinus carpio_) disease has been reported throughout the world. The disease is transmitted by fish to fish contact and it is also possible that the disease can spread through contaminated water, nets and other equipment. As other herpesviruses, KHD has the capacity to remain latent in infected fish and become activated and cause disease when some stressors trigger it. More information on KHD is found in OIE Aquatic Manual chapter (2009 update), which is available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/aahm/2010/2.3.06_KHVD.pdf.
