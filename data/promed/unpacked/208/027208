Uganda reporting up to 10 000 malaria cases a week in the north
---------------------------------------------------------------
In a follow-up to the malaria outbreak in northern Uganda, which has been ongoing for some 2 months and health officials say things only seem to be getting worse.

Local media report that the 10 districts in the north facing the surge of malaria are now seeing between 8000 to 10 000 cases per week, up from 3000 per week just recently.

The total number of malaria cases reported since the beginning of the outbreak was not disclosed; however, in mid-July [2015] we reported there were 23 000 cases. This number must be much higher today based on what we are hearing.

The affected districts include Lamwo, Gulu, Kitgum, Oyam, Agago, Apac, Amuru, Kole, Nwoya and Pader.

Dr Myers Lugemwa, the deputy programme manager, Malaria Control Programme at the Ministry of Health suggests that the surge of new infections may be linked to evolved, resistant mosquitoes.

[The WHO World Malaria Report (http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/world_malaria_report_2014/wmr-2014-profiles.pdf?ua=1) provides detailed information on malaria in Uganda. 90 percent of the population lives in high transmission areas with greater than 75 cases per 1000 population per year and over 80 percent of cases are _Plasmodium falciparum_. Malaria control rests on distribution free of charge of insecticide treated nets to all age groups, indoor residual spraying and intermittent treatment to pregnant women. Artemisinin Combination Therapy, ACT, should be available throughout the country. The majority of the funding for the malaria control program comes from the Global Fund and USAID.

There can be several explanations for a sudden surge in the number of cases. The 1st explanation could be failure of ACT and it is important to look into the quality of the drug. Resistance is less likely as it would be more insidious and resistance to ACT has not been reported in tropical Africa yet. Changes in residual spraying programs could also be an explanation. - Mod.EP
