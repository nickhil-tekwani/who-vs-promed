2000/131 First report of plum pox potyvirus in Canada [edited
---------------------------------------------------------------
Following the introduction of plum pox potyvirus (PPV - EPPO A2 quarantine
pest) into Pennsylvania, US (see EPPO RS 99/169), the Canadian Food
Inspection Agency conducted surveys [in Canada for this virus in fruit
tree orchards. In June 2000, PPV (D strain, the same as that detected in
Pennsylvania) was detected for the first time on 3 nectarine trees at 2
sites in an orchard near Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario. [Results of
continuing surveillance in the Niagara Peninsula [show that as of 8 Sep
2000, 681 of 41 346 samples tested were infected. [Infected samples came
from 30 different locations: 27 in the Niagara Peninsula (near
Niagara-on-the-Lake, St Catharines, Lincoln), one near Simcoe and 2 near
Blenheim (southwestern Ontario). [The earlier suggestion that PPV was
introduced from Pennsylvania was considered unlikely because the Blenheim
trees did not originate from Pennsylvania. To determine the extent of the
disease, other areas in Ontario and other regions of Canada will be surveyed.
The status of plum pox potyvirus in Canada can be described as:
Present: only in some areas (Ontario), under eradication.
