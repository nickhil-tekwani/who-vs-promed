Poultry from a market in Lhasa, the capital of southwest China's
Tibet Autonomous Region, were found infected with the bird flu virus,
China's ministry of agriculture reported on [Tue 6 Mar 2007].
According to the ministry's information office, the birds died on 1
Mar 2007, and tests for the H5 virus performed by the National Avian
Influenza Reference Laboratory were positive.
Specialists and officials are taking measures to control the virus
and prevent further infection in the area, presumably spread by birds
migrating from east Africa to west Asia.
The measures include closure of market, a cull of poultry in the
market, disinfecting the area, inspections of poultry markets, and
monitoring of wild birds to prevent the spread of avian influenza.
Earlier this month [March 2007], 3 wild birds and 2 poultry birds
tested positive for the H5 virus out of 325 poultry and 20 wild birds
tested in Fujian province (China), where a woman who contracted the
disease [February 2007], is in a critical condition, according to
authorities.

The local daily Arab Times reported Friday [9 Mar 2007], that Kuwait
has detected a new case of the H5N1 strain of bird flu, raising the
total number of the cases to 53 in the Gulf state since late February
[2007].
Dr. Rashed Owaish, spokesman for the Kuwaiti Health Ministry, was
quoted as saying that the virus was found Thursday [8 Mar 2007] in a
chicken in the Wafra area, 120 km. (75 miles) south of Kuwait City.
"Wafra has reported the maximum number of bird flu cases and our
teams are working in overdrive in that area to prevent the spread of
the disease," said the spokesman.
The spokesman confirmed most of the cases were detected in backyard
poultry and not in poultry farms, noting that no human cases of bird
flu have been discovered since the outbreak late last month [February
2007]. "The situation is under control as the number of cases is
decreasing by the day and we are hopeful we will be able to eradicate
the disease soon," said the spokesman.
Owaish said a team of experts from the International Animal Health
Organization (OIE) has held talks with officials from the Kuwaiti
Health Ministry on ways to prevent the spread of the disease. "The
team will submit a detailed report to the Health Ministry pertaining
to the bird flu situation in the country on Friday" he added.

Afghanistan will cull poultry after 13 new cases of the deadly H5N1
strain of bird flu were discovered, including some in the capital, a
United Nations official said.
Assadullah Azhari, the United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organisation (UN FAO) spokesperson in Afghanistan, said the latest
outbreak comprised 6 cases of home-raised poultry in the eastern
province of Nangarhar, 4 in Kabul, and 3 in eastern Kunar province.
"We collected samples from these areas and all tested positive,"
Azhari said. He added the government had not said how many birds
would be culled. Quarantine and vaccination measures were also being
used.
The World Animal Health Organisation (OIE) had already confirmed 2
outbreaks of H5N1 each in flocks of backyard poultry in Nangarhar and
in turkeys in Kunar. The total number of cases discovered [so far]
this year [2007], is 17.
Last month [February 2007], Afghanistan banned poultry imports to
prevent the spread of the virus.
Last year [2006], the H5N1 strain was found in poultry in at least 4
Afghan provinces, leading to the killing of thousands of birds, but
there were no human deaths.
Afghanistan imports a large amount of poultry, mostly from Pakistan.
The ban imposed also applies to other countries affected by H5N1,
including Britain, Turkey and Indonesia.
The country [is located] at the junction of central and south Asia
and is on the migration route for several species of wild birds.

[The outbreak in Tibet has been mentioned before but it appears as if
definitive information and critical details still have not been
submitted to OIE or formally disseminated in some other fashion.
While most of the cases have been in backyard poultry, flocks of a
couple thousand birds have been affected, as well as falcons in the
Kuwait Zoo. While the article indicates the number of cases is
waning, there is an ebb and flow to the spread, so far, in the
country and continued efforts to practice strict biosecurity and
intensive surveillance are still required.
