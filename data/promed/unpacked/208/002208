A total of 2 Burger King restaurants in Bemidji, MN, temporarily closed [Thu 30 Nov 2017], after more than 2 dozen people contracted salmonellosis after eating there. Doug Schultz, a spokesperson with the Minnesota Department of Health, said the department has confirmed 27 cases, and received reports of 4 more probable cases.

Most cases were identified in September [2017], he said, but the victims may have been exposed before then. Two additional cases came to light this week [week of Sun 26 Nov 2017], prompting the closures. "They may have been sick a couple weeks or so before then," Schultz said. "It takes a while before people get symptoms, and then they're sick enough to go to the doctor, and then we identify."

Symptoms of salmonellosis, a bacterial disease that infects the intestinal tract, can include nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, fever, chills, headache and blood in the stool, according to the Mayo Clinic.

Once the Department of Health identified the outbreak in September 2017, they put "stringent" interventions in place, Schultz said. The Burger Kings were both cleaned and any employees with symptoms were kept from working until they were symptom-free for 72 hours, but the precautions did not stop the outbreak. "Most of the time that does the trick, 98 percent of the time we don't see further transmission," Schultz said. "In this case we had 2 additional illnesses pop up this week."

Schultz said the MDH believes the outbreak is due to employee illness, rather than a specific contaminated food item. Before the restaurants can reopen each employee must be tested for salmonella twice. The earliest the Burger Kings could reopen is next week [week of Sun 2 Dec 2017], according to Schultz. The restaurants must also be thoroughly re-cleaned. "We do clearly have evidence of food worker illness being part of the problem," Schultz said.

[The serotype of the _Salmonella enterica_ cases is not stated. If the new cases are the same as the older ones, it is possible that the hiatus of cases might reflect, if this indeed is food handler-related, transmission from a 2nd food handler. ProMED awaits more information regarding this outbreak. - Mod.LL
