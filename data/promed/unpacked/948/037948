The French authorities last week asked Brussels to outlaw imports of
horse meat from eastern Europe after more than 400 people were struck
down with potentially life-threatening food poisoning. One man fell
into a coma for several days and had problems recovering his speech.
The scare is likely to hit the declining horse-meat trade in France,
already under threat from changing consumer tastes. Although the meat
still enjoys a reputation among older French people as a healthy
food, eating horse has become unfashionable and consumption has
dropped hugely in the past two decades. Sales plummeted in 1994 when
the former film star Brigitte Bardot made an appeal on prime-time
television for the French to boycott horse meat. A spokesman for the
French Federation of Hippophagic Butchers said: "We're at the mercy
of such outbreaks because each case leads to another drop in
business." One Parisian horse butcher said: "Trade's going down all
the time. Cases of contaminated horse meat don't do us any favours,
and people are increasingly concerned about where our horse meat
comes from."
It is the second major incident of trichinellosis in the south of
France this year. An earlier case in February in Montauban left some
130 people sick. In a previous trichinellosis outbreak in 1985, five
people died. The parasite is found in the raw or undercooked flesh of
pigs and horse. The worm is endemic in eastern European countries and
North America, and has been at the root of some 2000 cases of food
poisoning in Europe in recent years.
The source of the latest outbreak in the south of France was traced
to an infected carcass from Serbia. The presence of the parasite in
the flesh is thought to have come from the horse being fed animal
protein, probably pork carcasses. Professor Jean Dupouy-Calmet, a
French specialist on trichinellosis, says that horses used for
agricultural work in eastern Europe are often sold to abattoirs when
they reach around 10 years old, and are first fattened up to obtain
the highest price. He said: "For several weeks, the animal is fed a
diet enriched with animal protein. In eastern European countries,
Trichinella is widespread in pigs. It's not unlikely that
contaminated pork meat was fed to the horse."
Horses from eastern Europe are transported live to France, while
those from North America come frozen. The carcasses are checked by
the French authorities before sale. But the latest outbreak has
raised fears that the inspection methods are inadequate. Analyses
carried out once people began to fall ill revealed that the horse in
question was heavily infested. Now the victims have formed an
association and are preparing to sue those responsible.

[Freezing does provide a measure of protection, except with arctic
strains of Trichinella. On the other hand American horses, whether
excess Mustangs on range or culled riding and work horses, go straight
from grazing to the slaughter house. It will be interesting to see
what impact this current problem has on the French demand for North
American horsemeat - Mod.MHJ
[Trichinellosis is henceforth banished from our list, as it is not an
emerging disease, just a signal of the failure of meat inspection
procedures. Now if a porcine TSE were to get into humans via horse
meat, that would be a different matter - Mod.JW
