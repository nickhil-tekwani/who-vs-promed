British Columbia (BC) fisheries officials met this weekend with several US
governments to discuss a new threat to the west coast fishery. A pesky
crab, the *mitten crab* (_Eriocheir sinensis_), a species from China, is
causing a major dilemma for governments on both sides of the border
The unwelcome, hairy-clawed crab could soon arrive in Canadian waters.
Mitten crabs have invaded the shores of California. Millions of them have
clogged pipes, and stolen food and habitat from other fish.
California now outlaws the possession of live mitten crabs. Dede Alpert, a
senator from San Diego, suggests Canadians be vigilant about the mitten
crab. "If there's even one crab spotted, immediately take action," she warns.
Alpert said fisheries officials in California weren't initially aware of
how quickly the mitten crabs could spread and cause trouble. "By the time
we really got on this ... actually put some resources towards it, we just
had literally millions on our hands. Alpert recommends killing any crabs
that might make their way north
BC Fisheries Minister Dennis Streifel says politicians from north and south
are moving beyond the Pacific Salmon Treaty, signed earlier this summer.
The province attacked the federal treaty while several American governors
stood behind it.
Streifel said he's now talking to state legislators and senators about
common concerns such as the mitten crab.

[These crabs present an economic problem to the fishing and shrimping
industries as well as to species of other animals and the crabs rapidly
multiply. There is some threat to human health. The following was extracted
from the web site:
<http://www2.delta.dfg.ca.gov/mittencrab/life_hist.html>. The Chinese
mitten crab (_Eriocheir sinensis_), so named for the dense patches of hairs
on the claws of larger juveniles and adults, is native to the coastal
rivers and estuaries of the Yellow Sea. In San Francisco Estuary, the
mitten crab was first collected in 1992 by commercial shrimp trawlers in
South San Francisco Bay and has spread rapidly throughout the estuary.
In Asia, the mitten crab is a delicacy and crabs have been imported live to
markets in Los Angeles and San Francisco.
The mitten crab is catadromous - adults reproduce in salt water and the
offspring migrate to fresh water to rear. In the San Francisco Estuary, the
mitten crab matures in 2 to 3 years, although it matures from 1 to 5 years
elsewhere, depending on water temperature. Mating and fertilization occurs
in late fall and winter, generally at salinities >20*. A single female can
carry 250,000 to 1 million eggs.
Mitten crabs are adept walkers on land, and, in their upstream migration,
they readily move across banks or levees to bypass obstructions, such as
dams or weirs. In Germany, large numbers of mitten crabs were reported to
leave the water at night when they encountered an obstruction and
occasionally wandered the streets and entered houses. In Stockton, 2 adult
mitten crabs climbed over a levee and into a swimming pool when they
encountered a small dam blocking their downstream migration.
Mitten crabs are omnivores, with juveniles eating mostly vegetation, but
preying upon animals, especially small invertebrates, as they grow.
Based on the impacts of mitten crabs in their native range and Europe, they
pose several possible threats. The mitten crab is the secondary
intermediate host for the Oriental lung fluke, with mammals, including
humans, as the final host. Humans become infested by eating raw or poorly
cooked mitten crabs. However, neither the lung fluke nor any of the
freshwater snails that serve as the primary intermediate host for the fluke
in Asia have been found in the Estuary.
The burrowing activity of mitten crabs may accelerate the erosion of banks
and levees [along rivers and some estuaries].
The mitten crab has become a nuisance for commercial Bay shrimp trawlers in
South Bay, as it is time consuming to remove the crabs from the nets (one
trawler has reported catching over 200 crabs in a single tow several
times). Shrimp trawlers have reported that a large catch of mitten crabs
damages and even kills the shrimp, making them unsuitable for the bait
market. Shrimp trawlers have been able to move to areas with fewer crabs,
but, as the mitten crab population grows, this option diminishes. - Mod.TG]
