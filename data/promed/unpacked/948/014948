The Animal Husbandry Department has directed its officials in all districts to immediately report any outbreak of anthrax, a bacterial infection affecting cattle.

The directive comes following the deaths of 2 head of cattle to the disease in Gowribidanur and Srinivasatarahalli of Chikkaballapur district on [Wed 8 Jul 2015].

P T Sreenivas, Deputy Director, Animal Disease Surveillance cell of the department, told Express that veterinarians confirm an outbreak of the disease when they find blood oozing from the mouth, nose and other natural openings of the dead animals.

He said, "Normally, if there is an outbreak of anthrax, the bacteria will kill the animal but will also leave spores. These spores, if exposed to air, will survive for over 40 years and may cause infection in healthy animals and can be a risk to human health. Hence, after an outbreak is confirmed, animals within a radius of 10 km should be vaccinated."

The department has given standing instructions to all veterinarians to inspect animals for the disease and advise cattle and sheep owners to dispose of the carcasses with caution, he said.

"The owners may sell the dead animal without knowing the potential danger it poses; this is wrong. The animal has to be buried at a depth of 15 feet. All equipment used to carry the animal, like rope and logs, should also be buried and covered in limestone to stop the spread of infection," Dr Gayathri, Assistant Director, Animal Disease Surveillance of the department, said.

[In India, southern states are more prone to anthrax. During 1991-2010, anthrax was reported in 18 states of India: Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Gujrat, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Manipur, Meghalaya, Odisha, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal. Although several regions are endemic for anthrax, seasonal fluctuations in the number of anthrax outbreaks have been observed. Most of the anthrax outbreaks are reported in post-monsoon season. Several southern states such as Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka and Orissa are common endemic regions with sporadic human anthrax cases reported from time to time [1].

The newswire above states that the veterinarians confirm an outbreak of the disease when they find blood oozing from the mouth, nose and other natural openings of the dead animals. A peculiar feature of anthrax infection in animals is that blood does not clot and drains from the natural orifices like nose, mouth and bowel. This results in contamination of soil and water with bacteria which ultimately transform into spores. The persistence of anthrax in an area is the ability of _B. anthracis_ to form long-lasting, highly resistant spores.

Some soil factors like high pH (alkaline pH), high calcium content, moisture, and ambient temperature of more than 15.5 C [60 F] favor the germination of _B. anthracis_ spores into vegetative bacteria, which ultimately results in amplification of the number of spores. These soil spores cause new infections when they come into contact with a suitable host.

It is not enough to alert the public when an anthrax case is detected during clinical examination of the herd. An immediate restriction needs to be imposed on all activities in the area to prevent the spread of the disease.
