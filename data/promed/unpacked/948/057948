Award-winning milk firm Trioni, a Welsh farming success story, has
suffered a devastating setback after its dairy herd was hit by bovine TB.

Some 335 cows from its dairy herd of 390 are to be slaughtered in an
attempt to stop the disease in its tracks. Some 230 youngstock have
already been culled.

The family-run business, which makes the Daioni range of organic
flavored milk, has insisted production levels will not be affected.
It has also stressed the TB outbreak poses no health risk to
consumers, as all its milk is pasteurized.

Trioni's founder and managing director Laurence Harris said: "We
would like to emphasize that business will continue as normal, as we
have always sourced milk from other OMSCO farms (organic milk
suppliers co-operative) in Pembrokeshire as well as our own."

The company is working with the State Veterinary Service and Assembly
Government to control the outbreak. Culling of dairy cows will start
tomorrow [7 Jan 2009].

Mr. Harris admitted it was "without doubt" a stressful time for
staff, but he thanked people for their support. He added: "We are
deeply saddened for this to be happening to our farming business. In
time, we will look to rebuild our herd but will never be able to
replace them, as 3 generations of hard work have gone into building
the Ffosyficer herd."

Trioni developed its Daioni ("goodness" in Welsh) range of organic
milk drinks as an alternative to the fizzy sugary drinks generally
available for children and launched them in 2003.

The multi award-winning business has expanded its customer base to
include the Welsh Rugby Union and a number of Premiership football
teams. It also exports to several countries.

[DEFRA's provisional bovine TB statistics for Great Britain (England,
Wales and Scotland) from 1 Jan 2008 to 30 Sep 2008, as updated on 1
Dec 2008, are available in 6 pdf tables (Great Britain, West Region,
North Region, East Region, Wales, and Scotland), which are accessible at
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/tb/stats/latest.htm>.

According to the said tables, the total current number of cattle
herds registered in Great Britain is 87 258, of which 5399 herds
(6.19 percent) were under TB2 restrictions because of a TB incident
at some time during the said period. This is an unusually high
incidence for a west-European country.

The detailed Bovine TB Statistics for Wales pertaining to the said
period are available at
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/tb/stats/08/sept08wales.pdf>.
The number of cattle herds registered in Wales is 13 875, of which
1610 (11.6 percent!!) were under TB2 restrictions. The situation in
Wales deteriorated during 2008: During the entire year in 2007, there
were 447 confirmed new TB incidents, compared to 406 such incidents
(temporary data) during January-September 2008.

The deplorably deteriorated bTB situation in the UK has already been
reflected in the introduction of infected animals into importing
farms elsewhere (see postings 20080718.2186 and 20080909.2813). - Mod.AS]
