[This is the first time that Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 has been reported in Libya.

Libya is a country in the Maghreb region of North Africa bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, Egypt to the east, Sudan to the southeast, Chad and Niger to the south, and Algeria and Tunisia to the west. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya

Libya is divided into 22 sha`biyat (sing. sha`biyah: districts). Tubruq (Tobruk) is the capital of the district of Al Butnan. http://www.statoids.com/lkl.html which borders to the east with Egypt's Matruh Governorate. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butnan_District

According to the OIE's WAHID database, from January to June 2013 Egypt reported 86 outbreaks of HPAI H5N1. For further details of these outbreaks, select the disease, region/country and year at: http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statusdetail

Other countries which border Libya report HPAI as being absent [Sudan (April 2006) and Niger (June 2006)], and as never reported (Algeria and Tunisia). Sudan, Algeria y Tunisia indicate that they apply "general and targeted surveillance" as control measures, and Niger indicates only applying "general surveillance". There is no information on Chad. http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statuslist

The Asian strain of avian influenza H5N1 virus has been confirmed in poultry and wild birds in several countries in the following regions: Asia, Europe, Africa and the Middle East. While this demonstrates the rapid and ongoing geographical spread of the virus, information to date has shown that the greatest risk to humans arises when the virus becomes established in small backyard poultry flocks, which allow continuing opportunities for close human contact, exposures, and infections to occur. http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/h5n1/index-eng.php
