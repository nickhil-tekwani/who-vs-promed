The West Nile virus probably killed a man who died at a hospital [in Fargo,
North Dakota], doctors said on Tue 2 Sep 2002. It is North Dakota's fourth
human case and first fatality from the mosquitoborne disease. "This was an
unfortunate case... but we knew the infection was in our community and we
knew the potential we could have deaths," said Dr John Baird, the health
officer for Cass County and Fargo.
The man died at MeritCare Hospital late last week, about 6 days after being
admitted, Dr Paul Carson said. He had an underlying illness and a weakened
immune response system that made him more susceptible to the virus, said
Carson, a MeritCare infectious disease specialist. The man told doctors he
had been outside and remembered being bitten by mosquitoes, and the
hospital ordered West Nile tests, Carson said. The man then developed a
high fever and cognitive problems that were symptoms of the encephalitis
that killed him, Carson said.
The victim was in his mid-70s and from the Fargo area. (...) The state
Health Department is confirming the results of tests MeritCare had done at
a private laboratory and will send samples to the US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, said Larry Shireley, the state epidemiologist (...)
Shireley said cooler weather is cutting the number of mosquitoes, and the
fall's first frost should kill those that remain. (...) Health officials
said last week that 3 North Dakotans had been infected by the virus. Those
people had recovered, Shirely said.
The state has tested 56 human blood samples and has 30 under way, said
Tracy Miller, who coordinates North Dakota's West Nile prevention program.
Tests have confirmed 361 cases in horses and 31 in birds, Miller said. (...)
