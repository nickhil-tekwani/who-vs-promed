Passionfruit production declines
--------------------------------
Lack of access to loans and disease outbreaks have led to a decline
in passionfruit production in Uasin Gishu District [Rift Valley
Province]. The area recorded this season a decline in acreage under
production from 164 hectares to 150 [405 acres to 370]. The situation
was made worse due to lack of certified seeds.

According to an agricultural report, passionfruit production was
expected to increase by over 6000 metric tonnes this season but the
projections were not achieved due to disease outbreak and high cost
of production. Uasin Gishu produced 52 500 metric tonnes of
passionfruit. The report calls for the provision of grants in farm
inputs to increase production and attain food security.

[Commercial passionfruit (_Passiflora edulis_, _P. edulis_ var.
_flavicarpa_ and hybrids) is a valuable crop in eastern and southern
Africa with Kenya being one of the leading producers. The
establishment and expansion of the crop has been hindered by various
problems, the major one being disease attack.

The most important diseases of passion fruit in Kenya are considered
to be brown spot caused by the fungus _Alternaria passiflorae_ which
is spread with infected materials, by wind and water; and woodiness
disease which may be caused by _Cucumber mosaic virus_ (CMV),
_Passionfruit woodiness virus_, _Alfalfa mosaic virus_ (AMV), or a
combination of these or possibly other viruses as well.

It is not apparent from the report above which disease(s) may have
caused the recent yield decline. The lack of certified seed mentioned
may have contributed if, for example, woodiness is the problem, since
some of the possible viruses (such as AMV and CMV) may be seed
transmitted in some hosts to various degrees.
