Twenty head of cattle have died of foot and mouth disease in West Pokot
District since a quarantine order was declared last month. Briefing the
Press in his office yesterday, the District Veterinary Officer, Dr. James
Merisya, attributed the deaths to vaccine shortages. Merisya named the
worst hit areas as Kapenguria, Chepareria, Sigor, Kongelai and Lelan.
He appealed for assistance from private groups to supply vaccines to avert
further deaths. "Since the disease affects the mouth, cows are having
difficulties in feeding, leading to low supply of milk," he said. [The
blisters on the feet are painful and discourage the animal from foraging. -

Local leaders led by the Ford Kenya branch organising secretary, Mr. David
Bulimo, have accused the Government of deliberately marginalizing the area.
Bulimo said more animals are likely to die in rural areas since roads have
collapsed.
