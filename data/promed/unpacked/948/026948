Restrictions on animal movements brought in after the Surrey outbreak
of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) have been eased.
Farmers in England will be able to move calving cows and their calves
under tight restrictions from Saturday [18 Aug 2007].
Chief veterinary officer Debby Reynolds issued the movement license
"to help resolve animal welfare issues" that had arisen in the dairy
sector.
Restrictions will remain in place within the protection and
surveillance zones around affected farms in Surrey.
Tough controls on livestock movement were put in place after the
outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease 2 weeks ago.
Restrictions on taking animals to abattoirs have already been lifted,
but many movements of livestock -- such as sending animals to market
-- are still banned in England.
A spokesman for the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs (Defra) said the new license would allow cows around the time
of calving and their calves to be moved up to 50 km.
Animals would have to be checked for signs of FMD before being moved,
and strict biosecurity measures would have to be adhered to, Defra
said.
There were issues over animal welfare because cows would be giving
birth away from their usual farm base, Defra said.
FMD has been confirmed at 2 farms near Guildford within a 10-km (6.2
mile) surveillance zone in Surrey, and 2 further farms in the county
have been found clear of the disease.
Further tests on cattle at a farm in Romney Marsh, Kent and on
animals at Chessington World of Adventures in Surrey have also proved
negative.
The government is awaiting the results of independent tests on soil
from the outbreak site near Guildford.
The Health and Safety Executive said it had received the results of
the tests from the Pirbright laboratory site and would report back to
ministers once the data had been analyzed.
Leading microbiologist Professor Hugh Pennington said on Sunday [12
Aug 2007] that the FMD outbreak could effectively be over by this
weekend if no new cases emerged.

Restricted Movement of Calving Cows Permitted
---------------------------------------------
Farmers will be able to move calving cows under certain conditions as
of Sat 18 Aug 2007 in a further relaxation of FMD movement
restrictions.
After extensive discussions with industry representatives on Fri 17
Aug 2007 evening, Defra's Chief Veterinary Officer Debby Reynolds
issued a new movement license to help resolve animal welfare issues
that have arisen in the dairy sector during the current FMD outbreak.
The new license will allow bovines around the time of calving (and
their calves) to be moved up to 50 km under strict conditions of
biosecurity and following a veterinary assessment of their welfare
and freedom from FMD.
Moving the bovines will be possible only if there have been no
movements of FMD-susceptible animals for the previous 20 days onto
that site. This will apply throughout England, with the exception of
the Protection and Surveillance Zones in Surrey.
Information on the latest situation on the FMD outbreak can be found
on the Defra website at:

[The formulation of specific movement conditions for "bovines around
the time of calving (and their calves)" to be applied "throughout
England, with the exception of the Protection and Surveillance Zones
in Surrey," bestows upon these animals, in fact, a status which is
somewhat compatible with a "subpopulation." The definition of
"subpopulation" in OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code is "a
distinct part of a population identifiable according to specific
common animal health characteristics." It will be interesting to
follow this trend in view of the new concept of compartmentalization
in the Code; see chapter 1.3.5: "ZONING AND COMPARTMENTALISATION" at
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/mcode/en_chapitre_1.3.5.htm>.
