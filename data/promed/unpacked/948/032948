Malaria in Mumbai
------------------
The state government on Thursday [15 Jul 2010]
admitted that Mumbai had become the malaria
capital of the state. Out of the total cases
registered in the state, 47 percent were from the
city. Public health minister Suresh Shetty said
that though the state percentage had declined by
12 percent, the number of cases in Mumbai, Thane
and Nashi went up by 7, 10 and 1 percent respectively.
Of the 22 159 people reported to be suffering
from malaria till 10 June 2010, 12 393 were in
the city. In 2008-09, the death toll in the state
was 166, including 104 in Mumbai, the minister
said. Shetty said only 2 percent of the
construction work contractors were following the
norms laid down by the civic body to contain malaria.
"There are 2500 ongoing constructions in the
city. Even though the civic body made compliance
of the anti-larvae treatment compulsory for
developers to get the intention of
disqualification for the construction, none of
the builders follow it. Now, the BMC has decided
to recover the expenses from the developers," the minister said.
An official from the public health department
alleged that BMC officials were protecting the
developers. "Criminal cases should have been
registered against developers who weren't following the norms," he said.
The official also claimed that five wards in the
city had the maximum number of victims. "Lack of
sanitation, filth and contaminated water are the
major reasons of the epidemic in the wards in
eastern and western suburbs," he said.
The minister said 700 paramedical workers and 396
fogging workers had been appointed by the BMC to contain malaria.

[Mumbai is regarded as a low risk area, but this
applies to affluent areas only. The report state
that 22 159 cases of malaria were registered in
Mumbai between 1 Jan and 10 Jun 2010. This is
still low considered that Mumbai has
approximately 14 million inhabitants (Wikipedia).
Furthermore, a previous study (Karn and Harada.
Water Sci Technol. 2002;46:269-75) found that
malaria was common in slum areas of the city with
an annual incidence of 126 per 1000 population.
The report mentions that construction workers and
construction sites have been targeted for an
malaria spraying campaign based on the assumption
that the present situation is due to lack of
control at construction sites. Based on the study
by Karn and Harada it could just as well be an
extension of malaria in the slum areas of the city. ­ Mod.EP]
