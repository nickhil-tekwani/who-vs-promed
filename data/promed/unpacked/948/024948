Influenza update 133 [6 May 2011]
---------------------------------
Summary
-------
- Worldwide influenza activity is currently low.
- Influenza activity across the entire temperate Northern Hemisphere
is generally back to baseline or pre-seasonal levels
- As levels of influenza activity decrease, influenza type B has
become more commonly detected compared to influenza A viruses across
the Northern Hemisphere temperate areas and in much of the tropics.
- Transmission in tropical areas of the world is also generally low
with some transmission reported in countries of Sub-Saharan Africa
with a mixture of viruses and slight predominance of influenza type
B.
- In the temperate areas of the southern hemisphere the influenza
season has not yet started.
- Nearly all influenza A viruses tested continue to be antigenically
similar to those found in the current trivalent vaccine. More than 90
percent of the influenza type B viruses are also of the lineage found
in the vaccine (Victoria lineage); however, a small number of B
viruses of the Yamagata lineage are also being reported.

Countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
North America

Influenza activity continued to decline both in Canada and the USA.
In Canada the influenza-like illness (ILI) consultation rate has
decreased. Both adult and pediatric hospitalizations with influenza
were similar to previous weeks. Most provinces and territories report
no or sporadic activity though there has been a slight increase in
reported influenza outbreaks, primarily in the Atlantic provinces. The
overall proportion of samples testing positive for influenza during
week 16 was 7.2 percent (1.9 percent influenza A, 5.3 percent
influenza B), which represents a continued decreased from previous
weeks. In the USA, the proportion of outpatient ILI visits was 1.3
percent, which is below the national baseline. Laboratory-confirmed
influenza-associated hospitalizations and deaths have decreased and
were almost back to pre-seasonal levels; however the percentage of all
deaths due to pneumonia and influenza reported from the 122 cities
surveillance system remained at or above the epidemic threshold for
the 13th consecutive week. The percentage of specimens testing
positive for influenza declined further from previous weeks to 4.3
percent, with 43 percent due to influenza B. Of the influenza A
positive samples, 64 percent were influenza A(H3N2), 26 percent
unsubtyped, and 10 percent influenza A(H1N1)2009. In Mexico the
percentage specimen testing positive for influenza increased slightly
from 9 percent to 14 percent. This increase was primarily H1N1 (2009)
related and follows a recent report of an H1N1 (2009) outbreak in the
northern state of Chihuahua.

Europe
------

ILI activity was below baseline or at pre-seasonal levels in most
countries. There was a further decrease in SARI [severe acute
respiratory infection] hospitalizations in countries with SARI
sentinel surveillance. Georgia is an exception with an increase mainly
in the 0-4 year old age group, but none of the specimens tested were
positive for influenza. The numbers of ILI and SARI samples that
tested positive for influenza further decreased to 5 percent and 3
percent respectively. Of the few influenza samples that tested
positive, 55 percent were due to influenza B, and 35 percent due to
influenza A(H1N1)2009.

North Africa and the Middle East
--------------------------------
Influenza activity continued to decline, with very low numbers of
influenza type B and H1N1 (2009) reported in Algeria, Tunisia, and the
Islamic Republic of Iran.

Northern Asia
-------------
[Eastern Asia circulation of influenza viruses (snapshot)

In temperate areas of Asia, influenza activity was also low and
primarily associated with influenza B and a smaller proportion of
influenza A(H3N2). In Northern China, ILI activity remained low with
3.2 percent of visits to sentinel hospitals being for ILI, which is
noted to be below that observed during the previous 3 seasons. The
proportion of specimens testing positive for influenza was 5 percent
and all were due to influenza B. ILI activity was also declining in
Mongolia and no influenza virus was detected. In the Republic of
Korea, ILI activity remained low with low level of circulation of
influenza A(H3N2) and influenza type B. In Japan, where ILI activity
remained low, of the 184 influenza viruses detected during the month,
1 percent were influenza A(H1N1)2009, 40 percent were influenza
A(H3N2) and 59 percent were influenza type B.

Countries in the tropical zone
------------------------------
Influenza activity in the tropical zones is generally low. In
sub-Saharan Africa, Ghana and Kenya both report ongoing transmission
of a mix of H1N1 (2009) and influenza type B. Madagascar reports
decreasing detections of influenza viruses which have been a mix of
influenza type B and H3N2 with type B slightly more common. In
tropical countries of Asia, ILI activity has been low and the few
viruses detected have been a mixture of primarily H1N1 (2009) and
influenza type B.

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Influenza activity has not increased in the temperate zone of the
southern hemisphere. Australia continues to report on low but
decreasing levels of influenza, primarily A(H3N2) viruses primarily in
tropical and subtropical areas of the country.

Source of data
--------------
The Global Influenza Programme monitors influenza activity worldwide
and publishes an update every 2 weeks. The updates are based on
available epidemiological and virological data sources, including
FluNet (reported by the Global Influenza Surveillance Network) and
influenza reports from WHO Regional Offices and Member States.
Completeness can vary among updates due to availability and quality of
data available at the time when the update is developed.

The current situation is that the northern hemisphere winter
influenza epidemic is now virtually over, and the southern hemisphere
epidemic has yet to begin. - Mod.CP]
