Potentially Dangerous Mosquito Vector Found at New Site
-------------------------------------------------------
The feared southern saltmarsh mosquito has spread to Kaipara Harbour,
northwest of Auckland. The Ministry of Health has announced that larvae of
the mosquito were [found in the Rodney district area of Kaipara Harbour
last week during routine surveillance. [The identification of the samples
had been confirmed in Australian laboratories as the southern saltmarsh
mosquito (_Aedes camptorhyncus__. [Subsequently adult mosquitoes were found
also in the same area.
_Aedes camptorhyncus_ mosquitoes were first found at Napier in December
1998, and later at Muriwai, Mahia and Porangahau and Mahia in Hawke's Bay.
This mosquito, widespread in Australia and other countries, is capable of
carrying several non-fatal but dangerous and long-lasting diseases. Public
health officials fear the mosquito because it can [transmit Ross River
virus. This virus causes a disease known as epidemic [benign polyarthritis,
and in some patients can cause chronic fatigue and lethargy for up to a
year. Ross River virus has not been detected in New Zealand, but if the
mosquitoes became established they could easily pick it up from an infected
visitor, such as an Australian tourist. The virus would likely then be
transmitted to animal "reservoirs" such as feral possums or farm livestock,
and become almost impossible to eradicate. There have been no reported cases
of infection with such diseases by mosquitoes in New Zealand. But scientists
say that with the saltmarsh mosquito present, all of the factors needed for
establishment of the disease -- except the virus itself -- are present.
Ministry Chief Technical Officer For Biosecurity, Bob Boyd, said that the
finding showed the national surveillance programme was working. But it was
"extremely disappointing to find this unwanted mosquito at another site,
well away from previous finds". Dr Boyd said the Ministry and local Public
Health Service had established an intensive survey covering more than 150ha
to determine the potential habitat and location of colonies in the Kaipara
area. A progress report would be presented to an expert technical advisory
group early next week. "The ministry will use the advice from the group as
it considers the possible long-term response to the southern saltmarsh
mosquito in New Zealand." Dr Boyd noted that the eradication programme in
Napier had progressed well and no adult mosquitoes or larvae had been found
in the area for many months. But the programme had to run another 2 years
before eradication could be certain.
Currently 24ha at Porangahau, 63ha at Mahia and 86ha in the Gisborne area
were being treated with s-methoprene to contain the mosquito. The Ministry
said it was not known how the southern saltmarsh mosquito got to Kaipara or
how widespread it was. The insect liked coastal areas but was thought to
have only a 5km-flight range. The Kaipara area had been subject to routine
surveillance for some time, a programme that was enhanced when the southern
saltmarsh was discovered in Gisborne last October. The Ministry added it
couldn't be sure the mosquito had not spread further afield. It had been due
to report to the Government by 21 May 2001 on options for a long-term
response to the mosquito. "The implications of this new finding will be
included in the ministry's advice."
People living in the Kaipara Harbour area have been asked to hand in mosquito
specimens to the Public Health Service and report any incidents where they
suspect the presence of the mosquito. The southern saltmarsh mosquito is
known to be an "aggressive day-time biter", whereas [most endemic mosquitos
are more commonly active at night.
