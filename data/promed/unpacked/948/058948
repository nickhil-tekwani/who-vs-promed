A 3rd death has been linked to a bug outbreak at Cambridge's world-renowned Royal Papworth Hospital [in Cambridge, England]. [The patient] underwent a double lung and heart transplant at the hospital. Just months later, he suffered devastating complications and died, aged 26.

His widow, said: 'It's difficult to find the words to describe the last few months and trying to come to terms with what happened. 'What's even more worrying is that a number of patients at the hospital around the same time were diagnosed with infections, with serious consequences.'

[The patient] was found to have the rare bug _Mycobacterium chelonae_ [now called _Mycobacteroides chelonae_- Mod.JH], which attacks bone and skin tissue, 6 months after his June 2019 operation. The same bug had been discovered in the hospital's water supply.

In August 2019, the deadly bug _Mycobacterium abscessus_ [now called _Mycobacteroides abscessus_- Mod.JH] was also found in the supply after the hospital moved to a new GBP 200 million [about USD 263.7 million] site in Cambridge. A total of 21 patients were infected, 5 of whom had received transplants.

Last month [February 2022], we revealed a coroner had launched an investigation into the 2020 deaths of [a patient], 54, and [another patient], 60, who had been infected with it.

Inquests into all 3 deaths are due to be held later this year [2022]. The families are represented by law firm Irwin Mitchell, who said: 'They have all been devastated by what happened.'

Royal Papworth contests that [the 26-year-old's] death is linked to the same outbreak, saying: 'There has never been a recorded outbreak of _M. chelonae_ at our Trust.'

[_Mycobacteroides (formerly _Mycobacterium_) abscessus_ and _Mycobacteroides (formerly _Mycobacterium_) chelonae_ are both acid-fast bacilli that are part of a grouping separate from _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ complex, known as non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) (http://www.cdc.gov/hai/organisms/mycobacterium.html). NTMs are environmental mycobacteria, found in natural and potable freshwater and soil. NTM can form biofilms on the inner surfaces of water distribution systems, which are resistant to chlorine (https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2020.00190/full), constituting a risk for certain people by microaspiration or by inhalation of aerosols. Water from these systems can also contaminate medications and medical instruments.

NTM differ among themselves based on in vitro growth rate and colonial pigmentation:
- Rapidly growing, non-pigmented mycobacteria (RGM) produce mature growth on agar plates within 7 days of incubation and include the _Mycolicibacterium (formerly _Mycobacterium_) fortuitum_ complex and the _M. chelonae-abscessus_ group (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33304323/). The _M. abscessus_ subset includes _M. abscessus_ sensu stricto, _M. massiliense_ and _M. bolletii_.
- Slowly growing NTM, which require more than 7 days to produce mature growth on agar plates, include _Mycobacterium marinum_, _M. gordonae_. _M. kansasii_, and the _M. avium/intracellulare_ complex. Other slow growers include _M. ulcerans_, _M. haemophilum_, and _M. simiae_.

_M. abscessus_ is a multidrug-resistant organism. It is resistant to most beta-lactams, likely due to its bacterial cell wall biochemistry and to a broad-spectrum, chromosomally encoded Ambler class A beta-lactamase (BlaMab) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6167491/). Of the beta-lactam subclasses, carbapenems have the greatest activity against _M. abscessus_, and among the carbapenems, imipenem the most activity against _M. abscessus_ (https://jcm.asm.org/content/54/6/1586).

Imipenem is currently recommended as part of 1st-line treatments for _M. abscessus_ infections. Meropenem, another carbapenem, is less active than is imipenem when used alone against _M. abscessus_. BlaMab is resistant to inhibition by the beta-lactamase inhibitors clavulanate, tazobactam and sulbactam (https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/69/3/691/784297). However, 2 newer non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitors -- relebactam (marketed with imipenem) and vaborbactam (marketed with meropenem) -- improve the activity of both these carbapenems against _M. abscessus_ (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-57844-8 and https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6395916/). Combinations of different beta-lactam subclasses, such as amoxicillin plus imipenem/relebactam, may be required to fully inhibit peptidoglycan biosynthesis in _M. abscessus_ (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-57844-8).

The erm(41) gene, which confers inducible macrolide resistance through methylation of ribosomal RNA, is present in the _M. abscessus_ complex group, but many strains of _M. massiliense_ have a nonfunctional erm(41) gene, and because of this, the rate of macrolide susceptibility is higher in _M. massiliense_ than in the other _M. abscessus_ complex organisms (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4550155/). Efflux pumps have also been shown to contribute to macrolide resistance in _M. abscessus_ (https://www.dovepress.com/efflux-pumps-contribute-to-intrinsic-clarithromycin-resistance-in-clin-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-IDR).

_M. chelonae_ most commonly causes infection of the skin and skin structures, such as surgical site and implantable device infections. _M. chelonae_ is not macrolide-resistant and does not have an erythromycin methylase (erm) gene so macrolides are effective for treating _M. chelonae_ infections, whereas they are generally not effective for _M. abscessus_ infections because most isolates have an active erm gene (https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/10.1513/AnnalsATS.201501-015OI).

Unlike _M. chelonae_, _M. abscessus_ is a pulmonary pathogen. Infection with _M. abscessus_ is usually treated with a combination therapy of amikacin, tigecycline, cefoxitin, and imipenem, combined with oral clarithromycin or azithromycin, if the patient's isolate is macrolide susceptible, for one month, followed by a combination of clofazimine, linezolid, minocycline, moxifloxacin, or co-trimoxazole for 12 months, depending on results of susceptibility testing. See the guidelines from the US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) and the European Cystic Fibrosis Society (ECFS) at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4717371/, and the British Thoracic Society at <https://thorax.bmj.com/content/72/Suppl_2/ii1.long for specific recommendations.

More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
