West Nile virus fatalities now total 17
---------------------------------------
Less than 24 hours after Health Minister Roni Milo declared that
West Nile fever here was "not an epidemic," 2 more elderly people died
yesterday of its complications: an 81-year-old man from Kibbutz Kabri and a
91-year-old man from Hod Hasharon. In addition, the ministry "discovered"
another 81-year-old man who had died several weeks ago but had been listed
merely as having come down with the disease. The 3 deaths brought the
number of fatalities to 17 since the middle of July. In addition, another 10
surviving patients were diagnosed yesterday, bringing the total to 237. The
man from Kabri - one of the places hardest hit by the mosquito-borne virus -
was hospitalized at Nahariya Hospital for the past few weeks. The Hod
Hasharon man was being treated at Meir Hospital in Kfar Sava.
Residents of the northern kibbutz have been shocked and confused by the
death of one of its founders and the hospitalization of several other
members due to complications of the disease. Members claimed they had
eliminated mosquito-breeding sites and had used the pesticide "fogging"
technique to eliminate adult mosquitoes, but the disease has still hit hard.
"There is not always a direct link between the appearance of the disease and
the presence of mosquitoes," said Lev last week. "Kabri is an example of
that. It's possible that mosquitoes from a neighboring settlement infected
people, or there was some subtle change in the ecological balance that we
don't yet understand." The Agriculture Ministry's veterinary service has
tested some of the large number of pigeons in the kibbutz, but the results
have reportedly been negative. West Nile fever passes harmlessly when it
affects otherwise-healthy people, but it can cause encephalitis or
meningitis in elderly people and others with a weak immune system.
There were reports yesterday that Milo hurried to deny last week's statement
by ministry associate director-general, Dr. Boaz Lev, that the phenomenon
was an "epidemic", because of concerns among would-be foreign tourists about
coming to Israel.
Health Ministry spokesman Yoram Malka has been dismissed, and according to
one newspaper report, it was due to his unsuccessful efforts at explaining
the West Nile fever situation to the public. But the ministry, while
confirming his dismissal, did not explain the reason for it.
