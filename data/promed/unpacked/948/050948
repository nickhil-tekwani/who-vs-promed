--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants highlighted the need to better understand adaptive immune responses to this virus. It is important to address whether also CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses are affected, because of the role they play in disease resolution and modulation of COVID-19 disease severity. Here we performed a comprehensive analysis of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses from COVID-19 convalescent subjects recognizing the ancestral strain, compared to variant lineages B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, and CAL.20C as well as recipients of the Moderna (mRNA-1273) or Pfizer/BioNTech (BNT162b2) COVID-19 vaccines. Similarly, we demonstrate that the sequences of the vast majority of SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes are not affected by the mutations found in the variants analyzed. Overall, the results demonstrate that CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in convalescent COVID-19 subjects or COVID-19 mRNA vaccinees are not substantially affected by mutations found in the SARS-CoV-2 variants.

[This is very encouraging news. Concern has been high that the variants will escape neutralization in vaccinated and previously infected people. But T cell responses are important to disease resolution and this study suggests they will likely be equally effective in controlling disease following infection with mutants as with wild type virus. - Mod.LK]

[2] Brazil: crisis, death surge
[A] Crisis
Date: Wed 3 Mar 2021

COVID-19 has already left a trail of death and despair in Brazil, one of the worst in the world. Now, a year into the pandemic, the country is setting another wrenching record. No other nation that experienced such a major outbreak is still grappling with record-setting death tolls and a healthcare system on the brink of collapse. Many other hard-hit nations are, instead, taking tentative steps toward a semblance of normalcy. But Brazil is battling a more contagious variant that has trampled one major city and is spreading to others, even as Brazilians toss away precautionary measures that could keep them safe.

On Tuesday [2 Mar 2021], Brazil recorded more than 1700 COVID-19 deaths, the highest single-day toll of the pandemic. "The acceleration of the epidemic in various states is leading to the collapse of their public and private hospital systems, which may soon become the case in every region of Brazil," the national association of health secretaries said in a statement. "Sadly, the anemic rollout of vaccines and the slow pace at which they're becoming available still does not suggest that this scenario will be reversed in the short term."

And the news just got worse for Brazil -- and possibly the world. Preliminary studies suggest that the variant that swept through the city of Manaus is not only more contagious, but it also appears able to infect some people who have already recovered from other versions of the virus. And the variant has slipped Brazil's borders, showing up in 2 dozen other countries and in small numbers in the United States.

Although trials of a number of vaccines indicate they can protect against severe illness even when they do not prevent infection with the variant, most of the world has not been inoculated. That means even people who had recovered and thought they were safe for now might still be at risk, and that world leaders might, once again, be lifting restrictions too soon.

"You need vaccines to get in the way of these things," said William Hanage, an epidemiologist at Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, speaking of variants that might cause reinfections. "The immunity you get with your cemeteries running out of room, even that will not be enough to protect you."

That danger of new variants has not been lost on scientists around the world. Rochelle Walensky, the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, pleaded with Americans this week not to let their guards down. "Please hear me clearly," she said. "At this level of cases with variants spreading, we stand to completely lose the hard-earned ground we've gained."

Brazilians hoped they had seen the worst of the outbreak last year [2020]. Manaus, capital of the northern state of Amazonas, was hit so hard in April and May [2020] that scientists wondered if the city might have reached herd immunity. But then in September [2020], cases in the state began rising again, perplexing health officials. An attempt by Amazonas governor Wilson Lima to impose a new quarantine ahead of the Christmas holiday was met with fierce resistance by business owners and prominent politicians close to President Jair Bolsonaro.

By January [2021], scientists had discovered that a new variant, which became known as P.1, had become dominant in the state. Within weeks, its danger became clear as hospitals in the city ran out of oxygen amid a crush of patients, leading scores to suffocate to death.

Since then, the coronavirus crisis has eased somewhat in Amazonas, but worsened in most of Brazil.

Scientists have scrambled to learn more about the variant and to track its spread across the country. But limited resources for testing have kept them behind the curve as they try to determine what role it is playing. Anderson Brito, a Brazilian virologist at Yale University, said his lab alone sequenced almost half as many coronavirus genomes as all of Brazil had. While the United States has done genetic sequencing on roughly one in 200 confirmed cases, Brazil sequences about one in 3000.

The variant spread quickly. By the end of January [2021], a study by government researchers found it was present in 91 percent of samples sequenced in the state of Amazonas. By the end of February [2021], health officials had reported cases of the P.1 variant in 21 of 26 Brazilian states, but without more testing, it is hard to gauge its prevalence.

Throughout the pandemic, researchers have said that COVID-19 reinfections appear to be extremely rare, which has allowed people who recover to presume they have immunity, at least for a while. But that was before P.1 appeared and doctors and nurses began to notice something strange.

Joao Alho, a doctor in Santarem, a city in Para, a state that borders Amazonas, said that several colleagues who recovered from COVID-19 months ago had fallen ill again and tested positive.

Juliana Cunha, a nurse in Rio de Janeiro who has been working at COVID-19 testing centers, said she assumed she was safe after catching the virus last June [2020]. But in November [2020], after experiencing mild symptoms, she tested positive again. "I couldn't believe it," Ms Cunha, 23, said. "It must be the variants."

But there is no way to be sure what is happening to people who are reinfected unless both their old and new samples are kept, genetically sequenced, and compared.

One way to tamp down the surge would be through vaccinations, but the rollout in Brazil, as in so many countries, has been slow. Brazil began vaccinating priority groups, including health care professionals and the elderly, in late January [2021]. But the government has failed to secure a large enough number of doses. Wealthier countries have snapped up most of the available supply, while Mr Bolsonaro has been skeptical both of the disease's impact and of vaccines.

Just over 5.8 million Brazilians -- roughly 2.6 percent of the population -- had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine as of Tuesday [2 Mar 2021], according to the health ministry. Only about 1.5 million had received both doses. The country is currently using the Chinese-made CoronaVac -- which laboratory tests suggest is less effective against P.1 than against other variants -- and the one made by the British-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca.

Margareth Dalcolmo, a pulmonologist at Fiocruz, a prominent scientific research center, said Brazil's failure to mount a robust vaccination campaign set the stage for the current crisis. "We should be vaccinating more than a million people per day," she said. "That is the truth. We aren't, not because we don't know how to do it, but because we don't have enough vaccines."

Other countries should take heed, said Ester Sabino, an infectious disease researcher at the University of Sao Paulo who is among the leading experts on the P.1 variant. "You can vaccinate your whole population and control the problem only for a short period if, in another place in the world, a new variant appears," she said. "It will get there one day."

Health minister Eduardo Pazuello, who called the variant a "new stage" of the pandemic, said last week [week of 23 Feb 2021] that the government was ramping up its efforts and hopes to vaccinate roughly half of its population by June [2021] and the rest by the end of the year [2021].

But many Brazilians have little faith in a government led by a president who has sabotaged lockdowns, repeatedly downplayed the threat of the virus, and promoted untested remedies long after scientists said they clearly did not work. Just last week, the president spoke dismissively of masks, which are among the best defenses to curb contagion, claiming that they are harmful to children, causing headaches and difficulty concentrating.

Mr Pazuello's vaccine projections have also been met with skepticism. The government last week placed an order for 20 million doses of an Indian vaccine that has not completed clinical trials. That prompted a federal prosecutor to argue in a legal filing that the USD 286 million purchase "puts millions of lives at risk." Even if it proves effective, it will be too late for many.

[The Brazilian health care system clearly is in a dire situation, with the variant(s) circulating, the low proportion of the population vaccinated, lack of oxygen, insufficient numbers of beds, and people encouraged not to wear masks. There needs to be a global effort to get Brazilians and members of other low- and middle-income countries vaccinated. Immunization needs to be global to be effective. If the virus is transmitted at a high rate in such countries as Brazil, more mutations will occur leading to a greater chance of spread. The best path forward to protection from the virus and its variants, along with masks and physical distancing, is immunization of the population. - Mod.LK]

[B] Deaths surge
Date: Wed 3 Mar 2021

Brazil on Tuesday [2 Mar 2021] posted its highest number of deaths from COVID-19 in a single day as political infighting exacerbated the country's health crisis and the pace of its vaccination roll-out faltered. Some 1641 people died from COVID-19 on Tuesday [2 Mar 2021], according to Health Ministry data, surpassing the previous single-day high of 1595 deaths recorded in late July 2020. More than 257 000 people have died of the disease in Brazil, making it the deadliest outbreak in the world after the United States.

The COVID-19 pandemic has pushed Brazil's hospital system to the brink of collapse, and state governors are now joining together to buy vaccines and bypass the federal government, which has been slow to roll out its vaccine programme. Brazil has continued to have a piecemeal response to the deadly disease, with individual cities and states setting their own policies in the face of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro's repeated attacks on restrictive measures and face masks. Last week [week of 23 Feb 2021], Bolsonaro disparaged the use of face masks, saying they could lead to headaches and a "decreased perception of happiness." He had also threatened to cut funding to cities and states that adopt stricter lockdowns.

Roughly 10.6 million people of the country's 212 million population have been diagnosed with COVID-19 since the pandemic began, according to the Health Ministry, with 59 925 new cases reported on Tue [2 Mar 2021].

Sam Cowie, a journalist based in Sao Paulo, described the situation as a "bleak and scary time". The pressure on the health system is so acute that, during the weekend [27-28 Feb 20201], at least 5 COVID-19 patients died while waiting for hospital beds, in Sao Paulo's neighbouring state of Santa Catarina, Cowie told Al Jazeera. "What we are seeing here is an absolute health catastrophe, and that is exacerbated by the new variant first detected in Manaus," he said.

Brazil began its vaccination programme in mid-January [2021], but is behind schedule on a government pledge of immunising the entire population by the end of the year [2021]. Only 3 percent of the country's population has been vaccinated, according to the latest official statistics.

Experts have warned that if Brazil is unable to control the spread of the COVID-19, it could become the epicentre of the mutation of the virus, which could potentially be more infectious and lethal.

The coronavirus variant that was first identified in Manaus in the Brazilian Amazon towards the end of last year [2020] triggered a renewed wave of cases that left the city's hospitals without oxygen in January [2021].

Research is currently underway to test the efficacy of the coronavirus vaccines against the variant, which has prompted countries to close their borders to people travelling from Brazil.

[3] Obesity: impact on prognosis
Date: Thu 4 Mar 2021
Source: Al Jazeera [edited]
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/3/4/study-suggests-strong-link-between-obesity-and-covid-death-rate


The death rate from COVID-19 is about 10 times higher in countries where half or more of the population is overweight, according to a report by the World Obesity Federation.

The report released on Wednesday [3 Mar 2021] titled COVID-19 and Obesity: The 2021 Atlas has shown that being overweight is a "highly significant predictor" of developing complications from contracting COVID-19 such as hospitalisation, intensive care, and mechanical ventilation, as well as being a "predictor of death" from the disease. The researchers say that countries in which fewer than 40 percent of people are overweight had fewer coronavirus-linked deaths, whereas countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, and Italy, where more than 50 percent of the population is overweight, had a much higher death rate. "An overweight population is an unhealthy population, and a pandemic waiting to happen," the report said.

The report flagged that in the UK, 73.7 percent of 10 465 patients who were critically ill with confirmed COVID-19 were overweight or obese. Meanwhile, Viet Nam has the lowest level of overweight people in the population and the world's 2nd lowest COVID death rate. It also highlighted that overweight and obesity could be risk factors for dangerous outcomes in people under 60 years old, with those who have a body mass index (BMI) between 30 and 34 twice as likely to be admitted to ICU compared with the ones with a BMI under 30.

"Reducing one major risk factor, overweight, would have resulted in far less stress on health services and reduced the need to protect those services from being overwhelmed," the report found, suggesting that people who are obese or overweight should be prioritised for testing and vaccination.

A survey last month [February 2021] by the [US] Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the obesity rate in the United States was 42 percent, higher than the 40 percent found in a 2015-16 study. COVID-19 has killed more than 500 000 people in the US so far and 2.56 million across the world.

Information collected over the past 2 decades has also shown that excess body weight is linked to worse outcomes in MERS, H1N1 influenza, and other influenza-related infections.

[An excellent discussion of the impact of obesity on COVID was published in 2020. See:

Wadman M. Why obesity worsens COVID-19. Science. 2020 Sep 11;369(6509): 1280-1281. doi: 10.1126/science.369.6509.1280. PMID: 32913079.
https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6509/1280.full (abridged, edited)

"Since the pandemic began, dozens of studies have reported that many of the sickest COVID-19 patients have been people with obesity. In recent weeks, that link has come into sharper focus as large new population studies have cemented the association and demonstrated that even people who are merely overweight are at higher risk. For example, in the 1st meta-analysis of its kind, published on 26 Aug 2020 in Obesity Reviews, an international team of researchers pooled data from scores of peer-reviewed papers capturing 399 000 patients. They found that people with obesity who contracted SARS-CoV-2 were 113% more likely than people of healthy weight to land in the hospital, 74% more likely to be admitted to an ICU, and 48% more likely to die. (https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/08/200826083015.htm)

"A constellation of physiological and social factors drives those grim numbers. The biology of obesity includes impaired immunity, chronic inflammation, and blood that's prone to clot, all of which can worsen COVID-19. And because obesity is so stigmatized, people with obesity may avoid medical care.

"We didn't understand early on what a major risk factor obesity was. ... It's not until more recently that we've realized the devastating impact of obesity, particularly in younger people," says Anne Dixon, a physician-scientist who studies obesity and lung disease at the University of Vermont. That "may be one reason for the devastating impact of COVID-19 in the United States, where 40% of adults are obese."

"People with obesity are more likely than normal-weight people to have other diseases that are independent risk factors for severe COVID-19, including heart disease, lung disease, and diabetes. They are also prone to metabolic syndrome, in which blood sugar levels, fat levels, or both are unhealthy and blood pressure may be high. A recent study from Tulane University of 287 hospitalized COVID-19 patients found that metabolic syndrome itself substantially increased the risks of ICU admission, ventilation, and death.

"But on its own, "BMI [body mass index] remains a strong independent risk factor" for severe COVID-19, according to several studies that adjusted for age, sex, social class, diabetes, and heart conditions, says Naveed Sattar, an expert in cardiometabolic disease at the University of Glasgow. "And it seems to be a linear line, straight up."

"The impact extends to the 32% of people in the United States who are overweight. The largest descriptive study yet of hospitalized US COVID-19 patients, posted as a preprint last month [August 2020] by Genentech researchers, found that 77% of nearly 17 000 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were overweight (29%) or obese (48%). (The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines overweight as having a BMI of 25 to 29.9 kilograms per square meter, and obesity as a BMI of 30 or greater.)

"Another study captured the rate of COVID-19 hospitalizations among more than 334 000 people in England. Published last month [August 2020] in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences [2020 Sep 1;117(35):21011-21013. doi: 10.1073/pnas.2011086117. Epub 2020 Aug 11; https://www.pnas.org/content/117/35/21011.long], it found that although the rate peaked in people with a BMI of 35 or greater, it began to rise as soon as someone tipped into the overweight category (see graphic at URL above). "Many people don't realize they creep into that overweight category," says 1st author Mark Hamer, an exercise physiologist at University College London.

"The physical pathologies that render people with obesity vulnerable to severe COVID-19 begin with mechanics: Fat in the abdomen pushes up on the diaphragm, causing that large muscle, which lies below the chest cavity, to impinge on the lungs and restrict airflow. This reduced lung volume leads to collapse of airways in the lower lobes of the lungs, where more blood arrives for oxygenation than in the upper lobes. "If you are already starting [with] this mismatch, you are going to get worse faster" from COVID-19, Dixon says.

"Other issues compound these mechanical problems. For starters, the blood of people with obesity has an increased tendency to clot--an especially grave risk during an infection that, when severe, independently peppers the small vessels of the lungs with clots (Science, 5 Jun 2020; 368 (6495: 1039; https://science.sciencemag.org/content/368/6495/1039). In healthy people, "the endothelial cells that line the blood vessels are normally saying to the surrounding blood: 'Don't clot,'" says Beverley Hunt, a physician-scientist who's an expert in blood clotting at Guy's and St Thomas' hospitals in London. But "we think that signaling is being changed by COVID," Hunt says because the virus injures endothelial cells, which respond to the insult by activating the coagulation system. Add obesity to the mix, and the clotting risk shoots up. In COVID-19 patients with obesity, Hunt says, "You've got such sticky blood, oh my -- the stickiest blood I have ever seen in all my years of practice."

"Immunity also weakens in people with obesity, in part because fat cells infiltrate the organs where immune cells are produced and stored, such as the spleen, bone marrow, and thymus, says Catherine Andersen, a nutritional scientist at Fairfield University. "We are losing immune tissue in exchange for adipose tissue, making the immune system less effective in either protecting the body from pathogens or responding to a vaccine," she says.

"The problem is not only fewer immune cells but less effective ones, adds Melinda Beck, a co-author of the Obesity Reviews meta-analysis who studies obesity and immunity at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. Beck's studies of how obese mice respond to the influenza virus demonstrated that key immune cells called T cells "don't function as well in the obese state," she says. They make fewer molecules that help destroy virus-infected cells, and the corps of "memory" T cells left behind after an infection, which is key to neutralizing future attacks by the same virus, is smaller than in healthy weight mice.

"Beck's work suggests the same thing happens in people: She found that people with obesity vaccinated against flu had twice the risk of catching it as vaccinated, healthy weight people. That means trials of vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 need to include people with obesity, she says, because "coronavirus vaccines may be less effective in those people."

"Beyond an impaired response to infections, people with obesity also suffer from chronic, low-grade inflammation. Fat cells secrete several inflammation-triggering chemical messengers called cytokines, and more come from immune cells called macrophages that sweep in to clean up dead and dying fat cells. Those effects may compound the runaway cytokine activity that characterizes severe COVID-19. "You end up causing a lot of tissue damage, recruiting too many immune cells, destroying healthy bystander cells," says Ilhem Messaoudi, an immunologist who studies host responses to viral infection at the University of California, Irvine. Of the added risk from obesity, she adds: "I would say a lot of it is immune-mediated."

"The severity of COVID-19 in people with obesity helps explain the pandemic's disproportionate toll in some groups. In American Indians and Alaska Natives, for example, poverty, lack of access to healthy food, lack of health insurance, and poor exercise opportunities combine to render "rates of obesity ... remarkably high," says Spero Manson, a Pembina Chippewa who is a medical anthropologist at the University of Colorado's School of Public Health. And obesity "is connected to all these other [illnesses], such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease, rendering us susceptible" to severe COVID-19, Manson says."

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (12 countries) include Brazil, USA, France, Italy, India (16 824), Poland (15 253), Czech Republic (15 230), Peru (11 550), Germany (11 410), Russia (11 385), Turkey (11 322), and Ukraine (10 057). A total of 51 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 26 of the 51 countries are from the European region, 9 are from the Americas region, 9 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 2 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 1.3%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 6.6%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 10.4% decrease in daily reported cases and a 17.0% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: There were more than 459 000 newly confirmed infections reported globally in the past 24 hours with over 116.20 million cumulative reported cases and over 2.58 million reported deaths. Comparative 7-day reported cases and reported deaths are showing major daily fluctuations that are hard to explain. - Mod.MPP]
