The dioxins and furans from a single, large transformer, if burned in a hot
fire, are fearsome. The State Office Building in Binghamton, New York is a
good example. It had to be abandoned and still stands (as far as I know) as
a dioxin monument in the middle of a major city, because a single
transformer in the basement of the building caught fire and spread dioxins
and furans into the heating ducts. When I last checked (a couple of years
ago) it could not be dismantled because of the threat of spreading the
poisons through the city.
In Canton, Massachusetts, a farmhouse full of PCB transformers burned,
leaving a huge plume of very severe dioxin contamination all over the town,
and [contaminating several residences so that they are included in what is
now a Superfund site [receiving Federal funds for cleanup.
If the transformer oil is, say, 50% or 100% PCB, then there could be several
KILOGRAMS of dioxins and furans that could be released in gaseous and
adsorbed form. If I remember right, that is approximately the amount
released in the Seveso disaster in Italy.
The chlorophiles are quite wrong technically about gaseous dioxin. The point
about these chemicals (PCBs, dioxins, furans) is that they are constantly
changing state between gas/liquid state (in adsorbed media) and gaseous
state. This is stated quite definitively in the EPA dioxin reassessment --
that we live in a dioxin/furan cloud that hovers very near to the ground. In
a PCB fire the main amount of dioxins are going to be carried in microscopic
and sub-microscopic particulates from the fire, spread all over the city
depending on the weather at the time of the fire. The amount of dioxin will
be measurable (as it was with the vinyl fire in Hamilton, Ontario).
If the chlorophiles work in vinyl or other organochlorine plants, they need
to understand that they are part of a poisonous, destructive technology.
