The state Department of Public Health [DPH] has opened an investigation into a Rocky Hill nursing home after 2 residents were diagnosed with legionnaires' disease and one of them died. DPH officials said they are coordinating a review with management at the facility, Apple Rehab. The department was notified on 17 Jul [2019] that a resident at the nursing home had contracted the disease.

Legionnaires' is a type of pneumonia caused by ingesting [inhaling aerosols or aspirating, not ingesting - Mod.ML] water that contains _Legionella_ bacteria. The bacteria are normally found in freshwater lakes and streams but can grow in man-made water systems. It was detected in samples tested at Apple Rehab, DPH officials said.

The health department did not identify the residents who contracted the disease.

"DPH and Apple Rehab personnel are continuing a joint investigation to identify the environmental source of _Legionella_ bacteria to protect patients, staff, and visitors," DPH officials said in a statement Friday [26 Jul 2019]. "DPH personnel have reviewed Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations and discussed implementation with Apple Rehab administrators."

The nursing home's water system has undergone chlorine treatment, and further testing is underway, they said. Patients, staff, and visitors have been notified of the problem.

"Moving forward, DPH will be monitoring Apple Rehab's water quality and disease-prevention measures," the department said. Records show Apple Rehab was fined twice in 2018 and twice in 2017 for deficiencies in care. The penalties amounted to $19,702 in 2018 and $33,745 in 2017. The nursing home received a 2-star rating -- below average -- by Medicare. The rating is based on heath inspections, staffing, and quality measures.

[Apple Rehab offers services for elderly adults that include short-term rehabilitation, short-term skilled nursing care, and long-term nursing care. The facility is located in Rocky Hill, Connecticut (https://www.apple-rehab.com/rocky-hill).

Rocky Hill, with a population of 19 709 in 2010, is a town on the Connecticut River in Hartford County, Connecticut, United States, between the cities of Hartford to the north and New Haven to the south (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Hill,_Connecticut). Rocky Hill can be found on a map at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Rocky+Hill,+CT.

_Legionella_ are gram-negative bacilli that are found in both natural freshwater environments, such as lakes and streams, and in manufactured plumbing systems, such as showerheads and sink faucets, cooling towers, decorative fountains, hot tubs/spas, and hot-water tanks and heaters. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 deg C [77-104 deg F] support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems.

Eradication of these bacteria from plumbing systems is often difficult. Long-term persistence within these water systems is favored by the intracellular location of _Legionella_ within several species of protozoa, where _Legionella_ replicate and which provide protection from environmental stressors, like biocides and heat treatment.

Also, the formation of biofilms allows adherence of _Legionella_ to the inner surfaces of the plumbing systems (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5835138/). _Legionella pneumophila_ have been shown to persist for long periods in biofilms in a viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state after exposure to a biocide or heat treatment (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515819/). Monitoring _L. pneumophila_ in water systems, which is usually done by culture, would miss VBNC _Legionella_, which can be revived by the subsequent addition of amoeba (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18839249).

Debilitated hospitalized patients who are prone to aspiration may develop legionnaires' disease following aspiration of _Legionella_-contaminated potable water as well as inhaling a fine spray (aerosols) from water sources containing _Legionella_. Possible person-to-person transmission has also been described (Correia AM, Goncalves J, Gomes JP, et al.: Probable person-to-person transmission of Legionnaires' disease. N Engl J Med. 2016; 374(5): 497-8. http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356).

During the epidemiological and environmental investigation for the source of _Legionella_ organisms, patients should be prohibited from taking showers and should consume only sterile water until the source has been remediated.

Genotyping the clinical isolates from the 2 cases of legionnaires' disease will help confirm if this is a common source outbreak, if the genotypes match. Matching the genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_ will identify the environmental source for the individual cases. However, if the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping. - Mod.ML
