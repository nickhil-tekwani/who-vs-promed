Abstract
-------
Tick‐borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is recognized as the most important zoonotic tick‐transmitted virus in Europe. TBEV is mainly transmitted to humans through bites from TBEV‐infected ticks (_Ixodes ricinus_ and _Ixodes persulcatus_). However, alimentary infection after consumption of unpasteurized milk and cheese from domestic ruminants has been reported. There is little information about TBEV in ruminants in Norway. The objectives of this study were to analyse unpasteurized cow milk for TBEV RNA and to study the presence of IgG antibodies to TBEV in the same animals. A total of 112 milk and blood samples were collected from cows from 5 different farms spread from southern to northern Norway. The milk samples were analysed by an in‐house reverse transcription (RT) real‐time polymerase chain reaction and confirmed by pyrosequencing. Serum samples were screened by a commercial enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay and verified by a TBEV‐specific serum neutralization test. We found TBEV RNA in unpasteurized milk collected from farms in the municipalities of Mandal, Skedsmo, and Bronnoy in 5.4% of the tested animals. Specific antibodies to TBEV were only detected in Arendal, where 88.2% of the tested animals were positive. Further studies on milk containing TBEV RNA should be performed to conclude if TBEV found in unpasteurized milk in Norway is infectious, which could be of great importance in a One Health perspective.

[Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) can be shed in milk from infected cattle and infect people if the milk is not pasteurized. The above finding of evidence of TBEV RNA from cattle in Norway is of public health significance, and as the authors note, warrants further studies to determine if infectious virus is being shed. This study provides further evidence that consumption of raw (unpasteurized) milk can have adverse health consequences for those consuming it.

TBE is a virus infection caused by one of 3 TBE virus subtypes belonging to the Flaviviridae family: Central European, Siberian, and Far Eastern (formerly known as Russian spring-summer encephalitis). Although not stated, the virus in Norway is probably the Central European subtype. As reported in a previous post (see Tick borne diseases - Norway: environmental change 20130417.1653480), Norway represents the northern distribution limit in Europe for the tick _Ixodes ricinus_, and its distribution is influenced by climate changes. Investigators found that occurrences of the most common species of tick in Norway (_I. ricinus_) have been reported considerably further north and higher up in mountainous regions than was formerly the case. The distribution pattern of _I. ricinus_ has changed substantially over the last 50 years, and one can now expect to find this tick as far north as Harstad, which is 400 km [249 mi] further north than previous records. The tick has also been detected at altitudes as high as 700-800 metres [2300-2625 ft] above sea level. This means that there is an increased risk of humans and animals becoming infected and falling ill from TBEV infections in new areas of the country. The occurrence of TBE has been documented in several parts of Norway for the 1st time. This post reports that research shows the occurrence of the virus responsible for TBE in infected areas is at an equivalent level to that shown in other European studies. - Mod.TY
