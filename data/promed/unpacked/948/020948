More than 100 dengue fever cases were reported in Makkah last week
[week of 12 Apr 2009]. During the same period, 33 cases were
registered in Jeddah, a report from the Saudi Press Agency said
Monday [13 Apr 2009].

The report stated that government bodies had begun putting into
action a program to control the spread of the mosquito-borne virus,
with municipalities engaged in spraying districts and homes, and the
Ministry of Agriculture overseeing the aerial spraying of sites where
mosquitoes conglomerate.

The Ministry of Health is carrying out schemes to raise medical
awareness, facilitate laboratory diagnosis and provide patient care.
The report said that the directorates of Health Affairs in Makkah and
Jeddah were conducting intensive awareness campaigns targeting
infested homes and their vicinities.

The Sri Lanka Health authorities warned that the threat of dengue is
spreading across the Colombo city again. A spokesman for the Colombo
Municipal Council (CMC) said that this is mainly because of the
uncollected garbage in the city. About 201 dengue patients have been
reported in the Colombo city during this year alone and 4 had
succumbed to the disease, he said.

The spokesman said that because of the prevailing rainy condition,
the situation has worsened. However, several actions have been taken
to tackle the situation, by using chemicals and smoke [insecticide
fogging probably. - Mod.TY] to destroy mosquito breeding grounds, the
spokesman added.

[If vector mosquito control measure are only aimed at adult
mosquitoes, the effects will be short-term. Control by elimination of
breeding sites in water catchments in and around houses and other
buildings is necessary for long-term control.

Dengue fever killed 2 people in Malaysia's Selangor State, raising
the death toll to 39 people so far in 2009 compared to 26 mortalities
during the same period last year [2008], it was announced Friday [17
Apr 2009].

Malaysia's Director General of Health, Dr. Mohammad Ismail Merican,
said in a press statement that a total of 794 dengue fever cases were
reported last week compared with 923 cases the previous week,
recording a 14 percent decline.

Total cases during 2009 reached 10 645 compared to 15 825 cases
during the same period in 2008. According to the Health Ministry,
some 96 contaminated areas, including 95 areas in Selangor State
which embraces the Malaysian capital, were in Sarawak, eastern
Malaysia. The ministry announced in February [2009] the rising number
of dengue fever cases by 55 percent compared to last year.

Dengue fever had turned into an epidemic in September 2007. Dengue
fever cases are rising up due the increasingly high temperatures and
the heavy rain showers -- a suitable environment for the mosquito
_Aedes_ to multiply and spread the fever [virus]. No treatment is
available for dengue fever, and the disease is life threatening.

Unseasonal rains increase dengue fever cases
--------------------------------------------
Recent unseasonal rains have caused dengue fever outbreaks to rise
sharply in Ho Chi Minh City [HCMC]. Since February [2009], the city's
Children's Hospital No.1 received 30 to 35 patients with dengue fever
per day. From the beginning of April [2009] the figure has risen to
80 patients per day. The Tropical Diseases Hospital last week
received more than 150 patients with dengue fever, an increase of 100
percent compared with the same period last year [2008].

Dr. Le Bich Lien, dean of the Dengue Fever Department at the city
children's hospital No.1, said unseasonal rains have caused
mosquitoes and larvae to develop earlier.

HCMC districts 8, Thu Duc, Tan Binh and Tan Phu are worst hit, with
cases of dengue fever up by as much as 300 percent over the same
period last year [2008], says Nguyen Dac Tho, deputy director of the
city's Health Preventive Center. Mr. Tho has instructed local health
officials to take precautionary measures against the disease, as well
as warn residents to remain vigilant and contain the epidemic.

Symptoms of dengue fever, a common mosquito-borne disease in
developing countries, include flu-like fever, skin rashes and severe
pain in the head and limbs. Dengue fever is transmitted by
daytime-biting mosquitoes. International health organizations
recommend people use insect repellant and cover legs and arms.

[Although unseasonal rain could provoke more dengue infections
through an increase in the vector mosquito population, elimination of
mosquitoes breeding places around the dwelling places and raising of
public awareness on preventive measures against mosquitoes bite can
counteract that effect and reduce the disease burden of dengue
infection. During a survey conducted by the centre in districts 12, 6
and Binh Thanh districts of Ho Chi Minh City, mosquitoes were found
in more than 90 percent of the houses (see prior PRO/MBDS posting
Dengue - Viet Nam (02): Ho Chi Minh City 20090402.1267).

Other areas in the south of Viet Nam have also been affected by
increases in dengue fever cases. More than 310 cases of dengue fever
(DF) and 96 dengue shock syndrome (DSS) were admitted to Can Tho City
Children's Hospital, mostly from Can Tho City, Hau Giang, Soc Trang,
Vinh Long, and Dong Thap provinces (see prior PRO/MBDS posting Dengue
- Viet Nam (03) 20090406.1335).

The Red Cross Blood Service says the dengue fever epidemic in north
Queensland is continuing to put a dent in the state's blood supplies.
The service can only use plasma from donor blood collected in dengue
affected areas because there is no way to test red blood cells and
platelets for the virus.

The service's Tony Bourke says Townsville and Cairns normally produce
14 percent of the state's donor blood supply, with donations required
from other regions over coming months. "It's about 750 a week and 60
platelets a week that we're having to supply from other parts of
Queensland and occasionally we're receiving support from other states
as well," he said.

precautionary measures with their blood and blood products supply.

Cook Islands has recorded 170 cases of suspected dengue fever over
the last 3 weeks, the Cook Islands News reported on Thursday [16 Apr
2009]. Cook Islands Ministry of Health this week said 13 people have
been admitted to hospital showing symptoms of the mosquito-borne
disease [virus] with results expected to be received from Australia
this week confirming the presence of a new outbreak in Rarotonga. The
ministry said that no evidence has suggested the infection has
reached the outer islands.

A national clean up campaign was undertaken last week with
environmental risk assessments and actions completed for all probable
cases. Many empty cans, bottles and plastic bags were disposed of
immediately, the daily said. Residences of the 170 probable dengue
cases were identified. This week, the public health team has assessed
known natural and man-made habitats which include the Rarotonga
Airport, seaport and other high risk areas with appropriate action
completed.

The public is urged to take preventative measures and to control the
spread of infection to keep the community safe. This is through the
clearing of mosquito breading areas and removing containers and other
water filled objects on their properties as well as using personal
protection measures like insect repellents. The public health team
will continue to do surveillance and to monitor the situation and
raise awareness.

The number of dengue cases in the [provincial] capital [Tucuman] has
tripled during the past week [week of 12 Apr 2009]. It was the city
in the province with the greatest number of recorded [dengue]
illnesses. Up to yesterday there were 317 [dengue] patients reported
in the various health centers. Cases have been detected in 31
neighborhoods, although not all [dengue infections] were locally
acquired.

In total in the province, there has been a 33 percent increase in
patients with the disease that [the causal virus of which] is
transmitted by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito. The number of ill
individuals increased to 1263 cases as of yesterday [18 Apr 2009].
The other department with the greatest increase in [dengue] disease
cases recorded is Tafi Viejo, where the number of patients has
doubled and there are now more than 100. In Rio Chico, the most
critical sector in the epidemic, there have been few cases in the
last week, with an increase of [only] 9 percent.

Nationally, dengue has affected 14 598 people, indicated the Minister
of Health, Graciela Ocana. [However,] according to physicians of the
Union of Professionals, there are more than 30 000 [dengue] cases in
the entire country, more than double the official figures. Ocana
judges that an important part in the propagation of the disease is
due to climatic change. She indicated that Catamarca [province] was a
region of medium risk [for dengue infection] and had an outbreak with
3728 cases due to regional climate change.

It is recommended that water catchments be eliminated in homes to
reduce mosquito breeding sites. [Specific detailed examples of sites
where water frequently accumulates are given in the original source
article. - Mod.TY]

Figures from the Bahia Secretariat of Health show that since the
beginning of the year [2009] 45 683 people were infected with dengue
fever [in the state]; there are 38 deaths officially attributed to
the disease and 41 [more] are suspected.

These numbers are 313 percent higher than at the same time last year
[2008]. To get an idea of the seriousness of the situation, in 2008
official data reported that there were 37 273 cases of dengue in
Bahia, a number already exceeded in the 1st 3 1/2 months of this year
[2009]. The region more affected by the outbreak of dengue is the
southern part of the state, where Porto Seguro is located, a city
visited by thousands of Portuguese for having been the location of
the discovery of Brazil. In this region, the armed forces set up
hospitals for a campaign to try to mitigate the effects of epidemic,
and medical volunteers from other Latin American countries, such as
Cuba and Venezuela, are joining together with the Brazilian
colleagues in attempt to contain the advance of the disease.
