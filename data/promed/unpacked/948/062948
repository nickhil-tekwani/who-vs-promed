'How I survived Ebola'
----------------------
Doctor Senga Omeonga is doing better. Much better; 3 weeks ago, FRANCE 24 interviewed this Congolese doctor who contracted the ebolavirus while working in Monrovia, Liberia. At the time, he was wasting away in the hallway of a hospital, without any treatment or food. Today, while he still feels weak, he no longer has the virus...

Omeonga and 2 other doctors in Liberia were given Zmapp, a drug that was tested for the 1st time in early August [2014] on 2 American health workers, who have since recovered from the virus. However, this experimental treatment hasn't cured everyone: one of the doctors in Liberia who was given ZMapp as treatment died last Sunday [31 Aug 2014]...

Omeonga has worked for the 5 years at the John Fitzerald Medical Centre in Monrovia, the capital of Liberia. He is originally from the Democratic Republic of Congo [where there is currently an unrelated outbreak of EVD -- see ProMED Hot Topics - Mod.JW]...

The 1st few days at that hospital were a real nightmare. There was not nearly enough staff or medical supplies. Since there were no rooms available, I had to wait in a hallway, lying on the ground, for a week. There was only one toilet for several dozen patients. A friend of mine came every day to give me food. In these conditions, I thought I would never survive; people around me were dying like flies. A bed finally opened up, and a doctor treated me with ZMapp. He administered it to me 3 times. I believe my status as a doctor working internationally worked in my favour in getting me this drug. Still, it was risky -- the 3rd dose of ZMapp almost killed me, since I had a strong allergic reaction to it and went into anaphylactic shock...

Since I've left the hospital, it's been interesting to see that some of my friends are a bit scared of me, at least those that don't have any medical knowledge. Many of them refuse to come visit me, thinking I may still be carrying the virus. In Liberia, people living in regions touched by the epidemic have gone into a sort of mass psychosis leading to very irrational acts... -- more

[Many people do not realize that in many underdeveloped countries, not only in Africa, with under-funded hospitals, it is customary to not only bring food to relatives in hospital, but also stay there and provide nursing care for them, to help overworked staff.

This is the 1st report I've seen of an adverse reaction to ZMapp. For further details about ZMapp, see: http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/outbreaks/2014-west-africa/qa-experimental-treatments.html. - Mod.JW]

A Grand Challenge to Help Health Care Workers Fight Ebola
---------------------------------------------------------
Announced at the Global Health Security Summit in Washington, DC, this Grand Challenge for Development will unite the global community in the quest for ingenious ideas that deliver practical and cost-effective innovations in a matter of months, not years.

We need new ideas to help ensure that treatment sites, communal transport units, and burial sites do not become infection sources. We need new solutions that strengthen the safety and increase the comfort of the suits, from improving fabric design to measuring a health worker's temperature and heart rate.

We need new ways to simplify clinical processes, including point-of-care diagnostics. And we need new tools that continue to create a safer clinical environment, including improving infection control and waste disposal. Taken together, these innovations will enable health workers to provide better care for those who are suffering.

Together with our international partners, we will translate the expertise and ingenuity of scientists, innovators, engineers, and students from across the globe into real solutions. With your bold thinking and engagement, we can give health workers the tools they need to win this fight.

To get involved, please visit: http://www.usaid.gov/grandchallenges/ebola.

[Fabric that allows air to penetrate also allows contaminated fluids to do so. Wearable temperature and heart rate monitors already exist -- but I don't think they are disinfectable. "Our goal is to get them to the field in a matter of months, to help the people working in West Africa right now. We can do this." But there is an admission that this is not going to happen right now, or even this year, while the case and death numbers continue to increase. - Mod.JW]

Suggesting Airborne Precautions for Ebola Health Care Workers Is a Really Bad Idea
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Contributing author Heather Lander, Ph.D. provides insight into why implementing airborne precautions in the EVD epidemic isn't the right strategy to prevent infection of health care workers.

[See photo at source URL of Ebola response worker wearing a respirator and no gloves! (WHO) - Mod.JW]

Recently, on ProMED [Ebola virus disease - West Africa (164): Sierra Leone, infect. control, susp. 20140914.2773490], we saw a Professor in Hygiene and Infection Control put out a call for more stringent personal protective equipment (PPE) for the Ebola epidemic. He specifically called for the implementation of airborne protection as was used during the SARS outbreak in 2003.

While I can understand why he thinks this will help -- he outlined it clearly in the email -- I strongly believe this strategy will not only not work, but will make matters worse by directing efforts away from the real problem that is causing health care workers to get infected with EVD in the 1st place.

Ebola is not airborne. [1;2] This we know. Laboratory experiments designed to study the potential of filoviruses as bioweapons have clearly shown that Ebola and Marburg are highly aerosol infectious. [3;4;5;6] However, there is absolutely no evidence that they are spread/transmitted by an airborne route and the preponderance of health care workers (HCW) getting infected is not because they are not protected against airborne ebolavirus, so implementing that kind of PPE won't help.

Contact and droplet PPE are all that is needed for ebolavirus. [7;8] The problem is that HCW in this epidemic either don't have PPE at all, only have some of it or have it, but are not properly trained in its use. In addition, there are not enough people for the work that needs to be done. But instead of quitting to get rest, food or relief from the extreme heat, these doctors and nurses are powering through, because they are looking into the eyes of those who are suffering with no one else to turn to.

They need more people. They need more PPE. They need more training. To effectively prevent HCW from getting infected, these are the problems that must be addressed. Telling people that airborne precautions will prevent their infection will actually make this situation worse: they will rely on respirators and continue not using or misusing the PPE they actually need to protect themselves.

The SARS outbreak was, in general, a success in epidemic control, but the circumstances were strikingly different, and not only because of airborne precautions. [9] ... If you want an outbreak from which to draw conclusions about how to prevent HCW infection with ebolavirus don't look at SARS, look at the 1995 Kikwit Ebola outbreak. I discuss this at length in a recent blog post. Everything we need to know, we have learned.

The problem is not that we aren't recommending the right PPE. The problem is the situation: no resources human or otherwise, no infrastructure, no training, and no hope in sight. But giving false hope by suggesting that respirators will prevent infection is irresponsible. I guarantee that if you say that the reason HCW are getting infected is because they are not implementing airborne precautions, then what they hear (and rightly so) is that airborne precautions alone will prevent infection.

Clearly, this is not the message we need to be sending to a population already failing catastrophically in proper PPE use.... The people fighting this war need education on how ebolavirus is actually transmitted and how to effectively don and remove contact/droplet PPE so they can actually protect themselves. Unfortunately, without more people to help and more PPE to wear, no amount of education or training will help.

[4] Prevention & false alarms


Cote d'Ivoire to resume flights & sea traffic to countries struck by EVD
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ivory Coast president Alassane Ouattara said on Friday [26 Sep 2014] his country will lift the controversial suspension of flights to countries stricken by EVD to show solidarity with the nations affected by the lethal outbreak.

He said the initial decision to suspend flights was prompted by uncertainty about the threat, which he called a terrible problem for the people of west Africa.... "Now that everything is under control -- there is no case of EVD in Cote d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast) -- I have decided that next week we will lift the suspension of flights and the maritime suspension." In addition, he said Ivory Coast has opened a "humanitarian corridor" so that people who want to enter Ivory Coast can be checked. The country has also contributed USD 1 million to the international anti-EVD effort.... "You can count on the government not to hide a single case of Ebola. If there is a case of Ebola, we'll say that there is a case." ... International health officials had said flight suspensions and the closure of sea ports and borders were not needed.

Cuba: to send 300 more health workers
-------------------------------------
26 Sep 2014 (You, South Africa): Cuba said it will send nearly 300 more doctors and nurses to west Africa to help fight the EVD epidemic. This will raise to 461 the number of Cuban medical personnel that the country will send to battle the disease. The Cubans will work in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia, said Regla Angulo, head of the Cuban medical relief agency. Until now Cuba had pledged 165 doctors and nurses for Sierra Leone. The staff are undergoing intense training ahead of their deployment, working in a mock field hospital of the kind they expect to find in Africa.

France: suspect case ex Guinea
------------------------------
26 Sep 2014 (Journal du Dimanche): A young Guinean presented himself Friday [26 Sep 2014] to the General Council of Haute-Garonne, Toulouse, claiming to be infected by the ebolavirus, which would have devastated his family. Suspicion was finally lifted. According to information from the Depeche du Midi, the 18-year-old arrived in France under conditions that remain unknown. "His grandmother funded his trip to France so he could escape the epidemic, " said the Toulouse daily.

[I think he was allowed in because France is not blocking entry of West Africans unless they have fever, and he doesn't. But I hope they contact his home every day for the next 3 weeks to check whether anybody there has fallen ill. It was good of him to turn himself in. - Mod.JW]

India: airport screening
------------------------
Recently, former journalist and activist Ketan Tirodkar filed ... an allegation that India is not yet fully ready to prevent EVD spread, as several people coming back from EVD hit countries are arriving at airports in Pune and Nagpur where EVD screening facilities are not available. Following that, the Bombay High Court passed an order, directing the Maharashtra Government to arrange proper screening facilities in Pune and Nagpur, similar to those existing at Mumbai and Delhi airport.... Rui Rodrigues, counsel for the Central Government, informed Bombay High Court bench ... that the scanners have been shifted from Hyderabad and Goa airports to Nagpur and Pune airports. The government confirmed that these thermal scanners would be functional within a week ... -- more

Liberia: mass delivery of EVD protection kits starts
----------------------------------------------------
A mass delivery of almost half a million household kits to help stop the spread of the deadly ebolavirus in West Africa began on Thursday [25 Sep 2014] with the 1st batch of 9000 packages.... The kits contain protective gowns, gloves and masks, as well as soap, chlorine and a sprayer, along with instructions on the use and safe disposal of materials. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) plans to distribute kits to up to 400 000 households across Liberia, which is the worst hit country with over 3280 cases and 1677 deaths according to the latest WHO figures. Sheldon Yett, representative of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) in Liberia, said about 50 000 kits will arrive in the next few months to provide a temporary solution until more treatment centres are built and staff trained....

Gayle Smith, the White House's senior director for global development on the National Security Council, said officials have identified 400 000 of the most vulnerable households and are working with community leaders to deliver health care kits. Funding for the 1st 50 000 kits has been provided by USAID and the US-based philanthropic organisation Paul G. Allen Family Foundation, which has committed a USD3.6 million matching contribution to UNICEF to support the airlift ... -- more
