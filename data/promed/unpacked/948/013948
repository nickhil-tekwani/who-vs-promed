1st Report of Cucumber leaf spot virus in Poland.
H. Pospieszny and M. Cajza, Institute of Plant Protection, Department of
Virology and Bacteriology, Miczurina 20, 60-318 Poznan, Poland; and R.
Plewa, Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan, Department of Experimental
Biology, Animal Physiology, Fredry 10, 61-701 Poznan, Poland. Plant Dis.
88:1381, 2004; published on-line as D-2004-0928-01N, 2004. Accepted for
publication 25 Aug 2004.
During April 2003, 4 young cucumber plants with slight stunting and delay
of flowering were found in 2 commercial greenhouses in the Wielkopolska
Region in Poland. Sporadically, chlorotic spots, sometimes with necrotic
centers, were observed on the leaves of plants. Later, symptoms were less
recognizable or they disappeared completely.
Crude sap from symptomatic leaves of _Cucumis sativus_ was used for
mechanical inoculation of various plant species. The virus caused local and
systemic infections on _Cucumis sativus_, _Nicotiana benthamiana_, and _N.
clevelandii_ and induced local necrotic lesions only on _Chenopodium
quinoa_, _C. amaranticolor_, _C. ficifolium_, _C. murale_, _Petunia
hybrida_, _Cucurbita melo_, _Zinnia elegans_, and _Spinacia oleracea_. No
symptoms were seen in inoculated _N. tabacum_, _N. glutinosa_,
_Lycopersicon esculentum_, _Capsicum annuum_, _Physalis floridana_,
_Phaseolus vulgaris_, and _Cucurbita pepo_. Symptoms and host range were
similar to those described for infection by Cucumber leaf spot virus (CLSV)
(1).
Electron microscopic examination of negatively stained leaf-dip preparation
from infected plants showed spherical virus particles (approximately 30
nm). Total RNA extracted from symptomatic _C. sativus_ and _N. benthamiana_
plants, and RNA extracted from purified virus preparations were tested
using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with
specific primers designed to amplify a fragment of the RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase gene (4). RT-PCR products were sequenced with CEQ DTCS dye
terminator cycle sequencing kit and the CEQ 2000 DNA Analysis System
(Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA).
The 664-nt amplicon sequence (GenBank Accession No. AY571334) had 95
percent nucleotide and 98 percent amino acid sequence identity with the
Spanish CLSV isolate (GenBank Accession No. AY038365) (4) and 98 and 99
percent identity, respectively, with another CLSV isolate (3). The nucleic
acid sequence of the Polish CLSV isolate was 81-84 percent identical to the
equivalent region of 2 isolates of Pothos latent virus, another aureusvirus
(GenBank Accession No AJ243370 and X87115) and had 86 percent identity with
the amino acid sequence of both isolates.
To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of CLSV in Poland. The virus was
previously reported in Germany, Great Britain, Jordan, Greece, Saudi
Arabia, Spain, and Bulgaria (1,2,4). CLSV is a member of the genus
_Aureusvirus_, formerly Carmovirus (family _Tombusviridae_). In the 1st
half of 2004, no cucumber plants testing positive for CLSV were found. This
incidental occurrence of CLSV indicates that the virus is not a significant
threat to cucumber in Poland at this time.

[Aureusvirus is a new genus of plant viruses typified by Pothos latent
virus (PoLV) and comprising cucumber leaf spot virus (CLSV), previously
classified as definitive species in the genus Carmovirus. Aureusviruses are
soil-borne viruses readily transmitted by sap inoculation to a moderate
range of hosts. Natural transmission of CLSV is by the chytrid fungus
_Olpidium bornovanus_ [Ob], (previously _O. radicale_), whereas PoLV
infects the host without the apparent intervention of a vector. A bulk
culture of _Olpidium radicale_ (now classified as Ob) from melon roots
collected at Montfavet, France did not transmit CLSV or the cucumber fruit
streak strain of CLSV (CLSV-FS). CLSV is sap-transmitted, and is seed-borne
(c.1 percent) and soil-borne. Found naturally only in cucumber. Reported
from Germany, Greece, Great Britain and Jordan (Weber et al., 1982, 1986;
Gallitelli et al., 1983) and Spain. CLSV is most likely related to Melon
necrotic spot carmovirus (MNSV), red clover necrotic mosaic dianthovirus
(RSNMV) and cucumber necrosis tombusvirus (CNV). CLSV is an Aureusvirus in
the family _Tombusviridae_ and is most closely related to Pothos latent
virus. The scientific name for pothos is _Epipremnum aureum_; its common
name is devil's ivy.
