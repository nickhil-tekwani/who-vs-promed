[2] WHO: Disease Outbreak News
- Fri 21 Sep 2018. Ebola virus disease - Democratic Republic of the Congo
[WHO Emergencies preparedness, response, Disease Outbreak News (DONs); edited]
http://www.who.int/csr/don/20-september-2018-ebola-drc/en/

The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) remains active. Although substantial progress has been made to limit the spread of the disease to new areas and the situation in Mangina (Mabalako Health Zone) is stabilizing, the cities of Beni and Butembo have become the new hotspot. Response teams continue to enhance activities to mitigate potential clusters in these cities and prevent spread to other areas.

Significant risks for further spread of the disease remain. Continued challenges include contacts lost to follow-up, delayed recognition of EVD in health centres, poor infection prevention and control (IPC) in health centres, and reluctance among some cases to be treated in Ebola treatment centres (ETCs). Although the majority of communities have welcomed response measures, in some, risks of transmission and poor disease outcomes have been amplified by unfavourable behaviours, with reluctance to adopt prevention and risk mitigation strategies. The priority remains strengthening all components of the public health response in all affected areas, as well as continuing to enhance operational readiness and preparedness in the non-affected provinces of the DRC and neighbouring countries.

Since the last Disease Outbreak News (data as of 12 Sep 2018), 5 new confirmed EVD cases were reported: 4 from Beni and 1 from Butembo health zones. All have been linked to ongoing transmission chains within these respective communities.

As of 18 Sep 2018, a total of 142 EVD cases (111 confirmed and 31 probable), including 97 deaths (66 confirmed and 31 probable) [1] have been reported in 7 health zones in North Kivu Province (Beni, Butembo, Kalunguta, Mabalako, Masereka, Musienene, and Oicha), and Mandima Health Zone in Ituri Province. An overall decreasing trend in weekly case incidence continues; however, these trends must be interpreted with caution given the expected delays in case reporting and the ongoing detection of sporadic cases. Of the 135 probable and confirmed cases for whom age and sex information is known, adults 35 to 44 years of age (23%) and females (56%) accounted for the greatest proportion of cases. Cumulatively, 19 (18 confirmed and one probable) health workers have been affected to date, 3 of whom have died.

The Ministry of Health (MoH), WHO, and partners continue to closely monitor and investigate all alerts in affected areas, in other provinces in the DRC, and in neighbouring countries. As of 18 Sep 2018, 9 suspected cases are awaiting laboratory testing. Since the last report was published, alerts were investigated in several provinces of the DRC, as well as in neighbouring countries; to date, EVD has been ruled out in all alerts from neighbouring provinces and countries.

Public health response
The MoH continues to strengthen response measures, with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include coordinating the response, surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory capacity, IPC measures, clinical management of patients, vaccination, risk communication and community engagement, safe and dignified burials (SDB), cross-border surveillance, and preparedness activities in neighbouring provinces and countries.

As of 18 Sep 2018, 209 experts, including emergency coordinators, epidemiologists, laboratory experts, logisticians, clinical care specialists, communicators, and community engagement specialists, have been deployed by WHO to support response activities.

More than 5000 contacts have been registered to date, of which 1983 remain under surveillance as of 18 Sep 2018 [2].

As of 19 Sep 2018, 58 vaccination rings have been defined, in addition to 24 rings of health workers and other frontline workers. These rings include the contacts (and their contacts) of all confirmed cases from the past 4 weeks. To date, 10 701 people consented and were vaccinated, including 4008 healthcare or frontline workers, and 2362 children. The ring vaccination teams are currently active in 3 health areas in North Kivu and one in Ituri.

ETCs remain fully operational in Beni and Mangina with support from The Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA) and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), respectively. MSF Switzerland and the MoH are supporting a temporary treatment center in Butembo, where a fully functional ETC will open soon. The Makeke ETC in Ituri Province, which is supported by International Medical Corps (IMC), was inaugurated on 18 Sep 2018. Samaritan's Purse continues to support IPC activities in Bunia.

ETCs continue to provide therapeutic agents under the monitored emergency use of unregistered and experimental interventions (MEURI) protocol in collaboration with the MoH and the Institut National de Recherche Biomedicale (INRB). WHO is providing technical clinical expertise and mentoring on-site.

WASH and IPC activities are ongoing in the DRC and are supported by a number of partners in the field. Numerous activities have occurred in health facilities in the affected areas, which include facility assessments, decontamination of centres, establishment of triage areas, and training on standard precautions, as well as Ebola-specific IPC measures, which include personal protective equipment donning and doffing.

The MoH, WHO, UNICEF, Red Cross, and partners are intensifying activities to engage with local communities in the affected areas. Local leaders, religious leaders, opinion leaders, and community networks such as youth groups, women's groups and motorbike taxi drivers are being engaged on a daily basis to support community outreach for Ebola prevention and early care-seeking through active dialogues on radio, community gatherings, and house-to-house visits. Community feedback is being systematically collected, and concerns are being addressed. Local frontline community outreach workers are working closely with Ebola response teams to strengthen community engagement and psychosocial support in contact tracing, patient care, SDBs, and vaccination of close contacts. The current focus is to intensify activities aimed at addressing community concerns through direct partnership with community members.

Expert teams have deployed to 6 at-risk provinces (Bas Uele, Haut Uele, Ituri, Maniema, South Kivu, and Tanganika) to facilitate implementation of priority readiness actions, including strengthening multisectoral coordination, surveillance for early detection, laboratory diagnostic capacity, points of entry (PoE) surveillance, rapid response teams, risk communication, social mobilization and community engagement, case management and IPC capacities, operations support, and logistics.

As of 17 Sep 2018, health screening has been established at 43 PoEs, and close to 4 million travellers have been screened at these PoEs.

To support the MoH, WHO is working intensively with a wide range of multisectoral and multidisciplinary regional and global partners and stakeholders for EVD response, research, and urgent preparedness, including in neighbouring countries. This includes the UN secretariat, sister agencies, including International Organization for Migration (IOM), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), World Food Programme (WFP), United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), multiple clusters, and peacekeeping operations; World Bank and regional development banks; African Union, and Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and regional agencies; Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), Steering Committee, technical networks and operational partners, and the Emergency Medical Team Initiative. GOARN partners continue to support the response through deployment for response and readiness activities in non-affected provinces and in neighbouring countries.

WHO risk assessment
This outbreak of EVD is affecting northeastern provinces of the DRC, which border Uganda, Rwanda, and South Sudan. Potential risk factors for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels include the transportation links between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries; the internal displacement of populations; and the displacement of Congolese refugees to neighbouring countries. The country is concurrently experiencing other epidemics (e.g., cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis) and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu and Ituri continues to hinder the implementation of response activities. Based on this context, the public health risk was assessed to be high at the national and regional levels and low globally.

As the risk of national and regional spread remains high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure health authorities are alerted and operationally ready to respond.

WHO advice
WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to the DRC based on the currently available information. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no countries have implemented any travel restriction to and from the DRC. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

[3] Ugandan border
- Fri 21 Sep 2018. Congo confirms Ebola case at Ugandan border
[Reuters, edited]
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-ebola-congo-uganda/congo-confirms-ebola-case-at-ugandan-border-idUSKCN1M11WC

Democratic Republic of Congo has confirmed a case of Ebola on its border with Uganda, a country so far clear of the deadly virus, authorities in Congo said on Fri [21 Sep 2018].

The new infection is almost 200 km (125 miles) away from the nearest other known case in Congo's current Ebola outbreak, which is believed to have killed 97 people since July [2018] and infected another 46 in North Kivu and Ituri provinces.

Ituri province's Vice Governor Keta Upar said in a statement that the latest Ebola case had been reported in Tchomia on the shores of Lake Albert. It is the closest the disease has come to Uganda, Congo's eastern neighbor.

Uganda's health ministry said on Thu [20 Sep 2018] it was preparing to deploy vaccinations against the virus should it spread to its territory.

Congo has experienced 10 outbreaks of Ebola since it was discovered in the country's forested north in 1976. The disease causes hemorrhagic fever, vomiting, and diarrhea and kills about half of the people it infects.

Health officials have made progress slowing the spread of the virus with experimental vaccines and treatments. But violence and turmoil in eastern Congo has made some areas difficult to access.

Dozens have been killed in ethnic clashes between groups in Djugu territory where Tchomia is located, with thousands crossing into Uganda to escape the violence.

- Fri 21 Sep 2018. Ituri: a lady died of the Ebola virus in Tchomia (confirmed positive by INRB)
[Radio Okaspi, online transl., edited]
https://www.radiookapi.net/2018/09/21/actualite/sante/ituri-une-dame-est-decedee-du-virus-ebola-tchomia

A woman died on Thu 20 Sep 2018 at the general reference hospital of Tchomia, 60 km (37 miles) south of Bunia (Ituri). The vice governor of Ituri province, Pacific Keta, says results of the samples sent to the laboratory of the National Institute for Biological Research (INRB), based in Beni, North Kivu, are positive.

"I want to inform the people of Ituri in general and Tchomia in particular about the death occurred Thu 20 Sep [2018] at the general hospital around 8 o'clock in the morning. It is a 32-year-old [woman]," says Pacifique Keta.

He said that the victim participated in the burials of Ebola cases in Beni of 2 patients. "She [HK] was followed by the Beni medical team as a suspected case of contact. She refused the vaccination, disappeared from Beni, then went to Komanda but not found," said the vice-governor.

A joint delegation from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Provincial Health Division visited Tchomia. The team aims to identify and vaccinate all those who have come into contact with the patient, strengthen infection prevention and control measures, and train health providers to deal with reported cases.

[This highlights the challenge the DRC faces in controlling the Ebola outbreak. It is critical to impress upon all individuals in the DRC the highly infectious nature of Ebola virus and that burials must be conducted in a safe manner, avoiding exposure to bodily fluids. It is unfortunate this woman refused vaccination. It would be good to include authoritative community members as part of the vaccination team to explain to contacts in a manner they can understand and accept that they should not be afraid of the vaccine, and why it is important to allow the healthcare workers to vaccinate them. Perhaps this is already being done, but people remain resistant. - Mod.LK]

- Thu 20 Sep 2018. Uganda to deploy Ebola vaccine if virus spreads from Congo
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-ebola/uganda-to-deploy-ebola-vaccine-if-virus-spreads-from-congo-idUSKCN1M02R2

Uganda will vaccinate against Ebola should it spread from Democratic Republic of Congo, which has been hit twice this year, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Thu [20 Sep]. Uganda borders Congo's Ituri and North Kivu provinces, where Ebola is believed to have killed 97 people since the latest outbreak started in July, and infected another 45.

A death from Ebola was recorded this month in the Congolese city of Butembo , which is a hub for Congolese mineral exports and imports from East African ports via Uganda.

In a statement on Thu, the WHO said it was assisting Uganda, which has remained clear of Ebola so far this year, to set up the "ring vaccination" strategy being used in Congo.

Under the strategy, every contact of an Ebola case including health workers and family members is traced and vaccinated.
"The opportunity that vaccinating frontline health workers and ring vaccination provides to contain the disease (...) is one that must never be missed. That's why we are making all these costly but necessary preparations", WHO's Uganda Representative Yonas Tegegn Woldermariam said in the statement.

Uganda has identified spaces to store the vaccine and installed equipment to ensure it can be transported nationwide.
Uganda has had 5 outbreaks since 2000, the latest in 2017. The contagious disease causes hemorrhagic fever, vomiting and diarrhea.

[This is very timely in view of the report of a fatal case near the border of Uganda in Tchomia on the shores of Lake Albert. Thorough preparedness in advance of the potential spread of Ebola virus is a wise approach. It might even be better to vaccinate frontline workers now, ahead of virus introduction to the country, giving them a chance to develop a strong immunological response. Vaccination of high-risk populations can take place as needed when cases are identified, but healthcare workers will need to be protected at the first sign of a case. It would be informative to know whether other neighboring countries are also planning their response to possible Ebola virus introduction. - Mod.LK
