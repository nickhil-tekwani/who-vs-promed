----------------------------------------------------------------------
This item on grayanotoxin states, "travelers to areas such as the Black Sea region of Turkey, North America, Korea, Japan, Nepal, and New Zealand should pay special attention as there have been reported cases of grayanotoxin poisoning which were attributed to honey from these areas."

The toxin most commonly associated with honey in New Zealand is derived from plants of the _Coriaria_ spp (commonly called tutu). "Both tutin and hyenachin, a hydroxytutin have been isolated from poisonous honey; the latter is not present in tutu but in the honeydew on the tutu leaves. The honeydew is excreted on to the tutu leaves by the naturalized passion vine hopper, _Scolypopa australis_. Bees feed on the latter when normal nectar sources are scarce." Veterinary Clinical Toxicology 3rd ed. 2006. p344. Parton K, Bruere AN, Chambers JP.

There are restrictions on harvesting honey from areas with large numbers of tutu plants during the at risk periods.
