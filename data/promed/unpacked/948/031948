[The total number of monkeypox cases continues to increase each day. A 6 Jul 2022 report indicated that WHO will reconvene a meeting of the committee that will advise on declaring the outbreak a global health emergency, the WHO's highest level of alert, in the week beginning 18 Jul 2022 or sooner, Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a virtual news conference from Geneva (https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/who-more-than-6000-monkeypox-cases-reported-another-emergency-meeting-set-2022-07-06/).

A 6 Jul 2022 WHO External Situation Report 1 (with data as received by WHO national authorities by 17:00 CEST, 4 Jul 2022) stated that since the previous Disease Outbreak News was published on 27 Jun 2022, 2614 new cases (77% increase) and 2 new deaths have been reported; 9 new countries/territories/areas have reported cases. There are 10 countries that have not reported new cases for over 21 days, the maximum duration of the incubation period of the disease. This is the 1st time that local transmission of monkeypox has been reported in newly affected countries without epidemiological links to countries that have previously reported monkeypox in West or Central Africa (https://bit.ly/3Awzt6p).

There is a graph of the cumulative number of monkeypox cases as of 6 Jul 2022, available at https://bit.ly/3yo1dHH. - Mod.TY]
