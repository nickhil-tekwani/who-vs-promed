The confirmation of a death due to [a] hantavirus [infection] and the report of another suspected case has caused the authorities in the Los Alerces National Park to increase protective measures, prohibiting overnight stays in tents, bivouacs, domes, campers, and recreational vehicles.

These new measures add to others taken last week, when campgrounds were ordered vacated due to proliferation of the pygmy long-tailed rat, known scientifically as _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_, whose population is on the rise since last month [December 2013].

This is a typical phenomenon during this season related to the flowering of colihue cane, a bushy grass, bamboo subspecies, which is native to the mountain area and is the preferred food source of the rodents, which increase their reproductive activity causing a "rat [population] eruption."

"This phenomenon has a history from 1940," as stated in a published study by Cecilia Nunez, Solidad Caracotche, and Anhi Perez of the Patagonia Regional Delegation of the National Parks Administration.

The increase in the rodent population expands [the occurrence of] this acute viral infection known as "hantavirus" [pulmonary syndrome], transmitted to people via the oral [respiratory] route through saliva, urine, and feces, in this case when a person unknowingly breathes in [virus contaminated] dust carrying dried excrement.

In the middle of this month [January 2014], it was confirmed that a 29-year-old man died in the Puerto Madryn Hospital due to [a] hantavirus [infection]. The previous weekend, he had been in the "Bahia Rosales" campground by the Los Alerces lake area, which caused the Secretary of Health to issue an alert. "We proceeded with a health protocol applicable to these positive hantavirus [infection] cases," it was stated in a communication signed by the Subsecretary of Institutional Management, Eduardo Wasserman, and the Director of Esquel Program Area, Veronica Lloyd.

Added to the fatal case in Puerto Madryn is a another patient with a suspected clinical picture interned in Comodoro Rivadavia, who presented with symptoms compatible with [a] hantavirus [infection].

The associate director of the regional hospital, Raul Soria, reported that "there have been lab tests done urgently to send samples to Malbran [Malbran National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Buenos Aires, the national reference laboratory].

This latter case is a 60-year-old man who was camping in a forested area in Arrayanes.

To this health picture is added "a behavioral change in the activity of the rodents, which have increased their daytime activity, so current [preventive] measures have been increased and arranged so that the campgrounds will be used only in the daytime." Since yesterday [27 Jan 2014], "all the trails have been closed with the exception of Rupestres, Puerto Limonao, Laguna Larga, Cascada Irigoyen, sendero Interpretativo, Represa Futaleufu, and Cascada Los Tambores," the communication stated.

"Because of ongoing concern about visitors, the Administration of National Parks will continue to carry out control and surveillance, applying safety protocols according to authorities of the Ministry of Health of Chubut," according to the text of the announcement.

[It is not clear whether the fatal case above is the same one reported on 18 Jan 2014 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20140121.2220063), in which the infection was acquired in the Los Alerces National Park.

Although the specific hantavirus involved in this and the previous case of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in this region is not specified, it most likely is Andes virus. Andes virus is the only hantavirus shown thus far to be transmitted directly from person to person, but only rarely, and among individuals in very close contact. Most infections are acquired from contact with excrement of infected rodents. Andes virus occurs in western Argentina, harbored by the long-tailed pygmy rice rat reservoir host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_. Populations of these rodents can increase significantly with the flowering and setting of seed of the Colihue cane, a food source for these Andes virus rodent reservoirs. The health authorities have rapidly implemented protocols in response to the occurrence of this case.
