While much of the national media attention has been on the center of the West Nile [virus] outbreak in Texas, for good reason, Louisiana has also been seeing large increases in the mosquito-borne virus [infections in humans] from week to week.

The Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals (DHH) reported 53 new human cases of West Nile virus (WNV) [infection] this week [week of 20 Aug 2012], approximately one-third of the total cases seen so far this year according to a Friday [24 Aug 2012] news release. This brings the total number of cases to 145. This is the highest number of cases seen in the state in the past several years. In addition, the DHH reported 3 more deaths from WNV, bringing the total fatalities this year to 9.

The large increases of WNV in the state and nationwide, has prompted DHH health officials to hold a press conference earlier to emphasize to the public the personal responsibility in protecting yourself and your family from this preventable disease.

DHH Office of Public Health Assistant Secretary JT Lane said, "This is an easy illness to avoid -- if you know you'll be outside, take a few minutes to apply repellant. We want people to be especially mindful of this because we are just getting to the time of year when people are spending more time outside tailgating, going to football games, and having cookouts. Be aware of West Nile [virus mosquito vectors], and do what you need to do to protect yourself."

Of the 53 new cases reported this week, 31 were of the more serious neuroinvasive type.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 80 per cent of people (about 4 out of 5) who are infected with WNV will not show any symptoms at all. Up to 20 per cent of the people who become infected have symptoms such as fever, headache, and body aches, nausea, vomiting, and sometimes swollen lymph glands or a skin rash on the chest, stomach, and back. Symptoms can last for as short as a few days, though even [otherwise] healthy people have become sick for several weeks.

The severe symptoms can include high fever, headache, neck stiffness, stupor, disorientation, coma, tremors, convulsions, muscle weakness, vision loss, numbness, and paralysis. These symptoms may last several weeks, and neurological effects may be permanent.

There is no specific treatment for WNV infection.

According to the DHH, the most active year for West Nile cases in Louisiana was 2002, when the state experienced 328 cases and 24 deaths.

Health officials in the Bayou State remind residents "Fight the Bite" [by taking measures to avoid mosquito bites]:
In addition, another effective way to prevent mosquito bites is to drain stagnant water from around homes and property to prevent mosquitoes from breeding and swarming.

[This report underscores the fact that there are several geographic clusters of human WNV cases in the USA over the past 2 months. The Louisiana cluster is a significant one. As the report points out, if the public does not heed advice to prevent mosquito bites and reduce vector mosquito breeding sites, more cases and perhaps additional deaths will continue until killing frosts occur in autumn.

[Re: ProMED-mail West Nile virus - USA (09) human, comment 20120825.1263077]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr Hollinger's insight is invaluable and should be carefully considered by those currently doing battle with West Nile virus (WNV), eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV), and several other mosquito-borne viruses. As he mentioned, birds maintain a viremia sufficient to infect mosquitoes for just 3 or so days. A single adulticide application, even if impressively efficacious (with a reduction in vector abundance of about 90 per cent), may immediately reduce (but not eliminate) transmission from mosquitoes to new hosts. This is a positive outcome. The older adults that remain on the wing, however, continue to pose a risk (albeit at a reduced level) of transmission to reservoir hosts as well as to people and other dead end hosts.

Even more problematic, if adult mosquitoes continue to eclose (emerge) daily, then these adults have several days of opportunity to acquire virus and to perpetuate transmission. But, most adulticide-based interventions are scripted to occur as a single application. This may be defined by EPA restrictions, or -- more often -- by political desire or because of limited financial resources.

What is important to consider is the point I believe Dr Hollinger meant to highlight. Because birds may remain viremic for several days, widespread adulticide-based efforts to reduce risk might be far more efficacious if they are repeatedly delivered during several subsequent days (or nights). Spraying just once is often perceived as demonstrating a forceful response to a problem. It may be, however, that this is akin to administering a single dose of antibiotic when a longer course is indicated.

[This comment, and the previous ones concerning vector control, underscore the need for ongoing surveillance to determine vector mosquito abundance before and after adulticide application and the need for assessmant of the WNV field infection rates of the mosquitoes. - Mod.TY]
