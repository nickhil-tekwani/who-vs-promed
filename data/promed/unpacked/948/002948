Outbreaks of viral meningitis continue here in Washoe County [Nevada] and in Susanville [Lassen County, California]. In Susanville where the outbreak was initially traced to the high school football team and forced the temporary closure of the school as well as the Community College, public health officials say they've had 50 possible cases reported. Of those 22 are suspected and 18 are clinically diagnosed; 16 of which are lab confirmed. Another 10 have been ruled out. Here in Washoe County the count is now 36 cases.

Viral meningitis can be caused by a number of different viruses. In this case, there's initial evidence the outbreak is being caused by one particular enterovirus known as ECHO virus 30. "We've got some evidence suggesting eco30 here," says Washoe County Epidemiologist Dr. Randall Todd. "They've got lab evidence suggesting ECHO 30 there. What we want to know is at the molecular level is this the same virus." That would be a first step toward finding a common source for the outbreaks. "It's more likely if they are the same molecularly there is a common source."

Unlike the Lassen County outbreak there appears to be no geographic hot spot here. No school, for instance, with a number of cases.

Large percentages however, are children. "As many as 72 percent of the cases were in children," says Dr. Todd. "With 53 percent being children that are considered school age, between the ages of 5 and 17; and 67 percent of our cases were male."

Those numbers are fairly typical of an outbreak of viral meningitis, an inflammation of the tissues surrounding the brain and the spinal cord. Viral meningitis is less serious than bacterial meningitis. There's no treatment other than for symptoms which include a fever and headaches.

The advice for avoiding it remains the same. Don't share anything you're going to put in your mouth--a particular note of caution with Halloween and the other holidays coming up. Wash your hands often; keep common surfaces clean and; if you don't feel right see a doctor; don't spread it.

[It would not be surprising if the agent or agents causing these clusters are the same. The areas are only about 100 miles [approx. 161 km] away as the crow flies.

The non-polio enteroviruses are the most common causes of viral meningitis, especially during the summer and fall months. Most people who get infected with enteroviruses are asymptomatic or have only a non-specific febrile illness. Enteroviruses are most often spread via the fecal-oral route from person to person, through fecal contamination of water or food, or contact with contaminated inanimate objects.

The ECHO viruses (enteric cytopathic human orphan) viruses are part of the enterovirus species in the picornavirus family. Type 30 has certainly been reported to cause outbreaks of viral meningitis. An example is Faustino A, Fano V, Muscillo M, et al: An outbreak of aseptic meningitis due to echovirus 30 associated with attending school and swimming in pools. Int J Infect Dis. 2006;10: 291-7; available at:
http://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(05)00203-1/pdf.

No available specific therapy for ECHO viruses has existed, however, pleconaril, a first-of-its-kind viral capsid-inhibitor compound -- an experimental agent with in vitro activity against most enteroviruses --, appears to have efficacy with a good safety profile. It does not appear that it has received FDA approval in the USA. - Mod.LL
