Exotic grape disease discovered in Australia
----------------------------------------------
Authorities say an exotic grape vine disease found in Darwin will be
treated as if it could threaten Australia's major vineyard areas. The leaf
rust has been detected in a suburban backyard, with anecdotal reports it
has also been found in other backyard vines.
A national phone hook-up [was] held...to investigate the problem, involving
Primary Industries Departments from all states. Australia's chief plant
protection officer, Dr Bill Roberts, says at this stage the disease is
being treated as if it could spread.

[The following is an edited response from Bill Roberts, Chief Plant
Protection Officer, Australia.
The rust detected is _Phakopsora euvitis_...The species [in Australia]...is
tropical and restricted to grapevines. To date we have found 10 rusted
vines out of 17 checked but are continuing to check. Grapes are not a
[major crop] in Darwin. Currently we are removing all diseased vines and
are looking at the possibility of removal of all grape vines in Darwin.
We are also checking other tropical areas in Australia.
The disease is widespread throughout the tropics including Indonesia and
Timor...entry could have been by windborne spread or possibly accidently by
contamination on clothes or other objects. Fruit does not [become] infected
and is not a pathway for spread [of the disease].
Further information about the disease can be obtained from:
