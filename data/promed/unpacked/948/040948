Last occurrence: 26 Jul 2021
Causal agent: Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus [HPAI]
Serotype: H5N1

This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

Outbreak location: Wychavon, Worcestershire, England
Started: 15 Oct 2021
Epidemiological unit: Other
Animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Birds / 49 / 39 / 25 / 24 / - / -
Affected population: Rescued wild swans (adults and young), rescued and captive geese, ducks and chickens.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: On [24 Oct 2021] a Wild Bird Rescue Centre reported suspicion of notifiable avian disease in mute swans (_Cygnus olor_) and chickens kept at the premises. From [16 Oct 2021], at least 11 young swans and 14 (out of 17) chickens had died. There were 33 young and adult swans with clinical signs, of which 6 of the adults had neurological signs. Official samples were collected at the official veterinary visit and submitted for testing to APHA Weybridge. On [25 Oct 2021], Avian Influenza M gene, H5 and N1 viral antigens were detected in all but one of the samples submitted, including tissue post mortem samples. No antibodies to AI were detected. The clinical picture continued to deteriorate with more bird deaths. As of [26 Oct 2021], all birds at the affected Wild Bird Rescue Centre have been culled and sampling taken for the epidemiological enquiry. Preliminary cleaning and disinfection completed on [27 Oct 2021]. A full epidemiological investigation is being carried out. Official zoning has been implemented around the affected site (comprising a 3 km [1.9 mi] Protection Zone and a 10 km [6.2 mi] Surveillance Zone), which have been temporarily implemented as a precautionary measure. This notification describes an event of HPAI in captive birds other than poultry. Therefore, and in accordance with Article 10.4.1 (4) of Chapter 10.4 of the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code: - This event does not affect the UK's HPAI freedom status; and -Trading partners should not impose bans on the international trade of poultry commodities in response to this notification.

Control measures at event level
Wild control measures applied: control of wildlife reservoirs, official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste.

[The following information comes from the Rapid Risk Assessment on HPAIV H5 in Germany on 26 Oct 2021, available at https://www.openagrar.de/servlets/MCRFileNodeServlet/openagrar_derivate_00042585/FLI-Risikoeinschaetzung_HPAIV_H5_2021-10-26_bf.pdf in German.

Between October 2020 and April 2021, Germany and Europe in general experienced the most severe avian influenza epizootic to date. Despite a significant decrease in both cases and outbreaks during the spring of 2021, HPAIV H5 was detected in waterfowl and birds of prey over the summer, especially in the Nordic countries of Europe. In Germany, since mid-October 2021, there has been an increasing number of detections of HPAIV-infected wild birds in Schleswig-Holstein, Lower Saxony, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Bavaria as well as first occurrences in poultry and kept birds. The risk of HPAIV H5 spreading in wild birds and transmission to poultry and kept birds in Germany is classified as high. It is strongly recommended that biosecurity measures in poultry holdings be reviewed and, if necessary, strengthened.

A map of HPAI detections in Germany during the period of 1 Oct 2020 to 28 Oct 2021 can be seen at https://www.fli.de/fileadmin/FLI/Images/Tierseuchengeschehen/H5N8/Karten_D/2021/Map_AI_D_2021-10-28.jpg

A map of HPAI detection in Europe during 1 Oct 2020 to 28 Oct 2021 is available at https://www.fli.de/fileadmin/FLI/Images/Tierseuchengeschehen/H5N8/Karten_EU/2021/Map_AI_EU_2021-10-28.jpg

Regarding the outbreak in UK, a press release published on 26 Oct 2021 (https://www.gov.uk/government/news/avian-influenza-bird-flu-identified-at-a-wildbird-rescue-centre-in-worcestershire) from Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs, Food Standards Agency, mentioned that: "The UK Chief Veterinary Officer has confirmed a case of avian influenza (bird flu) at a wild bird rescue center in Worcestershire today.

"Wild birds migrating to the UK from mainland Europe during the winter months can carry the disease and this can lead to cases in poultry and other captive birds.

"All birds on site will be humanely culled. A 3 km [1.9 mi] and 10 km [6.2 mi] temporary control zone has also been put in place around the infected premises to limit the risk of the disease spreading.

"UK Health Security Agency advises that the risk to public health from the virus is very low and the Food Standards Agency has made clear that bird flu poses a very low food safety risk for UK consumers. The premises does not supply poultry, meat or eggs to the commercial food chain". - Mod CRD]
