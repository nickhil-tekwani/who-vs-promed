[This canine rabies case is not surprising, following the return of rabies to wildlife in Greece after 25 years of absence (see ProMED-mail post 20121020.1354720).

Vaccination of pets, at least in zones adjacent to Greece's northern neighbours Albania and Macedonia where the rabies situation is of concern, may deserve consideration.

For updated data on the rabies situation in Europe, see http://rbe.fli.bund.de/Default.aspx.
