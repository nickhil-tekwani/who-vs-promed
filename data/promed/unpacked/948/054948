Whales found dead on Donegal beach
----------------------------------
Scientists have taken skin and tissue samples from the 33 pilot whales
which died off the coast of County Donegal. Environmentalists are trying to
establish how the whales beached on Rutland Island near Burtonport. It is
thought that they were the same group spotted in the Outer Hebrides
[Scotland] at the end of October [2010].

Dr Simon Berrow of the Irish Whale and Dolphin Group said it was one of the
biggest mass deaths of whales in Irish history. He is concerned that Royal
Navy sonar equipment could have played a role. "30 or 40 pilot whales were
spotted off the Outer Hebrides at South Uist last week," he said. "It
looked like they were going to strand. It was bad weather. They were not
seen again."

[A previous event of undiagnosed death of whales stranding on Irish beaches
was reported by ProMED-mail in April 2008; it involved pilot whales
(_Globicephala melas_), Cuvier's beaked whales (_Ziphius cavirostris_), and
Sowerby's beaked whales (_Mesoplodon bidens_). See archived 20080502.1512
with the commentary by Mod.JW.

Results of laboratory investigations will be appreciated; it may be assumed
that these will include virological examinations to exclude _Morbillivirus_
involvement. - Mod.AS
