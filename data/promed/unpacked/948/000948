Health & Science: Poisonous plant prompts FDA warning
----------------------------------------------------
The US Food and Drug Administration is warning people to stay clear of
a poisonous plant mistakenly labeled as "tasty."
The plant, known as Autumn Monkshood, remains poisonous even after
it's cooked. Valleybrook Gardens Ltd., a Canadian nursery, distributed
the plant -- labeled as being "tasty in soup" -- to nurseries in
Washington state & Idaho (USA) and British Columbia (Canada).
Poisoning could cause irregular heartbeat or direct paralysis, leading
to death, the FDA and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency said
Thursday. Other symptoms include tingling limbs, burning or tingling
mouth or tongue, muscle weakness and stomach problems. Anyone who eats
the plant should go to a doctor immediately.
The plants, which have tall violet-blue flowers, were packaged in blue
plastic pots and distributed starting in early March [2001]. The
agencies think about 1500 already have been sold. There are no known
illnesses or injuries [reported at present].
People with concerns may call Valleybrook Gardens at 1-604-855-1177 or
the Canadian Food Inspection Agency at 1-613-225-2342.
