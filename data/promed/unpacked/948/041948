At noon this Saturday [17 Dec 2011], a 24-year-old young man who was
hospitalized in the Base Hospital of Osorno was released after
contracting [a] hantavirus [infection] in the Futalelfu area. This
worker in Customs, who contracted the disease after sport fishing in
this area, is now in stable condition resting at his home located in
Osorno.

However, the 53-year-old mother of the man stated that she had similar
symptoms, which caused her to go to Sapu Pedro Jauregui, located in
Rahue Bajo [to seek medical attention], where she did not receive the
attention that she hoped for, which caused her to call the authorities
to better monitor [patient] care. The First Care Providers in the
Emergency unit stated that the woman was attended to by professionals,
according to her symptoms. This was stated by Astrid Haunstein, Head
Nurse, who provided assurance that it was impossible that any employee
had been watching soap operas on television, since this type of
Internet service is blocked.

Finally, she recommended that the woman remain calm, since the
hantavirus cannot be transmitted from person to person, rather [is
transmitted] by breathing contaminated air. [This is not correct. The
virus most likely involved in the young man's case and perhaps his
mother's, is Andes virus, which can be transmitted to a susceptible
person by an infected individual with whom the person is in very close
contact, usually family members of the same household. - Mod.TY]

[The young man probably had been in areas where the long-tailed pygmy
rice rat occurs. The excrement, urine and saliva can contain the virus
shed by this infected reservoir host rodent. The risk of exposure to
the virus is greatest in rodent-infested buildings, especially those
that have been closed for some time. However, the above report makes
no mention of the possible circumstances of infection, nor if an
epidemiological field study was carried out as followup to this case.
It would be of interest to know if any laboratory tests were done on
samples from the mother, to confirm or rule out a hantavirus infection
in her case. It is curious that the head nurse indicated that the
virus was not transmissible from person to person, since there are
ample reports in the published literature that this does occur with
Andes virus in Chile, and the medical community there is mostly well
aware of it.

longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can
