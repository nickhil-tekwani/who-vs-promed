The public is urged to protect against mosquito bites after a horse in Bay County was confirmed to have a mosquito-transmitted disease, the Bay County health department reported.

On 7 Nov 2013, a Bay County horse was found to be infected with eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), a rare disease caused by a virus which can cause inflammation of the brain. The virus can be spread to humans by mosquitoes. It is the 2nd case reported in the county since 1 Jan 2013, the release stated.

EEE is one of the most severe mosquito-transmitted diseases in the nation, with a 33 per cent mortality rate and significant brain damage in most EEE survivors. However, only 5 to 10 cases of EEE are reported annually in the US, according to [human] health officials.

Symptoms of the virus [in humans - Mod.TG] may include fever, headache, fatigue, dizziness, and confusion. A person who suspects they've been infected with the EEE virus should see a doctor as soon as possible. The Health Department provides testing services for health care providers treating patients with symptoms of mosquito-borne disease, the release stated.

[While it is not unusual for warm weather and mosquito season to continue into November and sometimes December along the US Deep South and coastal water ways, it is highly unusual that this county says it is only the 2nd case of EEE in 2013. There have been counties all around this area reporting the disease. So if this is only the 2nd case they must be getting the word out to vaccinate the horses and remove standing water, which is a breeding location for mosquitoes.

Sadly, however, this is not a rare disease in horses in the US. The disease is transmitted by mosquitoes to both humans and to horses. There is a very effective vaccine for horses as well as mosquito sprays. There is not a vaccine for humans and prevention is the best means of protection for both horses and humans.
