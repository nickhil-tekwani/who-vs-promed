North Dakota has its 8th-ever confirmed case of hantavirus infection, and
the first in 6 years. The case was diagnosed in a woman in Grand Forks, who
is recovering.
Hantavirus is a severe respiratory infection spread by rodents. It causes
such flu-like symptoms as fever, shortness of breath, chills, nausea,
headache, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. State Health Department disease
specialist Kirby Kruger says the 1st cases of hantavirus in North Dakota
were diagnosed in 1993. Officials later determined there had been cases
dating back to the late 1970s. 2 cases were reported in 2000.
Kruger says the best way to combat the disease is to treat all rodents as
if they had hantavirus -- and get rid of them.

[4 species of hantavirus are known to cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome
(HPS) in the United States: _Sin Nombre virus_, _Bayou virus_, _New York
virus_, and _Black Creek Canal virus. See:
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/hanta/hps/noframes/epislides/episl1.htm>.
In North Dakota the etiologic agent is likely to be _Sin Nombre virus_. As
of 6 Jul 2005 there had been a total of 396 cases of HPS in the United
States, only 7 of which had occurred in North Dakota. Thus the case
described in the preceding report is the 8th case in the state of North
Dakota. As of 6 Jul 2005, New Mexico topped the list with 64 cases, and
North Dakota now ranks as 11th in frequency of disease. - Mod.CP]
