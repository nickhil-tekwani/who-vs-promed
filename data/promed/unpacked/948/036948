Low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) typically causes only minor illness, poses no risk to human health, and often causes no clinical signs. However, some LPAI viruses, particularly the H5 and H7 subtypes, are capable of mutating into HPAI viruses http://www.aphis.usda.gov/newsroom/hot_issues/avian_influenza/avian_influenza.shtml. - Mod.CRD
