The head of Epidemiology of the departmental [state of province equivalent] Health Services (SEDES), Wilfredo Camargo, stated on Thursday [26 Jan 2012] that so far this January the cases of hemorrhagic fever have increased in Mamore and Itenez provinces in Beni.

He indicated that a patient contracted the disease [virus infection] on the Penas Verdes ranch in Mamore province and died in Cochabamba, after which laboratory tests confirmed that he was infected with Machupo virus that is transmitted by _Calomys callosus_ mice.

He stated that in the same ranch, the daughter of a domestic employee currently has symptoms compatible with the disease and is interned in the hospital in Magdalena, with bloody vomit.

Camargo expressed his concern because in recent hours 6 suspected cases of hemorrhagic fever have been reported in Mamore and Itenez provinces, of whom 3 are hospitalized in San Ramon and one in Magdalena.

With this, he stated that he and technicians will go to these provinces in coming hours in the active search for rodents, prevention and control of the current outbreak.

He explained that the treatment of the ill individuals consists of hydration with sera of convalescent people, that is to say [serum from] a person who contracted the disease [infection] but survived, which serves as a vaccine [source of antibodies for passive immunity].

[This appears to be a continuation of the outbreak in Beni department that began at the end of November last year (2011)(see ProMED-mail archive no. 20111202.3514). Beni department is endemic for Machupo virus, the etiological agent of Bolivian hemorrhagic fever. Symptoms and epidemiology of Bolivian hemorrhagic fever are presented in ProMED-mail archive no. 20000416.0545. The large vesper mouse can be persistently infected with Machupo virus, a situation common among arenaviruses and their rodent hosts.
