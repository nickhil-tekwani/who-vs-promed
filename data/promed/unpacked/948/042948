Health officials say 5 more dogs have tested positive for a strain of canine influenza in southwestern Ontario, bringing the total number of infected up to 7 in what they're calling the virus's 1st known incursion into the country.

The Windsor-Essex County Health Unit says the 2 dogs that initially tested positive for H3N2 canine flu were brought to Canada from South Korea through the United States late last month [December 2017].

It says the 7 dogs that most recently tested positive for the virus were in "close contact" with the 1st 2. Officials say the affected dogs -- and others that were in contact with them -- are being confined by their owners.

Health officials say the H3N2 canine influenza virus is highly transmissible between dogs and has become widespread in parts of Asia and caused outbreaks in some U.S. locations, particularly in shelters. They say there is no known human risk from the virus but note that the risk that it might mix with human seasonal influenza viruses is "a potential concern."

[To date there is zero documented evidence thus far of the "canine" flu strains moving from dogs to people. There is ample evidence of multiple human flu strains including H5N1 and the H1N1 09 pandemic strain infecting dogs and cats. That being said there is clearly a risk of any Influenza A strain developing the ability to move between species at any time, but with both H3N8 and H3N2 in dogs, that ability to cross back into people hasn't happened yet. The official situation is: the CDC's statement is https://www.cdc.gov/flu/canineflu/keyfacts.htm and the AVMA's is https://www.avma.org/KB/Resources/Reference/Pages/Canine-Influenza-Backgrounder.aspx. So be cautious when handling 'flu infected dogs and wash your hands after handling your dogs. Fingers find their way up noses. - Mod.MHJ
