I suspect that I have found, southeast of Baghdad on 20 Jun 2013, a clinical case in a calf, which showed signs typically similar to lumpy skin disease [LSD]. The case was seen in my private veterinary clinic.

Some additional information:
Start date: 7 Jun 2013 [see further below]
Manifestation of disease: Clinical case
The age of calf: 1.5 years. Nodules appeared on the neck, chest and thigh. The size of the nodules was from 2.0 to 9.0 mm. Erosions/nodules were seen also in the mouth and on the muzzle. Temperature was elevated (41.5 C [106.7 F]). There was blackish diarrhea.

Outbreak Location: Gorif-Al Nadaf, near Al-Uraifia Veterinary Hospital. Owner was a breeder/butcher [name withheld].

Total animals affected: Susceptible (8), Cases (2), Deaths (0), Destroyed (0), Slaughtered (1).

The animal was bought on 7 Jun 2013 from an animal market east of Baghdad. I suspect that the disease came through illegal entry and smuggling of animals.

[We are grateful to Dr Abbas for providing the above information about a suspected LSD case.

The described signs may be indicative of LSD, though 2 of them deviate from the expected: LSD nodules are expected to be larger (typically, 1-7 cm) than the described; diarrhea is not common. This does not exclude LSD; the clinical suspicion deserves a thorough epidemiological investigation by the Veterinary Services, including serological tests (according to the information, one affected animal may have survived?).

Since mid-2012, LSD has been reported from Israel, Lebanon, the Palestinian authority, and Jordan (which borders Iraq). The disease is known to be endemic in Egypt. It will be surprising if this arthropod-borne virus is not circulating also in other countries in the region, particularly Syria. - Mod.AS
