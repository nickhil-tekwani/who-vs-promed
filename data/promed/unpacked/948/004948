Health Department officials in Kollam on Thursday [2 Aug 2007] said
that 15 people were found with symptoms of chikungunya at
Pathanapuram, Palathara and Karunagapally in the district. Meanwhile,
1194 people came to various hospitals seeking medical assistance for
viral fever. At a medical camp held at Thrikkadavur, 280 people
sought medical care.
DMO Elizabeth John Zakharia said medical teams had visited 4696
houses and conducted source reduction activities at 3761 places as
part of the anti-mosquito drive. Chlorination was held in 1130 wells.

ProMED Rapporteur Brent Barrett
[The occurrence of febrile disease continues in Kerala. The
proportion of febrile cases due to chikungunya virus infection
remains unclear. As noted in previous ProMED posts, confirmed
laboratory diagnosis is critical to know to what extent chikungunya
virus infection is responsible for these cases, in order to mount an
effective control campaign. The anti-mosquito vector activities noted
in this report indicate that the health authorities believe a
significant number of these febrile cases are due to chikungunya
virus infection.
