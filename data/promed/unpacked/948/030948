West Nile virus illnesses in Texas continue to rise dramatically, state health officials said Tuesday [4 Sep 2012], with the number of cases this summer rising to 1013 -- with 40 deaths -- as an Austin man became the 2nd in Travis County to die from the mosquito-borne disease [virus].

A little less than 2 weeks ago, there were 640 cases and 23 confirmed deaths statewide. That is a 58 percent increase in cases and 74 percent increase in deaths. State officials warned that the infections may continue until the 1st hard freeze of the year.

"The peak for West Nile season is August, and then there is a delay before it gets reported to us. We are expecting the numbers to keep increasing," said Christine Mann, a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of State Health Services. The agency's count does not include the new Travis County death, which had not yet been reported to the state. As of Tuesday [4 Sep 2012], there have been 48 confirmed cases of West Nile in Travis county, up from 23 cases and one death on 22 Aug [2012].

Health authorities have said that this year [2012] is the worst since West Nile 1st appeared in the U.S. in 1999 and in Texas in 2002. Health officials attribute the spread of the disease to a mild winter followed by late spring rains and a hot summer. A total of 1590 cases of West Nile, including 65 deaths, have been reported nationwide. The 1st death of a Travis County resident was reported on 1 Aug [2012]. Williamson County has had 11 cases and one death, Hays [county] 4 cases and no deaths, and Bastrop County 2 cases and no deaths.

Austin/Travis County Health and Human Services Director Carlos Rivera on Tuesday [4 Sep 2012] confirmed the county's 2nd death from West Nile neuro-invasive disease, the more serious form of the virus. Officials did not release the victim's name, saying only that the person was among those at the highest risk of severe illness: older than 50.

Oklahoma has reached 118 confirmed West Nile virus cases this year [2012], the highest number of cases recorded in the state in a single year, state Health Department officials said. Officials say this year's outbreak could rival those of 2002 and 2003.

The Health Department also reported Tuesday [4 Sep 2012] that 2 more residents have died from West Nile virus-related illness. So far, 7 residents have died because of the virus [infection]. One of the deaths, a man between the ages of 40-50 in Tulsa County, marks the youngest person reported dead from the virus. The other person who died was a woman in Tulsa County who was between the ages of 70-80.

West Nile virus is cyclical, peaking every 3-4 years. In 2007, Oklahoma saw 107 confirmed cases of West Nile virus and 9 deaths.

Oklahoma is not alone in high cases of West Nile virus. There have been 1590 cases reported nationwide. It is the highest number the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has seen through the last week in August since the virus entered the U.S. in 1999.

West Nile virus is generally contracted through the bite of a virus-infected mosquito. Public health officials recommend that residents use mosquito repellent with DEET and remove standing water from their homes.

[Human cases of West Nile virus infection continue to mount, particularly in the south-central USA. These cases will likely continue to increase until the transmission season ends when killing frosts occur in autumn. Until then, people in this epidemic area should follow the instructions of health departments to avoid mosquito bites. Aerial spraying has been done in the Dallas area to control mosquito vectors. There is no mention of spraying in the above reports from Texas and Oklahoma.
