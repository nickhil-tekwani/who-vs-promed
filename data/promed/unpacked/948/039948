A 47 year old woman died in the Rafael Estevez Hospital in Aguadulce, presumed to be due to a case of hantavirus [infection]. The suspicion [of a hantavirus infection] resulted from the woman's symptoms [presumably hantavirus pulmonary syndrome-like] and from the conditions found in her house in Nata and vicinity that are propitious for the presence of rodents and other insects [insects are not involved in hantavirus transmission. - Mod.TY]

The Cocle regional Health Office has not confirmed the case [as a hantavirus infection], so it is considered suspicious until the laboratory tests are concluded.

However, at the beginning of this year [2013] a confirmed case of hantavirus [infection] was reported, but the 39 year old patient did not die.

The Health Office continues with cleanup operations in Nata and Aguadulce and with fumigation to avoid hantavirus and dengue cases in the region.

[There have been several cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in Panama so far this year (2013; see archives below). Although the hantavirus involved in this case is not specified, the one most likely responsible for this case and the previous one is Choclo virus, as mentioned in ProMED-mail archive no. 20130204.1527935. Of the 3 hantaviruses known to occur in Panama, only Choclo is a known human pathogen, causing hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, which can have a high case fatality rate, especially when victims come to hospital late in the course of their disease.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg.
