Horse Influenza Found In Eastern Oregon
---------------------------------------
A horse from Eastern Oregon that was referred to Oregon State University's (OSU) veterinary teaching hospital because of illness has been diagnosed with equine influenza virus, a highly contagious respiratory disease in horses that typically is not fatal.

The 4-year-old quarter horse mare, which recently arrived in Oregon from Texas, has been placed in isolation and is being treated.

OSU veterinary clinicians say equine influenza is not transferable to humans or other animal species, but can spread rapidly among horses and other equines. It is the most common contagious respiratory pathogen for horses and most animals fully recover. However, young, elderly or pregnant animals are more at-risk for viral diseases such as equine influenza.

"Equine influenza is especially dangerous to foals and the foaling season just started," said Keith Poulsen, an internal medicine specialist at the Lois Bate Acheson Veterinary Hospital in OSU's College of Veterinary Medicine. "The virus can be spread by direct contact with nasal discharge, or when aerosolized from coughing."

The Large Animal Internal Medicine and Surgery Services program at OSU's college of Veterinary Medicine is working with the state veterinarian's office to inform veterinarians and horse owners about the disease.

Poulsen said the 1st clinical sign in horses is typically a fever, followed by cough, nasal discharge and lethargy. Horses with a fever of greater than 102.5 degrees should be seen by a veterinarian. Horse owners should also consult with their veterinarian about vaccinations, he added.

Infected horses can "shed" or transmit the virus for up to 10 days after incubation. Horses that show signs of the disease should be isolated from other horses for 10 days after clinical signs first appear.

"The good news is that many disinfectants can easily kill the equine influenza virus, and thoroughly cleaning stalls and equipment can help prevent the virus from spreading," Poulsen said.

The Eastern Oregon horse was purchased at a sale in Hermiston last weekend and several horses that were in close contact with it also have developed signs of illness, though they have not yet been diagnosed with equine influenza virus, officials say.

The horse will remain at OSU in isolation until it fully recovers. As an added precaution, the OSU hospital is only accepting equine patients requiring emergency treatment until Wed 27 Feb 2013. Horses being referred for elective surgery, lameness or non-emergency conditions will be delayed until after Wednesday.

"The college has some of the most sophisticated isolation facilities of any facility in the country," noted Helio de Morais, interim director of the Lois Bates Acheson Veterinary Hospital. "Safely treating animals such as these -- and working with veterinarians and animal owners around the state to prevent the spread of these diseases -- is what we do best."

Equine influenza is highly contagious and spreads rapidly among susceptible horses. 2 immunologically distinct influenza viruses have been found in horse populations worldwide except in Australia and New Zealand. Orthomyxovirus (influenza) A/Equi-1 has not been isolated since 1980. Orthomyxovirus (influenza) A/Equi-2 was 1st recognized in 1963 as a cause of widespread epidemics and has subsequently become endemic in many countries. Endemicity is maintained by sporadic clinical cases and by inapparent infection in susceptible horses that are introduced into the population by birth, through waning immunity, or after movement from other areas or countries. A carrier state is not recognized for equine influenza. The clinical outcome after viral exposure largely depends on immune status; clinical disease varies from a mild, inapparent infection to severe disease in susceptible animals. Influenza is rarely fatal except in donkeys, zebras, and debilitated horses. Transmission occurs by inhalation of respiratory secretions. Epidemics arise when one or more acutely infected horses are introduced into a susceptible group. The epidemiologic outcome depends on the antigenic characteristics of the circulating virus and the immune status of a given population of horses at time of exposure. Frequent natural exposure or regular vaccination may contribute to the degree of antigenic drift observed with specific strains of A/Equi-2 virus in some parts of the world.

The incubation period of influenza is about 1-3 days. Clinical signs begin abruptly and include high fever (up to 106F [41.1C]), serous nasal discharge, submandibular lymphadenopathy, and coughing that is dry, harsh, and nonproductive. Depression, anorexia, and weakness are frequently observed. Clinical signs usually last slightly less than 3 days in uncomplicated cases. Influenza virus replicates within respiratory epithelial cells, resulting in destruction of tracheal and bronchial epithelium and cilia. Young horses seem to be the most susceptible. All ages of horses with mild infection may take 2-3 weeks to recover. Those that are severely affected may take 6 months to recover. Along the road to recovery these horses are subject to bacterial infection, especially pneumonia and bronchitis.

The presence of a rapidly spread respiratory infection in a group of horses characterized by rapid onset, high fever, depression, and cough is presumptive evidence of equine influenza. Definitive diagnosis can be determined by virus isolation, influenza A antigen detection, or paired serology (hemagglutination inhibition). Nasopharyngeal swabs are obtained for virus isolation and antigen detection. Samples need to be taken as early as the clinical signs are recognized.

Antibiotics are recommended if the fever persists longer than 3 days or if purulent nasal discharge is present. Horses should be rested one week for every day of fever with a minimum of 3 week rest (to allow regeneration of the mucociliary apparatus). NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) are recommended for horses with a fever of greater than or equal to 104F (40C).

Prevention of influenza requires hygienic management practices and vaccination. Exposure can be reduced by isolation of newly introduced horses for 2 weeks. Numerous vaccines are commercially available for prevention of equine influenza. An intranasal modified live influenza vaccine, designed to induce mucosal (local) antibody protection, has demonstrated protection against natural challenge. This vaccine is temperature sensitive and is not capable of replicating beyond the nasal passages. The majority of commercially available influenza vaccines are inactivated, adjuvanted vaccines recommended primarily for IM administration. Because the duration of protection provided by current vaccines is limited, booster injections probably should be administered often, e.g., every 3-6 months. Vaccine manufacturers monitor continuously to ensure influenza strain content reflects, as closely as possible, the antigenicity of current strains of field virus.

[Equine influenza viruses are influenza viruses adapted to propagation in horses and other equines and not transmissible to other animals, except occasionally dogs. They are usually antigenically H7N7 or H3N8. There are vaccines available for both types. - Mod.CP]]
