Bird flu outbreak strikes Khanh Hoa
-----------------------------------
A fresh outbreak of avian flu (A/H5N1) has been reported in central
Khanh Hoa Province, killing nearly 10 000 birds.

Affected areas have been decontaminated and poultry incinerated, said
a spokesperson from the provincial Animal Health Unit.

The latest outbreak has brought the number of provinces affected by
the flu to 6: Dien Bien, Nam Dinh, Nghe An, Khanh Hoa, Soc Trang and
Ca Mau, said Hoang Van Nam from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development.

The bird flu epidemic has continued to spread in these provinces,
killing thousands of poultry since it re-emerged last December [2009]
despite efforts to prevent contagion.

Last December [2009], nearly 6000 birds were contaminated with A/H5N1
in southernmost Ca Mau Province alone. Infections spread to 2 more
communes of the province this week [week of 1 Mar 2010], causing 600
affected birds to be culled and raising the total number of affected
communes to 10.

There is a high risk of the flu spreading to other localities,
especially in the Mekong Delta region as ducks migrated during
harvest time, said Nam.

The ministry urged the provinces to increase efforts to combat and
prevent the spread of the flu, and ensure more monitoring of
transportation and poultry slaughterhouses, he added.

The province's poultry flocks would continue to be vaccinated
although it was necessary for households to co-operate with
authorities to inform them about their poultry stocks to ensure
timely vaccinations

Over the last 2 weeks, 3 people from the provinces of Tuyen Quang in
the north, Tien Giang in the south, and Khanh Hoa in the central were
diagnosed with A/H5N1. One of the infected, a 38-year-old woman from
Tien Giang Province, died from the flu.
