Abstract [abridged]
------------------
Since the '30s of the last century, RVF [Rift Valley fever] struck Africa, and to a lesser extent, Asian continent, with subsequent episodes of epizootic, epidemic, and sporadic outbreaks. RVF was not reported in Libya until 13 Jan 2020, where it was reported for the 1st time in a flock of sheep and goats in the southern region of the country. Although insufficient evidence to support RVF clinical cases among the confirmed seropositive animals exists, neither human cases nor death were reported in Libya. Yet, the overtime expansion of RVF kinetics in the Libyan neighborhoods, in addition to the instability and security vacuum experienced in the country, lack of outbreak preparedness, and the availability of suitable climatic and disease vector factors, makes this country a possible future scene candidate for RVF expansion. Urgently, strengthening veterinary services (VS) and laboratory diagnostic capacities, including improvement of monitoring and surveillance activity programs, should be implemented in areas at risk (where imported animals crossing borders from Libyan neighborhoods and competent vectors are found) at national, sub-national, and regional levels. The Libyan government should also implement a tripartite framework (One Health approach) among the veterinary public health, public health authority, and environmental sanitation sectors to implement RVF surveillance protocols, along with an active partnership with competent international bodies (OIE, FAO, and WHO). Therefore, this review comprises the most updated data regarding the epidemiological situation of RVF infections and its socioeconomic impacts on African and Asian continents, and also emphasize the emerging interest of RVF in Libya.

[ProMED thanks Mahmoud Orabi for the submission of the above review, authored by researchers in the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Tripoli, Libya.

The discussion section of the review includes the following notable information:

"Instability and political conflicts during the last years have led to haphazardly huge animal imports, especially from southern countries (Niger and Sudan) with a history of recent RVF outbreaks."

"The lack of entomological surveillance for vectors related to Libyan RVFVs makes it difficult to understand epidemiological patterns of RVFs, especially in the southern region. Livestock market activities where imported animals are gathered in one market characterize these epidemiological patterns. From there, they move forward toward the northern part of the country. Consequently, RVF seropositive animals reported in the southern region are proposed to pose a potential risk of amplification and transmission of RVFVs to another part of the country."

ProMED has posted 3 (RFI; request for information) reports addressing Libya's OIE reports on RVF in 2020. The total number of susceptible animals (sheep and goats) in the 3 reports combined was 630, of which 27 were "cases" (4.28% morbidity rate). The diagnosis was based upon serology. No clinical signs, pathological changes, virus detection, and results of entomological investigations have become available. In addition, it has not been clear if seropositive imported animals were identifiable, to be definitely excluded from the tested flocks in the north. Consequently, and in particular since no human RVF case has been recorded so far in Libya, it appears that, though the circulation of RVF virus there may be suspected, added evidence is required.

The call, included in the abstract for "strengthening veterinary services and laboratory diagnostic capacities, including improvement of monitoring and surveillance activity programs at national, sub-national, and regional levels," "active partnership with competent international bodies (OIE, FAO, and WHO)," and "implementing a tripartite framework (One Health approach)," deserves to be addressed at the earliest. RVF, already present in Egypt, is indeed a serious zoonotic hazard regionally. - Mod.AS
