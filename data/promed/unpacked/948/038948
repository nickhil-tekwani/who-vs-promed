The free living amoeba [_Naegleria fowleri_] that contaminated the water supply of a Texas city and killed a 6-year-old boy has been traced back to a splash pad outside the Lake Jackson civic center.

An investigation by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found the splash pad storage tank created the conditions that allowed the amoeba to develop. The single-celled organism, which lives in freshwater environments, can cause a rare and fatal infection of the brain called primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). Almost all cases of PAM are fatal.

Last month [September 2020] a 6-year-old boy died after being infected with _N. fowleri_. Doctors initially thought he was suffering from a viral infection but he was later found to be suffering from PAM. He died on [8 Sep 2020]. How he got infected was unknown, but his death prompted Lake Jackson city officials to test water samples and close a splash pad as a precaution.

[A splash pad or spray pool is a recreation area, often in a public park, for water play that has little or no standing water. The water is usually either freshwater or recycled and treated water, which is typically treated to at least the same level of quality as swimming pool water standards. This means that the water should be chlorinated. We do not know to which standard the water used in this splash pool was treated. - Mod.EP
