The outbreak of encephalitis that killed three people and prompted an
insecticide spraying of New York City has spread [see #1 below to the
northern suburbs, officials said. Two confirmed cases of St. Louis
encephalitis [SLE, plus one "highly probable" case, have been found among
Westchester County residents, County Executive Andrew Spano said.
None of the Westchester cases has been fatal, but spraying by helicopter
over the densely populated southern third of the county is scheduled to
begin Thursday night. "We have no choice at this particular point,'' Spano
said. "We have to protect the public." [see #2 below
Symptoms of St. Louis encephalitis range from a low fever and headaches to
a high fever, stiff neck, disorientation and tremors. Because it is a
virus, there is no vaccine available to prevent it [see #3 below, but the
symptoms can be treated.
New York City has confirmed 12 cases of the disease, including the three
deaths, since late August. The fatalities were all senior citizens. A
second round of a mosquito-killing spray has begun in the city. Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani said the first application killed 90% of the mosquitoes in
the city. [see #4 below
Westchester County plans to use a pesticide called Anvil which is derived
from chrysanthemums and is less toxic than the malathion used for much of
the New York City spraying.
Spano said areas targeted for spraying would be warned so residents could
close windows and take in children's toys and pet food bowls. All spraying
will be done at night.

[#1: There is no evidence this is "spread". The areas surrounding NY City
have thus far been fortunate not to have SLE cases. Then again, a few to
some to many cases might have occurred and not been recognized. An equally
reasonable conclusion would be that SLE virus has been in Westchester
County all along and that it has not "spread" from NY City.
#2: Good to know they have no choice but to protect the public.
#3: "Because it is a virus, there is no vaccine available to prevent it
..." is just a shade incorrect. There are some vaccines against viruses,
just not one for SLE.
#4: Ah, but which 10% have survived? and where are they?
It was reported today that mosquitoes infected with the SLE virus have been
found on a Greenwich, Connecticut, golf course. The virus was also
isolated from the brain of a dead crow removed from a home in Westport.
Spraying in Greenwich will be conducted by truck-mounted ground sprayers
using resmithrin.
Clearly SLE virus is in NY City, Westchester County, and Connecticut. If
investigations continue it will be found in many other locations. NY City
must be doing an excellent job of mosquito control if only 12 cases have
been detected. An alternative is that the disease is being underdiagnosed.
Close attention to hospital admissions and death records and a
post-epidemic serosurvey should clarify the matter.
Finally, I guess it was inevitable. We have received a message from
someone who wonders whether this was an accidental release of virus from a
US Government facility. If we receive any more such messages we will not
post them either. Some people can see filth in the crotch of a tree. -
