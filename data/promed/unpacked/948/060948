The results of the blood samples sent to the Regional Medical
Research Centre, Dibrugarh for testing the disease [Japanese
encephalitis virus] got [in] this late evening, the Director of State
Health Services, Dr Y Yaima, said to Hueiyen Lanpao. The Director
said that he was informed by the authority of the Regional Medical
Research Centre, Dibrugarh that out of 27 blood sample sent to the
Centre for testing Japanese Encephalitis, 24 of them have been found
positive. He, however, said that official documents are yet to [be]
received. The official results of the testing are likely to get in
the next 1-2 days, Yaima said, adding that officials of the Centre
assured him [they would] provide the results at the earliest so that
state can take up necessary measures to control the disease.

The blood sample collected from patients developing symptoms similar
to the disease was sent to Regional Medical Research Centre,
Dibrugarh on 6 Jul [2010] last. Once the results [are] received, the
particulars of the patients found infecting with the disease could be
ascertained for taking up necessary treatments, the director added.
[In addition to the] above blood samples sent to the Centre at
Diburgarh, his directorate has sent some samples to the National
Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD), New Delhi. The results of
the testing will be received by tomorrow [14 Jul 2010], he believed.

The number of patients suffering from the disease suspected to be
Japanese encephalitis admitted to different hospitals was 66 on 9
July [2010] last but the same [number] was reduced to 61 now, a
highly reliable source said.

In the meantime, state authority has started taking up measure to
control the spreading of the mosquito-borne arboviral disease that
can affect the central nervous system and cause severe complications
and death by way of fogging and distributing medicated mosquito nets
to the people at various places. To discuss further steps, a high
level meeting will be convened tomorrow, said the director.

On the other hand, Newmai News Network today [13 Jul 2010] reported
that since 19 Jun [2010] at least 16 persons have died so far [and]
89 persons are undergoing treatment in the various hospitals in the
state due to the mysterious disease which has similar symptoms
[compatible] with those of the Japanese encephalitis (JE).

[ProMED thanks Ronan Kelly for sending in this report, which provides
the 1st (although still unofficial) laboratory evidence that JE virus
infections are involved in this outbreak in Manipur. The number of
individuals dying of encephalitis has increased from at least 15 on
11 Jul 2010 (see ProMED archive no.20100711.2323) to 16 in this
report. However, the above report indicates that there are 61
suspected JE cases whereas the previous ProMED post states that there
are more than 100. Now that laboratory results will be coming in
soon, it is hoped that the accurate number of cases will become available.
