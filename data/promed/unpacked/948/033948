Experts [from the] Malaysia and Japan have not been able to pin down the
exact virus responsible for the deaths in the recent outbreak.
"The viral outbreak, especially in Sarawak, is under control. Nurseries,
kindergartens and swimming pools can resume operations," said a Sarawak
Deputy Chief Minister. On why the number of deaths was reduced from 31 to
30, he said the patient from Daro died of cryptococcal meningitis (infection
of the brain cover) and was excluded from the viral death list. He said the
number of deaths was low compared to about 4,300 enterovirus infections
reported during the outbreak and another 4,000 a few months before the
outbreak in Sarawak.
"The World Health Organisation advised us that for every reported case,
another five other cases can be expected to go unreported," he said. The
Government advised parents to stop sending children to nurseries,
kindergartens and schools which were dirty. Children with hand, foot and
mouth disease symptoms must be treated immediately.
Until Sunday, 4,246 of the 4,368 children with HFM [hand-foot-and mouth
disease] symptoms admitted to hospitals nationwide had been discharged.
Health authorities would continue to monitor the situation nationwide but it
will take some time before the health authorities could be sure what caused
the viral deaths and why it only attacked small children.
