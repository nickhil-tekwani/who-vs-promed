Chinese authorities say they have found the H7N9 strain of bird flu in a wild pigeon. They say it's the 1st time the virus has been detected in wild birds.

Officials of the Ministry of Agriculture say they found the virus in a wild pigeon caught in the city of Nanjing, Jiangsu Province.

They say the genetic sequence of the virus is very similar to that discovered in pigeons sold at a Shanghai market. The officials say wild birds could be spreading the virus among poultry. They will further investigate the infection sources and routes.

The Chinese authorities confirmed on Tuesday [16 Apr 2013] the deaths of 2 patients in Shanghai and 14 new cases of human infection. This brings the total number of cases to 78 and the death toll to 16.

Cases of infection have so far been reported in the cities of Shanghai and Beijing as well as the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Henan.

The authorities have been culling birds after the virus was found in live poultry sold at markets in areas where infections were reported.

[3] Jiangsu (Nanjing): free-roaming pigeon, chicken
Date: Tue 16 Apr 2013

A total of 5 poultry samples in east China have tested positive for H7N9, the country's agriculture authority said on Tuesday [16 Apr 2013].

The avian flu virus, which has so far led to the deaths of 14 people nationwide, was detected in one pigeon sample from Jiangsu Province and 4 chicken samples from Zhejiang Province, the Ministry of Agriculture said in a statement.

The pigeon sample is from Nanjing, capital city of Jiangsu, and the other samples are from Huzhou city, in Zhejiang.

After gene sequence analysis, the national avian flu reference laboratory concluded that the strain of the H7N9 virus found in the 5 samples was highly congeneric with that found in a pigeon on 4 Apr 2013.

The ministry has ordered the 2 provinces to carry out proper disposal strictly in line with relevant guidelines and increase the monitoring scope of the virus. Thorough disinfection is obligatory.

[4] Taiwan: preventive measures

Concerns about the H7N9 bird flu have prompted Taiwan to impose a ban on slaughtering live poultry at traditional markets from 17 Jun 2013.

The move is a preventive effort aimed at limiting contact between human beings and poultry, and live poultry will be sent to designated slaughterhouses, Huang Kwo-ching, an official with the island's agricultural authority, said at a press conference on Tuesday [16 Apr 2013].

Huang said the ban could be imposed earlier than planned, depending on the spread of the H7N9 virus, which has led to the deaths of 14 people on the mainland as of Tuesday [16 Apr 2013].

So far, no cases have been confirmed on the island, he said.

The island's disease control authorities said Tuesday [16 Apr 2013] that Taiwan will soon obtain samples of the H7N9 virus from the mainland that could be used to develop vaccines.

Chang Feng-yee, chief of the island's disease control authority, said the mainland has set the virus delivery date, which Chang refused to reveal.

According to the latest survey conducted by the island's disease control command center, 71 percent of the 1293 Taiwanese people surveyed are concerned that the H7N9 bird flu outbreak will hit Taiwan, while more than 30 percent have reduced their consumption of eggs and poultry products.

[5] Surveillance in domestic animals
Date: Wed 17 Apr 2013

Animal infections of the H7N9 avian flu have only been detected in live poultry markets and a single wild pigeon, agricultural authorities said Wednesday [17 Apr 2013].

Of the 47 801 samples collected from more than 1000 poultry markets, habitats, farms, and slaughterhouses across the country, 39 samples have tested positive for the virus, the Ministry of Agriculture said in a statement.

Of the 39 positive samples, 38 came from live poultry markets in east China's Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, central China's Anhui Province and the city of Shanghai.

A wild pigeon tested positive for the virus in Jiangsu [see OIE notification, item 1 above].

The virus has not been detected in pigs, the ministry said.

[6] Infection source sought
Date: Wed 17 Apr 2013

The World Health Organization [WHO] said on Wed 17 Apr 2013 that a number of people who have tested positive for a new strain of bird flu in China have had no history of contact with poultry, adding to the mystery about a virus that has killed 16 people to date.

Chinese authorities have slaughtered thousands of birds and closed some live poultry markets to try and stem the rate of human infection, but many questions remain unsolved, including whether the H7N9 strain is being transmitted between people.

WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl confirmed that "there are people who have no history of contact with poultry," after a top Chinese scientist was quoted as saying about 40 percent of those with the H7N9 flu had had no such contact.

"This is one of the puzzles still (to) be solved and therefore argues for a wide investigation net," Hartl said in emailed comments, though he did not know the exact percentage.

Hartl said several avenues should be explored by an international team of experts going to China soon, including the possibility that the virus can be spread between people, although there is "no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission."

"It might be because of dust at the wet markets, it could be another animal source beside poultry, it could also be human-to-human transmission," he said by telephone.

Wendy Barclay, an influenza expert at Imperial College London, said it was likely to be very difficult to determine or rule out people's exact exposure to poultry -- or to wild birds, which could also be a possible source of infection.

"The incubation time might be quite long, so visiting a market even 14 days before might have resulted in infection," she said.

China has warned that the number of infections could rise from the current 77. The majority of the cases have been in China's commercial capital Shanghai, the official Xinhua news agency said on Tuesday [16 Apr 2013].

China reported 3 new bird flu outbreaks to the World Animal Health Organization (OIE) this week, bringing the total number of places to 11, the OIE said on its website [see item 1 above].

Samples have tested positive in some poultry markets that remain the focus of investigation by China and the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO].

Zeng Guang, the chief scientist in charge of epidemiology at the China Disease Prevention and Control Center (CDPCC), said about 40 percent of human victims had no clear history of poultry exposure, the Beijing News reported on Wednesday [17 Apr 2013].

According to state media reports, only 10 of the 77 cases as of Tuesday [16 Apr 2013] have had contact with poultry. The CDPCC declined to comment when asked by Reuters.

A study published last week showed the H7N9 strain was a so-called "triple reassortant" virus with a mixture of genes from 3 other flu strains found in birds in Asia. One of those 3 strains is thought to have come from a brambling, a type of small wild bird.

"We can't rule out that this ... has passed through poultry but then been reintroduced to a wild bird population from which some spread to humans might be occurring," Barclay said.

China's poultry sector has recorded losses of more than USD 1.6 billion since reports emerged of the strain 2 weeks ago, while authorities have slaughtered thousands of birds and closed live poultry markets in Shanghai and Beijing.

China said on Sunday [14 Apr 2013] the virus had spread outside the Yangtze River delta region in eastern China, with cases reported in Beijing and the central province of Henan.

[The information on samples collected in "poultry markets, habitats, farms, and slaughterhouses across the country" (item 5 above) is interesting and encouraging; further, more specified details will be helpful.

Pigeons are often found in the surroundings of human dwellings or make part of urban fauna, even if seen/reported as "wild" (pigeons kept for consumption are defined as "poultry"). According to China's follow-up report no 3 to the OIE, dated 16 Apr 2013 (item 1 above), the "wild" pigeon was sampled in Nanjing. No positive cases in "poultry" have been reported from Nanjing; on the other hand, 5 human cases have been reported there: one on 2 Apr 2013, 2 cases on 5 Apr 2013, and 2 on 14 Apr 2013 (see Chinese source at http://news.sina.com.cn/z/qlgdt2013/).

Interestingly, the very 1st animal (bird) which, reportedly, was found infected by the new, zoonotic LPAI H7N9 virus strain during the emerging epidemic in eastern China, was a "consumption pigeon" (in an agricultural products wholesale market, Songjiang, Shanghai; sampled on 4 Apr 2013).

To assess the significance of these findings, denominator data are in need. Which animal species have been sampled in each location so far, what were their respective numbers, and what were their tests results?

It will be of particular interest to obtain information on surveillance in wild birds and migratory birds, including water birds, which potentially might become environmental (including water sources) contaminants. - Mod.AS]
