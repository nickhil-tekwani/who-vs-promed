---------------------------
Have they eliminated the possibility of cross-reactivity with apparently non-pathogenic-for-humans ebolavirus types equivalent to Ebola-Reston, known in the Philippines to be resident in pigs?

[ProMED appreciates Mr Lloyd-Evans' comment. If there is anyone with knowledge or data bearing on the specificity of serology for ebolaviruses in pigs, we would be interested in learning about it. - Mod.LM

Some additional considerations on this topic:

Ebola-Reston infects humans but does not kill them -- see 2015 ProMED archive below -- so could not have been involved in the present human epidemic. Also:

- Sierra Leone had only 35 000 pigs in 2005 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture_in_Sierra_Leone#cite_note-rebuild-11 [latest available figures, but may have more since then] and see map in page 5 at http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/resources/en/publications/sector_briefs/lsb_SLE.pdf.

- Liberia had 265 000 pigs in 2010 http://www.fao.org/ag/agp/agpc/doc/counprof/Liberia/liberia.htm but a footnote states a recent report by Koikoi (2011) suggests that numbers of livestock are much lower than the FAO data in this Table.

- Guinea had 96 344 in 2014 http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Countryinformation/Animalpopulation.

Compare with Uganda, which had 3.9 million pigs in 2014 http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Countryinformation/Animalpopulation. So, even adding a few thousand wild and feral pigs (supposing they are infected), they cannot be anywhere near as important to transmission to humans in West Africa as they are potentially in Uganda.

In addition, in Africa the wild boar distribution is limited to the northern regions and to the Nile valley (down to South Sudan; map at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_boar#/media/File:Sus_scrofa_range_map.jpg.

The common warthog population in southern Africa is estimated to be about 250 000. Typical densities range between 1 and 10 per km2 in protected areas, but local densities of 77 per km2 were found on short grass in Nakuru National Park. Wild boar (and subsequent trichinosis) has been reported also from Ethiopia. - Mods.AS/JW
