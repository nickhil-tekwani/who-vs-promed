Hubei reports 340 cases of hand-foot-mouth disease
--------------------------------------------------
Central China's Hubei Province has seen 340 cases of hand-foot-mouth
disease this year [2008], but no deaths reported, local health
authorities said on Friday [2 May 2008].

At least 5 cases were caused by an intestinal virus known as human
enterovirus 71 (EV 71) which has left 21 children dead and 2946 ill
in Fuyang City, in neighboring Anhui Province, since early March
[2008].

Most of the cases in Hubei were isolated, except for 39 children aged
3 and 4 reported at 3 kindergartens in Guanghua district, Qianjiang
City since 29 Apr 2008, the Provincial Health Department said in a
statement. Experts from the provincial disease control center
collected and tested samples from 5 children on Thursday morning [1
May 2008], determining that they had been infected with EV71, it
said. But no figures were provided on the total number of children in
the city and the province at large who have been infected with EV71.
According to the statement, 33 children in Qianjiang have recovered
or are recovering, and 6 are being treated as outpatients.

No new cases of hand-foot-mouth disease have been reported in Hubei
since 30 Apr 2008, it said, and local health authorities have been
ordered to make daily reports on the disease. "Experts from the
provincial disease control center are still in Qianjiang to guide the
disease control work," the statement said.

Hand-foot-mouth disease is a common childhood illness that mainly
affects children under 10. Symptoms include fever, sores in the mouth
and a rash with blisters. It often begins with a sore throat.
Moderately contagious, the disease, more common in summer and autumn,
can be transmitted through nose and throat discharges. It can
sometimes be fatal if complications occur.

China 1st reported hand-foot-mouth disease in Shanghai in 1981. An
outbreak of the disease in northern Tianjin in 1983 caused more than
7000 infections. Last year in Linyi City, eastern Shandong Province,
2 boys and a girl, all under the age of 2, died from the disease.
EV71 can cause hand, foot and mouth disease, which usually starts
with a slight fever followed by blisters and ulcers in the mouth and
rashes on hands and feet. It may also cause high fever, meningitis,
encephalitis, pulmonary edema and paralysis in a small number of
children. Infection can lead to high death rates in serious cases and
no vaccine id available.

Practice good hygiene to keep foot and mouth disease at bay
-----------------------------------------------------------
Sarawak is stepping up prevention and control measures for hand foot
and mouth disease (HFMD) following recent outbreaks in Singapore and
China. Deputy Chief Minister Tan Sri Dr. George Chan said the state
health department's routine HFMD surveillance showed that 1729 cases
of the disease had been reported as of April 26 this year [2008],
including 3 small, localised outbreaks.

The 1st occurred at Universiti Malaysia Sarawak (Unimas) on 10-25 Mar
2008 involving 48 adults, the 2nd in Kampung Pichin, Serian (4-22 Apr
2008) involving 24 children and the last at Al Hidayah Abim Nursery
in Sarikei (9-24 Apr 2008) involving 10 children. Dr. Chan said none
of the cases involved enterovirus 71 (EV71), which potentially causes
a more severe form of the disease. "The outbreaks were mild and no
one was hospitalised. All the outbreaks have now been controlled.

"However, because of the increased number of cases in Singapore
including a few with EV71, and also in Anhui, China, where there have
been 20 deaths, this is a good time to warn the public, especially
those looking after young children, to make sure they follow hygienic
practices," he told a press conference at his office here on Friday
[2 May 2008].

He said parents with young children and operators of childcare
centres should take preventive measures such as practising good
hygiene at all times. He also advised childcare centre operators to
make sure their premises were clean and to screen children for
symptoms of HFMD, In addition, parents of young children should take
the necessary precautions, such as washing their hands before eating
and after going to the toilet, covering their mouths and noses when
coughing or sneezing and ensuring cleanliness in their homes,
including their children's toys.

Sarawak last experienced a major outbreak of HFMD in 2006, when more
than 14 000 cases and 13 deaths were reported.

[According to the WHO non-polio enteroviruses are common and
distributed worldwide. Although infection often has no symptoms and
goes unnoticed, these viruses are also associated with occasional
outbreaks in which a larger-than-usual number of patients develop
clinical disease, sometimes with fatal consequences. Currently human
enterovirus 71 is associated with outbreaks of HFMD in the Chinese
provinces of Anhui and Hubei.

Since the preceding report from Anhui dated 1 May 2008 (see: Hand,
foot & mouth disease - China (03): (Anhui), WHO 20080501.1504) the
number of confirmed case of HFMD has increased from 1884 to 2946 and
the number of fatalities has risen from 20 to 21. In Anhui province
the outbreak is centered on the city of Fuyang, whereas a similar
outbreak in the neighboring province of Hubei is more dispersed and
fewer cases and no deaths have been reported so far.

By contrast a contemporaneous outbreak of HFMD in the Sarawak
province of Malaysia, which does not involve human enterovirus 71,
although extensive, is following a milder course.
