There are a number of folks who could probably help you: I have listed three
here.
Jim Harris,Ph.D. at the State Health Department, gives numerous excellent
workshops on fungi and is also the secretary of Medical Mycology Society of
the Americas. His e-mail address is jharris@laba.tdh.state.tx.us
Other possibilities include Dr. Mike Rinaldi at UTHSC in San Antonio,
Rinaldi@uthscsa.edu (works with lots of different fungi, laboratory
identification and susceptibilities)
and
Dr. Demo Pappagianis at UCLA , who has worked with Cocci for a long time.
His e-mail address is sarussell@ucdavis.edu

You might want to make sure no humans have been exposed to whatever the
animals were exposed to. Good luck with the problem.
