A team of veterinary doctors and experts culled more than 600 ducks and 66 chickens on [Sun 31 Mar 2019] following confirmation of bird flu (H5N1) in the city [Cuttack].

An outbreak of bird flu was suspected after death of ducks in the Duck Breeding Centre and Dairy Farm at Khapuria. On 23 Mar 2019, as many as 13 ducks died on the day in the farm. District veterinary office investigated into the incident and sent blood samples to the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD) in Bhopal. "The samples tested positive for the H5N1 or avian influenza virus," informed chief district veterinary officer Premananda Rout.

"Following the test report, we culled ducks and chickens. Moreover, 3.6 quintal [360 kg] of foodgrains were destroyed as well.

Carcasses of culled birds were buried in 10-foot deep pits. Bleaching powder and other disinfectants were sprinkled while filling up the pits to prevent spread of H5N1 virus," added Rout.

All the poultry farms in 1-km radius of the breeding centre have been banned for the time being. The farms will remain closed for the next 6 months according to guidelines, added Rout.
