[1] Scotland, 1st case

Eight cows from Dumfries and Galloway have tested positive for Schmallenberg virus (SBV) antibodies, indicating exposure to the disease last year [2012], although at a low prevalence.

SBV is spread by midges, and cases of the virus were reported across Europe last year [2012].

A small number of animals which were recently moved into Scotland tested positive for SBV, but the 8 Dumfries and Galloway animals were all homebred, providing the 1st evidence to suggest exposure to infected midges in Scotland.

The 8 cows are part of a 160-strong dairy herd at Barony campus of Scotland's Rural College. No deformed calves have yet been born.

Rural Affairs Secretary Richard Lochhead said: "Since SBV was 1st detected in the south of England, we have watched it spread slowly northwards. Confirmation of its arrival in Scotland is, therefore, no surprise but is nonetheless disappointing and undoubtedly a headache, which farmers could do without at the moment. Following that confirmation, farmers should continue to exercise vigilance, particularly when moving animals onto their farm and should consider testing breeding stock for the SBV antibody. Current evidence from surveillance carried out across Europe suggests that infection with SBV has a relatively low impact, but we know that it can cause difficulties when cows or ewes are infected in the early stages of pregnancy."

The Ulster Farmers' Union is calling on farmers to remain vigilant and cautious following confirmation that SBV has been found in a 2nd calf in County Down.

The details surrounding this particular case are not yet known; however, this was not unexpected given the way the virus has spread elsewhere.

UFU President Harry Sinclair said: "We are disappointed that the SBV has made its way to Northern Ireland. SBV is a non-notifiable virus, which does not have any trade implications and poses no threat to human health. The real concern for farmers is the possible losses on farm due to an increase in foetal mortality. The UFU are appealing to all farmers to stay vigilant and report any suspected cases of the virus. We are also encouraging farmers to send animals that are displaying clinical signs of the virus to AFBI for post-mortem testing, which will be free of charge. At this stage, Republic of Ireland have reported 65 cases, and this is continuing to increase. Given the way the virus has spread in mainland GB and across the continent, we are expecting more cases as we move into spring."

Mr Sinclair continued: "A vaccine for the virus has been developed and is currently going through the Veterinary Medicines Directorate authorisation system. However, if on-farm losses average at 2-3 percent, it may not be cost effective to vaccinate all stock. Also, immunity is developed once an animal has been infected; therefore, it appears that any animals affected this year [2013] will develop their own immunity and will not be affected again next year."

[3] UK, surveillance data
Date: 27 Feb 2013

http://www.defra.gov.uk/ahvla-en/files/20130227sbv-statistics.pdf


The enclosed table [see summarised data below. - Mod.AS] includes additional serology results provided by laboratories at Liverpool University and Scotland's Rural College. Results from Scotland have not been listed by county as they all relate to animals introduced into Scotland from counties where SBV has been reported. For the 1st time, SBV antibodies have been detected in blood samples from goats and alpacas.

Surveillance statistics published by AHVLA have given an indication of the geographical spread of the disease and helped farmers make informed business decisions. As the disease has now been detected in all counties in England and Wales and the enhanced surveillance initiatives ceased in December 2012, the data have become less meaningful. Statistics for England and Wales will in future be published on a calendar quarterly basis. Statistics for Scotland will be published as frequently as is necessary to keep farmers informed of the detection and spread of the disease [Since the publication of this report, the 1st positive serological results in endemic Scottish cattle have been detected; see item 1 above.].

Sheep farmers can complete a brief online survey to gather data that will help build a picture of the lamb crop for 2013. The survey, a joint initiative supported by NSA, AHVLA, Eblex, HCC, NBA, NFU and QMS, should be completed when an individual farm has finished a particular lambing batch and will remain open to late May 2013. The survey can be accessed at: https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/WWHBNC5.

Farmers should contact their veterinarians if they have concerns, and vets should contact their local AHVLA Investigation Centre if they require advice.

[The following summarised results have been derived from the full table, which provides detailed geographical data. For these details, please go to the source URL].

1. Cattle
Fetal malformation: 64; Serology: 991; Acute Disease: 24
2. Sheep
Fetal malformation: 321; Serology: 128
3. Goat
Serology: 2
4. Alpaca:
Serology: 1

Grand total: 1531 SBV-positive holdings.

[Since SBV has not been declared a notifiable disease, the information on its true prevalence in Europe is voluntary, thus partial. For European farmers, this may mean a difficulty in deciding about future measures and in particular the cost-benefit aspects of vaccination, as referred to by the Ulster Farmers' Union (item 2). It may be assumed that similar considerations are applicable in other European countries. Hopefully, all countries follow N. Ireland's pattern of providing SBV diagnostic services free of charge.

In view of the recent findings regarding the possible scenario of SBV spread by bovine semen and embryos and the published results of studies which showed that SBV grew efficiently in all the cell lines tested, including human 293T (20130223.1556721), it may be anticipated that the international trade aspects of animals and germplasm from SBV-infected countries and countries within an infected region will be scientifically clarified. This might be preferably arranged within the framework of the OIE. At present, the issue is agreed to between trade partners on a bilateral basis. - Mod.AS
