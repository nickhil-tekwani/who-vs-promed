In light of the isolation of the 1st _Staphylococcus aureus_ resistant to vancomycin in Latin America, the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) recommend that Member States continue to establish and maintain their capacity for rapid detection and reporting of this resistance mechanism to antibiotics for the implementation of infection prevention and control measures associated with health care.

Current situation
----------------
In 2002, the 1st 2 isolates of vancomycin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (VRSA) were reported in the United States. Isolates with vancomycin resistance mechanism were associated with the combination of the resistance genes of type _Enterococcus faecalis_ Van A. By 2012, 11 isolates of VRSA had been reported, 9 of which were isolated in the United States, one in Iran, and one in India. Most of the 9 isolates in the United States were isolated in the state of Michigan. In general, they caused skin and soft tissue infections in patients with underlying chronic diseases.

The 1st finding of VRSA in Latin America was reported in Brazil by the Microbiology Laboratory of the Hospital de Clinicas, of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil. According to the information reported to PAHO/WHO, a methicillin-resistant strain and vancomycin were isolated in the blood culture of a patient at that hospital in December 2012. The presence of the resistance mechanism in the isolation has been confirmed through the collaboration of microbiologists in Bogota, Colombia, and the United States.

This is the 1st isolation from a blood culture sample. The concerned patient is a 35-year-old male who had been diagnosed with Sezary syndrome, was diabetic, and had other associated infections for which he had previously been treated with vancomycin and teicoplanin. The bacteremia was controlled with daptomycin; however, the patient continued to have different episodes of infection and died 3 months after the isolation of VRSA.

Molecular studies of the isolation revealed the presence _vanA_ gene; this gene was also detected in the _E. faecalis_ isolated from the patient as part of routine surveillance. The finding suggests that the latter is the genetic donor mechanism. Further molecular studies are underway. No secondary cases have been reported.

Recommendations
------------------
Surveillance measures and epidemiological investigation:
1. Increase national laboratories' participation in the surveillance systems of health care services for the early detection of this resistance mechanism and for corresponding reporting to the relevant authorities to implement early control measures.
2. Ensure the application of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines by laboratory participants in the national surveillance network of antimicrobial resistance for the proper detection of this resistance mechanism; implement necessary detection tests, including determining the minimum inhibitory concentration and molecular methods for confirmation.
3. Refer the vancomycin-resistant isolates detected by standardized methods to national or regional reference laboratories for confirmation and molecular typing.
4. Disseminate information obtained through national surveillance activities in order to employ appropriate antimicrobial treatment and to implement infection control measures at health care facilities.

Laboratory detection
---------------------
These isolates are characterized as methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA), and the 1st line of detection is performed by using cefoxitin as per the CLSI (2013). The minimum vancomycin inhibitory concentration should then be determined. The results are interpreted in accordance with the Antimicrobial susceptibility Determination Standard, M100 S23. The isolates with vancomycin resistance, which are confirmed in accordance with the above mentioned methodologies, must be submitted to a national or regional reference center for molecular characterization.

Antimicrobial treatment
------------------------
Given limited clinical experience, antimicrobial treatment decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the clinical situation, localization of infection, and the resistance profile. Options for treatment could include linezolid and daptomycin.

Infection prevention and control
----------------------------------
The following precautions are recommended, in addition to standard precautions, when a patient has been identified as being colonized or infected with VRSA: Strictly implement hand hygiene measures such as using soap and water or glycerine alcohol before and after contact with the patient or their environment and contaminated objects; Implement contact precautions, as recommended for containment of other multi-resistant bacteria; It is mandatory to wear gloves and a clinical robe for the care of patients infected with VRSA; Isolation in a single room or cohort. If there is a cohort, ensure separation between beds of more than one meter; and Cleaning the environment with chlorine (bleach) diluted (1:100).

[_Staphylococcus aureus_ isolates that are vancomycin-susceptible have minimal inhibitory concentrations of vancomycin (MICs) in the range of 0.5-2 mcg/ml. Over the past several decades, _S. aureus_, including methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA), have increasingly developed reduced susceptibility to vancomycin. There are several types of MRSA with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin. The 1st type to appear, now called VISA (vancomycin-intermediate _Staphylococcus aureus_), is thought to be due to thickening of the organism's cell wall that prevents vancomycin from reaching its target. These isolates have a vancomycin MIC between 8-16 mcg/ml. VISA were 1st identified in Japan in 1996 and have since been found in the United Kingdom, France, the U.S., Germany, Korea, and Brazil (Oliveira GA, Dell'Aquila AM, Masiero RL et al. Isolation in Brazil of nosocomial _Staphylococcus aureus_ with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin. Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol 2001;22(7):443-448).

Another type of vancomycin resistance, high-level vancomycin resistance in _S. aureus_, has been rarely reported. Noble et al demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo conjugative transfer of the _vanA_ gene complex, located on a mobile genetic element, from _Enterococcus faecalis_ to _S. aureus_, which led to a highly vancomycin resistant strain (Noble WC, Virani Z, Cree RG. Co-transfer of vancomycin and other resistance genes from _Enterococcus faecalis_ NCTC 12201 to _Staphylococcus aureus_. FEMS Microbiol Lett 1992;72:195-198). This type of vancomycin resistance is due to an alteration of the vancomycin-binding site in the bacterial cell wall. These isolates in which vancomycin resistance is mediated by _vanA_ have vancomycin MICs of over 32 ug/ml.

Subsequently, in 2002, MRSA carrying the enterococcal vanA gene complex and expressing high level resistance to vancomycin was identified in clinical specimens: A VRSA strain (MIC over 128 mcg/mL) was isolated from the catheter tip of a diabetic, renal dialysis patient in Michigan (CDC. _Staphylococcus aureus_ Resistant to Vancomycin --- United States, 2002. MMWR 2002;51, 565-567). The patient's chronic foot ulcer appeared infected, and VRSA and vancomycin-resistant _E. faecalis_ (VRE) were recovered from a culture of the ulcer. The presence of _vanA_ in this VRSA suggested exchange of genetic material from the vancomycin-resistant enterococcus also isolated from the swab culture.

From 2002 to 2010, 10 additional VRSA isolates were reported, 8 from the United States, one from Iran (http://www.karger.com/Article/Fulltext/141513), and one from India (Banerjee T, Anupurba S. Colonization with Vancomycin-Intermediate _Staphylococcus aureus_ Strains Containing the vanA Resistance Gene in a Tertiary-Care Center in North India. J Clin Microbiol. 2012; 50(5): 1730-1732. Available at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3347155/.) VRSA are susceptible in vitro to several antimicrobial agents, including daptomycin, linezolid, tigecycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ceftobiprole, and quinupristin/dalfopristin), but isolates should be tested in vitro for the presence of resistance that may have developed to these antibiotics.

The CDC published in 2006 a document entitled "Investigation and Control of Vancomycin-Intermediate and -Resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (VISA/VRSA): A Guide for Health Departments and Infection Control Personnel," which provides guidance in conducting a public health evaluation of patients from whom VISA and VRSA have been isolated or suspected (http://www.cdc.gov/hai/pdfs/visa_vrsa/visa_vrsa_guide.pdf). - Mod.ML
