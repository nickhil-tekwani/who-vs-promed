There is great concern among cattle ranchers in the municipalities of
Tiquisio and Achi [Bolivar department] because of the sudden death of
57 heads of cattle in less than 15 days. The information was provided
by local people, who said that yesterday [20 Aug 2010] in a farm in
the locality of Puerto Coca [municipality of Tiquisio], 27 heads of
cattle from a total of 230 animals that arrived from Sincerin
[municipality of Achi] 15 days ago died in less than 24 hours.

In addition, 30 animals also brought from Sincerin, died 2 weeks ago
in Playa de Barro (Puerto Venecia, Achi). The cattle ranchers in the
area said that the animals had been vaccinated against FMD, triple,
and brucellosis, during the 1st vaccination cycle in 2010 [3 May-16 Jun 2010].

Heavy rains have affected the area and ranchers have had to move
their animals from flood prone areas to higher ground.

Veterinarian Manuel Hernandez Arrieta, director of Tiquisio's UMATA
[Municipal Unit of Agricultural Technical Assistance], traveled to
the affected farm and collected the required samples, which were sent
to the sectional ICA [Instituto Colombiano Agropecuario -- Colombian
Agricultural Institute] in Magangue for analysis to determine the
cause of death.

Massive intoxication has killed 36 cattle in southern Bolivar
department, Colombia.

"We have so far ruled out, any contagious disease such as FMD," said
Alvaro Monterrosa, director of the ICA in this region.

At least 36 heads of cattle have died in a case of mass intoxication
in a rural area of the municipality of Tiquisio, South Bolivar.

Monterrosa said it appeared the animals consumed a marine plant that
causes serious poisoning.

[The articles do not tell us what other infectious or contagious
diseases other than FMD have been ruled out.

While plant intoxications are known to occur, and can kill large
numbers of animals, I am uncertain what marine plant may be involved.
This area of Colombia has had abundant rains. Toxic plants may easily
have grown, or been stressed, or have seeded, and all of this may
make a plant toxic.

More information on this outbreak from knowledgeable sources in the
region would be gratefully appreciated. - Mods.TG/MPP]
