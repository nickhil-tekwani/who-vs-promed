The Ministry of Consumption has launched this Saturday [24 Sep 2022] an alert for the presence of _Listeria_ in several packages of sausages from Italy and distributed in Spain. These are different batches of the Wudy and Pavo brands. The department is not aware that it has affected Spain, although in Italy and other European countries they have caused an outbreak of listeriosis, a disease that can cause fever, headache, vomiting, or diarrhoea, and above all serious problems for people. pregnant women and their fetuses. The withdrawal of all products has already been requested and those who have any at home are recommended not to consume them.

The Spanish Agency for Food Safety and Nutrition (AESAN), dependent on the ministry, has received an alert from the Italian authorities through the European Food Alert Network (RASFF), [reporting that the bacterium _Listeria monocytogenes_ was detected in different batches of sausages from Italy, from the brands] Wudy Clásico, Wudy Queso, Wudy Parti, Wudy Happy Hour, Wudy Maxipack Clásico, and Pavo Hot Dog.

After an inspection at the Italian manufacturing plant, the bacterium was found in 2 batches of products, only marketed in Italy. It was also detected in the environmental sampling carried out in the establishment, so as a precautionary measure, all the products manufactured in these facilities have been withdrawn as they are considered potentially affected. The AESAN has transferred the information to the autonomous communities so that the withdrawal of the affected products in stores and supermarkets can be verified, which has already been launched.

As a precautionary measure, it is recommended that people who have these products in their homes do not consume them and deliver them to the points of sale, which must return the money. In the case of having consumed any of them and presenting symptoms compatible with listeriosis (fever, headache, vomiting or diarrhoea), it is recommended to go to a health center or hospital as soon as possible.

In the case of being pregnant, it is recommended to consult the consumption recommendations during pregnancy of the AESAN, which include information on good food hygiene practices that are important for pregnant women, as well as a list of foods that should be avoided during pregnancy because they are associated with certain biological hazards (among which listeria stands out). The state agency recalls the importance of extreme hygiene measures to avoid cross contamination to other products [https://www.aesan.gob.es/AECOSAN/web/para_el_consumidor/ampliacion/contaminacion_cruzada.htm; in Spanish].

The largest outbreak of listeriosis in Spain occurred in 2019 as a result of _Listeria_ contamination at the Magrudis factory in Seville. The outbreak left more than 200 cases reported in Andalusia, and some more in the rest of Spain, including 4 deaths and s6ix abortions. [See 2019 posts listed below.]

[We are not told details about the outbreak in Italy or if genotyping has been done on isolates from patients, food, or the manufacturing facility.

In the USA and Europe, a common source is presumed for a cluster of cases of listeriosis if the clinical isolates of _Listeria_ have the same genotype. A certain food is confirmed to be the source if the genotype of _Listeria_ isolated from that food matches that of the clinical outbreak strain.

More information on the outbreak in Italy and genotyping would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
