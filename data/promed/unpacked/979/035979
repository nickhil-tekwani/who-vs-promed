Greek authorities said on [Fri 25 Aug 2017] that 3 people in Greece infected with the West Nile virus [WNV] died of complications related to the illness this summer [2017]. All cases were reported in August and all victims were over 70 years old, the national Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KEELPNO) noted.

A total of 37 cases have been detected this year [2017], including a patient who is still in hospital in intensive care experts said. In most cases, patients suffered from mild symptoms. It was mainly elderly patients with other chronic illnesses who faced severe complications, according to KEELPNO.

The West Nile virus was first detected in Greece in 2010, when 262 confirmed cases of the disease were recorded, among them, 35 fatal. No cases were recorded in 2015 and 2016. KEELPNO advised the public to take measures to protect themselves against mosquitoes which can transmit the dangerous virus.

[Infection from WNV has been an important public health issue for many European countries, including Greece, since 2010. WNV circulation has been recorded in several countries across the European continent, both in Central Europe and in the Mediterranean basin. In addition to management of individual cases, strategies for vector control, community involvement, and effective risk communication are required for effective control of West Nile virus disease as for other vector borne illnesses. - Mod.UBA
