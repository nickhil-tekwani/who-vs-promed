Screwworm CONFIRMED from Florida Equine
------------------------------------------
Conference calls were held yesterday afternoon and today to discuss
Veterinary Services (VS) actions concerning the confirmation of screwworm
larvae on 4 March 2000 from a 4-year-old Thoroughbred gelding in Florida
that was part of a shipment of 17 horses from Argentina.
OIE was notified of the situation 6 March 2000 via FAX.
Fourteen of the other 16 horses have been located, examined, and found to
be free of larvae or wounds. One horse in Florida had been moved to
Sarasota and was to be examined today. One horse in California also was to
be examined today.
Dr. Rob Southall has gone to the West Palm Beach/Wellington, Florida area
and will be coordinating VS efforts in Florida. Dr. John Parsons is doing
FAD investigations in Florida. The horse that was infested with screwworm
larvae was given a second treatment 6 March 2000. VS-Florida sent
information to practitioners in the area to inform them of the situation.
The Eastern Region has alerted 2 members of the Early Response Team their
assistance may be needed.
National Center for Import and Export are notifying the ports, through the
regions, of the need for increased vigilance in their physical examination
of horses for screwworm.
As stated in the 6 March 2000 warning, based on what we currently know
about the situation, we are not planning to release sterile flies. Larvae
were found from one horse. This horse was in a one-eighth acre paddock
isolated on three sides. The horse and the paddock were treated on 3 March
2000. The horse also received a second treatment on 6 March 2000. Two or
three horses in an adjacent paddock were examined; no wounds were observed
on these horses.
NVSL reported that the screwworm larvae were at least 24 hours from
maturity when they were collected on 2 March 2000; thus, it is unlikely
that any larvae dropped from the wound on or before 2 March 2000. Thorough
treatment of the premises on 3 March 2000 was provided to ensure any larvae
that may have exited the wound were killed.
When larvae drop from a wound, they burrow into the soil where they enter
the pupal stage, which lasts 5 to 7 days. Adult flies emerge from the pupal
cases and are ready to mate within 3 to 5 days. Thus, any new cases would
not be seen until 15 March 2000.
In this situation, sentinel animals are the best way to conduct
surveillance for screwworm flies. VS is recommending that 4 sentinel
animals be placed around the premises. Practitioners in the area also are
being notified to increase their surveillance for possible screwworm
infestations. The decision regarding release of sterile flies will be
reevaluated as the situation evolves. If you have any questions, please
contact Emergency Programs staff at 301-734-8073, 800-940-6524, or
EMOC@USDA.GOV. Please forward this information to State counterparts as
necessary.
