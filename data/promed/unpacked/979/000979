Avian influenza situation in Viet Nam - WHO update 11
-----------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health has reported 2 new confirmed human cases of A (H5N1)
avian influenza infection on 6 and 9 Apr 2010. These cases were confirmed
at the National Institute for Hygiene and Epidemiology.

The 1st case is a 22 year old man from Nhu Co commune, Bac Kan province. He
developed symptoms on 28 Mar 2010 and was transferred to the National
Hospital of Tropical Diseases in severe condition. Confirmatory test
results for influenza A (H5) were obtained on 3 Apr 2010. The initial
epidemiological investigations show that there were sick/dead poultry at
the patient's home and in the surrounding areas.

The 2nd case is a 2 year old girl residing in Cho Moi district, Bac Kan
province. She developed symptoms on 2 Apr 2010. On 4 Apr 2010, she was
transferred to Cho Moi District Hospital for treatment where she is in a
stable condition. Confirmatory test results for influenza A (H5) were
obtained on 7 Apr 2010. The initial epidemiological investigations show
that there were sick/dead poultry at the patient's home and in the
surrounding areas. The patient's family slaughtered the sick poultry to eat.

There is no epidemiological link between these 2 cases that would indicate
human-to-human transmission.

Of the 119 cases confirmed to date in Viet Nam, 59 have been fatal.
