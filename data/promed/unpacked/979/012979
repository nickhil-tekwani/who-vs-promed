Pandemonium broke out as children from a local primary school were left ill after ingesting sweets, which allegedly contained drugs, last week.

Communications officer of Chatsworth SAPS, Cpt Cheryl Pillay, confirmed 11 children fell victim to these 'drug sweets', filling parents and teachers with panic.

"Chatsworth police are appealing to parents and pupils to be cautious while at school. Police have been to the school where pupils were cautioned on purchasing sweets from fellow schoolmates and strangers. We are advising parents to take precautions in this regard. Children must be aware of what drug sweets are and what these do to children. Should a child consume these sweets, it could result in serious health conditions with symptoms including nervousness, dry mouth, dilated pupils, and extreme energy followed by fatigue," explained Cpt Pillay.

If you notice your child is experiencing these symptoms, you should seek help immediately.

Chatsworth police will continue to monitor the pupils at school, however, a shared responsibility rests upon parents and teachers.

[This suspiciously sounds like a street drug known to South Africans as Strawberry Quick. It is often sold by "sweet vendors" who are frequently found around the schools. Strawberry Quick is a combination of sugar, food coloring, flavors and crystal meth. Symptoms are reported to include chattiness, nervousness, dry mouth, dilated pupils, extreme energy followed by chronic fatigue, paranoia, jaw clenching, increased heart rate, excessive sweating, increased libido, and in severe cases may include hallucinations. There may also be direct effects on the heart, circulation, and neurological systems.

Some sweet concoctions may include amphetamines, alone or in combination with the meth. If amphetamines are the only drug (no crystal meth) then clinical signs may show an increase in heart rate, palpitations, sweating, nervousness, possible hallucinations and even convulsions.

The combination of crystal meth and ampehtamines could be deadly to children, and possibly adults. The child's smaller size means the dose of drugs is potentially more toxic and detrimental to the child.

The Anti Drug Alliance SA [South Africa, also known as ADA-SA] encourages parents to teach children never to accept sweets from anyone other than their family and to never accept or purchase sweets from street vendors. The Anti Drug Alliance SA also encourages parents to know the drugs and their clinical signs in case a child displays signs, so they understand what is happening, where and how to seek immediate medical attention, and to be able to explain in clear terms what signs the child display. - Mod.TG
