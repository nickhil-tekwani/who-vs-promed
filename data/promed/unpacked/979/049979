A recent death in the community of Sheguiandah [Manitoulin District, Ontario] from the rare fungal infection blastomycosis, [which] some citizens are calling avoidable, has raised considerable concern among residents about the sometimes deadly spore lurking in [Manitoulin] Island and area soil and the way it is contracted.

On [3 Jan 2015, [a woman] of Sheguiandah passed away at Health Sciences North in Sudbury. Just before her death, test results revealed that [the woman] had been suffering from the effects of blastomycosis, a fungus she would have come into contact with on her Island home and which ultimately caused her death.

According to the website of the Sudbury and District Health Unit (SDHU), "blastomycosis (blasto) is a rare fungal infection caused by breathing in a fungus (_Blastomyces dermatitidis_), which is found in wood and damp soil. Exposure may also occur by getting the fungus on a skin scrape or cut."

In a telephone interview with Burgess Hawkins, manager, environmental health, with the SDHU, The Expositor learned that the blasto hot zones for Ontario include the Great Lakes (and Manitoulin) with Kenora as the main hot spot for Ontario. Cases have also been reported as far north as Chapleau.

As the disease is not communicable (able to be spread from one person to another) blasto is no longer reportable, Mr Hawkins explained, noting that the SDHU does not have numbers on cases but had heard about the death of [the patient] "through the grapevine."

Blasto, he continued, is [caused by] a fungus or mould that grows best in soil with high organic content (rotten wood or vegetation) and low pH levels.

"It's extremely hard to find," Mr Hawkins said. "When we test, we rarely find it," he added, noting that it is extremely hard to culture the spores in a lab as the requirements for it to live are very specific. "Island soil is slightly acidic, there are lots of trees and vegetation so it could grow without a problem."

After numerous cases of blasto in Chapleau in recent years, the medical officer of health for the area tried to conduct a study with soil samples taken from each of the suspected contract areas, but did not succeed once.

Once a person comes into contact with [the fungus], the incubation period is large, Mr Hawkins explained, from 3 weeks to 3.5 months, before an infected person begins to exhibit symptoms.

While you can contract blasto from open sores or cuts, it is rare; it is most often contracted by breathing in the fungal spores. It cannot be contracted through the water table, the SDHU assures, and this is something Northeast Town CAO Dave Williamson wants Northeast Town residents, including those in Sheguiandah, to know as well.

"There is no possibility that blastomycosis could be found in treated water," he emphatically told The Expositor. "The treatment and process is designed to meet provincial standards. Blastomycosis is a fungal spore found in soil. There is no risk of blasto from drinking water from a treated system." A rumour in the Northeast Town following [the patient's] unfortunate death was suggesting blasto could be contracted through drinking water.

Mr Williamson said his office has fielded several calls from anxious residents and events coordinator Heidi Ferguson has already been in contact with the SDHU to hold a public information session on blastomycosis in the spring "to mitigate these concerns."

Mr Hawkins said blasto is "extremely difficult" to diagnose as the symptoms are varied and wide and include a persistent cough, muscle aches, joint pain, tiredness, chills, low-grade fever, skin sores, or unexplained weight loss. The diagnosis can be made from a sample of saliva, pus from skin lesions or urine, depending on the symptoms. The risk of getting blasto is low, but those with weakened immune systems should be aware, the SDHU urges.

"These symptoms are really generic and blasto is reasonably rare," Mr Hawkins added. "It's not one (disease) you think of right off the top. But there is a test for it, and there is treatment for it."

"If you have these pneumonia-like symptoms, mention that you live in an area with blasto," he added. "An Island doctor would likely be more aware of it."

He noted that the SDHU has released information sheets to Manitoulin doctors twice over the last 2 years.

"Farmers, forestry workers, hunters, and cottagers may be exposed at wooded sites after disturbance of contaminated soil," the SDHU website states. "About half of people exposed to (blasto) will develop mild to severe illness."

Mr Hawkins suggests using caution when working in confined areas with rotted wood and keeping track of time and dates. Wearing an N100 mask, gloves, and a long-sleeved shirt is also suggested.

[Blastomycosis is a potentially fatal infection caused by the soil-based dimorphic fungus _Blastomyces dermatitidis_, which exists in the environment at ambient temperature as a mold and the animal host at body temperature as a yeast. Fungal spores may be inhaled and initiate a lung infection, which if untreated may disseminate to the skin, bone, joints, urinary tract, prostate, and brain. Many infected remain asymptomatic. This disease more commonly affects people involved with outdoor activities and the symptoms may be more severe in people with a weakened immune system.

The infection is endemic throughout much of the Midwestern USA, including the area on both sides of the Great Lakes and the St Lawrence River valley, to involve the Canadian provinces of Manitoba, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Quebec, New Brunswick, and Ontario. Blastomycosis is said to be more common (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11981725) and more severe in Native Americans (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/20/11/13-1175_article), but this may be confounded by residence of Native Americans in endemic regions and their lack of quality or accessible medical care. Further discussion of blastomycosis can be found in the moderators' comments in prior ProMED-mail posts listed below.

The Great Lakes of North America are a series of interconnected freshwater lakes (Lakes Erie, Huron, Michigan, Ontario, and Superior) located in the Midwest and northeastern North America, on the Canada-United States border, which connect to the Atlantic Ocean via the Saint Lawrence River.

The patient who died of blastomycosis resided in Sheguiandah, a native American (First Nation) settlement on Manitoulin Island, according to the news report above (http://search.211north.ca/record/TBY1912). Sheguiandah has a total registered population of 333 (http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1357840942134/1360164774416). Manitoulin is a district in northeastern Ontario that consists of Manitoulin Island (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manitoulin_Island), as well as a number of smaller islands surrounding it, and is located in the northern part of Lake Huron. It is separated from the city of Sudbury and Sudbury District on the mainland by the North Channel. Manitoulin Island is connected to the mainland by ferry service and a one-lane bridge that crosses the North Channel. Northeast Town is one of 2 incorporated towns on the island. The city of Sudbury has a population 160 274 in 2011. Chapleau is a town with a population of 2116 in Sudbury District, 450 km (280 mi) northeast of Manitoulin Island on the mainland of Ontario, where 'numerous' cases of blastomycosis were said in the news report above to have been reported. Kenora, said in the news report above to be the blastomycosis 'hot spot' in Ontario, is a large district in northwestern Ontario that borders Hudson Bay to the north and the Canadian province of Manitoba to the west.
