H5N1 human infection reaches Cairo
----------------------------------
The 1st 2 human infection cases in Cairo were announced yesterday
[Tue 4 Mar 2009].

A 32-year-old woman and her 55-year-old mother were infected by H5N1
[avian influenza virus] from the domestic poultry they used to raise.
They live in the Sahal area in Cairo. They were transferred to
hospital and were found to be H5N1 positive. Hopefully they will be
cured.

[If confirmed officially by the Egyptian Ministry of Health and
Population, these 2 cases will bring the total number of human avian
H5N1 influenza cases in Egypt to 58, with the number of fatalities
remaining 23.
