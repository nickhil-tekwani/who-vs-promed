Owners of snakes and lizards should take precautions when feeding them
frozen rodents, which may be contaminated with salmonella, the Public
Health Agency of Canada says. The agency says 7 cases of human illness
have been reported in Canada between April 2010 and August 2010 caused
by a strain of _Salmonella_ linked to frozen rodents. The agency did
not identify any particular producer. Food for cats and dogs can also
carry salmonella.

The agency recommends:
- Always washing hands thoroughly with soap and water after feeding,
handling, or cleaning up after pet reptiles and their food products.
- Cleaning surfaces that come into contact with reptiles or their food.
- Sealing frozen reptile food products in a plastic bag and placing in
a covered garbage can.

The Public Health Agency said it is investigating with provincial and
territorial counterparts whether this outbreak is associated with a
similar illness in the USA and if a product implicated in a USA
outbreak was distributed in Canada.

[The recently reported outbreak of _S. enterica_ isolates I
4,[5],12:i:- also referred to as _S._ Typhimurium DT191A, occurred in
the USA and in UK. It is certainly possible that the same strain was
found in the Canadian cases.

As a review, discussed by Ana Paccagnella (supervisor of the Enteric
Bacteriology Section at the British Columbia Centre for Disease
Control),
<http://www.bcfpa.net/Attachments/Presentations/Conference2005/Naming%20Salmonella%20(A%20Paccagnella)%2008%20Nov%2005.pdf>:

_Salmonella_ as a genus has 2 species, _enterica_ and _bongori_. _S.
enterica_ is divided into 6 subspecies: _enterica_, _salamae_,
_arizonae_, _diarizonae_, _houtenae_, and _indica_. _S. enterica_
subspecies _enterica_ (or subspecies I) strains are the ones usually
isolated from humans or warm-blooded animals and represent a majority
of the salmonellas that are clinically important.

The designation _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- means:
- the "I" reflects subspecies _enterica_;
- the "4, [5], 12" are the O (or somatic) antigens associated with the
organism; it should be noted that serotype Typhimurium carries somatic
antigens 4, 5, and 12 (the Group B antigens).
Paccagnella pointed out to me in an e-mail that an O antigen
underscored or placed in [ ] can refer to whether the antigen is
related to phage conversion or not.
- the nomenclature after the colon, in this case i:-, reflects the
flagellar or H antigens. It is these H antigens that define the
serotype identity within an individual group of salmonellas.

Almost all of these organisms are biphasic in regard to the H
antigens, that is, they can switch from 1 flagellar antigen to
another. As an example, _S._ Typhimurium is I 4, 5, 12:i:1,2. The
outbreak organism here, however, is monophasic. This monophasic strain
appears to be such due to the absence of the _flj_B gene, which is
involved in the H antigen switching mechanism.

According to Paccagnella, around 1903 Smith and Reagh reported on the
different behavior of the flagellar and somatic antigens of salmonella
strains. Their work was mostly ignored until Weil and Felix, working
on _Proteus_ cultures, noted 2 forms, the swarming form called the H
form (_mit Hauch_, in English: with breath] and the non-swarming form,
called the O form (_ohne Hauch_, in English: without breath). The H
form contained both O and H antigens (correctly termed the OH form).
These parallels were transposed to the salmonella antigens.

If O antiserum is added to a culture, motility is preserved whereas if
H antiserum is added the culture does not move. Therefore, H antigen
was involved with swarming in the agar plate (breathing might have
been used to imply the ability to move). (Salmonellas, of course, do
not swarm on certain agar plates like _Proteus_ do.) - Mod.LL]
