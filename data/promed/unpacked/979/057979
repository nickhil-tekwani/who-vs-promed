South Korea's Ministry for Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries
says it is gaining the upper hand in the battle against a highly
contagious animal disease. The outbreak has decimated the country's
livestock and cost farmers more than USD one billion in the past
month-and-a-half.

Officials say only a few new cases of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD]
have been reported in the past several days. But the outbreak has
overwhelmed veterinarians and public officials. Farmers say it will
take years to recover financially.

Nearly 1.7 million animals have been destroyed so far. South Korea,
before the culling began, had a total 10 million swine and 3 million cattle.

Animal rights activists say most of the pigs and cows ordered
destroyed have been buried alive.

Lee Won-bok, the president of South Korea's Association for Animal
Protection, says culling in this manner is illegal and inhumane, but
those in the industry do not seem to have any compassion. He has been
demanding authorities cease live burials and keep the number of
animals culled to minimum.

Lee says he witnessed pigs being flung into 5-meter deep pits,
causing injuries before they eventually died of suffocation. He says
he has been hearing the squeals of their suffering echoing in his
ears for more than 2 weeks.

Lee Byoung-guan is the deputy director of the National Veterinary
Research and Quarantine Service. He says central government
authorities never ordered live burials.

Lee says it appears local authorities made their own decisions to
kill the animals in this manner.

The government veterinarian predicts that, as a result of widespread
quarantine and aggressive vaccinations, the number of cases should be
minimized by the end of this month [January 2011].

There has been criticism about the delay in ordering mass
vaccinations. One factor, critics say, is that it has been quicker
and cheaper to kill the animals than to vaccinate them.

Another factor is that blood tests cannot distinguish between
infected and vaccinated livestock. That would prevent livestock from
being exported until South Korea could be re-designated as
disease-free by the World Organisation for Animal Health [OIE].

South Korea's president on Sunday [16 Jan 2011] traveled to the east
of the capital, Seoul, to inspect quarantine activities against FMD.
Lee Myung-bak called on civil servants to do whatever it takes to
halt the spread of the disease, which also hit the country twice last
year [2010].

The scope of this outbreak is the largest yet in the country and
comes ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays next month [February
2011], during which it is traditional to give gifts of meat.

FMD, while highly infectious among cloven-hoofed animals, does not
affect humans.
