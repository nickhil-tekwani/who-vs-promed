The New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets confirmed 5 more cases of West Nile virus in 2018, according to the Equine Disease Communications Center.

A 4-year gelding from Ft. Edward (Washington County) was euthanized on 6 Sep 2018 after falling on 3 Sep 2018. A 9-year old gelding from Lyndonville (Orleans County) is recovering. A 10-year old mare from Canandaigua (Ontario County); a 5-year mare from Lowville (Lewis County), and an 18-year old gelding from Eden (Erie County) are all recovering.

All are under veterinary oversight but not under quarantine.

Three equine cases have been reported in Pennsylvania and one in New Jersey.

Horse owners are encouraged to vaccinate their horses and reduce standing water on their farms to reduce mosquito breeding sites.

[The vaccine to prevent West Nile virus is very effective. Vaccination is cheap compared to treating the disease. Vaccination is easy on the horse and the owner vs the cost of treatment and the stress on the horse and the caretaker/owners. Please vaccinate your horses if you have not already done so. - Mod.TG
