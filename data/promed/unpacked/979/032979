Mysterious malady kills 100 geese
---------------------------------
Wildlife experts suspect avian cholera, a bacterial infection, may be
responsible for the deaths of an estimated 100 Canada geese at 3 lakes in
the western Denver suburbs. They hope tests under way at a Colorado
Division of Wildlife facility in Fort Collins will show what killed the geese.
"The bottom line is we're not certain," said Wildlife Division spokesman
Todd Malmsbury. "The initial examinations did not suggest poison. But
since we can't say what it is, we can't rule that out."
Geese have been turning up dead since early January in the western
suburbs, but in the last week, the deaths have increased dramatically,
officials said.
About 50 carcasses were removed in the past few days from Jefferson
County's Crown Hill Open Space Park. Others were retrieved from a private
pond in Wheat Ridge and from Kendrick Lake in Lakewood.
Officials said they don't know why the deaths are concentrated in the
western suburbs.
"It seems at this point to be pretty isolated, but that could change,"
said district wildlife manager Jerrie McKee.
Experts say avian cholera is most likely to occur where people are
feeding geese and ducks, because it causes the waterfowl to congregate
and lets the disease spread more rapidly.
McKee said so far the malady has affected only Canada geese and not the
ducks sharing the same lakes.
Avian cholera isn't believed to be a problem for humans, but authorities
caution they do not know what killed the geese.
Depending on the strain, there is a possibility it could be passed to
other animals, McKee warned.
