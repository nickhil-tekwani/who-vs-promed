In response to Dr. Aldis suggestions, it was my impression that the well
established WHO Collaborating Influenza Laboratory Network (which includes
three strategically placed influenza reference laboratories) had addressed
all these suggestions. It would appear, however, that the long delays in
characterization of this strain and the lack of officially reported
information point to "cracks in the Net."
