CJD (NEW VARIANT), YOUNGEST HUMAN CASE - UK

A 13-year-old girl may, according to this story, be the youngest victim of
the human form of mad cow disease (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy or BSE
in cattle and new variant or variant Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease, nvCJD, in
people). The girl, whose identity and whereabouts are being kept secret,
is, thought to be displaying symptoms of new variant Creutzfeldt Jakob
Disease. If the case is confirmed it has major implications. It raises the
question of whether the girl was infected by baby food, and may shed light
on the disease's incubation period. The girl was less than a year old in
1986 when BSE, the cattle disease thought to manifest itself in humans as
the new variant form of CJD, was formally identified.
Three years later the Government banned parts of the cow most likely to be
infected, such as the brain and spinal cord, from human food products. So
far the youngest of the 48 people to have died from nvCJD has been 16.
David Churchill, chairman of the support group the Human BSE Foundation,
was cited as saying he was aware of the case, adding, "I can confirm the
story is true - the girl is showing symptoms of the disease. This case
raises a whole new specter. There's no way anyone can say this child picked
up nvCJD prior to knowledge about BSE. Back in 1986 BSE was not only
identified, but becoming prevalent. It can only have been picked up after
the emergence of BSE, and the likelihood is that it was through baby food.
The ability to diagnose this illness from its symptoms is improving with
each case, and there are some fairly clear diagnostic guidelines now. The
chances of a misdiagnosis, or missed diagnosis, are less likely than they
used to be." Although the disease could only be confirmed for certain after
death, the girl was showing signs and behaviour known to be linked with
nvCJD. Heather Paine, spokeswoman for the Infant and Dietetic Foods
Association, was cited as saying as far as she knew no high-risk beef
material, such as mechanically recovered meat stripped off the spine, had
ever been used in baby products, adding, "To my knowledge no MRM from
cattle has ever been put in baby food. Manufacturers are very aware of what
mothers want to feed their babies." At one-year-old the girl would probably
have been weaned off commercial baby food and eating home-prepared meals
which may have included mince and beef cuts, said Ms Paine.
