A life-threatening West Nile virus outbreak is sweeping through Italy via mosquitos, with one death and 11 other infections already reported. Authorities are struggling to contain the infection, with 3 areas -- Jesolo, Caorle, and Ceggia -- already testing positive for the virus. All 3 areas had already been decontaminated, meaning the outbreaks are moving faster than tests and disinfestations.

A 77-year-old man died yesterday [Sun 29 Jul 2018] after he contracted an infected mosquito bite in Cento, near Bologna in northern Italy. The man had originally been admitted to the hospital for a fall on Tuesday [24 Jul 2018], but his condition deteriorated, and he was transferred to a specialist hospital 60 miles [96.6 km] away in Cona, where he was diagnosed with West Nile meningoencephalitis. He died 4 days later.

The West Nile virus has no symptoms in 75 percent of cases. But those who do show signs suffer flu-like symptoms, with a fever, headache, vomiting, and a rash. In the worst of cases, the virus can develop into meningitis or encephalitis, causing seizures and confusion. If the infection reaches the nervous system, it can cause death in 10 percent of cases.

The 12th person to be infected by the virus, in the eastern Veneto region, saw small bubbles erupt all over her body and experienced headache and joint pains 2 days ago [Sat 28 Jul 2018]. The mayor of Fossalta di Piave, in the Venice area, has ordered a "massive disinfestation" throughout the area after the 53-year-old woman tested positive for the infection. The woman managed to stop the infection becoming any more dangerous by spotting symptoms early.

Pier Giorgio Scotton, expert in infectious diseases in the Italian city of Treviso, said, "She went to the doctor and said, 'Could it be the West Nile?' And she was immediately tested. Their suspicion was founded."

The woman was taken to the hospital immediately, where she is now out of danger and recovering. "She was always lucid and present," Scotton said. "She will still need a few days to say that the most difficult phase is over."

It is not known where the infected mosquito was, as the woman had travelled in the Jesolo and Eraclea areas. It is also difficult to identify where infected mosquitos are, as incubation periods vary among people from 2 days to 2 weeks. And mosquitos travel between towns within just a few hours.

Massimo Sensini, mayor of Fossalta, ordered a decontamination of the town, including private areas. "Weaker subjects, who could be more exposed to the problem, can rest assured," he said. "I still invite the population to protect themselves from mosquito bites, particularly outside houses, with suitable repellents and clothing."

[According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) update, between 20 and 26 Jul 2018, 20 cases of human West Nile fever were reported in Italy (https://ecdc.europa.eu/en/west-nile-fever/surveillance-and-disease-data/disease-data-ecdc). The continuous evidence of West Nile virus circulation in the country, and indeed the European region, highlights the importance of having rigorous entomological and veterinary surveillance plans in place and of establishing close cooperation among the different players in the health field. - Mod.UBA

Two new cases of West Nile virus were recorded in Central Macedonia, bringing the total for the region to 6, the state-run Athens-Macedonian news agency reported on [Tue 31 Jul 2018].

From the start of the summer season, 22 cases of the virus have been reported by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KEELPNO) throughout the country, based on the last data it published on [Thu 26 Jul 2018].

"Two people are being treated in hospital for precautionary reasons," Dimitris Hatzivrettas, the deputy regional governor for Central Macedonia, responsible for public health, told the Athens News Agency - Macedonian Press Agency (ANA-MPA).

Hatzivrettas said the other 4 patients have been discharged and are in good health.
