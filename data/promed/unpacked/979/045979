The number of laboratory-confirmed flu cases has increased almost
7-fold this year [2011].

A Queensland Health spokeswoman said the number of flu cases in
Central Queensland and Central West districts had reached 306 by 8 Aug
2011. It is a dramatic increase compared to the number of cases for
the same period last year [2010], which was 45. That figure is only
the number of laboratory-confirmed cases. The spokeswoman said for the
past 5 years for that period, the districts had averaged 161 flu
cases, including the pandemic in 2009.

The Central Queensland News reported on 3 Aug 2011 that employers were
penalising staff who took time off work when they were diagnosed with
the flu. "Most people we're seeing with this flu are between 15 and
35, and there have been some very sick people requiring admission to
hospital," one Emerald GP told Central Queensland News.

"A recurring theme is employers demanding their sick workers come to
work and run the risk of infecting others. I have heard of one person
who has been fired for not turning up when ill with this flu, and
several have received criticism from their supervisors about
absenteeism. It would be more sensible for employers to vaccinate all
their workers early than wait for the flu season to hit."

Although Queensland Health would not specifically acknowledge swine
flu among the 224 lab-confirmed cases of influenza in the central
region this year [2011], most of the cases in the Emerald area are
believed to be H1N1.

According to the Queensland Health website, symptoms usually appear
one to 3 days after being infected. A person can spread influenza to
others a day or 2 before they become unwell and up to 5 days after
they have become unwell for adults and even longer for young children.
Most people recover within a week.

[According to the most recent WHO Influenza Update, released on 15 Jul
2011,
http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/latest_update_GIP_surveillance/en/index.html,
in Australia, the [southern hemisphere influenza] season appeared to
have started with notable increases in influenza-like illness (ILI)
consultations and confirmed cases. The most common virus detected
nationally in Australia was influenza A(H1N1)2009, though this is not
consistent in every state.

This report indicates that Queensland is particularly badly affected
and that the predominant virus is probably the influenza A/(H1N1) 2009
strain.
