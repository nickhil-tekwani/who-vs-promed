West Nile Virus: Blood Screening Deficiency
-------------------------------------------
Federal health officials said this year's West Nile season has
revealed weaknesses in a test used to screen the country's blood
supply for the disease, and that the illness has caused nearly 24
cases of paralysis among previously healthy adults. This year's
outbreak of the mosquito-borne illness, which has been particularly
bad in the Great Plains and some western states, has infected
5861 people and killed 115 [6507 and 136 as of 8 Oct 2003 -
Mod.CP].
Officials of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on
Thu 2 Oct 2003 that a screening test used since July [2003] cannot
detect all donated blood units infected with the virus. The
government said the test has potentially protected thousands of
people, flagging 617 infected blood donors. But the test, which
screens samples in a pool of multiple blood units, loses its
sensitivity in the diluted mix. "We catch most of the infected people,
but not all of them," said Dr. Lyle Petersen, acting director of the
CDC's division of vector-borne diseases. Testing individual blood
units catches more infections but may be too costly, with an annual
cost of US$300 million, Petersen said. False positives from
screening individual units of blood may mean the blood industry
would have to throw out "tens of thousands of units of blood that
are probably OK," he added.

West Nile Virus-associated Polio-like Paralysis
-----------------------------------------------
Nearly 24 patients in northern Colorado have developed polio-like
paralysis from the virus. [So far in 2003 about 32 percent of all
confirmed human cases of West Nile virus infection have occurred
in the state of Colorado. - Mod.CP] Paralysis was first noted as a
West Nile symptom [in 2002] [see: "West Nile virus, acute flaccid
paralysis - USA 20020919.5359". - Mod.CP], but only a few cases
were reported.
"We're recognizing a lot more of these cases -- we're kind of
surprised to find this many," said Dr. Lyle Petersen, acting director
of the CDC's division of vector-borne diseases, at the University of
California's Berkeley campus.
The paralysis, Petersen said, "looks exactly the same as polio."
The CDC is working to investigate how many more cases of
paralysis, which has struck otherwise healthy adults in their 40s
and 50s, have emerged in this year's West Nile epidemic. Many of
those afflicted had to be placed on respirators. Petersen did not
say whether any died.
CDC officials also noted that people with weakened immune
systems, such as those who are taking drugs to suppress the
immune system after a kidney transplant, are up to 10 times more
likely to develop severe West Nile symptoms than a healthy
person, Petersen said. The virus is passed to people by bites of
mosquitoes that have fed on infected birds. Most of the time, the
virus causes mild, flu-like symptoms, but in serious cases, the virus
can cause a deadly inflammation of the brain.
CDC officials estimate up to 100 000 people are infected with mild
symptoms, most of which do not result in a doctor's visit. Another
400 000 people are infected but never show any symptoms.

Washington: Reduction in Cases of West Nile virus Infection at
National Zoo
--------------------------------------------------------
The Washington Post reports that zoo officials have seen a
significant drop in cases of the disease among its captive
population. Wild birds who frequent the zoo seem to be doing
better, too. Of the 20 birds tested from the zoo's captive collection,
none were infected. And only 8 of 32 wild birds tested carried the
virus. That compares to 81 infected zoo and wild birds discovered
in 2002. This year's testing will continue through December [2003].
Zoo officials tell the Post that one reason for the drop-off in cases
could be that birds are building up a natural immunity to the disease.

South Dakota: Great horned Owl Survives West Nile Virus Infection
--------------------------------------------------
A Great Horned Owl that was treated for West Nile virus has
recovered and will be released back into the wild within a month. A
motorist found the owl along a country road in September 2002,
and brought it to the Great Plains Zoo and Delbridge Museum of
Natural History. The zoo is a federally licensed wildlife rehabilitation
center, said Tom Ness, the zoo's supervisor of animal care.
"When we first got him, we thought he had a broken wing because
he wouldn't fly," Ness said. "He was dehydrated. And then he
couldn't hold up his head because of the encephalitis. He was
losing muscle control." The bird was extremely weak and had to be
hand-fed at first, said Scott Voss, animal care specialist in the
zoo's bird department. " He was scarcely aware of our presence --
because of the delirium -- for several weeks," Voss said. The
lethargy and loss of muscle control led to the West Nile diagnosis,
said Ness.
Three Great Horned Owls, a bald eagle, and a couple of arctic
waterfowl died from the virus during summer of 2003 at the zoo. In
2002, the zoo lost 15 or 16 animals to West Nile virus infection,
said Ness.

Rhode Island: 1st Equine Cases of West Nile Virus Infection
-------------------------------------------------------------
2 horses in Washington County have tested positive for West Nile
virus, the state Department of Environmental Management (DEM)
reported. The horses, from Hope Valley in Hopkinton and Carolina
in Charlestown, are the 1st in the state to test positive for the
mosquito-transmitted disease, The Providence Journal reported.
They became ill during September 2003 and were tested by state
officials. The Hope Valley horse is the first West Nile case in
Hopkinton, officials said. The DEM previously reported a mosquito
sample from Burlingame State Park tested positive for the virus.
"The results are not unexpected, since West Nile virus is prevalent
throughout the state," DEM spokeswoman Gail Mastrati said.
Meanwhile, a horse in Westerly is recovering from Eastern equine
encephalitis (EEE). 2 horses and an emu have died from the more
deadly mosquito-transmitted disease, according to the DEM. So far
in 2003, the state has reported 11 EEE virus-positive mosquito
samples and 6 West Nile virus-positive mosquito samples. The
only other animals to contract West Nile have been birds,
according to DEM.
3 Rhode Islanders have also become infected with West Nile virus,
but all are recovering, according to Dr. John Fulton, associate
director of disease prevention for the Health Department.
Mosquitoes infected with West Nile virus and EEE virus are still
present in every community in the state, officials said. It typically
takes a hard frost to kill the insects, according to Alan Gettman, the
state's mosquito abatement coordinator. If temperatures increase,
the mosquitoes could return. Last week, state officials encouraged
local schools and recreational organizations to limit outdoor
activities.

ProMED-mail

[As of Wed 8 Oct 2003, in the USA only 4 states -- Hawaii, Alaska,
Nevada, and Oregon -- remain entirely free of West Nile virus
infection of any animal species (apart from travel-related human
cases) since the appearance of the virus in North America.
The weekly counts of new human cases during the past 5 weeks
have been 414, 1046, 1214, 690, 1034, and now 646. The 3
western/midwestern states of Colorado, Nebraska, and South
Dakota have accounted for 62.4 percent (4061/6507) of the total
number of confirmed human cases in 2003.
Dr P. Joseph Gibson (Director of Epidemiology, the Health &
Hospital Corporation of Marion County, Indianapolis) has sent the
following interesting comment to ProMED-mail relevant to
interpretation of the above statistics:
"The greater incidence of human WNV case reporting in the states
just east of the Rockies, relative to the more eastern states, may
have to do with changes in surveillance. In Indiana [during 2002],
we had very active surveillance, with the public health system
actively gathering blood draws from MD offices, and having them
tested for WNV. The benefit of that was questionable, given that
knowing someone's virus is WNV does not change the treatment
plan. [In 2003 thus far], monitoring is far less aggressive. States
that are new to WNV may have much more thorough surveillance,
whereas states with a year or 2 of experience may have much
more passive surveillance. I expect (at least I hope) that the death
reporting is fairly consistent and complete."
Although there are no data to back up Dr. Gibson's observation, it
deserves consideration and evaluation. - Mod.CP]
