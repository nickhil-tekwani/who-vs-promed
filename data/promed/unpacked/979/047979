At the discussion [involving health minister, Nimal Siripala De Silva
and provincial director of health, Dr Kapila Dangalle] it was
revealed that there are between 10 000-15 000 chikungunya patients in
the Ratnapura district and that the torrential rain that prevailed in
the last few months had aggravated the situation.

President Mahinda Rajapaksa declared an emergency situation following
the sharp increase of chikungunya cases in the Ratnapura district.

There are a large number of legal and illegal gem pits in the
district. Gem miners do not refill gem pits when they abandon them,
creating easy breeding grounds for mosquitoes, Dr Dangalle pointed
out.

The minister also instructed ministry officials to immediately send
50 doctors and 60 nurses to Ratnapura to help carry out treatment and
preventive care in the district.
