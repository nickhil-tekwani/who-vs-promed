The number of mumps cases in central Ohio rose to 361 Friday [16 May 2014] afternoon. The outbreak is in Franklin, Delaware, and Madison Counties, according to the Columbus Public Health Department.

The majority of those cases, 208, are linked to the Ohio State University. The ages of patients range from 4 months to 80 years old.

The health department is urging everyone to make sure they've had both doses of the MMR [measles mumps rubella] vaccine. Symptoms of the mumps include fever, headaches, tiredness, and swelling of the salivary glands.

[When ProMED-mail last posted the status of this mumps outbreak there were a total of 153 cases (Mumps - USA (03): (OH) update 20140409.2391429). Most cases were in Franklin County (135 cases) and linked to the Ohio State University [OSU] campus in the city of Columbus, Ohio. The city of Columbus and OSU are located in Franklin County. The outbreak subsequently spread into the surrounding counties (Delaware, Fairfield, Licking, and Union) in central Ohio. Now there are 361 cases, and most cases continue to be in Franklin County (208 cases).

The American College Health Association has recommended that colleges and universities require that students have documented receipt of 2 doses of MMR vaccine or have other acceptable evidence of measles, rubella, and mumps immunity before college enrollment (http://www.acha.org/topics/docs/CDC_ACHA_Mumps_Recommendations_Jul13.pdf). However, OSU does not mandate immunization against mumps before matriculation.

Nevertheless, mumps outbreaks among vaccinated populations have been reported frequently during recent years, especially among college students where the intensity of exposure among students presumably overcomes vaccine-induced immunity (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/20/4/13-1681_article.htm). Perhaps waning post-vaccination immunity and antigenic differences between outbreak strains and the vaccine viruses are additional explanations for mumps outbreaks in highly vaccinated populations (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/47/11/1458.full). - Mod.ML
