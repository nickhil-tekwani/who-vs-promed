One dog is dead after possibly getting poisoned at a local park. Now, 10 News is getting reports of a 2nd dog dying after visiting the same park.

The warning is posted on a hand-written flyer at the park. No one knows who put it there, but it doesn't look like the city put it there.

10 News reporter Anthony Pura spoke with one of the dog owners. She says her dog, Porky, died hours after getting home from the Grape Street Dog Park [San Diego, CA].

The 6-year-old Yorkshire Terrier died 2 days ago. His owner, who asked us to keep her name private, says the Grape Street Dog Park was the last place they visited together. Four hours after they got home, Porky started acting sick and suddenly died.

After talking to other park visitors, she thinks her dog may have eaten something dangerous. Unfortunately, she can't confirm what it was.

If you think your dog has been poisoned, the pet poison helpline says you should remove it from the area immediately. Do not attempt to treat your pet without 1st talking to a vet or specialist. If you need help, contact the pet poison helpline.

[If this owner suspected some type of poison, she should have taken her pet to a veterinarian. A necropsy of the pet would provide the stomach contents and tissue samples for laboratory analysis, which could save the life of other pets in and around the dog park. It is a difficult decision to submit your pet for a necropsy, but the information may save others as well as give you peace of mind as to what happened to your pet.

Without knowing clinical signs, it is impossible to make any rational comment on the possible toxin. - Mod.TG]

[A third dog has also reportedly died, and several others have been sickened, after visiting the park (http://www.10news.com/news/another-dog-death-possibly-tied-to-grape-st-dog-park). ProMED-mail would greatly appreciate any additional information concerning these cases including any additional history, exam, laboratory, and/or necropysy findings, etc. - Mod.JH]
