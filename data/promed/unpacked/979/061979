The Pune [Maharashtra state] city authorities have reported 33 new dengue cases in the 1st 5 days of this month [July 2014], out of which 2 cases succumbed to their illness and died during the same week.

The Pune Municipal Corporation's (PMC) health department has started collecting information on all cases from private hospitals as well.

As per the corporation's records, Pune has reported as many as 179 dengue cases from January-June this year [2014]. Pune has recorded a sizable number of cases when compared with Pimpri Chinchwad [Maharashtra state].

The 1st dengue fatality was reported in Pune city on [26 Jun 2014], when a 26-year-old man from Hadapsar [Maharashtra state] died at a private hospital. The 2nd death was a 46-year-old from New Nana Peth [Pune city] who died due to dengue shock syndrome at Sadhu Vaswani Mission Hospital around 8:50 am on [5 Jul 2014].

After relatively low activity levels for the 1st quarter of the year [2014], the mosquito-borne infection has shown a sudden rise, with cases increasing in number from 29 in May [2014] to 87 during June [2014], when an average of 2 dengue cases were recorded per day.

[Dengue virus belongs to the family Flaviviridae, having 4 serotypes that spread by the bite of infected _Aedes_ mosquitoes. It has a wide spectrum of illness from mild, asymptomatic disease to severe, fatal dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). Approximately 2.5 billion people live in dengue-risk regions with about 100 million new cases each year worldwide.

The 4 main characteristic manifestations of dengue illness are: 1) continuous high fever lasting 2-7 days, 2) hemorrhagic tendency as indicated by a positive tourniquet test, petechiae or nosebleeds (epistaxis), 3) thrombocytopoenia or a reduction in platelet counts below less than 100 x 10 to the 9th/l, and finally, 4) some evidence of plasma leakage indicated by hemo-concentration (over 20 percent increase in haematocrit levels), pleural effusion (leakage of fluid in the chest cavity) or ascites (leakage in abdominal cavity). There are 4 known dengue serotypes, designated DV-1 to DV-4 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3510884).

There is no specific treatment for dengue fever, and no vaccine is available for prevention. Supportive medical treatment and maintenance of patients' body fluid is the mainstay of medical management in cases with a clinical diagnosis that report to a health facility.

Dengue fever has been endemic in India since the 19th century; DHF was 1st reported in 1987. The 1st major widespread epidemic of DHF and DSS was reported in 1996, with all 4 serotypes reported to be in co-circulation. In 2012, a total of 47 029 dengue fever cases and 242 deaths were reported during an outbreak in India, which was up to 3 times higher than the previous year (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23780868).

Even though the disease has been endemic to the country for many decades now, the increasing geographic spread of the disease and its vector (_Aedes aegypti_) present a continuous challenge to public health authorities. Vector control is known to be an effective preventive method in vector borne diseases, including dengue. Use of anti-larval substances such as dieldrin, malathion, and temephos are quite effective in controlling the mosquito larvae, but emergence of resistance remains a constant issue. Other anti-vector compounds that have been used with variable efficiency include plant-based repellents, flavonoids, ethyl acetate, methanol chloroform and nano-silica against this mosquito species.

A study in India by Mani et al (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16359411) evaluated the efficacy of indoor and outdoor or peri-domestic thermal fog applications of a pyrethroid mixture against adult populations of _Aedes aegypti_. The study data indicated that the knockdown and killing effect was superior when fogging was applied inside houses rather than around them. However, outdoor thermal fogging was found to reduce the resting and biting populations by 76 percent and 40 percent, respectively, for up to 3 days after treatment, whereas indoor fogging suppressed adult populations for 5 days.

Dengue remains one of the major public health problems which can be controlled with active participation of the community. Health education programs about dengue need to be organized in order to increase community knowledge and also to sensitize the community to participate in integrated vector control programs. - Mod.UBA]

[2] Myanmar (Yangon)

An outbreak of dengue fever has hit Yangon, particularly suburban areas, with most victims of the mosquito-borne illness being school children, according to the Yangon regional health department.

The exact number of patients in all private and public hospitals is not yet known, but at least 654 patients have been treated so far this year [2014], of which 5 have died, health officials said. Preventive measures have been implemented at all schools in Yangon Region to contain the outbreak, but the number of patients is rising, they said.

Dengue fever peaks during monsoon season, as the mosquito that spreads the virus is more prevalent. Symptoms include fever, joint ache, headache, sleeplessness and fatigue. If the disease progresses into dengue hemorrhagic fever, it can cause internal bleeding and shock, which can be fatal.

"June, July and August are the dengue fever outbreak period," a health official said. Because these months occur during the school year, the dengue virus can spread from one student to another if a mosquito that bites an infected student bites another. "We need to be very cautious this year [2014] about dengue due to the outbreak last year [2013], which was a catastrophe," the official said.

Poor sanitation and an abundance of breeding spaces for the mosquito that spreads the virus are considered factors in dengue outbreaks. Unlike the mosquito that transmits malaria, the dengue mosquito bites during the day. Health officials advise that parents seek immediate treatment for children who appear to have dengue symptoms, such as fever, aches, sleeplessness or fatigue.

[According to the above media report, an outbreak of dengue fever has hit Yangon, particularly suburban areas.

Last year (2013), data collected from clinics and hospitals showed that 6448 people have been infected with the mosquito-borne virus so far, and 13 patients have died, and in 2012, the Ministry recorded 6033 dengue cases and 27 deaths. The most deadly dengue outbreak was recorded by the Ministry in 1994, when 444 people died of the virus, while a 2001 epidemic killed 204 patients (http://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/burma-faces-dengue-fever-outbreak-officials).

The arrival of the 1st rains has brought dengue fever infections, and in Yangon, some children have been diagnosed with symptoms of dengue fever due to the 1st rains and catching dengue fever from the mosquitoes.

Dengue is a serious and growing public health problem in Southeast Asia. Dengue has primarily been thought of as an urban public health problem because the disease-causing mosquito vector is so well adapted to human habitation. Generally, Yangon seems to have the largest number of cases, as the mosquito that carries dengue breeds well in urban and semi-urban locations.

Health officials are taking measures to mitigate the risks, including running public awareness campaigns on how to prevent and control the disease. The focus is on the hygienic use of drinking water, combating larvae, weekend sanitation activities, and education on dengue fever.
