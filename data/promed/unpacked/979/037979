Study Uses Math Model to Determine Effects of a Smallpox Attack
----------------------------
A new study finds large differences in how 4 different vaccination
strategies would fight a smallpox terror attack, with the best resulting in
440 deaths and the worst 110 000 deaths.
The study used a mathematical model to compare how an attack on a large
city that infected 1000 people would progress when countered with diverse
vaccination plans meant to halt the spread of the highly contagious disease.
In all cases, the mass vaccination of the United States population worked
far better than limited local immunizations, a strategy the federal
government has tended to prefer.
"We find that mass vaccination results in both far fewer deaths and much
faster epidemic eradication," the authors conclude. In the best case, the
epidemic was stopped in 115 days and in the worst 350 days.
The new analysis is being published this week in the online edition of
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Its authors are Edward H.
Kaplan, a public health specialist at Yale University, and David L. Craft
and Lawrence M. Wein, both of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Ever since smallpox was eradicated from human populations decades ago,
federal officials have resisted mass vaccination because the vaccine uses a
live virus that can cause severe side effects and even kill. In the days of
wide vaccination, roughly one person in a million died.
But federal policy is in flux because of fears of bioterrorism. Although
today only Russia and the United States have declared stocks of the virus,
experts say clandestine supplies probably exist.
Most people are now considered vulnerable because immunity is thought to
wane over time. The United States stopped routine vaccinations in
1972. Smallpox kills roughly 1 in 3 victims who are unvaccinated.
Vaccination can save even infected people because the vaccine, if given
within 4 days of exposure to the virus, halts the disease's advance.
The new study, coming amid rising criticism of federal policy in recent
months, claims to be the first to make detailed comparisons of the
vaccination options. It is an elaboration of a preliminary presentation
that Dr. Kaplan gave at a federal meeting in Washington on 15 Jun 2002.
The study found the least effective method to be "ring vaccination," the
main way smallpox was eradicated from human populations. It consists of
isolating infected patients and vaccinating people found to be in close
contact with them, forming a ring of immunization around any outbreak and a
barrier to its further spread.
In the hypothetical attack, ring vaccination resulted in 367 000 cases of
smallpox and 110 000 deaths and took 350 days to extinguish the outbreak.
By contrast, mass vaccinations carried out as soon as authorities became
aware of the attack (smallpox takes roughly 2 weeks to incubate in the body
and show symptoms) would result in 1830 cases and 560 deaths over a period
of 115 days.
The study found that if the authorities were overwhelmed and decided
belatedly to switch from ring to mass vaccination on the 33rd day of the
crisis, the fatalities would still be quite high 15 570 cases and 4680 deaths.
"The cost of waiting," the authors said, "is very high 4120 incremental
deaths."
The study found that the vaccination of the United States population before
an attack worked best of all to cut fatalities.
If only 40 percent of the population were immunized beforehand, the same
attack followed by wider mass vaccinations would produce 440 deaths. But if
followed with ring vaccinations, the result would be 40 000 deaths.
"We believe that unless pre-attack vaccination is used," the authors
conclude, serious consideration should be given to dropping federal plans
for ring vaccination in favor of mass immunizations "in the event of a
smallpox attack in a large urban center."

[Because the study referred to in this article was not yet available on
line, it is prudent to withhold comment, other than it will be very
interesting to see the study and the actual analyses and premises on which
the analyses are based. As an aside, if there were to be an aerosolized
release of the smallpox virus in a well-circumscribed geographic area, a
mass campaign for vaccination of the entire population in the affected area
is a form of "ring vaccination" -- viewing the geographic area as "the
case" to vaccinate a ring around -- a semantic issue. - Mod.MPP]
