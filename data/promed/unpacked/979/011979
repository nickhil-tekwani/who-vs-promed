More Black Sigatoka found in Queensland
---------------------------------------
Another outbreak of Black Sigatoka has been detected on a banana farm within
the quarantine zone in north Queensland. It was found on a non-commercial
farm, [7 km from the site of the original find last week.
The news comes at the same time as Government plant health authorities
agreed to let interstate fruit movements resume from within a 50 km
quarantine zone around the site.
The chair of the Australian Banana Growers Council, Vicki Kippen O'Connor,
says the latest detection isn't a great concern. [She said that [the
outbreak is still within the 7.5 km zone and [no other diseased banana
plants have been detected.

[It is possible that other infection centers may arise within the quarantine
zone. Plans to resume shipping of fruit from that zone may have to be
reconsidered. - Mod.DH
