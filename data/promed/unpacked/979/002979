Authorities in a city in the Chinese region of Inner Mongolia have quarantined a village after a resident there who had caught an intestinal type of plague died, the health commission of the city said on Thu 6 Aug 2020.

Cases of plague are not uncommon in China, although outbreaks have become increasingly rare. From 2009 to 2018, China reported 26 cases and 11 deaths.

Baotou city has sealed off the village where the dead patient lived and quarantined the patient's close contacts, who have tested negative for the disease so far and taken preventive medicines, the health commission said in a statement on its website. The city has also put the district where the village is located on the 2nd-lowest alert level on its 4-level system for plague response until the end of 2020.

The Baotou city health commission said the patient, who died of circulatory system failure, was confirmed to have "intestinal-type plague," referring to a category diagnosed from symptoms including diarrhea, severe abdominal pain and high fever, according to guidelines issued by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

[Plague is caused by _Yersinia pestis_.

Most cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea, causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a "bubo."

Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being bitten.

When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antimicrobial therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. At this stage, person-to-person spread can occur, causing other cases of "primary" plague pneumonia. A quarantine would be required with contact tracing, and even prophylactic antimicrobials, if the index case or cases actually had plague pneumonia.

This report refers to "intestinal" plague. While other species of yersiniosis, _pseudotuberculosis_, and _enterocolitica_ involve the gastrointestinal tract, _Y. pestis_ generally does not. - Mod.LL
