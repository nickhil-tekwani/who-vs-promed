Legionnaires' hits area nursing home
------------------------
9 elderly residents of a new nursing home in Montgomery County (Pennsylvania)
are reported to be ill, 5 of them diagnosed with Legionnaires' disease and
the other 4 being tested for it, authorities said yesterday.
"This is a potentially life-threatening situation for everyone involved," said
Susan Denman, medical director for the Madlyn and Leonard Abramson Center
for Jewish Life in Horsham.
All 9 persons had lived in their own rooms on the "D Wing" of the sprawling
that wing were moved into other rooms of the facility as a precaution
while authorities searched for a possible source of the noncontagious
bacterial illness.
The victims are all over 75 and some more than 100 years old, especially risky
for a disease that can be fatal. Denman said last night that 3 of the oldest
patients, all with confirmed Legionnaires' disease, had chosen to stay at the
nursing home. They declined to be hospitalized , where they faced (the
possibility of) being put on ventilators to survive. "They're here because
they're very, very frail," Denman said. "At this point in their lives, they
don't want that kind of treatment."
At Abington Memorial Hospital, where 5 of the Abramson residents were
hospitalized on 11 June 2002, chief of medicine John J. Kelly
stressed that there was "absolutely no risk to the community." Kelly
said 1 of the home's
male residents was in critical condition and a female resident in fair
condition. Three others with pneumonia were at Abington awaiting
Legionnaires' test results, and a fourth resident, a female, was
hospitalized and awaiting tests at Central Montgomery Hospital in
Hatfield Township. "Just because of their age alone, the illness is
likely to be more serious," Kelly said.
Worried relatives of the home's approximately 250 residents began calling
Abramson yesterday afternoon as word of the illness was reported. By last
night, however, no family members had asked that a relative be
removed from the facility. "I think most of the family members are
reassured by the measures
we are taking and that we are taking this very seriously," she said.
Relatives were being notified in a detailed mailing that was sent out.
The 324-bed facility has "stopped any new admissions and will be moving
any patients in the affected wing to other parts of the facility," Denman
said.
The crisis at the facility, formerly known as the Philadelphia Geriatric
Center, when it was located in the Logan section of Philadelphia, began
last week when a resident who had been sent to Abington Memorial Hospital with
what was believed to be pneumonia did not respond to treatment, Denman said.
The Montgomery County Health Department has conducted "environmental"
tests in an effort to identify the source of the disease. Those test
results were not
expected for 2 days, department spokeswoman Harriet Morton said.
Legionnaires' disease is an airborne respiratory infection whose bacteria breed
in air-conditioning cooling towers, hot-water tanks, whirlpool spas,
humidifiers, faucets, shower heads and moist soil. For that reason, the county
health department yesterday recommended "a thorough cleaning, disinfecting and
heat-and-flush of the facility's HVAC [heating, ventilation and air-
conditioning system] and potable water (e.g. showers, etc.) system. If there
are therapeutic hot tubs of swimming pools, those should be included." John
Hartman, the facility's director of plant operations, said he didn't know where
the bacteria came from.
The elderly and those with weakened immune systems have the greatest
risk of contracting the disease, Pennsylvania Health Department
spokesman Richard McGarvey said yesterday. Montgomery County
typically has about three a year and all of Pennsylvania about 150,
McGarvey said. Many cases are never reported or identified, he added.

[Legionella continues to be a problem in many environmental situations. Health
care facilities, both in acute and chronic settings, remain environments of
major importance for this infection. In this case, the occurrence of
legionellosis isolated to one wing of the nursing facility implies
environmental contamination of a localized source, rather than a
source common to the entire structure. Since pneumonia overall
represents a much more significant cause of morbidity and mortality
in the elderly, those with underlying structural lung disease and
patients with cellular immunosuppression, the environmental spread of
legionellosis in a hospital or nursing home can be, and often is, a
major event. -Mod.LL]
