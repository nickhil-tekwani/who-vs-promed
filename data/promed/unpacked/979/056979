As of 22 Aug 2005, 88 cases of malaria have been recorded in the city of
Bishkek and the Chuysk region. 63 of these cases have been registered among
inhabitants of the city of Nishkek, with 25 among inhabitants of the Chuysk
region (Alamudun area 17, Moscow area 3, Sokuluk area 3, Issik-Atinsk 1,
and Keminsk area 1).
According to state officials, all cases of malaria have been confirmed with
laboratory tests, and the diagnosis is 3-day malaria. In present time, 45
people are getting specific treatment in the Republic Infectious Diseases
Hospital.
Measures have been taken to prevent [the development of an] epidemic.
Epidemiologists and entomologists hope that due to the cooling of the
weather, propagation of mosquitoes will slow down and the outbreak will
stop by itself.

[ProMED reported 18 cases of malaria from Bishkek on 23 Jul 2005; cases
have increased considerably. We still do not have a species identification,
although a review of the literature available on the internet (see Lysenko
AY, Semashko IN., Medical Geography, Geography of Malaria, , Chapters 1-6,
<http://rbm.who.int/docs/lysenko/lysenko_chapters1-6.pdf>) revealed that
the term "three day malaria" has been used in Russia and former Russian
States to refer to plasmodium vivax. Readers are referred to the comment
from the 23 Jul 2005 posting concerning previous statistics for malaria in
Kyrgyzstan. - Mods.EP/MPP]
[Bishkek is the capital of Kyrgyzstan and its population is 768 000. The
Chuysk region borders Bishkek and has 765 700 people. - Mod.NR]
