Bluetongue in Europe - Apr-Jun 2012 [Defra's International disease monitoring, April to June 2012]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There have been no new disease outbreaks associated with serotype 8 of the bluetongue virus (BTV) in northern
Europe. Most recently, Spain has lifted the BTV-8 restriction zone across most of the mainland, with just a small zone in the
south remaining in place. Germany has lifted the BTV-8 zone, following extensive surveillance. Outbreaks of other serotypes
are sporadically occurring in other countries in the southern European Union and neighbouring countries and therefore the
threat of a new BTV incursion cannot be ignored.

In Italy, an outbreak of BTV-9 was reported in a sentinel cow in Catania in June 2012. Movement controls and tracings are
ongoing.

In Greece, 2 outbreaks of BTV-4 were reported in sentinel cattle in Rhodes. Vaccination is prohibited. In one of the outbreaks,
BTV-16 was also detected.

[According to the above information, during the 2nd semester of 2012 3 BTV serotypes (BTV-4, BTV-9 and BTV-16) have been found to be circulating in Europe, all in its southern part (Greece and Italy), which - until the appearance of BTV-8 in Aug 2006 in the Dutch-German-Belgian border triade -- was regarded as the main area at risk. This heralds 2012's vector season in animal and man, traditionally expected to peak during the 3rd semester of the year.

The spectrum of the culicoides-borne diseases that may appear in Europe during these months has been increasing during the last decade. On top of orbiviruses, including several BTV serotypes (particularly BTV-8) in ruminants, EHD in cattle (Turkey, Israel the Maghreb) and Equine encephalosis (equines, Israel), monitoring should include other emerging vector-borne diseases. They include the teratogenic Schmallenberg virus in ruminants, Ephemeral bovine disease (three-day-sickness) in cattle, West-Nile virus in humans and equines, and the Usutu virus (already recorded in Austria, Germany, Switzerland Italy) in humans and blackbirds. Another potential arthropod-borne disease, recently reported from the Eastern Mediterranean, is Lumpy skin disease in cattle (Egypt, north-Israel).- Mod.AS.
