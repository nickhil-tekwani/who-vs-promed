9 new cases of monkeypox suspected in Midwest
--------------------------
9 new cases of suspected monkeypox were reported in the Midwest by state
and federal health authorities yesterday [Mon 9 Jun 2003], bringing the
number of suspected victims to at least 37.
4 of the cases have been confirmed as monkeypox by genetic [PCR?] tests,
but the disease is so distinct that most of the suspected victims probably
have the virus, said Dr. Stephen M. Ostroff of the federal Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. State and federal officials are trying to
track down other people who might have purchased diseased pet prairie dogs,
which are believed to be the source of the outbreak.
None of the victims has died, but authorities are taking aggressive action
to contain the epidemic for fear that the virus will obtain a permanent
foothold in the United States, much as West Nile virus did after a case was
identified in New York City in 1999. West Nile virus spread from coast to
coast, infecting nearly 4200 people last year and killing 284. Although
monkeypox virus does not seem to be [highly contagious] and probably is not
as lethal, authorities would like to stop it in its tracks. Monkeypox
[virus] is closely related to smallpox [virus] but is not as infectious nor
as deadly. It is usually found only in the rain forest countries of western
and central Africa.
Wisconsin officials were startled last month [May 2003] when a 3-year-old
child was hospitalized with a high fever, swollen glands and red pustules on
her body, typically signs of smallpox. Both of her parents developed a milder
form of the disease. Scientists at the Marshfield Clinic quickly identified a
virus that looked like a poxvirus [by electron microscopy]. The CDC heard
about the finding late Wednesday and immediately dispatched a research team,
which returned to Atlanta with samples on Friday night. By Saturday
afternoon, CDC researchers had confirmed that the virus was monkeypox virus
and made the information public, looking for other cases. As of yesterday
afternoon, 22 suspected cases had been reported in Wisconsin, 10 in Indiana
and 5 in Illinois. Ostroff said it is likely that most of the suspected cases
will be confirmed.
The cases were quickly linked to contact with prairie dogs and, in one case,
a rabbit. The animals were traced back to a suburban Chicago business, Phil's
Pocket Pets, which specializes in small, friendly rodents. Researchers think
the prairie dogs came into contact with a Gambian giant rat, also imported as
a pet, which apparently carried the virus. State and federal health
authorities are trying to track down 115 customers, individuals and pet
stores, that have purchased the prairie dogs from the store since 15 Apr 2003.
Officials have seen no evidence of human-to-human transmission of the virus,
Ostroff said. Everyone who has caught it has been in close contact with the
animals. That included 6 veterinarians, their assistants and "3 or 4" in pet
shops, he said. The rest of the victims were in families that purchased the
animals. One caught it from a rabbit that had been in contact with a sick
prairie dog. Officials have warned anyone in the region with a prairie dog
that appears to be ill to contact public health authorities or a
veterinarian. Under no circumstances should a sick animal be released into
the wild, where it could infect other animals, they said.
Monkeypox virus is a member of the [_Orthopoxvirus_ genus of the family
_Poxviridae_], which includes smallpox virus. Symptoms, which usually begin
about 12 days after exposure, include fever, headache, body aches, chills,
drenching sweat and sometimes a cough. One to 10 days later, these symptoms
are followed by a rash with pustules that eventually crust over. Contact
with the pustules is the primary source of transmission, but it can be
spread by coughing.
There is no treatment for the disease, although the CDC is testing
cidofovir, an antiviral drug. Studies in Africa suggest that 1 percent to 10
percent of victims have died, but researchers note that the higher mortality
rates occurred in people who were chronically malnourished, making it
difficult for them to fight off the infection. Studies in Africa have also
shown that even though the virus can be passed from person to person, it
loses much of its virulence and infectiousness after several generations of
infection, breaking the transmission chain. Vaccinations against smallpox
apparently provide some protection against monkeypox infections.

[The identity of the infectious agent appears to be have been confirmed
unequivocally as Monkeypox virus. Monkeypox virus, like smallpox virus, is a
member of the genus _Orthopoxvirus_ of the family _Poxviridae_, but the two
viruses are not the most closely related members of the genus. The name of
the virus is misleading as monkeys -- and probably humans -- become infected
by exposure to the rodent or squirrel natural reservoir host. Person-to-person
transmission is rare and does not appear to have occurred in this outbreak
in the Midwest (the first outside West/Central Africa). The outbreak is
unlikely to spread beyond those in contact with the infected rodents. The
principal concern is the possibility that the virus might spread to wild
rodent populations by accidental release, or escape of infected pet animals. -
