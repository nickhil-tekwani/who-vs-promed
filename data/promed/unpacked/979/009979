One more victim has died of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in
southern Kazakhstan, the press service of the Kazakh Emergencies
Ministry told the Itar-Tass News Agency. 20 people who were in
contact with the deceased are under the care of physicians.
Anti-epidemic measures are taken in the area.
The Aral region is a natural centre of the disease. It is the 5th
fatal case in Kazakhstan since the beginning of this year [2007]. The
disease was the result of an infected tick's bite. Virus-carrying
ticks live on cattle and other livestock and [may be present in]
premises where cattle are housed [and have not been disinfected]. A
tick's bite is often not noticed, and 1st symptoms of the dangerous
disease are similar to an ordinary cold.
