Taiwan: preventative measures stepped up
----------------------------------------
Taiwan authorities have stepped up precautions against an outbreak of
dengue fever, as nearly 4000 cases have been diagnosed, according to the
latest official data.
Kaohsiung, the epicenter, had reported 2025 cases by yesterday, [according
to a Xinhua Agency report]. Local health officials are concerned that the
epidemic may well persist into next year and preventive efforts have been
stepped up to reduce the spread of the disease.

Indonesia: dengue fever outbreak affects West Kalimantan; seath toll now 18
--------------------------------
While the nation is waging a war against terrorism, people in the West
Kalimantan capital of Pontianak are fighting a dengue fever outbreak that
so far has claimed 18 lives. Medical officials expect a prolonged battle
against the disease now that the rainy season is approaching. A total of
1140 dengue fever cases has been discovered in the area over the past 10
months, with a sharp increase in the first week of November with 82 cases.
"To anticipate the worst, we are continuing to carry out a fogging program
[ultra low volume particle spraying with insecticide (used indoors and
outside). - Mod.SH] to eliminate mosquitoes," a Pontianak health official,
Kodasi, said. He called on people in the city to keep their environment
clean to prevent the _Aedes_ mosquitoes, which carry dengue fever, from
multiplying. The city's health office has said that a lack of funds has
left it unprepared to cope with a dengue fever outbreak of this scale, due
in part to an absence of financial assistance from the provincial
administration.
The head of Communicable Diseases and Environmental Health at the West
Kalimantan Provincial Health Office, Budianto, said the provincial
administration had not yet disbursed Rp 200 million (US$22 200) to help
Pontianak fight the outbreak. He did not give a reason for the delay. "The
Pontianak administration must temporarily rely on their own funds and
facilities," he said. But, Budianto said, the provincial health office
would continue its fogging program across the province. "Currently we are
fogging Kota Baru in West Pontianak," he said.
Meanwhile, in Singkawang, Bengkayang regency, West Kalimantan, 69 dengue
fever sufferers are being treated at the Abdul Aziz Hospital. The hospital
has provided extra beds to anticipate an increase in the number of
patients. A hospital official, Titien, said the number of dengue fever
cases in the area had risen sharply recently. "An average of 5 patients are
sent to this hospital every day with dengue fever," she said. Budianto
played down the dengue fever outbreak in Singkawang, saying the local
government was able to deal with the matter on its own. But he added that
he had yet to receive a complete report on the spread of dengue fever in
Singkawang.
In Samarinda, East Kalimantan, the health office suggested people in the
province remain vigilant for dengue fever during the transition period from
the dry to the rainy season. "Dengue fever can occur in many places in the
province, particularly Balikpapan, Kutai, and Samarinda. But the number of
cases will increase during the transition period between the seasons," the
deputy head of the health office, Sugianto, said. He called on regency and
mayoralty administrations across the province to take all necessary steps
to eliminate the mosquitoes. "The best method is to use mosquito powder on
water storage tanks, cover up the tanks and clean them twice a week, and
bury unnecessary cans and such that can hold water," he said. According to
him, fogging is not the best method for eliminating mosquitoes as it only
kills mature mosquitoes, not the larvae.
Last year at least 30 people in the province died of dengue fever, and the
total number of cases rose sharply to over 1200 from 700 in 2000.
