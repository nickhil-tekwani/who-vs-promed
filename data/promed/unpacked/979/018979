The tiger mosquito, or [_Aedes_] _albopictus_, is the insect vector of
dengue and chikungunya [viruses], diseases prevalent in warmer
countries. One recalls the chikungunya epidemic that struck La Reunion
[island] during 2005, with over 5000 reported cases.

This disease is characterized especially by high fever and arthralgia
[joint pain].

If this species is established permanently in the South of France, no
[chikungunya or dengue] illnesses have [yet] been reported in France.
This does not prevent the DGS (Directorate of Health) from monitoring
the progression of this insect wherever it advances along its road
routes.

"We discovered the 1st specimens in late July [2009] during one of the
identifications that we made from our routine oviposition traps," says
Delphine Rey, a biologist at the Interdepartmental Alliance for
Mosquito Control. Based in Chindrieux (Savoy), it aims to fight
against the proliferation of mosquitoes. This unit is responsible for
identifying [mosquito] breeding sites and then put in place methods to
control the species. The team has installed hundreds of traps in the 5
departments where it occurs (Ain, Savoie, Haute-Savoie, Isere, and
Rhone).

[Breeding sites] are those containing stagnant water where mosquitoes
lay their eggs. Until now, only traps in Aiton, Savoy, and Manissieux
in eastern Lyon, the Lyon-Chambery motorway, have revealed the
presence of the famous "tiger" [mosquito].

The traps are installed along the roads by which the insect spreads.
"It comes mainly from Italy, where it has been rapidly expanding in
recent years. The larvae [and eggs] are most often carried by water in
truck and car tires. They can then hatch during warm weather. Hence
the surveillance by specialists, who conduct regular inspections and
treatments to prevent spread.

Delphine Rey gives this advice for prevention: "Do not leave any
standing water near homes. The containers such as flower pots [and
vases] attract many mosquitoes.

[This report indicates that _Aedes albopictus_ is spreading northward
into Europe, with attendant risk of transmission of dengue and
chikungunya, and possibly other viruses, as occurred with chikungunya
virus in central Italy in 2007 (see ProMED archive). This virus was
introduced into France earlier in 2009 by a traveler from Singapore,
but without ongoing transmission (see ProMED-mail archive no.
20090423.1524).

Professor EA Gould provided an interesting commentary emphasizing the
importance of adaptation of chikungunya virus to _Aedes albopictus_,
with the risk of wide geographic spread to areas where this mosquito
has become established (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20080910.2829). In
that comment, Professor Gould points out the importance of _Ae.
albopictus_ as a vector of other important viruses such as dengue.
France has been classified as having a relatively high risk of _Ae.
albopictus_ establishment (see reference below).
