The health authorities are strongly suspicious that the death of a
9-year-old child was due to rabies virus [infection], which is a disease
that attacks primarily the brain tissue in humans. The boy died on 29 Sep
[?2001], after suffering a progressive paralysis and respiratory distress.
The child lived in a marginal neighborhood [presumably a peri-urban lower
socioeconomic area -- Mod. MPP], of Ciudad Neily, in the southern zone. He
was cared for at a local hospital on 22 Sept, but due to the severity of
his illness, he was referred to the Children's Hospital [in San Jose] the
following day.
When he was admitted to this hospital [Children's], he was already one week
into the illness with symptoms that progressed rapidly and lead to his
death, the Director of the Children's Hospital, Rodolfo Hernandez informed
a press conference yesterday.
It is unknown if the young child was bitten by any animal, although old
scratches were found on his body. That which is known is that the child was
at a cattle ranch one month ago, in a zone where there are abundant bats,
raccoons and foxes, animals which are known to be transmitters of the
rabies virus.
According to the director of epidemiologic surveillance of the Ministry of
Health, Gloria Terwes Posada, tissue specimens were sent to an Argentinian
laboratory to either discard or confirm the presence of the [rabies] virus.
The [results] will be ready in one month.
According to the differential diagnosis which the doctors are obliged to
have, there are also other hypotheses [of the cause of the fatal illness of
this child] which includes the possibilities of infectious mononucleosis,
cytomegalovirus [infection], _Campylobacter_ or poliomyelitis (for which
there has not been any cases reported [in Costa Rica] since 1974],
diseases which have as a common element a flaccid paralysis. As preventive
measures, Terwes said that in the zone where the child lived they are
increasing surveillance activities.
The WHO [World Health Organizastion] declared the country free of rabies in
1980. As a result of these measures, up through yesterday they have not
detected any persons or animals they suspect to be carriers of the [rabies]
virus, the Ministry official said.
On alert Terwes explained that in the country there have not been any cases
of canine rabies since 1987. The largest outbreak of human rabies was said
to have occurred in 1968 when 11 persons died. On the continent, Costa
Rica, Puerto
Rico and Uruguay are the only countries that, in the last decade, have not
reported a single case of rabies.
To prevent the circulation of the virus, they have begun preventive
vaccination [post exposure prophylaxis with rabies vaccine] in persons who
had contact with the child and who are at risk by cause of their activities
(for example: ranchers, veterinarians ).
For now, there are advisories to maintain an alert for sudden changes in
the behavior of animals, and report them to the MAG or Ministry of Health.

[On the list of possible other etiologies for the flaccid paralysis
syndrome, they have left out the diagnosis of Guillain-Barre Syndrome,
which in the post-polio elimination era in the Americas is the most common
cause of flaccid paralysis in children less than 15 years old.
According to GIDEON (Global Infectious Disease Epidemiology Network
<http://www.gideononline.com/>, recent activity has been observed in bats
and cattle. 3 rabid animals were reported in 1980; 2 in 1981; 0 in 1982; 0
in 1983; 0 in 1984; 15 in 1985; 6 in 1986; 3 in 1987; 0 in 1988; 3 in 1989;
1 in 1990; 3 in 1991; 1 in 1992; 2 in 1993; 8 (all ruminants) in 1994; 4
(all ruminants) in 1995; 0 in 1996; 3 in 1997; 5 in 1998 (all ruminants); 2
in 1999 (ruminants). 2 rabid dogs were reported in 1980; 0 during 1981 to
1986; 2 in 1987; 0 during 1988 to 1999. More information on this case and
the official investigation would be very much appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
