The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is warning consumers not to
drink certain brands of mineral water imported from Armenia due to
the risk of exposure to arsenic, a toxic substance and known cause of
cancer in humans. Symptoms of acute arsenic exposure usually occur
within several hours of consumption, [and most likely include]
include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and stomach pain. Over the period
of a few days to weeks, the kidneys, liver, skin, and cardiovascular
and nervous systems could be affected. Extended exposure could lead
to cancer and death.
The following products were distributed nationwide and are being recalled:
* Zetlian Bakery, Inc., Pico Rivera, CA is recalling the product with
labels that read: "Jermuk Original Sparkling Natural Mineral Water
Fortified With Natural Gas From The Spring", "2006 Jermuk Mayr
Gortsaran CJSC", and "Imported by: Zetlian Bakery Inc."
* Importers Direct Wholesale Company, Los Angeles, CA is recalling
the product with labels that read: "Jermuk Sodium Calcium Bicarbonate
and Sulphate Mineral Water", "Bottled by ARPI Plant, Republic of
Armenia", and "Exclusive US importer and distributor: Importers
Direct Wholesale Co., Los Angeles, CA".
* Kradjian Importing Company, Glendale, CA is recalling the product
with labels that read: "Jermuk, Natural Mineral Water Sparkling",
"Bottled by Jermuk Group CJSC", and "Sale Agent Kradjian Importing
Co. Inc. Glendale, CA".
FDA sampled 500 milliliter (mL) green glass bottles and detected the
problem. FDA is investigating whether other sizes or packaging are involved.
FDA testing of this water revealed 500-600 micrograms of arsenic per
liter. FDA's standard of quality-bottled water allows no more than 10
micrograms per liter.
There have been no illnesses reported at this time. Consumers who
drank this water and have concerns are encouraged to contact their
health care provider.
FDA will continue working to remove all such bottled water products
from the marketplace. FDA may provide additional updates as more
information becomes available.

[Certainly, this is a high level of arsenic. It will cause gastric
upset with a fairly short time of consumption.
This release indicates organ involvement of liver, skin, kidneys, as
well as the cardiovascular and neurological systems within a few
days. The time frame will vary by individual and how much tainted
water has been consumed. Ultimately, with a high enough dose, cancer
or death may be the outcome.
For a more complete description of the effects of arsenic on the body
as well as tests and treatment, please see ProMED-mail post Arsenic
poisoning, well water - Burkina Faso 20061230.3651. - Mod.TG]
[It should be reminded that this is an imported product and the
chance exists that this product may have been imported into other
countries around the world. Hence the possibility of a multicountry
recall exists. - Mod.MPP]
