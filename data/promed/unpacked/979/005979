Three deaths in California during the past 14 months have been linked to an
arenavirus, a rare virus never before acquired by humans in North America,
State Health Director Diana M. Bontá, R.N., Dr.P.H., announced today.
The discovery followed an extensive investigation by the California
Department of Health Services (DHS) and the University of Texas Medical
Branch (UTMB) into the unexplained deaths of a 52-year-old female who died
in June 1999 in Riverside County, a 14-year-old female who died in April
2000 in Alameda County and a 30-year-old [female who died June 2000 in
Orange County. UTMB has one of the few laboratories in the country equipped
to test for arenaviruses.
In the 14-year-old patient, [an arenavirus has been confirmed and in the
two others, the virus is highly suspected based on initial laboratory
tests. Further testing is under way. The three individuals were each
hospitalized with fever and respiratory distress. Two of them also had
severe liver disease and bleeding consistent with viral hemorrhagic fever.
Like hantavirus[es, which cause a rare, but often fatal respiratory
disease, arenaviruses are believed to be transmitted to humans through
inhalation of dust contaminated with the urine, feces or saliva of infected
rodents. Human infection with arenavirus[es is also likely to be very
uncommon. Arenavirus infection has been documented in rodents in Southern
California in recent years.
"Viral hemorrhagic fever associated with arenaviruses has never been
documented in the United States except among overseas travelers and
laboratory personnel exposed accidentally while doing research," Bontá
explained.
DHS was prompted to send specimens to UTMB because of clinical and autopsy
findings suggestive of viral hemorrhagic fever and a history of rodent
contact in the Riverside County patient. The virus was detected in all
three patients through testing for virus genes. In addition, virus
isolation was used to confirm infection in the 14-year-old. There is no
evidence that these cases are related.
In parts of Africa and South America, several arenaviruses are known which
cause mild to severe infection characterized by fever, headache and
occasionally severe bleeding or nervous system problems. Lassa fever and
[Argentine hemorrhagic fever, Bolivian hemorrhagic fever, Venezuelan
hemorrhagic fever, Sabia hemorrhagic fever are examples of human illnesses
caused by such arenaviruses.
The antiviral drug ribavirin has been successfully used in the treatment of
other arenavirus infections. Studies are under way to learn more about this
virus and [drugs that may be effective.
Individuals can protect themselves from diseases carried by rodents by
taking some relatively simple precautions both in the home and while
outdoors: Do not touch or feed wild rodents or any other wild animals.
Properly dispose of trash and clutter; move woodpiles away from residences.
Prevent rodents from entering residences by blocking holes; control rodents
with spring-loaded (snap) traps. Store food and garbage in rodent-proof
containers; pet food should not be left outside. Avoid creating dust when
cleaning buildings with signs of rodent infestation. Wet the area
thoroughly with a disinfectant like bleach and use gloves to clean up.
Contact local public health officials for recommendations about safely
cleaning rodent-infested areas. Cabins and buildings that haven't been
occupied for some time should be aired out. If possible, buildings should
not be used if there are signs of rodent infestation, until properly
cleaned. When sleeping outdoors, avoid campsites near rodent droppings,
burrows or nests.

["Rumor", huh? ProMED-mail posted three messages early last month, the
first requesting information from knowledgeable sources. Those
knowledgeable sources did not respond and some even denied knowing
anything, when in fact it is clear now that they did. These are public
health officials? The second message we posted was in response to comments
from Orange County, denying knowledge of this and castigating us for
posting a rumor. The third message was just a lot of words saying not much
at all. Meanwhile, these officials either knew what was going on (first
case June 1999) or are out of the loop. Not surprising that UTMB
investigators would not speak on the record, given the apparent sensitivity
of this issue in California. There will not be an epidemic of this
arenavirus (I am guessing it is Whitewater Arroyo virus), so I ask again,
"What's the big deal about these cases, other than that they are a 'first'
for the U.S., and why have California State Health Department officials
withheld this information from the public and from their constituents, the
very people they work for?"
The bottom line here is that, no matter what country we live in, we must
stay aware that governments have a tendency to withhold information for
"the good of the public". Withholding information anywhere, be it
California, Malaya, or Cuba, is arrogant, unacceptable and, in the long
run, counterproductive. - Temp. Mod. CHC
