BSE, IFST POSITION STATEMENT - UK

The new updated IFST Position Statement on BSE has now been put on the IFST
Web site and can be accessed/downloaded from
<http://www.easynet.co.uk/ifst/hottop5.htm>
Because of the major developments since the previous (9 September 1997)
version, this one contains a great deal of additional material and is, of
necessity, considerably longer.

[This is a very long document. The summary follows. MHJ]
The Institute of Food Science & Technology, through its Public Affairs and
Technical & Legislative Committees, has authorised the following Position
Statement, dated 2 April 1998, replacing the Statement of 9 September 1997
and any previous version. This updated Position Statement takes account of
available data and published research up to 14 March 1998.
Summary
BSE incidence: The continued dramatic year-on-year fall in the number of new
UK cases of BSE (from the peak of 37,487 in 1992, to 13,825 in 1995, to
7,406 in 1996, to 3,980 in 1997) is as forecast and on track to bring the
epidemic to an end.
BSE/nvCJD: From research published from October 1996 onwards, scientific
evidence has been accumulating that BSE infectivity and new variant CJD
(nvCJD) infectivity carry the same "fingerprint". Although the scientific
evidence does not prove a causal connection, the evidence is consistent with
the transmissibility of BSE infectivity to at least some humans; and taken
in conjunction with related circumstances it increases the likelihood of a
causal connection. It is theoretically possible that both BSE and CJD may
have been triggered by some third presently unsuspected cause, but it is
difficult to conceive what that might be.
nvCJD incidence: The 3 March 1998 report from the UK Department of Health
shows definite plus probable cases of nvCJD at 23, unchanged for four months
and an increase of only two cases over the previous seven months. On 9 March
1998, SEAC was informed of a 24th case since the last monthly report.
Assuming the likelihood that nvCJD is the result of having consumed BSE
infective materials, mainly prior to 1989, however, it is too soon to draw
from the figures to date any conclusions, whether optimistic or pessimistic,
as to likely future incidence.
Infectivity of bovine materials: In its report dated 9 December 1997 the EU
Scientific Steering Committee has set out the most up-to-date information
and assessment of the infectivity risks to humans of various bovine materials.
Beef, milk and bones: Mouse assay tests have not detected BSE infectivity in
muscle meat (beef) or milk from confirmed BSE cows. Experiments so far using
the more sensitive calf assay are encouraging as regards beef and milk, but
have some years still to go. Although, therefore, it is not yet known if
beef or milk from BSE-infected cows contain amounts of BSE infectivity too
small to be detected by mouse assay, current risk from beef or milk is
considered to be extremely small. The same calf experiments have detected
infectivity in the dorsal root ganglia, the trigeminal ganglia and the bone
marrow. Risk assessment has indicated that the risk involved to people
eating beef is extremely low, about one new case of variant CJD in a billion
years per person. However the risk estimate has a wide range of uncertainty.
The UK Government has responded by banning the sale of bone-in beef.
Gelatin and tallow: In its report of 19-20 February 1998, the EU Scientific
Steering Committee carried out risk assessments of various raw materials and
production processes for gelatin and tallow, and issued "Scientific
Opinions" thereon.
Blood: Recent research reports, including the finding of infectivity in the
tonsils of nvCJD victims, and research on mice showing that the lymph system
is involved in passage of infectivity from gut to brain, implicate the
lymphoreticular system, and suggest the possibility that circulating
lymphocytes in the blood may carry infectivity. This has led SEAC to suggest
the leucodepletion of blood supplies as a precautionary measure.
Official Inquiry into BSE and CJD: IFST welcomed the announcement of the
official independent enquiry into BSE, its terms of reference and the open
way in which it is being conducted, as outlined by Lord Justice Phillips.
IFST has made a written submission to the Inquiry.
