Public Health Dispatch: Outbreak of _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 and
_Campylobacter_
Among Attendees of the Washington County Fair -- New York, 1999 On
September 3, 1999, the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH)
received reports of at least 10 children hospitalized with bloody diarrhea
or _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 infection in counties near Albany, New York.
All of the children had attended the Washington County Fair, which was held
August 23-29, 1999; approximately 108 000 persons attended the fair during
that week. Subsequently, fair attendees infected with _Campylobacter
jejuni_ also were identified. An ongoing investigation includes heightened
case-finding efforts, epidemiologic and laboratory studies, and an
environmental investigation of the Washington County fairgrounds. This
report presents the preliminary findings implicating contaminated well
water.
To identify additional fair attendees with diarrhea, the NYSDOH issued
press releases, conducted daily press briefings, and contacted emergency
departments, laboratories, and infection-control practitioners by fax and
telephone. Laboratories were asked to culture all diarrheal stool specimens
for _E. coli_ O157:H7 and subsequently for _Campylobacter_ spp.
As of September 15, 921 persons reported diarrhea after attending the
Washington County Fair. Stool cultures yielded _E. coli_ O157:H7 from 116
persons; 13 of these persons were co-infected with _C. jejuni_. Stool
cultures from 32 additional persons yielded only _Campylobacter_.
Sixty-five persons have been hospitalized; 11 children have developed
hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS); and two persons died: a 3-year-old girl
from HUS and a 79-year-old man from HUS/thrombotic thrombocytopenic
purpura. Cases of diarrheal illness among fair attendees have been reported
from 14 New York counties and four states.
An environmental investigation of the fairgrounds on September 3 determined
that much of the fair was supplied with chlorinated water. However, in at
least one area of the fair, a shallow well supplied unchlorinated water to
several food vendors who used the water to make beverages and ice. Initial
cultures of water from this well yielded high levels of coliforms and _E.
coli_.
A case-control study was conducted to determine risk factors for infection.
Case-patients were residents of Washington County who developed diarrhea
after attending the fair and in whom stool cultures yielded _E. coli_
O157:H7 or _Campylobacter_. Controls were residents of Washington County
randomly selected from the telephone directory who had attended the fair
and were frequency-matched by age group. Thirty-two case-patients and 84
controls were enrolled. Analysis was limited to those attending the fair at
least once during the final 4 days of the fair because all ill persons,
including those attending only once, attended during that period. Drinking
water or beverages made with water from the suspect well was associated
with illness. Twenty-six (81%) of 32 case-patients and nine (16%) of 57
controls had consumed water from this well during the final 4 days of the
fair (matched odds ratio=23.3; 95% confidence interval=6.3-86.9). When
controlled for water consumption, other exposures, such as eating food at
the fair and contact with manure, were not significantly associated with
illness.
On September 9, the New York State Public Health Laboratory, the Wadsworth
Center, used five different polymerase chain reaction assays to demonstrate
the presence of _E. coli_ O157:H7 DNA in water from the implicated well and
subsequently isolated the organism from water samples from the well and the
water distribution system. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis testing by the
Wadsworth Center showed that the DNA "fingerprints" of _E. coli_ O157:H7
isolates from the well, the water distribution system, and most patients
were similar. Water sampling for _Campylobacter_ spp. is ongoing.
To prevent secondary transmission of enteric infection, letters were sent
to schools and day care centers emphasizing the need to exclude symptomatic
children and practice careful handwashing. Letters also were sent to
nursing homes and hospitals with recommendations regarding employees and
residents with diarrhea. Information to the public about the outbreak also
focused on how to prevent secondary infections. On September 13, the state
health commissioner issued an order requiring county fairgrounds to use
disinfected water when hosting public events; the commissioner also is
reviewing laws and regulations applicable to fairs.
