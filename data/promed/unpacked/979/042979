The Pennsylvania Game Commission today [1 Mar 2013] confirmed 3 hunter-killed deer taken in the 2012 general firearms deer season have tested positive for chronic wasting disease (CWD). 2 were from Blair County; the other was from Bedford County.

"These are the 1st positive cases of CWD in free-ranging deer in Pennsylvania," confirmed Pennsylvania Game Commission Executive Director Carl G Roe. "The disease was first documented in early October 2012 [see ProMED-mail archive no. 20121014.1341794], by the state Department of Agriculture in a captive deer on an Adams County deer farm."

The 3 hunter-killed deer tissue samples were collected by Game Commission personnel during annual deer aging field checks during the general firearms season for deer. The samples were tested and identified as suspect positive by the Department of Agriculture as part of an ongoing annual statewide CWD surveillance program. The tissue samples were confirmed to be positive for CWD by the National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa, as part of an established verification process.

"The 3 CWD-positives were part of 2945 deer sampled for the disease statewide," explained Roe. "To date, we have received test results from 1500 samples, including these 3 positive samples. Results from the remaining samples should be available in the next few weeks."

An additional 2089 deer were sampled and tested from within the designated Disease Management Area in Adams and York counties; CWD was not detected in any of those deer samples. Since 1998, the Game Commission has gathered and submitted more than 43 000 samples from wild deer and elk for CWD testing. The 3 CWD-positives announced today [1 Mar 2013] are the first to be confirmed in 15 years of testing.

"Pennsylvania has an active Interagency CWD Task Force and a dynamic CWD surveillance program," Roe noted, "and we will continue to be vigilant and initiate steps included in the Commonwealth's CWD Response Plan. We will continue to work diligently with the Department of Agriculture and other members of the task force to better manage the threat of this disease to the state's captive and wild deer populations."

The Game Commission is working to identify and engage the hunters who harvested these CWD-positive deer to confirm where the whitetails were killed. A meeting of the Interagency CWD Task Force is being convened this afternoon [1 Mar 2013] to discuss the new CWD-positive deer and possible additional actions to determine the prevalence and distribution of the disease within Pennsylvania, as well as to contain its spread.

The latest information and updates to existing CWD information can be accessed on the Game Commission's website (http://www.pgc.state.pa.us). Public meetings will be held in the Blair-Bedford County area in coming weeks to share what we know about these CWD-positive deer and CWD in Pennsylvania, and to answer questions the public might have about this disease. How these latest developments may influence hunting regulations and other deer policies are at this time still contingent upon the results of ongoing testing of samples from hunter-killed deer, additional surveillance and fieldwork, and Game Commission and task force deliberations.

CWD is a degenerative brain disease that affects elk, mule deer, and white-tailed deer. It is transmitted by direct animal-to-animal contact through saliva, feces, and urine. CWD is fatal in deer and elk, but there is no evidence that CWD can be transmitted to humans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and The World Health Organization.

Signs of the disease include weight loss, excessive salivation, increased drinking and urination, and abnormal behavior such as stumbling, trembling, and depression. Infected deer and elk also may allow unusually close approach by humans or natural predators. There is no known treatment or vaccine.

CWD was first discovered in Colorado captive mule deer in 1967, and has since been detected in 22 states and Canadian provinces, including Pennsylvania's neighboring states of New York, West Virginia, and Maryland.

[This disease continues to stretch to new regions. It has already been identified in New York state in counties (Oneida and Madison) that are slightly more eastern than the counties involved in Pennsylvania (Adams and York).

It should be emphasized that this disease is not known to transfer to human beings.

Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) of cervids. The TSEs are grouped together because of similarity in clinical features, pathology, and presumed etiology; the infectious agents are hypothesized to be prions (infectious proteins without associated nucleic acids). Scrapie of domestic sheep and goats, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) of cattle, and transmissible mink encephalopathy of farmed mink (_Mustela vison_) are TSEs of domestic animals. Several rare fatal diseases of humans are also TSEs; Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) occurs worldwide and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is associated with the agent of BSE where it occurs in cattle, including the United Kingdom and parts of continental Europe. Since the appearance of BSE in the mid-1980s and, especially since the 1996 announcement of an apparent relationship between BSE and variant CJD, there has been considerable media, public, and animal and human health agency interest in TSEs. Consequently, CWD is a disease of increasing concern for wildlife managers both in CWD-endemic areas and across North America. Many biological features of CWD pose significant challenges for wildlife managers attempting to control or eradicate the disease. Perhaps even greater challenges are those associated with balancing complex and often competing and conflicting interests of the general public, sportsmen, the game farming industry, traditional livestock industries, and many state and federal animal health and public health agencies. This is a short review of the biological features of CWD and strategies being used for its control and management.
