["Newcastle disease (ND) is a highly contagious and often severe disease found worldwide that affects birds including domestic poultry. It is caused by a virus in the family of paramyxoviruses.

"The disease appears in 3 forms: lentogenic or mild, mesogenic or moderate and velogenic or very virulent, also called exotic Newcastle disease. The lentogenic strains are very widespread, but cause few disease outbreaks.

"It usually presents as a respiratory disease, but depression, nervous manifestations, or diarrhoea may be the predominant clinical form.

"ND, in its highly pathogenic form, is a disease listed in the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) Terrestrial Animal Health Code and must be reported to the OIE (OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code).

"ND is transmitted most often by direct contact with diseased or carrier birds. Infected birds may shed the virus in their feces, contaminating the environment. Transmission can then occur by direct contact with feces and respiratory discharges or by contaminated food, water, equipment, and human clothing. Newcastle disease viruses can survive for several weeks in the environment, especially in cool weather.

"Due to the constant threat of introduction of the virus from wild birds, biosecurity in poultry establishments is essential.

"When the disease appears in a previously disease-free area, a stamping out policy is practiced in most countries. This includes strict isolation or quarantine of outbreaks; humane destruction of all infected and exposed birds; thorough cleaning and disinfection of premises; proper carcass disposal; pest control in flocks; depopulation followed by 21 days without poultry before restocking; avoidance of contact with birds of unknown health status; control of access to poultry farms.

"Newcastle disease is a minor zoonosis (disease of animals that can also infect humans) and can cause conjunctivitis in humans, but the condition is generally very mild and self-limiting".
