EEE Confirmed in Rapides Parish
-------------------------------
Following the 1st confirmed case of Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE)
and resulting equine death this year [2009], Agriculture and Forestry
Commissioner Mike Strain, D.V.M., is reminding horse owners to
vaccinate their horses. Strain said the Louisiana Animal Disease
Diagnostic Laboratory in Baton Rouge identified EEE as the cause of
death from blood samples drawn from the horse. The horse was stabled
in Rapides Parish.

"Since there is no cure for Eastern equine encephalitis, I urge horse
owners to vaccinate their animals," Strain said. "This is a very
preventable disease, but often horse owners wait until it's too late.
"Only rarely do horses recover from Eastern equine encephalitis,"
Strain said. "Even when an animal doesn't die, it is almost always
brain damaged and is never usable again." Strain stressed the
significance of reporting and testing suspected horses.

"This is a public health concern and we are asking all horse owners to
make sure their animals have up-to-date vaccinations and to consult a
veterinarian if their horses are displaying any symptoms. It's crucial
because that information is passed quickly on to other health
officials," he said. "With the public health concern over Eastern
equine encephalitis and other mosquito-borne illnesses, our animal
health officials are an important link to the state and nationwide
reporting systems."

State Veterinarian Henry Moreau said Eastern equine encephalitis has a
mortality rate of 90 percent. The disease causes encephalitis, or
swelling of the brain, in both horses and humans. Humans and horses
contract the disease from a mosquito that has bitten an infected bird.
Infected horses become depressed and uncoordinated, develop a sleepy
appearance, walk in circles and eventually collapse to the ground.

Horses that have not been vaccinated should have 2 doses administered
about 2 weeks apart. Once the initial vaccination has been given, an
annual booster is sufficient to maintain immunity. Owners with horses
displaying any of these signs should contact their local veterinarian.
Any suspected equine neuro-encephalitis case should be reported upon
suspicion of disease symptoms even if blood is not drawn.

The Department of Agriculture and Forestry is working with local
veterinarians, horse owner groups, health officials and local mosquito
abatement programs to monitor the spread of the disease.

[This is a deadly and devastating disease that can be prevented. The
vaccine for EEE is combined with other vaccines such as Western equine
encephalitis and West Nile virus. In many cases it is also combined
with Venezuelan equine encephalitis. So a series of injections can
protect the horse against many mosquito-borne diseases. - Mod.TG]

[Cases in horses are an alert that mosquitoes in the area are
infected. Therefore people in the area should take precautions
against mosquito bites, by wearing long-sleeved shirts, long pants,
and mosquito repellent. EEE is an endemic disease in the Eastern
seaboard states from New Hampshire to Texas, and around the Great
Lakes. Now that many horses are vaccinated, there may be no warning
from sick horses, so anti-mosquito precautions are necessary
throughout the endemic zone during the mosquito season -- see CDC map
