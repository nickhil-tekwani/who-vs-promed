Another Holstein steer has tested positive for bovine TB [tuberculosis] in Huron County -- the 2nd to be affected by the disease in less than 2 months. A large dairy lot in the eastern part of the county has been quarantined by the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDA) after slaughterhouse surveillance confirmed the steer was bovine TB-positive on 4 Apr 2014.

Bovine TB is a disease affecting the lungs and lymph nodes of cattle and other animals and is transmitted through nose-to-nose contact or by ingesting feeds contaminated with [_Mycobacterium bovis_] bacteria, according to the MDA. The bacterium does not grow in muscle tissue, meaning the food supply is not affected. [Certainly, any lesions, or spot that may look like it could be TB, causes the carcass to be culled. In other words, that carcass cannot enter the food chain. - Mod.TG]

MDA expects the steer came from a Saginaw County feedlot quarantined in March of last year [2013], making it the 2nd occurrence in Huron County since 10 Feb 2014. "We have reason to believe it will be linked to the Saginaw outbreak last year [2013], but we are waiting for full genome sequence," said Dr James Averill, state veterinarian and division director for MDA's animal industry. The MDA is not legally permitted to disclose the specific location of farms where cattle have tested positive for bovine TB or its producers, but Averill said it is classified as a large lot -- one with more than 100 cattle.

Clark Elftman, board of commissioner's chair, brought the issue up at Tuesday's [8 Apr 2014] commission meeting. Elftman said he had learned the Holstein steer that tested positive for bovine TB on 4 Apr 2014 had occurred in the Port Hope area, which came up at a 7 Apr 2014 producer meeting attended by health department officials and scheduled by the MDA in Fairhaven Township. "There are people out there with 1000 animals, or more, so this could really be a problem," he said.

Averill said if the steer did not originate from the Saginaw herd, or any other infected herd the MDA has knowledge of, it would be considered a new outbreak and could impact the TB-free status in the southern part of the state. "We hope this other Huron feedlot will tie back to Saginaw County," he said, adding that a 10-mile [16 km] surveillance testing radius would need to be established if the steer did not come from Saginaw so the MDA could understand "what's going on the landscape."

Averill said the owner has agreed to sell all animals on the infected lot. They will then be sent directly to a slaughterhouse. The majority of cattle would have been ready for slaughter in the next couple months, he said. The incident will be "fairly well mitigated" by the fact that the producer will be able to finish feeding and send the cattle to slaughter, Averill said. Still, the impact on the farm remains. "It's devastating to the farm," Averill said. "There is some downtime and a break in cash flow. They're going to lose some money, but it will almost be awash for this particular producer." Averill considered the "mental anguish and shock" that sets in when a producer realizes that the lot has tested positive to be an even larger burden.

A family-run farm in Fairhaven Township remains under quarantine after inspectors discovered a 2 year old steer tested positive for bovine TB on 10 Feb 2014. A 3-mile [4.8 km] radius has been drawn for surveillance testing, with the lot at the center, to see if the disease has affected area farms. It was the 1st incident in the county for "at least 40, if not 50 years," Averill said. "This newest feedlot is likely the 5th herd tied back to the Saginaw dairy farm," he said.

Bovine TB outbreaks have frequented an 11-county zone in northeastern Michigan since the 1990s when the disease re-emerged. They have impacted local economies in the Alpena and Rogers City areas, Elftman said on Tuesday [8 Apr 2014]. "It dramatically affected everything there -- the business, tourism, everything," he said, adding that the "state is right on top of" handling the situation.

Two incidences have now surfaced in Huron County, while Midland, Gratiot, and Arenac counties also have reported cattle testing positive for bovine TB stemming from the Saginaw lot. Averill said beef is safe to eat and animals that have lesions suggestive of bovine TB are pulled and do not enter the food supply. "There's no food safety issue her for consumers," he said.

Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious disease of both animals and humans. It is caused by 3 specific types of bacteria that are part of the _Mycobacterium_ group: _M. bovis_, _M. avium_, and _M. tuberculosis_. Bovine TB, caused by _M. bovis_, can be transmitted from livestock to humans and other animals.

TB can be passed to a herd by infected cattle, cervids, swine, and humans. It is spread through the respiration of TB bacteria aerosols, through feed or watering sites contaminated with saliva and other discharges, or by drinking raw, unpasteurized milk from infected animals. The risk of exposure is greatest in enclosed areas, such as barns with poor ventilation.

TB is difficult to diagnose with clinical signs alone. In the early stages of TB, clinical signs are not visible. In later stages, clinical signs may include: emaciation, lethargy, weakness, anorexia, low-grade fever, and pneumonia with a chronic, moist cough. Lymph enlargement may also be present.

There is also a nationwide surveillance program in slaughter plants. If lesions consistent with TB appear on a carcass, a sample is sent to APHIS [Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service] National Veterinary Services Laboratories [NVSL] for confirmation.

The state officials will likely be tracing the movements of animals into and out of this herd in an effort to find the originating herd or herds.
