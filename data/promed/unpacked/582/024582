September was the last ProMED-mail had posted anything on the determination
of the etiologic agent of hand-foot-and mouth disease (HFMD) in Pacific rim
countries. Much of this work has now been published and we can direct the
subscribers (who are interested) to the following relevant publications
(obtained from the U.S. National Library of Medicine's MEDLINE
<http://www.nlm.nih.gov/nlmhome.html>) that have appeared this year, some
of them very recently:

Apparently, the 1997 enterovirus 71 (EV71) Sarawak isolates are from what
is being called group B. In 1997, in Peninsular Malaysia, there were two
group B lineages and several group C EV71 isolates. In 1998, only the
group C lineage was seen in Malaysia. These isolates, however, were
distinct from all group C viruses found in Taiwan (three different
lineages). The general conclusion is that there is no correlation between
strain of virus and clinical outcome. Clearly, a great deal of excellent
work has come from these studies.
These data leave some questions as to the etiologic relevance of Jane
Cardosa's adenovirus from some of the Sarawak patients. Given that one
cannot fulfill Koch's postulates with human infections, what scientific
evidence is needed to determine the etiology of an emerging disease? We
have gone through this problem at least twice this year: Nipah virus in
Malaysia and West Nile virus in New York City. Perhaps the EV71 vs.
adenovirus conundrum could be used as a model for determining etiology in
emerging infectious diseases. For example, is all that is needed is
excellent epidemiologic studies or will genomic sequencing suffice? I'm
betting on good old, competent epidemiologists to provide the answers, with
molecular data in a supportive role of course, but who will do the
competent epidemiology when so much emphasis and funding is put on viral
chemistry and so little on gumshoe epidemiology? If our subscribers have
any ideas, please send them to me and I will collate them and post the
collection.
In any event, this ends the EV71/HFMD string.
