CDC is collaborating with public health and agriculture officials in
many states and the Department of Agriculture's (USDA) National
Poultry Improvement Plan (NPIP) to investigate a multistate outbreak
of human _Salmonella [enterica_] serotype Altona infections. As of 8
Jun 2011, a total of 39 individuals infected with the outbreak strain
of _S._ Altona have been reported from 15 states. The number of ill
persons identified in each state is as follows: Georgia (1), Indiana
(1), Kentucky (4), Michigan (1), Maryland (3), Minnesota (1), North
Carolina (6), New York (2), Ohio (8), Pennsylvania (4), Tennessee (2),
Virginia (3), Vermont (1), Wisconsin (1), and West Virginia (1).

Among the persons with reported dates available, illnesses began
between 25 Feb 2011 and 23 May 2011. Infected individuals range in age
from less than 1 year old to 86 years old and 44 percent of ill
persons are 5 years of age or younger. 45 percent of patients are
male. Among the 32 patients with available information, 9 (28 percent)
were hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------------
CDC, in collaboration with many state and local health departments,
state departments of agriculture, and USDA-NPIP, is investigating an
outbreak of human _S._ Altona infections linked to contact with chicks
and ducklings. Investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify
cases of illness that may be part of this outbreak. In PulseNet, the
national network of public health and food regulatory agency
laboratories coordinated by CDC, DNA is analyzed from bacteria
obtained through diagnostic testing of ill people.

In interviews, ill persons answered questions about contact with
animals and foods consumed during the week before becoming ill. 25 (81
percent) of 31 ill persons interviewed reported contact with live
poultry (chicks, chickens, ducks, ducklings, geese, and turkeys) prior
to becoming ill. Of ill persons who could recall the type of live
poultry with which they had contact, all 25 identified chicks,
ducklings, or both, and 19 out of 19 (100 percent) ill persons with
available vendor information reported purchasing chicks and ducklings
from multiple locations of a nationwide agriculture feed store, Feed
Store Chain A. Ill persons report purchasing live poultry for either
backyard flocks to produce eggs or as pets.

In May 2011, laboratory testing yielded _S._ Altona bacteria from 3
samples from a chick and its environment collected from an ill
person's household in Ohio, and 3 environmental samples collected from
chick and duckling displays at 2 locations of Feed Store Chain A in
North Carolina.

Findings of multiple traceback investigations of live chicks and
ducklings from homes of ill persons have identified a single
mail-order hatchery as the source of these chicks and ducklings.

[Since the previous CDC report, dated 25 May 2011, 14 more cases are
reported with 4 additional states involved. Adequate hand hygiene is
vital in preventing salmonellosis when handing live poultry as well as
reptiles. - Mod.LL]
