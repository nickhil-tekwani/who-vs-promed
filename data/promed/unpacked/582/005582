J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 57: 519-525.
A multi-faceted investigation was conducted in the United Arab Emirates to
characterize the epidemiologic and ecologic factors underlying an outbreak
of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) noted in November 1994 among
abattoir workers. A chart review was conducted among hospitalized suspected
cases of viral hemorrhagic fever with onset between January 1994 and March
1995 coupled with serologic testing of available specimens for the presence
of virus antigen and IgG and IgM antibodies by ELISA. Livestock handlers
and animal skin processors were interviewed and tested for the presence of
IgG antibody. Sera from imported and domestic ruminants were examined for
antibody for CCHF virus, and ticks collected from these animals were tested
with an antigen-capture ELISA. Thirty-five suspected cases of CCHF were
identified (case fatality = 62%). Livestock market employees, abattoir
workers, and animal skin processors accounted for 16 (57%) of 28 cases with
known occupational status. Serologic evidence of past asymptomatic
infection was noted in 12 (4%) of 291 livestock and abattoir workers but in
none of the controls. Nineteen (7%) of 268 animals were positive for CCHF
virus antibodies by ELISA including 12 ruminants from Somalia and Iran and
five indigenous camels. One _Hyalomma impeltatum_ and two _H. excavatum_
[ticks from Somali cattle and one _H. anatolicum_ from a Somali goat were
positive for CCHF virus antigen.
