TEGUCIGALPA--At least two Honduran children have died from hemorrhagic
dengue, sources at the Ministry of Health disclosed yesterday. Eight cases
of this often-lethal type of dengue have been recorded in Honduras since
January.
The Vice Minister of Health, Elieth Giron, confirmed that a 9-year old boy
died at a state hospital in Tegucigalpa on Monday. Earlier this year, a
girl died from the same disease in San Pedro Sula.
Another health official, Marco Antonio Pinel, said that the epidemic of
classic dengue continues spreading in this country and that the number of
cases is already over 11,000.
