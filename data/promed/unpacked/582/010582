*** Cases for which insufficient clinical information was provided.
**** Total number of human cases of WNV illness
reported to ArboNET by state and local health departments.
Neuroinvasive Disease refers to severe disease
cases, particularly West Nile meningitis and West Nile encephalitis.
West Nile fever refers to typically less severe
cases that show no evidence of neuroinvasion.
West Nile fever is not currently on the list of
nationally notifiable diseases, and therefore it
is optional whether or not state health
departments report these cases to CDC. Click the
above CDC site [URL above] for further
explanations of neuroinvasive West Nile virus disease and West Nile fever.
Other Clinical includes persons with clinical
manifestations other than WN fever, WN
encephalitis or WN meningitis, such as acute
flaccid paralysis. Unspecified cases are those
for which sufficient clinical information was not provided.
Total Human Cases Reported to CDC: These numbers
reflect both mild and severe human disease cases
occurring since 1 Jan 2006 that have been
reported to ArboNet by state and local health departments.
ArboNet is the national, electronic surveillance
system established by CDC to assist states in
tracking West Nile virus and other mosquito-borne
viruses. Information regarding 2006 virus/disease
activity is posted when such cases are reported to CDC.

[ProMED readers should note the change in URL for
the USGS/CDC weekly maps. Maps for other
arthropod-borne viruses in the USA are covered at
this site also, including St. Louis encephalitis,
Eastern equine encephalitis, Western equine
encephalitis, La Crosse encephalitis, and
Powassan. The URL for all these maps is <http://diseasemaps.usgs.gov/>.
Given the increase in WN virus transmission,
including the southern border of the USA, ProMED
requests information on West Nile virus
surveillance from Mexico and Central and South America. - Mod.TY]

[5] Washington State update
Date: 13 Sep 2006
From: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>
Source: Washington State Department of Health News Release [edited]
<http://www.doh.wa.gov/Publicat/2006_news/06-143.htm>

A Pierce County man in his forties is confirmed
as the stateï¿½s 1st human infection with West Nile
virus. Blood tests at the state Public Health
Laboratories were positive, so samples were sent
to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), which confirmed the positive result today.
The man did not travel out of the state during
the likely time he was bitten by an infected
mosquito; he developed mild symptoms -- a rash
and fever -- in July [2006], sought medical
attention in August [2006], and has recovered.
