Acute Encephalopathy Without Rash Can Be Due to Measles
-------------------------------------------------------
DELHI: Measles can present with acute encephalitis-like features minus the
rash, according to researchers in India. These findings were reported in
the June issue of Indian Pediatrics [Indian Pediatr. 2001;38:589-595
following investigation of an outbreak of fever in northern India that was
associated with altered sensorium and seizures, but no rash.
Dr. N. S. Wairagkar, from the National Institute of Virology in Pune, and
colleagues conducted serologic and viral culture studies of 22 of 51
children who were referred with fever of unknown origin in Chandigarh.
Tests for IgM antibodies to measles, dengue, Japanese encephalitis and West
Nile virus were done using ELISA in serum and cerebrospinal fluid. A total
of 27 of the children died within 2 days of the onset of encephalopathy.
IgM antibodies to measles, indicating recent infection, were detected in 17
of 28 samples tested, including 8 in the serum and 9 in CSF. Vero cell
cultures were done on all the specimens and measles virus was isolated in
6. The identity of the measles virus was confirmed using the standard
indirect immunofluorescence and neutralization tests.
2 of the samples were confirmed as measles by reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction analysis at the US Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia. The researchers note that the results
of the serologic and viral culture studies in this outbreak pointed to
measles as the causative agent. The unusual features were the severity of
the illness, absence of exposure to measles, absence of rash and occurrence
of the outbreak in seasons not common for measles. Measles in
immunocompromised patients is known to occur without a rash, but none of
these patients had features of immunodeficiency.
"Acute encephalopathy without rash can be added to the long list of
neurologic manifestations [associated with measles," the researchers
write. Episodes of acute encephalopathy without rash occur frequently in
India, they say. Co-author Dr. N. J. Shaikh, from the National Institute of
Virology, told Reuters Health that: "Studies are in progress to identify
the strains of measles virus involved in this and similar outbreaks that
have occurred in the recent past in India."

[In Feb/Mar 2001 an outbreak of a "Mystery Disease" occurred in the city of
Siliguri (North Bengal), which was characterized by a variety of signs and
symptoms including encephalitis. Ultimately the outbreak was attributed
somewhat inconclusively to infection by an atypical strain of measles
virus. The analysis of the outbreak of an unknown fever in Chadigarh (North
India) described above provides convincing evidence that outbreaks of acute
encephalopathy without rash can be associated with measles virus infection
in India. It will be interesting to establish whether the strain(s) of
measles virus associated with such outbreaks are unique to the Indian
sub-continent. - Mod.CP
