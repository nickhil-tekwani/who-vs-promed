At least 4 children have been hospitalised in the city after developing complications from hand, foot and mouth disease [HFMD].

HFMD gets its name from the non-itchy rash that develops on the palms of hands and soles of the feet. It can also cause mouth ulcers, making those who catch it feel generally unwell.

Highly contagious, the condition is common in children under 10 years of age. However, adolescents and adults can also be affected.

Generally, HFMD is a mild and short-lasting illness, and treatment is usually not needed as the body's immune system clears the virus, and symptoms go away after about 7-10 days.

The 1st symptoms include fever and feeling unwell, loss of appetite, lethargy, sore throat and small red spots in the mouth, throat and skin. The sores can be extremely painful. There may also be a rash on the soles of the feet, the palms of the hands, and occasionally on the buttocks. The rash will 1st look like flat red spots and that will then become raised and may blister.

The viruses causing it are spread through coughs or sneezes.

There is no specific treatment for the condition. As it is caused by a viral infection, it cannot be treated with antibiotics.

Symptoms can be eased by resting, drinking plenty of fluids and taking children's paracetamol to relieve pain and bring down a temperature. The pain of mouth ulcers can be numbed with anaesthetic mouthwashes or sprays.

Complications can include dehydration, infection of the sores and -- much more rarely -- viral meningitis, which is an infection of the meninges, the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. In even rarer cases, it can lead to encephalitis, an infection that causes the brain tissue to swell and become inflamed, sometimes leading to brain damage death.

As it is extremely contagious, a child diagnosed with HFMD must be kept at home until they have fully recovered.

Make sure that proper hand washing techniques are followed by everyone who comes in contact with the child infected.

[See full report at URL above for figure showing annual incidence of HFMD. There appears to be no major change in seasonal trends from previous years. According to WHO, outbreaks of HFMD occur every few years in different parts of the world, but in recent years, these have occurred more in Asia. Countries with recent large increases in the number of reported cases in Asia include: China, Japan, Hong Kong (China), Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan (China) and Viet Nam.

HFMD is most commonly caused by coxsackievirus A16, which usually results in a mild, self-limiting disease with few complications. However, HFMD is also caused by enteroviruses, including enterovirus 71 (EV71), which has been associated with serious complications and may be fatal (excerpted from http://www.wpro.who.int/emerging_diseases/hfmd.information.sheet/en/). - Mod.LK]
