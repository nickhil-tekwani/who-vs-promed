Four friends who had fished or handled crabs [photo at URL above suggests crayfish. - Mod.LL] trapped in the River Jalon, in the vicinity of Cetina (Zaragoza), have suffered an outbreak of bacterial infection, suspected to be ulceroglandular tularemia. Tularemia is a zoonotic infection caused by a Gram negative intracellular coccobacillus, _Francisella tularensis_, a highly virulent, highly transmissible and widely distributed agent, reported the Aragon Weekly Epidemiological Bulletin.

The 4 infected presented fever, general malaise and respiratory symptoms in some cases and ulcerative lesions with suppuration in the hands and axillary lymphadenopathy that began 3-5 days after exposure to the crabs, although none have required hospitalization and are progressing well with antimicrobial treatment. The health services took samples of the exudates and serology for analysis at the National Center for Microbiology.

The clinical manifestations and severity of this infection, of which person-to-person transmission has not been documented in Europe, vary depending on the route of transmission and, even with treatment, it can reach a fatality rate of 2%. Many reservoirs, vectors and environmental conditions are involved in the transmission of tularemia, and in Europe it has its highest incidence in some Scandinavian countries.

In Spain, no human cases had been reported until 1997, although transmission prior to that date was demonstrated. The largest outbreaks occurred in Castilla-Leon in 1997 and 2007, with more than 500 cases in each, the 1st by contact with hares and the 2nd after an infestation of infected voles. In 1998, an outbreak was identified in Cuenca due to the handling of crayfish, with 19 cases.

In Aragon, if the etiology of the outbreak of the 4 friends is confirmed, notified to the public health service last week, it would be the 1st detected by _F. tularensis_, although in 2014 and 2016 two cases were reported in Zaragoza, one with a history of exposure to sting of tick and another after contact with animals.

There is no vaccine available against these infections, so it is recommended to avoid drinking untreated surface water, protect yourself from arthropod bites, avoid contact with dead animals and use gloves when handling wild animals, especially when skinning hares and rabbits and the catch or washing of crayfish, cook game meat thoroughly, and handle potentially contaminated biological samples of _F. tularensis_ in biosafety level 3 laboratories.

[Although the report attributes the exposure to crabs when machine translated, the picture in the original report appears to be a crayfish. The Spanish word for crab is cangrejo and for crayfish is cangrejo de rio.

The manifestations of human tularemia vary depending on the site of inoculation, ulceroglandular refers to a local ulcerative lesion associated with regional lymphadenitis. Other forms include oroglandular, oculoglandular, pneumonia and the typhoidal form in which there is bacteremia without focal involvement. The diagnosis can be made by culture or by demonstrating a serological rise.

This report from 2001 illustrates a previous crayfish-related tularemia outbreak in Spain:

Abstract
--------
"In 1997, an outbreak of human tularemia associated with hare-hunting in central Spain affected 585 patients. We describe the identification of _Francisella tularensis_ biovar palaearctica in a 2nd outbreak of ulceroglandular tularemia associated with crayfish (_Procambarus clarkii_) fishing in a contaminated freshwater stream distant from the hare-associated outbreak. The 2nd outbreak occurred 1 year after the 1st."

Crayfish, also known as crawfish, crawdads, freshwater lobsters, or mudbugs, "are freshwater crustaceans resembling small lobsters (to which they are related).... Taxonomically, they are members of the superfamilies Astacoidea and Parastacoidea. They breathe through feather-like gills [and are found in bodies of water that do not freeze to the bottom]. Some species are found in brooks and streams, where fresh water is running, while others thrive in swamps, ditches, and paddy fields.... Crayfish feed on [living and dead] animals and plants" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crayfish).
