Suspected Hand, Foot And Mouth Disease Outbreak in Sri Lanka
-------------------------------------------------------------
COLOMBO: It was reported on Sat 21 Oct 2000 that some 150 Sri Lankan
children have contracted hand, foot and mouth disease. Dr. Dimuthu
Weerasooriya, of the Lady Ridgeway Children's Hospital in Colombo, stated
that none of those who had come to the country's main children's hospital
for treatment was serious enough to be admitted. But all carried the
disease's regular symptoms of fever, sore throat, vomiting, diarrhea, mouth
ulcers and rashes.

[Epidemics of confirmed hand, foot & mouth disease are currently affecting
children in both Malaysia and Singapore, attributed variously to infection
by Enterovirus 71, Echovirus 7, and possibly other enteroviruses.
Information on the virological aspects of this probable Sri Lankan outbreak
of hand, foot & mouth disease are awaited with interest. - Mod.CP
