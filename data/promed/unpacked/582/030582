Poland imports again Dutch poultry
-----------------------------------
Poland has reopened its borders for Dutch poultry, though ducks and
chickens from Groningen and Utrecht are still banned. Singapore, a minor
customer, has discontinued the import of Dutch poultry for fear of fowl
plague. This was announced by the Product Boards for Livestock, Meat and
Eggs (PVE) on Monday. This means that the trade with Poland has been
recovered to a major part, since Poland agrees that the safety of poultry
from all provinces, excluding Utrecht and Groningen, has been secured.
Russia, Poland, and Japan last week banned imports of Dutch poultry,
following the detection of avian influenza (AI) on 2 holdings. The Russian
decision, in particular, is damaging for the sector; during 2002, the
Russian market represented 10 percent of Netherlands' poultry exports.
The PVE argues that Dutch farmers are being punished for good behaviour.
Since the major AI in 2003, Netherlands has adopted severe measures to
control the virus. This, says the PVE, is the cause of frequent detections
of non-pathogenic virus variants. Some countries decide, in such cases, to
unjustifiably closing their borders -- says the spokesman. The PVE is
currently discussing with Russia an early end to the ban.

There is now ample evidence that importing countries are willing to embargo
poultry products based solely on serological evidence of
influenza. Because influenza is endemic in wild waterfowl, any
poultry-exporting country that monitors waterfowl of any type that has
contact with wild birds is putting its exporting industry at risk. Once a
country starts finding serological evidence of influenza in waterfowl, how
does that country ever prove that they are "free?"
Waterfowl and shorebirds are one of the reservoirs of
influenza. Monitoring them and not finding influenza would be suspect.
Finding influenza is to be expected in this population.
If poultry-importing countries wish to embargo product because of
serological evidence of avian influenza, then countries that wish to export
should carefully review their monitoring plans.

[The recent, painful Dutch experience illustrates clearly the point raised
by Dave Halvorson; if refraining from surveillance becomes the rewarding
policy, there will be no progress in international efforts to detect and
contain diseases such as avian influenza. Dave's comment deserves the
attention of the international animal-health community and the relevant
organisations. - Mod.AS]
