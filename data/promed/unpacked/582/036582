Tests Confirm Fifth Human Case of West Nile Virus Infection in New Jersey
------------------------------------------------------
TRENTON: Laboratory testing and analysis completed this week by the [US
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have confirmed that a
fifth New Jersey resident was infected with the West Nile virus this past
summer.
The resident, a 76 year-old Dover Township (Morris County) woman with
underlying medical conditions, was admitted to St. Clare's Hospital on 27
Aug 2000 with symptoms of encephalitis including fever, headache and
confusion. Her condition slowly improved, she was transferred to a
rehabilitation center and is presently residing in a nursing home.
Department of Health and Senior Services' [DHSS Public Health and
Environmental Laboratory testing completed on 21 Sep 2000 showed weak
positivity for West Nile virus. Testing by the CDC on a subsequent
specimen taken in October was inconclusive and a third sample was taken and
sent to the CDC in November. The CDC confirmed the case as positive on Thu
21 Dec 2000.
West Nile virus, an arbovirus [genus _Flavivirus_, family _Flaviviridae_,
is transmitted through the bite of a mosquito that has picked up the virus
by feeding on an infected bird. West Nile virus is not directly
transmitted from birds to humans or from person to person. West Nile virus
infection generally causes no symptoms or just mild, flu-like symptoms;
however, the elderly are at higher risk of more severe disease. In total,
55 residents met West Nile virus testing criteria and of those, 5 tested
positive, 45 were negative, 4 are pending and 1 individual declined testing.
In addition to human cases, birds, horses and mosquitoes also tested
positive for West Nile virus this year. The New Jersey DHSS, Environmental
Protection and Agriculture, and other federal, state, county and local
health and mosquito control agencies are currently assessing strategies and
actions taken this year to make modifications and improvements for reducing
the risk of human and animal exposure to West Nile virus in 2001.
