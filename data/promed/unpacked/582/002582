Anthrax made a comeback in the tribal areas of Visakhapatnam district [Andhra Pradesh]. On [Mon 2 Apr 2018] morning, 2 people from Godugumamidi village in Chintapalle mandal of Visakhapatnam agency were admitted to King George Hospital for suspected skin lesions of anthrax on their hands.

According to an inquiry by the officials of district Health & Medical department, the villagers had slaughtered and skinned a dead cow. Furthermore, the meat was consumed by the entire village. The district administration then deputed the Animal Husbandry staff to Godugumamidi village.

The staff interacted with the villagers and on enquiry it was found that the cow was suspected to have died of a snake-bite about 10 days back. Teams were formed and anthrax vaccination was administered to the people in the village and also in 7 adjacent villages in about 10 km [approx. 6 mi] radius. Teams are being deputed to conduct vaccination in 3 more surrounding villages.

[There were livestock anthrax outbreaks in Chintapalle mandal last year [2017], see 28 Dec 2017 Anthrax - India (19): (AD) humans, confirmed 20171228.5525756 and 26 Dec 2017 Anthrax - India (18): (AD) humans, susp 20171226.5523330. The basic fact of controlling this disease is the need for proactive vaccination, not reactive vaccination. It is far more cost effective to prevent outbreaks than to tidy up the mess afterwards.

This report indicates that humans were vaccinated. I think that this is just poor journalism. The vaccination response comes after the Animal Husbandry staff was deployed and the investigation initiated. Thus livestock in the index village was being carried out and in 10 surrounding villages.

Andhra Pradesh is in SE India; see: http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/india_physio-2001.jpg and HealthMap/ProMED-mail map see: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=5726461,297. To find Chintapalle Mandal see: https://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/andhrapradesh/. - Mod.MHJ]
