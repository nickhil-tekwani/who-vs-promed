The number of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) cases as of mid-June 2015 has exceeded 14 000, nearly 50 per cent higher than during a similar period last year [2014]. However, doctors say this is not a cause for major concern, given that most cases are relatively mild strains of the virus. The figures saw an early rise from early April 2015, peaking at 1004 cases in the 1st week of May 2015 before easing off.

A Ministry of Health (MOH) spokesperson, noting that HFMD is a common childhood disease that is endemic to Singapore, said on Tue 16 Jun 2015 that "increases in cases can be expected from time to time." The spokesperson added: "The predominant circulating strains this year [2015] are coxsackieviruses type A, which typically cause mild disease. No severe cases or deaths due to HFMD have been reported in the past 3 years."

As of 13 Jun 2015, 14 237 HFMD cases were reported to MOH. In comparison, 9684 cases were reported between January and 7 Jun last year [2014]. Of this year's [2015] cases, 72 per cent were patients aged below 7.

"The key to controlling outbreaks of infectious diseases such as HFMD is the early detection and isolation of cases (children with HFMD should stay at home till they are well), and the maintenance of high levels of personal and environmental hygiene," the spokesperson said.

Meanwhile, general practitioners told the press they had seen slight increases in HFMD cases recently, compared with a year ago. Dr Sunil Joseph of Tayka Medical Family Clinic in Jurong said the cases he had attended to so far were "mild cases, where the strain of the virus is not too virulent."

While several parents expressed concern over the increase in HFMD cases, they told journalists they were confident their children's schools could handle the matter effectively. A parent who has a daughter in kindergarten said: "We are trusting the school to provide us with updates on suspected HFMD cases so we as parents can take precautions accordingly."

Several kindergartens and childcare centres noted isolated cases of HFMD on their premises. However, they added that they had protocols -- such as temperature and health checks -- in place, along with regular sanitation practices.

[Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common infectious disease of infants and children. It is characterized by fever, painful sores in the mouth, and a rash with blisters on hands, feet and also buttocks. It is prevalent in many Asian countries. Outbreaks of HFMD occur every few years in different parts of the world, but in recent years, these have occurred more in Asia. Countries with recent large increases in the numbers of reported cases in Asia include: China, Japan, Hong Kong (China), Republic of Korea (South Korea), Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan and Viet Nam. HFMD outbreaks have been frequent in Singapore and neighbouring countries and are probably indicative of common features of rearing of children.

Viruses from the group called enteroviruses cause HFMD. There are many different types in the group, including polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses and other enteroviruses. HFMD is most commonly caused by coxsackievirus A16, which usually results in a mild, self-limiting disease with few complications. However, HFMD is also caused by other enteroviruses, including enterovirus 71 (EV71), which has been associated with serious complications and may be fatal.

It is difficult to make useful comparisons of epidemics affecting different societies. - Mod.CP
