Mystery shrouds the death of over 100 Indian Pond Herons, listed under Schedule IV of the Wildlife Protection Act 1972, inside the green premises of Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) regional office behind Ganeshpeth ST Stand.

Jyoti Bharati, law officer at MSRTC's divisional office, who 1st noticed the deaths near the quarters, said the birds with twisted necks would suddenly collapse from the trees and die a painful death, flapping their wings.

"Attempts to revive the birds by giving them water and food by the staff and security guards failed. We were dumbfounded to see the birds dying mysteriously before any help could reach them," said Bharati.

She also carried some dead birds to a veterinary polyclinic where doctors also could not come up with exact cause of death. Poisoning and pesticides as suspected reasons have been ruled out.

The deaths started in early February [2014]. "Two weeks ago, I finally contacted Kavita Rattan of NGO Green Vigil and subsequently Wild-CER's Dr Bahar Baviskar. By then, many birds, including chicks, had died. An average of 4 birds died daily. More than 100 must have died by now," Bharati said.

Her claims were confirmed by a driver [who had worked] in the regional office since 2001. "The birds have been seen here for over a decade, but we never saw such deaths," he said, and showed at least 10 dead birds lying in the premises.

A security officer said, "Initially we thought the deaths might be due to hailstorm followed by strong winds. But they have continued."

Post-mortem was performed on 2 carcasses, but veterinarians are not sure about the cause of death. Wildlife vet Dr Baviskar, who treated some of the birds, said none survived. "Post-mortem performed by Dr Nitin Kurkure of pathology department at Nagpur Veterinary College on 2 birds reported the avians died of starvation," said Dr Baviskar.

However, he said the deaths could be due to outbreak of Newcastle disease virus (NDV), one of the avian paramyxoviruses. Two years ago, several pond herons had died in Gondia district due to a similar syndrome.

Raptor scientist Dr Ajay Poharkar of National Association for Welfare of Animals and Research (NAWAR), who had detected similar deaths of vultures in Gadchiroli, has decided to probe the cause of deaths and remedy. He reached the spot and collected a carcass. He said more might be needed to establish the cause.

"Prima facie, it doesn't look like avian malaria. As of now, it can only be called 'ailments of unknown aetiology,'" Dr Poharkar said.

[The Indian Pond Heron (_Ardeola grayii_) breeds in southern Iran and east to Pakistan, India, Burma, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. They are very common in India, and are usually solitary foragers, but numbers of them may sometimes feed in close proximity during the dry seasons. The Indian Pond Heron's feeding habitat is marshy wetlands. The primary food of these birds includes crustaceans, aquatic insects, fishes, tadpoles and sometimes leeches.
