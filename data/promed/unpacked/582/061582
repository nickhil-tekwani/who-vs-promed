A 25-year-old woman has died of bird flu in Egypt, the country's
health ministry spokesman said on Wed 26 Dec 2007. According to the
ministry, the woman who contracted the virus in the Beni Suweif
province 130 km south of the capital Cairo was hospitalized last
Friday [21 Dec 2007] with a fever and breathing difficulties.
Abdul Rahman Shahin said this was the 16th victim of the deadly H5N1
bird flu virus since the 1st case was reported in the Middle Eastern
country in February 2006. Of 39 Egyptians infected with bird flu,
mostly women and children who contracted the virus after coming into
contact with infected poultry, 16 have died.
A total of 207 deaths have been registered worldwide by the World
Health Organization (WHO) since 2003. Although no cases of
human-to-human transmission of avian influenza have been reported,
scientists fear the virus could mutate into a strain that could pass
easily from person to person, causing a global pandemic.

[4] Viet Nam, suspected

Doctors suspect bird flu may have killed a 4-year-old child in
northern Viet Nam, state-run radio said on Wed 26 Dec 2007. A Health
Ministry official told a government meeting on Tue 25 Dec 2007 the
child had a fever and serious pneumonia after eating chicken that had
died of unknown causes in the mountainous province of Son La, the
Voice of Vietnam radio said. It said the child died in a hospital in
Hanoi but gave no gender. Doctors were testing to see whether the
H5N1 bird flu virus was the killer, the ministry official was quoted as saying.
Viet Nam last reported outbreaks among poultry in October 2007, but
Son La was not on the government's bird flu watch list. The H5N1
virus killed 4 of the 7 Vietnamese who have caught it this year
[2007], taking the country's death toll since late 2003 to 46. The
last death was reported in August [2007].
Health officials had worried that winter in northern Viet Nam might
trigger a new wave of outbreaks among poultry, as the virus seems to
thrive best in cool temperatures. The Agriculture Ministry said 63 of
Viet Nam's 64 provinces had been vaccinating birds against the virus
this year [2007]. The H5N1 virus remains mainly a virus of birds, but
experts fear it could mutate into a form easily transmitted from
person to person and sweep the world, killing millions. Globally, the
H5N1 virus has killed 209 people out of 340 known cases, and most of
the deaths are in Indonesia, followed by Viet Nam, World Health
Organisation figures show. Hundreds of millions of birds have died or
been slaughtered.
