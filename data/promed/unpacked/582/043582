In Haiti, from the beginning of the epidemic to 9 Jul 2012, the total of cholera cases reached 579 014, of which 313 226 (54 percent) were hospitalized, and 7418 died. The global case-fatality rate is 1.3 percent, and the hospitalized case-fatality rate is 1.5 percent. From epidemiological week (EW) 15 of 2012, an increase of cases was principally recorded in the departments of Artibonite, Centre, Nord, Nord-Est and Ouest. The increase is related to the early onset of the rainy season. In the past 4 weeks, the number of cases and hospitalizations has shown a decreasing trend.

In the Dominican Republic, the total of suspected cholera cases reported since the beginning of the epidemic through epidemiological week (EW) 26 of 2012 is 25 767, of which 19 327 (75 percent) were hospitalized, and 411 died. The fatality rate recorded from EW 1 to EW 26 of 2012 is 0.8 percent. During EW 26, there were no new deaths, and the provinces that saw the greatest increase in cases were San Juan and Santiago. From EW 15 of 2012, an increase in cases and hospitalizations was recorded, with the greatest increase registered in the municipality of Tamboril as a result of an outbreak associated with damage to the main aqueducts system. The provinces on red alert this week are Santiago, Puerto Plata and Barahona.

In Cuba, on 13 Jul 2012, the International Health Regulation (IHR) National Focal Point (NFP) reported that to date a total of 137 confirmed cases of _V. cholerae_, including 3 deaths, had been registered. All of these cases were registered in the municipality of Manzanillo in the Granma province and were characterized as toxigenic _V. cholerae_, serogroup O1, serotype Ogawa, biotype El Tor. There have been no further deaths since the initial report on 3 Jul 2012.

All cases have been treated at medical clinics, polyclinics, or the Manzanillo General Hospital and Pediatric Hospital. The health facilities have the capacity to attend the cases rapidly, and there has been no overcrowding; there has been no impact on health services. The outbreak has remained confined to the initial area, and no extension or dissemination has occurred in the rest of the country.

Control measures implemented in the municipality of Manzanillo include ensuring that water is safe for drinking, distribution of drinkable water by mobile tanks, implementation of environmental sanitation measures, food safety control measures, and public health awareness campaigns with an emphasis on hand washing hygiene, consumption of safe foods, and drinkable water. Furthermore, an active case search is underway in the municipality of Manzanillo. The national epidemiological surveillance system has been activated with particular attention to acute diarrheal disease cases.

Recommendations
The PAHO/WHO recalls that the following recommendations continue to be applicable:

Surveillance
------------
Under the International Health Regulations (2005), public health events that involve the risk of cholera cases should be evaluated on the basis of Annex 2 of the IHR, and -- in accordance with it -- the WHO Contact Point for IHR should be notified.

The surveillance of cholera should be part of an integrated surveillance system of a country and should include timely feedback to information at both local and global levels. It is recommended to use the WHO standardized case definition to obtain a more precise estimation of the cholera burden at the global level in order to define more sustainable support strategies.

In countries where no cholera cases have been reported, the following is recommended:
- Monitor the trend of acute diarrhea diseases with an emphasis on adults.
- Immediate notification of all suspected cases from the local to the central and peripheral level.
- Investigation of all suspected cases and clusters.
- Laboratory confirmation of all suspected cases.

In an outbreak situation, the following measures are recommended:
- Intensified surveillance with the inclusion of active case finding.
- Laboratory confirmation to monitor the geographic spread and the resistance pattern.
- Weekly analysis of the number of cases and deaths by age, sex, geographical location and hospital admission.

[2] CDC Travel Notice for Cuba
Date: Fri 27 Jul 2012
Source: CDC Travel Notices [edited]

The Cuban Ministry of Health has confirmed the 1st cholera outbreak in Cuba in more than a century. 137 confirmed cases and 3 deaths have been reported in Granma province in the cities of Manzanillo, Bayamo, Yara, and Campechuela Niquero. Currently, cases are limited to Granma Province, mostly in Manzanillo. According to the Cuban Ministry of Public Health, control measures have been implemented including ensuring that water is safe for drinking, implementation of environmental sanitation measures and public awareness campaigns. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) is also closely monitoring this situation.

Most travelers are not at high risk of getting cholera. However, travelers to an area with a known outbreak should take steps to avoid getting sick. The vaccine to prevent cholera is not available in the USA.

Cholera is a bacterial disease that can cause diarrhea and dehydration. Cholera is most often spread through the ingestion of contaminated food or drinking water. Water may be contaminated by the feces of an infected person or by untreated sewage. Food can be contaminated by water containing cholera bacteria or by being handled by a person ill with cholera.

Travelers can prevent cholera by following these 5 basic steps:

- Drink and use safe water. Bottled water with unbroken seals and canned or bottled carbonated beverages are safe to drink and use.
- Use safe water to brush your teeth, wash and prepare food, and make ice.
- Clean food preparation areas and kitchenware with soap and safe water and let dry completely before reuse.

(Piped water sources, drinks sold in cups or bags, or ice may not be safe. All drinking water and water used to make ice should be boiled or treated with chlorine.)

To be sure water is safe to drink and use:

- Boil it or treat it with water purification tablets, a chlorine product, or household bleach.
- Bring your water to a complete boil for at least 1 minute.
- To treat your water, use water purification tablets -- brought with you from the United States or a locally available treatment product -- and follow the instructions.
- If a chlorine treatment product is not available, you can treat your water with household bleach. Add 8 drops of household bleach for every one gallon of water (or 2 drops of household bleach for every one liter of water), and wait 30 minutes before drinking.

Always store your treated water in a clean, covered container.

Wash your hands often with soap and safe water.
- Before you eat or prepare food
- Before feeding your children
- After using the bathroom
- After changing diapers
- After taking care of someone ill with diarrhea

(If no soap is available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer (containing at least 60 percent alcohol).

Use toilets; do not defecate in any body of water.
- Use toilets, latrines, or other sanitation systems, such as chemical toilets, to dispose of feces.
- Wash hands with soap and safe water after using the bathroom.
- Clean toilets and surfaces contaminated with feces by using a solution of one part household bleach to 9 parts water.

Cook food well (especially seafood); keep it covered; eat it hot, and peel fruits and vegetables.
- Boil it, cook it, peel it, or leave it.
- Be sure to cook shellfish (such as crabs and crayfish) until they are very hot all the way through.
- Do not bring perishable seafood back to the USA.
(Avoid raw foods other than fruits and vegetables you have peeled yourself.)

[The outbreak on the island of Hispaniola continues at a slower rate than previously, but it is likely that the organism will become endemic on the island and increase in numbers during the rainy season.

The USA has now issued a travel notice regarding the outbreak of cholera in Cuba, 15 days after Canada issued such a notice. - Mod.LL
