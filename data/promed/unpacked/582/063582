["_M. refringens_ is a protistan parasite belonging to the paramyxean group affecting the epithelial cells of the gut or gills of _O. edulis_ causing the disease known as Marteiliosis.

"The complex life cycle begins with an initial infection of the epithelial cells of the gills where the parasite then migrates to the digestive-gland epithelium and onto the gut lumen before being released. Infected oysters may shed large numbers of parasite before they die.

"The development of the disease is related to water temperature and in France mortalities in infected stocks start in the early summer as the water temperature raises, peak in August and decrease over the winter as the water temperature drops.

"In France the mortalities coincide with seasonal changes; Marteiliosis begins in May and peaks between June and August, after which there is a decrease over the winter months and the parasite then remains quiescent from February to April. However in Dutch waters oyster stocks remain unaffected despite the presence of _M. refringens_. To date the absence of mortalities in these shellfish is unexplained.

"Whilst the exact mode of infection of _M. refringens_ is unknown, it is thought it may be transmitted horizontally from infected shellfish through the water column, and taken up passively across the gills of susceptible stock. However, there is no experimental evidence to support direct horizontal transmission of _M. refringens_, and alternate theories suggest that intermediate hosts, or free-living stages, may be part of the parasites life cycle. Recent studies have implicated free living copepods in the transmission of the parasite to oysters."

Infection with _Marteilia refringens_ covers infection with _M. refringens_ including types M and O. http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=2439&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_marteilia_refringens.htm

Marteiliosis due to _Marteilia refringens_ occurs in Europe where it infects flat oysters, _Ostrea edulis_ and mussels, _Mytilus edulis_ and _M. galloprovincialis_. Type M is more often detected in mussels and type O in flat oysters, however co-infection exists. This last event seems to be restricted to areas where the prevalence of the disease is high. http://www.eurl-mollusc.eu/Scientific-activities/Marteilia-refringens. - Mod.CRD
