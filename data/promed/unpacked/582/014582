A Korean-made rice product is being recalled because of concerns it may allow the growth of a bacterium that causes botulism.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency [CFIA] says Rice Porridge with Abalone from Korea Food Trading Ltd. is sold in Ontario and New Brunswick but may also have been distributed in other provinces. The product is sold in a round 288-gram container featuring Korean characters with a code reading 2015-01-24. The federal health agency says anyone who has the product should throw it out or return it to the store where it was purchased.

Food contaminated with the toxin (_Clostridium botulinum_) may not look or smell spoiled but can still make you sick. The CFIA says symptoms can include nausea, vomiting, fatigue, dizziness, blurred or double vision, dry mouth, respiratory failure and paralysis. In severe cases of illness, people may die.

There have been no reported illnesses associated with the consumption of this product.

[Abalone is (http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/abalone) a large mollusk of the genus _Haliotis_, having a bowl-like shell bearing a row of respiratory holes, the flesh of which is used for food and the shell for ornament and as a source of mother-of-pearl.

Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most of the food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures, which could, but not necessarily do, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_. - Mod.LL
