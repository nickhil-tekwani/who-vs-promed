A report from the BBC [see [2] below) quoting a paper in the journal
Science (reference below) implicates bats as the likely reservoir host for
the SARS virus, and not the much maligned civet cat which apparently acted
as the amplification host. To be more precise, the authors implicate 3
species of horseshoe bat of the genus _Rhinolophus_.
I have done some initial research and can only find reference to horseshoe
bats in PNG [Papua New Guinea] but other reports state that they are
present in a number of Pacific Islands without specifying which
ones. Would subscribers to Pacvet [or others] please let us know whether
horseshoe bats occur in their countries and territories and if possible
which species?

The likely source of the respiratory disease SARS is the horseshoe bat, a
new study suggests. Researchers found a virus closely related to the SARS
coronavirus in bats from 3 regions of China. Writing in the journal
Science, they say the virus may have needed to infect another animal such
as the civet before it could transmit to humans. They suggest that live
horseshoe bats [should be] kept out of markets until the transmission path
is fully understood.
The SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak in 2002/3 caused
about 770 deaths, and economic damage estimated in billions of dollars;
centred on east Asia with origins in southern China, fatalities occurred as
far afield as Canada. The virus we found is 92 percent similar to the human
SARS virus. Schools and businesses closed, international trade and travel
were restricted; and for a time, until basic public health measures
curtailed the outbreak, it seemed as though the next major global disease
of humanity had emerged.
But it emerged from where? In May 2003, the suggestion emerged that the
virus responsible had entered the human population from civets, animals
eaten in wildlife restaurants and butchered in live animal markets in
southern China. The World Health Organisation (WHO) endorsed this link
early in 2004, an announcement which led authorities in China to embark on
a culling programme which saw an estimated 10 000 civets killed, as well as
other animals suspected of harbouring SARS virus, such as badgers and raccoons.
But for some time, the prevailing theory among scientists has been that
civets were not the original source, or reservoir, of infection. One clue
is that they appear to have little immunity, and become seriously ill;
whereas species which harbour pathogens for a long period of history
usually adapt to them. So where did the SARS virus come from? One theory
named birds; but earlier this month, researchers at Hong Kong University
found cause to suspect bats. In a Hong Kong bat species they found a virus
closely related to that found in SARS patients.
Now an international collaboration between scientists in China, Australia
and the US has gone further, and identified a SARS-like [coronavirus] in 3
species of bats from mainland China. "The virus we found is 92 percent
similar to the human SARS virus," said Zhengli Shi from the Institute of
Zoology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing. "Why it is there in
these bats, why it can infect just these species, we are not sure -- it is
a story we want to discuss," she told BBC News.
All 3 species of bat in which Dr Shi's group found the SARS-like
coronavirus, are horseshoe bats of the genus _Rhinolophus_, as does the
species identified in the Hong Kong study. Genomic analysis suggests that
the bat coronaviruses found by this group and by the Hong Kong team are
very alike, and that both are closely related to the human and civet forms.
The major differences lie in genes which relate to the binding of virus
particle and the host cell. "This virus, we are sure, cannot infect
humans," said Zhengli Shi. One of the big questions is, then, how the virus
jumped from bats to humans -- and whether in the body of an intermediary,
such as the civet, it can adapt in such a way that it can then infect a
human. "At the moment we don't know," said Peter Daszak, Director of the
Consortium for Conservation Medicine in New York, who was also involved in
the study.
So civets could be an "amplifier host" for SARS. If they are, one
suggestion, according to Peter Daszak, is to keep them away from horseshoe
bats. "In the east Asian region, we need to face up to high-risk
behaviours," he said, "and in this situation, bringing these species into
live markets, butchering and eating them and using them in medicines, is a
high-risk behaviour."
WHO spokesperson Dick Thompson told BBC News: "We see this as another piece
of the SARS jigsaw. "There's an unfinished agenda for SARS, and clearly we
need to understand the disease ecology better." Confirming horseshoe bats
as the source of SARS would carry implications for future public health
research and policy. "These bats have a wide distribution in Europe and
Asia," said Peter Daszak, "and what we don't know, and need to know
urgently, is the distribution of the SARS-like coronavirus in these bats.
The last thing we should do is to take it out on the bats, because the
evidence suggests that they have carried this coronavirus for thousands,
perhaps millions of years; only recently has it emerged in a big way, and
it was human behaviours that made the difference."
