New Caledonia: influenza B virus circulation increasing
---------------------------------------------------
The influenza B virus currently circulating in New-Zealand [see: Influenza
B virus - New Zealand 20050622.1755] is also the only virus isolated in New
Caledonia since the beginning of 2005. Although limited, the circulation
has been increasing significantly since mid-May. To date no severe cases
have been reported.
All isolated strains have been identified as B/Shanghai/361/2002, using the
2005 CDC reagent kit. A set of representative strains is shortly to be sent
to the WHO-CC in Melbourne for further characterization.
Other foci in the region may occur soon, and insular countries with
frequent links with New Zealand should be on alert.
