Viet Nam: New suspected Human Case of Avian Influenza Virus Infection
---------------------------------------------------
A 16-month-old boy from Vietnam's central Quang Binh province has
been hospitalized on suspicion of having contracted avian influenza A
(H5N1) virus infection, according to the local newspaper Pioneer on
Thu 24 Mar 2005. The boy from Chau Hoa commune, Tuyen Hoa district,
was admitted to a hospital in Hue central city on Tue 22 Mar 2005.
Also, a woman from the commune is being closely monitored in her
residential area since she has a light fever and breathing
difficulty. She is the aunt of a 13-year-old girl who was reported by
local media to have died of avian influenza 9 Mar 2005. [It has not
been confirmed that the 13-year-old's death was due to H5N1 virus
infection, because no clinical samples were retained for laboratory
analysis. - Mod.CP] The sick girl was cared for by her aunt. The
13-year-old girl's 5-year-old brother was confirmed to have
contracted H5N1 virus infection last week. He is now recovering after
being treated in the Hue-based hospital since 15 Mar 2005. The sister
and the brother ate chicken before exhibiting bird flu symptoms.
Now, some 200 residents of the commune have ordinary influenza. [This
has been denied by the Vietnamese Ministry of Health, but see
following report - Mod.CP] Avian influenza outbreaks [in poultry]
were reported in the area in early February 2005. To deal with the
situation, Vietnam has sent more health and veterinary officials to
probe into suspected cases and work out concrete preventive measures.
Over 1000 fowl in the commune have been culled.

influenza virus infection on Mon 21 Mar 2005; see "Avian influenza,

Viet Nam: Investigation of Influenza Outbreak in Quang Binh Province
--------------------------------------------------
Vietnamese health experts are investigating an outbreak in which
scores of people are suffering flu-like symptoms in the same central
region where a 5-year-old boy was infected with avian flu nearly 2
weeks ago, officials said. The 6 experts were sent to Quang Binh
province to gather specimens from patients experiencing high fever,
coughing and breathing difficulties after initial reports 195 people
were experiencing flu-like symptoms, said Dinh Sy Hien, deputy
director of the Pasteur Institute in Nha Trang, which sent 3 team
members. He said the initial figure could have been exaggerated
because villagers panicked when they learned about the boy's
infection. The news may have triggered a psychological response that
made people experience false symptoms, he said on Wed 23 Mar 2005.
However, the World Health Organization is monitoring the situation
and has a quarantine plan in place if a large number of people test
positive for avian influenza virus infection, said Hans Troedsson,
WHO country director. He said a team of international experts also
could be sent to the area quickly if needed. But Troedsson said other
illnesses, such as other types of influenza and dengue fever, must be
ruled out first.
Avian flu has killed at least 13 Vietnamese and one Cambodian since
late December 2004. Cambodia's health minister announced Thursday an
additional Cambodian is believed to have died of the disease [see
ProMED-mail post: "Avian influenza, human - East Asia (56):
Cambodia".]
More than 1.5 million birds have died or been slaughtered so far in
2005. Experts have warned that avian flu could pose a greater threat
to human health if the virus mutates and becomes easily transmissible
among people. However, there has been no evidence the virus has
changed and most human cases have been traced to contact with sick
poultry.
The 5-year-old boy from Kinh Chau commune was taken to hospital 12
Mar 2005 with avian flu symptoms, 3 days after his 13-year-old sister
died after experiencing a high fever and breathing difficulties. She
was never tested for avian influenza. The boy's uncle told
authorities the family ate a chicken after it became sick and died, a
practice that was common in the village. The boy remained in stable
condition and was continuing to improve, a doctor at the hospital
said.
All of the poultry in the commune have been destroyed, but test
results are not yet available, said Truong Dinh Dinh, director of the
Quang Binh Preventative Medicine Centre. No quarantine restrictions
have been put in place and Dinh said all chicken farms have been
disinfected.
