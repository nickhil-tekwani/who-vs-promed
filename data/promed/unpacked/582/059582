[1] Mixed influenza A and SARS-CoV-2
Date: Thu 6 Jan 2022
From: Effrossyni Gkrania-Klotsas <effrossyni.gkrania-klotsas@addenbrookes.nhs.uk> [edited]


We have seen the 1st convincing case of "flurona" in the UK -- an immunosuppressed patient with a biphasic illness, initially with confirmed COVID-19 alone and then with a superinfection with influenza A H1. Mixed infections are more common than we think and we need to be looking for them, as we can treat/modify both but giving treatment only for SARS-CoV-2 might be detrimental.

[ProMED thanks Effrossyni Gkrania-Klotsas for this report. It should be noted co-infection with influenza and COVID also was reported on 5 Jan 2022 in Los Angeles, CA in a case involving a teenager detected 4 days ago [1 Jan 2022] at a testing site near the Getty Center in Brentwood, reported Steve Farzam, chief operating officer of 911 COVID Testing (https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-01-05/l-a-county-detects-first-flurona-case-combination-of-flu-covid). The teen had just returned from a family vacation in Mexico.

Another case has been reported in Israel in a young pregnant woman who was already in hospital, although her symptoms are said to be mild (https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/flurona-covid-variant-what-symptoms-b1987848.html). - Mod.LK]

[2] Comment: COVID in young adults
Date: Thu 6 Jan 2022
From: Joseph Dudley <jpdudley@alaska.edu> [edited]


The epidemiological importance of individuals in the 20- to 30-year-old age cohort has been systematically underestimated by most public health analysts throughout the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, despite ample evidence from the 1st wave of the pandemic in 2020 that individuals in this age-group were showing high rates of infection.

Early COVID-19 surveillance data from Korea from January-March 2020 (1), as well as subsequent published data from several other countries, have shown the highest percentage/absolute number of total positive cases was detected among individuals in the 20- to 30-year-old age cohort.

Data from the 1st wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan all show the highest percentage of reported COVID-19 infections among young adults in the 20- to 29-year-old age cohort. This same trend is evident in published testing data from the United States for the period during May-August 2020 (2).

The low relative frequency of symptomatic disease from COVID-19 infections among children and young adults, coupled with limited testing and/or reporting of test data from asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections, has hindered recognition of the potentially key importance of children and young adults in the epidemiological dynamics of COVID-19 transmission at the community level.

There is increasing evidence that individuals younger than 30 years of age may be playing a highly significant role in the facilitation and amplification of COVID-19 transmission. Clarifying and understanding the epidemiological dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission among individuals in younger age cohorts will help in determining control strategies at the individual and population levels.

Greater recognition of the potential for high rates of infection among young adults can help improve the development and implementation of effective measures to contain and mitigate the public health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic globally.

[3] Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine: waning efficacy in adolescents
Date: Thu 6 Jan 2022

Yesterday [5 Jan 2022] a new preprint study out of Israel showed the efficacy of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine waned in 12- to 17-year-olds in a similar pattern seen in adult recipients. Within 5 months after completing the initial 2-dose vaccinations series, protection against infection with SARS-CoV-2 dropped to 58%. The study was published on the preprint server medRxiv (https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.01.04.22268776).

The study took place between 15 Jun 2021 and 8 Dec 2021, when the delta variant became the dominant strain in Israel. Cases were patients ages 12-16 who had a positive PCR test. The study participants included 129 909 patients served by Maccabi Healthcare Services (MHS), the 2nd-largest healthcare organization in Israel.

Overall, vaccinated adolescents had a notably lower percent of tests that were positive for COVID-19, the authors said, with 6.6% of tests among unvaccinated individuals coming back positive, compared with less than 1.4% for those who received their 2nd dose 14-149 days before the test, and 3.6% for those who received their 2nd dose more than 150 days before the test.

The peak protection provided by the vaccine was between 2 weeks and 3 months after the 2nd dose, and the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection was subsequently reduced to 75% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 71% to 79%) and 58% (95% CI: 52% to 64%) 90-149 days and 150-180 days following receipt of the 2nd dose, respectively.

"Long-term protection conferred by the vaccine was reduced 75% to 78% against infection and symptomatic infection, respectively, 3-5 months after the 2nd dose, and waned to 58% against infection and 65% against COVID-19 after 5 months," the authors said.

[4] Omicron: case surge
Date: Thu 6 Jan 2022

With COVID-19 cases now rising in all the world's regions, nearly 9.5 million cases were reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) last week, the most of any week during the pandemic, the group's director-general said today [6 Jan 2022]. And this week's cases are poised to top last week's, by far. Yesterday [5 Jan 2022], the WHO recorded the most daily cases since the start of the pandemic, more than 2 million cases.

At a briefing, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, urged leaders not to underestimate the omicron variant, which is fueling much of the rise. Though the variant appears to be less severe, it shouldn't be considered mild, he said (https://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---6-january-2022).

"Just like previous variants, omicron is hospitalizing people and it is killing people. In fact, the tsunami of cases is so huge and quick, that it is overwhelming health systems around the world," Tedros said, adding that overcrowded and understaffed hospitals are contributing to preventable deaths, both from COVID-19 and other diseases that require timely treatment.

In its weekly situation report on the pandemic today [6 Jan 2022], the WHO said the Americas and Southeast Asian regions reported the biggest spikes compared to the previous week, up 100% and 78%, respectively (https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/weekly-epidemiological-update-on-covid-19---6-january-2022).

In the Americas, countries reporting the biggest rises included the United States, Argentina, and Canada. In Southeast Asia, India, Thailand, and Sri Lanka reported the biggest jumps. In the Eastern Mediterranean region, countries registering the largest increases last week include Morocco, Kuwait, and Bahrain. And in Europe, Montenegro, Greece, and Cyprus saw the tallest spikes. Meanwhile in the WHO's Western Pacific region, Australia reported the biggest rise last week, while in Africa, Mozambique and Ethiopia led the increases.

Deaths, however, declined by 10% compared to the week before.

Tedros said it's crucial for countries and manufacturers to take more steps to speed up the vaccine rollout to lower-income countries, and he said he is encouraged trials are underway on vaccines for which developers have already committed to waive patent rights.

In a related development, India last week granted an emergency use authorization for Corbevax, a protein subunit vaccine developed at Texas Children's Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine. The developers have waived intellectual property rights for the vaccine, which uses traditional recombinant technology that allows for large-scale production and a widely accessible supply [see ProMED COVID-19 update (06): Corbevax, omicron, B.1.640.2, lockdowns, WHO, global 20220106.8700679].

More global headlines
---------------------
- Italy, among the countries in Europe reporting record daily cases, has made COVID-19 vaccination mandatory for those older than 50.
- In China, 2 more cities in Henan province, where the city of Yuzhou is on lockdown, imposed COVID restrictions. They include Xuchang and Gushi. Meanwhile, international flights at the airport in Xian, located in Shaanxi province, have been temporarily suspended as part of efforts to tamp down an ongoing outbreak.
- The global total is closing in on 300 million cases, with the total today reaching 299 323 841 cases, along with 5 470 391 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins online dashboard.

[5] Pandemic plan
Date: Thu 6 Jan 2022

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/01/experts-call-biden-administration-change-pandemic-plan


Today [6 Jan 2022], notable members of the Biden administration's COVID-19 pandemic transition team called on the president to shift his approach to the virus, accepting that it will be endemic and that new variants could emerge and arguing that the country needs a new strategy for living with the virus 2 years after it was first identified in Wuhan, China.

In one of 3 articles published today [6 Jan 2022] in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Ezekiel Emanuel, MD, PhD, of the University of Pennsylvania; Michael Osterholm, PhD, MPH, who directs the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP), publisher of CIDRAP News; and Celine Gounder, MD, of New York University, argue that a new normal must be based on understanding COVID-19 as a respiratory illness, similar to influenza or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Doing so would help the country develop an appropriate risk threshold that would establish peak weekly deaths, hospitalizations, and community prevalence of viral respiratory illnesses during high-severity years.

"This risk threshold triggers policy recommendations for emergency implementation of mitigation and other measures. In addition, health systems could rely on this threshold for planning on the bed and workforce capacity they need normally, and when to institute surge measures," the authors write (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2787944).

In an interview with CIDRAP News, Osterholm said members of the Biden transition team were having these discussions before the omicron (B.1.1.529) variant emerged. The federal government has been acting in emergency mode, they said, and needs to start thinking of the pandemic with long-term goals in mind.

"What's the end game? With the variants, we are never sure what the end game is going to be," Osterholm said in the interview. "This is not a critique of the current administration, as much as an opportunity to plan."

In the same article, experts tout the important of accurate, free, and reliable at-home testing. Widespread access to N95 or KN95 respirators is also argued for, as is better air filtration systems in schools and congregate buildings. Vaccine mandates are also touted, with the authors noting that a 90% vaccine coverage will not be reached without mandates, including mandates for schoolchildren.

Currently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) COVID Data Tracker shows that 62.3% of Americans are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, 73.9% have received at least one dose of vaccine, and 34.9% of fully vaccinated Americans have received a booster shot (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total).

New record of kids hospitalized for COVID-19
--------------------------------------------
At least 4000 US children are currently hospitalized for COVID-19 infections, the highest number of the pandemic, according to the Washington Post. On Christmas [25 Dec 2021], that number was half of that, at 2000.

The spike reflects the overall surge of virus activity due to the omicron variant. The country reported 643 660 new COVID-19 cases yesterday [5 Jan 2022] and 1986 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/cumulative-cases).

As more and more Americans get sick, many with mild or asymptomatic cases, the president of the American Medical Association said in a statement yesterday [5 Jan 2022] that the CDC's new recommendations on isolation and quarantine are confusing and risk further spread of the virus (https://www.ama-assn.org/press-center/press-releases/ama-cdc-quarantine-and-isolation-guidance-confusing-counterproductive).

"A negative test should be required for ending isolation after one tests positive for COVID-19. Reemerging without knowing one's status unnecessarily risks further transmission of the virus," said Gerald Harmon, MD. The CDC has said a negative test is not needed to end post-infection isolation.

Other US developments
---------------------
- Chicago school leaders canceled classes for a 2nd straight day after failing to reach an agreement with the teachers union over remote learning, the Associated Press reports (https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-education-chicago-teaching-4ce377443ef2345ed759049f868a1c77).
- The Transportation Security Administration reported 3037 current COVID-19 infections on Wednesday [5 Jan 2022], a 16% increase over the last 2 days, according to ABC News (https://abcnews.go.com/Health/live-updates/coronavirus/?id=82048523#82105855).
- The Grammy Awards, scheduled for 31 Jan 2022, have been postponed due to the surge in cases driven by the omicron variant, CBS News reports (https://www.cbsnews.com/news/grammy-awards-2022-postponed/).

[It was reported 6 Jan 2022 in The Washington Post that the White House and US Postal Service are finalizing plans to ship coronavirus test kits to US households as soon as next week:
"The White House is finalizing details with the US Postal Service to deliver 500 million coronavirus test kits to households across the country, according to 4 people familiar with the plans, kick-starting a key part of President Biden's response to the raging omicron variant" (https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/01/06/biden-covid-tests-usps/). This is an important move, long overdue, as people are unable to get test kits from commercial enterprises. - Mod.LK]

[In the past 24 hours, 27 countries, including the USA (758 930), France (261 481), Italy (219 430), the UK (179 731), Spain (137 180), India (117 100), Argentina (109 608), Australia (82 314), Turkey (68 413), Germany (56 787), Brazil (44 218), Canada (43 132), Portugal (39 074), Switzerland (32 144), Belgium (27 282), Mexico (25 821), Netherlands (24 575), Denmark (23 968), Ireland (23 817), Colombia (23 039), Peru (19 861), Israel (19 418), Philippines (17 172), Viet Nam (17 017), Poland (16 577), Russia (15 316), and Bolivia (10 263), reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 7866 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 4 Jan 2022 to late 5 Jan 2022).

The exponential rise in cases over the last couple of weeks can be attributed to the rapid increase in the omicron variant cases in over 90 countries. Studies suggest that omicron variant causes milder disease than the previously dominant delta variant, but the high number of cases caused by this highly infectious/transmissible variant could rapidly overwhelm hospitals and health systems. The 7-day averages indicate an increasing global trend on cases with some reduction in deaths.

A total of 74 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 42 of the 74 countries are from the European region, 8 are from the Americas region, 5 are from the Western Pacific region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 3 from the South-East Asia region, and 10 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 66.8%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 4.3%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 99.1% increase in daily reported cases and a 10.5% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily report counted over 2.59 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 300.85 million cumulative reported cases and over 5.49 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
