Malawians have been warned to look out for maize lethal necrosis [MLN] disease that has been attacking maize in other neighboring countries.

Johnny Masangwa, Department of Agricultural Research, said, "We are conducting MLN survey in every district and found that the disease was not yet in. We are carrying awareness messages as a preventative measure to contain its spread this year [2017]." In case of an incursion of MLN, there will be a quarantine of that area and lessons to farmers on how to limit its spread.

[Maize lethal necrosis (MLN) is caused by co-infection of _Maize chlorotic mottle virus_ (MCMV, genus _Machlomovirus_, transmitted by chrysomelid beetles) with one of several species in the family _Potyviridae_. As synergistic partners of MCMV in MLN, _Wheat streak mosaic virus_ (WSMV, genus _Tritimovirus_) or _Maize dwarf mosaic virus_ (MDMV, genus _Potyvirus_) have been reported previously from the Americas and Europe. MLN as well as MCMV were reported for the 1st time in Africa from Kenya in 2012 (ProMED-mail post 20130123.1510727). The disease is spreading in the region where millets have also been identified as an additional crop host being affected by MLN (ProMED-mail post 20150820.3590521). _Sugarcane mosaic virus_ (SCMV) has been reported as the co-infecting virus in Sub-Saharan Africa, but MDMV and SCMV belong to a complex of closely related potyviruses infecting tropical grasses. Based on serology, some strains (for example, MDMV-B) varying in host range and ability to be seed transmitted have been reassigned between the species which has resulted in some confusion in taxonomy.

Symptoms of the individual viruses are synergistically enhanced in MLN and may include leaf mottling and necrosis, distortion of ears, absence of kernels, failure to produce tassels, as well as stunting, premature aging, and death of plants. Symptoms may disappear during the growing season leaving plants with latent infections but reduced yield and as virus reservoirs, making disease monitoring difficult. While MCMV is not seed transmitted, the synergistic partner viruses WSMV and MDMV (including some reassigned strains previously included in SCMV) are. Thus, losses from MLN are both due to yield reductions and trade implications resulting from the risk of virus infected seed. Infectious vector insects may be carried by wind over long distances. Disease management may include crop rotation, certified clean seeds, control of vector species and weedy reservoir hosts, as well as use of crop cultivars or hybrids with reduced sensitivity to the viruses.

The perceived high risk of a MLN incursion in Malawi, as reported above, is entirely justified since the disease has been reported from immediate neighbours Mozambique (ProMED-mail post 20131004.1983210) and Tanzania (ProMED-mail post 20130403.1620327). While it is being reported that surveys have not detected the disease in the country as yet, it is not stated which survey methods were used. If surveys were only conducted from symptoms and/or without molecular diagnosis on samples, MLN may well be present already in Malawi but has remained undetected.
