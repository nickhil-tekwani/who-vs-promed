ANTHRAX, HUMAN, BOVINE - RUSSIA (03): (KRASNODAR)

According to a Rosselkhoznadzor [Federal Service for Veterinary and
Phytosanitary Surveillance] report, the source of the recent anthrax
outbreak in a Krasnodar farm presumably was the transferred soil from
a former animal burial site; specifically, some soil was transferred
to cover the pasture area of the farm, probably from a contaminated
livestock grave site.

The Rosselkhoznadzor had previously reported an anthrax outbreak on
the farm "Uspensakya," where from 10-27 Sep 2010, 154 cows and 60
calves got sick; since then, there have been no new cases. On 20 Sep
2010, 19 cows were culled, and 3 other cows died. 5 people are
currently in the regional hospital with suspected anthrax. All
patients are employees of the affected farm. An outbreak investigation
team is still working on the place to prevent new cases.

[In spite of efforts by our ProMED-Rus colleagues, there is poor
clarification on this. Frankly, it reads more as speculation than hard
data backed by laboratory confirmed positive soil samples. But
according to Nilufar Rakmanova, there was a report on 30 Oct 2010
(<http://eco.rian.ru/danger/20101001/281053010.html>) that an old
animal grave may have been opened by accident. Old graveyards are not
currently identified in any Russian map or marked by stakes or markers
on the ground.

The mayor of the city is now asking city authorities to identify and
mark any existing sites to make sure that neither people nor livestock
have access to them. In the Soviet days, all cattle graves were
routinely checked at frequent intervals for some 5-7+ years. It was
this sampling that revealed that over time, the recovered organisms
(spores) would not uncommonly be losing plasmids to eventually become
apathogenic.

Contaminated cattle-grave disturbance is one of the most common
reasons for livestock anthrax reappearing in a "free" area after a
significant number of disease-free years. The complicating fact is
that very few graves are in fact contaminated; if they were, there
would not be a country where livestock anthrax vaccination would not
be a compulsory annual event. If you want to find one, look for a site
in a pasture with alkaline soil where there is a small sunken area,
say 2-3 meters square that collects rainfall. This is best done after
rain when the now obvious water can be seen -- they are hard to see in
dry weather. Confirmation is by laboratory isolation from one or more
of the "grave" soil samples.
