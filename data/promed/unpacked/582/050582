[In a Previous ProMED-mail post: Casual contact with an infected person
will not spread the disease, Hartmann said. There never has been a
documented case of human-to-human transmission of rabies, except during
corneal transplants.
Here's a citation of Dr Wolfgang Kleitmann (NEJM, vol. 339, no. 2, p. 112
in the section of Case records of the Massachusetts General Hospital):
"The transmission of rabies from person to person is very rare indeed.
...Body fluids, especially saliva, tears and sputum contain the virus...
There is an anecdotal report of human-to-human transmission rabies
transmission. The mother of Marcello Malpighi, the 17th-century
microscopist, was reportedly bitten by her rabid daughter and died of the
disease. Among the 8600 people in contact with patients with rabies at the
Pasteur Institute in Paris in the 1930s, however, rabies developed in only
one. (Warrell DA. Rabies in man. In: Kaplan C ed. Rabies: the facts.
Oxford, England: Oxford Univ Press, 1977:35-6)"

[There is also a report by Fekadu M., Endeshaw T., Alemu W., Bogale Y.,
Teshager T. and Olson JG. Possible human-to-human transmission of rabies in
Ethiopia. Ethiopian Medical Journal 34(2):123-127 (1996) in which a 41 year
old woman and a 5 year old boy may have acquired the illness from family
members who died of rabies. -Man. Ed. DS
