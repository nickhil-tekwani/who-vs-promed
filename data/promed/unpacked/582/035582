Oswego County horse put down after contracting EEE
--------------------------------------------------
A 2-year-old gelding in Oswego County is the state's 1st confirmed
equine case this year [2010] of eastern equine encephalitis, also
known as EEE. The horse has been euthanized.

The infected horse was purchased at a New York auction earlier this
year. The young horse had an unknown vaccination history at the time
of purchase and was not vaccinated after purchase, said state
Agriculture and Markets Commissioner Patrick Hooker.

Last week [16-20 Aug 2010], the gelding showed typical signs of EEE,
including loss of appetite, circling and leaning against the stall.
After examination by a private veterinarian, the horse was
euthanized. Brain samples were sent to the state Department of
Health's Wadsworth Laboratory and tested positive for EEE. To date,
the other horses on the same premises are not showing any signs of
EEE and have since been vaccinated.

EEE is a rare viral disease of horses and humans that is spread by
infected mosquitoes. So far, there have been no reported nor
confirmed human cases of EEE in 2010.

"New York's abundant water sources and humid climate unfortunately
make the perfect breeding ground for mosquitoes and the EEE virus,"
Hooker said. "Therefore, we highly encourage horse owners to protect
their animals and consider vaccinating for EEE. The EEE vaccine has
proven to drastically reduce the incidence of the virus in horses and
can be easily administered by a private veterinarian."

Hooker said humans cannot become infected by handling an infected
horse, nor can a horse acquire the virus from another infected horse;
however, the presence of an infected horse in the area indicates that
mosquitoes carrying EEE are present and infected mosquitoes pose a
threat to both humans and horses.

While there is no treatment or cure for this disease, vaccines are
available and found to be effective in protecting horses from this virus.

News Briefs: Eastern equine encephalitis cases confirmed
--------------------------------------------------------
The Michigan Department of Community Health confirmed a case of
eastern equine encephalitis in a horse and a deer Thursday [26 Aug
2010] in Livingston County, Michigan.

Officials with the health department and the U.S. Department of
Agriculture continue to receive reports of cases of EEE in horses in
southwestern Michigan, including Barry, Calhoun, Cass, Kalamazoo and
St. Joseph counties. Also, cases of human EEE and West Nile virus
have been reported in Michigan.

The Livingston County Department of Public Health is advising its
residents that the best way to prevent mosquito-borne disease is by
reducing exposure to mosquitoes.

[Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) is an infectious, often fatal
disease of horses, humans, and pigs. Wild ruminants (white-tailed
deer) can also become infected. EEE is caused by an RNA virus in the
family Togaviridae and is mosquito-borne (arbovirus). Infection can
cause abnormal neurological behavior and encephalitis in the affected
animal. Most arboviruses that infect wild mammals are not known to
cause disease in their host. The virus is maintained in temperate
areas by wild bird reservoirs and mosquito vectors.

Clinical signs in infected white-tailed deer (and horses) may include
central nervous system disorders after a 1-3 week incubation period.
Affected animals may lose awareness of their surroundings, walk in
circles, exhibit muscle paralysis, stupor, lethargy, and incoordination.

No gross lesions are generally seen in EEE affected
animals. Histopathological (microscopic) examination reveals lesions
consistent with a viral caused meningoencephalitis or encephalitis.

EEE is a zoonotic disease that can infect humans, horses, and deer.
The disease appears to have a minimal impact on wild deer populations
as it has only been reported in multiple animals in North America
once (Michigan in 2005). EEE is not likely to be a major mortality
factor in deer but it is possible that it could impact a local population.

Because EEE can be transmitted to humans by mosquitoes, people should
take the necessary precautions to avoid exposure to these insects. In
humans there is a case fatality rate of 30 to 70 percent and EEE
often causes severe permanent neurological disorders among survivors.

Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) was diagnosed in a free-ranging,
adult, male white-tailed deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_) from Houston
County, Georgia, USA, in July 2001. The yearling buck had neurologic
disease and died during transport to our diagnostic facility. Eastern
equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) was isolated in Vero cell culture
and identified by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction; as
well, EEEV antigen was detected in brain by immunohistochemistry.

This is the 1st report of fatal EEEV infection in a white-tailed
deer. Antibodies to EEEV were demonstrated by microtiter
neutralization in 14 of 99 (14 percent) of the white-tailed deer from
Georgia sampled in fall 2001. Most antibody-positive deer originated
from the Coastal Plain physiographic region. Eastern equine
encephalitis virus should be considered a possible cause of
neurologic disease in white-tailed deer where it may occur. Journal
of Wildlife Diseases, 41(1), 2005, pp. 241-245
