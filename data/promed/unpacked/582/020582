A cow showing symptoms of BSE was found on a farm in the department of
Creuse, region Limousin (France). The whole herd will be slaughtered in the
forthcoming days Slaughtering of the whole herd in which a single case of
BSE has been detected is a standard sanitation measure in France.
This is the first time BSE is reported in the Limousine race. Limousine meat
is highly appreciated by consumers due to its top organo-leptic quality.
Until now, meat was expected not to be contaminated by BSE because several
farms in the producing area use traditional breeding methods.

[Limousine cattle in France are supposed to be fed grass and cereals for
*nice meat production*. This does not include MBM (meat and bone meal).
Furthermore, apparently in 1996, there was one case in Limousines in Cotes
d'Armor. - Mod.TG]

France reported 2 new cases of mad cow disease (BSE, Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy) on Monday, bringing the number of cattle in the country
found with the illness to 31 since the beginning of 1999.
The farm ministry said in a statement the new cases of BSE involved dairy
cows in the western Ile-et-Vilaine and the central Creuse regions.
The 2 infected animals and their respective herds of 157 and 184 cattle were
destroyed, the ministry said. It said the 2 diseased cows, born in France
in October 1995 and March 1994, were most likely infected by consuming feed
not destined for cattle.
