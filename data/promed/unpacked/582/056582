CEFAS (Centre for Environmental Fisheries Aquacultural Science) confirmed last week [week of 29 Jul 2019] that Osprey Lake at the centre of its Kippax Park complex [Leeds, England] had fallen to koi herpes virus - KHV.

The deadly viral disease can cause a 100 per cent wipeout of all carp stocks and has no known cure, often said to be aquaculture's equivalent of foot and mouth disease. As a carp killer it has no equal.

After a separate outbreak on the site's sister Lapwing Lake last year [2018], CEFAS has extended the site's designation order in an attempt to limit the disease. All existing rules apply with restrictions to the movement of fish and aquatic animals.

It is accepted that restocking can be the major cause of transferring the virus with anglers' tackle also to blame, as the pathogen can be carried on the mucus left on nets and other wet equipment from one fishery to the other.

With the virus able to lie dormant for years and host carriers showing no ill effects, I think a lot more fisheries actually carry the virus than anyone can imagine and it is only when all the stress-related conditions come together that an outbreak occurs.

Recent laboratory tests have proved that the virus does not survive on nets that are dried out thoroughly and UV light is better than any secret medication.

Virkon disinfectant net dips are also high on the list of prevention methods with dipping on the way out an important part of protecting other fisheries from a cross-contamination.

[Koi herpesvirus disease (KHD) has been reported throughout the world. The disease is transmitted by fish to fish contact and it is also possible that the disease can spread through contaminated water, nets, and other equipment. As other herpesvirus, KHD has the capacity to remain latent in the infected fish and become activated and cause disease when some stressors trigger it. - Mod.PMB
