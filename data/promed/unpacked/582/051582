MENINGITIS -- BURKINA FASO
==========================
The Burkina Faso state epidemiology survey service has, according to news
services, issued a statement saying that 722 people have died from
meningitis in the last two months. Total reported cases are 8,252. The
country's director of preventive medicine, it is reported, said that the
epidemic is continuing even though 1.3 million people have been vaccinated
and despite public information campaigns. A new vaccination effort has
begun, using 200,000 doses on hand and 400,000 doses now in transit..
This report brings the number of reported deaths from meningitis in West
Africa to almost 3500 -- 722 in Burkina Faso, over 200 in Niger and 2,550 in
northern Nigeria.
