Viral hepatitis spread through oro-faecal route (hepatitis A and hepatitis
E) is completely different from that spread through other routes, i.e.,
sexual, vertical, transfusion, and other parenteral routes (hepatitis B,
hepatitis C, hepatitis D). The public health implications of the two sets
of diseases are different: the former commonly causes outbreaks but no
chronicity, and the latter may lead to chronicity but usually causes no
outbreaks. The management and interventions for the two sets of diseases
are accordingly very different.
So why is vaccination against hepatitis B being carried out in this
outbreak in Kiribati? Even if this outbreak is due to hepatitis B (which
is highly unlikely, and which is a very serious matter if it is true),
vaccination against hepatitis B will not help because protective
sero-conversion takes time.

[This is what I was inferring in my one comment "Can we assume that
hepatitis B vaccination is being carried out because the schools' drinking
water "looks okay"? - Mod. CHC". What we need are data regarding
identification of the infecting virus. Does anyone have such data? If
not, string cut. - Mod.CHC
