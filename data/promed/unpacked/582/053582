I am curious as to why the NAT is reported to take 48 to 72 hours to
complete. Given today's technology, PCR (even RT-PCR needed for RNA
viruses) can be completed in less than 3 hours. Granted detection of the
PCR product can take up to 12 hours if done by traditional southern
blotting methods but by using a liquid ELISA type detection method this can
be cut to between 3 and 4 hours. This would leave more than 12 hours for
DNA/RNA isolation from the blood and still produce test results within 24
hours of receiving the blood. Am I missing something?.

I have a concern regarding the implementation of NAT testing (nucleic acid
testing) on blood donors from the United States. While I whole-heartedly
support any testing that narrows the window period between infection and
seroconversion, I disagree with the decision to implement NAT testing with
the intention of releasing the blood products prior to the results being
completed. The Red Cross has declared the implementation a "research
study" and has filed for an Investigational New Drug application with the
FDA to conduct this testing. Hospitals are being "...encouraged to include
a statement that addresses the issue of NAT testing in its transfusion
informed consent process". Although the current estimated rates of
NAT-reactive donations is projected to be low, the possibility certainly
exists of a patient receiving blood products for which he/she will then be
told within a few days that the unit has tested positive for HCV or HIV-1.
If I were a lawyer, I would have a field day with this. If I were a
patient, I would never be able to understand how the hospital had been
allowed to give me a blood product before they had gotten all the test
results back. Platelets only have a 5 day expiration date and perhaps an
exception will have to be made in this case, but I propose that we DO NOT
transfuse any of the other blood components until the NAT results are back
and found to be negative.

We are struggling with the issues of physician and patient counselling it a
NAT is positive after use of a blood product has occurred. Would
appreciate any thoughts others might have on policy development.
