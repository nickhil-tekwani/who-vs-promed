A suspected cholera outbreak has killed at least 4 people in northern
Kenya, a region badly hit by flooding, say officials. The outbreak,
believed to have been caused by villagers drinking contaminated
water, hit the Ijara area, near the region's provincial capital,
Garissa, some 300 km east of the capital, Nairobi.
Red Cross officials said the deaths brought the toll to 118 people
killed by flood-related incidents across the country since unusually
heavy seasonal rains began pounding the country in late Oct 2006.
Special programmes minister John Munyes said: "We have received
reports that 4 people have died in the Ijara district." He said the
deaths were suspected to have been caused by cholera.

The number of cholera cases has increased since the 1st case was
reported 3 months ago. Kampala, which is the most strongly hit by the
epidemic, has registered 553 patients from 463. The death toll rose
to 8 on Fri morning, 15 Dec 2006, after a child was reported dead at
the Mulago cholera treatment center.
Winnie Bukenya, a senior midwife at the center, said the epidemic was
due to the poor sanitation in the slums. She said the number of
admissions have been higher than discharges.
"The slum dwellers build next to trenches and once their latrines are
full, they are unblocked into the trenches meant to transport rain
water. This causes the spread of the bacteria," Bukenya said.
A statement from the Ministry of Health identified the worst hit
areas as Bwaise, Kalerwe, Nsoba, Mulago, Katwe, Mengo, Kisenyi,
Namuwongo, Luzira and Katanga, all city suburbs. It is said the most
affected areas are located close to the wetlands. The statement said
the heavy rains and increased movement during Christmas season are
likely to worsen the current Cholera situation.
Cholera cases have continued to be reported in the districts of
Kitgum, Pader, Kasese, Bundibugyo, Hoima, Arua, Yumbe and Koboko.

Health authorities in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania's commercial capital,
have started distributing chlorine to purify water in wells, in a bid
to control cholera, which continues to wreak havoc in the city.
"The chemical has been distributed to all 3 municipalities of Dar es
Salaam and should be applied in wells 3 times a day," Deogratius
Mutasiwa, the Dar es Salaam City Medical Officer, told IRIN.
He said chlorine had no side effects; it was also being used to
purify piped water. Mutasiwa said health centers in the city had
continued to record new cholera cases although the rate had declined
significantly, with a daily average of 17 since the beginning of Dec
2006.
"Compared to the past, there is some improvement," he said. "In Oct
2006, we had an average of 50 cases a day."
Dar es Salaam Regional Commissioner Abbas Kandoro said from 12 Dec
2005 to 20 Nov 2006, 11 227 people had contracted cholera in the
