A manatee _Trichechus manatus_ was also found dead in French Guiana on
March 10, 1996. It was a 3.10m long adult male. When I examined the
animal, more than one day after death, it had already been opened by an
unknown individual and it was impossible to conduct an autopsy (body was
full of mud and already in an advanced state of decomposition and parts of
the organs had been removed). The animal had no external lesion but just
nasal serosanguineous discharge which I believe is also observed in death
due to red tide algae toxins. According to witnesses, the animal had this
discharge the day before prior to death.
I could not take any sample except tissue for genetic studies. Manatees
are rarely observed in French Guiana and [thechances to observe a second
casethere are probably poor. However, if this happens, what are the best
samples to collect for a red tide outbreak diagnosis?
