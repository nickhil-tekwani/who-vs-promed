Microbiologists at the Health Protection Agency's Centre for
Infections (CFI) in Colindale have confirmed the link between
contaminated bean sprouts and 141 cases of _Salmonella [enterica_
serotype] Bareilly in the UK. Specialists in the CFI's Salmonella
Reference Unit report that the strain isolated from a bean sprout
sample is indistinguishable from the strain of _S._ Bareilly isolated
from human samples.

Bean sprouts had already featured strongly in a case control study in
which people who had suffered from _S._ Bareilly infection and
controls (people who did not become ill) were questioned about what
they had eaten prior to the onset of illness. However, both the HPA
and the Food Standards Agency (FSA) stress that bean sprouts are safe
to eat provided that they are washed and cooked until piping hot
before consumption or are clearly labelled as ready-to-eat.

Professor Qutub Syed, a director with the HPA's Local and Regional
Services Division, is chairing an outbreak control team comprising
representatives from the Agency, the FSA, Health Protection Scotland,
and Environmental Health Officers from a number of local authorities.

[The number of cases in this outbreak has increased since last posted

the outbreak strain isolated from human cases. - Mod.LL]
