Chikungunya cases are on rise in Sirsi, Siddapur, Yellapur, and Mundgod
taluks. [A taluk is an administrative subdivision of a district. - Mod.TY]
Most of the hospitals in Sirsi town are flooded with chikungunya patients.
The doctors said that the places are having many cases of chikungunya and
viral fever.

According to sources, in Yellapur taluk, out of 11 306 patients tested, 176
are suffering from chikungunya and one has dengue fever, most of the
patients take treatments at private hospitals, said medical officer Dr GN
Ashok Kumar.

Chikungunya or viral fever cases have been reported from most of the
villages in the Mundgod taluk. Many patients are even unable to visit
hospital due to weakness.

Lack of rain is the reason attributed to the increase of chikungunya,
dengue, and viral fevers. These diseases are hindering the farm activities
in all these taluks.

[If there are only 176 confirmed chikungunya virus infections of the 11 306
patients tested, on wonders what the etiology of the other 11 136 cases
might be. Again, as in previous recent posts from Karnataka, "viral fever"
is mentioned, without indicating what pathogen is causing it (see
ProMED-mail archive no. 20090621.2282). The report also indicated that
there was one confirmed dengue case, so presumably some or all of the
non-chikungunya cases were tested for dengue virus infection as well.
