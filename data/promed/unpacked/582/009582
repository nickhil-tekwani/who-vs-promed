Unexpected pattern of influenza spread in South America and tropics
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Researchers studying influenza transmission
patterns in the southern hemisphere and in
tropical areas, specifically Brazil, uncovered
the unexpected finding that each season influenza
travels from low populated regions near the
equator to the more populated centers. Their
work, funded by the Fogarty International Center
(FIC), part of the National Institutes of Health
(NIH), can improve planning for influenza control in tropical areas.
In their paper, "Seasonality of Influenza in
Brazil: A Traveling Wave from the Amazon to the
Subtropics," to be published in the American
Journal of Epidemiology, the researchers document
the seasonal spread of influenza viruses and
seasonal mortality patterns associated with
influenza across Brazil. The interest in Brazil
arises because the country covers a range of
latitudes and crosses several regions, including
tropical and sub-tropical climates.
"This study contributes to the understanding of
the role of tropical regions in the global
circulation of influenza. It has direct
implications for public health by offering
guidance for the timing of delivery and
composition of influenza vaccines," said Dr. Mark
Miller, a co-author and Associate Director for Research at FIC.
As epidemic months of influenza in Brazil are
triggered earlier in the year in the equatorial
regions, vaccine recommendations using
formulations from the northern hemisphere could
be more appropriate for some countries in the
southern hemisphere near the equator. This point
is becoming increasingly important as more
tropical countries introduce and use substantial quantities of vaccine.
Brazilian investigators worked with colleagues at
FIC and the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases (NIAID) in revealing the
unexpected spatial transmission patterns in the
annual seasonality of influenza across a large
area of the South American continent.
Brazil is nearly the same size as the United
States. However, most of Brazil's territory lies
in the tropical belt. This aspect makes the study
valuable since less is known about the
circulation of influenza viruses at these
latitudes and how epidemics bridge and annually
alternate between both hemispheres following the winter seasons.
Given the range of latitude encompassed by
Brazil, which crosses the equatorial and the
southern tropic lines, and using sophisticated
mathematical analytical tools, the researchers
studied the mortality data of influenza and
pneumonia from 2 decades, together with
laboratory confirmed data from recent years.
Both sets of independent data sources converged
to show that, surprisingly, in Brazil influenza
epidemics do not spread from where the highest
human population densities are found, but rather
from the equator towards more populous regions of
the southeast and south of Brazil.
The study, supported by FIC, results from
collaboration among researchers in different
parts of the world. Study authors are Wladimir J.
Alonso (FIC), Cecile Viboud (FIC), Lone Simonsen
(NIAID), Eduardo W. Hirano (Mechanical
Engineering Department, Universidade Federal de
Santa Catarina, Florianopolis, Brazil), Luciane
Z. Daufenbach (Secretariat of Health
Surveillance, Ministry of Health, Brasï¿½a, Brazil), and Mark A. Miller (FIC).

[Influenza virus is a moving target and use of a
single vaccine during the winter influenza season
in both the northern and southern hemispheres may
not be optimal. Before 1998, each February the
World Health Organization (WHO) made a single
influenza vaccine recommendation for both
hemispheres. Subsequently this procedure was
judged to be sub-optimal, particularly for the
southern hemisphere, and WHO now issues separate
recommendations for both the northern and southern hemispheres (see
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/vaccinerecommendations/en/>.
Currently, WHO recommends that vaccines to be
used in the 2006 season (southern hemisphere
winter) contain the following components:
- an A/New Caledonia/20/99(H1N1)-like virus;
- an A/New York/55/2004;
- and a B/Malaysia/2506/2004-like virus.
Whereas vaccines to be used in the 2006-7 season
(northern hemisphere winter) should contain the following:
- an A/New Caledonia/20/99(H1N1)-like virus;
- an A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2)-like virus;
- a B/Malaysia/2506/2004-like virus.
(Alternately, candidate vaccines may include an
A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2) and an A/Hiroshima/52/2005)
The analysis conducted by the Fogarty
International Center has revealed, surprisingly,
that in Brazil (which spans the hemispheres)
influenza epidemics do not spread from where the
highest human population densities are found, but
rather spread from the sparsely populated
equatorial region towards more populous southern
regions of the country. Consequently a northern
hemisphere vaccine formulation may be more
appropriate in northern regions of Brazil and
other tropical countries. This analysis indicates
that the factors affecting the spread of
influenza virus disease are still poorly understood.- Mod.CP]
