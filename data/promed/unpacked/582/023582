- New York has recorded 15 cases of leptospirosis, and one death, in 2021. The rare disease comes from exposure to rats.
- Three of the people infected were experiencing homelessness.
- To help drive down the city's rat problem, a volunteer group of dog-owners go rat hunting on Friday nights.

Rats have been terrorizing New Yorkers even more than usual this year [2021], teaming up in clan warfare during the food-scarce days of strict Covid lockdowns and harassing sidewalk diners once the city began opening up.

And this year, more New Yorkers have been falling seriously ill from a rare but potentially fatal bacterial disease called leptospirosis, which is spread through exposure to rats, and specifically through contact with rat urine or contaminated water.

Last month [Sep 2021], the city's health department reported 14 cases of leptospirosis -- an unusually high number since just New York has documented a total of 57 cases in the 15 years since 2006 -- and alerted healthcare providers to be on the lookout for symptoms. Of the first 14 cases, 13 people were hospitalized with acute renal and hepatic failure, and one person died as a result of an infection, the alert said [see below]. Last week, there was a 15th case. That person appears to have recovered, the health department told Insider.

The disease is treatable with antibiotics and some people won't experience any symptoms, though 1 in 10 cases progress to severe complications, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Every year, there are roughly 150 cases of leptospirosis nationwide, according to the CDC, with most cases occurring in Puerto Rico and Hawaii.

The last time leptospirosis made news in New York was in 2017, when a cluster in the Bronx landed 3 people in the emergency room -- sparking a wave of media coverage and criticism of the city's rat mitigation efforts. A 46-year-old man who worked in a meat processing facility had been hospitalized for muscle pain and shortness of breath after cutting his hand at work. He eventually developed the first documented case of testicular swelling associated with leptospirosis. The 2 others lived or worked on the same block where the 1st man worked. Of the 3, 2 recovered and 1 person died, the city said at the time.

A few months later, New York issued a veterinary medical alert when dogs started falling ill, some of which were believed to have slurped contaminated water in standing puddles while taking walks during the unusually warm winter. There are about 16 cases of canine leptospirosis a year in New York, according to a surveillance report. Canine cases do not predict where human cases will occur, and while canine to human transmission is possible, no case has ever been documented in New York.

The 15 cases of leptospirosis reported this year [2021] came from all over the city. The city's health department says it can't say for certain what's behind the higher number of cases.

Climate change is a likely driver, since warm, moist environments contribute to higher rates of leptospirosis. "Changes in climate that allow bacteria to persist could contribute to an increase in human cases," a health department spokesperson told Insider this week. The spokesperson said that none of the leptospirosis cases had been traced to the widespread flooding in September [2021] from Hurricane Ida. Similarly, no infections had been linked to Hurricane Sandy in 2012.

Housing insecurity also puts people at greater risk of coming in close contact with rats and contaminated water. Three of the people infected this year [2021] were experiencing homelessness, and all of the local infections recorded in the health department's database since the year 2000 involved a person who was experiencing poverty.

Dr. Robert Glatter, a physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York, said leptospirosis frequently goes undiagnosed because it affects vulnerable populations who often can't access healthcare. "The main issue for practicing physicians in big cities is to know about the disease, and then consider it in patients presenting with certain risk factors such as poverty or homelessness," he said in an email.

Brown rats, sometimes known as Norwegian rats, have been a fixture of New York City since they began arriving on boats from Western Europe in the 1700s. In 2014, statistician Jonathan Auerbach estimated that there were about 2 million rats in New York, which is about a quarter the size of the city's human population. There's no reliable headcount of New York City rats and how many of them carry the disease. Dr. Ian Lipkin, a Columbia University epidemiologist who co-authored a 2014 study on pathogens, including the bacteria that cause leptospirosis, in New York rats, said that the best thing the city can do is invest in rodent control [https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.01933-14?permanently=true].

The city spends millions of dollars a year getting rid of rats. There's even a regular "Rat Academy," which is aimed at turning community members into soldiers in the war on rats. (It will be held virtually this year [2021], starting 21 Oct, and you can register here [https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/services/rats-control-training.page].) But as Joseph Lhota, who was known as the city's "rat czar" in the 1990s, put it once: "Anybody who's in charge of eradicating rats in New York knows exactly what Sisyphus felt like."

Just a few months after the 2017 outbreak in the Bronx, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio demanded "more rat corpses" and announced a $32 million anti-rat plan on top of the city's regular sanitation budget. This included $8.8 million for new trash compactors and another $16.3 million to put down concrete "rat pads" over the dirt, basement floors at the city's public housing units with the worst rat issues.

But then came Covid. While it appears that the widespread closures of restaurants and bars in March of 2020 helped to depress the number of rats scampering through the city, New York's vermin population appears to have more than recovered, says Dr. Robert Corrigan, a New York urban rodentologist who has guided several mayors on their anti-rat initiatives. Rat complaints to New York's 311 hotline dipped down during 2020, the 1st year of the pandemic, and have increased by 20% so far in 2021, for a total of almost 20 000 complaints. That coincided with a $45.6 million sanitation department budget cut, which reduced trash pick up around the city, including a 25% reduction in the areas identified by de Blasio's plan for rat mitigation.

Last week, a resident from Mariana Bracetti Plaza in the East Village -- one of the developments included in de Blasio's anti-rat plan -- posted a video to Instagram that went viral. In it, rats were plundering the pile of trash outside her window so voraciously that it woke her up.

A spokesperson for the New York Housing Authority said that inspectors had responded to the infestation and that no recent leptospirosis infections had been reported at its properties.

Richard Reynolds knows all too well the problem of rats repeatedly returning to a pile of garbage. Reynolds leads a double life: By day, he's an American Kennel Club certified dog show judge. By night, he runs a volunteer group of rat-hunting dog-owners, becoming a version of Batman responding to calls from desperate city residents. He gets complaints from public housing projects "constantly," often to the same trash cans. Most Friday nights, for over thirty years, he makes the trip into New York from his home in New Jersey to lead rat-hunting trips with his terriers. The resulting spectacle is not for the squeamish, as fresh blood streams from the dogs' mouths and maggot-infested rat carcasses are dragged out into the open.

Reynolds says he's never had a dog get sick as long as he's been hunting rats. "You can tell when you see a pile of dead rats if they look sick and dehydrated, they probably have lepto," Reynolds said. "Our dogs walk right past those rats." Like others, Reynolds is well aware that ridding New York City of rats is an uphill battle. "If you have 2 rats today, you'll have 24 000 rats a year from now if there's enough trash for them to eat," he said.

2021 Advisory #35: Increase in Leptospirosis Cases in New York City
----------------------------------------
• Human cases of leptospirosis, while rarely reported in New York City, have been increasing over time
• Fourteen cases of human leptospirosis have been identified in 2021
• Human infection is largely associated with exposure to rats

22 Sep 2021
Dear Colleagues,
Fourteen people diagnosed with leptospirosis have been reported to date in 2021, more than the total number reported to the New York City Health Department in any prior year. Cases have been identified in all boroughs except Staten Island, with no obvious clustering. From the 14 cases, 13 were hospitalized with acute renal and hepatic failure, 2 of whom also had severe pulmonary involvement. One person died as a result of infection. All other hospitalized patients were treated and discharged.

One person acquired their infection while traveling. Among the 13 locally acquired cases, most cases had a clear history or risk factor which exposed them to an environment with a severe rat infestation. Three cases reported homelessness. The Health Department has been conducting inspections and where indicated, working with property owners to conduct rat remediation.

Leptospirosis is a worldwide zoonotic disease caused by the spirochete bacteria of the genus and species _Leptospira interrogans_. Warm, moist environments are associated with higher rates of disease, with cases occurring in both rural and urban settings. Clinically, there is a wide spectrum of illness. Symptoms may include fever, headache, chills, muscle aches, vomiting, diarrhea, cough, conjunctival suffusion, jaundice, and sometimes a rash. The incubation period is usually 5-14 days, with a range of 2-30 days. If not treated, kidney failure, meningitis, liver damage, and respiratory distress can occur. In NYC, most human cases are associated with exposure to rats, or environments where rats live. Infected animals may excrete the bacteria into the environment. Humans can become infected through contact with urine from infected animals, or from water, soil, or food that has been contaminated with the urine of infected animals. The bacteria can enter the body through open wounds or mucous membranes. Drinking contaminated water can also cause infection. Person-to-person transmission is rare.

Between 2006 and 2020 in New York City, 57 cases of leptospirosis were identified by the Health Department, of which 13 were associated with international travel (see graph below). Among the 44 locally acquired cases, a range of 1 to 7 cases was reported each year; the median age was 46 years (range 20 to 80 years). All but 4 of the cases were male (90%). Cases were reported from all 5 NYC boroughs: Brooklyn (9), Bronx (18), Manhattan (10), Queens (4) and Staten Island (3).

Providers are reminded to consider leptospirosis in any patient presenting with compatible illness, especially when there is evidence of acute renal and hepatic failure. Diagnostic testing is available through most commercial laboratories and includes serologic testing, and PCR on blood, urine, and CSF (preferably collected prior to the start of antibiotics). Call the Provider Access Line at (1-866-692-3641) for questions about testing or for assistance with additional diagnostic options including immunohistochemical testing and culture at NYS Wadsworth Center or CDC.

Leptospirosis is treated with antibiotics, such as doxycycline or penicillin, which should be given early in the course of the disease. As per CDC guidance, for patients with mild symptoms, doxycycline is the drug of choice (100 mg orally, twice daily for 7 days), if not contraindicated. Other options include azithromycin (500 mg orally, once daily), ampicillin (500-750 mg orally, every 6 hours), or amoxicillin (500 mg orally, every 6 hours). For patients with severe disease, IV penicillin is the drug of choice (1.5 MU IV, every 6 hours), doxycycline (100 mg IV twice daily), ceftriaxone (1 to 2 g IV once daily), or cefotaxime (1 g IV every six hours). The duration of treatment in severe disease is usually seven days.

Cases can be reported to the health department by logging into Reporting Central via NYCMED, by mail, by faxing to 347-396-2632 the paper Universal Reporting Form, or by calling the Provider Access Line at (1-866-692-3641). If a provider does not already have a NYCMED account, he or she will need to register at the NYCMED link above. Once logged in, Reporting Central can be found in the 'My Applications' section. See the Reporting Central New User Guide (PDF).

As always, we appreciate your continued collaboration with our efforts to identify cases and monitor trends to help inform and direct remediation efforts in New York City.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Mahmoud Orabi for his submission.

Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that is distributed widely throughout the world. Although leptospirosis is more common in tropical areas, it is also found in temperate areas. It is transmitted to humans by direct contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes with the urine of infected animals or by contact with wet soil, vegetation, or fresh (not salty) water that has been contaminated with infected animal urine. These animals are mostly asymptomatic but chronically infected with one of the several hundred serovars of the spirochete _Leptospira interrogans_.

Many species of wild and domestic animals (including rodents, dogs, cattle, and swine are susceptible to chronic urinary infection with _Leptospira_. In carrier animals with chronic renal infections, leptospiruria persists for long periods or for life, and _Leptospira_ bacteria shed in urine may survive in fresh water or moist soil for weeks to months.

Leptospirosis is an occupational hazard for people who work outdoors or with animals; for example, workers in wet agricultural settings (such as rice field workers), ranchers, slaughterhouse workers, trappers, loggers, sewer workers, veterinarians, fishery workers, dairy farmers, or military personnel. Leptospirosis is also a risk from household exposure to infected pet animals or rodents.

Leptospirosis is a risk during recreational activities such as camping, fresh water swimming, canoeing, kayaking, rafting, golfing, and trail biking that involve exposure to water in lakes, rivers, or ponds contaminated by urine from _Leptospira_-infected animals.

Outbreaks frequently follow heavy rainfalls, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers. Inadequate disposal of trash and debris provides a suitable habitat for rat infestation in urban settings.

Although vaccines are available for immunizing other animals against leptospirosis, no vaccine against leptospirosis is available for use in humans.

Leptospirosis initially presents as a non-specific illness with chills, fever, headache, myalgias, and conjunctival suffusion. Patients often have a dry cough, which is usually mild and without any sequelae, that accompanies the other symptoms. Severe leptospirosis, known as Weil's disease, is characterized by liver damage (causing jaundice), renal failure, and bleeding. Meningoencephalitis and myocarditis may also be present.

The news article above reports that 2 of 15 patients in the current outbreak in New York City had severe pulmonary involvement. Pulmonary hemorrhage, can be severe in leptospirosis, with massive hemoptysis, respiratory insufficiency and death (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3519021/, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16148523, and https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/14/3/07-1064_article)

Because of the relatively nonspecific nature of the clinical presentation of leptospirosis, its diagnosis cannot be made confidently without laboratory confirmation (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0242886). The diagnosis of leptospirosis requires confirmation by MAT (microscopic agglutination test) serology, but an IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), IgM dipstick, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have been used to confirm the diagnosis (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3939550/). However, laboratory diagnosis for leptospirosis may not be not widely available at a local level.

Dr. Jan Clement has cautioned (see ProMED post Leptospirosis - Australia (03): (QL) comment 20210525.8380596) that Seoul hantavirus infection, also transmitted by rats, may be misdiagnosed as leptospirosis because its clinical manifestations mimic that of leptospirosis. - Mod.ML
