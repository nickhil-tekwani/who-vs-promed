Tests confirm equine flu in Indian province
-------------------------------------------
The deaths of 4 horses in police stables in Ahmedabad, in India, were
caused by equine influenza, testing has revealed. The testing of
samples from the horses were carried out by the National Research
Centre on Equines (NRCE). The Times of India reports that 12 of 38
horses in the police stables were affected by the disease, which was
last seen in the state in 1988.

The state of Gujarat was yesterday expected to place restrictions on
horse movements in a bid to control the spread of the highly
contagious disease.

India suffered problems with equine influenza in an outbreak last
year [2008]. It said the outbreak had occurred in Jammu and Kashmir,
the country's northernmost state. The report put the date of the 1st
outbreak, in the village of Katra, at 20 Jun 2008 and the 2nd,
centred on the village of Anantnag, as beginning on 7 Jul 2008. Both
villages are close to the Pakistan border. Late last year the country
reported to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) that
nearly 18 000 horses had contracted the disease and 16 had died. The
report said several other districts were affected: Budgam, Pulwama,
Srinagar, Kupwara, Baramula.

severe and widespread epidemic of Indian equine 'flu in 2008. We
promise to do better next time. - Mod.MHJ]
