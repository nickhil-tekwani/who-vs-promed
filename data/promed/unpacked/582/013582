Three more New Mexico mule deer have tested positive for deadly chronic
wasting disease (CWD). State Game and Fish Department officials said today
that all 3 infected deer were from the White Sands Missile Range in
southern New Mexico, the site where the only other state deer to test
positive for the disease was found.
CWD is a neurological disorder transmissible among deer and elk and always
fatal to those animals. So far, only 4 deer have tested positive for the
disease out of 557 New Mexico deer and elk whose tissue has been examined
by a laboratory at Colorado State University in Fort Collins.
But what's surprising is that 4 of the 15 deer samples collected at White
Sands were infected with the disease, a rate of more than 25 per cent. Game
and Fish Department spokesman Marty Frentzel said that in Colorado, the
percentage of diseased deer in an infected area varies from less than 1 per
cent to a range between 3 and 15 per cent. "Of course, the fact that we
have more than 25 per cent at White Sands may just be due to the small
number we've tested there," Frentzel said. Even so, the test results are
not good news for the White Sands deer population.
"With an incubation period between 18 months and 5 years, the prevalence
rate we are detecting at White Sands suggests CWD has been present there
for a number of years," said Kerry Mower, a wildlife disease specialist
with Game and Fish. Larry Bell, director of Game and Fish, conceded there
appears to be a wasting disease problem at White Sands. "But overall, our
testing indicates this disease is not widespread in the state," Bell said.
"We will continue to monitor the situation to the best of our ability."
After the disease was discovered in the first White Sands deer back in June
2002, Bell declared a state animal health emergency and barred the
importation of deer or elk. That ban is still in effect.
Another 59 samples of deer and elk tissue collected in New Mexico remain to
be tested by the Colorado State Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. These
include 7 samples taken by hunters during a January 2003 hunt in the Organ
Mountains adjacent to White Sands Missile Range.
Some hunters have been cooperating with the state by bringing in tissue
samples from the deer and elk they have killed. But the 4 animals that
tested positive were collected by state officials. Of the 3 most recent
deer to test positive, one was tested in December 2002 at White Sands using
a tonsil biopsy technique that permits tissue to be taken without killing
the animal. This deer was killed after it tested positive for the disease.
The other 2 were tested by the more conventional method, in which the
animal is killed and its brain stem removed for examination.
Mower said the state will continue both live and lethal testing and expects
to collect as many as 100 additional samples between now and June 2003.
"Between now and when things start to green up in May, there is so little
nutrition we begin to see sick animals, which we will collect," Mower said.
He said that until sick animals are tested, it is impossible to know
whether they are infected with CWD or suffering from malnutrition or some
other malady. CWD symptoms include weight loss, lethargy, staggering,
excessive salivation, and drinking water more than is normal.
The disease is not known to be contracted by humans, but the state has
advised hunters to use latex gloves while dressing animals and to avoid
eating nervous-system tissue such as brains, spinal cords, lymph nodes and
eyes.
Mower is in Laramie, Wyoming, this week attending a multistate conference
designed to coordinate regulations aimed at controlling the disease. He
said New Mexico is not sure how the disease got to White Sands. Although
the disease was first detected in New Mexico last year, it has been studied
for 3 decades in north eastern Colorado and south western Wyoming. More
recently, it has been found in either wild or captive deer and elk herds in
Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Dakota,
Wisconsin, and in the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan.
