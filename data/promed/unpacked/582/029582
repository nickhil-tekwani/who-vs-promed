The future and sustainability of the cattle dung manure-fed biogas digesters hangs in the balance following widespread deaths of cattle in the Goromonzi district under mysterious circumstances. The community in Ward 4 is still puzzled by the situation, particularly when the responsible ministry for livestock development has failed to provide an explanation.

Cornelius Chataika, the treasurer of the Domboshava Development Community Association (DDCA), said "About 90 percent of the cattle around the ward died due to an unknown airborne disease, and this [has] affected the availability of cow dung to feed the digesters."

"The future and sustainability of the biogas digester projects in this ward and other surrounding areas is now threatened with the deaths of hundreds of cattle in 2017, with experts in the livestock ministry even failing to explain the mysterious disease," he said. "The situation was so severe and what we only observed during this period after the deaths were blisters around the livers of the cattle."

[Domboshava is a village in the province of Mashonaland East, Zimbabwe; see map at https://tinyurl.com/y9dnfobk. The above report addresses mass mortality (hundreds) of cattle in 2017.

Earlier this year, the same newspaper reported the death of more than 2000 cattle in the same province due to tick-borne diseases; see https://www.newsday.co.zw/2018/03/january-disease-kills-2-000-cattle/.

Another newspaper reported recently [26 Jun 2018] that "Zimbabwe has lost at least 3420 cattle to tick-borne diseases between November 2017 and May 2018, with Mashonaland East recording the highest deaths." See
http://www.chronicle.co.zw/zim-loses-3-430-cattle-to-tick-borne-diseases/.

However, the current report relates to a single location where hundreds of cattle reportedly died.

Zimbabwe currently suffers a foot and mouth disease event (20180630.5882506).

The application of the expressions "deaths of cattle under mysterious circumstances," "unknown airborne disease" and "observed after the deaths blisters around the livers" may reflect laymen observations that have undergone media treatment. An update/explanation from professionals, preferably the veterinary authorities, will be helpful. - Mod.AS
