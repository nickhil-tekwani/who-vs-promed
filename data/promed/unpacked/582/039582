An outbreak of _Shigella dysenteriae_ in the Central African Republic (CAR)
----------------------------------------------------
Since week 19 (mid-May 2005), an outbreak of bloody diarrhea has been
reported in the north of CAR (350 km north of Bangui) in villages between
Bossangoa and Bouca (Ouham province). 71 cases and 2 deaths have been
reported as of 3 Jul 2005. 21 stool samples have been collected by Medecins
sans Frontieres-Spain and sent to Pasteur Institute Bangui. _Shigella
dysenteriae_ 1 has been isolated 5 times. _Schistosoma mansoni_ has been
found in 12 samples out of 16, but this parasite is endemic in the country.
The 5 isolates of _S. dysenteriae_ have the same resistance profile and are
susceptible to all cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones. 2 similar outbreaks
have been reported in the 2 adjacent regions the last 2 years.
