The secretary-general of the Federation for Relief and Development Mr Ahmed Al Omari in a press conference held in Beirut [Lebanon] today [21 Oct 2014], titled "Rescue Arsal before it is too late", has appealed to the UN high commissioner for refugees, the United Nations, and international relief agencies for "the immediate return of relief services to refugees in Arsal", pointing to "the existence of a party (unnamed) putting pressure on these organizations in order to prevent them from working and providing humanitarian relief in Arsal under the approval of the town on the work of these organizations without any hindrance".

He pointed to the existence of 67 camps within the borders of Arsal, including 4809 tents, home to 5000 families, in addition to the presence of more than 7000 other families inhabiting houses, rooms, and warehouses in Arsal, describing the town as a "humanitarian catastrophe".

He said that "Mercy Hospital and the field hospital in Arsal are receiving more than 400 cases/day, at a total cost of USD 50 000," calling for declaration of a "health emergency" for the Syrian refugees in the town, after the start of the outbreak of hepatitis, especially among children [number of patients not specified].

He also expressed "fear of deaths of children due to severe cold, in the light of expectations that the coming winter will be a tough season".

[The age range of cases is not stated. If most are adults, it is likely that the illness is type E viral hepatitis being spread by contaminated water. Most individuals in a developing world situation will be immune to type A viral hepatitis, which is also food/waterborne, by the age of 10.

Hepatitis E is found worldwide, and different genotypes of the hepatitis E virus determine differences in epidemiology. For example, genotype 1 is usually seen in developing countries and causes community-level outbreaks, while genotype 3 is usually seen in the developed countries and does not cause outbreaks. Globally, 57 000 deaths and 3.4 million cases of acute hepatitis E are attributable to infection with hepatitis E virus genotypes 1 and 2.

The highest seroprevalence rates (number of persons in a population who test positive for the disease) are observed in regions where low standards of sanitation increase the risk for transmission of the virus. Over 60 per cent of all hepatitis E infections and 65 per cent of all hepatitis E deaths occur in East and South Asia, where seroprevalence rates of 25 per cent are common in some age groups. In Egypt, half the population aged above 5 years is serologically positive for the hepatitis E virus (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs280/en/index.html).

The Beqaa Valley (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beqaa_Valley), also transliterated as Bekaa, Biqa or Becaa, is a fertile valley in east Lebanon. It is Lebanon's most important farming region. The Beqaa is located about 30 km (19 miles) east of Beirut. The valley is situated between Mount Lebanon to the west and Anti-Lebanon Mountains to the east. It forms the northeasternmost extension of the Great Rift Valley, which stretches from Syria to the Red Sea. Beqaa Valley is about 120 km (75 miles) in length and has an average width of about 16 km (9.9 miles). It has a Mediterranean climate of wet, often snowy winters and dry, warm summers. The region receives limited rainfall, particularly in the north, because Mount Lebanon creates a rain shadow that blocks precipitation coming from the sea. - Mod.LL
