Press statement on the suspected yellow fever outbreak in Kayunga District
-------------
The New Vision newspaper of 1 Jul 2003 reported that at least 30 people
were admitted at several health units in Kayunga district with suspected
yellow fever. This information was purported to have been provided by the
District Director of Health Services (DDHS) during a District Council
meeting. The Epidemiological Surveillance Division (ESD) of the Ministry
of Health immediately sent an investigation team to verify the validity of
the newspaper report and to confirm whether there is a yellow fever outbreak.
A team comprising a clinical epidemiologist and 2 specialists in viral
diseases has conducted a quick assessment that has demonstrated that the
newspaper report was not accurate. Firstly, none of the 4 cases (not 30 as
reported) with yellowing of the conjunctiva (jaundice) had any bleeding
tendencies. Secondly, the 1st case with jaundice and fever was identified
on 6 May, the 2nd on 16 May, the 3rd on 9 Jun, and the 4th on the 15 Jun
2003. Yellow fever is a disease of sudden onset with jaundice and fever,
and later in the course of the disease there are bleeding tendencies.
Blood samples were collected from all 4 cases and have been analysed at the
Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) and they are negative for Yellow
Fever. Therefore, based on the case definition for Yellow Fever and the
laboratory tests, the 4 cases observed in Kayunga District are NOT Yellow
Fever.
In view of the fact that all the patients had itching of the skin, a
diagnosis of hepatitis is the most plausible explanation. Furthermore, of
the 4 patients with jaundice identified in Kayunga district (2 admissions,
one outpatient, and one managed in a private clinic), none has died.
There is an ongoing epidemic of Yellow Fever in southern Sudan, but no
cases have been reported in Uganda to date. Therefore, the public is
advised not to panic but to be on HIGH ALERT. Yellow fever is caused by the
yellow fever virus, which remains silent in the body during an incubation
period of 3-6 days. The incubation period is followed by 2 disease phases.
While some infections have no symptoms whatsoever, it is common for
patients in the first "acute" phase to have fever, muscle pain (with
prominent backache), headache, shivers, loss of appetite, nausea, and/or
vomiting. After 3-4 days most patients improve and their symptoms
disappear. However, about 15 percent enter a "toxic phase" within 24 hours.
During the toxic phase, fever reappears and several body systems are
affected. The patient rapidly develops jaundice and complains of abdominal
pain with vomiting. Bleeding can occur from the mouth, nose, eyes, and/or
stomach. Once this happens, blood appears in the vomit and faeces. Kidney
function deteriorates, which could result in complete kidney failure with
no urine production. Half of the patients in the "toxic phase" die within
10-14 days. The remainder recover without significant organ damage.
Infected humans and monkeys are the main transmitters of yellow fever. The
virus is carried from one animal or person to another (horizontal
transmission) by a biting mosquito (the vector). However, the mosquito can
also pass the virus via infected eggs to its offspring (vertical transmission).
Over the years, the Ministry of Health has put in place an alert system for
epidemic-prone diseases and rapid-response teams to respond to suspected
outbreaks.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank our colleagues in the Epidemiologic
Surveillance Division of the Uganda Ministry of Health for a rapid response
to our request for information on the investigation of the outbreak
discussed above. One wonders whether the media were responding to a
"panic" related to information of a yellow fever outbreak in Sudan (a
northern neighbor of Uganda) and the vaccination activities that were being
conducted along the border as a preventative measure. The reported "30
cases" were in fact only 4 cases as described above; were not associated
with hemorrhagic manifestations but rather were cases of mild icteric
illness; there were no fatalities reported; and the laboratory studies
conducted at the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) were negative for
yellow fever. - Mod.MPP]
