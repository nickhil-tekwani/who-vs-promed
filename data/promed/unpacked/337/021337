DUGONG MORTALITY - MALAYSIA: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

While reading The Star newspaper (web site: http://www.thestar.com.my/) for
information about Japanese encephalitis and Hendra-like viruses, I came
across a news item (19 March) about the death of four dugongs ("sea cows")
off the Malaysian coast near Johor Baru (Johor Baharu) near Singapore and
across the Strait of Malacca from Indonesia. Nothing is yet known about
the etiology of these deaths.
The world's dugong (_Dugong dugon_) population has been decreasing for some
years and this mammal is considered threatened in some parts of the world.
Major dugong populations have been reported in Australia, the Persian Gulf
and parts of the Red Sea, the northern and eastern coast of east Africa,
Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and the Pacific Islands. For additional information
about this species see
<http://agrolink.moa.my/moa1/dugongbr/html>
Last July there was a story in an Australian newspaper about a Queensland
government minister who alleged that the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park
Authority had overstated the threat to the Queensland dugong population.
The slow-breeding mammal had been said to have declined in numbers to about
1,700, a reduction of 50% in the past eight years. The GBRMPA denied the
accusation and suggested that gill netting was responsible for almost half
the dugong deaths in Australia. Dugongs are officially protected almost
everywhere they occur but in some places native populations are allowed to
harvest them for food. In other places, such restrictions are ignored by
local peoples.

Dugongs are related to manetees
<http://www.bc.manatee.com/> and
<http://www.savethemanatee.org/>, of which there are three species:
Trichechus manatus_, _T. inunguis_, and _T. senegalensis_. As are dugongs,
manatees also are considered endangered or threatened. Boating accidents
are the cause of most manatee deaths in Florida but dinoflagellates ("red
tides") and assorted other etiologies, including infectious ones, have been
blamed.

Apparently, some experts believe that changed conditions of water
temperature, salinity, and other characteristics may lead to changes in
water clarity, which results in changes in populations of algae and other
resources, perhaps leading to decreased resistance of these endangered
mammals. This could be a world-wide problem consistent with human and
livestock wastes, oil dumping, etc.
The Australian group Capricorn Community Dugong Watch was formed in 1996 in
Teppoon, central Queensland, east of Rockhampton, where a dugong die-off
had been noted.
If anyone has information regarding an infectious etiology for dugong
deaths anywhere, please let me know.
