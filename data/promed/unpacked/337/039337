New virus outbreak kills girl in Korea
--------------------------------------
The nation's 1st fatal case of hand, foot and mouth disease was reported
yesterday [13 May 2009], raising concerns among many parents here. A 12
month old girl died of a brain inflammation on Tuesday last week [5 May
2009] after being infected with enterovirus 71 (EV-71), a strong
[virulent?] intestinal virus, said Jun Byung-yul, a senior official of the
Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Caused by intestinal viruses coxsackie A virus and enterovirus 71, the
human syndrome [hand, foot, and mouth disease] is a common childhood
disease that mainly affects children under the age of 5 during the summer
and early autumn months. Early symptoms of the disease are similar to those
of ordinary flu such as a fever and a sore throat. Even though there is no
specific vaccine for the disease, most patients recover in a week without
medical treatment. However, in severe cases, patients can suffer from
neurological complications such as brain inflammation and meningitis,
sometimes leading to death.

There have been some cases where children infected with the coxsackie A
virus have had complications in Korea. But it is the 1st time for the
enterovirus 71, which has killed more than 80 children in China since last
month [April 2009], to be found in the country.

"Because the girl had never been to China and other South East Asian
countries where the virus has thrived in recent years, we think the virus
has already been localized in this country after being transferred from
China," Jun said. It is possible the virus is [responsible for] some deaths
of children who died of brain inflammation or meningitis [in South Korea]
in recent years, Jun said.

Despite the worsening situation in and out of the country, health
authorities said they do not know the exact number of children infected
with the EV-17 because the disease is not a legally designated infectious
disease monitored by the government. According to recent government
figures, which were offered by 186 sample pediatrics in the latest 19
weeks, the number of patients seems to be increasing. However, the outbreak
is not large enough to be considered an epidemic, health officials said.

"Some fatal cases in China are considered because children in some regions
were malnourished and couldn't be supported by the better medical system,"
Jun said. "We will launch a monitoring system on the outbreak situation of
the disease in cooperation with related medical organization, especially in
Suwon, Gyeonggi Province, where the nation's 1st fatal case was found," he
added.

Experts say intestinal viruses usually thrive in warm weather, causing
hand, foot and mouth disease in April and other complications in May until
the rainy season starts in June. "The disease passes easily among children
through blisters on their hands, feet, and buttocks. So child care centers
and kindergartens need to take greater care in cleaning surfaces of
children's stuff," said Kim Dong-soo, a podiatrist at Severance Children's
Hospital. "There's no special way to prevent the infection. Children and
their parents themselves should follow hygiene rules such as drinking
boiled water only, brushing teeth whenever necessary and avoiding
contacting with too many people," Kim advised.

Meanwhile, the government's [delayed] announcement of the fatal case, which
occurred 10 days earlier, was criticized by the media and the public.
"There was some miscommunication among health officials in reporting the
case to upper authorities. I apologize for confusing people about the
case," said Jun, who is in charge of disease prevention and control
including the latest H1N1 influenza.

[This appears to be the 1st fatal case of hand, foot and mouth disease
among children in South Korea so far this year (2009). It is likely that
the disease is widespread in South Korea and has escaped attention because
fatalities are rare in such outbreaks. It is likely that there will be more
cases since transmission of hand-foot-mouth disease increases in
prevalence, as do all enterovirus infections, with the onset of summer weather.
