Bali rabies death toll tops 124
-------------------------------
The outbreak of rabies that has hit Indonesia's resort island of Bali
since late 2008 has killed 124 people, officials said Thursday [24 Feb
2011].

A 62-year-old man who died on Wednesday [23 Feb 2011] became the
latest victim of the disease, said Ken Wirasandhi, a member of a team
in charge of handling the disease at the main Sanglah hospital. "The
man was in critical condition when he was admitted," he said.

On Sunday [20 Feb 2011], 2 more people died of the disease, according
to a report in the Jakarta Globe newspaper. [The Jakarta Globe of 24
Feb 2011 stated that rabies has claimed 124 lives in the province
since the 1st victim succumbed in 2008 with 10 of the fatalities
having occurred this year. However, Nyoman Sutedja, the head of the
Bali Health Office, was quoted as saying that only 49 of the 124
deaths had been proven categorically to have been caused by rabies
virus infection

The Bali government has embarked on a campaign to vaccinate nearly
400 000 dogs in an effort to eradicate rabies by 2012. Bali health
chief Nyoman Sutedja said a lack of control in the dog trade could
further fuel the spread of the disease. But he said despite the new
deaths, cases of dog bites had fallen from about 200 a day to 130.
"The new cases won't threaten the goal of eradicating rabies by 2012,"
Sutedja said. "The trend is cases are on the decline." Official data
put the number of dogs in Bali at around 450 000, the actual figure
could be a lot higher, officials have said. Balinese are known for
their love of dogs.

Rabies has been reported on the Indonesian islands of Java and
Flores, but Bali was free of the disease for decades until 2008.

The World Health Organization estimated that more than 40 000 people
die from rabies every year. Most deaths occur in developing
countries.

[The precise number of human victims of rabies virus infection on the
Indonesian island of Bali is difficult to establish, but cases are
still occurring and it is clear that the outbreak is far from
contained. In the preceding ProMED-mail post concerning the rabies
outbreak in Bali, Merritt Clifton reviewed the available data and
concluded the overall total of 183 human rabies victims cited in that
report post was plausible, since that Bali media for almost a year now
have often stated the numbers of victims at 20-30 more than the
numbers victims specifically identified, and that if the officially
acknowledged totals of victims from 2008, 2009, and 2010 are combined
the total would be 151.
