Bartonellosis is an ever-amazing infection. For years it has been confined
to the coast valleys to the west of the Andes Mountains in Peru. It has
never found in the Oriental part of these mountains. Some years ago
several reports from local researchers showed the disease in the high
jungle of the departments (States) of Amazonas, Cajamarca and Cuzco
(Quillabamba). The report from Palmira Ventosilla confirms the emergent
condition of the disease.
Carrion's disease has an amazing resemblance to AIDS. The disease has 3
strikingly different stages:
(1) An acute phase (the Oroya fever) is characterized by a generalized
infectious process with extravascular haemolytic anemia, hepato- and
splenomegaly, and fever. Pathophysiologically, _Bartonella bacilliformis_
invades cells of the reticuloendothelial system, and red blood cells (where
they really penetrate within by a process known as "reversed endocytosis").
(2) An intermediate phase, Odriozola's intercalar period, where the patient
recovers and [the disease evolves asymptomatically; and
(3) a eruptive phase, the Peruvian Verruga.
Patients who are at the end of the first stage develops a series of
opportunistic infections resembling those we see in AIDS patients:
diseminated toxoplasmosis (indeed one of the first cases reported as
disseminated toxoplasmosis did ocurr in a patient with Carrion's disease)
and histoplasmosis, _Pneumocystis carinii_ pneumonitis and others. As the
research of Dr. Patrucco shows, at this time patients with Bartonellosis
have a striking decay on their CD4+ lymphocytes, and polyclonal gammapathy.
The last phase ("Verruga Peruana") has a pathophysiology and pathology that
resembles that of AIDS patients with Kaposi sarcoma and bacillary
angiomatosis.
Of course, both diseases (AIDS and Bartonellosis) can be transmitted by
transfusion.
