Hepatitis of unknown origin in children - WHO/Europe and ECDC launch the first joint surveillance bulletin
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Surveillance summary
This report provides an overview of the cases of hepatitis of unknown origin in children aged 16 years and below reported to ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe through The European Surveillance System (TESSy) hosted at ECDC.

- As of 13 May 2022, 232 cases of acute hepatitis of unknown etiology in children aged 16 years or below have been reported -- of which 229 were classified as probable and 3 as epidemiologically linked -- by 14 countries (Belgium (12), Cyprus (2), Denmark (6), Greece (2), Ireland (6), Italy (24), the Netherlands (6), Norway (5), Poland (1), Serbia (1), Slovenia (1), Spain (26), Sweden (9), and the United Kingdom (131)). Of the 229 probable cases, 122 have recovered, while 18 remain under medical care.

- The epicurve shows cases by the date of onset of 1st symptoms of disease. An increase in the number of cases has occurred from week 9. As severe hepatitis can take some time to develop after the onset of the 1st symptoms and as investigations take time, there may be a delay in the reporting of cases. The recent decrease in cases is therefore challenging to interpret.

- The majority (75.9%) of cases are < 5 years of age.

Of 143 cases with information, 22 (15.4%) were admitted to an intensive care unit. Of the 98 cases for which this information was available, 6 (6.1%) have received a liver transplant. There has been one death associated with this disease.

Overall, 151 cases were tested for adenovirus by any specimen type, of which 90 (59.6%) tested positive. The positivity rate was the highest in whole blood specimens (68.9%).

- Of the 173 cases PCR tested for SARS-CoV-2, 20 (11.6%) tested positive. Serology results for SARS-CoV-2 were only available for 19 cases, of which 14 (73.7%) had a positive finding. Of the 56 cases with data on COVID-19 vaccination, 47 (83.9%) were unvaccinated.

Introduction
------------
This report provides an overview of the cases of hepatitis of unknown origin in children aged 16 years and below reported to ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe for the period up to 13 May 2022, through The European Surveillance System (TESSy). Figures and tables describe national case-based data for surveillance of hepatitis of unknown origin in children aged 16 years and below from all the countries and areas of the WHO European Region, including the 27 countries of the European Union (EU) and the additional 3 countries of the European Economic Area (EEA).

Since the 1st alert launched by the UK on 5 Apr 2022, cases of hepatitis of unknown etiology in children have been reported from multiple countries worldwide. It is not yet clear whether all cases identified following the alert are part of a true increase compared to the baseline rate of hepatitis of unknown etiology in children.

The etiology and pathogenetic mechanisms of disease are still under investigation. A possible association with current adenovirus infection has been identified, but other hypotheses and possible co-factors are under investigation. Most cases continue to be reported as sporadic, unrelated cases.

Data are submitted through the case-based record type NOVHEP to The European Surveillance System (TESSy) database hosted at ECDC.

Cases of hepatitis of unknown origin should be reported to TESSy if they meet any of the following criteria:

Case Definition
---------------
Probable: A person presenting with an acute hepatitis (non-hepatitis viruses A, B, C, D and E*) with aspartate transaminase (AST) or alanine transaminase (ALT) over 500 IU/L, who is 16 years old or younger, since 1 Oct 2021.

Epi-linked: A person presenting with an acute hepatitis (non-hepatitis viruses A, B, C, D and E*) of any age who is a close contact of a probable case since 1 Oct 2021.

Discarded: A subject previously classified as a case, that following further investigations did not meet the case definition criteria.

*Cases of hepatitis with known etiology such those due to specific infectious diseases, drug toxicity, metabolic, hereditary, or autoimmune disorders should not be reported under this protocol.

Note that the UK local case definition includes only cases younger than 16 years which means cases aged 16 years are unlikely to be reported to TESSy from the UK.

Epicurve
--------
[Although there are a handful of cases reported with a date of onset of illness in late 2021, the curve began to spike upward at epidemiological week 9 of 2022 (6 cases/week) peaking at week 15 (44 cases) and then dropping sharply. As noted in the summary, "As severe hepatitis can take some time to develop after the onset of the 1st symptoms and as investigations take time, there may be a delay in the reporting of cases. The recent decrease in cases is therefore challenging to interpret." - Mod.LL]

Thirteen more cases of mysterious hepatitis in UK
--------------------------------------------------
Thirteen more children in the UK have been found to have sudden onset hepatitis, as a child in Ireland died from the severe liver condition.

Health officials around the world are investigating a sudden rise in cases of the condition in children. The WHO said 348 probable cases of the acute form of hepatitis in children had been detected in more than 20 countries since it started monitoring the situation early in April [2022]. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control put the global case total at 450 by [3 May 2022].

In the UK, the country which first raised the alarm of a rise in cases, the UK Health Security (UKHSA) recorded 176 child cases as of [10 May 2022], mostly in children under 5. Of the ill children, 128 lived in England, 26 in Scotland, 12 in Wales and 9 in Northern Ireland.

Eleven of the UK children needed liver transplants but none died. A child in Ireland died after being admitted to hospital as another received a liver transplant, Irish health officials said. Ireland has recorded 6 cases of hepatitis in children up to the age of 12 since April [2022].

The outbreak of cases surprised health officials the world over and a global investigation has yet to determine precisely what is causing the uptick in cases. The common viruses that cause hepatitis: hepatitis viruses A, B, C, and E; have not been detected in any of the cases reported worldwide. The WHO said the most likely cause is adenovirus, a common cause of childhood illness, though other viruses including [the one that causes] COVID-19 are being investigated. Adenovirus is the most frequently detected virus in samples tested by the UKHSA. In a briefing on [6 May 2022], the UKHSA said adenovirus was detected in 91 cases out of the 126 that had been tested. Testing of 7 children in England that needed a liver transplant found all 7 had adenovirus.

First 4 cases of acute childhood hepatitis confirmed in Mexico
--------------------------------------------------------------
The 1st 4 cases of acute childhood hepatitis in Mexico have been detected in the state of Nuevo León, as reported on Thursday [12 May 2022], by the state Health Secretariat. The patients are stable and remain under continuous medical surveillance to monitor their progress. "We have received the report of 4 patients in different public and private institutions. So far, all stable. They are children of different ages," said the head of the unit, Ana Rosa Marroquín Escamilla, at a press conference.

The official has not given more details of the state of health of the minors, but has assured that they are being carefully watched. "We are monitoring them and later we will be able to share the most accurate information," she mentioned. Marroquín has pointed out that it is not yet known what causes this disease, which has already resulted in many probable cases around the world. "There are different theories and in a percentage of cases, slightly less than 30% [higher in some studies - Mod.LL], a respiratory virus has been isolated in parallel, which is called adenovirus 41," she explained [adenovirus 41 is typically associated with gastroenteritis and more rarely respiratory symptoms. - Mod.JH] "We still do not have the certainty that this is the agent that is causing the inflammation of the liver," she pointed out.

Although the cause of the acute childhood hepatitis cases is unknown, they are mainly being reported in children under 16 years of age, the official highlighted. "That is why it is very important that we are attentive to any sign or symptom that may lead us to suspect that a child may develop hepatitis," she indicated. "Children with hepatitis develop, associated with diarrhea and vomiting, abdominal pain and a yellowish coloration both in the skin and in the mucous membranes. The conjunctiva of the eyes looks a little yellow and the skin also looks yellow," she described.

The WHO has warned on [2 May 2022] that the increase in cases of acute childhood hepatitis of unknown origin is a "very urgent" issue. According to the international organization, the disease has spread in 20 countries and possible infections are being investigated in another 13, after the 1st 10 cases were reported in the UK on [5 Apr 2022].

Three children in Greece diagnosed with acute hepatitis
-------------------------------------------------------
The Greek National Heath Organization (EODY) announced on Thursday [12 May 2022] that 3 children had been diagnosed with acute hepatitis in Greece. The EODY announced that after conducting a thorough investigation, they found 3 children who fit into the WHO's criteria as likely cases of acute hepatitis.

Out of the 3 children, 2 experienced stomach pain and vomiting, and the 3rd was asymptomatic, but the hepatitis was found during routine testing. All 3 children are healthy and in good condition.

Greek health authorities have been on high alert since late April [2022] following a mysterious spike in cases of acute hepatitis in children around Europe. Cases of the illness that causes liver inflammation in children have been recorded across the world, including in North America, Asia, and Europe.

Researchers have found that 2 illnesses -- adenovirus and COVID-19 -- have a strong link to cases of acute hepatitis but are not present in all cases, as the 3 children in Greece all tested negative for the diseases. Additionally, the children, much like in other cases, tested negative for the 5 hepatitis viruses: hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E.

Parents are advised to look out for jaundice, or the yellowing of eyes and skin, dark urine, and pale stool in their children, as they are all indicators of hepatitis.

[These 3 cases were seemingly milder and 1 was asymptomatic. It is unclear why that child was even tested. It is said in the post that all 3 tested negative for adenovirus and SARS-CoV-2 but the adenovirus PCR positivity may depend on whether whole blood or plasma is used and it is not stated if the SARS-CoV-2 testing was PCR, antigen or antibody testing. The report of an asymptomatic case, if it winds up being a documented case of whatever is or are causing this entity, could suggest there are many more subclinical cases in children and perhaps adults. - Mod.LL]

Citation: Nishiura H, Jung S-M, Hayashi K: High population burden of omicron variant (B.1.1.529) is associated with the emergence of severe hepatitis of unknown etiology in children. Int J Infect Dis. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2022.05.028
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Objectives: In industrialized countries that have experienced major extensive epidemics of omicron (B.1.1.529), substantial fraction of the population was exposed including children.

Methods: Statistical association between the detection of at least one hepatitis case among children and the cumulative number of omicron cases (B.1.1.529) was examined. A total of 38 countries that belong to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and Romania were included in the analysis.

Results: Of the total of 39 countries, 12 detected at least one hepatitis case, and their confirmatory diagnoses of omicron cases from 1 Dec 2021 to 27 Apr 2022 ranged from 4.4 to 11.9 million. Among the remaining 27 countries, the cumulative number ranged from 0.5 to 5.5 million cases. Countries with hepatitis cases experienced a higher population burden of omicron cases (p = 0.013).

Conclusions: Prior exposure to omicron variant may be associated with an increased risk of severe hepatitis among children, indicating a critical need to conduct cofactor studies.

[In item 5, while there was a correlation with reported absolute numbers of COVID-19 cases and the appearance of this as yet undefined pediatric hepatitis when the authors looked at COVID-19 cases per 100 000 population, the differences were not signficant: "Comparing the cumulative incidence of omicron cases per capita between 2 groups, 12 countries with at least 1 hepatitis case again yielded greater mean incidence (21 868 per 100 000) than the other 27 countries (18 532 per 100 000), but the difference was not significant (t = 0.866, p = 0.40)."

The joint ECDC-WHO report is the 1st to clearly show an epi-curve plotting 1st day of symptoms of cases over time and seems to show a prominent rise in cases starting at epidemiological week 9 (starting 25 Feb 2022) and peaking at week 15 (starting 8 Apr 2022) with a subsequent drop. Most of the cases, therefore, are not from looking back to months ago. The drop, as they note, may relate to a delay in reporting. The report also provides, to some degree, data on SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing and reported 14 of 19 being positive. This could lead to some more support to the theory that, in the absence of adenovirus DNA in the liver specimens tested, SARS-CoV-2 ought to be responsible for the hepatitis as a late phenomenon which is akin to what may be the case with MIS-C. The numbers are small and there is no parallel data on SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in control children without this hepatitis.

The Nishiura paper mentioned in a previous post is now in press as a Short Communication in IJID, and could be interpreted as supporting a role of SARS-CoV-2 in the undefined hepatitis reports but the data was seemingly only statistically significant with reported absolute cases of COVID-19 in countries, not cases per 100 000 population. Even if there were a strong statistical association with past infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the development of severe hepatitis in children (again there did not seem to be a control group in the ECDC-WHO data), this could be a "post hoc ergo propter hoc" scenario, that is "if it happened after, it must be due to" which is proven as faulty reasoning many times for attributing cause and effect. The COVID-19 vaccines are not implicated as most children were young enough not to be eligible for immunization.

The adenovirus data presented in the joint ECDC/WHO report certainly expands the information with 73 of 106 samples using whole blood adenovirus PCRs being found positive (68%). Previous metagenomic data from the UKHSA did not show any adenovirus DNA in the liver specimens. This might suggest the hypothesis that adenovirus (primarily serotype 41) could be, in conjunction with another trigger in the immune system (recent SARS-CoV-2 infection perhaps), at work. The finding of adeno-associated virus 2 in the UK in liver tissue using metagenomics remains unclear as previously discussed.

To date, minimal peer-reviewed studies on this growing outbreak have been published. ProMED awaits more information including blood and liver metagenomics, CDC data comparable with WHO/ECDC/UKHSA, more evidence for past COVID-19 infection, and screening of asymptomatic household contacts for elevated aminotransferases. Survey data from 12 May 2022 in Eurosurveillance suggested a signal for increased undefined pediatric hepatitis in certain countries but not all in Europe and Asia but no parallel data seems to have been published from the USA. Importantly, the epicurve published today (13 May 2022) by ECDC-WHO certainly shows a peak in numbers using the day of onset of symptoms beginning in late February 2022 so most of the newly reported cases were not from earlier in the time span being looked at. - Mod.LL]
