The [Massachusetts] state's Division of Marine Fisheries [DMF] has banned shellfishing in the west side of Buzzards Bay and in Mount Hope Bay because of a breakout of toxic algae late last week [week of 3 Oct 2016].

The ban affects all [Massachusetts] South Coast towns and cities. "As a result of the closure, digging, harvesting, collecting, and/or attempting to dig, harvest or collect shellfish, and the possession of shellfish, is prohibited in Bourne, Dartmouth, Fairhaven, Falmouth, Gosnold, Marion, Mattapoisett, New Bedford, Swansea, and Westport," the state said in a press release.

The trouble concerns a toxic kind of phytoplankton termed pseudo-nitzschia. These algae can produce domoic acid, a biotoxin that concentrates in filter-feeding shellfish.

High concentrations of domoic acid can cause amnesic shellfish poisoning, with symptoms including vomiting, cramps, diarrhea, and incapacitating headaches, followed by confusion, disorientation, permanent loss of short-term memory, and in severe cases, seizures and coma, the announcement of the ban stated.

Rhode Island also appears to be affected, said the state. Concentrations of the algae in Buzzards Bay are said to be "extremely high," said the announcement.

Based on the results of further testing, DMF will reopen areas once the phytoplankton bloom has dissipated and shellfish are known to be free of toxic levels of domoic acid.

"The closure will not affect the harvest of whelks, bay scallops, or sea scallops for purposes of extracting and selling or consuming the adductor muscle," said the Marine Fisheries division.

[_Pseudo-nitzschia_ species are a marine phytoplankton capable of producing domoic acid, but not all members of the genus produce domoic acid. At the present time only a handful of pseudo-nitzschia produce the toxin.

Bait fish, such as anchovies and sardines, may feed on these blooms and subsequently transfer the domoic acid to their predators which include seabirds and marine mammals. The toxin has a deleterious effect on these animals, often resulting in their deaths. Interestingly, the species of _Pseudo-nitzschia_ capable of producing domoic acid do not do so all the time. The conditions that trigger toxin production are of great interest to researchers.

In addition to not harvesting and consuming certain shellfish from the area, the communities should be aware that allowing pets into the water could be harmful. Although it is getting cool in some area, signs should be posted indicating no swimming and to caution pet owners about allowing pets to swim in the water or consume the water, if they are so inclined.
