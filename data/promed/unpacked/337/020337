Nevada's eighth case of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome has been diagnosed in
rural Elko County, the state Health Division reported Thursday.
Investigators for the division had yet to interview the 36-year-old male,
who is recovering from the disease, to find out how he may have contracted
the infection.
It is the first confirmed case of hantavirus in Nevada in more than 2 1/2
years. Of the eight cases in Nevada, two have resulted in death.
