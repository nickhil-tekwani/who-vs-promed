New species of Ebola virus discovered
-------------------------------------
Scientists report the discovery of a new species of Ebola virus,
provisionally named Bundibugyo ebolavirus, 21 Nov [2008] in the
open-access journal PLoS Pathogens. The virus, which was responsible
for a hemorrhagic fever outbreak in western Uganda in 2007, has been
characterized by a team of researchers from the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, the Uganda Virus Research
Institute; the Uganda Ministry of Health; and Columbia University.

Ebola virus infection in humans causes severe disease for which there
is presently no vaccine or other treatment. Case fatalities range
historically between 53 and 90 percent. Therefore, research efforts
into the Ebola virus genus and potential diagnostics are ongoing,
with the discovery of Bundibugyo ebolavirus representing one of the
latest pieces added to this puzzle.

The new virus is genetically distinct from all other known Ebola
virus species, differing by more than 30 percent at the genetic
level. More traditional ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay)-based assays detected the new virus; however, the unique
nature of this virus created initial challenges for traditional Ebola
virus molecular diagnostic assays and genome sequencing approaches.

To determine the genetic signature of this new Ebola virus species,
scientists used a recently developed random-primed pyrosequencing
approach, quickly determining the genetic sequence of over 70 percent
of the virus genome.

Knowledge of this sequence then allowed for the rapid development of
a sensitive molecular detection assay, which was deployed to the
field as part of the outbreak response. This draft sequence also
allowed for easy completion of the whole genome sequence using a
traditional primer walking approach and prompt confirmation that this
virus represented a new Ebola virus species. Current worldwide
efforts to design effective diagnostics, antivirals, and vaccines
will need to take into account the distinct nature of this new member
of the Ebola virus genus.

entitled "Newly Discovered Ebola Virus Associated with Hemorrhagic
Fever Outbreak in Uganda" by JS Towner and 17 others published in

Abstract
--------
"Over the past 30 years, Zaire and Sudan ebolaviruses have been
responsible for large hemorrhagic fever (HF) outbreaks with case
fatalities ranging from 53 percent to 90 percent, while a 3rd
species, Cote d'Ivoire ebolavirus, caused a single non-fatal HF case.
In November 2007, HF cases were reported in Bundibugyo District,
Western Uganda. Laboratory investigation of the initial 29
suspect-case blood specimens by classic methods (antigen capture, IgM
and IgG ELISA) and a recently developed random-primed pyrosequencing
approach quickly identified this to be an Ebola HF outbreak
associated with a newly discovered ebolavirus species (Bundibugyo
ebolavirus) distantly related to the Cote d'Ivoire ebolavirus found
in western Africa. Due to the sequence divergence of this new virus
relative to all previously recognized ebolaviruses, these findings
have important implications for design of future diagnostic assays to
monitor Ebola HF disease in humans and animals, and ongoing efforts
to develop effective antivirals and vaccines."

Authors' summary
----------------
"In this report we describe a newly discovered ebolavirus species
which caused a large hemorrhagic fever outbreak in western Uganda.
The virus is genetically distinct, differing by more than 30 percent
at the genome level from all other known ebolavirus species. The
unique nature of this virus created challenges for traditional
filovirus molecular based diagnostic assays and genome sequencing
approaches. Instead, we quickly determined over 70 percent of the
virus genome using a recently developed random-primed pyrosequencing
approach that allowed the rapid development of a molecular detection
assay that was deployed in the disease outbreak response. This draft
sequence allowed easy completion of the whole genome sequence using a
traditional primer walking approach and prompt confirmation that this
virus represented a new ebolavirus species. Current efforts to design
effective diagnostics, antivirals and vaccines will need to take into
account the distinct nature of this important new member of the
filovirus family."

According to the 8th Report of the International Committee on Virus
Taxonomy (ICTV), virus species in the genus _Ebolavirus_ of the
family _Filoviridae_ may be distinguished on the basis of
glycoprotein gene sequence difference (more than 30 percent amino
acid difference), cross protection data (where available) and
differences in geographic origins.
