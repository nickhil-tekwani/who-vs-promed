Red blister, a fungal disease; has attacked several coffee plantations in Bukomansimbi district [Central region]. Joseph Mulindwa, National Agricultural Coffee Research Institute, reveals that the disease has become widespread in the area which has caused farmers losses. The disease destroys the embryonic part of the coffee cherries, making them to ripen before they are due and eventually affecting the quality and weight on harvest.

Mulindwa advises farmers to boost their soil fertility such that the coffee plantations are well saturated with nutrients that supports them [to] develop some resistance against the disease. [Farmers are] calling upon the Ministry of Agriculture to directly support them with pesticides required to fight off the problem.

The red coffee blister is an addition to other coffee diseases that include the infamous coffee wilt disease and the coffee twig borer [_Xylosandrus compactus_] that have for years been stressing factors to coffee farmers and producers in many parts of the county.

[Cercospora berry blotch, also called red blister, of coffee is caused by the fungus _Mycosphaerella coffeicola_ (previously _Cercospora coffeicola_). The fungus can also cause leaf spot (brown eye spot). Fruit symptoms include raised spots on green or ripe berries resembling sunburn or scars and may join to form red blisters; this makes berries difficult to pulp and may reduce the green bean quality. Leaf symptoms consist of expanding brown leafspots with an eye-like appearance which may lead to defoliation and loss of plant vigour. Stress factors, such as lack of fertilisers, may predispose plants to infection. Cercospora infection may facilitate secondary invasion of the host by other fungi.

Disease development is favoured by high humidity, rain, warm temperature, and drought stress after flowering. Exposed, unshaded trees, and nursery seedlings are most susceptible. The fungus is spread mainly by infected plant material, such as crop debris. Disease management usually requires an integrated approach, including phytosanitary methods and cultural practices, but serious outbreaks may require copper fungicides.

Leaf spot diseases on a range of crops (such as peanut, soybean, sugar beet, maize) can be caused by other fungi previously classified as _Cercospora_ species. While some of them have since been attributed to different genera, the diseases are often still referred to as cercospora leaf or eye spots.

Coffee wilt disease (CWD, also called tracheomycosis), also mentioned above, is caused by the fungus _Gibberella xylarioides_ and affects only robusta coffee (_Coffea canephora_). It was previously reported in Uganda (see ProMED-mail posts 20090514.1807 and 20080731.2346).
