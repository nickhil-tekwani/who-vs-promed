During the last week [8-14 Aug 2008], the Director of Public Health
has been notified of 17 cases of measles in Gibraltar. Most of the
cases seen so far
have been in children under 18 years old and predominantly in children
who had not been vaccinated with the MMR [measles, mumps and rubella]
vaccine. Children who have not contracted disease naturally and those
who are unvaccinated are now at great risk.

Measles is a very unpleasant disease, although nowadays quite rare.
Most people will have a mild attack with fever and rash, but it
should be remembered that the disease is capable of causing some very
serious consequences. Complications such as fits or even bacterial
infection and pneumonia can develop. Adults as well as children can
get the disease, but it tends to affect small children more often.
However, many adults will have caught the disease as a child and will
therefore be immune.

Measles is [preventable] with the MMR vaccine, which is available
free on Gibraltar's health service. The vaccine was first introduced
in 1989, but, unfortunately, it encountered adverse publicity in the
UK in the late 1990s, causing some parents not to immunise their
children. These fears have subsequently been disproved by several
large international studies, the results of which are widely
published on NHS [National Health Service] websites and elsewhere.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) calls the MMR vaccine "a highly
effective vaccine with an outstanding safety record." Fortunately, in
Gibraltar, the uptake of vaccine has generally been good.

The Gibraltar Health Authority is urging all parents of children who
have not had the MMR vaccine to get their children immunised as soon
as possible. This course will consist of 2 injections approximately 3
months apart. Arrangements are also being made to offer vaccine to
younger children at earlier ages than usual when it is felt that the
child may be exposed to greater risk of catching the disease.
Children can be immunised as early as 6 months.

For further information, please contact the child welfare department
at the Primary Care Centre (tel: 72945) or your doctor. Public
information is also available on the UK website:

[The Rock of Gibraltar is located at the entrance of the Mediterranean
Sea. Gibraltar is connected by a sandy isthmus to Spain, by ferry to
Morocco and by flights to London. No information has been provided
regarding the source of the measles virus responsible for this
outbreak. In this respect, it will be relevant to determine the
genotype of the measles virus involved.

According to a survey during the period 2005-2006 (see: "High genetic
diversity of measles virus, World Health Organization European
Region, 2005-2006." By J.R. Krem et al., Emerg Infect Dis. 2008
Jan;14(1):107-14
<http://www.cdc.gov/eid/content/14/1/107.htm>),
9 measles virus genotypes were identified throughout the World Health
Organization European Region. All major epidemics were associated
with genotypes D4, D6, and B3. Other genotypes (B2, D5, D8, D9, G2,
and H1) were only found in limited numbers of cases after importation
from other continents. The genetic diversity of endemic D6 strains
was low; genotypes C2 and D7, circulating in Europe until recently,
were no longer identified. The transmission chains of several
indigenous measles virus strains may thus have been interrupted by
enhanced vaccination. However, multiple importations from Africa and
Asia and virus introduction into highly mobile and unvaccinated
communities caused a massive spread of D4 and B3 strains throughout
much of the region. Thus, despite the reduction of endemic measles
virus circulation, importation of measles virus from other continents
caused prolonged circulation and large outbreaks after their
introduction into unvaccinated and highly mobile communities. These
observations provide evidence for the endemic circulation of genotype
D6 in Europe, at least during the past 15 years. Measles cases in the
European Region associated with other genotypes were mostly due to
virus importation from other continents. Determination of the
genotype of the current Gibraltar outbreak strain will help clarify
its origin.

A map of the distribution of measles virus genotypes up to 2006 can
be found in the WHO Weekly Epidemiological Record, No. 51/52, 2006,
81, 469-48
