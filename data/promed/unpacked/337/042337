In regard to: ProMED-mail posting Undiagnosed deaths, giant squid - USA
(CA) RFI, 20050202.0353:
I'd bet my next paycheck (as huge as that is) that the jumbo squid in
southern California are eating something toxic and that this leads to
neurological impairment and aberrant behavior, i.e. swimming onto the
beach. I put forward domoic acid (DA) as one candidate -- just as in 2002.
1.) DA causes deranged behavior (convulsions, even death) in marine mammals
that feed on the same things that squid do.
2.) It is produced in harmful algal blooms in relevant upwelling areas off
the coast of California.
3.) It is found in organisms that are sometimes (but not always) eaten by
squid (anchovies, sardines, krill, pelagic crabs).
4.) It affects the squid nervous system in lab experiments, and squid have
receptors for the toxin that are very similar to mammalian ones. These
receptors are found in nerve cells all over the nervous system and normally
respond to the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate.
In addition, I suspect that there is an environmental wild card that
augments the effects of DA (or any other toxin) -- most likely thermal
stress to the squid from spending too much time chasing food and eating in
relatively warm surface water. Our electronic tagging work to date shows
that this species normally spends very little time right at the
surface. Of course, environmental effects (temperature, sunlight,
salinity, pollution, etc.) could also affect the production of toxin by the
phytoplankton -- this is a really interesting thing. In the case of DA,
blooms of the species of diatom that produce it are only sometimes toxic.
No one knows why.
I also think it is likely that there are many other toxic compounds that
are produced in phytoplankton blooms. We only know about DA because it
killed people who ate poisoned mussels and therefore merited investigation.
In humans it produces amnesic shellfish poisoning. The same thing can be
said about saxitoxin (SA), the principle agent responsible for paralytic
shellfish poisoning. If there were toxins that were highly specific to
squid (and relatively ineffective against mammals), it would probably be a
long time until someone cared enough to fund the research to figure it out.
Presently we are collecting stomachs or stomach contents from beached squid
in southern California in order to identify exactly what organisms they
were eating and to assay this material for SA. Unfortunately, my lab is
neither funded nor equipped to do such chemical analysis, so that means
arranging collaborations with other scientists who are also under-funded
and over-extended. An obvious candidate to analyze the beached squid is CA
Department of Fish and Game.

A friend was out on a sport boat fishing for squid the other day. When
cleaning the squid he found numerous large yellow spots and was afraid to
eat the squid. These were 25-pound types caught off San Diego. Don't know
if this is relevant.
