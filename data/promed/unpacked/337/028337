[Sheep pox and goat pox are OIE-listed serious viral diseases of sheep and goats, found in parts of Africa and Asia, the Middle East, and most of the Indian subcontinent. Parts of China are known to be endemically infected.

The diseases are characterised by fever, generalised papules or nodules, internal lesions (particularly in the lungs), and death. Both diseases are caused by strains of capripoxvirus which can infect sheep and goats but the clinical manifestations in the 2 animal species can differ significantly: there are virus strains which clinically affect sheep only, others may affect sheep and goats similarly, and there are capripox virus strains which affect only goats.

According to the interactive map included in the source URL, 2 outbreaks have been recorded in the southern part of Russia's Chitinskaya oblast, in Asia, which borders on its south Mongolia as well as China's Inner Mongolia. The Russian notification refers to 2 outbreaks, one involving a sheep flock including 603 animals (38 cases), the other one composed of sheep and goats (2153 animals, 74 cases). It may be assumed that the outbreak relates to sheep pox, but the notification does not specify if goats, in the mixed flock, have been affected as well. Clarification is requested.

The diagnosis of sheep pox and of goat pox is generally based upon clinical observations. When laboratory confirmation is required, the methods applied are electron microscopy, virus isolation, antigen detection, histology, and animal inoculations. The Russian report on the application of "optical microscopy" is in need of clarification. Does this refer to EM?.

The same capripox virus vaccines (predominantly, live-attenuated) may be used to protect small ruminants against sheep pox and goat pox as well as cattle against its capripox virus, namely lumpy skin disease (which has, so far, been restricted to Africa and the Middle East). - Mod.AS
