Possible outbreak of botulism in birds in Laguna Navaseca (Ciudad
Real) Castilla-La Mancha, Spain
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operatives of the Agriculture and Environment (Ministry) of
Castilla-La Mancha have collected specimens of dead birds in Lake
Navaseca, located a few kilometers from the National Park of Las
Tablas de Daimiel (Ciudad Real). Lake Navaseca collects treated water
from the Daimiel Wastewater station and has become in recent years,
in the absence of water in the National Park of Las Tablas de
Navaseca, an alternative habitat for birds.

According to various sources consulted by Efe (The Spanish National
News Agency), the death of these birds could have been caused by an
outbreak of avian botulism by ingestion of a toxin produced by the
bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_. That is a form of food poisoning
that causes birds to develop a neural paralysis which inhibits the
body's muscular response.

Birds affected by this toxin usually have symptoms such as paralysis
which causes an inability to fly, dive, walk or keep their neck
straight, and which (in turn) causes death by drowning, if they are
in the water, or respiratory arrest.

The appearance of the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_ is more
likely during the summer months, when temperature conditions or the
status of the water allow for bacterial development. However, the
sources have reported that so far it can not be said "categorically"
that the death of the birds is related to the bacteria that causes
botulism, as laboratory analysis is still being conducted to
determine the actual (cause of) death of these specimens.

Dead birds are being buried to prevent other birds becoming infected
by the putrefaction of corpses and the emergence of larvae or worms
which can be ingested by other birds. Furthermore, technicians are
collecting affected birds in order to transfer them to the Wildlife
Recovery Center "El Chaparrillo" where veterinarians are working to
rehabilitate these bird better.

Among the affected birds are examples of colored duck (_Netta
Rufina_), shoveler (_Anas clypeata_), Shelduck (_Tadorna Tadorna_)
and Gadwall (_Anas strepera_).

Outbreaks of botulism are often common in wetlands of the Biosphere
Reserve of La Mancha, where there have been some important
(outbreaks) in the last 15 years. Previous outbreaks were recorded in
2008 (Lake Navaseca) and in 2002 (Laguna de la Vega del Pueblo, Pedro
Munoz, Lakes Alcazar de San Juan and Malagon). The largest outbreak
occurred in 1999 in the National Park Las Tablas de Naveseca,
affecting more than 10 000 birds.

Navaseca Lake has become an important ornithological site welcoming
more than 80 species of birds, such as red duck, spoon duck or the
Gadwall, many of whom are utilising the area to breed.

[Botulism is an intoxication caused by ingesting _Clostridium
botulinum_ exotoxin or by absorbing toxin produced in the alimentary
tract (toxico-infection). The causative toxin in birds is mainly of type C.

The zoonotic potential of type C botulism is minimal, even
negligible. Only 4 poorly documented type C botulism intoxications
have been reported in people, but cases have occurred in nonhuman primates.

Botulism is not an OIE-listed disease, but may be included in annual
reports voluntarily. Final results of the laboratory investigations
in Spain will help. In case botulism is confirmed, information on the
identity of the causative toxin in the outbreak will be appreciated. - Mod.AS]
