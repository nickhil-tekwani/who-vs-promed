In a follow-up on the listeriosis outbreak in South Africa, the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) puts the number of laboratory-confirmed cases at 602 nationally as of 13 Dec 2017, including 40 deaths.

Six out of 10 cases have been reported from Gauteng Province, while Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal accounted for an additional 20 percent of cases.

The Minister of Health convened a multisectoral meeting on 14 Dec 2017 with representatives from the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery (DAFF), NDoH and NICD at which NICD presented data contained in this Situation Report. A multisectoral outbreak response plan is being compiled.

Over 15 in-depth food histories have been taken from case-patients in Gauteng Province. A number of foodstuffs have been identified that are common to all affected persons.

Environmental health practitioners have been requested to visit homes of persons newly diagnosed with listeriosis and sample available food where possible.

Consumption of food contaminated with _Listeria monocytogenes_ can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, there are serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within 2 months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

[When last reported by ProMED-mail, there were, as of 29 Nov 2017, a total of 557 laboratory-confirmed listeriosis cases, with most cases being reported from Gauteng Province (62%). Now there are 602 nationally as of 13 Dec 2017, including 40 deaths.

The prior ProMED-mail post said that whole genome sequencing, performed on 189 _Listeria monocytogenes_ clinical isolates, found that 71% (134/189) belong to a single sequence type (ST6) and identified a clonal cluster within sequence type (ST) 6, which suggested that most cases in this outbreak have been exposed to a common source. Some food items are said to have been identified that are common to affected persons from a small number of "in-depth" food histories, but investigations are ongoing. - Mod.ML
