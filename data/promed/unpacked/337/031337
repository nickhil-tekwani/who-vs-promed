Dubai: Mystery illness could be herpes encephalitis
-----------------------------------------------
Health authorities are investigating the death of a 2-year-old boy
who died 2 days after he was admitted for high fever, unconsciousness
and bleeding from the nose. The toddler died on Tue 31 Oct 2006 after
he was admitted to Al Qasimi Hospital on Sun [29 Oct 2006], according
to his distressed father, who was later admitted to hospital along
with his 8-year old daughter with similar symptoms.
Dr. Ali Shakar, undersecretary at the Health Ministry, told Gulf News
that the father and sister were recovering from their illness. "The
father and [sister] are stable, and their fever has reduced. We are
going to discharge them soon, after 48 hours of observation," he
said, adding that the hospital was taking appropriate precautions to
prevent transmission.
He also said that ministry officials suspected that the boy died of
herpes encephalitis, a viral infection characterized by high fever,
seizures and depressed level of consciousness. He added that the
Ministry could not confirm the diagnosis until they received the
results of blood tests sent to laboratories in Germany and the UK,
expected today [Sun 5 Nov 2006].
He said the infectious disease specialists on the case have so far
ruled out mosquito-borne illnesses. "I can 100 percent say that it is
not hemorrhagic fever, dengue or Japanese encephalitis," he said,
explaining that mosquitoes that carried these diseases were not found
in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). He said health officials did not
know how the family became infected, as they had not traveled or had
any contact with animals recently. They also reportedly did not have
any food poisoning history. He also said that there were no reports
of similar cases at other hospitals. The boy's father told Gulf News
from hospital that the family had gone to their hometown of Homs, in
Syria, during the summer, returning 2 months ago.
Herpes encephalitis is caused by the herpes simplex virus type 1 [now
designated Human herpesvirus 1 by the International Committee on
Taxonomy of Viruses (the ICTV) - Mod.CP]. It can affect any age
group, but is most common in people under the age of 20 and above the
age of 40. The mode of transmission is usually through exposure to
infected saliva or respiratory secretions, which travel along the
nose into the limbic lobe. Symptoms include fever and headache for
several days, followed by behavioral changes, seizures, partial
paralysis and unconsciousness. Not all cases exhibit these symptoms.

[Human herpesvirus 1 predominantly infects mucosal epithelium and is
associated with lesions of oral, nasal and genital epithelia.
Exposure to infection occurs early in life. The virus penetrates
sensory nerve endings during primary infection and is transported to
the neural cell bodies which comprise the trigeminal ganglion where a
latent infection is established, occasionally reactivating causing
peripheral epithelial lesions. Latent infection is established early
in the life of most individuals.
Rarely, human herpesvirus 1 invades the central nervous system,
producing herpes encephalitis, a cytolytic infection of neurones
predominantly in the temporal lobes. Untreated herpes encephalitis
has a mortality of more than 70 percent, and survivors may be
neurologically damaged. All age groups are susceptible, but the
frequency of occurrence of herpes encephalitis is low (perhaps one
case per million population). Symptoms generally begin with fever and
headache, rapidly followed by disorientation and loss of
consciousness. In recent years, however, acyclovir therapy has
greatly reduced morbidity and mortality.
The results of laboratory diagnosis of the young child in Dubai are
awaited with interest. The clinicians' diagnosis could be accurate. - Mod.CP]
[If there is laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis of herpes
encephalitis in the young child, it would be very unusual to see a
cluster of 3 cases in the same family. Given that, other diagnoses
to explain the cluster of 3 cases of a febrile illness associated
with epistaxis (bleeding from the nose) should be investigated. More
information from knowledgeable sources in Dubai would be very much
appreciated. Mods.DK/MPP]
