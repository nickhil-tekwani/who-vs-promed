2002/170 _Monilinia fructicola_ found in Austria
The NPPO of Austria has recently informed the EPPO Secretariat that
_Monilinia fructicola_ (Mf) was found in Austria for the first time
during monitoring conducted in the framework of EU surveys. 3 peach
trees tested positive for Mf in 2 nurseries in the adjacent regions
Niederosterreich and Wien.
It is not known how Mf was introduced into Austria. Monitoring will
continue in 2003. The infested plants will be treated at the
appropriate time. The pest status of Mf in Austria is as follows:
Present, only in 2 locations.

[The common name of the disease caused by Mf is brown rot (Br). This
is the third report in 2002 documenting Br in peach orchards, the
others being reported in France and Australia. Br symptoms in peach
include the collapse of young blossom spurs and associated leaves,
resulting in shoot blight. Gum exudes at base of infected flowers,
and cankers on blighted twigs have tan centers with dark margins.
Masses of gray-brown spore form on diseased flower parts and twig
cankers under high humidity.
Mf overwinters primarily on mummified fruit that fall to the ground
in late fall or early winter. Mummies in the trees as well as those
on the ground may also produce conidia, which may also serve as the
primary inoculum source in some years. Twig lesions apparently do not
produce spores. All flower parts except sepals are susceptible. Only
infections of stamens lead to brown rot blossom blight.
Early-maturing cultivars typically show little brown rot. Spraying at
blooming tends to reduce blossom and twig blight and helps to
minimize loss caused by the disease. Removal of remaining fruit from
trees soon after harvest will help reduce inoculum the following
spring.
A number of chemical treatments are available for disease management
in orchards. Effective control of postharvest damage to fresh fruit
is essential to maintain high-quality fruit.
