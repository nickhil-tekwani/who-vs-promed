Mount Isa's booming illegal prostitution trade has been blamed for an outbreak of syphilis in the north western mining town. The state government on Sunday [12 Feb 2012] launched an education campaign in north west communities to raise awareness about the curable sexually transmissible infection and encourage residents to have regular testing.

A total of 5 cases of syphilis have been reported in the Mount Isa Health Service District already this year. There were 16 cases in the region in 2010 and more than 80 cases in 2011.

The manager of the My Room Brothel, who asked not to be named, said illegal operations were placing the region's customers at risk. She said her establishment, which became Mount Isa's only legal brothel when it opened in January 2008, was forced to comply with strict hygiene standards enforced by the state government, but freelance working girls [so-called "coal girls"] were free to do as they wish. "It's pretty common knowledge around town that the illegal working girls will do anything you want if the price is right," she said.

Sexual Health Services staff specialist Dr Arun Menon said the outbreak could be contained if people listened to the warnings.

[The Kirby Institute at the University of New South Wales in Sydney (see "HIV, viral hepatitis and sexually transmissible infections in Australia Annual Surveillance Report 2011" available at http://www.med.unsw.edu.au/NCHECRweb.nsf/resources/2011/$file/KIRBY_ASR2011.pdf) found that the rate of diagnosis of infectious syphilis increased sharply in the male population from 5.2 per 100 000 population in 2005 to 12.1 in 2007 and then slowly declined to 8.9 in 2010 in almost all State and Territory jurisdictions of Australia. The rates in the Northern Territory were substantially higher than those in other State/Territories. The rates of infectious syphilis were said to be "almost completely confined to men who have sex with men". The Gay Community Periodic Survey indicated that the proportion of Queensland respondents who reported unsafe sexual behavior increased from around 22 per cent in the years from 2001 to 2005, to 25 per cent in the years from 2006 to 2010.

With a population of 18 857 in the city of Mount Isa and 31 000 in the surrounding district (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Isa), the incidence of infectious syphilis would be either 85 per 100 000 in the city or 52 per 100 000 in the surrounding district, whichever is the appropriate denominator for the year 2010. The corresponding rate in 2011 is either 424 or 258 per 100 000.

In contrast to the rest of Australia, where the sexual activity that results in infectious syphilis has been attributed mainly to sex between men, the very high incidence of infectious syphilis in Mount Isa is attributed in the news release above to heterosexual activity with prostitutes. Fly-in/fly-out or drive-in/drive-out women sex workers traveling from great distances to the mining regions of Queensland are said to be making as much money in one or 2 days as mine laborers earn in a week. The women stay for a few days or weeks in hotels, motels, or caravan parks before returning home or moving on to the next mining town in a circuit. It is said to be legal, but unregulated, for these women to work as sole operators as long as they don't solicit in public (http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/coal-girls-hit-paydirt-at-mines/story-e6freoof-1226186661381).

Mount Isa is a city in the Gulf Country region of Queensland, Australia, with vast mineral deposits of lead, silver, copper, and zinc found in the region (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Isa).
