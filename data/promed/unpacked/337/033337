FAO pledges 350 000 doses of foot & mouth disease vaccines
--------------------------------------------------
The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation has pledged 350 000
doses of foot-and-mouth vaccines for Zimbabwe's Department of Veterinary
Services, following pleas for assistance to fight the disease to the
Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) and the South African government.
Veterinary Services principal director Stuart Hargreaves said Zimbabwe had
approached the SADC secretariat last year for help in fighting foot and
mouth disease (FMD), an outbreak of which resulted in the suspension of
regional and international beef exports in 2002.
Hargreaves said Zimbabwe, hampered by severe foreign currency shortages
from importing FMD medication, had requested 2.3 million of doses of
vaccines from the SADC secretariat.
Meanwhile, the South African Meat Industry Company (Samic), worried about
the spread of the disease beyond Zimbabwe's borders, has also appealed to
its government to assist the cash-strapped Zimbabwean authorities by paying
for vaccines.
Hargreaves told the Financial Gazette: "We are still waiting for a
response. But on Friday I was informed verbally that the Food and
Agriculture Organisation will be giving us 350 000 doses of vaccines for
fighting the foot-and-mouth disease."
He said although FMD was a "major regional problem", southern African
countries needed international assistance to deal with the disease, which
could be spread easily through the illegal trade in animals and their products.
The movement of cattle from Zimbabwe, for instance, is believed to have
contributed to the outbreak last week of FMD in Botswana, which has led to
the suspension of meat, dairy and hide imports to South Africa and the
European Union (EU).
Indiscriminate movement of animals within Zimbabwe itself is believed to
have resulted in the outbreak of FMD in Matabeleland last year, which also
forced the EU and South Africa to suspend Zimbabwean meat imports.
The illegal movement of animals in Zimbabwe has been facilitated by the
government's controversial land reform programme, which has led to wildlife
and cattle being moved around the country indiscriminately.
Samic chief executive Manie Booysen said the only way to protect South
Africa's meat industry from the devastating impact of FMD was for that
country's government to foot the bill for Zimbabwe's vaccines.
He said that his organisation had urged the South African government to
provide vaccines, at an estimated cost of between R14 million and R25
million [1.60-2.86 million US Dollars], since Zimbabwe did not have
adequate foreign currency to import medication.
"The appeal was done on behalf of veterinary services in the region because
we are seriously concerned about what is happening down there," Booysen
told the Financial Gazette.
"From our side, we had a meeting where we realised that there was a need to
fight the disease from the source, which is that side," he added.
Booysen said because of FMD, South Africa had stopped buying meat and hides
from Zimbabwe. However, he said the products were still finding their way
to South African because of rampant smuggling.

Zimbabwe foot and mouth hits neighbours in Johannesburg
--------------------------------------------------
The political and economic chaos in Zimbabwe was blamed yesterday for an
alarming spread of foot and mouth [FMD] among cattle in neighbouring
countries that is putting southern Africa's meat industry at risk.
Angry farmers in Botswana, South Africa, Mozambique, and Zambia say that
assurances given by the Zimbabwean authorities that outbreaks of the
highly-contagious disease were under control were "dangerously misleading".
They said that the outbreak, first detected in herds in the east of the
country last July, was in danger of running out of control throughout the
region, because the Zimbabwe government did not have the foreign exchange
needed to pay for vaccine.
They also argued that the Harare government could not control the
cross-border movement of cattle by small farmers to raise money to feed
their families in a country where 8 million people are facing starvation.
"The situation is out of control," said Gerhard Schutte of the South
African Red Meat Producers' Organisation. "The devastation that can be
created in South Africa is much larger than the problem Zimbabwe has in
trying to find the foreign exchange necessary to pay for vaccine."
Botswana, which shares an 800-mile unfenced border with Matabeleland in
eastern Zimbabwe, is suffering widespread outbreaks of the disease and
hundreds of head of cattle have had to be destroyed.
Stuart Hargreaves, principal veterinary officer in Zimbabwe's agriculture
department, said there was no confirmation that the outbreak of FMD in
Botswana originated in Zimbabwe. But he admitted that there was smuggling
of cattle across the border by farmers seeking to take advantage of the
favourable exchange rate of the Botswana pula, the strongest currency in
the region.
Cattle farmers in Zimbabwe's other neighbours have reported signs of the
disease among small, informal farming communities close to the border.
