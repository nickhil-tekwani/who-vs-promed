New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1 (WCP_AHS_2014_001): WCP_AHS_2014_001, Bergriver, Western Cape Province

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals.
Measures to be applied: vaccination in response to the outbreak(s).

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
University of Pretoria Veterinary Genetics Laboratory (private laboratory) / Equidae / real-time PCR / 7 Mar 2014 / Positive

Future reporting

[2] Ban on movement of horses in Western Cape
Date: Tue 11 Mar 2014
Source: News 24, South African Press Association (SAPA) report [edited]
http://www.news24.com/Green/News/22-horses-dead-in-SA-due-to-horse-sickness-20140311


A ban on the movement of horses in a specific zone in the Western Cape was enforced after 22 horses died of African horse sickness in South Africa.

The precautionary measure was established after 2 horses were diagnosed with African horse sickness (AHS), the department said in a statement. "2 horses have tested positive for AHS on a holding situated between Saron and Porterville, south-east of the R44," it said.

The order stated that "no horses, mules, donkeys, or zebras [equids] may be moved within, out of, or through" a specified area.

The area included the N7 running from the Berg River, through the Piekenierskloof Pass in the north-east, while the town of Gouda served as the southern boundary of the zone.

"This movement ban will come into force immediately and remain in force until repealed by a further order issued by the department."

Last month [February 2014], the movement of horses in the province was also restricted to prevent the spread of the disease. Direct horse movements to the province's AHS control area were strongly discouraged to help protect local horses.

A total of 34 suspected or confirmed cases of AHS had been reported in the country this season, and 22 horses had died.

"Due to persistent high rainfall in the rest of the country, the number of cases has increased dramatically and [they] are also occurring earlier than in previous years."

The summer rainfall provinces had conditions conducive to the spread of AHS, which was transmitted by insects.

The area immediately surrounding Kenilworth, Cape Town, from where all South Africa's horse exports departed, was free of the disease.

[African horse sickness (AHS) (peste equina africana, peste equine) is an infectious, non-contagious arthropod borne disease of equidae, caused by a double-stranded RNA _Orbivirus_ belonging to the family _Reoviridae_. 9 antigenically distinct serotypes of AHSV have been identified by virus neutralization.

AHS is enzootic in sub-Saharan Africa, although occasional outbreaks have occurred in northern Africa (1965, 1989-1990), the Middle East (1959-1961), and in Europe (Spain, 1966, 1987-1990, and Portugal, 1989).

There are 4 classical clinical forms of AHS: pulmonary, cardiac, mixed, and horse sickness fever. The peracute, pulmonary form occurs in fully susceptible animals and has a short course, often only a few hours, and a high mortality rate. The animal exhibits respiratory distress, an extended head and neck, and profuse sweating. Terminally, froth exudes from the nostrils. The cardiac, oedematous form has a more subacute course with mortality reaching 50 percent. The head and neck may show severe swelling that can extend down to the chest. Swelling of the supraorbital fossae is characteristic and may include conjunctival swelling with petechiae. Paralysis of the oesophagus may result in aspiration pneumonia and sublingual haemorrhages are always a poor prognostic sign. The mixed, acute form is most commonly seen and has feature of both the cardiac and pulmonary forms. Horse sickness fever is an often overlooked, mild form of the disease and is seen in resistant equidae such as zebra and donkeys.

The disease has both a seasonal (late summer/autumn) and a cyclical incidence with major epizootics in southern Africa during warm-phase events. Mortality due to AHS is related to the species of equidae affected and to the strain or serotype of the virus. Among equidae, horses are the most susceptible to AHS with a mortality rate of 50-95 percent, followed by mules with mortality around 50 percent. In enzootic regions of Africa, donkeys are very resistant to AHS and experience only subclinical infections. In European and Asian countries, however, donkeys are moderately susceptible and have a mortality rate of 10 percent. Zebras are also markedly resistant with no clinical signs, except fever, and may have extended viraemia (up to 40 days).
