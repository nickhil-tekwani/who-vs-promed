Angola: possible illness hitting Caungula District revealed
-----------------------------------------------------------
The medical commission created by the Chancellery of the state run
Agostinho Neto University (UAN) suspects that the illness that has been
hitting Caungula District, in the eastern Lunda-Norte Province, is tropical
spastic paraparesis [TSP], ANGOP [Angola Press Agency] has learnt. This was
stated in a press conference by the dean of the Medicine Faculty with UAN
and coordinator of the mentioned commission, Miguel Bettencourt, who
travelled to the locality.

"In a clinical assessment made mainly in the villages of Monakaje and
Lukwokeza, at Caungula District, it was concluded that the disease tropical
spastic paraparesis (TSP), an illness that has already been reported in
Mozambique and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). At this
moment, it is not possible to say what is the cause of this illness,
although there are indications that it is caused [either] by the bitter
manioc which contains cyanide, a chemical and toxic element, [or] HTLV
[human T-cell lymphotropic virus] infection."

The expert said that the illness is characterised by reduction of muscular
strength of the arms, marked by a rigidity of the legs, hindering thus the
movements. "This situation is worrying and with serious social and economic
results, particularly in Monacaje village, were 40 per cent of the cases
were recorded, among children and adults," he explained.

Samples of the bloods of patients, as well as of the manioc, have already
been sent to a laboratory in South Africa.

[Tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP) predominantly affects the spinal cord,
resulting in an upper motor neuron syndrome, mostly affecting the lower
limbs. TSP results in inflammation, demyelination, and necrotic lesions in
the spinal cord. It is a progressive disease involving the degeneration of
neurons in the spinal cord, leading to a gradual paralysis of the lower limbs.

The cause of TSP was obscure until the mid-1980s, when an important
association was established between the human retrovirus -- human T-cell
lymphotropic virus type 1 (also known as HTLV-1) -- and TSP. TSP is now
called HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis or
HAM/TSP. The HTLV-1 retrovirus is thought to cause at least 80 per cent of
the cases of HAM/TSP by impairing the immune system. In addition to
neurological symptoms of weakness and muscle stiffness or spasms, in rare
cases individuals with HAM/TSP also exhibit uveitis (inflammation of the
uveal tract of the eye), arthritis (inflammation of one or more joints),
pulmonary lymphocytic alveolitis (inflammation of the lung), polymyositis
(an inflammatory muscle disease), keratoconjunctivitis sicca (persistent
dryness of the cornea and conjunctiva), and infectious dermatitis
(inflammation of the skin). The other serious complication of HTLV-1
infection is the development of adult T-cell leukemia or lymphoma. Nervous
system and blood-related complications occur only in a very small
proportion of infected individuals, while most remain largely without
symptoms throughout their lives.

The HTLV-1 virus is transmitted person-to-person via infected cells:
breast-feeding by mothers who are seropositive (in other words, have high
levels of virus antibodies in their blood), sharing infected needles during
intravenous drug use, or having sexual relations with a seropositive
partner. Less than 2 per cent of HTLV-1 seropositive carriers will become
HAM/TSP patients. HAM/TSP is a progressive disease, but it is rarely fatal.
Most individuals live for several decades after the diagnosis. Their
prognosis improves if they take steps to prevent urinary tract infection
and skin sores, and if they participate in physical and occupational
therapy programs (see
<http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/tropical_spastic_paraparesis/tropical_spastic_paraparesis.htm>).

Populations at risk include those in areas where the HTLV-1 virus is
endemic such as the Caribbean, equatorial Africa, South America, the
Seychelles, and southern Japan. It is estimated that 10-20 million people
worldwide are infected with HTLV-1.

In the case of the outbreak of illness in Caungula District, in the eastern
Lunda-Norte Province of Angola it is uncertain whether the outbreak can be
attributed to HTLV-1 infection or is a consequence of manioc poisoning.

Cassava [manioc] is the 3rd largest source of carbohydrates for human food
in the world. Cassava is classified as "sweet" or "bitter" depending on the
level of toxic cyanogenic glucosides; improper preparation of bitter
cassava causes a disease called konzo. Nevertheless, farmers often prefer
the bitter varieties because they deter pests, animals, and thieves. Konzo
is a paralytic disease among very poor rural populations whose diets for
the weeks and months prior to onset consist almost exclusively of roots of
bitter cassava.

The outcome of diagnostic testing in South Africa is awaited.
