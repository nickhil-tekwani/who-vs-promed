Fumihiro Kodama, Shunji Egawa, Atsushi Nagasaka, Keita Matsuno, Kentaro Yoshii, Hirofumi Takazawa, et al. Discovery of a tick-borne acute febrile illness caused by a novel Orthonairovirus (Yezovirus) in Hokkaido. IASR. 2020; 41(1): 11-13.

In Hokkaido, a new orthonairovirus, which had not been reported before, was detected in a patient who had complained of fever and lower limb pain after bite of a tick. It is considered necessary to develop testing methods and conduct more detailed research on this new virus infection.

Patient
The patient was a male in his 40s living in Sapporo who had a history of hyperuricemia and hyperlipidemia. In mid-May (the day of the bite) [2019], he stayed for about 4 hours in a forest in the central Hokkaido area to collect wild plants. There was no witnessing or biting of the tick on the same day, and his physical condition remained as usual. In the evening of the next day after biting, he noticed a rice-sized tick biting on his right abdomen and removed it himself. On the 5th morning after biting, a fever of the order of 39 deg C [102 deg F] appeared and continued thereafter. On the 7th day after the bite, both lower limbs became painful, and walking became difficult. On the 9th day after the bite, he was admitted to the Sapporo City Hospital for examination and treatment.

At admission, blood pressure 138 / 96mmHg, pulse 99 / min, body temperature 38.9 deg C [102 deg F]. In the right lower abdomen, small papules, which seemed to be insect bites, and redness around the papules were observed, but no other abnormal physical findings were observed. At admission, leukocytes 1600 / microliter (Baso 1.0%, Eos 1.0%, Stab 3.0%, Gran 65.0%, Lym 24.0%, Mono 5.0%, A-Ly 1.0%), hemoglobin 15.2g / dL, platelets 87 000 / microliter, D-dimer 5.5 microgram / mL, AST 3703 U / L, ALT 1783U / L, LDH 4069 U / L, ALP 188 U / L, CK 5847 U / L, CRP 0.63mg / dL, ferritin 55, 200 ng / mL. Urinalysis revealed occult blood 3+, 1-4 red blood cells / HPF, and myoglobinuria. HBs antigen, HBc antibody, HCV antibody, HIV1 / 2 screening test, IgM-HAV antibody, IgG-HAV antibody, IgA-HEV antibody, TP antibody qualification, and RPR qualification were negative. The EBV DNA was 4500 copies / mL, but the EBV antibody was positive for both VCA IgG and EBNA IgG antibodies, and negative for both VCA IgM and EA IgG antibodies, indicating a pre-infected pattern. Cytomegalovirus antibody was negative for both IgM and IgG antibodies, and CMV antigenemia (C10 / 11 method) was negative. Chest and abdominal pelvic contrast-enhanced CT showed no obvious source of infection or organ enlargement.

On the day of admission, relapse fever and Lyme disease were suspected, and ceftriaxone was started. On the 3rd day of hospitalization, rickettsial infection was suspected as doxycycline, and rabies disease was suspected, and gentamicin was added. A bone marrow biopsy performed on the same day showed that most of the samples were peripheral blood, but slight hemophagocytosis was observed. On the 5th day of hospitalization, marked atypical lymphocytosis (white blood cells 8200 / microliter, A-Ly 76.0%) appeared, but CD45 gating, bone marrow biopsy, and clinical course ruled out hematopoietic malignancy. Lyme disease IgM / IgG antibody, recurrent fever IgM / IgG antibody, tick-borne encephalitis virus neutralizing antibody, Japanese encephalitis virus neutralizing antibody, Tularemia antibody, _Rickettsia_ antibody negative on the day of hospitalization and on the 15th day of hospitalization, blood culture on the day of hospitalization 2 sets, Lyme disease _Borrelia_ PCR, recurrent fever _Borrelia_ PCR, and severe febrile thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) virus PCR were negative. These tests did not lead to the diagnosis of _Borrelia_ infection, _Rickettsia_ infection, tularemia, tick-borne encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis, or SFTS. Antibiotics were administered ceftriaxone for 8 days, doxycycline for 14 days, and gentamicin for 6 days. His symptoms improved from the 5th day of hospitalization and was discharged home on the 15th day of hospitalization without any sequelae.

On the 2nd day of hospitalization, a small erythema, which was considered to be a tick bite site, was examined by skin biopsy and examined closely. From the skin specimen, an amplification product of the gltA gene region consistent with _Rickettsia helvetica_ was obtained, suggesting tick biting.

Orthonairovirus detection history
Genetic testing for flavivirus, alphavirus, and phlebovirus was negative due to a strong suspicion of viral disease, but the test was negative. The serum of the patient on the day of hospitalization was inoculated into Vero cells, and the culture supernatant was analyzed with a next-generation sequencer. Testing was performed using primers to detect this gene fragment. As a result, viral genes were detected in patient serum and urine for about 10 days after hospitalization.

Further analysis revealed that the nucleotide sequence of the 3-segment RNA of the orthonairovirus gene could be determined. This virus was referred to as Yezo virus (YEZV). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that YEZV was a novel virus closely related to the Tamdy serogroup (Figure). https://www.niid.go.jp/niid/images/iasr/2020/1/479d01f01.pdf

----------- Yezo virus
--------------- Tamdy orthonairovirus
---------------------- Huangpi Tick Virus 1
------------------------- Tamdy virus
-------------------------- Tacheng Tick Virus 1
---------------------------- Wenzhou Tick Virus
------------------------------- Burana virus

Consideration
Viral febrile illness was strongly suspected from the patient's condition. The possibility of acute febrile illness caused by YEZV is extremely high because the YEZV gene is no longer detected with recovery of the patient and the exclusion diagnosis of other diseases. Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia with fever were similar to SFTS, another viral tick-borne disease. Significantly high levels of ferritin suggested hemophagocytic syndrome, but a definitive diagnosis was not made in the bone marrow specimens examined here. In addition, bilateral lower limb pain, elevated CK, and myoglobinuria suggested that this patient was characterized by myositis and rhabdomyolysis-like pathology.

Many viruses of the genus _Orthonairovirus_ are tick-borne, and several pathogenic viruses have been identified. In particular, Tacheng tick virus 1, which belongs to the Tamdy serogroup closely related to YEZV, has been reported to be associated with tick-borne febrile illness in China. Therefore, it is highly probable that YEZV will cause tick-borne febrile illness. Isolation of the virus and detection of antibodies in the convalescent serum are currently under trial.

In the future, it is necessary to closely monitor the occurrence of patients with similar diseases and investigate the occurrence trends of YEZV infection. In particular, patients with SFTS-like symptoms for whom SFTS virus infection was denied should be suspected of YEZV infection, both inside and outside Hokkaido. It is also urgently necessary to investigate the status of YEZV infection in ticks and wildlife, and to clarify the distribution area of the virus.

The National Institute of Infectious Diseases revealed that a new virus was detected in [a man] who had symptoms such as fever after being bitten by a tick. The patient recovered after his general condition worsened, such as being unable to walk at a time, but the lab says it may need to find more patients and need to establish a testing regime.

According to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, a man in his 40s who picked wild plants in Hokkaido in May last year [2019] noticed that he was bitten by a tick. He had a fever and pain in both feet, making it impossible to walk, and was hospitalized.

The man had a decrease in white blood cells and platelets, and his general condition worsened, including inflammation of his leg muscles.

When Hokkaido University and the National Institute of Infectious Diseases examined blood and other data, [a new virus] was discovered that had not been reported before. The virus is close to the virus that causes the tick-borne infection, SFTS (severe febrile thrombocytopenia syndrome).

"There is a possibility that we will find more in the future. It is necessary to promote research for the development of diagnostics and therapeutic methods and establish a testing system," said Masayuki Saijo, director of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases.

[The discovery of a new virus raises many questions: How many people have been infected clinically or subclinically? Are wild or domestic animals infected in nature? Which species of ticks transmit the virus, and what proportion of the tick population has the virus? One hopes there will be follow-up studies that will answer these questions. - Mod.TY
