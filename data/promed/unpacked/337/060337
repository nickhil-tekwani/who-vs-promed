Alert for an outbreak of Rickettsia in Michoacan, Mexico
--------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health in Michoacan warned on Friday, 30 Dec 2011,
of an outbreak of Rickettsia infection at the port of Lazaro Cardenas.
The head of the agency, Guadalupe Hernandez Alcala, announced that so
far 25 cases have been confirmed.

Hernandez Alcala pointed out that in total 90 cases were referred to
the State Laboratory of Public Health, of which 25 were positive, 9
males and 16 females, aged from 5 to 65 years of age. At the time, he
explained, local spraying would be undertaken and relevant
epidemiological fences put in place to prevent further spreading of
this disease, curable with therapeutic antimicrobial treatment
[usually a tetracycline - Mod. LL].

The general public is advised to keep their yards and their houses
clean, apply ordinary hygiene in the bathroom, and importantly on
any suspicion of disease, especially in children and older adults, go
to their nearest health center.
