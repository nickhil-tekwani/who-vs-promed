South Australia (SA) Health has issued a public health warning after
an employee at the Vatan supermarket in Kilburn was diagnosed with
hepatitis A. The supermarket, on Prospect Road, Kilburn, specialises
in retailing products to the Afghani community.

SA Health's Director of Public Health, Dr Kevin Buckett, said the
employee worked on the butcher's counter while infectious on 11, 12
and 13 Dec [2009]. "While the chances of becoming infected are small,
we're asking customers who bought produce from the butcher's counter
during the infectious period to be aware of the risk," Dr Buckett said.

"Hepatitis A has an incubation period of 15 to 50 days, with most
people developing symptoms approximately 30 days after exposure.
"Symptoms of hepatitis A include abdominal pain, nausea, fever and
chills and jaundice. Anyone who experiences these symptoms should
contact their GP [General Practitioner]. I would also advise anyone
who feels they may have been exposed to hepatitis A to talk to their
GP about receiving a vaccination against the virus, which could help
to protect them even after exposure to the infection."

Hepatitis A is spread when traces of faecal matter containing the
virus contaminate hands, objects, water or food and are then taken in
by mouth. Employees from Vatan Supermarket have been offered a
vaccination against hepatitis A. SA Health continues to work with the
supermarket to inform the local Afghan community of the alert.

55 cases of hepatitis A have been reported in South Australia so far
this year [2009]. 19 cases were reported in SA in 2008.

[Hepatitis A is a liver infection caused by hepatitis A virus (HAV).
The virus is spread when an uninfected (or unvaccinated) person eats
or drinks something contaminated by the stool of an HAV-infected
person. The disease is closely associated with inadequate sanitation
and poor personal hygiene. Unlike hepatitis B and C, hepatitis A
infection does not cause chronic liver disease and is rarely fatal,
but it can cause debilitating symptoms. The symptoms of hepatitis A
range from mild to severe, and can include fever, malaise, loss of
appetite, diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal discomfort, dark-colored urine
and jaundice (a yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes). Not
everyone who is infected will have all of the symptoms. Adults have
signs and symptoms of illness more often than children, and the
severity of disease and mortality increases in older age groups.
Infected children under 6 years of age do not usually experience
noticeable symptoms, and only 10 percent develop jaundice. Among
older children and adults, infection usually causes more severe
symptoms, with jaundice occurring in more than 70 percent of cases.
Most people recover in several weeks, or sometimes months, without
complications. For further information, see:
