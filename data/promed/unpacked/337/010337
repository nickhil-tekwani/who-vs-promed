Health officials are warning of a possible outbreak of measles in Kent
after 18 cases of the disease were reported in the Medway towns.
On the Isle of Sheppey, 3 adult prisoners at Elmley Prison have gone down
with the virus, along with 6 children at Lordswood Primary School, Chatham.
The others are individual cases which have been reported to general
practitioners (GPs).
Kent Health Protection Agency blamed the cases on low take-up of the MMR
jab, which was below 82 per cent in Medway.
Of the 18 reported cases, 3 have been confirmed, with 15 more suspected,
and 2 of the affected children are in hospital.
The agency has written to GPs warning them of the outbreak and asking them
to ensure that unvaccinated children and young people under 25 are offered
MMR. Letters have also been sent to Lordswood parents, while prisoners at
Elmley will be offered the jab on Thursday.
"We have never had this number of cases of measles in Kent," said director
of the agency Dr Mathi Chandrakumar. "Because vaccine coverage is below
what I would like to see, this may be the beginning of an outbreak of measles."
Doctors ideally want to see at least 90 per cent take-up of MMR in young
children but it has dropped because of health scares in recent years. Dr
Chandrakumar said studies had shown the combined measles, mumps and rubella
vaccine was completely safe.
