From 0 to 24:00 on [3 Apr 2020], 31 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government) and Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps reported 19 newly diagnosed cases, of which 18 cases were imported from abroad and 1 was a local case (1 case in Hubei).

As of 24:00 on [3 Apr 2020], according to the reports of 31 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, there were 1562 confirmed cases (including 331 severe cases). A total of 76 755 cases recovered and were discharged, and 3326 deaths were reported. A total of 81 639 confirmed cases and 114 suspected cases have been reported.

There was 1 newly confirmed case in Hubei (in Wuhan), 150 newly recovered cases (all in Wuhan), 4 new deaths (all in Wuhan), and 834 confirmed cases (830 cases in Wuhan). Among them, 303 were severe cases (300 cases in Wuhan). A total of 63 762 patients recovered and were discharged (46 611 in Wuhan), a total of 3207 deaths were reported (2567 in Wuhan), and 67 803 cases were confirmed (50 008 in Wuhan).

[Today breaks the 10th consecutive days with no newly confirmed cases with local transmission reported from Wuhan or Hubei province in its entirety in the past 24 hours. While there are no newly suspected cases in Wuhan or Hubei, there was 1 newly confirmed locally transmitted case in Wuhan. 19 new cases were confirmed, 18 were imported.

According to the report above, a total of 81 639 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 3326 deaths, representing an increase of 31 cases in the 24 hours since yesterday's (2 Apr 2020) report was prepared. An additional 11 suspected cases were reported, all imported. In addition, 4 deaths were reported, all from Wuhan. 43 new cases were reported from Hong Kong, where numbers of newly confirmed cases continue to increase daily. And Macau has reported 2 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. The periodic sporadic case confirmed in Wuhan suggests that the virus is still circulating there at low levels as these sporadic cases are not occurring on a daily or even weekly basis.

A total of 18 newly confirmed cases were imported cases into China. Origins of importation were not available but the total number of imported cases is now 888. There are an additional 114 suspected imported cases. Clearly the challenge for China now is the identification of infections in imported cases, tracing their contacts, and preventing the recurrence of community wide transmission.

As best as I can decipher from the report above, there were 64 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic people in the past 24 hours, 26 in imported cases. The total number of asymptomatic individuals currently under observation (and isolation) is 1030, 239 of whom are importations from abroad. 3 originally asymptomatic cases have developed symptoms in the past 24 hours (2 were imported cases).

As reported on 24 Mar 2020, China ended the lockdown in Hubei and will end it in Wuhan on 6 Apr 2020. There is much caution and skepticism in the media over the reality of the zero case reports. The world will be watching carefully to see if this is safe timing...

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 94 cases and 3 deaths as compared with yesterday's 24 hour period (2 Apr 2020-3 Apr 2020) when there were 86 newly confirmed cases. A total of 10 156 confirmed cases, including 177 deaths were reported today, up from 10 062 cases and 174 deaths yesterday [2 Apr 2020]. The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 13 consecutive days. Daegu continues to stand out as a focal point for transmission with 66.6% of the total cases reported followed by Gyeongbuk with 12.9% of the total cases reported. In the past 24 hours, Daegu reported 28.7% of the total newly confirmed cases while Gyeonggi represented 24.5% of the newly confirmed cases, and Seoul represented 23.4%. Quarantined imported cases represented 16.0% of the newly confirmed cases.

As seen in China, Korea is identifying increasing numbers of imported cases returning to South Korea. There are now 279 imported cases in quarantine with the 1st report of patients in quarantine on 16 Mar 2020, when 4 cases were reported (COVID-19 update (41): global, surge capacity, vaccine development, WHO 20200316.7096222). As in China, there is strict surveillance and follow-up of these individuals, reversing the pattern of the western countries strengthening screenings of individuals from South Korea and China. There are obvious concerns regarding initiating new clusters that might escape into the community.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 119 827 cases, including 14 681 deaths, up from 115 242 cases and 13 915 deaths reported on 2 Apr 2020. The 24-hour change between 2 and 3 Apr 2020 was 4585 newly confirmed cases, compared with 4668 newly confirmed cases between 1 Apr 2020 and 2 Apr 2020, stable from yesterday's observations. Cases continue to be concentrated in the northern part of the country -- in Lombardy (47 520), the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna (15 932), and Piedmont (10 896). These 3 provinces combined account for 56.6% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Veneto, also in the north, continues to be active, with a total of 10 464 cases, representing 7.7% of newly reported cases. There is an excellent interactive map at http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1 to visualize the caseloads per region in near real time.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was expanded to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of non-essential businesses. It is now 24 days since the start of the lockdown in the north and 22 days since the countrywide lockdown. There does appear to be a positive trend of decreasing daily newly reported cases, still with small hiccups occasionally.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA, as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 277 161, including 7392 deaths, an increase from 245 066 cases and 6075 deaths. New York state, with 103 476 (37.3%) cumulative case reports and 10 423 (32.5%) newly confirmed cases over the past 24 hours, is clearly the epicenter of the outbreak in the USA, although case reporting elsewhere is increasing. New York City, according to the state tracking website accounts for 55.6% of the total reported cases. Daily reported case counts are accelerating in New Jersey (4305 newly confirmed cases 13.4%), Michigan (1953 newly confirmed cases 6.1%), Massachusetts (1436 newly confirmed cases 4.5%), Florida (1260 newly confirmed cases 3.9%), and California (1240 newly confirmed cases 3.9%); Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Louisiana are very close behind.

A closer look at New York State, the epicenter as of 5:30 AM on 3 Apr 2020, the total number of cases were 102 863, with NYC (New York City) reporting 57 159 cases (55.6% of the total cases). NYC is made of 5 counties: Bronx with 10.8% of total cases in the state, Kings 15.3%, New York (Manhattan) 8.2%, Queens 17.7%, and Richmond 3.6%. Westchester county (12.0%), Nassau County (11.7%), and Suffolk County (9.9%). Together, the NYC counties plus the 3 surrounding contiguous counties mentioned here amount to 91 688 cases or 89.1% of the total cases reported in NY State.

[Transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 in Spain has been rapidly accelerating. As of today (3 Apr 2020), totals of 117 710 cases and 10 935 deaths have been reported, up from 110 238 cases and 10 003 deaths confirmed in the preceding 24 hours. The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population is 207.8. It is now 2nd in Europe, behind Italy, and 3rd globally behind the USA and Italy, in terms of absolute numbers of cases. Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease and one clearly sees the trend for increasing confirmations in recent times. There is also a clear growth curve showing the trajectory of the epidemic at https://covid19.isciii.es/; it is updated daily.

Of the 117 710 cases, 56 637 (48.1%) have been hospitalized and 6416 (5.5%) admitted to the ICU. The crude reported case fatality rate is 9.3%, with more deaths occurring than reported ICU admissions.

La Rioja, Navarre, and Basque Country are located together in the north of the country. Madrid is in the northern part of central Spain and Castile-La Mancha is just to the south of Madrid, with Toledo as its capital. - Mod.MPP]
