African swine fever [ASF] has been detected in the north of the Czech Republic near the border with Poland.

The animal disease had been detected in a dead wild boar, the State Veterinary Authority (SVS) announced on Friday [2 Dec 2022] in Prague. The site of discovery was in the municipality of Jindrichovice pod Smrkem in the so-called Friedländer Zipfel [Frýdlant], around 25 kilometers [15.53 mi] north-east of Liberec and 35 kilometers [21.75 mi] east of the Saxon border town of Zittau [Germany].

The authority now wants to declare an infection area of around 200 square kilometers [49 421 acres]. In this exclusion zone, entering the forests is restricted and hunting wild boar is prohibited. Any animal carcasses should be examined for the disease and disposed of. The disease last appeared in the Czech Republic 4 and a half years ago, but at that time in the eastern administrative region around the industrial city of Zlin.

African swine fever (ASF) is a contagious viral disease in domestic and wild pigs that is almost always fatal and incurable. There is no preventive vaccination. The disease can be transmitted directly from animal to animal or indirectly by humans to other areas via contaminated objects such as clothing, shoes and food. ASF is not contagious or dangerous to humans or other animal species.

[Jindrichovice pod Smrkem is situated about 6 and 30 km (3.73 and 18.64 mi), repectively, from the Polish and German borders; map at https://tinyurl.com/2xbdavuk.

The following complementary information is obtained from the (Czech) source (https://www.africkymorprasat.cz/aktuality/svs-vymezila-pasmo-okolo-mista-nalezu-divocaka-s-amp-a-naridila-v-nem-opatreni-proti-sireni-nakazy):

"The State Veterinary Administration (SVS) defined the so-called zone of infection around the place in Jindřichovice pod Smrkek in Frýdlantsk, where a dead piglet of a wild pig infected with African swine fever was found. In an area of almost 200 km², the SVS ordered extraordinary veterinary measures. Among other things, hunting of game and feeding of wild pigs will be prohibited within their framework. In the zone, the movement of residents outside the marked paths will be restricted and the search and collection of the bodies of dead wild boars will be intensified. The measures are intended to minimize the spread of the disease in the wild boar population and to protect domestic pig farms from the introduction of the disease.

28 cadastral territories of municipalities in the Liberec region are included in the area and listed in the regulation. The municipalities to which the extraordinary measures apply must make an inventory of all pigs kept in households by 9 Dec 2022 at the latest. Farmers who keep pigs for non-commercial purposes will have to have the pigs slaughtered within 10 days.

"It is forbidden to keep pigs outdoors in the infection zone. It is also prohibited to move pigs into the infection zone, except for immediate slaughter at the slaughterhouse. Products of animal origin obtained from wild pigs in the area will only be possible on the basis of a justified exception granted by the Regional Veterinary Administration for the Liberec Region.

"In the event of the discovery of dead wild pigs or deaths in domestic pig farms, it is necessary to contact SVS on the telephone numbers 485 246 691 or 720 995 207 or the e-mail address <epodatelna.kvsl@svscr.cz>".

Effective surveillance, early detection and severe, meticulously applied control and eradication measures allowed the Czech veterinary authorities to achieve the eradication of the previous ASF outbreak in wild boar, on the Republic's eastern border, within 10 months. The outbreak started on 21 June 2017 and was declared "resolved" as of 19 Apr 2018. During the event, the domestic swine population remained free of infection. - Mod.AS
