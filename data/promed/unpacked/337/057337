Veterinary officials in the southern Philippines warned a potential
outbreak of liver fluke diseases as tests showed an abrupt surge in
the number of positive cases among large livestock in the area during
the past weeks, the Philippine Star reported Saturday [8 Sep 2007].
Dr. Lorna Lamorena, veterinarian in South Cotabato Province, said
laboratory tests on samples recently taken from cows, water buffalos,
and horses in the province's 10 towns showed the level of infection
at 89.5 percent.
"This is already very alarming because at that rate we can already
consider that there is an outbreak of fasciolosis (or liver fluke
diseases)," the paper cited her as saying.
Lamorena blamed the erratic weather condition as the cause of
fasciolosis infection surge. The sudden changes of the weather from
dry to wet are considered as among the risk factors that favor the
spread of the disease, she said.
Fasciolosis is a worm infestation caused by the parasite that settles
in the biliary ducts of the livestock and even humans, a report from
the Department of Science and Technology website noted.
It said clinical signs of this disease in cattle showed it could
eventually cause loss of weight, muscle atrophy, fatigue, weakness,
and significant loss of appetite. The disease may be fatal if it
remained untreated.

There are no reports of human infection so far.

[The following data are derived from the Merck Veterinary Manual:
_Fasciola hepatica_, the most important trematode of domestic
ruminants, is the most common cause of liver fluke disease in
temperate areas of the world. _F. hepatica_ is distributed worldwide
and has a broad host range. Economically important infections are
seen in cattle and sheep in 3 forms: chronic, which is rarely fatal
in cattle but often fatal in sheep; subacute or acute, which is
primarily in sheep and often fatal; and in conjunction with "black
disease" (infectious necrotic hepatitis), which is most common in
sheep and usually fatal.
In the USA, it is endemic along the Gulf Coast, the West Coast, the
Rocky Mountain region, and other areas. It is present in eastern
Canada, British Columbia, and South America, and is of particular
economic importance in the British Isles, western and eastern Europe,
Australia, and New Zealand."
The incidence of fasciolosis is related to seasonal and periodic
climatic and meteorologic changes and conditions.
_Fasciola gigantica_ is similar in shape to _F. hepatica_ but is
larger (75 mm), with less clearly defined shoulders. It is found in
warmer climates (Asia, Africa) in cattle and buffalo, in which it is
responsible for chronic fasciolosis, and in sheep, in which the
disease is frequently acute and fatal. The life cycle is similar to
that of _F. hepatica_ except for species of snail intermediate
hosts. The pathology of infection, diagnostic procedures, and control
measures are similar to those for _F. hepatica_ .
Given the tropical climate seen in the Philippines, it is likely that
the aforementioned outbreak is due to _Fasciola gigantica_. - Mods.AS/MPP]
[Metacercariae swimming in contaminated water encysts on water
plants, and when humans eat raw water plants they become infected.
Therefore the infection cannot be transmitted to humans by physical
contact with or by drinking infected water. - Mod.EP]
