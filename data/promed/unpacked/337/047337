SPONGIFORM ENCEPHALOPATHY: HUMAN CASES LINKED TO BSE?
=====================================================
[1]
Does anyone on the list have any information or insight into an announcement
reportedly made today by the British government of an epidemiologic linkage
between BSE [bovine spongiform encephalopathy] and CJD [Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease, a human spongiform encephalopathy]?

A small extract from today's news report follows:
LONDON (Dow Jones)--The U.K. government said that a possible link has been
established between mad cow disease and its human form, Creutzfeldt Jakob
Disease, or CJD.
U.K. health secretary Stephen Dorrell said an advisory committee of
independent scientists found 10 cases of people aged under 42 contracting CJD
were linked to exposure to Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, or BSE,
or mad cow disease, before a ban on use of offal in animal feeds was
introduced in 1989.
