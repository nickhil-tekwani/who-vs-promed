Cruise of Holland America "Amsterdam" Canceled
----------------------------------------------
Holland America has canceled its next 10-day Caribbean cruise aboard the
Amsterdam, as it tries to kill the [gastroenteritis virus] that has plagued
more than 500 passengers spanning 4 consecutive voyages. The cruise line
said it has called off Thursday's sailing to break the person-to-person
cycle of the illness. Symptoms, which generally last one or 2 days, include
vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, headache, and low-grade fever. The
virus [a Norwalk-like virus] can be dangerous for the elderly or those with
medical problems, said an expert with the Centers for Disease Control. "We
want to demonstrate to our passengers that we are doing everything we can
to eliminate this virus," said Holland America spokeswoman Rose Abello.
"And we want our future guests on the Amsterdam to have peace of mind and
confidence in sailing with us."
Onboard the current sailing, which will return Thursday to Port Everglades,
57 passengers and 17 crew members have contracted the sickness. Of those,
28 sick passengers were ordered off the ship Thursday at its first port,
Curacao. On three previous cruises, a total of 438 passengers had been
stricken with the virus. A lawsuit filed on behalf of some sick passengers
was filed Friday in Seattle.
CDC spokeswoman Susan McClure said the agency has been closely monitoring
the ship, but that Holland America voluntarily chose to cancel the 21 Nov
2002 cruise. Historical data show that it takes 4 days of cleaning, with no
passengers on the ship, to significantly reduce the virus amount, she said.
Dr. Gio Baracco, an infectious disease specialist and assistant professor
of medicine at the University of Miami, said it is unknown how long the
virus remains active on surfaces. But victims of the virus still can be
contagious for up to several days after their symptoms have disappeared.
Onboard cruise ships, the virus has become more prevalent since this
summer, said David Forney, chief of the CDC's vessel sanitation program. In
a contained environment, it spreads quickly, despite warnings to passengers
to wash their hands frequently.
The Amsterdam outbreak marks the second time in 4 months that hundreds of
passengers have contracted the virus on one of Holland America's ships. The
Ryndam, which sailed to Alaska in July 2002, reported 395 cases before
being pulled from service, disinfected and returned to sea. There are 2
lawsuits representing the passengers pending.
Though 600 workers sanitized the Amsterdam with a chlorine solution when it
returned to Fort Lauderdale last week -- and crew members have been
continuously cleaning during the current voyage -- the plan now is to
attack the virus much more aggressively. Abello said the ship will be
divided into hundreds of small sections, and each area will be checked and
rechecked. In the staterooms, all the pillows will be replaced, and all the
linens, blankets, bed covers and curtains will be laundered or dry-cleaned
with a special solution. Upholstery will also be sanitized, and carpeting
will be steam-cleaned, she said. At the same time, all the surfaces that
people touch -- elevator buttons, handrails, light switches, TV remote
controls and computer keyboards -- will be disinfected. Refrigerators and
freezers will be cleaned out and the air-conditioning system will be shut
down -- efforts that can only be accomplished without passengers onboard.
"There isn't going to be a square inch of the ship that isn't somehow
cleaned and sanitized," Abello said.
