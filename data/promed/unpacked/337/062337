A total of 386 students at a school in southwest China's Sichuan Province were hospitalized on [Thu 13 Jun 2013], with food poisoning-like symptoms. Local authorities said at a press conference on [Sun 16 Jun 2013] that the case was due to contaminated cafeteria food.

Peng Feng, Director, Meishan Health Bureau, said "Expert consultation and lab tests from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at the provincial, city, and district levels have identified the cause as salmonella-contaminated food. 278 students remain in 5 hospitals, of which 192 have been diagnosed as patients of infectious diarrhea and another 87 are under medical observation."

Around 5 pm on [Thu 13 Jun 2013], some students started exhibiting symptoms of vomiting, dizziness, and fever at Meishan Yingtian School. It is a private school with over 1300 students between the ages of 2 and 17 in its kindergarten, primary, junior, and high-school grades. According to the provincial disease control and prevention center, the bacteria probably entered the food through improperly decontaminated containers.

[It is likely that the food vehicle was served for lunch or dinner on the day before, based on the incubation period of salmonellosis. With 386 affected students reports of a student population about 1300, the attack rate was about 30 percent. - Mod.LL
