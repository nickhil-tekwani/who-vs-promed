Epidemiological update detection of Sabin type 3 vaccine poliovirus in a case of acute flaccid paralysis [15 Jun 2018]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Situation summary
-----------------
The following is an updated information on the case of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) with detection of Sabin type 3 vaccine poliovirus, previously reported in the PAHO/WHO Epidemiological Update of [8 Jun 2018] (*).

The case is a 34-month-old male, unvaccinated, resident of an indigenous community in Delta Amacuro [Orinoco Delta], Venezuela, with paralysis onset on [29 Apr 2018]. The clinical-epidemiological investigation carried out indicated that the flaccid paralysis of a lower limb persisted as of [11 Jun 2018]. Other children from the same community were vaccinated in April [2018] with a bivalent oral polio vaccine, so the case may have contracted the infection through the fecal-oral route.

The laboratory tests (genetic sequencing) recently performed in the regional reference laboratory confirmed the detection of Sabin type 3 poliovirus vaccine in the viral isolate obtained from this patient's sample collected on [30 Apr 2018]. The results of the isolated poliovirus sequencing showed that the virus did not present genetic variation with respect to the prototype vaccine strain (Sabin type 3), thus ruling out a vaccine derived poliovirus (VDPV).

The final classification of the case of AFP (to define whether or not it is associated with the vaccine) will be based on clinical and virological criteria; for this reason the evaluation of the residual neurological deficit is expected 60 days after the onset of the paralysis [28 Jun 2018].

Preliminary results of the field investigation carried out in the community where the case occurred had identified an 8-year-old girl with a vaccine history of at least 1 dose of tOPV (trivalent oral polio vaccine), suspected as AFP. The clinical evaluation subsequently carried out by health professionals has ruled out that this is a case of AFP.

No additional AFP cases have been identified to date through active search for AFP cases carried out in the community.

[This timely PAHO update rules out the possibility of more than one case of AFP in the community where this OPV3 associated AFP case resides, as well as reinforces the background information of recent introduction of bOPV (bivalent OPV including OPV1 and OPV3 viruses) into this community, preceding the onset of paralysis of this child.

We await further information as it becomes available.

Poliovirus weekly update, 13 Jun 2018, World Health Organization
New wild poliovirus cases reported this week: 1
New cVDPV cases reported this week: 0

Headlines
- In response to media reports about a polio case in Venezuela which emerged last week [week of 4 Jun 2018], the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) wishes to clarify that these reports cannot be confirmed at this time. An acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) case, a symptom which is caused by a number of different diseases (polio being just one of them), is currently being investigated. The child is 34 months old, and had onset of paralysis on [29 Apr 2018], from an under-immunized community in Orinoco delta, Delta Amacuro state. A Sabin type 3 poliovirus was isolated from stool samples of the AFP case, and is being further analyzed, including to determine if the paralysis was caused by the isolated strain. Final laboratory results are expected next week. Isolation of Sabin 3 poliovirus is not unusual, and can be expected in children and communities immunized with bivalent oral polio vaccine, which contains both attenuated type 1 and type 3 Sabin strains. As part of global polio surveillance efforts, every year more than 100 000 AFP cases are detected and investigated worldwide. WHO's Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and the GPEI continue to support local public health authorities in conducting an epidemiological and field investigation into this event.

Summary of newly-reported viruses this week

- Since confirmation of cVDPV2 in Nigeria, the country has conducted additional acute flaccid paralysis surveillance strengthening activities including enhanced active surveillance visits, and community sampling. The programme has also carried out extensive search for type 2 containing vaccines (tOPV/mOPV2) in the areas surrounding where the virus was detected.
- The GPEI is working with Regional and country counterparts and partners to supporting the local public health authorities to conduct outbreak response. This includes the implementation of 2 rounds of mOPV2 vaccination in May and June [2018] covering part of Jigawa, Gombe, Bauchi, and Sokoto.

Lake Chad Basin
- The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) in Nigeria continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin.
- Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.
- These activities include efforts to vaccinate children at markets, in internally displaced persons and refugee camps, and at international borders.
- In May [2018], 2 polio vaccination campaigns with bOPV took place, targeting vulnerable island populations in Lake Chad. These special vaccination activities concerned 8 health districts in Chad: Bagasola, Bol, Isseirom, Karal, Kouloudia, Liwa, Mani, and Ngouri.

[The report above officially confirms the earlier media report of an additional WPV1 case in Dukki district of Balochistan, Pakistan (also confirmed by the EpiCore Global Surveillance Project), now bringing the total number of WPV1 associated cases of polio during 2018 to 11, almost double that reported as of this date in 2017. Is this a true increase in cases? Or is this due to enhanced surveillance activities capturing closer to the true occurrence of cases? It is notable there is no mention of positive environmental samples during the past week. If this is not due to delayed surveillance reports, this may be a positive sign of interruption of WPV1 circulation in areas where environmental sampling is being done. It also does not mention newly identified positive environmental samples involving cVDPVs....time will tell.

As for the situation in Venezuela, see the PAHO update in section [1] above. It is notable that there is no mention of the additional AFP cases mentioned in the media report...and that the focus of the investigation involves the solitary case with a reported OPV3 virus isolated from specimens taken from the case. In the original PAHO update (see Poliomyelitis update (19): Venezuela, vaccine virus found, VAPP susp 20180609.5848416), there was mention of a recent vaccination campaign held in the community, during April 2018, preceding the onset of paralysis in the suspected case mentioned above. It appears that reporting of the situation has been somewhat complicated by the local political situation, with incentives and disincentives for reporting among the different factions in the country.

[3] Venezuela: GPEI update late Fri 15 Jun 2018
Date: 15 Jun 2018
Source: Global Polio Eradication Initiative
http://polioeradication.org/news-post/update-on-suspected-polio-case-in-venezuela/


Following unconfirmed reports on [8 Jun 2018] of suspected polio re-emergence in Venezuela, final laboratory testing has confirmed the cause of the paralysis is not wild poliovirus or vaccine-derived poliovirus.

A 34-month old child had presented with symptoms of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) on [29 Apr 2018], from a community with low vaccination coverage in Orinoco delta, Delta Amacuro state.

A Sabin type 3 poliovirus was isolated from stool samples of the child. Isolation of Sabin type 3 poliovirus can be expected in children and communities immunized with bivalent oral polio vaccine, which contains attenuated (weakened) type 1 and type 3 Sabin strains. Final laboratory analysis received today has confirmed that the AFP symptoms are not associated with wild or vaccine-derived poliovirus.

A number of conditions or infections can lead to AFP, poliovirus being just one of them. As part of global polio surveillance efforts, every year more than 100 000 AFP cases are detected and investigated worldwide. Clinical evaluation of the child is underway to determine the cause of the paralysis. The most important point is that the child should be provided with appropriate care and support.

While wild and vaccine-derived polio have both been ruled out as the cause of this child's symptoms, this area of Venezuela is experiencing vaccination coverage gaps. It is critical that countries maintain high immunity to polio in all communities, and strong disease surveillance, to minimize the risk and consequences of any eventual poliovirus re-introduction or re-emergence.

[The above "late breaking" information from the GPEI just came to my attention, hours after this post was prepared by me. To read between the lines, an interpretation of this report is consistent with the PAHO report in section [1] above, stating that the OPV3 virus isolated from this AFP case was a "pure" OPV3 virus, without genetic changes that might be consistent with a VDPV that had reverted in neurovirulence and its ability to continued transmission among a susceptible population. The confusion I have, is whether this is a definitive ruling out of this AFP case being classified as a VAPP (vaccine associated paralytic polio) case in a contact? Again, we await further information and clarification. - Mod.MPP]
