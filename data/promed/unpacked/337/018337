In the localities of Merowe and Ed Debba in Northern State, "fevers accompanied by bleeding and a decrease in blood platelets" resulting in the death of 10 people and leaving hundreds in critical condition were reported yesterday [24 Sep 2020].

As a result, the Northern State Ministry of Health announced a Medical State of Emergency in Merowe locality, and the federal Ministry of Health dispatched a specialized emergency and health intervention team to the locality.

The Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA) in Northern State reported a significant increase of patients in hospitals, especially Karima Hospital, which has strained a nearly collapsed health system. Almost no staff in the hospital are able to receive new patients and there is an acute shortage of life-saving supplies and medicine.

In a statement, the SPA called on the state and federal health ministries to announce the results of the research into the disease, and to intensify sanitation campaigns, in addition to activating blood banks to provide blood.

The SPA expects that the situation will worsen in light of the rainy season and floods.

[The report adds some additional information not contained in the 27 Sep 2020 post (Undiagnosed illness - Sudan: (NO) fatal 20200927.7814971). The number of cases has increased from 8 to 10 and the number of febrile cases from 41 to hundreds. The report also mentions hemorrhage and thrombocytopenia, indicating a febrile hemorrhagic disease. Laboratory results are not available so the etiology of this disease is still unknown.

Yellow fever and dengue are viruses to be confirmed or ruled out. The flooding mentioned in the previous post suggests that leptospirosis, Rift Valley fever (RVF), and enteric pathogens should also be included in the tests, although no mention is made of illness and abortions in ruminant animals that would point to RVF virus infections. ProMED-mail awaits the results of the laboratory tests and further field investigations with interest. - Mod.TY]

[In the absence of additional information on the clinical presentation of the cases, other than fatalities from a febrile illness, it is hazardous to attempt to speculate a differential diagnosis at this time. The range of possible diagnoses includes diseases of viral, bacterial, and parasitic origin. It is tempting to consider a viral hemorrhagic fever as the etiology of the fatal febrile disease outbreak in Sudan, but other diseases such as dengue can also present with low platelet counts and bleeding in secondary cases, so not casting the diagnostic net further at this point seems potentially hazardous at best. - Mod.UBA
