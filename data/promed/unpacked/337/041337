Bird flu is spreading more slowly as warmer spring weather in the
Northern Hemisphere reduces the virus's ability to survive in the environment.

5 outbreaks of the lethal H5N1 avian flu strain in poultry were
reported to the World Organization for Animal Health in the week
ended 27 Apr 2006, compared with an average of more than 40 a week in
March. Diseased fowl raise the risk for humans and create
opportunities for the virus to change into a form that may kill
millions of people.

Scientists are counting on the slowdown in animal infections to
reduce the number of human cases and fatalities. At least 29 people
died of avian flu in the first 3 months of this year, marking the
deadliest quarter yet, as the virus spread through Europe and Africa.

"The peak transmission either in poultry or to humans is in the
winter months," said Robert Webster, the Rosemary Thomas professor at
St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. Webster
has studied influenza viruses for more than 40 years.

Tests have shown that H5N1 can survive in bird feces for at least 35
days at about 4 degrees Celsius (39 degrees Fahrenheit), the World
Health Organization said in January.

"Maybe one of the more positive possibilities is that the summer is
coming and the heat of Africa may be in our advantage," Webster told
reporters yesterday in Singapore, where he addressed an avian flu
forum sponsored by the Lancet medical journal. "Maybe we will have a
summer before it starts spreading more."

Initial avian outbreaks were reported in only 4 countries last month
-- the U.K., Sudan, Burkina Faso and Cote d'Ivoire [see next item] --
compared with 13 in March and 18 in February, according to the World
Organization for Animal Health [OIE].

Studies have shown the virus is capable of surviving longer in warmer
conditions, Webster said. A strain of H5N1 collected from ducks in
Hong Kong in 1997 was able to survive for as long as 2 days at 37
degrees Celsius, while the current viruses from Indonesia and
Thailand take up to 7 days to be destroyed at 37 degrees Celsius, he said.

[2] Cote d'Ivoire, reference laboratory confirmation

Tests at a reference laboratory have confirmed deadly H5N1 bird flu
in Cote d'Ivoire, triggering extra control measures in the 6th African
country hit by the virus, Ivorian animal health authorities said on
Thursday [4 May 2006].

Bakary Cisse, head of Cote d'Ivoire's epidemiological animal health
surveillance network told Reuters that tests by the World
Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) laboratory in Padua, Italy, had
confirmed birds in the main city Abidjan had contracted the virus.

"It's certainly H5N1," Cisse told Reuters.

Poultry sales would be banned within a radius of 3 km (2 miles) of
the sites where H5N1 had been confirmed, he added.

Agriculture Minister Alphonse Douati announced further steps to
control and prevent the spread of the virus, which has killed more
than 100 people since 2003, mainly in Asia.

"We are going to take measures to remove chickens from the markets
(in Abidjan district) for some time," he told reporters on Thursday,
adding that chicken sellers would be reimbursed for birds taken from
them and slaughtered.

"That doesn't mean that all the chickens are ill. We are doing it to
clean and disinfect everywhere they are sold," he added.

The OIE said a week ago the West African country had reported its
first H5N1 outbreaks based on tests by 2 local clinics.

Speaking on state television late on Wednesday evening, Douati said
several ducks and a sparrowhawk had died from bird flu in Abidjan,
the country's main port and business capital. [Picture at

The government is looking for the families who were in contact with
the birds that tested positive and would put them under surveillance
for 10 days, the minister said on Thursday.

Douati also appealed to international bodies including the Rome-based
United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) to help Ivory
Coast control bird flu and ensure safe supplies of chicken, a popular
food source.

Since the spread of the H5N1 virus around the world from Asia became
regarded as inevitable in 2005, many experts have voiced fears that
poor human and animal health infrastructure in Africa would allow it
to spread undetected and unchecked in the poorest continent, where
millions of chickens live in backyards.

In West Africa, Nigeria, Niger, Cameroon and Burkina Faso have
already confirmed outbreaks of H5N1 bird flu in 2006, but so far no
human infections have been found. [The situation in Benin, Togo and
Ghana, now surrounded by infected countries, should be of concern;
see map of Western Africa:
<http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/westafrica.pdf>].

But in Egypt, in Africa's far northeast, at least 13 people have
contracted the disease, including 4 who have died [In fact, a 5th
case has been reported yesterday; see
