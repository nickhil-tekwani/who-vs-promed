USDA ENDS SEVEN-DAY QUARANTINE FOR HORSES FROM MEXICO
WASHINGTON, Jan. 23, 1998--The U.S. Department of Agriculture is removing
the requirement that horses from Mexico be quarantined for seven days in
vector-proof quarantine facilities before being imported into the United
States.
"We have determined Mexico to be free of Venezuelan equine
encephalomyelitis. Lifting the seven-day quarantine requirement would not
pose a risk of transmitting VEE to horses in the United States," said Joan
M. Arnoldi, deputy administrator of veterinary services with the Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service.
A seven-day quarantine became necessary during the summer of 1996 when the
government of Mexico reported that VEE had been detected in horses in that
country. VEE, a viral disease of horses, does not exist in the United
States.
This final rule is scheduled for publication in the Jan. 26 Federal
Register and becomes effective Feb. 10.
Horses imported from Mexico still need to be quarantined until it can be
determined that they are free of exotic pests and diseases but this
quarantine period usually lasts only three to four days.
