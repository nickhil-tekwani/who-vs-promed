On [Wed 16 May 2018], the Anhui Provincial Health Planning Commission issued the report on the epidemic situation of infectious diseases in April. The report shows that in April the province reported a total of 38 918 cases of statutory infectious diseases. Among them, the number of reported cases of hand-foot-mouth disease [HFMD] in the province was 15 447 cases. The Anhui Provincial Health and Family Planning Commission reminded [the reader] that Anhui has entered the season of high incidence of HFMD. The patients are mainly children under 5 years of age. Parents are advised to take preventive measures.

Category C infectious diseases - a total of 9037 cases were reported without deaths. The top 3 diseases reported were hand-foot-mouth disease, other infectious diarrhea, and mumps, accounting for 92.81 percent of the total reported cases of C-type infectious diseases.

Children can be vaccinated with EV71 vaccine to prevent EV71 virus causing severe HFMD and death.

[Anhui is a province of the People's Republic of China located in the eastern region of the country. The province is located across the basins of the Yangtze River and the Huai River, bordering Jiangsu to the east, Zhejiang to the southeast, Jiangxi to the south, Hubei to the southwest, Henan to the northwest, and Shandong for a short section in the north.

In mainland China, significant increases in HFMD morbidity and mortality have caused an enormous burden on the public health system. Nationwide epidemics of HFMD started in 2008, beginning with an outbreak in Anhui province that spread rapidly to other provinces. In total, 488 955 young children suffered in this epidemic that had 1165 severe cases and 126 fatal cases. In response to these large outbreaks, HFMD was listed as a category C notifiable disease in China in May 2008.

HFMD has recently emerged in the Asia-Pacific region as the most severe epidemic disease affecting children. A number of outbreaks of EV71 HFMD in the Asia-Pacific region have been reported since 1997. Over the years, outbreaks have been reported in Malaysia, Taiwan, mainland China, Australia, and Singapore among other areas in the region, making EV71 a public health threat to children in Asia. According to the statistics from National Health and Family Planning Commission of China from 2008 -- 2013, more than 9 million cases of HFMD were reported, resulting in around 2700 reported deaths. For the period 2008 -- 2012, around 80 percent of the severe cases and over 90 percent of fatal cases were caused by EV71.

In December 2015, the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) approved the 1st vaccine against EV71, an inactivated (killed) vaccine made by the Institute of Medical Biology at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. The vaccine developed by the institute showed vaccine efficacy of 97.4 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 92.9 percent - 99.0 percent). Overall, the team identified 155 confirmed cases of EV71-associated HFMD with 4 occurring in the vaccine group and 151 in the placebo group. This vaccine targets children aged 6--71 months, with each child requiring a total of 2 doses one month apart.

A 2nd vaccine, also an inactivated vaccine, developed by Sinovac Biotech Ltd was approved January 2016. The vaccine developed by Sinovac showed a 97.5 percent vaccine efficacy (6 month) and a 94.8 percent vaccine efficacy (12 month) against EV71-associated HFMD cases and 89.3 percent (6 month) and 88.0 percent (12 month) for EV71-associated cases. This vaccine targets children aged 6--35 months, with each child requiring a total of 2 doses 1 month apart.

Some questions remain: Will Chinese manufacturers make the vaccine available to other countries with EV71 outbreaks? Cross-protection of the vaccines against pandemic virus strains? How will they incorporate EV71 vaccine into the EPI? Can the vaccine be co-administered with other vaccines? How do you standardize the vaccine quality control and evaluation of EV71 vaccines?
