A Georgia boy is being treated for rabies after he was attacked by a raccoon on his family's front porch last week [week of 10 Sep 2018]. C.M., 4, was attacked on Thursday [13 Sep 2018], his mother said, and was found in the grips of the rabid animal's paws.

"They got into a tussle on the floor, and he was trying to fight the raccoon off of him, and as he tried to fight him off, the raccoon kept holding on to him and biting him repeatedly," A.M., the boy's mother, told Fox 5 Atlanta. "So we kicked the raccoon off of him. It ran around the house trying to attack everyone."

A.M. said she then shot and killed the animal and rushed her son to Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston. Health officials recommend bringing children who have been bitten by a suspected rabid animal to the emergency department immediately, so that treatment can begin before symptoms set in.

The rabies virus is typically transmitted by a bite from a wild infected animal, such as a bat, raccoon, skunk, or fox, according to KidsHealth. If the bite goes untreated and rabies develops, it is almost always fatal.

The 1st symptoms may appear from a few days to more than a year after the bite occurs and can include tingling, twitching, fever, headache, muscle aches, loss of appetite, nausea, and fatigue. As the infection progresses, it may lead to irritability, excessive movements, confusion, hallucinations, seizures, and more.

According to KidsHealth, if the infection advances, patients may experience double vision, abnormal breathing issues, difficulty swallowing, or increased production of saliva in addition to other issues. Treatment typically involves checking for tetanus immunization and shots of immune globulin as well as a rabies vaccine.

A.M. said her son received his 1st rabies shots on Friday [14 Sep 2018].

According to the CDC, about 7000 cases of rabies in animals are reported each year to the agency. Raccoons are typically the most common carriers in the USA, but bats are more likely to infect people. Newton County Animal Control officials confirmed this is the 1st rabies case reported in the area for 2018. "It makes you nervous a little bit, but I've lived in the woods all my life," J.S., a neighbor, told Fox 5 Atlanta. "I've been wanting to get with the neighbors and take some shotguns to walk through the woods, 3 or 4 of us together."

[In eastern USA, the main terrestrial reservoir of rabies are raccoons (see map of distribution of major rabies virus variants among carnivores at https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/exposure/animals/wildlife_reservoirs.html.

A strategy that has been developed to control and contain the spread of rabies in raccoon is the use of oral rabies vaccination, which can be implemented by distributing bait. - Mod.PMB
