A total of 23 people in the districts of Hoima, Kibaale and
Bundibugyo in Uganda have died following a cholera outbreak.
Addressing journalists in Hoima on 26 May 2006, the District Director
of Health Services, Dr Joseph Ruyonga, said the epidemic had been
confirmed in the sub-counties of Kyangwali, Kabwooya, Buseruka and
Kigorobya.
"The disease has so far killed 10 people in the villages of Nyawaiga,
Buhuka and Nsonga in Kyangwali sub-county," Ruyonga said. He said
cholera patients are admitted at Buseruka, Butoole and Kigorobya
health units in Buseruka, Kabwooya and Kigorobya sub-counties.
"The areas hit by the pandemic are those where the majority of
residents lack toilets," Ruyonga said.
In a related development, the Kibaale District Director of Health
Services, Dr Dan Kyamanywa, said the disease had hit the sub-counties
of Mpeefu and Bwikara. He said the affected areas are the landing
sites of Ndaiga, Kabukanga and Kyaterekera in Mpeefu sub-county and
Bwikara village in Bwikara sub-county. "Cholera has so far killed 3
people including the contractor of Ndaiga Market, Muhereza
Byaruhanga," Kyamanywa said.
In Bundibugyo, 6 people are admitted at Rwebisengo Health Centre and
10 people have been reported dead. The LC3 Chairman of Rwebisengo
sub-county, Mr Assa Wamara, on 28 May 2006 said the victims are
residents of Budiba village. He attributed the outbreak of the
disease to poor sanitation.

During the last 7 weeks, 8 internally displaced people died of
cholera in Kitgum district, according to the District Director of
Health Services, Dr Vincent Oringa.
He said on Mon, 29 May 2006, that at least 350 people had suffered
from cholera in 13 camps in the district. Oringa said 3 people died
in Putika IDP camp, 3 in Kitgum Town Council, 1 in Palabek Gem and 1
in Kitgum Matidi camp.
The first case of the disease was registered in Agoro on 16 May 2006
and spread to another 12 camps. Oringa said although the district had
suspended social functions like funeral rites and selling cooked food
items, people have not heeded to the call, which is a setback to
their effort in fighting the disease.
