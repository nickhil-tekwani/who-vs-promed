Suspect avian disease in Russia
-------------------------------
Information received on (and dated) 22 Jul 2005 from Dr Evgueny A
Nepoklonov, head of the Main Veterinary Department, Ministry of Agriculture
and Food, Moscow:
A poultry disease was registered in 5 villages in the Novosibirsk district
(in the southern part of the country), among birds in non-commercial
premises of open type.
The first signs were found on 15 Jul 2005. Significant mortality was
detected on 18 July. The information, available at 4 pm (GMT+3) 20 July,
suggests that more than 350 birds of different species (geese, ducks,
turkeys, chickens) died.
Some clinical signs invite the suspicion that the outbreak is caused by
highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). But other details of the outbreak
are not typical of HPAI (no evident species specificity, and the pattern of
spread within a settlement). Pathological material was sent to the
reference centre of the Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary
Surveillance (FSVPS). Results of the laboratory diagnosis are expected on
23 Jul 2005.

Over 500 birds dead of bird flu in the Novosibirsk area
-------------------------------------------------------
According to official data, more than 500 birds died in the Novosibirsk
region as result of an avian influenza outbreak. 300 birds died in the
[district] of Dovolenskiy [village of Suzdalka - Mod.NP], and 240 in the
Kupinskiy district. This was announced by the regional press service of the
Russian Emergency Situations Ministry on Fri 22 Jul 2005. No cases of the
disease have been found in the human population.
Alexander Shestopalov, the head of the zoonoses laboratory in the State
Scientific Center for Virology and Biotechnology "Vector," Novosibirsk,
confirmed to the Interfax agency that the flu virus involved in the
outbreak in avians is H5. "Further serotyping of the virus is expected
today Fri, 22 Jul 2005", he said.
It will be possible to say whether the European or Asian virus has caused
this outbreak of disease in birds after test results are in, he added.
Shestopalov further said that death was observed in domestic as well as
wild birds, indicating the high pathogenicity of the virus.
The affected settlements in the Novosibirsk region are within the zone of
Barabinsko-Kulundinskaya lowland, adjacent to a crossroad of bird migratory
routes.
According to Shestopalov, the risks of possible introduction of avian
influenza that might be pathogenic for poultry have never been excluded by
investigators. He explained that wild waterfowl serve as a natural
reservoir of the "type A" viruses, to which avian influenza belongs. On
average, the avian flu virus is detected in 6-10 per cent of tests, which
is within [expectable] levels.
According to Shestopalov, isolates of avian influenza viruses, typed as H1,
H3, H4 and H8, have been obtained in various years from samples taken from
birds. The monitoring of flu virus in migratory birds has been carried out
over the last 4 years by the State Scientific Center for Virology
"Vector"in collaboration with the Institute of systematization and animal
ecology of the Russian academy of sciences.
