Transfusion Associated West Nile Virus Infection: Implications for Europe
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
There was a large increase in reported numbers of human West Nile virus
(WNV) infections in North America in 2002 compared with previous years,
with 4156 cases identified in the United States (USA), (including 284
deaths) (1) and 325 cases in Canada. (2) There were also further increases
in the known geographical spread of the virus both within and outside of
North America (3-6) and in the length of the transmission season. This
pattern seems likely to continue in 2003, with 715 human infections already
reported by Wed 20 Aug 2003 in the USA
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/surv&controlCaseCount03.htm>,
accessed 21 Aug 2003>.

The following novel modes of WNV transmission leading to human infection
were recognised in 2002: through percutaneous exposure to infected tissue
or serum (7); through transplanted organs or tissue (including blood) (8);
through breastfeeding (9); and via the transplacental route. (10)

Of these developments, the possibility of WNV being transmitted through
blood transfusion has generated most concern in Europe, since in the summer
months the potential donor 'pool' for many countries would likely include
individuals with a history of recent travel to endemic areas in North
America. A separate issue concerns the potential for indigenous
transmission of WNV within the European Union and associated countries.

Transmission of WNV Through Blood Transfusion
---------------------------------------------
Between 28 Aug 2002 and 1 Mar 2003, the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) in the USA received reports of 61 possible cases of WNV
infection associated with blood transfusions. Of these 61 cases, testing of
retained donor blood samples and epidemiological investigations
demonstrated that transfusion transmission was the likely source in 21
cases, with 14 implicated donors.

5 of the 14 [donors] gave no history of symptoms consistent with WNV
infection, indicating that asymptomatic individuals can sustain a level of
viraemia sufficient to cause onward transmission when the 'inoculation dose'
to the transfusion recipient (who may be more vulnerable to infection) is
large enough. The remaining 9 donors all reported symptoms consistent with
WNV infection. In some cases these symptoms preceded the donation of blood,
but in others they occurred only after donation.

Detailed information on the clinical outcomes of all infected recipients is
unavailable, although from individual published reports the mortality rate
appears to have been high. The WNV associated with the outbreak in North
America is the more virulent of the 2 lineages. In addition the mortality
rate is likely to reflect underlying pathology in the recipients and a high
'inoculation dose' of virus could be a factor.

Prevention of Transfusion Associated Infections
-----------------------------------------------
More than one approach is available to protect the public from transfusion-
associated infections, including the exclusion of potential donors at risk,
screening of donated blood for the presence of infectious agents, and the
treatment of donated blood products to destroy infectious agents. The
decision by any agency to adopt one or more of these approaches depends on
several factors, including the epidemiology of the infectious agent, an
assessment of its likely prevalence in the donor population, the
availability and cost of relevant technology to screen and treat blood
products, and the impact the policy will have on available blood stocks.

The different approaches taken by the USA and by European countries towards
protecting populations from transfusion-associated WNV infection reflect
these considerations.

The US Policy
-------------
Current policy in the USA is to screen all donated blood for the presence of
WNV. As donors are only potentially infective during the early viraemic
phase before antibodies can be detected, this has only become possible
since Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT) became available on 1 Jul 2003. WNV
detection by NAT is available from 3 commercial sources (Gen Probe, NGI,
and Roche) with sensitivities between 6.3-8.2 copies RNA/ml and high level
specificities when checked against samples from areas of high and low
endemicity. The USA has reported detection of a viraemic blood donor.

Policies across Europe
----------------------
In early summer 2003, the United Kingdom Blood Transfusion Services issued
a position statement on the prevention of transfusion associated WNV
infection, which stated that 'as travel to the USA and Canada is common in
UK blood donors, it is recommended that a deferral policy should be
introduced as a precautionary measure' (Table 1).

Table 1: Recommended deferral criteria for prevention of transfusion
associated WNV infection in the UK

Potential donor 'category' / Deferral policy:

Donors who have visited a WNV risk area* during the risk period** /
Defer for 28 days from date of leaving the affected area.

Donors who have visited a risk area* during the risk period** and have a
history of WNV or suspected WNV or fever with headache whilst there or
following return to the UK / Defer for 28 days from onset of symptoms

* A WNV risk area is defined as any part of the USA or Canada
** Between 1 Jun and 30 Nov (based on pattern of infections in 2002)

Post-donation illness in the donor and post-donation infection in the
recipient are routinely reported in the UK, resulting in appropriate
investigation and the recall of components. The potential impact of this
policy on blood stocks is not known: records of travel to North America
have not previously been kept. If significant losses of donations occur,
the UK Blood Transfusion Service will consider the introduction of
screening. The risk of WNV infection from imported plasma and other blood
products is considered to be minimal, because routine treatment inactivates
the virus and the USA and Canada have adopted a screening policy.

Other European countries for which information could be obtained are all
considering -- or have already adopted -- a prevention policy based on
exclusion of donors with a history of travel to North America (Table 2).
For most, this consists of an embargo on donation for 28 days after travel
or the onset of symptoms similar to that in the UK. Several countries
initially adopted a more focused deferral policy, with exclusion based on
travel to specified areas of North America where human cases have been
reported. This approach is potentially problematic, since each year there
has been an expansion in the geographical spread of human WNV infection in
a manner difficult to predict. In addition, reports from North America in
2003 after the introduction of screening have described the detection of
WNV in donor blood (in asymptomatic individuals) before the first reports
of clinical illness in a given area. As a result, countries that adopted
this approach have been reviewing their policies.

Table 2: Current policy position of selected European countries on
prevention of transfusion-associated West Nile virus infection.

Country / Deferral Policy:

Belgium / No deferral policy at present
Czech Republic / No deferral policy at present
Estonia / No deferral policy at present
France / Deferral for 28 days after travel to the US and Canada
Germany / Deferral policy under consideration at present
Netherlands / Deferral for travellers to areas in the US and Canada where
human cases reported
Ireland / Deferral for 28 days after travel to the US and Canada, or for
28 days after onset of symptoms of WNV.
Italy / No deferral policy at present
Latvia / Deferral policy under consideration at present
Malta / Deferral for 28 days after travel to the US and Canada, or for 28
days after onset of symptoms of WNV
Norway / Deferral for 28 days after travel to the US
Portugal / Deferral policy under consideration at present
Spain / No deferral policy at present
Sweden / Deferral policy under consideration at present
Switzerland / Deferral for 28 days after travel to the US and Canada, 28
days after onset of symptoms of WNV, and 14 days after recovery from illness
United Kingdom / Deferral for 28 days after travel to the US and Canada,
or for 28 days after onset of symptoms

The impact on most European countries of a policy deferring blood donation
in visitors to North America is difficult to estimate, although useful
statistics are available on the number of arrivals of non-resident tourists
at national borders (Table 3). It has however been estimated in Ireland
that approximately 10 percent of all Irish donors will travel to the USA or
Canada in any given summer.

Estonia* / 6745
France / 1 505 587

Portugal / 107 033
Spain / 405 177

Policies may need to be revised if the distribution of WNV continues to
expand, resulting in reports of human infection in Central and South
America. There is also a small risk from indigenous transmission of WNV
within the European Region and associated countries that may increase with
factors such as global warming and importation of vectors. Establishing and
maintaining appropriate surveillance in at risk countries will be key in
informing these considerations.
