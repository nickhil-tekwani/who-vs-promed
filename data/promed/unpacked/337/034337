Barbary Macaque in Toronto Zoo Succumbs to West Nile Virus Infection
--------------------------------------------------------------------
TORONTO: Officials at the Toronto Zoo are looking into expanding their
animal vaccination program after a monkey died as a result of West Nile
virus infection. Amos, a Barbary macaque, was put to sleep in August 2002
after becoming very ill. The results of an autopsy were only released Fri
22 Nov 2002.

Since it first surfaced in North America three years ago, West Nile virus
has been detected in about 230 species, including horses, birds, reindeer,
and even alligators. But zoo officials say this may be the first North
American case of the virus showing up in a non-human primate. At 25, Amos
is thought to have been one of the oldest Barbary macaques in the world.
Scientists say that, just as with humans, his age made him more susceptible
to the disease.

"On the whole, the picture of West Nile is like it is in people," said Dr.
Ian Barker, a professor at the Ontario Veterinary College in Guelph. "It is
only the rare individual that gets infected, and only the rare individual
who dies." Still, zoo officials aren't taking any chances. They've
previously vaccinated birds, zebras and rhinos. Now, the vaccination
program may be extended to cover all 5000 animals at the zoo.

[Dale Reddick has added the following commentary: " This CBC report
indicates what appears to be the first non-experimental mortality of a
non-human primate in the Western Hemisphere due to West Nile virus. The
species involved is the Barbary macaque (_Macaca sylvanus_), a close
relative to the rhesus macaque (_Macaca mulatta_), which is a principal
subject of biomedical research. It may be advisable to have captive
populations of NHPs vaccinated against West Nile virus, given what has now
been found in Toronto." - Mod.CP]
