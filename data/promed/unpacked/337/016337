[The death toll continues to climb from 293 reported on 16 Sep 2009 to the
356 reported currently in the Gorakhpur area of Uttar Pradesh. Previous
reports (see archives, below) have attributed some of the cases to Japanese
encephalitis virus (JEV) infection and others to an acute encephalitis
syndrome of unidentified etiology not caused by JEV. It is not clear what
the etiology of the cases is in this current report.
