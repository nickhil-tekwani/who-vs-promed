Here we go again; see below. Shooting dogs, whether in response to rabies or any other disease, is the surest possible way to ensure that the homeless dogs of the locale become furtive, evasive, primarily nocturnal, and very difficult to catch for vaccination, other treatment, or euthanasia by any approved humane method. Quite a few dogs never overcome their fear of any loud report.

Previous comments by Merritt in ProMED-mail archive no 20120229.1056792: Shooting dogs in response to rabies has been done for decades, and is still often done, but you would have a very hard time finding any instance anywhere in the world where shooting dogs ever verifiably stopped a rabies outbreak.

And here's why: Fire one shot, and most dogs within hearing distance (which is often several miles for dogs) take cover. The only dogs remaining in view are either the tamest (and therefore most likely to be vaccinated) or those who are significantly distracted by, for example, a female in heat.

Keep on shooting at any visible dogs and what you soon get is a very furtive nocturnal population who will evade vaccination efforts and continue to carry rabies for decades, as on Flores, in Indonesia.

There are several instances where shooting dogs is commonly said to have helped, but looking at the actual histories of the outbreaks tells a different story. Only saturation vaccination of the dog population ever really accomplishes anything against rabies.

See Merritt Clifton, 2011: "How to eradicate canine rabies: A perspective of historical efforts;" Asian Biomedicine 2011; 5(4): 559-68 for a wealth of historical detail (http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/animalwelfare/August_2011_Asian_Biomed_article.pdf)

[(And as before) Merritt is of course absolutely correct. Shooting stray dogs is not usually cost effective in controlling canine rabies. I do know of one instance, though, when it was successful, in Belize when it was done by SAS sharp-shooters after an adopted stray kitten came down with rabies in the soldiers' mess. I encourage our members to read his paper, which includes a description of the very effective vaccination programmes in Brasil using a tissue culture vaccine. They very quickly and cheaply reduced urban rabies to be essentially a non-event. And today, with GPS and Google Earth, it could be even better.

In the 1970s the programme deployed teams of 4 men each -- a driver and 3 vaccinators -- who went door to door looking for dogs, vaccinating them, and (I think) the vaccinated dogs got a distinctive but cheap collar. This was so that when the team came back 2-3 weeks later they could look for missed dogs and recruit children to find dogs not wearing the collar and, therefore, "unvaccinated." The timing was at the end of the whelping season when pups were old enough to be vaccinated but were still with their mothers, that is, not dispersed. The majority of the vaccinators were otherwise unemployed individuals who had been given adequate training to do the job safely and hygienically. And it worked very well (and cheaply).

And thanks again to Merritt for his wise correction, and my apologies. - Mod.MHJ
