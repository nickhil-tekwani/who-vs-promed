Maryland investigators are struggling to explain what killed 20,000 fish
found floating on a four-mile stretch of the Patapsco River last week, the
state's largest fish kill since the toxic microbe _Pfiesteria piscicida_
burst forth on the lower Eastern Shore two summers ago. Biologists with the
Maryland Department of the Environment have been cited as ruling out
pfiesteria as the cause of the kill, which occurred inside Patapsco Valley
State Park, between Howard and Baltimore counties. The dead fish-- which
included hog suckers, sunfish, carp and spot-tailed shiners-- were not
marred by the lesions considered indicators of the microbe. Water
temperatures were far below those believed to nurture pfiesteria outbreaks.
Quentin Banks, a spokesman for the Department of the Environment, said that
water samples collected at the kill provide no clues about the cause,
leaving investigators searching upriver for potential sources of toxin,
adding, "Something acutely toxic was dumped into that water. We don't know
whether it was from a company or somebody was dumping a chemical, but
something foreign went into the river."
The free-flowing river had already washed away any clues of what inflicted
the kill. By the next morning, fish had returned to the area where the kill
occurred, the live fish hovering above the dead. Banks said that scientists
took this as a sign that a quick pulse of toxin, and not a chronic
water-quality problem, caused the damage.
The only clue from the site is a whiff of chlorine reported by a Department
of Natural Resources police officer who first surveyed the scene. Chlorine
is highly toxic to fish and life in general. According to Banks, a single
bottle of household bleach spilled into the river would have been enough to
do the job. Kalinowski was quoted as saying, "Any time you have a fish kill
in an apparently healthy section of a waterway, it's a concern. This is a
significant kill."
