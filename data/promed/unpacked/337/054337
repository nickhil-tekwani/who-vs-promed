The consumption of toxic compounds with improperly prepared cassava
with high cyanogenic potential has caused disastrous consequences in
some regions of Cameroon and the Central African Republic, provoking
an outbreak of Konzo, a new disease that causes paralysis of both legs.

The French-based humanitarian NGO, Medicins Sans Frontires and the
United Nations Children Emergency Fund (UNICEF) reported the disease
in August last year [2008] in the East and Adamawa regions of Cameroon.

Health experts and researchers say Konzo occurs abruptly within
minutes or hours in previously healthy persons whose diets consist
almost exclusively of foods from roots of bitter cassava which have
not been properly processed. General symptoms of the disease include
deafness, blindness, aggravated goiter, partial or total paralysis of
arms and cranial nerves, and acute cyanide intoxication, which
appears 4-6 hours after consumption and consists of vomiting,
collapse and, in some cases, death.

In order to overcome the outbreak of the disease in Cameroon and the
Central African Republic, the International Institute of Tropical
Agriculture (IITA) took the initiative to organize a meeting of
stakeholders at IITA-Nkolbisson last Tues 3 Mar 2009 to identify
strategic preventive measures and approaches to eliminate the
disease. Experts drawn from health and research institutions,
international NGOs, UN agencies and universities, including
representatives of partner organizations (IITA, IRAD, FAO, CRS,
PNDRT, MINADER, MINSANTE, MINRESI, UNICEF, CODAS Bertoua, SARB
Batouri, Universities of Buea, Ngaoundre and Yaound 1) brainstormed
and identified strategic preventive measures and approaches to
eliminate Konzo as well as build potential partnerships. In effect,
the meeting brought up a multi-faceted proposal including a baseline
survey and sensitization campaign, introduction of improved cassava
varieties with low cyanogenic potential, reduction in malnutrition,
and empowerment of local communities in post harvest processing
options and capacity building.

[Konzo is an epidemic paralytic disease. Outbreaks are associated
with several weeks of almost exclusive consumption of insufficiently
processed bitter cassava
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassava>. Often, women and children
are more prominently seen as being affected and generally more often
in remote rural areas of East and Central Africa. Konzo translates as
"bound legs." The sudden onset of paralysis (hypertonic paraparesis)
is symmetrical and permanent, but does not progress. The onset is
reported to occur within minutes to a few hours at some point
following a diet that is high in cyanide from improperly prepared
cassava. The cyanide is released from the glucosides. Normally, the
cyanide-glucosides are bound and are removed by the processing of the
cassava root. When the processing is incomplete or not done at all,
the cyanide can be released. During food shortages, war and other
severe disruptions of life in poor rural cassava-growing communities,
the population has to make shortcuts in normal processing. A number
of epidemiological studies implicate the combination of high cyanide
intake and simultaneous low intake of sulfur amino acids needed to
detoxify cyanide as the main etiological factor. Familial clustering
is observed. Epidemics typically occur in the dry season in
households living in absolute poverty that have sustained themselves
for weeks or months on bitter cassava. It is noteworthy that not one
single case of any similar type of upper motor neuron damage has been
reported from cyanide exposure without simultaneous protein
malnutrition and, even more, that no case of Konzo has yet been
reported from poor cassava eating populations in South America.

There are varieties of cassava root that do not contain the cyanide
compound. Generally, the argument for using the cyanide containing
plant is its resistance to insects, which is apparently lacking in
the varieties without cyanide.

Konzo begins abruptly, without any warning or prodromal signs. The
initial symptoms are described as tremor, cramps, a heavy feeling
and/or weakness in the legs, a tendency to fall down and difficulty
remaining upright. There is a visible hypertonic gait when walking or
running. Occasionally, there will be lower back pain, blurred vision,
speech difficulties and/or paresthesia of the legs, but they
disappear within a month. During the 1st 2 days, the majority of
patients have general muscular weakness and are confined to bed.
Hypertonicity is present from day one. Flaccid paralysis of the limbs
does not occur. Later, there is a slight partial improvement.
Finally, the affected person develops a stable hypertonic
paraparesis, which persists for the remainder of life. Although the
patient is affected physically, there is no mental impairment, and
children should continue their education.

Unfortunately for the victims, there is no good treatment once the
limbs are affected. There may be some improvement with a varied diet.
Prevention is the best means of control of these outbreaks. A more
varied diet is imperative to prevent the symptoms.
