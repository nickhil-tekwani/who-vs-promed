Avian Influenza (AI) Central Infection Control Headquarters announced on [Mon 22 Nov 2021] that highly pathogenic avian influenza [HPAI] subtype H5N1 has been confirmed at a broiler farm in Eumseong, North Chungcheong Province. The farm, including about 92 000 broilers, is located within a 3km [about 1.9 mi] radius of the Eumseong quail farm, where HPAI was detected on [Mon 8 Nov 2021].

This is the 7th confirmed outbreak of HPAI in poultry this fall [2021], and the 4th negative case.

Separately, a suspected case of HPAI emerged on the same day [Mon 22 Nov 2021] at a meat duck farm in Damyang, Jeollanam-do. The farm raises about 10 000 ducks.

[South Korea's first HPAI outbreak this fall/winter season (2021) started, reportedly, on 8 Nov 2021, affecting a quail farm in Eumseong, North Chungcheong Province. The causative pathogen was identified on 10 Nov 2021 as HPAI H5N1 and notified to the OIE. ProMED published the notification (20211116.8699695). Mod CRD's commentary indicated that between 9 and 11 Nov 2021, 2 new outbreaks of HPAI H5N1 were identified in duck farms. One, located on a farm in Gyosan-ri, Naju, Jeollanam-do (South Jeolla Province); the other one located on a farm in Bondae ri, Eumseong, Chungcheongbuk-do (North Chungcheong Province). (OIE's follow-up No 1 is available at https://wahis.oie.int/#/report-info?reportId=42594).

S Korea's most recent (7th) confirmed HPAI outbreak is situated close to the first outbreak.

Since 2004, when HPAI was reported for the 1st time in S Korea, 3 serotypes of the virus have been reported from the country, mainly during the winter seasons: H5N1, H5N6, and H5N8. The most devastating epizootic was caused during the winter season of 2016-2017, by the H5N6 subtype, co-circulating with H5N8; the latter caused fewer outbreaks.

The current season's epizootic started earlier than last year's (2020).

Some media sources have recently referred to recent H5N8 outbreaks in S Korea; we have, so far, not been able to get this confirmed. - Mod.AS
