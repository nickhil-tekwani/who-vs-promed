A 2nd elephant has died from elephant herpes at Zurich Zoo, staff there said on Monday [11 Jul 2022], less than 2 weeks after the same virus claimed her brother.

Omysha, an 8-year-old Asian elephant, died on Sunday night [10 Jul 2022] despite receiving anti-viral drugs and blood plasma infusions, zoo spokesperson Pascal Marty said.

Omysha's sister Chandra and mother Indi were given time to say goodbye to her, an important consideration in animals with strong social ties, he added.

2-year-old brother Umesh died from the same virus at the end of June [2022].

"It's very sad that Omysha has died. Our staff did everything we could for her, but unfortunately, they weren't able to save her," Marty said.

"It's a very emotional time -- the staff live and work with the animals, see the births and deaths, and they really get to know them."

Nearly all elephants carry the elephant herpes virus latently, which means they do not show any symptoms and it cannot be detected in tests.

The disease particularly affects young elephants, whose immune system is not mature enough to produce antibodies to fight it.

Pathologists have begun examining Omysha to better understand the virus and develop better treatment methods, the zoo said.

The zoo said there were no other acute cases of herpes in its 6 other elephants, though staff were keeping a close eye on the youngest, a 5-year-old called Ruwani.

[Elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus 1A is a member of the _Proboscivirus_ genus and is a major cause of fatal hemorrhagic disease in endangered juvenile Asian elephants worldwide.

This virus causes fatal hemorrhagic disease commonly identified at zoos. The virus causes only benign external herpetic lesions in African elephants, but in Asian elephants the infection results in endothelial disease, which in many cases can be fatal.

Asian elephant deaths are the consequence of cross-species infection with a herpesvirus that is naturally latent in, but normally not lethal to, African elephants. - Mod.PMB]
