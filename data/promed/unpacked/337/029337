A chickenpox outbreak at a private school now ranks as North Carolina's largest since a vaccine for the virus became available more than 20 years ago, health officials say. As of Fri 16 Nov 2018, 36 students at Asheville Waldorf School had contracted the varicella virus, known to most as chickenpox. The school has one of the highest vaccination religious exemption rates in the state.

"People don't think it's a serious disease, and for the majority of people it's not. But it's not that way for everybody," Mullendore said. Two to 3 out of every 1000 children infected with chickenpox required care in a hospital, she said.

Each year, the chickenpox vaccine prevents more than 3.5 million cases of varicella, 9000 hospitalizations and 100 deaths, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states on its webpage. That's why health care providers for years have recommended all children medically able, namely those who have healthy immune systems, be vaccinated, Mullendore said.

Those recommendations have, by and large, gone unheeded by the parents of Asheville Waldorf's 152 students, 110 of whom have not received the chickenpox vaccine, which was made available in the United States in 1995.

North Carolina's Department of Health and Human Services tracks the rate of kindergarten attenders whose parents have claimed a religious exemption, allowing them to forego vaccination. During the 2017-2018 school year, the last for which data were available, Asheville Waldorf had a higher rate of religious exemptions for vaccination than all but 2 other schools in the state. Of the 28 kindergarten attenders who enrolled that year, 19 had an exemption to at least one vaccination required by the state for school entry.

School officials responded to questions from the Citizen Times on Fri 16 Nov 2018. The school enrols students from nursery age through 6th grade, Mullendore said.

The only 2 North Carolina schools to top Asheville Waldorf's religious exemption rate were private schools in other counties. Both had 100 per cent exemption rates; one had only one kindergarten student, the other had 2. During the same academic year, Buncombe County led the state in religious exemption rates for kindergartners with 5.7 per cent.

"The thing people need to understand is that when you have pockets of unvaccinated people, they serve as reservoirs for disease," said Susan Sullivan, a nurse with the state DHHS who consults with local health departments about vaccines and preventable diseases.

Buncombe County has long dealt with high vaccination exemption rates, in part from parents who fear vaccines more than the illnesses they prevent.
