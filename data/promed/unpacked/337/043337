"Newcastle disease virus [NDV] is a human pathogen and the most common sign of infection in humans is conjunctivitis that develops within 24 hours of NDV exposure to the eye. Reported infections have been non-life threatening and usually not debilitating for more than a day or 2. The most frequently reported and best substantiated clinical signs in human infections have been eye infections, usually consisting of unilateral or bilateral reddening, excessive lachrymation, oedema of the eyelids, conjunctivitis and sub-conjunctival haemorrhage. Although the effect on the eye may be quite severe, infections are usually transient and the cornea is not affected. There is no evidence of human-to-human spread. There is one report of the isolation of a pigeonlike APMV-1 from lung tissue, urine and faeces of an immunocompromised patient who died of pneumonia."
