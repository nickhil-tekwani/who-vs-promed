Across the United States, COVID-19 cases rose slightly this past week, while deaths and hospitalizations continued to drop.

Yesterday [Sun 13 Jun 2021] the country recorded 4574 new COVID-19 cases and 105 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker. In total the country has confirmed 33 469 661 cases and 599 924 deaths. This week, milestone 600 000 deaths will likely be met. [https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/cumulative-cases]

New daily COVID-19 cases rose by 1.3% in the past week, according to the Washington Post, with new daily deaths falling by 21.8% and COVID-related hospitalizations falling by 10.6%. Among reported tests, the positivity rate was 2%. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/coronavirus-us-cases-deaths/?itid=lk_inline_manual_11]

States note increases, but report less often
--------------------------------------------
At least 8 states are recording rising 7-day averages for infection rates over the past 2 weeks, including Alabama, Arkansas, Hawaii, Missouri, Nevada, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming. Of those states, only Hawaii has a vaccination rate of 43% or more, which matches the average across the country.

The slight increase in virus activity comes as most states are reopening fully, and many states are now choosing to report new cases less frequently than they did 1 year ago.

At least 24 states have scaled back how often they report COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, NPR reports. Some states have stopped reporting data over the weekends, while Florida and Oklahoma are reporting data only once a week. Public health experts worry that cutting back on daily reporting could leave states in the dark about new outbreaks. [https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/06/11/1004751742/states-scale-back-pandemic-reporting-stirring-alarm]

In related news, governors across the country are debating how and when to drop emergency power declarations that have been in place for more than a year. According to the Associated Press, emergency orders are set to expire before 4 Jul in roughly half of states. [https://apnews.com/article/government-and-politics-joe-biden-coronavirus-pandemic-health-1ecc111678cba61d78b7017e749e66c2]

Currently 6 states have seen emergency orders expire. Republican governors have voiced their support for letting emergency declarations end as cases drops, but democratic leaders say COVID-19 variants and wavering vaccination rates are reasons to keep such orders in place.

Americans comfortable in restaurants, workplaces
---------------------------------------
Summer is almost here, and most Americans plan to return to normal, pre-pandemic activities.

A new CBS News/YouGov poll shows that more than 70% of Americans are comfortable going into the workplace, eating at restaurants, and gathering with friends. But the poll also shows that non-vaccinated people are just as comfortable doing these things as vaccinated people. [https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-vaccine-businesses-reopening-opinion-poll/]

Half of all Americans said they were comfortable getting on an airplane, and 45% said they would attend a large event, an increase of 17 and 18% points, respectively, compared with 3 months ago. Americans who have said they will not get vaccinated are more comfortable with going to large social events, bars, and restaurants than those who are fully vaccinated.

The nation is split on vaccine mandates, with 56% saying they should be allowed for employers, compared with 44% who say they should not be allowed.

Minority vaccination rates differ
---------------------------------
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID Data Tracker shows 374 398 105 COVID-19 vaccine doses have been delivered in the United States and 309 322 545 have been administered, with 143 921 222 Americans fully vaccinated. [https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations]

Across the country, states are making every effort to meet President Joe Biden's [4 Jul 2021] goal of having 70% of adults with at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose, but new analysis from Kaiser Health News shows that Black and Hispanic Americans will not meet that goal and are lagging behind white and Asian Americans when it comes to vaccination rates.

The analysis, which included Americans ages 12 and up (Biden's goal is for 18 and up), shows that at the current pace of vaccination, by [4 Jul 2021] Asian people are the only group estimated to exceed a 70% vaccination rate. White people (66%) and Hispanic people (63%) will just meet the goal, and only about half (51%) of Black people will have received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose.

The analysis projects that it will be the end of [July 2021] before 70% of Hispanics have at least 1 dose, and by [September 2021], Black Americans will still have not met that goal. White Americans should meet the 70% goal by [2 Aug 2021].

International medical graduate physicians, or IMG physicians, make up about 25% of the practicing physicians in the United States, but they have made up 45% of COVID-related physician deaths, according to a JAMA Network Open research letter late last week. After stratifying data by state, however, only New York showed a significant difference between the proportion of international and US medical graduate (USMG) physician deaths.

The researchers used investigations conducted by MedPage Today, MedScape, and a collaboration between The Guardian and Kaiser Health News to identify COVID-related physician deaths through [23 Nov 2020]. Data showed 132 deaths in 28 states. IMG physicians made up 59 of these deaths (44.7%), 1.80 times higher than the national average (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.51 to 2.21). New York, New Jersey, and Florida accounted for 66.1% of IMG physician deaths but only 45.2% of USMG physician deaths.

Overall, the researchers note that all states except New York had statistically insignificant differences between their proportion of IMG versus USMG physician deaths. "However, the authors add, "67% (89 of 132) of physician deaths occurred in states where the proportion of practicing IMG physicians is greater than the national proportion of 25%."

Almost 60% of deceased physicians were in primary care (59.8%), which is 1.62 times higher than the national average of primary care physicians (95% CI, 1.39 to 1.84), the researchers write. Additionally, 38 deceased primary care physicians were IMGs, which is 2.9 times higher than the proportion of primary care IMG physicians in the country (95% CI, 2.13 to 3.65). USMG physicians in primary care, on the other hand, saw statistically insignificant COVID death rates compared with their proportion in the workforce (risk ratio, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.48).

"A possible reason for [these results] is the observation that the majority of physician deaths occurred in states with relatively larger proportions of IMGs, which were also the states with higher incidence of COVID-19 at the onset of the pandemic," write the researchers. "It is also possible that IMGs in a few states (eg. New York) had higher exposure to COVID-19 because of their practice settings; 40% of IMGs work in primary care. These findings mirror a report from the UK on the high proportion of immigrants among 18 physicians who died of COVID-19."

[The header of the report is a little misleading, since the authors state that while overall mortality rates are higher for international medical graduate physicians, when stratified by state, only New York showed a significant difference between the proportion of international and US medical graduate physician deaths.

Furthermore, they warn that "no definitive or causal conclusions can be reached because of the small numbers, the observational nature of the data set, and the possibility of infections contracted outside clinical practice." - Mod.LK]

Healthcare providers should wear N95 respirators when COVID-19 rates are high in the community, not just if they're dealing directly with COVID-19 patients, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The commentary, published in Clinical Infectious Diseases late last week, outlines 3 reasons. 1st, the Harvard University researchers point to evidence that patients are most contagious just before and immediately following symptom onset as well as studies that show that asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic people account for the most secondary transmissions. If unsuspected patients are still incubating or acquire COVID-19 infection after healthcare admittance, the researchers write, they might more easily spread the disease since their contagiousness will peak while in the healthcare setting.

2nd, patients with known or suspected COVID-19 are often treated in settings with stricter safety protocols (e.g., negatively pressurized, ventilated rooms), and healthcare workers tend to better adhere to personal protective equipment (PPE) guidelines. The researchers write, however, that providers are generally more lax when they assume their patients are not infected with COVID-19, putting them at increased risk for infection.

And 3rd, compared with medical masks or less protective respirators, N95s would better prevent healthcare providers from transmitting the virus from infected COVID-19 patients to non-infected patients, according to the authors.

"If N95s are appropriate to protect healthcare workers seeing patients with confirmed Covid-19, then it follows that they are also appropriate to protect healthcare workers seeing asymptomatic patients in outpatient and inpatient settings when the incidence of Covid-19 is high," the researchers write. They add that vaccinating healthcare workers and patients is "ultimately the most powerful way to reduce the risk of transmission."

Abstract
"CDC now recommends N95 respirators for all providers seeing patients with possible or confirmed Covid-19. We suggest, however, that N95s may be just as important for the care of patients without suspected Covid-19 when community incidence rates are high. This is because SARS-CoV-2 is most contagious before symptom onset. Ironically, by the time patients are sick enough to be admitted to hospital with Covid-19 they tend to be less contagious. The greatest threat of transmission in healthcare facilities may, therefore, be patients and healthcare workers with early occult infection. N95s' superior fit and filtration provide superior exposure protection for healthcare providers seeing patients with early undiagnosed infection and superior source control to protect patients from healthcare workers with early undiagnosed infection. The probability of occult infection in patients and healthcare workers is greatest when community incidence rates are high. Universal use of N95s may help decrease nosocomial transmission at such times." - Mod.LK]

SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels were significantly higher in symptomatic than asymptomatic patients, but there were no significant differences in children versus adults, according to a study in JAMA Pediatrics late last week.

The researchers looked at positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction results from 123 children and 432 adults in King County, Washington 23 Mar - 9 Nov 2020. Most were healthy; seasonal allergies (7.3%) were the most frequent health condition, followed by asthma (4.1%). Of the children, 40.7% were younger than 5 years, 36.6% were between ages 5 and 11, and 22.8% were 12-17. The researchers add that, in this convenience-based sample, children had fewer and shorter symptoms than adults (average, 1.6 vs 4.5 symptoms; 3.8 vs 4.9 days, respectively). They were also more likely to be asymptomatic (38.2% vs 7.2%).

The team used cycle threshold (Ct) values as a proxy for viral load; the lower the Ct value, the higher the viral RNA load. After adjusting for swab type, the average Ct values for symptomatic versus asymptomatic patients showed no statistical significance when stratified by age. Overall, symptomatic individuals had lower Ct values than asymptomatic ones (adjusted for children, -3.0; 95% CI, -5.5 to -0.6; P = 0.02; versus adults, -2.9; 95% CI, -2.2 to 0.9; P = 0.01).

An editorial by Rostad CA et al. contextualize the findings within discussions of in-person schooling. They say the study "underscores the potential transmission risk of symptomatic children and the importance of isolating while symptomatic," and add: "Extracurricular activities are important in SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and measures to prevent transmission should be used."

The editorial authors advocate for COVID-19 vaccination of children, educators, and school staff, as well as multi-layered mitigation strategies to prevent transmission.

"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has impacted the medical, economic, social, and political landscape worldwide. Despite public health measures to contain the virus, including masks, hand hygiene, school closures, and stay-at-home orders, COVID-19 was the 3rd leading cause of death in the US in 2020. Although early data suggested that children accounted for only 2% of COVID-19 cases1, more recent reports have indicated that 13% of diagnosed cases in the US have occurred in children. Additionally, the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations among children is similar to that observed in a typical influenza season, and COVID-19 deaths in children exceed the total observed in any single influenza season.2,3

"In March 2020, in an attempt to curb the exponential growth of the COVID-19 pandemic, kindergarten through 12th-grade schools closed in all 50 US states, affecting 57 million students.4 The effects of these school closures have been far reaching, including marked social disruption and psychological and educational impact.

"Nevertheless, the resumption of in-person learning has proven controversial, as officials and communities weigh the risks of potential transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in schools against the benefits of in-person learning.

"To adequately assess these risks, it is important to address 3 key questions: (1) What is the role of children in community transmission of infectious pathogens? (2) What is the role of children specifically in SARS-CoV-2 transmission? and (3) What can be done to get children safely back in daycare, preschool, and school?

"Finally, to get back to something resembling the normal life of 2019, vaccination of children is needed. As has been observed for other pathogens, local vaccine hesitancy can result in sustained transmission of vaccine-preventable infections.5 Without vaccination, children will continue to serve as a reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 infections, experiencing preventable morbidity and delaying the development of herd immunity.17

"The Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine has received emergency use authorization by the US Federal Drug Administration (FDA) for administration to adults and adolescents 12 years and older, and Moderna has released data demonstrating the safety and efficacy of its vaccine (mRNA-1273) for adolescents 12 years and older. Clinical trials are also underway to assess the safety and immunogenicity of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 for children 6 months and older (NCT04816643 and NCT04796896, respectively). Expanding vaccine eligibility for children and addressing vaccine hesitancy will provide greater opportunities to layer protection and reduce transmission risk in schools. Additionally, encouraging uptake of vaccines among educators and school staff is critical to reducing their risk of occupational acquisition (e.g., from children or other staff) and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to others.

"As in-school transmission events parallel community transmission, we must all remain vigilant in our commitment to public health prevention strategies, flexible in our approach to an evolving virus, and resilient in our efforts to safely provide the best learning opportunities for our children." - Mod.LK]

[5] Vaccines: Novavax
Date: Mon 14 Jun 2021
Source: CIDRAP [edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/06/novavax-covid-vaccine-90-effective-phase-3-trial


Novavax's 2-dose COVID-19 vaccine showed 90% overall vaccine efficacy (VE), 100% protection against moderate and severe illness, and 93% VE against variants of concern and of interest in a phase 3 US clinical trial in adults, according to a company news release today [14 Jun 2021].

Maryland-based Novavax plans to file for regulatory authorization for adults within the next few months, the release said. While authorization wouldn't likely have much effect on the already robust US vaccine supply, it could provide a badly needed boost to the international vaccine rollout. Another plus is that it doesn't require ultra-cold temperatures for shipping and storage.

The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a global group of government and funding groups, said on Twitter today [14 Jun 2021] that 1.1 billion doses of the Novavax vaccine are slated for COVAX, an initiative focused on providing equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines globally, with the remaining needed doses slated to be supplied through the Serum Institute of India.

The trial of NVX-CoV2373, a recombinant nanoparticle protein-based coronavirus vaccine, enrolled 29 960 participants 18 and older at 119 locations in the United States and Mexico beginning in August 2020. 77 people later tested positive for COVID-19, 63 in the placebo group and 14 among vaccinees. While 10 moderate and 4 severe coronavirus cases occurred in the placebo group, all cases in the vaccine group were mild.

In a group of particular interest -- those older than 65 years and younger people with certain underlying conditions or who work in high-risk occupations -- the Novavax vaccine had 91.0% VE (62 cases in the placebo group vs 14 in the vaccine group).

Genomic sequence data available for 54 of the 77 COVID-19 cases showed 93.2% efficacy against variants of concern or interest and 100% efficacy against less transmissible strains. Of cases caused by variants of concern, 38 occurred in the placebo group and 6 among vaccinees.

The release noted that the Alpha (B117) coronavirus variant was the dominant strain in the United States at the time of study end point accruals, 25 Jan - 30 Apr 2021, and that cases of other variants of concern and interest were also climbing.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, variants of concern are those with evidence of increased transmissibility, more severe illness, significant reduction in neutralizing antibody protection from infection or vaccination, lower effectiveness of therapies or vaccines, or COVID-19 test evasion. Variants of interest are those with genetic markers linked to changes in receptor binding, reduced antibody neutralization, or a predicted increase in spread or severity.

The vaccine was well tolerated in general, according to the release, with few serious and adverse events balanced between the 2 study groups. No one adverse event occurred in over 1% of participants. The most common local symptom in the 7 days after each dose was mild or moderate injection-site pain, while the most common systemic symptoms included fatigue, headache, and muscle pain, all of which resolved within 2 days.

The company recently completed enrollment of 2248 participants aged 12-17 years in the ongoing trial. The Novavax vaccine was recently shown in a UK phase 3 trial to have 96.4% VE against the original SARS-CoV-2 strain, 86.3% against the Alpha variant, and 89.7% overall.

It is also being tested in a phase 2b trial in South Africa, which found 55% efficacy overall in HIV-negative participants and 48.6% against the Beta (B1351) variant, and in a phase 1/2 study in the United States and Australia.

"Novavax continues to work with a sense of urgency to complete our regulatory submissions and deliver this vaccine, built on a well understood and proven platform, to a world that is still in great need of vaccines," Novavax President and Chief Executive Officer Stanley Erck said in the release.

The company intends to ramp up manufacturing to 100 million doses per month by the end of September 2021 and up to 150 million by the end of the year [2021], the release said.

If given emergency use authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration, the vaccine would join 3 other COVID-19 vaccines already available in the United States: Pfizer/BioNTech (overall phase 3 VE after 2 doses in adults, 95.0%), Moderna (94.1%), and Johnson & Johnson (72% as a 1-dose vaccine).

[Covid-19 vaccine candidate NVX-CoV2373 [Novavax] works differently than the other vaccines that have made it this far. It's a protein subunit vaccine, which means that it uses a lab-made version of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This spike protein alone can't make anyone sick. But to make sure that the body still generates the protective antibodies against it, Novavax has inserted an adjuvant, which acts as a hypeman for the immune system to signal it to spring into action.

Novavax's subunit vaccine approach is a tried and true method for generating effective vaccines. Modern flu vaccines, HPV vaccines, and HepB vaccines all use a similar approach. But because these vaccines have multiple components -- the spike protein and the adjuvant -- they typically take longer to make than other vaccine types. That makes it surprising that 20-year-old Novavax, which has never produced a vaccine that's reached the public before, made it to late-stage clinical trials so quickly.

According to Science Magazine (https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/11/will-small-long-shot-us-company-end-producing-best-coronavirus-vaccine), Novavax will need to rely mostly on manufacturing contracts to reach its vaccine distribution goals, but here too subunit vaccines offer an advantage. They only need to be refrigerated, not deep-frozen, and they can be made using existing equipment (in this case, bioreactors containing genetically-modified moth cells). These factors could make it easier to produce worldwide and suited to serving lower-income countries. Already, the Serum Institute of India has agreed to partner with Novavax to manufacture vaccines and help build additional plants to do so (excerpted from https://qz.com/1950365/what-is-the-novavax-vaccine-and-how-does-it-work/). - Mod.LK]
