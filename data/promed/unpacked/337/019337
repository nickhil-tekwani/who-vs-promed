[ProMED received the following correction to the earlier post
(Chikungunya - Indian Ocean update (30): spread to UK 20060913.2595)
from Dr. Phil Luton, Business Development & Communications, Health
Protection Agency, Centre for Emergency Preparedness and Response,
Porton Down, Salisbury]
Please accept this email as official notification that we have
identified an error in the number of cases that we reported in our
original press release, which you subsequently picked up from
Reuters, in respect of Chikungunya virus, and have posted.
The figure of over 115 cases as reported referred to the number of
samples that had been tested and this was the number presented in the
paper at our annual conference. It subsequently transpired that we
had received multiple samples from a number of patients and we have
therefore refined the number of cases down from 115 to 93.
In all other respects the press release is accurate, in that this is
a significant increase, and travellers should take appropriate
precautions to avoid being bitten. We have corrected the numbers on
the version of the press release posted on our website and wanted to
make you aware of the situation in case this leads to any confusion.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Luton for this timely information. The reduction
in the numbers of chikungunya cases imported into the UK does not
alter the importance of this observation, or the need to avoid
mosquito bites and remain vigilant to detect the possible presence of
the vector, _Aedes albopictus_, in the UK, which could provide
suitable conditions for its establishment.
