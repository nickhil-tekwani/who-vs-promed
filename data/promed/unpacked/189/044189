Thirteen people in Sweden have been infected by hepatitis A virus linked to frozen strawberries from Poland. Eleven confirmed and 2 suspected cases are reported from 4 Swedish counties, Skane, Blekinge, Kalmar and Gavleborg. Nine women and 4 men aged 11 to 92 are affected. The most recent person to fall ill had symptoms begin on 18 Jun 2018.

The Public Health Agency of Sweden (Folkhalsomyndigheten), the National Food Agency (Livsmedelsverket) and local authorities are involved in the investigation. They traced the source of hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection to frozen strawberries from Poland and informed Polish authorities of their findings.

All of the cases had smoothies or a dessert containing frozen imported strawberries that were not heated prior to consumption. The strawberries were not sold directly to consumers. Analysis of the current lot of strawberries from Poland showed they contain the same type of hepatitis A virus, genotype 1B, that has infected the victims. Livsmedelsverket told Food Safety News that patients ate strawberries in smoothies from a juice bar and unheated strawberries in a dessert in a nursing home.

Frozen strawberries have been sold by a company in Poland to a wholesaler in Sweden. The wholesaler sold them to various caterers and restaurants. A recall is underway, and official say the products might still be on the market.

Skogsmat i Uddeholm AB, a Swedish producer and supplier of berries, fruits, vegetables, mushrooms, pur√©es and juice concentrates, imported the strawberries from Poland. Menigo Foodservice AB, a food supplier based in Sweden and owned by Sysco, distributed them.

Livsmedelsverket said the distributor has not been fined or closed because it did what it was supposed to do given the circumstances. The agency added that extra checks of imported strawberries as a general action is not an option, as it would be a breach of rules concerning the free movement of goods and products in the EU internal market.

Two outbreaks of hepatitis A infection were noted in the 2nd quarter of this year [2018], according to international food safety statistics, the one referenced above and another linked to frozen pomegranate arils.

[Frozen berries have been implicated in hepatitis A transmission in the past. The exact mechanism of contamination is generally not clearly established, but hepatitis A is essentially only a human pathogen transmitted by the fecal-oral route. Transmission can be through food or water contamination or, as has been occurring in a number of large and some still ongoing outbreaks in the USA, through poor sanitation involving marginalized populations such as the homeless, with spill over into other groups. - Mod.LL
