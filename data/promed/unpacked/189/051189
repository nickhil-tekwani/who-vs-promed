South Africa: suspected case of human mad cow disease in Pretoria
----------------------------------------------
Pretoria's Military Hospital 1 is investigating the possibility that one of
its patients may have died from variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
[abbreviated as CJD (new var.) or vCJD in ProMED-mail], the human
equivalent of mad cow disease [bovine spongiform encephalopathy]. The
disease has not been previously diagnosed in South Africa. Hospital
spokesman Major Niko Allie confirmed yesterday, 10 May 2004, that the
hospital was conducting a full investigation following the death of a
female patient on Sat 8 May 2004. Brain tissue samples will be checked for
signs of the disease.

It was 1st suspected that the woman, whose name has not been released,
might have been suffering from the disease, when she showed symptoms of
brain and neurological deterioration similar to that suffered by CJD
patients. "The investigation will be thorough to establish if there is a
concern," Allie said.

[In the year 2000, the death of a comparatively young South African woman
in a Johannesburg hospital was initially attributed to vCJD. However, brain
biopsy material was consistent with a diagnosis of classical (sporadic)
CJD, and there were no features to confirm the preliminary diagnosis of
vCJD. It seems unlikely, in the present case, that the initial diagnosis of
vCJD will be sustained by laboratory examination. The age of the victim is
not stated in the report, and the basis for the diagnosis of vCJD is
unclear. Prolonged residence in the UK, or another European country where
BSE has been observed in cattle, might be the reason for considering a
diagnosis of vCJD. - Mod.CP]
