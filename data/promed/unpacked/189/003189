Officials at the state health department have confirmed that 10 people
from Beaver and Allegheny counties became sick after consuming milk
from a local dairy. Pennsylvania Department of Health spokeswoman
Brandi Hunter-Davenport said in an e-mail Thu 4 Apr 2011 that 5
individuals in Beaver County and 5 in Allegheny County [in western
Pennsylvania] were sickened by bacteria after drinking pasteurized,
glass-bottled milk from Brunton Dairy in Independence Township.

Since 15 Jun 2011, 5 males and 5 females, ranging from 1 to 75 years
old, developed diarrhea and symptoms caused by bacteria called
_Yersinia enterocolitica_. During an investigation by the state health
department and the state Department of Agriculture, which oversees
dairy production in Pennsylvania, the family-run farm has voluntarily
stopped producing milk using its on-site pasteurization facility.

Herb Brunton, a partner in the business, told The Times his family
first learned about a possible link to the illnesses on 27 Jul 2011,
when they were contacted by the health department. A statement written
by the family on the farm's website said it is cooperating fully with
the investigation "to ensure that, if any problem exists, it will be
quickly and effectively remedied."

"We undergo regular testing and inspections as required by law, and
all those tests have returned negative," the statement said.

Hunter-Davenport said by phone Thursday [4 Aug 2011] that health
officials are "looking to continue to receive updates and results
through the end of this week," but she had no word on how long the
ongoing investigation might take.

The dairy farm, which has been operated by the Brunton family since
1832, began bottling milk in 1964 and produces several different kinds
and flavors, including the acclaimed chocolate variety. The state
health department's consumer advisory for dairy products does not
extend to other goods sold by the farm, such as cheese, which is
produced elsewhere.

Many of the farm's products are available through a home delivery
service and at 31 retail outlets throughout Beaver, Allegheny, and
Butler counties and at one location in Lawrence County.

[The source of the contamination is unclear especially since the
pasteurization procedures have not been found to be deficient and no
source of contamination has been found at the dairy. As discussed in
the previous posting on this cluster, post-pasteurization
contamination is likely to be the mode of contamination. It has not
been stated whether one or most of the kinds or flavors of the milk
has been implicated.

That the milk is glass-bottled brings to mind a famous outbreak of
infection due to _Streptobacillus moniliformis_, an etiologic agent in
rat bite fever. This cluster of illness called Haverhill fever after
the Massachusetts town that hosted it, was also spread by bottled milk
that was home delivered, and the contamination may have occurred from
rodents in contact with the tops of the bottled milk while sitting
outside the homes of recipients. - Mod.LL]
