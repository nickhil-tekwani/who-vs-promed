Kosovo experienced infections with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic
fever (CCHF) virus in recent years. Have KFOR troups currently
stationed in Kosovo been informed of the health risks and have
they been prepared for this infection? The same applies to the
international police force. Is ribavirin available in the military
sanitary units? What if soldiers with suspected VHF are flown back
to their country of origin? Is timely diagnosis of CCHF feasible in all
places?
