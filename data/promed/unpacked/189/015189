Islanders have been suffering from a flu virus in late November /
early December [2007], with asthma sufferers particularly affected,
and as a result there is a concern that stocks of drugs are low.

The situation is under control and there is no emergency.
Nevertheless the Tristan Administrator, David Morley, is exploring
options for an extra supply of the appropriate drugs as a contingency
before the arrival of the next scheduled ship due on 23 Jan 2008. We
will publicise these arrangements here when they are known as the
Tristan community look forward to a happy and healthy Christmas 'far
from the madding crowd'.

The Tristan da Cunha Community is grateful to many friends who have
expressed concern and offered help following reports in the media on
Tue 4 Dec 2007, which wrongly indicated a critical situation.

A comment on rhinoviruses and asthma
--------------------------------------------------
The following is a comment on the Moderator's comment appended to
ProMED-mail "Undiagnosed respiratory illness - Tristan da Cunha: RFI
20071204.3916" about the mysterious respiratory illness affecting
islanders on Tristan da Cunha.

I think that today it is fairly safe to say the rhinoviruses [the
common cold viruses] have a very strong affiliation with expiratory
wheezing; at least exacerbations thereof, if not in a causal role.
The research of Sebastian Johnston and James Gern [see: J Virol. 2006
Aug; 80(16): 8248-58, available at
<http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/content/full/80/16/8248?maxtoshow=&HITS=10&hits=10&RESULTFORMAT=&fulltext=Sebastian+Johnston+and+James+Gern+&searchid=1&FIRSTINDEX=0&volume=80&issue=16&resourcetype=HWCIT>
for references - Mod.CP] has made some significant inroads into
linking symptoms with human rhinoviruses, more so among individuals
with a possible immune imbalance but perhaps also in "normal"
individuals who have just had a series of more severe clinical
outcomes from infection. In the young, bronchiolitis and asthma
predominate while asthma and COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease] exacerbations represent the related conditions in the
elderly, becoming more clearly linked to human rhinovirus detection.

[There is as yet no definitive identification of the 'flu' virus
affecting islanders on Tristan da Cunha, which has particularly
affected asthma sufferers. Dr Ian Mackay suggests that any of the
human rhinoviruses responsible for the common cold might affect
asthma sufferers more severely.

Presumably the drugs in short supply on the island are for the relief
of asthma and not specifically anti-viral agents. - Mod.CP]
