Viet Nam hub down with foot-and-mouth but not on epidemic scale
-----------------------------------------------
Ho Chi Minh City has been added to the list of provinces hit by
foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] in Viet Nam, but [authorities] said it
is unnecessary to announce an epidemic. The disease had earlier
infected about 4300 cattle and pigs in 9 provinces nationwide.
The city's Department of Animal Health Saturday [3 Feb 2007]
officially confirmed that infections were reported in Binh Chanh
district. It said that during the last 7 days of last month [January
2007], local authorities culled 1250 infected pigs that farmers had
bought from the central region where the disease is now holding sway.
The farmers had not reported the purchase to local animal health
authorities for proper examination and vaccination of the herd.
The city Steering Committee on FMD prevention and control has called
for owners in Binh Chanh district to kill their healthy cattle within
5 days unless they are able to sell them to registered slaughterhouses.
Huynh Huu Loi, head of the animal health department, said the disease
was on a small scale in the city and had been partly controlled, so
an announcement of the epidemic was not necessary.
The disease has been found in Cao Bang, Tuyen Quang, Lang Son, Yen
Bai, Thai Nguyen, Phu Tho provinces in the north; Can Tho City, HCMC,
Soc Trang, Dong Nai in the south; and Kon Tum province in the central
highlands, with 1394 cattle, 191 goats, and 2797 pigs infected.
FMD is a highly contagious viral disease affecting animals with
divided hooves, especially cattle, sheep, and pigs, in which the
animal develops ulcers in the mouth and near the hooves.

[According to the above information, 11 Vietnamese provinces are
currently infected.
We are grateful to Dr. Richard Rubira from the Disease Preparedness
and International Office of the Chief Veterinary Officer, Canberra,
Australia for bringing to our attention the FMD reports from the 8
member-countries of OIE's Southeast Asia (SEA) Regional Office, available at
<http://www.seafmd-rcu.oie.int/fmd_se_asia.php>.
Viet Nam's table-form report for the last updated month, namely
October 2006, is available at
<http://www.seafmd-rcu.oie.int/fmd_se_asia.php?reptype=table&state=VNM&month=10&year=2006>.
It appears that all outbreaks in Viet Nam during October 2006 were
caused by FMDV serotype O. The website includes maps showing the
location of all reported outbreaks. - Mod.AS]
