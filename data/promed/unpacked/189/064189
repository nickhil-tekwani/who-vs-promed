N.J. state prison inmate may have leprosy, officials awaiting biopsy
[results]
-----------------------------------------------
Authorities are awaiting biopsy results to determine whether a New
Jersey State Prison inmate in Trenton has leprosy. Officials isolated
the man and put him on antibiotics.
Leprosy is caused by bacteria that live in nasal passages and can be
transmitted by coughing and sneezing.
The Corrections Department expects to get the results of the biopsy
from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in a week to 10
days.

[Leprosy is also known as Hansen's disease, and is caused by infection with
the bacterium _Mycobacterium leprae_. - Mod.JW]
[I checked on this with my good colleague Richard Truman, Epidemiologist,
USPHS-Hansen's Disease Center <rtruma1@lsu.edu> (his office is just around
the corner from where mine was in the LSU Vet School). Apparently, they make
some 200 Hansen's disease (HD) diagnoses each year. Anything sent to CDC is
immediately forwarded to Baton Rouge. Of that "200," about 160 are
infections acquired abroad by incomers or US citizens traveling abroad or
expats returning home. Of the remainder, 6-8 are Louisianans and 32-34 or so
are Texans ... people living along the Gulf Coast. Where and how they
acquired their infections is unknown, and none of them report knowing
someone with the disease.
Interestingly, these Gulf Coast cases are genetically related to the _M.
leprae_ infections found in armadillos in the region and are not found
anywhere else in the world. In the affected region, some 30 percent of adult
armadillos are infected; outside, the infection is rare and essentially
limited to male armadillos adventuring out from the enzootic area.
Logically, human and armadillo _M. leprae_ infections in Mexico would be
expected to be genetically similar, but, unfortunately, Hansen's disease has
a very low priority in that country, and in Central America as well, and
there is a virtual total absence of biological samples to test.
The Gulf Coast human and armadillo organisms probably share a common
parentage; the 9-banded armadillo is notorious for burrowing and will do it
in graveyards (which is why they don't eat it in Brazil, they prefer the non-
digging 7-banded armadillo). It is presumed that armadillos got infected in
the past from scavenging around HD corpses. Evidence for an ongoing inter-
species transfer of infection is missing, although there are anecdotal
stories of Texan armadillo aficionados becoming infected, and cooked
armadillo is not unknown in Acadiana.
Many years ago, Richard's dissertation was on the development of an ELISA
test for _M. leprae_ infection, and for many years we successfully used this
as a vehicle for training epidemiology graduate students in wild animal
(armadillo) sampling, bleeding, tagging and release -- very straightforward
with a hand-net. Armadillos are a recent introduction in Louisiana; they
arrived in the mid-1950s with the building of interstate highways and
bridges. So the "home" of armadillo _M. leprae_ infection may well be in NE
Mexico, if anyone were to go looking for it. - Mod.MHJ]
