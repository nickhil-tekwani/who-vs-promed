3 people in the Erode district are suspected to have died of scrub typhus causing concern among villagers. The disease spreads from mice.

During December 2011, the incidence of the disease was high in Dharmapuri district and now it is prevalent in Erode district. Mice which enter farms to eat groundnuts and grains spread the disease.

"2 of the victims were from Nambiyur in Erode district and one was from Puliyampatti," said a source. Doctors of the Indian Medical Association are now trying to spread awareness about the disease and its treatment through an SMS campaign," the source added.

[The following is a previous moderation regarding scrub typhus by moderator ML and is excerpted from a report published by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Demma LJ, McQuiston JH, Nicholson WL, Murphy SM, Marumoto P, Sengebau-Kingzio JM, et al. Scrub typhus, Republic of Palau. Emerg Infect Dis [serial on the Internet]. 2006 Feb [date cited]. Available from http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol12no02/05-0967.htm):

"Scrub typhus is a zoonotic illness caused by _Orientia tsutsugamushi_. The pathogen is transmitted through the bite of larval mites (chiggers) of the _Trombiculidae_ family, which serve as both the vector and the reservoir (1,2). Rodents of the family _Muridae_ (rats and mice) are common hosts for trombiculid mites and may support _O. tsutsugamushi_. Geographically specific foci of scrub typhus are thus determined by the distribution of vector mites and their rodent hosts and by interactions of mites and rodents with humans (3). Scrub typhus has been reported from many regions of Asia and the Pacific islands, and known disease-endemic regions extend from Japan and eastern Russia southward to Australia and westward to Pakistan and Afghanistan (4,5).

"Scrub typhus is typically a nonspecific febrile illness; its severity may be influenced by the strain of _O. tsutsugamushi_, a person's immune status, and other factors. Diagnosis may be complicated in areas where the disease has not been documented recently or in regions lacking the capacity for laboratory confirmation. Illness develops after an incubation period of 6 to 21 days and usually begins with an eschar at the site of a chigger bite. Fever, headache [lymphadenopathy], and myalgias are common, and a maculopapular rash may also be present. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or lower respiratory symptoms can also occur. Manifestations such as pneumonitis, meningoencephalitis, jaundice, renal failure, and myocarditis can develop during the prolonged clinical course of untreated illness (6). Establishing the diagnosis and initiating prompt antimicrobial drug therapy are important, because death rates for untreated scrub typhus patients are 1-30 percent (5). Scrub typhus is effectively treated with doxycycline, and treatment should begin immediately upon suspicion of illness without awaiting laboratory confirmation."

Rodents serve as a reservoir, although transovarial transmission in mites is the dominant mechanism for maintenance of _O. tsutsugamushi_ (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol9no12/03-0212.htm). Humans become infected when they accidentally encroach in an area where the chigger-rodent cycle is occurring, most often areas of low-lying scrub brush or transitional vegetation. Patients with severe scrub typhus can develop multiorgan failure and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy with hemorrhage."
