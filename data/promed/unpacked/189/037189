In Sulzfeld (Rhoen-Grabfeld district), since January [2014], 12 people have been confirmed with Q-fever. According to the competent health authority, 25 more people are suspected to be suffering from Q-fever. Most cases are located in the centre of Sulzfeld.

Horst Rusche, head of the health department of the district of Rhoen-Grabfeld, told the "Bayerischer Rundfunk" that some of those affected are suffering from lung infections or pneumonia. Six patients had to be hospitalized. According to Rusche, the pathogen is believed to have been transmitted from sheep through dust in the air. In 5 sheep, the pathogen was confirmed. These sheep were disinfected [comment] and are now housed in a stable. The last case was registered on 28 Apr 2014. "Additional cases can not be ruled out," said Rusche.

According to the health department, the incubation in humans is usually 2 to 3 weeks. Those affected mostly suffer from fever, chills, muscle pain and severe headache. Rusche warned that Q fever infection of pregnant women in the 1st 3 months of pregnancy may lead, in many cases, to loss of the child. For people with heart valve disease, or a heart valve prosthesis, there is a risk that the Q fever infection will become chronic.

People can be infected by dust-borne Q fever pathogens from infected herds over a distance of up to 2 km. Direct transmission of Q-fever from person to person is, according to Rusche, a rare event.

The health department invites the people in Sulzfeld to an information meeting planned for 15 May 2014. The citizens will be offered a blood test.

[The report said that the 5 sheep in which the pathogen was confirmed "were disinfected and are now housed in a stable." However, no disinfection of live sheep is feasible.

According to compiled data on Q fever in Germany (see 20110225.0620), numerous incidents in humans and animals have been recorded throughout the years, including 2 of significance during the previous decade:
- 2003 - an outbreak (299 human cases) was associated with a contaminated ewe in a farmer's market in Soest (North Rhine-Westphalia).
- 2005 - an outbreak (331 human cases, 188 laboratory-confirmed) in Jenna was related to proximity to sheep.

Subscribers may be reminded of the major epidemic of Q fever in Germany's neighbour, the Netherlands, between 2007 and 2010. More than 4000 notified human cases were recorded during the event, which had a seasonal pattern synchronic with the kidding and lambing seasons of goats and sheep, respectively. From its start, experts identified dairy goat farms with Q-fever-induced abortion waves as the primary source. By the end of 2012, Dutch authorities declared the Q-fever outbreak over, after about 50 000 pregnant goats had been culled and the remaining dairy goats had been given mandatory vaccination.

A useful summary and analysis of the Dutch event is available in a recent paper (Ref. below; thanks to Sabine Zentis for drawing our attention to the paper). The authors conclude:

"Our findings deliver evidence that, apart from Q-fever positive farms, land-applied contaminated manure may be a significant source of human Q-fever:
1. The temporal sequence of events, where lambing is followed by field application of manure, and manure application is followed by illness onset in human cases, is compatible with, and suggestive of, a contributing role of manure, given the average incubation period of human Q-fever;
2. A higher percentage of human cases were temporo-spatially linked with contaminated land parcels than with Q-fever positive farms (QFPFs);
3. Incidence of human Q-fever cases was significantly higher around contaminated land parcels than non-contaminated land parcels.
4. Incidence of human Q-fever cases around contaminated land parcels decreased with distance, suggesting an exposure-response relationship, while incidence around non-contaminated land parcels did not;
5. A higher percentage of human cases were temporo-spatially linked with QFPFs with land than QFPFs without land."

It will be interesting to note whether conditions in Bavaria, including land application of manure from sheep or goat farms, are comparable to the ones observed in the Netherlands.
