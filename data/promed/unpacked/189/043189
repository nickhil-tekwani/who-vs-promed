Pakistan: Over 40 Diagnosed with Hemorrhagic Fever
-----------------------------------------------
More than 40 people have been diagnosed with hemorrhagic fever and are
being treated in Karachi, a top health official in the Sindh government
told news agencies on Fri 25 Nov 2005.
Hospitals were on alert after the fever was confirmed to have killed 5
people, including a woman doctor, in the last 6 weeks, health officials
said. Doctors in Karachi have been ordered to take special protective
measures, as the disease can spread by massive bleeding, with which
patients with the fever suffer, he said. "All hospitals were put on high
alert after 5 people died of hemorrhagic fever, and there are over 40 under
treatment," Sindh Health Secretary Naushad Sheikh said.
At least 39 patients have been admitted to the Aga Khan Hospital and 5 to
government hospitals. All 5 of the latest deaths were confirmed on Friday
[25 Nov 2005] as cases of viral hemorrhagic fever, Sheikh said. 28 of the
41 have recovered and have been discharged, Dr. Afia said. She said 7
suspected patients have been confirmed as suffering from dengue fever,
while one was suffering from Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF). "Their
status was lab-confirmed," she said. Zafar said that 34 patients were from
Karachi, 4 from Jacobabad, 3 from Hyderabad, 2 from Balochistan and one
from Larkana.
Pakistan has suffered many cases of CCHF. An outbreak in 2004 claimed 3
lives in Balochistan.
The female doctor, who has died, was admitted to AKUH bleeding profusely
from her mouth, ears and nose.
Meanwhile, Sindh Health Minister Shabbir Qaimkhani has said that all
preventive measures have been taken against viral hemorrhagic fever, CCHF
and bird flu virus. Hospital sources said [that the female doctor and
another doctor] had died and that there are unconfirmed reports that
another AKUH doctor has fallen sick. "We have one confirmed CCHF patient
and 7 or 8 dengue fever patients," said the AKUH sources. "The patients are
not arriving in clusters from one part of Karachi, but from all over the
city," said a doctor. "And their mortality is not that high." However, the
doctor said that there were chances of an epidemic if the government did
not spread awareness.
Naushad Sheikh said that the government is taking action. "9 of our
peripheral hospitals in the city have been directed to take precautions if
any [hemorrhagic fever] patient arrives and to immediately refer them to
JPMC, CHK or Lyari General Hospital," he said. "We will start spreading
awareness (about the virus) through television beginning on Friday [2 Dec
2005]."

Pakistan: Hemorrhagic Fever Emergency Declared in Karachi
-----------------------------------------------
An emergency has been declared in Karachi's hospitals, where more than 50
patients suffering from hemorrhagic fever have been admitted.
Geo Television quoted the Sindh Health Department as saying on Sat 26 Nov
2005 that the deadly virus [Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV)]
has already claimed 5 lives -- including 2 doctors -- in the last 6 weeks.
Provincial Health Secretary Dr. Noshad Sheikh said that an emergency had
been declared in all hospitals of Karachi. The doctors treating patients
suffering from the fever have been directed to take precautionary measures,
Geo Television said. 50 patients, including 25 children, suffering from the
fever have been admitted to the Aga Khan Hospital, 5 to the Jinnah Hospital
and 3 to the Karachi Civil Hospital, Geo Television reported. All patients
are being kept in isolation wards.
Of the patients, 34 are residents of Karachi, 4 are from Jacobabad, 3 from
Hyderabad, 2 from Balochistan and one from Larkana, the television channel
reported.
Karachi Civil Hospital Medical Superintendent Dr. Kaleem Butt told Tanveer
Sher of Daily Times that the patients in his hospital are: a resident of
Karachi's Haji Camp, a resident of Thattha, and a 13-year-old from Jehangir
Road. He said that all 3 had been suffering for the last week from
high-grade fever, which could not be controlled by local doctors. When they
started bleeding from the nose and mouth, their families rushed them to
Civil Hospital, he said.
Butt said that their symptoms indicate that they are suffering from either
CCHV infection or another type of hemorrhagic fever. All 3 patients have
been administered anti-viral treatment and antibiotics, which have helped
stabilize their condition. Their blood samples have been sent to the Aga
Khan University (AKU) Laboratory, and the results are expected by Saturday
[3 Dec 2005] night.
The medical superintendent said that the new ward's capacity will be
enhanced from 10 to 35 beds soon, and a larger staff will be sent to the
isolation ward in 3 shifts from Saturday [3 Dec 2006?]. He said that the
hospital administration has acquired masks, suction machines, oxygen
cylinders, caps and gloves to protect their staff, while extensive
antiseptic spraying has also been carried out.
Karachi's hospitals have so far discharged 28 hemorrhagic fever patients
after their recovery.

[This outbreak of hemorrhagic fever appears to have multiple causes as, so
far, a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis had been established for no more than
9 of the more than 50 patients. Of these 9, 8 were diagnosed as dengue
fever cases and only one as CCHF. Furthermore, the patients were arriving
from different parts of the city, and, so far, there was no discernable
focus of infection as might have been expected in the case of CCHF [but
there are 40 more cases to be lab diagnosed. - Mod.JW]
[It is not clear from these accounts and the preceding account whether the
deceased female doctor contracted infection from hospitalized patients or
in the community. The circumstances surrounding the death of the 2nd doctor
are not revealed. - Mod.CP]
[CCHF is transmitted by ticks, and also by the blood of infected livestock
that have been butchered or prepared in the kitchen, and by infected fluids
from patients. I have never heard of dengue hemorrhagic fever being
transmitted to attending clinicians, so at least the doctors' deaths are
likely to have been due to CCHF. - Mod.JW]
