Anthrax outbreak forces isolation of 2 villages
-------------------------------------------
Health officials are monitoring approximately 90 families in 2
villages in the West Sumba regency, East Nusa Tenggara, for signs of
anthrax after 5 members of the villages died of the infectious
disease, an official said Monday. The deaths forced authorities to
seal off the villages on Saturday and begin mass vaccinations of
livestock in the area, veterinary official Maria Geong said.
"At least 90 families in the 2 isolated villages may have been
contaminated by the anthrax bacteria," Geong said, as quoted by AFP.
The families had eaten the meat of cows and water buffaloes believed
to have been infected, she said. Geong did not say how many people in
total the emergency action affected.
About 2000 people live in the 2 villages, which will be sealed off
for a month to stop the spread of the disease. Apart from killing 5
residents, the disease has resulted in 12 others undergoing intensive
treatment after showing symptoms, Geong said. Geong said a 60-person
team was in the process of vaccinating 50 000 cows, buffaloes, goats
and pigs in the area.
Dead and infected animals have already been burnt but any remnants of
their flesh and bones were now being collected to prevent the further
spread of the disease, AFP reported.
Some 40 people have died from the disease in the East Nusa Tenggara
province since 1994, Geong said.

[Anthrax is sporadic through much of Indonesia now having once been
under good control, affecting cattle, small ruminants, buffalo, and
occasionally horses and pigs. It is seen on West Sumatra, Jambi, DKI
Jakarta, West Java, Central Java, West Nusa Tenggara, East Nusa
Tenggara, South Sulawesi, Southeast Sulawesi, & Central Sulawesi. And
because the veterinary response is reactive, not proactive, we now
routinely see such numbers of human cases. -Mod.MHJ]
