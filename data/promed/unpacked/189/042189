A pathogen, which until now occurred mainly in South America and the Mediterranean, has been reported for the 1st time in soybeans in Germany. The bacterium _Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens_ was discovered in a soybean field trial in the state of Thuringia by scientists from the University of Jena.

Symptoms of leaf yellowing and spotting closely resemble those of the common pathogen _Pseudomonas syringae_. The scientists warn that this represents a serious threat, because if the new pathogen is not recognised, it may spread to other crops. In glasshouse experiments, it could also be transmitted to French beans. These showed much more severe symptoms than the soybeans and lost most of their leaves 3 weeks after infection.

It is unclear how the bacteria arrived in Germany. Infected seeds are suspected. So far no seed testing is required for soybeans in the country, however, the scientists suggest that this is now urgently required. Once plants are infected, there is no treatment. The infected plants in Thuringia have been destroyed.

[_Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens_ pv. _flaccumfaciens_ can cause serious wilt diseases in soybean (_Glycine max_) and French bean (_Phaseolus vulgaris_), as well as other _Phaseolus_ and _Vigna_ species. It has been reported to cause total losses of bean crops. _Pseudomonas_ wilts of these crops are caused by different pathovars: _P. syringae_ pv. _glycinea_ for soybean and _P. s._ pv. _phaseolicola_ for French bean.

_C. f._ pv. _flaccumfaciens_ is considered a quarantineable organism in many countries and has been included in the A2 quarantine list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO). It can be transmitted both within and on seed. It has been reported to survive for more than 20 years in stored seed and for at least 2 winters in soil in the field. The bacterium is thought to enter its host through wounds (but not stomata) and then colonise the vascular tissue, which results in the severe wilting symptoms. Disease management may include long crop rotations and phytosanitation. Use of certified clean seed is paramount.

The report above may indicate the northward spread of a pathogen potentially due to climate warming. Other recent examples from central Europe are the fungi causing black rot (_Diplodia seriata_) and lethal bark canker (_D. mutila_) of apple (ProMED-mail posts 20090914.3230 and 20110718.2172).
