Warfare experts from the USA and Germany gave advice on
decontamination after an anthrax death in the Scottish Borders, a
fatal accident, the inquiry has been told. UK authorities had so
little experience of the disease, they got international help after
the incident in 2006 when a man, 50 years old, of Stobs village near
Hawick, died as a result of inhaling anthrax spores.

Edinburgh Sheriff Court heard there was "limited experience" worldwide
in dealing with such clean-up operations.

Early investigations centered on the man's own home. However, Dr Colin
Ramsay, of Health Protection Scotland, said attention later turned to
drumming classes he had attended. He said he was "surprised" when test
results showed the man was more likely to have caught anthrax while at
the classes rather than from cutting up animal skins in his own home.
His house was found to be clear of spores, but some were found on
drums and at Smailholm village hall near Kelso where classes were
held. The man had attended a class there days before he died.

Dr Ramsay said the investigation results had been unexpected. "We
thought he was more likely to have got it from shaving infected drum
skins, and we were surprised not to find any evidence of that," he
said. "We were equally surprised to find it on the drums themselves
and that this turned out to be the most probable explanation for how
he came into contact with them."

He said they took advice from warfare experts in Germany and America
before instructing US company Sabre to decontaminate the hall using
chlorine dioxide gas in March 2007. "Nobody in the UK had been
involved in anything like this," said Dr Ramsay. "Worldwide, there is
limited experience of dealing with a situation like this."

The inquiry, before Sheriff Principal Edward Bowen QC, continues.

A top scientist has told a hearing it remains "notoriously difficult"
to identify drums infected with anthrax before they are imported to
the UK. Dr Graham Lloyd was giving evidence to a fatal accident
inquiry into the 2006 death of a 50-year-old man. He said it was
"reasonable" to conclude the man had picked up the disease from
contact with infected drums. However, he said there were a "lot of
uncertainties" about whether simply playing drums could release the
spores.

The man, of Stobs village, near Hawick in the Scottish Borders, died
in 2006 after inhaling anthrax spores. The fatal accident inquiry is
hoping to establish exactly where he picked up the disease and why he
was the only person affected.

Dr Lloyd, a consultant clinical scientist in novel and dangerous
pathogens at the Health Protection Agency, told the inquiry his team
tested samples from the man's body. They found a rare strain of
anthrax not seen in the UK before.

The man had been attending West African drumming classes in the
Borders and was known to have been using animal skins to make drums at
home. Suspecting the man had caught the disease while handling
infected animal skins, the scientists tested his cottage but found no
trace of the anthrax. Tests later found it in the home of 2 other
drumming teachers, in a van they used to transport drums, and a garage
at a teacher's parents' house where drums had been stored. It was also
found on 3 drums taken from them for testing after the man's death. Dr
Lloyd said the strain of anthrax discovered appeared to be the same as
that which the man had contracted.

Smailholm village hall, where classes were held and drums stored, had
to be decontaminated after anthrax was found on furniture and floors.

Fiscal depute Martin Macari asked: "Are you able to say how likely it
is that [he] must have got anthrax from being in contact with drums
that were at these locations?" Dr Lloyd replied: "It would seem a
reasonable conclusion, yes." Mr Macari asked whether it was possible
that anthrax spores could be released by simply playing drums. "You
could say it's a possibility, but there are a lot of uncertainties,"
Dr Lloyd added.

He was asked to explain why initial tests on the drumming teachers'
drums had failed to find anthrax but later tests had proved positive.
He said it was difficult to be certain with anthrax and that initial
checks often missed it.

Mr Macari asked how the tests could tell which drums coming into the
UK had anthrax on them. "It's going to be notoriously difficult to be
100 percent certain that any sampling is going to give you the result
that you are looking for; it depends on the style of drum and the
state of it," said Dr Lloyd.

The inquiry, before Sheriff Principal Edward Bowen QC, continues.

It addresses, at least as best as possible in a retroactive manner,
the questions raised in the press last week by the drumming teacher
whose drums brought from Africa were implicated, but who sounded as
though she had been targeted by HPA. As noted on page 30 and 31, the
only drum found to be positive with the genotype with which the
patient was infected belonged to the drumming teacher(s). They had a
number of drums, though, that had contaminated hides and with
different strains

And amazingly enough (or not, if he had only worked with domestic
road-kill badger skins to make drumheads), there was not a spore to
be found at the patient's home and workshop.

The terms of the inquiry were defined on 3 Jul 2008:
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/south_of_scotland/7487212.stm>.

From the very rapid lethality of his infection, it is clear that he
had essentially no resistance to his infection, in spite of his
leucaemic remission. Put another way, if he had missed the class and
bought a contaminated hide, that would have killed him. But in that
regard, it is unfortunate that the investigators sterilized the
infected drums almost as soon as they had tested and found them
positive. A controlled drumming exercise with air samplers would have
revealed much about the probable dose that killed him but was
inadequate to infect anyone else in the class or riding in the drum
owner's van.

On the other hand, we can assume that there will be more instances
with contaminated African goat hides and drums. So I encourage our
members to read the Borders report and, with the advantage of 20:20
hindsight, plan what they will do when they get a case, hopefully
only one, on their doorstep. - Mod.MHJ]
