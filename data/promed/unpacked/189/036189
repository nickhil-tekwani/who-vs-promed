Situation at the Jindalee Nursing home as of 16 Nov 2006
--------------------------------------------------------
[The following communication from Charles Guest, ACT deputy chief health
officer, has been relayed to ProMED-mail by Matthew Mason. It overlaps with
the proceeding posts (see below), but contains additional information
identifying the infectious agent as influenza A virus serotype H1. - Mod.CP]
Further to the ProMED-mail post of 16 Nov 2006 entitled "Undiagnosed
illness, nursing home - Australia (Canberra)(02): 20061115.3272," I would
like to provide the following update and clarification.
The ACT [Australian Capital Territory] Health Protection Service is
assisting with the management of a respiratory disease outbreak at an aged
care facility [the Jindalee Nursing home, Canberra]. The outbreak appeared
to commence on 10 Oct 2006.
Cumulative counts to date [16 Nov 2006] of persons affected by the
respiratory disease are: 56 cases, including 7 staff members. Six deaths
(among elderly, very debilitated residents) have occurred. Denominators: 141
residents; 150 staff.
The outbreak is probably due to an influenza A virus, but is unusual, as
influenza typically occurs in the middle of the year in this region. For
this reason, rigorous diagnostic testing will continue to be required of
cases. PCR testing of nose/throat swabs has resulted in 6 positives out of
10 samples. An H1 subtype has been detected. Sequencing results are expected
on 20 Nov 2006.
The facility reports good influenza vaccination coverage among residents
(greater than 90 per cent) and vaccination rates among staff of about 55 per
cent. Immunization against influenza will continue to be recommended for
unvaccinated residents and staff at the facility, along with infection
control and all other measures specified in the Guidelines for the
Prevention and Control of Influenza Outbreaks in Residential Care Facilities
(CDNA 2005).
Given the continuing nature of the outbreak, and the importance of
preventing spread to other institutions, the prescription of antiviral
therapy (oseltamivir/Tamiflu) for all residents and staff is under way as an
additional preventive measure.
General practitioners in the ACT region and other doctors are being kept
informed of developments.
