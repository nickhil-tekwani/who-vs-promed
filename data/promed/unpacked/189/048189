Mexico: West Nile Virus Infection Surveillance Data as of Wed 22 Oct 2003
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following figures are reproduced from the Resumen Epidemiologico
accompanying the Maps of West Nile Virus Activity in Mexico.
Cumulative totals - Humans
--------------------------
As of Wed 22 Oct 2003, a total of 505 individuals resident in 22 of the 32
states have been tested for evidence of West Nile virus infection: 501 were
seronegative and asymptomatic, and 4 were classified as West Nile virus-
positive; 3 in the state of Chihuahua, and one (confirmed by RT-PCR) in the
state of Sonora. [These figures are unchanged since the last update on Wed 15
Oct 2003. - Mod.CP]
Cumulative totals - Equines
---------------------------
As of Wed 22 Oct 2003, a total of 4938 horses from 20 of the 32 states have
been tested for evidence of West Nile virus infection. Of these animals 1805
were seropositive and 3132 seronegative. All these animals were
asymptomatic. In addition, one animal in the state of Nuevo Leon, which had
the 2nd highest incidence of seropositive animals, was symptomatic and died.
These figures represent an increase of 23 horses tested since Wed 15 Oct
2003, of which 21 were seronegative and 2 seropositive. [The number of
*fatal* cases has not changed since Mon 6 Oct 2003. - Mod.CP]
Cumulative totals - Birds
-------------------------
As of Wed 22 Oct 2003, a total of 17 369 birds from 8 of the 32 states have
been tested for evidence of West Nile virus infection. Of these birds 102
were seropositive (and considered to be asymptomatic) and 17 265 were
seronegative. In addition two dead birds were seropositive. [These figures
are unchanged since the previous update on Wed 15 Oct 2003. - Mod.CP]

[Apart from the addition of 21 seronegative and 2 seropositive equines, these
figures are unchanged since the previous update of Wed 15 Oct 2003. In view
of the apparent precipitous decline in surveillance, or dearth of suspected
cases, weekly updates of the situation in Mexico will no longer be compiled
and will be replaced by individual reports of significant cases.
Overall, these data support the strikingly different trends in mortality and
morbidity observed in Mexico in comparison to those recorded in [the rest of]
North America. In Mexico few wild birds and fewer humans have been diagnosed
West Nile virus-positive, whereas by contrast 37 percent of 4938 equines
tested (given incorrectly as 58 percent in the last update) have been
diagnosed West Nile virus-positive with only a single fatality (0.02
percent). As commented previously, this situation raises questions about the
possible existence of cross-reactivity, as a consequence of infection with
other related flaviviruses, both in terms of conferring protection or
generating false positivity. - Mod.CP]
