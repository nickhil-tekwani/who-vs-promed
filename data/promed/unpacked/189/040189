Regarding the Brazilian boy who died despite treatment with the
"Wisconsin Protocol," this brings to at least 3 the numbers of
patients who received this treatment and died. Two were reported in
MMWR [CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report]. Thus far, only the
original patient survived and it should be noted that the virus was
never recovered from that patient. Thus, it may well be that her
remarkable recovery was due to infection with a defective virus
rather than the treatment. It would be very helpful if the readership
could post additional cases in which the protocol was attempted.

[In fact, the Pernambuco, Brazil case is still alive following
the Wisconsin protocol. - Mod.MPP]

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Donnenberg for his comments, which were
prompted by the report in ProMED-mail archive no. 20090128.0394
posted 28 Jan 2009.

If the virus was significantly defective, it would not have
replicated at all. Unfortunately, rabies virus RNA was not detectable
by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay in samples
taken from the Wisconsin patient, so the rabies virus variant was not
identified in this case (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20041223.3390).
Nor was the rabies virus isolated so that tests for relative
neurovirulence were not possible either.

The Wisconsin patient developed very high titers of rabies antibody in
blood and cerebral spinal fluid, which makes one wonder if she mounted
an unusually vigorous and rapid antibody response to her infection,
that resulted in her clearing the virus quickly that contributed to
her survival. Comments would be welcome from others who have employed
the Wisconsin protocol, especially Dr RE Willoughby and colleagues who
treated the surviving US patient. - Mod.TY].
