Comment from Dr. Henderson on the Status of the Aventis Smallpox
Vaccine
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The vaccine that has recently surfaced [see: Smallpox, diluted vaccine
trial (08) 20020329.3841 was produced in Swiftwater, Pennsylvania,
somewhat more than 40 years ago. The virus titers are generally at 7.5
logs or better, i.e. above the international standard of that time. This
reinforces the belief that [smallpox vaccine, properly preserved,
retains its potency for many, many decades.
The vaccine dilution trials only serve to confirm studies that were done
nearly 50 years ago and repeated on several occasions. Thus, even
these long preserved vaccines perform exactly as you might expect
provided that proper vaccination technique is employed.
Bifurcated needles are essential. The ordinary hypodermic needle or the
lancet will not get these results with the same small amount of vaccine.
There is one manufacturer, Precision, that is now making large
numbers of bifurcated needles but there are at least two other
commercial manufacturers that are commencing production.

Comment from Dr. Sencer on the History of the Aventis Smallpox
Vaccine
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In the ProMED-mail post entitled, "Smallpox, diluted vaccine trial (08)
20020329.3841", Mod.CP commented that: "The curious rediscovery of
this additional quantity of smallpox vaccine in Lyon (or where ever) is
unexplained. The lack of detail may reflect some reluctance on the part
of the EU to release this material and to retain an amount for the
protection of the European population."
In fact the [rediscovered vaccine was produced and stored in
Swiftwater, PA, USA. Avantis bought the vaccine production facility
from Connaught Laboratories, who in turn had bought it from another
company (memory fades). I believe it was the preceding producer that
produced the smallpox vaccine.
As a side comment, the Swiftwater operation was originally a US
Government facility. The Public Health Service's legislative authority
allows it to produce vaccines that are not commercially available. The
Swiftwater facility was the producer of yellow fever vaccine until the
end of WWII.
