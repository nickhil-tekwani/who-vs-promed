The Lexington-Fayette County Health Department is warning people in 2
Fayette County neighborhoods about potential rabid animals.

A horse in the Hamilton Lane/North Yarnallton Pike area and a skunk
near Abbeywood Road both tested positive for rabies this week,
according to a health department statement released on Wednesday [11
Feb 2009]. Department officials are working to determine the level,
if any, of human exposure.

So far, there have been 5 cases of rabies from Fayette County in
2009. In January 2009, a fox and 2 skunks tested positive for rabies.
In 2008, Fayette County had 4 reported cases of rabies, 3 in bats and
one in a skunk.

Rabies, a viral disease of humans, pets and wild animals, is
transmitted from animals to humans by the saliva of a rabid animal,
usually from a bite.

State law requires that all dogs, cats and ferrets maintain a current
rabies vaccination.

Rabies signs vary among species of animals. In humans, the disease is
marked by an onset of headache, fever and malaise, and eventually
coma and usually death.

Lexington residents who suspect an animal to be rabid are advised to
call the Lexington Health Department immediately at (859) 231-9791.

[This seems to be an unusual season for rabies. We have noted several
posting for rabies in the last week or 2. Perhaps our weather
conditions are causing animals to move more in search of food?

The article does not indicate whether the horse acquired rabies from
a skunk, which is quite common, but it provides another opportunity
to remind our readers that vaccinating horses against rabies is very
cheap insurance to protect yourselves and your children. - Mod.TG]
