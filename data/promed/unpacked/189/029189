Few side effects in Israeli smallpox vaccine drive
------------------------------
Israel's smallpox vaccination of 15,000 emergency workers in preparation
for a possible US-led war on Iraq caused few side effects, a Health
Ministry spokesman said on Thursday. Four people were hospitalized as a
result of the vaccination drive, said spokesman Ido Hadari.These included
the child of one worker and the spouse of another, who had come into
contact with their family member's vaccine scar, causing blisters and a
mild fever. The other 2 were treated for minor side effects.
Smallpox vaccination can carry severe side effects and even cause death in
very rare cases. Hadari said Israel was sharing its results with the United
States, which vaccinated 100 military medics on Wednesday in the first wave
of a program to immunize millions of troops and emergency workers who could
be called to respond to any smallpox attack.
Washington launched the drive amid concern some terror organizations could
have developed smallpox into biological weapons.The virus kills around 30
percent of its victims. Israel and the United States also fear Baghdad may
have developed smallpox as a weapon. Israel is preparing for possible Iraqi
missile attacks should the United States launch an offensive against
Baghdad. Babies born in Israel were inoculated with the smallpox vaccine up
until 1980, and all Israeli military conscripts were vaccinated until 1996.
"You can expect that one case out of a million that gets the vaccination
might die. In a population that has been vaccinated in the past, we can say
there will be only one death for every two to four million," Hadari said.
Israel has stockpiled enough doses of smallpox to vaccinate its entire
population of six million. Hadari declined to say when the rest of the
population might be vaccinated.
Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles at Israel in retaliation for US-led air attacks
during the 1991 Gulf War. The missiles were armed with conventional
warheads but some Israelis fear Saddam Hussein may arm Scuds with chemical
or biological warheads if he believes the US is on the verge of ousting him.

Smallpox Vaccination Tips from Israel
It has learned several valuable lessons that would help the implementation
of Bush's inoculation program
---------------------------------
When President George W. Bush announced that Americans should be provided
with smallpox vaccinations to protect them against the threat of biological
terrorism, the health-care community applauded. At the same time, though,
it must be asking itself: How are we going to pull this off?
It can start by taking a look at what Israel has done over the past 6
months. Last July, the country decided to start vaccinating for smallpox in
case of a bioterror attack from Iraq. Since then, it has vaccinated nearly
15,000 emergency-care workers and come up with a plan to quickly inoculate
Israel's entire population of 6 million if hostilities break out.
"The first decision we had to make was how many people and which ones,"
says Ido Harari, a spokesman for the Israeli Health Ministry. It considered
3 alternatives: a mass inoculation of the population, which would take a
week but might have brought the country to a standstill; a month-long
program that would have done the entire country in stages; and a trial-run
vaccination of emergency workers and first responders.
EARLY DETECTION. Israel's health experts chose a combination of the first
and third options: They would vaccinate a test group of about 15,000 first
responders -- plus the remaining population en masse should there be an
attack. Since the smallpox virus requires 10 days to take hold and spread,
that would give health officials about a week to vaccinate everyone.
To make sure they spot a virus the instant it's released and thus have
maximum time to fight it, officials have also launched an information
campaign among health-care workers to help them recognize the signs of
infection (most notably a splotchy rash accompanied with flu-like symptoms).
Phase one of the program has gone pretty much as planned, though with a few
complications. Probably the most surprising was the reluctance of many
health-care workers to get the shots, which pushed back the deadline for
the first 15,000 from October to December. "Part of it is a less than
satisfactory communications effort. But it's mainly a reluctance to take a
chance on getting severe side effects," says Ethan Rubinstein, the head of
the infectious diseases unit at Tel HaShomer Hospital in Tel Aviv.
"LET EVERYONE KNOW." Those side effects can include high fever (which can
hit 50 out of every million recipients of the vaccine), meningitis (15 per
million), and even death (1 per million). The authorities pointed out,
however, that most people who are affected in such ways are toddlers, the
elderly, or those with weakened immune systems, none of whom would be given
the vaccine during the initial inoculation.
So far, only 4 Israelis have been hospitalized in the course of the
inoculation: a spouse and child came down with a mild case of cowpox
[vaccinia] -- from which on version of the smallpox vaccine is made -- and
two people had heavy fevers. All are fine now. "My best advice is
information, information, information," says Hadari. "Let everyone know
exactly how little risk is involved and do everything you can to battle
misconceptions."
According to the Bush plan, 500,000 U.S. first responders and health-care
workers will get their shots in the initial round of immunization, which
began on 19 Dec 2002. With such a large pool of people, any adverse
reaction will be front-page news in the media-intense U.S. -- and make
Americans as reluctant as Israelis to try an inoculation. Already, 2 U.S.
hospitals -- Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, Va., and Grady
Hospital in Atlanta -- have refused to administer the vaccine to workers
based on safety concerns. And that's despite a widespread public-relations
blitz by the White House and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention.
SPECIAL TREATMENTS. In Israel, at least, all resistance to taking the
serum would disappear in case of a smallpox attack, Hadari believes. "If
people start dying from the disease and a mass inoculation is necessary,
public relations about the safety of the vaccine will be the least of our
problems," he says.
Another obstacle would be harder to overcome, though, especially in a mass
inoculation: While the cowpox [vaccinia] version of the smallpox vaccine
works fine for most people, many can't tolerate cowpox -- including, again,
the very young, the very old, and those with weakened immune systems. They
have to be vaccinated with live smallpox antibodies, which must be
harvested from the blood of people who have already been inoculated. For
health officials to collect the antibodies, those who have already received
the needle jab must return to the health clinic a month later and donate
plasma. [The description provided here is consistent with VIG, vaccinia
immune globulin, which is not a vaccine used to prevent smallpox, but
rather is a plasma preparation with antibodies against the vaccinia virus,
which has been used to treat severe adverse events associated with receipt
of the smallpox vaccine. - Mod.MPP]
Israelis were eager to participate in this part of the plan, but the system
suffered from a shortage of plasmaphoresis machines, which are used to
harvest the antibodies. The only such center is located in Tel HaShomer
Hospital, which has about 15 of the $100,000 units. Elat Shinar, the
center's director, says within three months nearly enough plasma had been
collected to protect all the people in the country who would have to have
that version of the serum. "We only needed 2,500 liters, and we're almost
at that level," she says.
PROTECTING PALESTINIANS. In Israel, the initial rush led to long lines and
frustration among donors. "It would have helped to have more machines
located throughout the country," says Hadari. "We've since ordered more."
Plasmaphoresis machines are common to most phlebotomy units in American
hospitals, which should have enough of them on hand.
One of Israel's biggest potential problems wouldn't show up in the U.S.:
The need to protect the Palestinian population. Although the Palestinians
live under limited sovereignty, their health care is considered Israel's
responsibility, since it has reoccupied some Palestinian lands. However,
Hadari says no Israeli doctor would survive the trip to administer the
vaccine. "Right now, they're killing any unarmed Jew who goes into their
territory," he adds. "Any attempt to inoculate the Palestinian population
would be a suicide mission."
For now, such an operation is unnecessary. However, if a smallpox attack
comes, the Palestinians would be as endangered as Israelis, thanks to the
close proximity of the two. In such an instance, Israel would hand some 2
million doses of the vaccine over to Palestinian hospital authorities --
and hope for the best. "They have an infrastructure, and they have the
trained manpower to administer vaccines," says Rosenfeld. "I'm sure they
would be able to handle it."
Yet, Palestinian health authorities have done no advance planning, says one
hospital official who asks to not be named. Nor has have they set up any
coordination with Israeli health authorities. "We have enough problems to
deal with right now," says the official. "We'll have to face that problem
when and if it occurs."

[The reports of 4 adverse events that were serious enough to require
hospitalization while as absolute numbers of adverse events seems small, it
should be put into perspective when we discuss the rates of adverse events
following receipt of a vaccine. In the above case, the 4 adverse events
translate to a rate of 267 adverse events per one million doses of vaccine
administered (or approximately 70,000 cases if the entire population of the
USA were to be vaccinated). In addition, the occurrence of 2 contact cases
(2 cases of vaccinia in contacts of persons receiving the vaccine)
translates into a contact rate of 133 per one million doses of vaccine
administered.
While the above articles do mention that high risk individuals were
excluded from vaccination in Israel during this first round, it does not
give information on the proportion of those vaccinated in this first round
who had a history of prior vaccination with smallpox vaccine (before
1980). Informally, this moderator heard that the majority of individuals
to be vaccinated in this first round were non-naive -- (naive refers to no
prior vaccination, hence non-naive means that the individuals had been
vaccinated with smallpox vaccine in the past).
More information on the Israeli vaccination experience from official
sources would be very much appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
