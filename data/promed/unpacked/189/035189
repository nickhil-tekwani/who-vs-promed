Recommended composition of influenza virus vaccines for use in the
2009 southern hemisphere influenza season
-----------------------------------------------
It is recommended that vaccines for use in the 2009 influenza season
(southern hemisphere winter) contain the following:

- an A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1)-like virus;*
- an A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2)-like virus;**
- a B/Florida/4/2006-like virus.***

*A/South Dakota/6/2007 (an A/Brisbane/59/2007-like virus) is a
current vaccine virus used in live attenuated vaccines.
**A/Brisbane/10/2007 and A/Uruguay/716/2007 (an
A/Brisbane/10/2007-like virus) are current vaccine viruses.
***B/Florida/4/2006 and B/Brisbane/3/2007 (a B/Florida/4/2006-like
virus) are current vaccine viruses.

[Background: Twice annually, the WHO Global Influenza Programme
analyses the global data on circulating influenza strains and issues
recommendations on the formulation of the influenza vaccine for the
following influenza season. These recommendations are used by the
national drug licensing agencies and the pharmaceutical companies to
update the content of the influenza vaccines they produce. An annual
adjustment of the vaccine content is necessary to match the vaccine
with the ever changing antigenic and genetic characteristics of
circulating influenza viruses.

In August 2008, the United States Food and Drug Administration's
Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (see:
ProMED-mail post "Influenza vaccine 2008/2009 - N. hemisphere
20080805.2404") recommended that vaccines to be used in the 2008-2009
influenza season in the U.S. contain the following:

- an A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1)-like virus;
- an A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2)-like virus;*
- a B/Florida/4/2006-like virus.**

*A/Brisbane/10/2007 is a current southern hemisphere vaccine virus.
**B/Florida/4/2006 and B/Brisbane/3/2007 (a B/Florida/4/2006-like
virus) are current (2007/2008) southern hemisphere vaccine viruses.

The influenza vaccine composition to be used in the 2008-2009
influenza season in the U.S. is identical to that recommended by the
World Health Organization on 14 Feb 2008 for the Northern
Hemisphere's 2008-2009.

In summary, perhaps unusually, the composition of the influenza
vaccines for use in the northern and southern hemispheres in 2009 are
identical. - Mod.CP]
