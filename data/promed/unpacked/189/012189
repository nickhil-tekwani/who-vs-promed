Two patients contracted severe infections, and one of them died, from fecal transplants that contained drug-resistant bacteria, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reported on Thursday [13 Jun 2019].

As a result, the agency is halting a number of clinical trials until the researchers conducting them can demonstrate that they have procedures in place to screen donated stool for dangerous organisms, said Dr. Peter Marks, director of the agency's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. In an interview, he did not specify how many trials would be suspended, but said it was "not just a few."

Fecal transplants have come into increasing use to manage severe intestinal disorders, particularly an infection caused by a bacterium called _Clostridium difficile_, which can be deadly and tends to occur in hospitalized patients who have been heavily treated with antibiotics. The idea behind the transplants is to use stool from a healthy donor to restore the normal balance of bacteria and other organisms in the intestine, the microbiome.

In some cases, the transplants have worked quickly and saved the lives of patients who were wasting away with uncontrollable diarrhea. But the procedure is not approved by the FDA and is considered experimental.

In the newly reported cases, both patients' immune systems were already compromised at the time of the transplant, the FDA said. The agency would not explain why they were immunocompromised, why they were given the transplants, who performed the procedures, or when or where the cases occurred.

Both transplants came from the same donor's fecal matter. The report does not state whether the fecal material was given in liquid form as an infusion into the digestive tract or swallowed as pills.

Other samples from the same donor were tested after the patients got sick. The samples were found to harbor the same dangerous germs found in the patients, known as multi-drug-resistant organisms. They were _Escherichia coli_ bacteria that produced an enzyme called extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, which makes them resistant to multiple antibiotics. The stool had not been tested for the germs before being given to the patients.

The FDA on Thursday [13 Jun 2019] issued a warning to researchers that stool from donors in studies of fecal transplantation should be screened for drug-resistant microbes, and not used if those were present. It is also warning patients that the procedure can be risky, is not approved by the agency, and should be used only as a last resort when _C. difficile_ does not respond to standard treatments.

Dr. Marks said the agency was trying to strike a balance between giving patients who need the treatment access to it while also establishing safeguards to protect them from infection. In a statement, he said, "While we support this area of scientific discovery, it's important to note that fecal microbiota for transplantation does not come without risk."

The patients received treatment as part of a clinical trial, and the researchers conducting the trial reported the cases as adverse events to the FDA, which they are required to do. But the rules governing this kind of experiment prohibit the FDA from revealing details about the treatment or who provided it.

Yesterday [13 Jun 2019] the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a safety alert after one patient died and another suffered an invasive infection, with both illnesses caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing _Escherichia coli_ after receiving fecal microbiota transplants (FMTs) from the same donor (https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/safety-availability-biologics/important-safety-alert-regarding-use-fecal-microbiota-transplantation-and-risk-serious-adverse).

The donor stool used in both patients had not been tested for ESBL-producing gram-negative organisms prior to use, and subsequent testing has showed the stool to be positive for ESBL-producing _E. coli_. The FDA, which has not approved FMT for clinical use, said both patients were immunocompromised.

The FDA is also pulling the plug on several ongoing clinical [trials] using FMT, The New York Times reported, until investigators can demonstrate they are screening stool for harmful organisms (https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/13/health/fecal-transplant-fda.html).

"FDA is informing members of the medical and scientific communities and other interested persons of the potential risk of transmission of MDROs [multidrug-resistant organisms] by FMT and the resultant serious adverse reactions that may occur," the FDA said in its safety alert.

FMT is a procedure used to manage _Clostridioides difficile_ [formerly _Clostridium difficile_] infection (CDI) in patients who have not responded to standard therapies.

Last year [2018], the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) recommended FMT with healthy stool if first-line antibiotics fail for the treatment of patients with recurrent CDI. In recent years, several small clinical trials have indicated FMT to be successful for some patients, even life-saving. But as early as July 2013, the FDA warned that FMT was an investigational procedure, and carried with it potential risks, including exposure to multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs). The agency cautioned that physicians must tell patients that FMT carries with it unknown risks before use.

CDI is the leading cause of diarrhea in hospital patients, and one of the most common healthcare-associated infections. The disease sickens nearly 500 000 Americans and is associated with 15 000 to 30 000 deaths annually.

In light of the adverse events, the FDA said yesterday [13 Jun 2019] it recommends that donor screening questions specifically "address risk factors for colonization with MDROs, and exclusion of individuals at higher risk of colonization with MDROs."

The agency also said MDRO testing of donor stool is necessary, and the stool must not be used for FMT if it tests positive. "FDA scientists have determined the specific MDRO testing and frequency that should be implemented," the agency said.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is informing healthcare providers and patients of the potential risk of serious or life-threatening infections with the use of fecal microbiota for transplantation (FMT). The agency is now aware of bacterial infections caused by multi-drug-resistant organisms (MDROs) that have occurred due to transmission of an MDRO from use of investigational FMT.

Summary of the issue:
- 2 immunocompromised adults who received investigational FMT developed invasive infections caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing _Escherichia coli_ (_E.coli_). One of the individuals died.
- FMT used in these 2 individuals was prepared from stool obtained from the same donor.
- The donor stool and resulting FMT used in these 2 individuals were not tested for ESBL-producing gram-negative organisms prior to use. After these adverse events occurred, stored preparations of FMT from this stool donor were tested and found to be positive for ESBL-producing _E. coli_ identical [by genotyping?] to the organisms isolated from the 2 patients.

In July 2013, FDA issued guidance stating that it intends to exercise enforcement discretion under limited conditions regarding the IND requirements for the use of FMT to manage _Clostridium difficile_ (_C. difficile_) infection in patients who have not responded to standard therapies. The guidance states that the FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion provided that the treating physician obtains adequate consent for the use of FMT from the patient or his or her legally authorized representative. The consent should include, at a minimum, a statement that the use of FMT to manage _C. difficile_ is investigational and a discussion of its potential risks. The FDA is informing members of the medical and scientific communities and other interested persons of the potential risk of transmission of MDROs by FMT and the resultant serious adverse reactions that may occur. Patients considering FMT to treat _C. difficile_ infection should speak to their healthcare provider to understand the potential risks associated with the product's use.

Because of these serious adverse reactions that occurred with investigational FMT, the FDA has determined that the following protections are needed for any investigational use of FMT:
- Donor screening with questions that specifically address risk factors for colonization with MDROs, and exclusion of individuals at higher risk of colonization with MDROs.
- MDRO testing of donor stool and exclusion of stool that tests positive for MDRO. FDA scientists have determined the specific MDRO testing and frequency that should be implemented.

The FDA encourages all healthcare providers administering FMT products to report suspected adverse events to the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or http://www.fda.gov/medwatch.

[The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has classified human stool as a biological agent and determined that its use in fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) therapy and other research should be regulated to ensure patient safety.

With regard to the use of FMT for treating _Clostridium difficile_ infection (CDI) in patients who have not responded to standard therapies, the treating physician must obtain an adequate consent that now explains the risk of infection due to multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs). Also, donor screening must now include questions that specifically address risk factors for colonization with MDROs, and exclusion of individuals at higher risk of colonization with MDROs, as well as testing donor stool for MDROs and its exclusion if MDRO-positive.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) updated the 2010 clinical practice guideline on CDI in 2018 (https://www.idsociety.org/practice-guideline/clostridium-difficile/): Either vancomycin or fidaxomicin is recommended over metronidazole for an initial episode of CDI; treat a 1st recurrence of CDI with oral vancomycin as a tapered and pulsed regimen or fidaxomicin; FMT is recommended for patients with multiple recurrences of CDI who have failed to respond to appropriate antibiotic treatments. Intestinal infection following FMT with some microorganisms (e.g., cytomegalovirus and norovirus) has been recognized in the past (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4986962/), but not infection with multidrug-resistant organisms, like MDROs, such as ESBL-producing _E. coli_.

ESBLs (i.e., extended-spectrum beta-lactamases) are beta-lactamases that hydrolyze penicillins and cephalosporins, including the extended-spectrum cephalosporins with an oxyimino side chain (cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, and cefepime), as well as the oxyimino-monobactam aztreonam. Most ESBLs are inhibited by beta-lactamase inhibitors such as clavulanate, sulbactam, or tazobactam in vitro, but the clinical effectiveness of beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations cannot be relied upon consistently for therapy (Stratton C. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases: an unappreciated global problem. Medscape. Available at http://www.medscape.org/viewarticle/442307). ESBL-producing _E. coli_ are consequently resistant to most beta-lactam antibiotics, except the carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem, doripenem, and ertapenem).

There are multiple types of ESBLs, such as TEM, SHV, CTX-M, and OXA, each with multiple subtypes (http://cmr.asm.org/content/18/4/657.full). Community-acquired ESBL-producing _E. coli_ have frequently been CTX-M-type ESBLs (http://www.jwatch.org/id201303130000003/2013/03/13/community-acquisition-esbl-producing-e-coli, http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/13/7/07-0094_article). We are not told the type of ESBL involved in the 2 patients described in the news reports above.

The genes encoding ESBLs are located mainly on transferable genetic elements, and are often linked with other antibiotic-resistance genes, including genes that encode resistance to fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin), aminoglycosides (e.g., gentamicin), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. - Mod.ML
