Anthrax suspected in Mackenzie Bison Sanctuary Yellowknife, N.W.T.
------------------------------------------------------------------
A total of 7 bison carcasses found in the Mackenzie Bison Sanctuary
are being tested for possible anthrax infection. Crews found the 7
carcasses 30 kilometres [18.6 miles] northwest of Fort Province,
marking the 1st time since 1993 that anthrax could be detected within
the borders of the Sanctuary.

Samples have been sent to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency lab in
Lethbridge to determine whether the bison had the disease.

The spokesperson with the Department of Environment and Natural
Resources (ENR), Ella Stinson, says teams are burning the carcasses
and treating the soil in the surrounding area [with formaldehyde. - Mod.MHJ]

There are cabins in the vicinity, and the ENR is warning residents
nearby to avoid the site and any contact with dead bison. The
suspected cases in the Mackenzie Bison Sanctuary follow an outbreak
earlier this summer in the Slave River Lowlands, where 45 dead bison
were found.

[The Mackenzie Sanctuary, on the west side of the Great Slave Lake
and north of the Mackenzie river draining the lake, suffered a 10
percent mortality in 1993 among the 1800 bison there; and the
survivors had a very high prevalence of significant antibody titres
the following March 1994. This population of bison is believed to
have originated from explorers from the Slave River Lowlands (SRL)
crossing the frozen Mackenzie in wintertime.

The sanctuary was overflown regularly in the mid-1990s and no cases
were seen. And it has been checked out since over the years. The
belief was that the very thorough carcass burning during the 1993
epidemic and subsequent high herd immunity had successfully prevented
a recurrence. Hopefully this will be a limited outbreak. If it is
anthrax a genomic analysis should show whether this is a recurrence
of the 1993 strain or a 2nd migration from the SRL. - Mod.MHJ]
