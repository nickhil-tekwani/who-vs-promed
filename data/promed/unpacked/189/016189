A suspected case of monkeypox, was recorded in the city of Butembo, North Kivu province (eastern DRC), and was reported to the press on 15 Sep [2012] by Dr. Mundama Witende, Chief Medical Officer of the District of Butembo.

"The patient's [illness] is under control and is being monitored," he said, adding that samples were taken and sent to specialized centers. According to Dr. Mundama, people vaccinated against smallpox cannot contract the disease.

Monkeypox is a viral disease identified in primates and rodents. It is often contracted through the consumption of monkey meat and some rodents. It is transmitted to humans through the bite or contact with blood of an infected animal.

From 1970 to 1996, cases of human monkeypox were reported in DRC, Nigeria, Cote d'Ivoire, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Central African Republic and Gabon.

[Rodents, such as rope squirrels, door mice and pouched rats, are the suspected reservoir hosts, with monkeys and humans as secondary, spill-over hosts. The monkeypox virus in the Congo has a higher case fatality rate than the virus in West Africa, where fatal cases are rare or absent. Monkeypox can infect humans and cause lesions clinically similar to those caused by smallpox virus. However, unlike smallpox virus, monkeypox virus is not efficiently transmitted from person to person. Chickenpox lesions can be confused with monkeypox disease by health care workers not familiar with the differences. It will be interesting to know the results of the laboratory tests when they become available.

Butembo is a city in North Kivu in northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo lying west of Virunga National Park.
