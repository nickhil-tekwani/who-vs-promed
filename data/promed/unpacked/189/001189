United front fights outbreak in deer, elk
------------------
Biologists, Oregon State Police, sheriff's deputies, treaty tribal
members, hunters, ranchers, zookeepers -- even state and county
road crews that come upon roadkill -- have spread throughout
Oregon this fall in a determined effort to make sure a deadly brain
disease hasn't invaded from its strongholds in Rocky Mountain
states and Canadian provinces.
The 500 to 1500 samples being collected mark the state's most
intense and widespread surveillance of big game animals, part of a
nationwide race against chronic wasting disease, a fatal, incurable
disease. It threatens North America's wild and domestic herds, along
with billions of dollars invested in hunting, farming, and wildlife
management.
The best and earliest test thus far is possible only on the brain stems
of animals within 24 hours of death, making the fall hunting seasons
a perfect sampling window.
So far, Oregon is disease-free, but chronic wasting has been
diagnosed in free-ranging or captive mule deer, white-tailed deer,
and elk in 11 states and 2 Canadian provinces, some of which have
slaughtered thousands of wild deer and farmed elk to stem the
spread.
Last week, it was reported in an elk at Wind Cave National Park
near Mount Rushmore, South Dakota's second case in a wild elk. In
early November 2002, Illinois' first case was diagnosed.
Chronic wasting, similar to mad cow and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
in humans, appears limited to deer and elk. Testing across the
continent concentrates on those 2 species, with surveillance and
research on other species in their family, called cervids. They
include a wide range of grazing animals, from moose, caribou, and
reindeer to tiny imports such as axis, fallow, and sika deer.
Oregon is gathering as many specimens as possible from its 67
geographic game management units through December 2002.
They'll be shipped in January 2003 to the National Veterinary
Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa. Results are expected in the
spring or early summer. Another intense collection scheduled for
2003 will give biologists a far better idea of the disease's presence,
and annual tests will continue for the foreseeable future.
Dozens of states, including Oregon, have banned all interstate traffic
on cervids, putting a growing elk-ranching industry on the skids and
affecting species that haven't been afflicted, such as axis, fallow,
and sika deer raised for their restaurant-quality venison. Even
reindeer used in live Santa Claus displays are banned from crossing
many state lines.
Cottam and other biologists in Oregon began with buck deer
seasons in late September, but poor hunting in dry fall weather
almost immediately sent them searching for additional sources.
"We've gotten a lot of cooperation," said Cottam, who's attached to
Fish and Wildlife's Newport office. "And it's across the board, with
hunters, game farmers, tribal hunters, road crews, state police,
everyone. I've actually gotten many of my samples from department
employees who call me from their own hunts. Nobody wants this
here."
Perhaps the most unusual collection point is the Wildlife Safari
"meat wagon," which has a state permit to search Winston-area
roadways each morning for fresh roadkill to feed its large cats. The
drive-through zoo has contributed more than 20 skulls to the state's
effort.
Don Whittaker, a staff biologist coordinating the sampling, said extra
attention is being paid to regions such as the northern areas of
Central Oregon, where tuberculosis was discovered last year at an
elk-ranching operation.
Linda Detwiler, a veterinarian for the Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service in Robbinsville, N.J., said the Ames lab
participated in a nationwide symposium on chronic wasting held in
July [2002] in Denver. Interest was so high, she said, that the lab
certified and contracted with 15 private labs to handle the increased
traffic. Larry Cooper, deputy wildlife division director for the
Department of Fish and Wildlife, said Oregon has been told that the
federal government will pay the testing bills at $35 to $50 apiece.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture offers chronic wasting disease
information at:

"Ultimately, we're going to find a better test for it," Detwiler said.
Numerous companies are working on a live test for chronic wasting
in cervids. They think they'll have the tests certified and on the
market in 2003 or 2004, making year-round sampling far more
feasible, and more palatable for biologists such as Cottam, limited
now to testing animals already killed or those that biologists might
have to kill if the infection appears.
Finding a cure, however, is far less certain, because little is known
about chronic wasting's cause and transmission. "Veterinarians like
to think more in terms of prevention," Detwiler said.
