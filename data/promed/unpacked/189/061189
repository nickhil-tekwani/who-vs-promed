The Mozambican government is sending a delegation to the northern provinces
of Cabo Delgado and Nampula to investigate series of deaths attributed to
fish poisoning. At least 91 people are reported to have died from diarrhoea
and related ailments attributed to consumption of poisoned fish. The
Maputo-based Noticias newspaper Tuesday quoted the deputy minister of
agriculture and fisheries, Isidora Faztudo, as saying that the ministry had
already sent technical teams to the affected areas.
Samples of the dried fish which are believed to have caused the poisoning
are being subjected to further laboratory analysis in attempts to identify
the exact nature of the poison involved. The main symptoms of the poisoning
are violent diarrhoea and vomiting. Doctors in Cabo Delgado say that the
common denominator in the cases is that all those interviewed say they ate
fish shortly before falling ill.
Last week, Prime Minister Pascoal Mocumbi said that initial analyses of
dried fish from Cabo Delgado showed no presence of harmful microorganisms
(bacteria or viruses). But there were traces of chemicals "similar to
pesticides," he told parliament. The common belief is that pesticides were
dumped into the sea, possibly by unscrupulous fishermen in an attempt to
increase their catch. Large numbers of dead fish were then washed ashore,
where local people smoked, dried and eventually ate them.
However, the worst of the outbreak may be over as no further deaths have
been reported since Thursday. Arsenio Xavier, director of the Cabo Delgado
provincial hospital, said over the weekend that the health services only
attended a few "isolated" cases of diarrhoea.
