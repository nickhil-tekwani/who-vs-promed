Following unconfirmed reports of possums [_Trichosurus vulpecula_] showing signs of "wobbly possum disease" in Northland, the Animal Health Board (AHB) is warning people not to spread the introduced pest around the region.

"Moving any wild animals into new areas is extremely irresponsible," said Northern North Island Regional coordinator Frank Pavitt. "Not only could you be circulating one infectious virus -- wobbly possum disease -- in an attempt to control the pests' population, you may also expose an area to bovine TB that was previously free of the disease," said Mr Pavitt.

Previous wild animal surveys have given the AHB confidence that possums in the region are currently free of TB. To ensure that remains the case, wild animals must not be moved around greater Northland, or introduced from other regions of New Zealand. If bovine TB was present in any of these animals, their movement creates a greater risk of re-introducing the disease and spreading it throughout the far north. While possums and ferrets can harbour and spread bovine TB, wild pigs and deer may also carry the disease and pass it to possums and ferrets. When these possums or ferrets come into contact with livestock, there is a high chance they will pass TB to cattle and deer.

"Even in TB-free areas, we need hunters and farmers to continue disposing of animal carcasses correctly. They should burn or bury the animal or risk passing TB, if it is present, on to scavenging wildlife," said Mr Pavitt.

Wobbly possum symptoms include a lack of coordination, head tremors, daytime feeding, and blindness. Over a period of 6 weeks, the possum becomes weak, sleeps on the ground, and loses interest in its surroundings. The disease is transmitted through animal to animal contact and is usually fatal to possums.

[This article is a bit confusing. It starts out talking of wobbly possum syndrome and immediately goes to relocation of animals and bovine tuberculosis (TB).

One has to understand that the possum in New Zealand transmits TB, much as the badger does in the UK.

When one understands the possums may be ill with wobbly possum syndrome, and moving them presents a risk of introducing TB into a different region of the country, then the article makes a bit more sense.

However, wobbly possum is an interesting syndrome. It has been demonstrated that the cause is probably a virus, but it has not been positively identified and characterised.

The clinical signs of wobbly possum disease include extensive behavioral changes, making it easily identifiable in live animals (Thompson et al, 1999). Animals are seen out feeding during the day and show progressive ataxia, with an unusual head carriage, head bobbing and an unusual stance with legs wide apart as they struggle to maintain balance. The possums are typically in poor condition, often scouring and being wasted around the hindquarters. In the later stages of the disease, possums are "wobbly" -- unsteady on their legs, unable to judge distances, and slow to react. At the tissue level, there are extensive lesions in the kidney, liver, and spleen (which explains the need to feed during the day, as the animal attempts to maintain an adequate nutrition), and in the brain (which explains the ataxia). These extensive histopathological changes make it relatively easy to confirm the disease at postmortem examination.
