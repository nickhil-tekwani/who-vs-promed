Classical swine fever in Israel
-------------------------------
(Note: (GAH) monitors outbreaks of high impact diseases around the
world. Classical swine fever (CSF) is among those diseases of major concern).

Disease report
--------------
Israel reported an outbreak of classical swine fever in both domestic
pigs and wild boar in Hazafon region (see map at source URL). The
pigs were in the same ownership but placed in 2 locations, 70 m (230
ft) apart. Pigs on one location showed clinical signs. The infected
farm is located 3.5 km (2.2 mi) from the Lebanese border, which is
open to wild boar movement. Eleven wild boar were found dead within a
4 km (2.5 mi) radius of the farm.

Preliminary tests indicate that they also may be positive for CSF.
Final confirmation of the infection both in domestic pigs and wild
boar is expected [obtained in the meantime. - Mod.AS] Disease control
measures were put in place (OIE, 2009).

Situation assessment
--------------------
This is the 1st reported incident of CSF in Israel. Recently,
outbreaks of FMD in goats and sheep and BTV-4 in cattle were reported
from the same region (Hazafon). It could be possible that CSF was
detected due to increased monitoring for FMD.

Pozzi and others (2008) reported that pig farming is restricted to
only 24 premises in the Northern part of Israel. Approximately 170
000 pigs a year are produced for slaughter. These 24 farms appear to
be interconnected and may share access.

Preliminary genotype studies show the virus isolated from domestic
pigs had high sequence similarity to virus isolates from China in
2002 and Germany in 1997. At this stage, information on which strain
may be present is pending further laboratory tests. There are no CSF
serotypes currently held in the CSF reference laboratory database for
this region (Institute of Virology, 2009). No outbreaks of CSF have
ever been reported from the Near East (OIE 2009b). Therefore, these
findings represent an important epidemiological development. At this
stage, it remains uncertain how the disease may have been introduced
into Israel.

Israel is not on the EU list of approved countries for import of live
pigs and fresh pig meat. Processed products (that is, canned pig
meat, pet food rendered fats, pig bristles, blood products,
by-products for pharmaceutical use) are permitted subject to official
certification. Available data from TRACES (the EU electronic
notification system) show no imports of any of these processed
products from Israel to the UK for the past 6 months.

Preliminary testing of 11 dead wild boar suggests that they may have
been infected with CSF. Should this be confirmed, this would also be
a significant epidemiological finding, which may suggest that the
disease has been present in this region for a longer period of time.

Wild boar are known to be distributed across a large area of Europe
and Asia (see map below from IUCN 2008 [International Union for
Conservation of Nature, available at source URL]). The disease report
mentions that wild boar are free to roam in the area and therefore
may be responsible for introducing disease to domestic pigs.

Conclusions
-----------
Currently, we consider that there would be negligible likelihood of
the introduction of CSF into the UK pig population through legal
trade from Israel. Once again, this finding highlights the importance
of prompt disease reporting of suspected CSF cases, and maintaining
appropriate biosecurity and compliance with the ban on swill feeding
in the UK. We continue to monitor and review the situation.

[Though rare occurrence of later minor outbreaks cannot be excluded,
the only traceable official report on past outbreaks of CSF in Israel
dates back to the era of the British rule in Palestine, prior to the
establishment of the State of Israel (1948). The 1939 annual report
of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, Government of
Palestine (Government Printer, Jerusalem) states, under "Diseases of
swine" (article 209, page 39): "An outbreak of swine fever with very
heavy mortality occurred in a piggery near Jaffa. Material was
received at the Government Veterinary Laboratory, and examination
confirmed the suspicion that the disease was swine fever. This is the
1st occasion that this disease has been diagnosed in Palestine."

A follow-up report of the current outbreak, as well as information
about the CSF situation in Lebanon, are anticipated. - Mod.AS
