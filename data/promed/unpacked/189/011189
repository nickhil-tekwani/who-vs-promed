A total of 63 people, among them 53 schoolchildren, have been poisoned by
an unidentified substance in Chechnya's Helkovskoi district, sources in the
republic's Health Ministry said.
"A total of 63 people, including 53 pupils, had been diagnosed with
poisoning by Wednesday morning. 55 of them have been hospitalized,
including 45 children," Umar Akhyadov, chief doctor of the ministry's
emergency medicine center, told Interfax.
Akhyadov said he does not rule out the possibility that "reports that are
expected to arrive from all hospitals later today may indicate a larger
numbers of patients."

39 people in the Russian republic of Chechnya have been admitted to
hospital suffering from suspected nerve gas poisoning, officials said. The
first outbreaks of an unknown illness were reported on Friday in the
republic's Shelkovskoi district.
Those affected include school pupils, teachers and workers from a school in
the village of Starogladovskaya. 4 people are said to be in serious condition.
Symptoms include breathing problems, fever, headaches and numbness in
limbs. The head of the Shelkovskoi district administration, Khusein
Nukhayev, has said the illnesses were likely caused by a poison gas, but
was unable to say which type.
A mobile laboratory from the Russian city of Rostov-on-the-Don is carrying
out tests.
Chechnya's prosecutor-general Valery Kuznetsov said "to speak about a
terrorist act is premature" but "all possibilities are being considered",
Russian news agency Tass reported.
Separatist fighters have waged a bitter war against Russian federal forces
for a decade, with attacks taking place both inside the republic and
elsewhere in southern Russia.

[The whole idea of poisonous gas seems a little odd. Most psychotropic
gases wear off in a relatively short time, unless there is ongoing
continuous exposure. People in the hospital they should have been removed
from the source, and the condition should be improving. That does not seem
to be happening. The clinical symptoms do not fit most of the known nerve
gases. It is possible it is a newly manufactured gas, but I am not willing
to subscribe to the conspiracy theory without more proof, such as
toxicology tests. - Mod.TG]
