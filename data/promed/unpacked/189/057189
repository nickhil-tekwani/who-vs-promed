Media reports said between 20 and 30 passengers were vomiting on a Santiago to Sydney flight. Dozens of people were rushed off a Qantas flight for medical treatment in Sydney on Thursday [1 Aug 2013] after a stomach bug struck mid-journey, triggering a mass vomiting episode. Qantas said a "number of passengers travelling in the same group on QF28 (between Santiago and Sydney) became unwell with a gastrointestinal illness" on the 14-hour journey to Australia. Media reports said between 20 and 30 passengers were vomiting as they disembarked in Sydney and were met by a fleet of ambulances.

"It is believed the illness was contracted before boarding the aircraft and symptoms became evident during the flight," Qantas said in a statement. "The aircraft has been met by medical staff to look after the unwell passengers." As a precaution, Qantas said all other passengers on the flight were advised to monitor their health closely over the next 24-48 hours.

Health authorities said they had been advised that: "26 passengers returning on a Qantas flight from Santiago, Chile, developed vomiting and diarrhoea on the plane, consistent with norovirus infection, a common cause of outbreaks of gastroenteritis in Australia and elsewhere."

"New South Wales Health has provided Qantas with a letter and factsheet about viral gastroenteritis to distribute to all departing passengers, as well as advice for cleaning and cabin staff," the state's health office said in a statement.

It said the sick group was assessed by paramedics and escorted out of the airport "with minimal exposure to other passengers" after they were cleared to go home.

[This outbreak has been attributed to norovirus infection, which is often associated with rapid onset outbreaks of vomiting of short duration followed by rapid recovery. Norovirus outbreaks are often associated with travellers and passengers on cruise ships, situations where people from diverse backgrounds congregate together in close proximity. However, the suddenness of the outbreak on the Quantas flight apparently restricted to a group of people travelling together suggests other causes such as staphylococcal food poisoning, contracted before or after boarding, which has a 1-6 hour incubation period. It would be of value to know if any of the sick passengers were febrile, as fever may be present with norovirus infection but not with staphylococcal food poisoning. - Mods.DK/CP
