Since October 2021, the number of cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), caused by the H5N1 subtype has increased. Although most detections have been in wild birds, some have also been identified in poultry. HPAI H5N1 has been reported in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Israel, Italy, Germany, Denmark, Serbia, and Russia.

The following information comes from a scientific report (Conclusion section, page 5) providing an avian influenza overview in the EU/EEA and UK published on 29 Sep 2021, which is available at https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/avian-influenza-overview-september-2021.pdf:

"The presence of HPAI virus in western Russia and north of the Mongolian border with Russia, linked to key migration areas of wild waterbirds, is of concern due to the possible spread of the virus via wild birds migrating to the EU. Autumn migration from breeding sites to wintering sites is ongoing, and the low temperature of autumn and winter may facilitate the environmental survival of avian influenza virus potentially introduced to Europe. According to data available, the northern and eastern areas of Europe are likely to be the first places of new virus introduction. However, despite the increasing number of HPAI A(H5)-affected countries and outbreaks outside Europe, there is considerable uncertainty about the real geographical distribution of these viruses, particularly in wild birds and along the flyways.

"During summer, HPAI A(H5) viruses were detected at lower levels than in winter and spring in resident wild bird populations in Europe, primarily in northern areas. HPAI outbreaks also occurred in poultry and captive birds in a few European countries. Despite this, the observed persistence of HPAI in wild birds in northern Europe into September 2021, in contrast with previous years, may indicate a risk for virus entry into poultry farms not only from wild birds migrating into Europe in the autumn and the winter, but also from wild birds that are resident in Europe.

"The occurrence of HPAI A(H5) virus incursions in commercial farms even where birds are kept indoors raises concern about the capacity of applied biosecurity measures in effectively preventing virus exposure. Biosecurity standards should be revised and reinforced, and their implementation regularly checked, primarily in poultry production systems at high risk of avian influenza.

"The 2020-2021 epidemic with a total of 1298 outbreaks in poultry, 22,9 million birds affected, 85 detections in captive birds, and 2,394 events in wild birds in 31 European countries appears to be one of the largest HPAI epidemics that has ever occurred in Europe. Note that the number of reported wild bird events is an underestimate of the total number of wild birds that have died from HPAI during this epidemic."
