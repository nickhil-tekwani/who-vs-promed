Puppy farm at centre of canine brucellosis outbreak has 700 breeding bitches
----------------------------------------------------------------------
It is being reported that an outbreak of canine brucellosis on a
puppy farm in Ireland could pose a serious public health risk as the
disease can be passed on to humans. This according to the Dublin SPCA
[Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals] and the Ulster SPCA.

The 2 organisations have reported that the puppy farm in question is
home to a staggering 700 breeding bitches and there are currently up
to 300 puppies on the premises.

The farm's owner has refused to sign an undertaking not to move the
dogs off-site before an official inspection can take place to
investigate the extent of the problem.

Someone from the farm told the Irish Times that the 2 animal welfare
agencies were involved in acts of "intimidation" against the establishment.

Canine brucellosis is transmissible to humans and can cause liver
damage and arthritis.

"We got accurate information on Friday [2 May 2009] that this man was
intending moving and selling these dogs and we acted on it,"
according to Jimmy Cahill, chief executive of the DSPCA. "The guards
were very helpful but the owners refused to let us see the dogs or
any of the carcasses [see comment below. - Mod.AS]. If there is an
outbreak of canine brucellosis it could have a devastating impact on
the greyhound industry," he added.

Brucellosis in humans is a potentially life-threatening disease and
is difficult to treat. There are several varieties of brucellosis,
all caused by bacteria of the genus _Brucella_, the most notable
being _B. abortus_ [affecting mainly cattle. - Mod.AS] and _B.
melitensis_ [affecting mainly goats and sheep. - Mod.AS], and _B.
canis_ which infects dogs and other canids.

All are widely spread around the world. The most severe infections
are thought to be associated with _B. melitensis_, which primarily
infects goats, sheep, and camels in the Mediterranean, Asia, Latin
America, parts of Africa, and some southern European countries.
Humans can catch _B. canis_ through contact with the body fluids of
infected dogs, especially semen, urine, and vaginal fluids.

Dogs can be infected with brucellosis without showing any signs or
symptoms, and infection can only be diagnosed with specific blood tests.

The typical symptoms of the type of brucellosis contracted from dogs
are: fever that comes and goes, loss of appetite, fatigue, weakness,
malaise, sore joints, low back pain, spine pain, headache,
depression, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhoea, vomiting,
weakness, dizziness, unsteadiness of gait, and urinary retention.
Heart and lung complications can occur.

A Department of Agriculture veterinary source told the Times that an
outbreak of canine brucellosis would be "extremely unusual."

[Canine brucellosis, caused by _Brucella canis_, is an important
cause of reproductive failure, particularly in kennels and can end
the reproductive career of a breeding animal. _B. canis_ is zoonotic,
although disease appears to be rare in humans. Other _Brucella_
species occasionally associated with disease in dogs include _B.
abortus_, _B. melitensis_, and _B. suis_. Genetic and immunologic
evidence suggests that all members of the genus _Brucella_ are closely related.

Dogs are the only species known to be affected by _B. canis_;
however, antibodies to this organism have been found in other carnivores.

_B. canis_ has been reported from the United States (particularly the
southern states), Canada, Central and South America (including
Mexico), some European countries, Tunisia, Nigeria, Madagascar,
Malaysia, India, Korea, Japan, and China. _B. canis_ is probably
found throughout most of the world; however, New Zealand and
Australia appear to be free of this organism.

In dogs, _B. canis_ is mainly transmitted by contact with the fetus
and fetal membranes after abortions/stillbirths, or by venereal
transmission. This organism can be found in vaginal discharges for 4
to 6 weeks after an abortion. It is also shed in normal vaginal
secretions, particularly during estrus, as well as in milk. High
concentrations of _B. canis_ are found in semen for up to 2 months
after infection, and intermittent shedding of smaller quantities can
occur for years. _B. canis_ is also found in urine, and low
concentrations of bacteria may be excreted in saliva, nasal and
ocular secretions, and feces.

Canine brucellosis is usually introduced into a kennel in an infected
dog or semen. This disease is controlled by sanitation and the
removal of infected dogs. Housing in individual cages reduces the
spread of the organism. Repeated testing and the removal of
seropositive or culture-positive animals, combined with quarantine
and testing of newly added dogs, have been used to eradicate
brucellosis from some kennels. There is no vaccine for _B. canis_.

Long-term antibiotic therapy has been used successfully to treat some
dogs, but some animals relapse. Neutering can be used as an
additional control measure.

Humans usually become infected with _Brucella_ spp. by ingesting
organisms or by the contamination of mucous membranes and abraded
skin. Infection with _B. canis_ seems to require close contact with
infected dogs or contact with bacterial cultures. The virulence of
this organism for humans may be low. Approximately 30 cases have been
reported worldwide since the 1960s. However, _B. canis_ infections
can be difficult to diagnose in humans and may be underreported. In
symptomatic cases, brucellosis is extremely variable and the clinical
signs may appear insidiously or abruptly. Typically, this disease
begins as an acute febrile illness with nonspecific flu-like signs
such as fever, headache, malaise, back pain, myalgia, and generalized aches.

Mortality in dogs, due to _B. canis_, is highly unusual. The
mentioning of "carcasses" on the kennel's premises is in need of
clarification, and a laboratory confirmation of the exceptionally
extensive outbreak reported above is anticipated.
