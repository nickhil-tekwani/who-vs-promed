Drs Camilla Rothe and Mirjam Schunk at the GeoSentinel Site in Munich have reported a case of a 49-year-old male German who presented with macrohematuria in June 2020. Urogenital schistosomiasis was confirmed upon bladder biopsy, as well as in his urine (microscopy and PCR). Genotyping revealed a _Schistosoma haematobium_/_S. bovis_ hybrid.

The patient had never travelled outside Europe. He had, however, been to Corsica island (France) twice, in 2019 and 2013. He never swam in the Cavu River, where cases of schistosomiasis had been reported in previous years (including by GeoSentinel; see Gautret P et al.). History suggests he most likely was infected in 2019 bathing in the Solenzara River, close to a busy camping site. The Solenzara river does not communicate with the Cavu river.

The particular _S. haematobium_/_S. bovis_ hybrid is the same as identified during the previous outbreak (see Moné H et al.). This case suggests that transmission of schistosomiasis transmission in Corsica is ongoing and now occurring in another river. Clinicians should make sure that they screen returned travelers from Corsica for schistosomiasis.

[The outbreak in Corsica was first reported in 2014 with the Cavu River being the only known focus. From the travel history of this patient it seems that schistosomiasis is also found in the Solenzara River.

In 2018 it was found that the _Schistosoma_ isolated from the Cavu river was a _S. haematobium_/_S. bovis_ hybrid and the same parasite has now been confirmed in the parasite from the patient infected in the Solenzara River. Thus, it seems that schistosomiasis probably is more widespread in freshwater sources in Corsica than previously thought. - Mod.EP
