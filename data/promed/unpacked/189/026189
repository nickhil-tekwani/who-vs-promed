Karnataka to distribute certified potato seeds
----------------------------------------------
Concerned over the alarming decline in the area under potato and the
occurrence of late blight, the Karnataka government has launched a drive to
tackle the disease. The state horticulture department has tied up with the
National Seed Corporation Limited (NSCL), a government of India
undertaking, to supply certified potato seed [tubers] directly to farmers
on a pilot basis. "The farmers have lost a sizeable portion of their crop
even during 2009 by using uncertified seeds," officials said.

The late blight disease, which occurs due to low temperature, has severely
hit the potato crop in the state for the past few years. Major growing
areas in Hassan and Kolar districts have reported the disease in a vast
area. As a result, many farmers are shifting from potato to maize and ginger.

[For example], the area under potato has dropped from 67 891 hectares
[about 168 000 acres] in 2007-08 to around 18 000 hectares [about 45 000
acres] in 2009-10 in Hassan, which accounts for over 50 per cent of the
state's total produce annually. The horticulture department has imported
496 tonnes of certified potato seeds from NSCL for distribution in Hassan.
The seeds will be distributed from 10 May [2010] onwards based on monsoon
estimates. Depending on the response it will be scaled up. From 2011
onwards, the department proposes to take up seed production on its own.

[Potato late blight (PLB) is caused by the fungus-like organism
_Phytophthora infestans_ and can cause 100 per cent crop loss. The pathogen
can also affect tomato and some other solanaceous crops. PLB is spread by
plant material (including potato seed tubers), wind, and water. Disease
management generally relies on fungicide treatments of seed tubers and
crops. Considerable variation in aggressiveness between different pathogen
strains has been observed, but new and more virulent strains are emerging
frequently.

While PLB often causes problems in the region of India and its neighbours,
the disease has been extraordinarily rampant since 2008, with outbreaks
reported from several states (ProMED-mail posts listed below). Weather
conditions have been partly blamed, but emergence of a new strain with
increased fungicide resistances cannot be excluded. Infected seed potatoes
have been considered to play an important role in recent outbreaks, and
certification programmes like the one described above have previously
reduced PLB impact on potato industries in other countries. However, their
effectiveness depends on reliable fungicide treatments of seed tubers and
crops (see ProMED-mail post 20090131.0435).
