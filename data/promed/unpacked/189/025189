Putnam County health officials are searching for the owner or owners
of 2 dogs that may have tussled with a rabid raccoon in Kent last
week. The county Health Department learned Monday [22 Nov 2010] that
the raccoon tested positive for rabies, heightening concern that the
2 dogs be found and given a rabies-vaccine booster shot.

Although the department has a photograph of the dogs -- courtesy of
the LaCrosse Road homeowner who called police about the sick-acting
raccoon -- officials know nothing else about them. They're not even
sure if the canines -- one black and one tan -- come from the same
home, although assistant public health sanitarian Marianne Burdick
said that's possible. "From the pictures, the (dogs') collars look
identical," she said.

The dogs, she said, were running around for a few hours after they
were near the raccoon on 18 Nov 2010, making it unlikely they could
carry any raccoon saliva containing viable rabies virus on their
coats and infect a human. The worry now is getting them that booster
shot.

Burdick said health workers have canvassed the neighborhood near
Seven Hills Lake with no success. The raccoon was the county's 9th
confirmed case of rabies this year [2010], following 5 other
raccoons, 2 skunks and a cat.

Police shot and killed an apparently rabid raccoon in Mohnton on
Saturday [20 Nov 2010] morning after it chased a cat then attacked
and bit a dog. Dave and Linda Henry's husky was attacked while it was
tied to the porch. The raccoon bit the dog in the hindquarters,
tearing the skin, as well as a rear leg and just above the eye,
Palange said. The dog, which had been vaccinated for rabies, was
treated at a local veterinary hospital, he said.

The incident started about 8:20 in the 1st block of East Wyomissing
Avenue and ended less than a half-hour later when a Cumru Township
policeman shot the animal on a nearby hillside, Mohnton Patrolman
James A. Palange said.

[3] Bat, possible human exposure - North Carolina

County officials are warning residents in the Rosehill Road area to
be on the alert for sick and abnormal-acting wildlife after a bat
found inside a resident's home over the weekend tested positive for
rabies.

The bat was discovered in a home on McChoen Drive on Saturday [27 Nov
2010] and was captured alive by an Animal Services officer, said
Sally Shutt, a spokeswoman for the county. The bat tried to bite the
Animal Services officer, but it wasn't immediately known whether
anyone had been bitten, Shutt said.

The bat was removed from the home alive and taken to the Animal
Services office, where it was killed and frozen until it could be
shipped to the State Public Health Lab in Raleigh on Monday [29 Nov
2010], Shutt said. The lab confirmed Tuesday [30 Nov 2010] that the
bat had rabies.

"The Animal Services person who brought it out is at the emergency
room now being checked out," Shutt said. "The bites are so minute
that it's hard to tell if you've actually been bitten." Animal
Services was at the home Tuesday [30 Nov 2010] talking to the
residents and trying to determine whether they had been exposed, she
said. They were advised to seek medical attention.

Another bat was removed from the same home in August 2010, but it was
not rabid, according to county officials. [So how are the bats
getting into the house, or is this a regular roosting place for the
bats in the attic or some other place in the house? - Mod.TG]

The revelation prompted county officials to ask residents in the area
to be on the lookout for potentially diseased animals and to avoid
wild animals along with stray cats and dogs. Pet owners were being
asked to check that their animals are up to date on vaccines.

Anyone bitten or scratched by an animal should wash the wound with
soap and water, then seek medical help, according to county officials.

A rabid skunk attacked a family dog near Robbins in the early morning
hours last Monday [15 or 22 Nov 2010?]. Animal Control officers had
to put down 3 beloved pets whose inoculations were out of date after
tests confirmed that the skunk did have rabies.

"I woke up hearing barking," the dog owner said. "A skunk was in the
dog pen fighting Sandy. She was a white Pekingese. They fought for 45
minutes, but she would not let go. All I had was a shotgun." The
owner said he couldn't get a clear shot on the skunk that wouldn't
also hit his pet. Two other dogs were in the pen, but not in the
fight, "Cookie, also a white Pekingese, who was her pup, and our male
Rue-ru," he said. "It was about 3 in the morning. I went out, and my
1st thought was, 'What is that terrible smell?' It was still in my
nose the next day at the ER."

There was a shepherd dog in a 2nd lot, but the Pekingese owners lost
not only Sandy but also both the other Pekingese once rabies was
confirmed. "Animal Control had to put all 3 down," he said. "It was a
hard lesson. If you want to keep your dogs, get them a rabies shot."

Moore County Animal Control makes house calls to administer rabies
vaccinations for a USD 5 charge. Preventing the dread disease is one
thing at the top of Al Carter's list. He is director of operations at
the center.

"We went the next morning," the dogs owner said. "They checked me
over and didn't find any cuts or any scratches where I could get
infected." He didn't have to take the shots. They are very costly.

[5a] Otter, canine, human exposure - Florida [3 parts]

There is an aggressive otter on the loose in Boca Raton, Florida. In
fact, this otter may have actually bitten 3 people total in the area.
In addition, a dog has also been attacked by an otter.

There is no clear picture as to whether the same otter is involved in
all the attacks, but officials are concerned that it is the same
aggressive otter in all cases. On 18 Nov 2010, the otter attacked a
dog. Then on 21 Nov 2010, the Boca Raton otter bit 2 people. Finally
last week, yet another man was attacked by an aggressive otter.
Officials in the region are advising people to avoid contact with
wildlife.

If this aggressive otter in Boca Raton does indeed have rabies, then
experts believe it will soon die. People originally thought the tales
of the otter attack were a joke. However, they are not, and the
situation is serious. It is quite unusual for an otter to attack like
this, which is why it is likely the same otter is responsible for all
the attacks in Boca Raton. Animal control is working to catch this
otter to determine what it may have if anything.

A 3rd person has now fallen victim to an otter attack. Officials said
the otter came out of a canal near Yamato Road and 441, bit a man in
his back yard, and then swam off Wednesday [24 Nov 2010].

The animal attacked 2 people and a dog earlier in the week. Health
officials are warning residents in Boca Raton that the otter may have
rabies and to avoid contact with all wildlife.

A dead otter found floating in a Boca Raton lake not far from where
an otter attack was previously reported has tested positive for
rabies.

Palm Beach County Animal Care & Control retrieved the body Wednesday
[1 Dec 2010] and announced the results of the rabies test Thursday.

Weeks earlier, 3 people and a dog were attacked by an otter in the
area. They were treated with rabies vaccines as a precaution.

[We do not often hear of animals like an otter becoming infected with
rabies. However, any mammal is susceptible to rabies.

It is likely that the people were treated with post exposure
prophylaxis, while the dog was likely current on vaccinations and
revaccinated.

It would have been reasonable to suspect that the otter was
protecting pups, but in the absence of any pups, rabies should
certainly have been on the rule-out list. - Mod.TG]

[6] Fox, possible child exposure - Florida

A "sick" fox that has been the cause of much concern was finally
captured Monday [29 Nov 2010] morning at Suwannee Elementary School
by Live Oak Animal Control.

City animal control officer Wayne Hunter said schoolchildren had been
feeding the fox for 2 or 3 weeks. Photos of the tranquilized fox show
an animal with mange and numerous open wounds. The animal was
obviously ill, said Hunter.

Since 1st reported to animal control by school officials and worried
residents, animal control has made several attempts to catch the fox,
but only succeeded Monday [29 Nov 2010] morning after the animal
attempted to follow a school janitor into the building, according to
Hunter. He said it is not normal behavior for a fox to allow people
to feed it, to try entering public buildings and to act seemingly
tame. The animal has been euthanized and its body sent to be tested
for rabies, said Hunter.

Animal control will continue to patrol the area to make sure no other
potentially rabid foxes approach the school. City animal control has
received at least 2 additional reports of foxes exhibiting unusual
behavior, according to Hunter. Yet another instance occurred on
Thanksgiving [25 Nov 2010].

At the intersection of 169th Road and 76th Street (Mitchell Road),
Daniel and Becky Price of Live Oak saw a fox they described as
"beautiful." Daniel stopped their van to take a photograph of the
animal, at which point it began chattering its teeth and salivating
before approaching him.

He called sheriff's dispatch and was referred to the Florida Fish and
Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC), which authorized him to kill
the animal. Per FWC instructions, he burned the carcass.

Foxes are one of the top 3 carriers of rabies, Hunter said.
Thankfully, he noted, no one was harmed or bitten by the fox at SES.
Nonetheless, he urged caution.

[What is surprising is that they would not test the head of the fox
and that animal control would allow this person to burn the carcass.
Why wasn't animal control taking a more active role? Was this person

Residents of the Comstock area were faced with the reality that
rabies was in their neighborhood, when 2 local dogs were attacked by
a skunk on 8 Nov 2010. The skunk was killed and sent for testing,
which came back positive for rabies. Unfortunately, the dog owner was
forced to have both put down, as they fought with the skunk for more
than 30 minutes and had not been vaccinated.

[8] Coyote, possible canine - Colorado

A coyote in Cortez has tested positive for rabies, according to lab
results from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.

The Colorado Division of Wildlife and Montezuma County Health
Department submitted the coyote for rabies testing after property
owners reported it was acting strangely by trying to enter a fenced
enclosure with dogs and showing no fear of loud noises or being
approached by humans.

Behavior suggested the coyote was infected with rabies, and test
results confirmed the disease, with the most likely strain being that
from a rabid bat.

So far in 2010, the state health department and Colorado State
University diagnostic laboratories have confirmed rabies in 138
animals.

"This is a good time to remind people to keep their pets' rabies
vaccinations up to date and to take a few simple precautions to avoid
pets coming in contact with wildlife," said Elisabeth Lawaczeck,
state health veterinarian at the Colorado Department of Public Health
and Environment. "Having pets vaccinated is the simplest and most
effective way to protect pets and family members from this deadly
disease. I encourage pet owners to contact their veterinarian and get
their pets up to date on vaccinations."

Lawaczeck said: "We have a cooperative surveillance project with
local health departments, animal control agencies, the Colorado
Department of Agriculture, the Colorado Division of Wildlife and
Colorado State University to track the spread of the disease. In
Colorado, bats and skunks are the most likely animals to test
positive for rabies."

So far this year [2010], Colorado has reported 64 bats, 62 skunks, 7
foxes, one domestic cat, one horse, one mule deer and one muskrat
tested positive for rabies.

[9] Skunk, canine - Texas

Randall County has recorded 7 cases of rabies this year [2010], and
skunks are the primary carrier, officials said.

In 2008, there were no reported cases, but 6 were reported in 2009,
said Dr. James Alexander, regional zoonosis control veterinarian for
the Texas Department of State Health Services in Region 1. In 2006
and 2007, the county recorded just one case each year. Six of this
year's [2010] 7 Randall County cases have been linked to skunks,
Alexander said. "By far, skunks are our No. 1 species," he said.
"Frequently with skunks, we will have situations where they try to
carry off or kill a litter of kittens or pups."

Canyon officials confirmed on 22 Nov 2010 that a rabid skunk was
killed inside the city limits. Animal Control officer Lisa Cox shot
and killed the rabid skunk on 19 Nov 2010 after finding it in a
backyard that had 2 small dogs inside, she said.

The infected skunk, which appeared to be young, was standing in front
of the barking dogs without a response, she said. The skunk's head
was sent to a testing laboratory, and the lab confirmed the animal
was rabid, Cox said. "Usually a skunk is going to run away from you.
If one of those animals starts coming toward you ... and if they're
out during the day, it's usually a good sign (they are infected with
rabies)," Cox said.

Neither dog was bitten, but both dogs, which were current on their
vaccinations, have been treated with additional booster shots and are
under watch for 45 days for any abnormal behavior that could indicate
an infection, Cox said.

A basset hound stepped in to save a little girl from serious injury
when she was attacked by a wild animal. The child, age, 4, was
walking up to her grandparents' home when a fox latched onto her.
"That was like the scariest thing ever. To turn around and see this
wild animal trying to chew on your kid," said the child's mother. But
Callie and Abbie, the family dogs, came to the rescue and scared it
off.

This same fox apparently tried to attack an adult as well. "The fox
is coming right up here to get at me, so I throw a hammer at it,"
said the 2nd person, who was also attacked by a fox.

The fox stalked the 2nd person at his home on Wednesday [24 Nov 2010]
morning and a 2nd time in his garage. Leicester police were able to
shoot and kill that animal on the 2nd person's driveway.

Doctors checked the child, and they say she is at no risk of rabies
exposure. The Animal Control Department will test the animal for
rabies on Friday [26 Nov 2010] and will reveal the results on Monday.
