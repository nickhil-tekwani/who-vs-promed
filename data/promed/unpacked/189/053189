Message posted by Massimo Tarditi on the FOODSAFE list [but edited by
Moderator CHC, in some places considerably, for readability and to avoid
lawsuits. We have had numerous messages directly and indirectly from Massimo
Tarditi but most have been highly speculative and I have been sitting on them
waiting for some hard data. I now suspect it will not come. With the
following I am cutting this string until and unless we receive something
definitive. It is clear to me that protocols, procedures and regulations on
food handling in at least the Turin section of Italy are somewhat less than
optimal. Mod CHC]:
Dear foodsafers,
In last week you found on this mailing list updates about the most recent
episode of foodborne outbreak in Turin and surrounding. Now all the people
involved have gone home from hospital, but the etiologic agent is still
unknown. This is due to the unavailability of samples of the food that was
served.
The latest news is that within 4-5 days we will have results of chemical and
microbiological analyses.
The producer of canned sweetcorn, interviewed by national TV has affirmed
that "sweetcorn was harvested and processed in August '96. Overall
production was 50,000,000 cans. The lot served in Turin's schools was
about 16,000 cans, 11,500 sold in Italy, without any problem".
This is the last [latest? chc] of a list of foodborne outbreaks in Turin's
and surrounding schools: [source of information? chc]
1992: about 500 intoxicated by _C. Perfringens_ in schools of Chivasso
(cooked beef, unchilled)
1994: about 600 intoxicated by _B. cereus_ in Turin's schools (surimi
cool salad, prepared one day before)
1995: about 60 intoxicated by _B. cereus_ in Turin (pasta) end 1995 -
beginning 1996: two different times the same plant (Sogerco) is suspected for
toxy-infections caused by pasta with meat and cheese (lasagne al forno):
symptoms, involving 10-15 childrens each time, include vomiting after 2 hours
from ingestion; analyses found nothing in food samples.
1997: "mother of all toxy-infections" as you have read in last days in
foodsafe mail-list.
Now, if you like, I give some personal comments, accompanied by official
data:
In the period 1995-1997 City of Turin have spent 1,500,000,000 ITL
(about 1,000,000 USD) for analyses and inspections but some school have
not yet an adequate number of refrigerators and warmers.
[He goes on about what he believes to be low standards for food purity. If
what he says are the standards, they certainly are not high, are perhaps
disgraceful.- CHC]

[The term "vertigins" was used and one person communicated that this term is
unsettling to him. He suspects this term should be used with only three
foodborne illnesses: botulism, trichinosis and cysticercosis. Assuming the
incubation period is short, then mild botulism might be something to
consider. Abramo Ottolenghi says the word "vertigine" in non-medical Italian
can simply mean dizziness. Clearly there is a very unclear etiology. These
are the sorts of reports that make ProMED-mail difficult (and even annoying)
to read at times. I posted this in spite of suhc risk because it is unlikely
that an "emerging" disease would have the characteristics of the common cold.
However, this and preceding reports on this subject (whatever the subject is)
are instructive in showing that definitive epidemiologic investigations are
an absolute necessity and that opinions, single-case reports, and media
speculations are not at all useful. If you are about to send a message to
ProMED-mail letting us know that this series of reports was not at all
"information", consider the we had to edit all this stuff. Provisional end
of string. -- Mod CHC]
