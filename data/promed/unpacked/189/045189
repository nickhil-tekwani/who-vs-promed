Domesticated guinea pigs, locally named as "cuyes", not only are part of
the diet during the funeral activities, but families in Andean communities
breed a lot of guinea pigs into their "little" households for their diet
and also to generate heat.
In these sense it is probably that transmission were due to:
1)human-to-human transmission via infected droplets from people with
productive cough during funerals (the most frequently form of transmission
of pneumonic plague),
2)by bites of infected fleas during funerals,
3)by ingestion of infected guinea pigs during funerals.

For control activities it is important to know what is the prevalence of
infected animals (guinea pigs, dogs, pigs) in the neighborhood of these
households.

I would remember that Cavia rodents are bred in and around houses in the
Andes, being linked to Chagas' disease. Its role in plague epidemiology
should be cleared.

The original newspaper article that was carried in its entirety (in Spanish)
in ProMED-PORT Digest v 98 # 43 did speculate that the probable mode of
transmission was via droplets at the funerals. I was not aware of the guinea
pig mortality until I read Dr. Proano's post.
Personally I am at a disadvantage because my information was second hand
from the press but Dr. Proano's post certainly opened some very interesting
possibilities.
The cuy mortality does open the possibility that fleas were involved but as
Dr. Moreira points out pneumonic plague is usually transmitted by droplets.
I would question the probability of the eating of contaminated meat being
the source since the meat is very thoroughly cooked.
In relation to eating cuyes my first recollection is that of an 8 year old
immigrant boy from Italy who observed the horror in his mother's face when
travelling from the coast to Quito by train we were offered cuyes during a
stop.

[It can be somewhat disconcerting when one is invited to dine in an Andean
village and the house owner reaches under the table, picks up a wriggling
guinea pig, and some 30 minutes later one is eating it. Actually they are
very tastey and nutritious as long as one watches for the bones. While
cooking a bacteraemic guinea pig should kill any _Yersinia_ sp., the
cook(s) would
be at risk through cuts in their hands and/or from rubbing eyes with a
bloody hand. Their intimate relationship with an Andean household would make
them ideal theoretical sentinels as well as flea-feeders ... the reality and
the answers to Dr Moreira's questions still await clarification however. -
