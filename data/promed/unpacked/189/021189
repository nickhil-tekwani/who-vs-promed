Outbreak of Aseptic Meningitis Attributed to Echovirus Type 30
--------------------------------------------------------------
Bulgarian National Television announced yesterday that there were 10
new cases of [aseptic meningitis in Bulgaria. Of these 4 have been
confirmed by Bulgarian epidemiologists.
In addition to these [confirmed cases there have been reports of sick
children in villages near Vraca, Haskovo and other Bulgarian towns.
The illness is spread mainly among gypsies and is associated with low
hygiene.
Bulgarian epidemiologists have established that the cause of [this
outbreak of aseptic meningitis is the enterovirus, Echovirus type 30.

[Aseptic meningitis is a common manifestation of enteroviral
infection. Central nervous system disease is associated with about
half of reported echovirus infections. Echoviruses types 6, 9, 11, 19
and 30 are regularly associated with outbreaks of aseptic meningitis.
Recovery is usually complete within a few weeks, although residual
effects may persist for some weeks and there is a low risk of serious
neurological damage in the first year of life. We note that reports in
previous years have come from Romania & Hungary (see refs. above),
also countries with large gypsy populations - Mods.CP, JW
