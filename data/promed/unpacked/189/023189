Case of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease suspected in French Caribbean
-----------------------------------------
POINTE-A-PITRE: On Sat 26 May 2001, officials in the French Caribbean
[island of Guadeloupe confirmed 3 cases of a brain-wasting ailment, one of
which could be a case of the human form of mad cow disease. One patient is
on the island of St Martin and the other 2 are on Guadeloupe.
According to the French government's top official on Guadeloupe, Jean
Francois Carenco, one of the 3 cases [may be suffering from variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), the human variation of the disease linked
to the consumption of beef infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE; known also as mad cow disease). The other 2 cases are suspected to be
another form of the fatal ailment not linked to eating infected meat
[sporadic or familial CJD, he said.
Earlier on Sat 26 May 2001 in Paris, Health Ministry officials said they
were still trying to determine whether the 3 patients had familial or
variant CJD. In mainland France 3 people have already died from vCJD,
whereas in Britain, where BSE was identified in 1995, 100 people have [now
contracted the [disease. In 1997, a woman in Guadeloupe died from a form
of the disease not linked to BSE [again, sporadic or familial CJD.

[It is not clear why vCJD rather than sporadic or familial CJD is suspected
in one of the 3 cases. In the absence of laboratory confirmation, the
likely indicators of vCJD might be recent residence in Britain, France or
Ireland, or young age. Although variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is now
abbreviated as vCJD, ProMED-mail headings still use the abbreviation CJD
(new var.) to facilitate archive searches. - Mod.CP
