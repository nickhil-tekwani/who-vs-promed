Major foot-and-mouth outbreak in Egypt threatens the region: mobilizing vaccines, strong regional coordinated action crucial
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Urgent action is required to control a major outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] and prevent its spread throughout North Africa and the Middle East, which could have serious implications for food security in the region, FAO warned today [22 Mar 2012]. With vaccines urgently needed, international and regional organizations are at the ready to assist in developing a regional prevention, preparedness, and action plan.

In Egypt 40 222 cases of the disease are suspected, according to official estimates, and 4658 animals, mostly calves, have already died. According to FAO's livestock census data, 6.3 million buffalo and cattle and 7.5 million sheep and goats are at risk in Egypt. Although FMD has circulated in the country for some years, this is an entirely new introduction of a virus strain known as SAT2, and livestock have no immune protection against it.

Further to a request by the Egyptian Government, an FAO emergency team was in the country last week [week of 12 Mar 2012] assessing the situation with veterinary authorities. They jointly set up a 1st line of containment measures and the roll out of a national FMD control strategy. The strategy is focused on limiting the disease's spread by implementing biosecurity measures and by use of vaccination when available.

"We are working closely to support the government to bring the outbreak under control. The area around the Lower Nile Delta appears to be severely affected, while other areas in Upper Egypt and the west appear less so," said Juan Lubroth, FAO's Chief Veterinary Officer, calling for strong action to prevent the disease from spreading further.

In order to help prevent the spread of the virus, livestock attendants are urged to take a series of measures including: limiting animal movements and avoiding contact with animals from other farms; avoiding purchasing animals in the immediate term since they could have come from contaminated sources; and properly disposing of carcasses preferably by incineration or, failing that, by burying them.

Vaccines are in limited supply for the FMD virus now present in Egypt. The country has some reserves of its own vaccines, but these do not protect against the SAT2 strain, and Egypt could need regional support in mobilizing effective ones. Even if they become available quickly, vaccines sometimes take up to 2 weeks to confer immunity, so FAO is urging coordination at all levels of government to implement biosecurity measures to limit the spread of the disease.

FMD affects all cloven-hoofed animals, including sheep, goats, cattle, buffalo, and pigs. It causes serious production losses and can be lethal, particularly to younger animals.

Meat and milk from sick animals are unsafe for consumption, not because FMD affects humans, but because foodstuffs entering the food chain should only come from animals that are known to be healthy.

The virus that causes FMD passes rapidly between animals through airborne droplets and normal contact, but humans in close contact with animals can transport it too via the soles of shoes, or on their hands or clothing. FMD is not a direct threat to humans.

[In the past, exotic FMD viruses were the cause of panzootics which spread throughout the Near East. A remarkable example was the rapid dissemination of FMDV serotype SAT1, which occurred initially in Bahrain in December 1961. The virus spread north westwards to reach Iraq, Jordan, Israel, and Syria by April 1962, continuing to Iran and Turkey. In September 1962, this serotype crossed the Bosphorus to enter Europe for the 1st time, and in November 1962, caused an outbreak further west, near the border between Turkey and Greece. Preventing the further spread within Europe was addressed by the European Commission for the Control of Foot-and-Mouth Disease (EuFMD), one of FAO's oldest Commissions, established in 1954. - Mod.AS
