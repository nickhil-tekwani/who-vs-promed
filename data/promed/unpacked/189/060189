Re: Babesiosis, tigers - India (Bhopal): suspected, request for information
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Upon ProMED-mail's request, the following background information on
babesiosis in felines has been kindly forwarded by Prof Eugene
Pipano, Koret School of Veterinary Medicine, Rehovot, Israel -- for
which we are grateful. - Mod.AS]

Three species of _Babesia_ are known in wild felids: _Babesia felis_,
_B. leo_, and _B. herpailuri_ (_B. pantherae_ ?). Unidentified
_Babesia_ parasites have been reported from various parts of the
world. _Babesia_ parasites are undergoing re-classification on the
basis of molecular analysis.

It is assumed that, similar to the transmission of _Babesia_
parasites in other animal species, _Babesia_ parasites in felids are
transmitted by ticks. However, to date no ticks have been
identified as vectors of feline babesiosis.

The following drugs are recommended in felids suffering from babesiosis
1. Primaquine sulfate (also used for treatment of human malaria) at
doses of about 0.5 mg/kg.
2. Clindamycin: the usual dose in cats is 5-10 mg/pound by mouth, once a day.
3. Some authors recommend treatment with oxytetracycline (OTC) [see
reference re bovines].
4. Various other drugs, mainly antimalarials, have been used to treat
felids with babesiosis.

Another question is whether the parasites seen in this specific tiger
were indeed _Babesia_ sp.. Domestic cats and wild felids
are susceptible to a parasite belonging to the genus _Theileria_,
_Cytauxzoon felis_, and the erythrocytic stages of this parasite are
rather similar to _Babesia_ parasites in microscope slides.

vaccine by treatment with long acting oxytetracycline. Vet Rec.

Re: Babesiosis, tigers - India (Bhopal)
---------------------------------------
About 15 years ago I went to Bannerghatta National Park, near
Bangalore to see some sick, captive tigers that had been recently
imported from UK. Blood smears revealed _Trypanosoma evansi_,
probably acquired from the cow meat they were being fed or from
biting flies, of which there were many. Treatment with suramin
(Antrypol, ICI) was successful.

The tigers may well have babesiosis but the presence of severe
gastritis and clinical description sound like possible _Galoncus
perniciosus_ (hookworm) infection. There was a similar die off of
tigers with diarrhea and wasting at the Ragunan Zoo outside Jakarta
[Indonesia] in 2001 that was ultimately attributed to this parasite.

[The hookworm _Galoncus perniciosus _ has been found also to infect
lions in Northern Rhodesia; see Le Roux, PL 1958. Trans. R. Soc.
Trop. Med. Hyg. 52: 14 and a leopard in India, see Death of a wild
Indian leopard, Panthera pardus Fusca (Meyer) due to parasitism with
lung fluke Paragonimus westermanii (Kerbert, 1878) and the hookworm
Galoncus perniciosus (Linstow, 1885). J. Vet. Anim. Sci., 24 (1): 44-46.
