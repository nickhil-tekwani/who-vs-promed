Serious health concerns are emerging from recent door-to-door sales
in Indianapolis, from which at least one person has become seriously
ill. Someone is selling unpasteurized cheese on the city's west side.
The Marion County Health Department said it was made aware of the
bad, white cheese on Tue 24 Apr 2007. Officials are worried that
others might buy the product.
The cheese was contaminated with a bacteria called _Listeria_.
Experts said that it takes at least 3 weeks before someone who eats
something contaminated with _Listeria_ to notice symptoms.
"If something tastes bad, if it's spoiled, we tend not to eat it. We
avoid it," said Dr. Crystal Jones, medical director of acute diseases
for the Marion County Health Department. "_Listeria_ can be in
something that tastes perfectly good. We just don't know it, and if
we're in one of those at-risk populations, it can become a very
serious thing."

[Another posting from the litany of diseases associated with
unpasteurized dairy products...
_Listeria monocytogenes_ has been associated with such foods as raw
milk, supposedly pasteurized fluid milk, cheeses (particularly
soft-ripened varieties), ice cream, raw vegetables, fermented
raw-meat sausages, cold cuts, raw and cooked poultry, raw meats (all
types), and raw and smoked fish. Its ability to grow at temperatures
as low as 3 C permits multiplication in refrigerated foods. It is
particularly associated with intrauterine infection of pregnant women
and meningitis in individuals with depression of cellular immunity.
Indianapolis is located in Marion County in central Indiana and can
