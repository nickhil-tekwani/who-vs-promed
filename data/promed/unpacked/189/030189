An Illinois company is recalling pet chews made of pig's ears because
they could be contaminated with salmonella.

One illness, to a dog in Missouri, has been linked to the chews,
called Pig Ears for Pet Treats. The product is being recalled by the
Keys Manufacturing Co. Inc. of Paris, Ill. _Salmonella_ can affect
animals, and there is risk to people from handling contaminated pet
products.

The bacteria can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in
young children, elderly people, and those with weakened immune
systems. Symptoms [in humans] include fever, diarrhea, nausea,
vomiting, and abdominal pain. Pets with salmonella may be lethargic
and have diarrhea or bloody diarrhea, fever, and vomiting.

The pet treats were distributed in Arkansas, Florida, Illinois,
Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri,
Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Virginia.

Consumers can return the pet treats to the place of purchase for a
full refund.

[Salmonellosis is a bacterial disease caused by bacteria of the genus
_Salmonella._ Many different kinds of _Salmonella_ can make people
sick. Most people have diarrhea, fever, and stomach pain that start 1
to 3 days after they get infected. These symptoms usually go away
after 1 week. Sometimes, people have to see a doctor or go to the
hospital because the diarrhea is severe or the infection has affected
other organs.

The severity of salmonellosis in dogs and cats varies from a
subclinical carrier state, which is the most common, to one of acute
enterocolitis. This may include fever, anorexia, lethargy, diarrhea
possibly with mucus or blood, and abdominal pain (infection is often
associated with mesenteric lymphadenitis). Cats may present with
prolonged periods of fever and anorexia without diarrhea. Additionally
either the cat or the dog may develop septicemia or endotoxemia.
Salmonellosis in cats has also been caused "song bird fever,"
reflecting association with predation on infected migratory birds.

The role of dogs and cats in zoonotic transmission
--------------------------------------------------
_Salmonella_ infections in dogs and cats deserve special comment for
several reasons related to zoonotic transmission:

_Salmonella_ spp. can be isolated from healthy dogs and cats at rates
of up to 36 percent and 18 percent, respectively. Dogs and cats tend
to shed _Salmonella_ organisms for very prolonged periods of time
after infection. Dogs and especially cats can shed _Salmonella_
organisms in both their feces and saliva, meaning that transmission
can occur via licking.

Pig ear dog treats may be a source of _Salmonella_ infection for both
dogs and humans that handle the treats. Dogs and cats may suffer
salmonellosis as a "reverse zoonosis," with infection transmitted from
human-to-dog and subsequently back to other humans.

Similarly, outbreaks of _Salmonella_ infections in large animal
teaching hospitals have been linked to the introduction of bacteria
from infected human personnel, with subsequent spread to animals and
then back to other human workers.
