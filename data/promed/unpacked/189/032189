[ref: AT Lehrer, et al. High incidence of _Sugarcane yellow leaf virus_
(SCYLV) in sugar plantations and germplasm collections in Thailand.
Australasian Plant Disease Notes 2008; 3(1): 89-92; DOI:10.1071/DN08036]
-----------------------------------------
_Sugarcane yellow leaf virus_ (SCYLV) infected plants may be free of
obvious symptoms; thus infections and subsequent spread of SCYLV may fail
to be noted, resulting in underestimation of the problem. Sugarcane is an
important commodity for Thailand and disease control of sugarcane is,
therefore, of vital economic interest.

Sugarcane plantations and germplasm collections (more than 300 sugarcane
cultivars) from across Thailand were tested in 2 surveys within the years
2000-2003 for _Sugarcane yellow leaf virus_ infection. 25 to 100 per cent
of cultivars tested at each plantation/germplasm collection were infected,
among them those which had been imported from international breeding stations.

This report shows that SCYLV is widespread in Thai plantations and
germplasm collections. Plantation management based on resistant cultivars
or virus-free seed cane is proposed. Whether SCYLV is spreading further in
Thailand needs to be determined.

[Yellow leaf disease (YLD) of sugarcane was first reported from East Africa
in 1968 and has since been recorded in the Americas, Hawaii, Australia, and
parts of Africa. YLD is now considered a syndrome with at least 2 pathogen
factors, SCYLV and a phytoplasma (see previous ProMED-mail post no.
20080303.0869 for more information), involved. Symptoms may be confined to
a few patches or spread out over up to 100 per cent of a field. They
include drying of the plants, overall loss of crop vigour, and premature
death of canes. A yield loss of up to 95 per cent has been recorded for
some cultivars.

SCYLV appears to be associated with the disease in many regions. The virus
was recently assigned to the genus _Polerovirus_ of the family
_Luteoviridae_. It is spread by infected sugarcane cuttings and several
aphid vectors (mostly the sugarcane aphid _Melanaphis sacchari_).
_Saccharum_ species are the only known natural hosts of SCYLV, however,
experimental aphid transmission to some other _Poaeceae_ has been reported.
SCYLV is a variable virus, and several genotypes varying in virulence have
been described. Use of resistant cane varieties appears the most promising
means to control yellow leaf in the field.

YLD was the most studied disease of sugarcane during the last decade, but
questions as to the involvement of different pathogens in different regions
remain to be answered.
