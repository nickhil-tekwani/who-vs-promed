Two people have contracted potentially-fatal eastern equine encephalitis in
Louisiana but the outbreak appears to be easing. State epidemiologists say
the two unidentified victims are being treated as researchers try to find
[where they became infected. So far, 87 horses, some sheep and emus have
also tested positive but experts say the number of horses is probably
double the confirmed cases.

[How a cluster of two cases can occur and be "easing" at the same time is a
wonder. I do not know what "tested positive" means; antibody or virus
isolation. Has anyone ever heard of a sheep being naturally infected and
sick with eastern equine encephalitis? I wouldn't doubt it, just never
heard of it. - Mod.CHC
