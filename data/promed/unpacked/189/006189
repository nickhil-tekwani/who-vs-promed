There are now 4 cases positive for [a] hantavirus [infection] in the Los Rios region during this summer season [2012] and during March. These include a 5-year-old girl in the Lanco community, a 48-year-old man in the Valdivia coastal area, and 2 people from Santiago who were vacationing in the Panguipulli community in February.

The chief of the Epidemiology Unit of the Health SEREMI [regional governmental ministerial unit], Claudia Campillo, refers to the last confirmed hantavirus [infection] cases in Los Rios. She mentioned that the hantavirus has a maximum incubation period of approximately 45 days, following initiation of the infection.

The Public Health chief mentioned that among the recommendations to take into account when camping or taking recreational trips are: select areas that are clean of brush and weeds; use a tent with a floor, closed, and without holes; keep food in closed, rodent-resistant containers; do not leave pots and cooking utensils within reach of rodents; walk only on established trails; and keep trash and garbage in closed containers and, if necessary, bury them.

[Although not specified, the hantavirus involved in these cases is most likely Andes virus.

The Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services have confirmed cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in both Cascade and Flathead counties. The agency did not release any information on those with the illness, including whether they were hospitalized or had recovered.

The cases bring to 35 the number reported in Montana since 1993. There have been 3 so far this year [2012].

Hantavirus cases often increase as people begin to clean their garages and sheds in the warmer spring weather. Cleaning can disturb nesting materials contaminated with dried saliva, urine, or droppings from infected deer mice [_Peromyscus maniculatus_], which are inhaled, causing exposure to the virus.

The illness usually starts with flu-like symptoms, including fever, sore muscles, and headaches. It progresses to a severe shortness of breath. Early diagnoses and treatment increase the likelihood of full recovery.

[The hantavirus most likely involved is Sin Nombre virus.

The Montana Department of Public Health & Human Services has confirmed a case of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in a Cascade County resident.

This is one of 34 HPS cases reported in Montana since 1993; Montana typically sees 1 to 2 cases a year with this being the 2nd in 2012.

In a press release, the Cascade City-County Health Department (CCHD) reminds people that there are steps they can take to protect themselves against infection from [a] hantavirus [infection].

Alicia Thompson, the CCHD health officer, said, "Many people are eager to begin spring cleaning of their garages, sheds, barns, or decide to make that 1st trip of the season to the cabin. It is important that people know what steps they can take to protect themselves against [a] hantavirus [infection]."

Hantavirus [infection] cases often increase as people begin to clean their garages and sheds in the warmer spring weather. Cleaning activities can disturb nesting materials contaminated with dried saliva, urine, or droppings from infected deer mice [_Peromyscus maniculatus_]. The disturbed nesting materials become airborne and the air is inhaled causing an exposure to the virus. This exposure leads to a hantavirus infection. A person might also be infected with [a] hantavirus if contaminated materials are directly introduced into broken skin or into the eyes or mouth.

Symptoms can begin 1-6 weeks after becoming infected with the virus. The illness typically starts with 3-5 days of "flu-like" symptoms including fever, sore muscles, headaches, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. Within a few days the illness rapidly progresses to severe shortness of breath. Early diagnosis of a hantavirus [infection] and immediate medical care increase the likelihood of a full recovery. Individuals exposed to rodents or their waste who experience symptoms should immediately seek medical treatment and notify their provider that they have been around rodents or rodent wastes. Giving this information to your provider will help him or her to look closely for any rodent-carried disease, such as [a] hantavirus [infection].

The best way to prevent hantavirus transmission is by controlling rodent populations in areas where you live and work.
- Seal up cracks and gaps in buildings that are larger than 1/4 inch [5 mm], including window and door sills, under sinks around the pipes, in foundations, attics, and any rodent entry hole.
- Trap indoor rats and mice with snap traps, and remove rodent food sources.
- Keep food (including pet food) in rodent-proof containers.

If you find places where rodents have nested, or if you find rodent droppings or waste, follow these steps to help to prevent exposure to [a] hantavirus while cleaning:
- Wear rubber or plastic gloves.
- Thoroughly spray/soak area with a disinfectant or mixture of bleach and water to reduce dry dusty conditions in the area being cleaned (visit http://www.cdc.gov/rodents/cleaning/index.html
- Wipe or mop the area with a sponge or paper towel (throw away items after use).
- Wash hands thoroughly with soap and warm water after removing gloves.
- Never sweep or vacuum in these areas as this can stir up dust and aerosolize the droppings.

This year [2012], 3 people in Colorado have tested positive for [a] hantavirus infection, and state officials are warning about the dangers of rodents passing the disease [virus] to humans.

Colorado Public Radio reported Monday [9 Apr 2012] the latest human case occurred late last month when a Delta County man was bitten by a rodent and hospitalized.

State veterinarian Elisabeth Lawaczeck says the virus can also be passed to humans by inhaling rodent feces. She says rodent droppings should be wetted down and wiped up and not vacuumed or swept.

Hantavirus [infection causes] a respiratory disease. It's rare but the mortality rate is high. Nationwide, 36 per cent of people who contract [a] hantavirus [infection] die from it.
