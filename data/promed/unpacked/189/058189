Comment on the Lassa Fever situation in Freetown
-------------------------------------------------
ProMED-mail on 6 Jul 2000 reported that a traveller from a Lassa fever
epidemic zone, who had returned to Freetown, his two cousins, and the
doctor who cared for him, all died of an acute febrile illness with
hemorrhagic features and terminal multi-system failure, clinically
compatible with Lassa fever.
UPDATE: Lassa fever in Freetown is extremely unusual. After an outbreak
investigation and contact tracing, 77 contacts, including family members
and hospital workers, are being followed with recording of body
temperature twice daily and monitoring for symptoms. So far two nurses
have developed fever, in both cases found to be due to malaria.
Surveillance of contacts will continue for 21 days (the upper limit of
the incubation period). Lassa fever guidelines for prevention and case
management developed by WHO and the NGO MERLIN have been widely
distributed.
Contrary to newspaper reports, there have been no confirmed cases in IDP
camps. Because the rat of genus _Mastomys_, the animal vector, is not
indigenous to Freetown, it is unlikely that the disease will become
established here.
Any questions are welcome.

clarification of the current situation with regard to Lassa fever in

develops or resolves. - Mod.CP
