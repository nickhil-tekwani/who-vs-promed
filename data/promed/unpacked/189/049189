There have been 780 confirmed cases of monkeypox in countries where the virus is not usually found, the World Health Organization says. That is roughly triple the 257 cases it reported a week ago. It says the figure -- for the past 3 weeks -- is probably an underestimate and assesses the global risk level as "moderate".

The infection is usually mild, but this is the first time it has spread widely outside Central and West Africa.

The WHO said cases had been identified in 27 countries where it is not already "endemic" -- meaning places it is expected to be found. Most of these new cases are in Europe and North America as well as small numbers in Mexico, Argentina, Morocco, and the United Arab Emirates. The UK has the most cases, with 207, followed by Spain with 156, and Portugal with 138.

In its latest update, the WHO said some countries were reporting that new cases were appearing beyond known contacts of previously confirmed cases, which it said suggested chains of transmission were being "missed through undetected circulation of the virus."

"It is highly likely that other countries will identify cases and there will be further spread of the virus," it added.

While the current risk to human health for the general public "remains low", the public health risk could "become high" if the virus becomes widespread in countries where it is not normally found, it said. No deaths have been reported as a result of the current outbreak.

The global health body said most, but not all, of the reported cases so far have involved men who have sex with men. There is no evidence that monkeypox is sexually transmitted, but it is passed on through close contact.

The organisation said many cases were not presenting with the typical clinical picture for monkeypox, with some describing pustules appearing before symptoms such as fever.

Most cases of the virus clear up on their own within a few weeks. Symptoms include fever, headaches, swellings, back pain, aching muscles, as well as a rash that goes through different stages. Monkeypox can sometimes be more severe, however, and has been reported to have caused deaths in West Africa in the past.

[4] USA: undetected spread
Date: Fri 3 Jun 2022

https://sports.yahoo.com/officials-2-monkeypox-strains-us-172913305.html


Genetic analysis of recent monkeypox cases suggests there are 2 distinct strains in the US, health officials said [Fri 3 Jun 2022], raising the possibility that the virus has been circulating undetected for some time.

Many of the US cases were caused by the same strain as recent cases in Europe, but a few samples show a different strain, federal health officials said. Each strain had been seen in US cases last year [2021] before the recent international outbreak was identified.

Analysis from many more patients will be needed to determine how long monkeypox has been circulating in the US and elsewhere, said Jennifer McQuiston of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

"I think it's certainly possible that there could have been monkeypox cases in the United States that went under the radar previously but not to any great degree," she told reporters Friday [3 Jun 2022]. However, she added, "there could be community-level transmission that is happening" in parts of the US where the virus has not yet been identified.

The CDC said it is trying to increase its work on finding infections, and it's likely more cases will be reported.

The findings mean the outbreak likely will be difficult to contain, said Dr. Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan. "It's not clear how long infections have been happening, and where. Some infections may have been misdiagnosed as something else. "We don't really have a good sense of how many cases there are out there," Rasmussen said.

Monkeypox is endemic in parts of Africa, where people have been infected through bites from rodents or small animals. It does not usually spread easily among people.

But last month [May 2022], cases began emerging in Europe and the United States. Many -- but not all -- of those who contracted the virus had traveled internationally, and health officials in a growing number of countries are investigating.

As of [Fri 3 Jun 2022], the US had identified at least 20 cases in 11 states. Hundreds of other cases have been found in other countries, many apparently tied to sexual activity at 2 recent raves in Europe.

On [Sat 4 Jun 2022], the DC Public Health Lab confirmed the first positive _Orthopoxvirus_ case in a District resident who reported recent travel to Europe. The collected samples have been sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for further testing and confirmation of the Monkeypox virus. Monkeypox is in the _Orthopox_ family of viruses.

The patient is currently isolated and does not pose a risk to the public. DC Health is identifying and monitoring close contacts, however, at this time no additional cases have been identified in the District.

On [26 May 2022], DC Health issued a Health Notice for District of Columbia Health Care Providers with clinical recommendations and reporting requirements for any suspected cases.

The Biden administration has distributed 1200 monkeypox vaccine doses for people who have had high-risk exposures to the virus, part of a nationwide public health response to stamp out the disease before it causes a major outbreak.

US health officials worried the virus is spreading faster than previously thought, have said the global outbreak of monkeypox is the largest ever. The World Health Organization said on [Wed 1 Jun 2022] that there are now more than 550 cases across 30 countries. In the US, at least 20 confirmed or suspected cases have been reported in 11 states, including California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Utah, and Washington state, according to the CDC. [now 31 cases in 14 states. - Mod.TY]

"A monkeypox outbreak of this scale and scope across the world, has not been seen before," Dr. Raj Panjabi, who leads the White House pandemic preparedness office, told reporters on a call last week.

However, CDC officials have sought to reassure the public that the arrival of monkeypox in the US is vastly different from COVID-19, which blindsided the country 2 years ago. Scientists knew little about COVID-19 when it first emerged and the US had no vaccines or antiviral treatments to fight the virus in 2020.

Monkeypox, on the other hand, has been known to scientists since 1958 when the virus was first identified during outbreaks among monkeys kept for research purposes, and its transmission in humans has been studied since the 1970s. Global health authorities also have extensive experience successfully fighting smallpox, which the World Health Organization declared eradicated in 1980 after a successful global vaccination effort. Monkeypox is in the same virus family as smallpox though it is much milder.

Stockpiling vaccine
-------------------
CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told reporters last week that the US has been preparing for an outbreak from a virus like monkeypox for decades. The US has millions of vaccine doses in the strategic national stockpile that protect against monkeypox and smallpox as well as antiviral pills to treat the diseases.

Dawn O'Connell, who leads the Health and Human Services office responsible for the strategic national stockpile, said on [Fri 3 Jun 2022] that the US has enough vaccine on hand to manage the current monkeypox outbreak. However, O'Connell would not disclose how many shots the US has at the ready.

The US has 2 vaccines but the preferred option is in shorter supply. Jynneos is a 2-dose vaccine approved by the FDA in 2019 to prevent monkeypox in people ages 18 and older. The CDC generally recommends Jynneos over the other option, ACAM2000, which is an older generation smallpox vaccine that can have serious side effects.

Last week, CDC official Dr. Jennifer McQuiston said the US has 1000 doses of Jynneos available. However, the Danish biotech company that makes the shots, Bavarian Nordic, said the US actually has a supply of more than 1 million Jynneos frozen doses stored in the US and Denmark under an order placed in April [2020]. The shots have a shelf life of 3 years.

The US has ordered close to 30 million Jynneos doses since [2010] but 28 million of them expired, the spokesperson said. Bavarian Nordic plans to increase production this summer and has the capacity to produce 30 million shots a year, the spokesperson said.

The US government also has a stockpile of more than 100 million doses of ACAM2000, made by Emergent BioSolutions, McQuiston told reporters last week. The US had released 500 doses of Jynneos and 200 doses of ACAM2000 as of [Tue 31 May 2022], according to the CDC. The US has also sent out 100 courses of the oral antiviral tecovirimat to the states, health officials said [Fri 3 Jun 2022]."We want to ensure that people with high-risk exposures have rapid access to vaccines and if they become sick, can receive appropriate treatment," Panjabi said on a call with reporters [Fri 3 Jun 2022]. Jynneos and ACAM2000 can be administered before or after exposure to the virus. However, patients need to receive the vaccines within 4 days of exposure to prevent disease onset.

ACAM2000 has demonstrated high levels of protection against monkeypox in animal models and is expected to provide 85% protection against disease from the virus similar to earlier versions of smallpox vaccines, according to Mike Slifka, an immunologist at Oregon Health and Science University who has studied monkeypox. Less is known about Jynneos because the vaccine is newer but it produced reasonable antibody levels in humans and should protect against severe disease, Slifka said.

Side effects
------------
The CDC generally recommends Jynneos over ACAM2000 because it is considered safer. ACAM2000 can have serious side effects, and distributing the vaccine widely would require serious discussion, McQuiston said in a call with reporters last week.

ACAM2000 uses a mild virus strain in the same family as monkeypox and smallpox that can still replicate, which means there's a risk that the live virus in the vaccine can spread in the human body or to other people.

ACAM2000 is administered with a 2-pronged needle that is scratched into the upper arm and the virus then grows into a localized infection in the form of a blister. The patient can potentially spread the virus to other people, or to other parts of their body if they scratch the blister and then rub their eye for example, which can result in vision damage. The FDA warns that it's very important for people vaccinated with ACAM2000 to take proper care of the vaccination site so they don't spread the virus to other people or other parts of the body.

CDC warning
-----------
The CDC has said women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, people with weak immune systems, those with skin conditions such as eczema or atopic dermatitis, and people with heart disease should not receive ACAM2000. In pregnant women, the virus can spread to the fetus and cause stillbirth. People with weak immune systems face a risk that the virus will grow uncontrollably and cause a dangerous infection, Slifka said. People with skin conditions such as eczema or atopic dermatitis are also at risk of the virus spreading on their skin which can turn into a life-threatening infection, he said.

The Jynneos vaccine, on the other hand, is not associated with these risks because it uses a virus strain that is no longer able to replicate in humans, according to Slifka. It is also administered with a normal syringe like other common shots such as the flu vaccine.

Given the potential side effects of ACAM2000, the vaccine would likely only see wide use in the context of a major smallpox epidemic because that virus is so deadly, according to Dr. Peter Hotez, an infectious disease and vaccine expert at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas. Monkeypox, on the other hand, is a much milder virus and no deaths have been reported in the recent cases in Europe and North America.

Mortality rate
--------------
Smallpox can have a fatality rate as high as 30%, according to the WHO. The West African strain of monkeypox that appears to be driving the current outbreak likely has a mortality rate somewhere around 1%, though data is sparse because the virus has previously spread mostly in remote parts of Africa. Most people recover within 2-4 weeks without specific medical treatment, according to the CDC. There's another monkeypox strain, Congo Basin, associated with a higher death rate of 3% to 10%, according to the WHO.

"We're very lucky that the outbreak right is the low virulence West African strain," said Dr. Rachel Roper, a professor of microbiology and immunology at East Carolina University who has studied monkeypox.

Though the US has far more tools and more knowledge to fight monkeypox than it had against COVID-19 in 2020, there are still many unknowns about the current outbreak. It's unclear why the virus is now spreading in countries outside West and Central Africa where virus is endemic. Historically, the virus spread in small villages in Africa by jumping from rodents that carry the virus to humans with very little transmission between people, Slifka said. However, the virus now appears to be spreading better between people, he said.

"Through intimate contact and skin-to-skin transmission, it's transmitting better than it has under other circumstances," Slifka said.

Most monkeypox patients in the US travelled internationally in the 21 days before symptom onset which suggests they picked up the virus outside the country, according to McQuiston. The CDC doesn't believe monkeypox is spreading widely in the U.S right now but is closely monitoring the situation. The US has conducted 120 tests so far for _Orthopoxvirus_, the family that includes monkeypox.

Community transmission
----------------------
"There could be community-level transmission that is happening, and that's why we want to really increase our surveillance efforts," McQuiston told reporters during a call on [Fri 3 Jun 2022]. "We want to really encourage physicians that if they see a rash and they're concerned it might be monkeypox to go ahead and test for that," she said.

WHO officials said on [Wed 1 Jun 2022] that the sudden appearance of monkeypox in multiple countries in North America and Europe indicates that the virus has probably been spreading outside West and Central Africa undetected for some time, though it is unclear for how long. Dr. Rosamund Lewis, the WHO's technical lead for monkeypox, said the virus may be spreading more now because immunity in the human population has waned since smallpox vaccination was halted after the disease was eradicated.

Lewis said the WHO is not recommending mass vaccination against monkeypox because the current outbreak can still be contained. Most of the cases so far have been reported among men who have sex with men, developed symptoms, and sought care at sexual health clinics, according to the WHO. Lewis said it is important to provide gay and bisexual men with the information they need to protect themselves from the virus and prevent it from spreading.

[Containing monkeypox spread depends on timely surveillance for case finding and contact identification. Finding cases promptly will require collaboration by individuals in communities most at risk. Because the majority of cases have occurred among men who have sex with men, there is a significant risk of those men becoming stigmatized. In a 5 Jun 2022 editorial in The Guardian https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jun/05/the-guardian-view-on-monkeypox-communication-is-crucial, it states that "monkeypox, is an unpleasant but, for most people, not a fatal blistering disease caused by a virus that is common in parts of west and central Africa, but has only recently made its way in significant numbers to regions where it is not endemic. It has been recorded in at least 20 countries in the past month, from the Americas to Europe and Australia, with cases recently confirmed in Wales and Scotland, as well as England.

"If it continues to spread, it will put yet more pressure on hard-pressed health services. Efficient management in the community is vital, with people unafraid to come forward if they believe they are infected [or have been exposed]. Language has an important role to play, with the UN's Aids agency warning last month that racist and homophobic rhetoric risks stigmatising the disease and undermining the response."

Avoidance of MPX virus transmission hot spots will require the community most at risk to know how to avoid those risks. In a statement published in Pink News, the LGB Alliance stated, "Monkeypox is spreading and gay and bisexual men have been affected disproportionately. That is why we call for the urgent closure of all strip clubs, saunas, massage parlours, fetish events, and clubs with dark rooms... whatever the sexual orientation of the clientele," it added in an open letter. - Mod.LXL].

["Though in the UK the LGB Alliance said it was calling for all commercial sex venues "regardless of clientele" to close, many pointed out that the UK's dark rooms, saunas and leather bars cater almost, if not entirely, exclusively to homosexual men. https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2022/05/31/lgb-alliance-monkeypox-twitter/.

This information communicated by Roland Hübner (<roland.hubner@health.fgov.be>)
and Mary Marshall (<mjm2020@googlemail.com>).

Clearly, an effective education effort aimed at this vulnerable community to encourage participation, rather than hide, is necessary to effectively slow and then halt transmission among its members. There is no better time to launch this effort than during the gay pride activities going on currently. - Mod.TY]

Monkeypox in Multiple Countries
Alert-level 2 Practice Enhanced Precautions

Key points
----------
- Cases of monkeypox have been reported in Europe, North America, South America, Africa, Asia, and Australia (see full list of countries below). Some cases were reported among men who have sex with men. Some cases were also reported in people who live in the same household as an infected person.

- Many of these people have not recently been in central or west African countries where monkeypox usually occurs, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Nigeria, among others.

- Travelers should:
- Avoid close contact with sick people, including those with skin lesions or genital lesions.
- Avoid contact with dead or live wild animals such as small mammals including rodents (rats, squirrels) and non-human primates (monkeys, apes).
- Avoid eating or preparing meat from wild game (bushmeat) or using products derived from wild animals from Africa (creams, lotions, powders).
- Avoid contact with contaminated materials used by sick people (such as clothing, bedding, or materials used in healthcare settings) or that came into contact with infected animals.

- Risk to the general public is low, but you should seek medical care immediately if you develop new, unexplained skin rash (lesions on any part of the body), with or without fever and chills, and avoid contact with others. If possible, call ahead before going to a healthcare facility. If you are not able to call ahead, tell a staff member as soon as you arrive that you are concerned about monkeypox. Tell your doctor if in the month before developing symptoms:
- You had contact with a person that might have had monkeypox.
- You are a man who has had intimate contact (including sex) with other men.
- You were in an area where monkeypox has been reported (currently, Europe, North America, Australia) or in an area where monkeypox is more commonly found (the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of the Congo, Nigeria, Central African Republic, Cameroon, Côte d'Ivoire, Gabon, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Sudan).

- If you are sick and could have monkeypox, delay travel by public transportation until you have been cleared by a healthcare professional or public health officials.

Australia has recorded its 5th case of Monkeypox in a returned Victorian traveller who had visited Europe. The man, aged in his 30s, developed mild symptoms after returning to Melbourne and sought medical attention.

Testing has confirmed he has the virus, and he remains in isolation at home with mild symptoms, a statement from the Department of Health said. A small number of contacts will be asked to monitor for symptoms, it added.

It's the 2nd case of confirmed monkeypox in Victoria since the first was identified in Melbourne last month [May 2022] and the 5th in the country.

Yesterday [Thu 2 Jun 2022], a man in his 50s who recently arrived from Europe was identified as the 3rd case of monkeypox in NSW.

NSW has confirmed its 4th, and identified a probable 5th, case of monkeypox.

There are 2 men in their 30s who recently returned from Europe, had travelled together, and developed symptoms after landing in Sydney. One of the men has been confirmed to have monkeypox while NSW Health says the other man probably also infectious. They are both isolating at home.

Tracing is being conducted but so far, no high-risk contacts have been identified. The 2 men are not connected to the 3 previous cases reported in the state so far.

NSW Health says monkeypox does not pose a threat of transmission in the general community. It is generally spread through close contact. Monkeypox is endemic in some parts of Africa but a number of cases have been reported in several countries around the world over the past month.

In Australia, 6 cases have so far been confirmed. Victoria confirmed its 2nd case on [Fri 3 Jun 2022] in a man in his 30s who had returned from the UK.

A male traveller who had transited through Singapore en route to Australia was diagnosed with monkeypox.

However, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said in a media statement on [Mon 6 Jun 2022] that there is currently no significant risk of community transmission of the virus in Singapore, as the traveller did not enter the city-state nor interact with persons in the community.

The ministry said that it was informed by the New South Wales Ministry of Health of the confirmed monkeypox case on [Sat 4 May 2022].

The traveller had transited through Singapore on [Thu 2 Jun 2022], arrived in Sydney on [Fri 3 Jun 2022], and had tested positive for monkeypox there. He had previously departed from Barcelona on [Wed 1 Jun 2022]."

Upon arrival at Changi Airport on [Thu 2 Jun 2022], the traveller had remained in the transit holding area until his departure for Sydney on the same day and did not visit other areas in the airport.

As a precautionary measure, MOH said that it has conducted contact tracing for the 2 affected flights and those who might have come into contact with the traveller at the airport transit area.

It assessed that there were no close contacts, and hence no requirement for quarantine. However, 13 persons who may have had casual contact with the traveller were put on phone surveillance for 21 days.

These persons will receive daily phone calls to ascertain their health status. Should they report symptoms that are suggestive of monkeypox infection, they will be medically assessed and may be conveyed to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases for further evaluation.

Monkeypox is a rare disease that causes a rash that spreads, fever, chills and aches, among other symptoms. Generally confined to western and central Africa, cases have been reported in Europe since May [2022] and the number of countries affected has grown since.

Singapore reported its first case of monkeypox in [2019], from a 38-year-old Nigerian who arrived in the city-state alone. He recovered and left Singapore.

The first suspected case of monkeypox in India was detected in a 5-year-old child in Uttar Pradesh's Ghaziabad.

The girl's sample was collected for monkeypox testing, the chief medical officer (CMO) of Ghaziabad told news agency ANI. He said it was a precautionary measure, as she complained of itching and rashes on her body. "She has no other health issues and neither she nor any of her close contact traveled abroad in the past month" he was quoted by ANI.

The symptoms of monkeypox typically begin with a flu-like illness and swelling of the lymph nodes, followed by a rash on the face and body.

[This case has not been confirmed by laboratory tests. This is an essential step to differentiate monkeypox from chickenpox (varicella-zoster virus infection). Clinically, usually, the rash of chickenpox is itchy and the rash of monkeypox is painful. ProMED requests information about the results of laboratory tests when they become available. - Mod.TY]
