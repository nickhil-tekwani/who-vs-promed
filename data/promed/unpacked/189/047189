Plum pox potyvirus detected near Chatham, ON; origin a mystery
----------------------------------------------------------------
HAMILTON - Canadian officials are rethinking their theory that the plum pox
virus came to Canada solely from Pennsylvania. Blake Ferguson of the
Canadian Food Inspection Agency confirmed yesterday that the virus has been
found in peach trees at Blenheim, on the north shore of Lake Erie near
Chatham. None of the trees came from the United States.
It's the first time the virus has been found outside Niagara, said
Ferguson, who is helping co-ordinate the agency's national strategy for
identification and eradication. "It points to the fact it's been around
longer than we had originally assumed. It may not have arrived from
Pennsylvania." As of yesterday there have been 510 positive tests for the D
strain of the virus, out of 37 412 samples.
Officials are concerned that an infected tree might have been smuggled into
Canada. But how the virus got to Blenheim is a mystery. Ferguson said
Canada's records are very good on imported plants, making tracking of legal
stock simple. But a plant smuggled from outside Canada cannot be traced.
Ferguson also said it's possible the disease, originally from Europe, has
been here longer than we know. It may have been undetected for some time on
a non-farm operation, where owners were not concerned about the quality of
fruit.
Ferguson said it's probable that some varieties of fruit trees will be less
likely to get the disease, and some will be more susceptible. Future work
will look at breeding trees that are highly resistant to the virus. U.S.
researchers already have developed resistant strains through genetic
alteration and are testing them in Europe where the disease originated.

[If true, then this is a major setback in managing this disease. I am not
surprised that the virus may have already been in Canada for a period of
time. I once saw a tourist at Schipol Airport stuffing plantlets into
plastic bags which he then put into his pockets. Upon my telling him that
he would likely be interrogated by USDA officials at New York, he mumbled
something about "mind your own business!"
Plum pox potyvirus was initially discovered in nectarines imported into
Canada from a nursery in Pennsylvania two years ago but subsequent tests of
that nursery by American scientists failed to detect the virus. It is
likely that the infected trees were shipped out in the normal course of
commerce before the survey was made. -Mod.DH
