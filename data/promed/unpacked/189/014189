[1] Cholera - Congo DR (Bukavu)

A fresh cholera outbreak is threatening the lives of thousands of people in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The waterborne epidemic has struck South Kivu, capital of Bukavu Province, which has a population of over 4.5 million people. More than 1600 confirmed cases with at least 14 deaths have been reported since last week. Last year, nearly 19 000 cases were also reported with more than 200 deaths from another cholera outbreak.

Factors such as poor hygiene and little access to safe drinking water contribute to the outbreaks. Over the past few years, Congo has faced numerous problems such as grinding poverty, crumbling infrastructure, and a war in the east of the country that has dragged on for more than a decade.

MSF teams treated over 12 000 people for cholera, around 75 per cent of cases in Chad, during 2011's large-scale outbreak. More than 450 people died and 17 200 cases of the disease were reported in 2011, numbers that have not been seen since 1996.

At the height of the epidemic in August, up to 1250 new cases per week were recorded, a third of those in the capital city of N'Djamena.

Medecins Sans Frontieres MSF (Doctors Without Borders) mobilized more than 325 national and international staff at 23 health care centers in Massakory, Am Timan, Abou Deia, Mandelia, Pala, Fianga, Lere, Lai, Bongor, and N'Djamena.

"The outbreak was a continuation of the 2010 epidemic. It never really ended, therefore we witnessed two events: cases before the rainy season, and a wide geographical spread. 37 out of 61 districts were affected," says Michel-Olivier Lacharit√©, head of MSF programs in Chad.

In 2010, MSF treated more than 6800 cases of cholera in the country.

[3] Cholera - Somalia (refugee camp)

Cholera outbreak has claimed the lives of at least 25 more children in Somalia as the humanitarian situation continues to worsen in the famine-stricken country, Press TV reports.

According to medical sources in the Dolo Ado refugee camp near the Ethiopia-Somalia border, at least 25 children died of cholera Wednesday morning and 278 more children are on the verge of death.

Cholera is confirmed in Banadir, Bay, Mudug, and Lower Shabelle regions of Somalia, and the number of acute diarrhea cases has increased dramatically in the last few months.

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) warned on 28 Sep 2011 that the humanitarian situation remains "highly critical" in Somalia. According to the United Nations, drought, high food prices and fighting in Somalia have increased the number of those in need of humanitarian assistance across the Horn of Africa to 13.3 million.

Health authorities in Albay have placed the province under close watch for cholera after 3 people died early in January 2012 due to the food-and-water-borne disease. Dr Luis Mendoza, the provincial health officer, revealed that Albay recorded 7 cases of cholera in December 2011. Mendoza said 5 of the 7 cases recorded in December were from Daraga town, 1 from Ligao City and 1 from Legazpi.

Early in January 2012, however, health authorities became more concerned when 3 people died of cholera in Barangay Gapo, Daraga.

Mendoza said that because the cases reported were from sporadic areas, the provincial health workers were closely monitoring and accounting for possible additional cases.

[How many of the other cases of enteric illness reported are also due to _Vibrio cholerae_ is unclear. Pondicherry, in the south of India as can be seen at the URL (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pondicherry>) since 2006 officially Puducherry, is a Union Territory of India. It is a former French colony, consisting of four non-contiguous enclaves, or districts, and named for the largest, Pondicherry. In September 2006, the territory changed its official name from Pondicherry to Puducherry, which means "new village" in the Tamil language. It is also known as "The French Riviera of the East" (La Cote d'Azur de l'Est). - Mod.LL
