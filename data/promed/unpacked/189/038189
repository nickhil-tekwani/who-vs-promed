Within the framework of the epidemiological surveillance of the novel coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the Ministry of Health (MOH) has announced that 5 novel coronavirus cases have been recorded among citizens in the Eastern Region, ranging in age from 73 to 85 years, but they all have chronic diseases.

[These new cases raise the global number of cases to 49, with 23 fatalities (see report below). From the wording of the report, it appears as though these cases are considered to be part of the ongoing outbreak in Al-Ahsa, albeit more specific details on possible location of transmission (in hospital vs contact of cases, vs community acquired without knowledge of actual contact) of confirmed cases would be helpful to understand the epidemiology of these cases.

As with prior cases in this outbreak in the Eastern Province, the individuals all have a history of pre-existing co-morbidities.

Coronavirus death reported in France
------------------------------------
A patient infected with the novel coronavirus has died in France, according to the health ministry. The virus, which is similar to those which cause SARS and the common cold, emerged last year [2012].

Out of 44 [now 49 according to the report above from the Ministry of Public Health, Saudi Arabia. - Mod.MPP] confirmed cases around the world, 23 people have now died with most infections linked to travel to the Middle East. The virus causes pneumonia and, sometimes, organ failure. Most patients have had other health problems.

The 65 year old, who had been travelling in Dubai, died in hospital on Tuesday [28 May 2013]. Another patient who shared a hospital room with the man has caught the infection.

Cases have been reported in Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, France, Germany, Tunisia, and the UK. Half of the 44 cases reported have been in Saudi Arabia.

In a statement earlier in May [2013], the World Health Organization said: "The greatest global concern, however, is about the potential for this new virus to spread.

"This is partly because the virus has already caused severe disease in multiple countries, although in small numbers, and has persisted in the [Middle East] region since 2012.

"Of most concern, however, is the fact that the different clusters seen in multiple countries increasingly support the hypothesis that when there is close contact this novel coronavirus can transmit from person to person."

In February [2013], a patient died in a hospital in Birmingham, in the UK, after 3 members of the same family became infected. It is thought a family member had picked up the virus while travelling to the Middle East and Pakistan.

Prof Ian Jones, a virologist at the University of Reading, said the death was tragic, but the risks of infection were low. "It is very rare and apart from the unusual circumstances of very close containment with already hospitalised persons, it does not seem to transfer among people. As a result, the overall risk remains very low and the most pressing need is to identify where the virus is coming from so that these occasional infections can be prevented."

[This now raises the total number of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection related fatalities to 23 out of 49 confirmed cases. Resulting in a case fatality rate of 47 per cent.

As reminded by subscriber Raymond Weinstein, MD:
"This report makes me wonder if the calculated mortality rate might be artificially elevated because of an underestimated denominator. How many cases are not counted because they are mild or subclinical, the patients never seeking medical care? The serious cases are self selecting for being counted because they quickly get into the medical system, but I suspect that may not be so for the mild cases."

Until there is a good test (or tests) that permit identification of mild infections, it is likely that milder cases are being "missed" and we will continue to observe higher case fatality rates.
