A botulism scare that damaged New Zealand's international reputation for providing top quality and safe dairy products was likely a false alarm. New Zealand government officials said Wednesday, 28 Aug 2013, they had found no sign of the botulism bacterium after retesting ingredients used in recalled milk products.

Dairy company Fonterra sparked a global recall of infant formula earlier in August 2013 after announcing it had discovered the presence of the botulism bacterium in some of its whey protein concentrate. But New Zealand's Ministry of Primary Industries announced Wednesday, 28 Aug 2013, that its own extensive retesting of the concentrate indicated the presence of another, less dangerous type of bacterium but not the botulism bacterium.

Officials said the bacterium they found poses no health risk but could spoil the product in high quantities. Officials sought to reassure international markets by lifting their own warnings about affected Fonterra products. Several countries have instituted limited bans on New Zealand dairy products.

New Zealand officials said they conducted 195 tests in laboratories in New Zealand and the USA. They concluded that the bacterium in the whey concentrate was _Clostridium sporogenes_, and not the _Clostridium botulinum_ initially identified by Fonterra's tests.

[This could be a case of misidentification of _Clostridium_ species but, in fact, _C. sporogenes cannot be distinguished from the Group I _C. botulinum_ without toxin assay (1). Infections due to this non-toxin producing organism are rare (2,3) but it can be used as a surrogate organism for _C. botulinum_ (4,5). If it is present, then conditions were not appropriate for the eradication of botulinum spores. Given this, this moderator is not convinced that the whey concentrate is truly safe.
