An outbreak of Mayaro fever has been detected. For the 1st time,
massive [numbers] of infections by this zoonosis have been detected
in the country. For the 1st time in Venezuela, a massive outbreak of
this zoonosis was registered in the municipality of Ospino de
Portuguesa; 69 people have been affected.

This epidemiological information was reported in Alert No. 132 of the
Venezuelan Medical Societies Network. According to the explanations
in this document, it discusses a disease similar to dengue, not
fatal, but the consequences of which can last for months. What makes
Mayaro fever serious, and the real difference from dengue, is that it
can appear with arthritis, causing strong inflammation and
arthralgias, even to the point of incapacitation in people for up to
6 months, according to the additional explanation provided by the
infectious disease physician Ana Carvajal.

Which [arthropod] vector transmitted Mayaro fever in Ospinao has not
been determined yet. Although usually it would be a mosquito, the
[possibility] of other animals [arthropods] has not been discarded.
In order to determine [which arthropods are involved], a group of
entomologists from the National Directorate of Environmental Health
of the Ministry of Health are present in the area.

Mayaro [virus] disease develops similar to dengue [virus infections].
It begins with a rapid, high fever, headache, myalgia, retroorbital
pain and joint edema.

The transmission cycle of this disease, more than dengue, is similar
to yellow fever, [being] sylvatic and is believed to be maintained in
primate communities [troops]. According to the Epidemiological Alert,
the zoonosis is caused by an arbovirus of the togavirus family, is
endemic in humid tropical forests in South America such as those in
Trinidad, Surinam, French Guayana, Brazil, Peru, Bolivia y Venezuela,
and is usually transmitted by _Haemagogus_ mosquitoes [which are
major sylvan yellow fever virus vectors - Mod.TY].

The interesting thing about this outbreak in Ospina is that it is the
1st characterized as massive in Venezuela. Although during various
decades Mayaro fever outbreaks have been detected in animals, the 1st
time it was [found] in humans was in 2000. Jaime Torres, a researcher
at the Universidad Central in Venezuela, encountered it in a family
that had camped in the tropical forests of Barlovento, Miranda state.

The 69 affected people on this occasion live in the La Estacion
village in the Ospino municipality in Portuguesa state. The cases
have been formally diagnosed since 4 Feb 2010. Of these patients, 65
percent are women, and 35 percent are men; 49 percent are between 25
and 54 years of age and more than half are housewives and laborers.

The index case was a woman from the La Estacion village, who was
attended to on 29 Jan 2010 in the Guanare Miguel Oraa Hspital, with
characteristic symptoms of the disease and arthritis in multiple
joints that persisted during a month. The patient reported the
existence of other people affected similarly.

Health authorities visited the village on 4 Feb [2010] and found 31
similar cases. Samples were sent, and the diagnosis was corroborated
by the Centro de Investigaciones de Virosis Hemorragicas y
Enfermedades Transmisibles [Center for Hemorrhagic Virus and
Transmissible Disease Research], and this information was issued by
the Ministry of Health.

[Mayaro virus does not cause serious cases, an interesting aspect
along with its persistent arthralgia. In Brazil, [Mayaro virus] cases
occur, however, with the increase in dengue cases, and it is very
likely that Mayaro cases go undiagnosed. - Mod.LJS]

[This focal outbreak illustrates the need for a thorough history
supported by comprehensive laboratory testing for making a
differential diagnosis and finding additional cases.
