Clinical Update: Yellow Fever Vaccine Shortage
----------------------------------------------
The manufacturer of yellow fever vaccine (YF-Vax), Sanofi Pasteur (Swiftwater, PA), has informed CDC that the supply of YF-Vax (the only yellow fever vaccine available in the United States) is currently limited. As a result, the manufacturer has placed limits on orders of the single-dose and 5-dose vials of YF-Vax. These ordering limits are expected to be in place until April 2014.

According to the manufacturer's package insert, all YF-Vax must be used within 1 hour of reconstitution (both single-dose and 5-dose vials). Clinics using the 5-dose vials are advised to schedule patients to efficiently use the available vaccine doses within this 1-hour timeframe.

Health care providers should refer to the section titled Travel Vaccines and Malaria Information, by Country in CDC Health Information for International Travel 2014 (the "Yellow Book") for information about which countries require yellow fever vaccination for entry and for which countries CDC recommends yellow fever vaccination. In the absence of a country requirement, CDC does not recommend yellow fever vaccination if the traveler's itinerary does not include travel to a yellow fever-endemic area.

For further information, contact Sanofi Pasteur customer service at 1-800-VACCINE (1-800-822-2463).

[ProMED has been receiving reports from Canada and other countries about the shortage of yellow fever (YF) vaccine. This is a serious concern given that the winter time is a popular time for people living in cold, temperate areas to escape the cold and travel to tropical climates. Those traveling to YF endemic areas in South America and Africa are at risk of infection if unvaccinated. There is particular concern about those traveling to YF endemic areas in Brazil during the FIFA World cup games. One hopes that the YF vaccine supply will become adequate by the dates of those games, 12 Jun - 13 Jul 2014.

As noted in WHO's yellow fever vaccination requirements and recommendations (http://www.who.int/ith/chapters/ith2012en_countrylist.pdf?ua=1), yellow fever vaccination is "recommended for all travelers 9 months of
age or older going to the following areas: the entire states of Acre, Amapa, Amazonas, Distrito Federal (including the capital city of Brasilia), Goias, Maranhao, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Minas Gerais, Para, Rondonia, Roraima, Tocantins; and designated areas of the following states: Bahia, Parana, Piaui, Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, and Sao Paulo (state). Vaccination is also recommended for travelers visiting Iguazu Falls. Not recommended for travelers whose itineraries are limited to areas not listed above, including the cities of Fortaleza, Recife, Rio de Janeiro, Salvador, and Sao Paulo."

Brazil also considers that there is no risk of yellow fever transmission in the coastal areas of the states of Piaui, Ceara, Rio Grande do Norte, Paraiba, Pernambuco, Alagoas, Sergipe, Bahia, Espirito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Parana, Santa Catarina, and Rio Grande do Sul.

Those planning to attend one or more of the World Cup venues or other YF endemic areas in South America, Darien, Panama or Africa should determine whether they are in the YF risk areas.

*****ATTENTION travelers to the FIFA World Cup 2014 matches in Brazil. You need to be vaccinated at least 10 days before you travel. Don't leave it to the last minute or your designated clinic may have run out!

Although Brazil does NOT require a valid International Certificate of YF Vaccination for entry into the country, it *recommends* vaccination for visitors to several states where matches will be played, e.g.
- Amazonas (venue of an England match)
- Brasilia
- Mato Grosso (Cuiaba)
- Minas Gerais
- Parana (Curitiba)
- Rio Grande do Sul
- Sao Paulo.

CDC recommends in the 2014 edition of their Yellow Book http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/brazil:
"Yellow fever is a risk in certain parts of Brazil, so CDC recommends the yellow fever vaccine for travelers 9 months of age or older to these areas. For more information on this recommendation, see yellow fever recommendations and requirements for Brazil. Your doctor can help you decide if this vaccine is right for you based on your travel plans. For more information, see vaccine recommendations by municipality and state Adobe PDF (in Portuguese; see the legend for English translations)." - Mod.JW]
