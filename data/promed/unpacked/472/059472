No Change in WHO recommended Influenza A/H5N1 Human Vaccine Prototype Strains
-----------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization (WHO) has decided to stick with the
strains of H5N1 avian influenza [virus] it chose in April 2004 for
use in developing human vaccines against the virus, which many fear
will trigger a flu pandemic. The WHO stated today [20 Jul 2005] that
analyses of 2004 and 2005 human and animal strains of H5N1 viruses
from affected countries "did not provide any convincing evidence to
change" the strains previously recommended as vaccine prototypes.
The announcement comes 3 weeks after an international team of
experts, who studied the virus in Viet Nam, reported that it had not
recently improved its ability to spread from birds to humans or from
humans to humans. Their studies, in turn, were prompted by a report
in May 2005 that changing patterns of human cases in northern Viet
Nam, including an increase in case clusters, suggested that the virus
might be becoming more infectious.
The WHO said today [20 Jul 2005] that it would "continue to monitor
the antigenic and genetic changes in circulating A/H5N1 viruses,
especially in humans." It went on to say, "For research purposes, WHO
Collaborating Centres will develop experimental prototype vaccine
strains from recent human influenza A/H5N1 viruses." The US
government has contracted with 2 companies, Sanofi Pasteur and
Chiron, to make prototype H5N1 vaccines. A government-sponsored
clinical trial of the Sanofi vaccine was launched at 3 universities
in March 2005. Sanofi is under contract to make 2 million doses of
vaccine as part of preparations for a possible pandemic.
In other news, the Viet Nam News Service (VNS) stated that Viet Nam
will buy 415 million doses of avian influenza vaccine from China and
the Netherlands for use in poultry. The Chinese vaccine is for the
H5N1 virus, while the Dutch vaccine is for H5N2, a less virulent
strain, the report said. Viet Nam previously announced plans to start
vaccinating poultry in 2 provinces [to commence on 1 Aug 2005] and
will expand the effort to the rest of the country later. Chickens,
ducks, and fighting cocks will be vaccinated, VNS reported. Chickens
and ducks are to receive 3 doses over a period of several months.
Poultry within 3 km of flu outbreaks will receive emergency
inoculations. [See the WHO statement: "Available evidence suggests no
need to change the WHO recommended influenza A/H5N1 vaccine prototype
strains;" at:

[A paper by Choi et al. in J. Virol., 79, 10821-10825, August 2005,
describes characterization of H5N1 influenza viruses isolated from
human infections in Thailand and Viet Nam during 2004, with regard to
their transmissibility to pigs, frequently regarded as an
intermediate mammalian host on the road to evolution of novel
pandemic viruses. All isolates tested were found to replicate in the
respiratory tract of swine, but failed to transmit to contact pigs.
It was concluded that pigs can be infected with highly lethal Asian
H5N1 viruses but that these viruses are not readily transmitted
between pigs under experimental conditions. Another conclusion might
be that the feared pandemic virus has yet to appear, and the vaccine
developers still have time to develop, test and stockpile an H5N1
vaccine suitable and safe for use in humans. - Mod.CP]
