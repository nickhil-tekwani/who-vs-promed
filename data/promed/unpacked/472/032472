3 cases of _E. coli_ intestinal infection have been confirmed among people
who ate at a restaurant here about 2 weeks ago, and up to 10 other people
may have symptoms of the food-borne illness. It could be the largest
outbreak of _E. coli_-caused illness linked to a restaurant in North Dakota
in a decade, said Larry Shireley, the state epidemiologist in Bismarck.
Health officials said the investigation is focused on the Red Lobster
restaurant in Grand Forks, although they have not yet found a definitive
link. The restaurant is cooperating with the investigation. The cases of 3
people who ate at the restaurant on or about 1 Oct 2003, have been
confirmed as _E. coli_ O157:H7, Shireley said.
Between 5 and 10 other cases of people who reported suffering
gastrointestinal symptoms are being investigated, Shireley said. Jim
DeSimone, a spokesman for Florida-based Darden Restaurants, which owns Red
Lobster, said that company officials are cooperating with the health
investigation.
"We regret than anyone is sick," he said. "We have one of the best quality
assurance programs in the industry. This particular restaurant has a
stellar health inspection record. They get top scores. So, we are dealing
with a good restaurant in a good system," DeSimone said.
The city's Health Department monitors food safety at more than 300
facilities, including more than 100 restaurants, schools, nursing homes,
and convenience stores. Officials said Red Lobster has scored high in the
inspections.
Don Shields, director of the Grand Forks Public Health Department, said he
hopes the investigation will be wrapping up within 2 weeks. "If people have
experienced any of these gastrointestinal illnesses, from 28 Sep to 11 Oct
2003, they need to go to their physician," he said.
The state's last restaurant-linked outbreak of _E. coli_ was in 1994, when
14 people fell ill. Health officials traced it to the Wood House restaurant
in Bismarck.

[ProMED awaits the results of the investigation. The Red Lobster
restaurants serve primarily seafood, as one might surmise from the name,
but it would not be surprising if beef or salad winds up as the source. -
