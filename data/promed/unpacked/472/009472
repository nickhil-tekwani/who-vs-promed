The story of Anthrax and the sporadic cases are not new to the Indian
scenario. There are at least a few pockets especially in and around
different wildlife preserves in India where anthrax has been reported, with
deaths of elephants, rhinos, different ungulates, and sometimes even human
beings living in the fringes of the parks and dependent on natural resources.
Although, such outbreaks are sporadic in occurrence as has been classified
by WHOCC (at LSU [based on official returns to OIE, until we can get harder
data -- MHJ), it would be very essential to probe their occurrence, as
many times cases can go undocumented especially with regard to wildlife
mortalities. Vaccinations are not very common and are usually fund-driven.
Additionally, in wildlife protected areas which are classified as
"sanctuaries", grazing rights are allowed, resulting in the movement of
livestock across parks and beyond boundaries, except in crisis situation as
now.
Although, impact of such activities are inapparent, we are very much
sitting on a ticking time-bomb!!! It will need much more than a concerted
effort from veterinary and forest departments in addition to the efforts of
NGOs and people to make a significant impact in taking steps to control the
onslaught of infectious diseases. It needs an awakening about the
importance of wildlife health and the ecosystem health in the larger
perspective and about the impact on human and livestock communities.
Unfortunately, the field of wildlife health is still very nascent here.
Since, it was large mammal, at least it could be noticed. In case of small
mammals or other ungulates,it may be difficult to detect or observe. (At
this juncture, I have a question? What happens to carnivores if they prey
on such carcasses? Are they more resistant as in dogs??). [Lions are
regularly reported dying of anthrax in the Kruger National Park from
feeding on moribund & dead kudu, with typical oral lesions. The comments
about the relative invisibility of anthrax in smaller animals are very
valid. MHJ
Pasteur-type vaccines are only available in India, although this itself is
not commonly available. [Which explains their lack of success. The Pasteur
vaccine as designed originally or as used today was very dangerous and is
useless. MHJ
I speculate that that origin could have been from sylvatic sources as
animals with latent infection could have caused the outbreak. Anthrax has
been reported from rhinos earlier from parts of Assam although I do not
have the references currently on hand.
[This is an amazing cocktail of fact and fiction. Maybe someone can provide
us with a more factual account. ... etc (rest deleted) MHJ
Dr. Nasser Ahmed, <aaucvs@ren.nic.in>, a co-ordinator of the Indian
Wildlife Health Cooperative, Eastern Region, is visiting the place shortly.
Let's hope we get to hear more from him, first-hand information.
