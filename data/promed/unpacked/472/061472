Four people in Kiruhura have succumbed to Rift Valley fever, which recently broke out in the district, officials have confirmed. The disease is an acute viral hemorrhagic fever that is most commonly seen in domesticated animals.

Although it primarily affects animals, the virus can be transmitted to humans through the handling of animal tissue during slaughtering, animal births, conducting veterinary procedures, or the disposal of carcasses. Human infections have also resulted from the bites of infected mosquitoes.

Rift Valley fever in animals presents with stormy abortions, emaciated looks, and loss of appetite for food and water. In humans, the disease presents with bloody diarrhea, malaise and loss of appetite.

Dr. Grace Asiimwe, the Kiruhura District Veterinary Officer has confirmed the outbreak of Rift Valley fever in the district and the death of the 4 persons. She says the disease has so far been detected in the areas of Sanga, Kinoni, Kigarama, sub counties and Rushere town council. Dr. Asiimwe says farmers and the entire community should be alert for the contagious disease, which shows signs and symptoms of fever, muscle pains, loss of sight among animals, while humans usually have either no symptoms or mild illness such as fever, weakness, back pain, and dizziness.

Dr Asiimwe says Rift Valley fever vaccine is currently out of stock, and advised those who cannot procure it from private suppliers to try preventive measures like sleeping in a mosquito net and avoid contact or eating meat from dead animals.

Dan Mukago, the Kiruhura District Chairperson, says that this is the 2nd time Rift Valley fever has hit the district, the 1st being in 2019. He says they are now sensitizing the population on how to overcome the disease, to file real-time reports about the disease, and to avoid eating meat from aborted fetuses.

The outbreak of Rift Valley fever comes at a time when the same area is battling foot and mouth disease, another infectious and sometimes fatal viral disease that affects cloven-hoofed animals, since February this year [2021].

[Rift Valley fever cases have occurred in Uganda previously. There were RVF livestock cases in 2018. There were 3 reported RVF outbreaks located in 3 separate southwestern districts of Uganda (Mbarara, Isingiro, Lyantonde) (see Rift Valley fever - Eastern Africa (31): Uganda, bovine, OIE 20180907.6014484).

At that time, there also were 2 confirmed human cases (see Rift Valley fever - Eastern Africa (13): Uganda, WHO 20180711.5898523). However, in 2019, no livestock cases were reported. The occurrence of human cases in the absence of reported animal cases prompted Mod.AS to comment: "Unfortunately, during the recent South Sudan RVF event, as in most -- if not all -- previous RVF events in other African countries, humans served as sentinels. Improved surveillance in animals is desperately needed in Africa to allow timely measures applied, predominantly preventive vaccination, before the development of a full-blown epizootic involving secondary infection in humans." This was the situation again in the above report, with human cases and no animal cases mentioned.

It is likely that RVF virus has persisted in Uganda and other countries in East Africa in transovarially infected eggs of _Aedes_ mosquito vectors. These eggs can remain viable for long periods and hatch when flooded during future rain events, with the subsequent emergence of infected females ready to transmit the virus. This risk provides justification for keeping livestock of the area well vaccinated into the future. This may have accounted for the reappearance of RVF in South Sudan in 2018, after nearly 2 years without additional reported cases in humans or livestock, and again with this human case in 2019. - Mod.TY
