Bacterial disease outbreak threatens metro Detroit animals
----------------------------------------------------------
More than 20 cases of the life-threatening bacterial infection
leptospirosis have been reported in Detroit-area dogs in the past 3
weeks, according to Michigan State University's Diagnostic Center for
Population and Animal Health. Experts at the MSU center, a service
unit of the College of Veterinary Medicine, diagnosed the specific
strain of the disease, which can cause fatal damage to dogs and can be
transmitted to humans.

In most cases, the dogs were not vaccinated against leptospirosis, or
they had an uncertain vaccination history. Because this particular
type of leptospirosis is associated with contact with rats, stray dogs
are typically thought to be at highest risk.

"What is particularly unusual about this outbreak is that the dogs
affected are not stray animals, but people's pets," said Carole Bolin,
director of the Diagnostic Center. "Unfortunately, we expect to see
more cases, and this is a very dangerous type of leptospirosis. Many
veterinarians have never seen this type in dogs because it was
markedly reduced by vaccination." Bolin and her team performed
diagnostic testing and identified the particular strain of infection
as icterohaemorrhagiae, which can cause severe disease in humans and
animals. It is commonly carried by rats but also can be transmitted
dog-to-dog or dog-to-human. Bolin is aware of 9 dogs that died or were
euthanized as a result of the disease, but there may be others.

"The Diagnostic Center became involved because of our experience,
expertise and our desire to help the public," Bolin said. "Our
diagnosis helped identify this relatively rare strain, and the samples
we tested will provide teaching tools for our students and residents
so they will recognize this disease in the future."

Leptospirosis spreads by infected wild and domestic animals. The
bacteria (leptospira) that infects these animals can reside in their
kidneys, and the host animal may or may not appear ill. They
contaminate their environment with living leptospira when they
urinate. Pets can become infected by sniffing this urine or by
contacting standing water that becomes contaminated by rain and water
runoff. The bacteria spread rapidly through an animal's blood stream,
usually causing fever, depression and vomiting. The bacteria also
attack the liver and kidneys, which can lead to organ failure.

"This is a very serious, rapidly progressing type of leptospirosis in
dogs," Bolin said. "Dogs can appear normal one day and be severely ill
the next day. People can become infected, so this also is a threat to
animal owners, caretakers and veterinarians."

In the 1980s, Bolin's mentor Alex Thiermann conducted studies on the
high leptospirosis prevalence in the rat and dog population in
Detroit. Leptospirosis caused by icterohaemorrhagiae was identified as
a cause of human cases and as a common infection in rats and stray
dogs. The prevalence of leptospirosis dropped significantly after the
conditions predisposing to large rat populations were corrected.

Also, a leptospirosis vaccine was routinely administered to dogs,
greatly diminishing the number of cases. As cases of disease in dogs
decreased and because of the vaccine's potential for adverse
reactions, vaccine use diminished and it no is longer given to all
dogs. However, Bolin said this outbreak demonstrates that
leptospirosis remains a significant risk for dogs. [There are several
excellent Leptospirosis vaccines currently on the market. While it is
not necessarily combined with other vaccines, such as parvo, as it
once was, there is a vaccine available. Clearly people need to be
vaccinating against this disease as it is showing a bit of resurgence.

"There is something we can do now to prevent this disease and that is
to vaccinate," she said. "Dog owners need to contact their
veterinarian to get more information regarding vaccination."

MSU's Diagnostic Center for Population and Animal Health has become
one of the country's premier veterinary diagnostic laboratories,
handling more than 220 000 cases involving approximately 1.5 million
tests annually.

[An outbreak of Leptospirosis in domestic dogs, not allowed to roam
free, is indeed unusual. There may be a common thread and the
epidemiology of the situation needs to be investigated.

Leptospirosis is caused by various species of _Leptospira_, a
spirochete in the family Leptospiraceae, order Spirochaetales. The
classification of this organism is complex. Before 1989, all of the
pathogenic isolates belonged to the species _Leptospira interrogans_,
which contained more than 200 serovars in 23 serogroups. More
recently, the genus _Leptospira_ has been reclassified into 16 or more
species.

All mammals appear to be susceptible to at least one species of
_Leptospira_. Disease is rare in cats, and less common in sheep than
cattle. Serovars associated with disease in cattle include _hardjo_,
_pomona_, _grippotyphosa_, _canicola_, and _icterohaemorrhagiae_.
Serovars associated with disease in sheep and goats include _hardjo_,
_pomona_, _grippotyphosa_, and _ballum_. Serovars associated with
disease in pigs include _pomona_, _grippotyphosa_, _bratislava_,
_canicola_, _icterohaemorrhagiae_, _tarassovi_, and _muenchen_.
Serovars associated with disease in horses include _hardjo_, _pomona_,
_canicola_, _icterohaemorrhagiae_, and _sejroe_. Serovars associated
with disease in dogs include _pomona_, _grippotyphosa_, _canicola_,
_icterohaemorrhagiae_, _pyrogenes_, _paidjan_, _tarassovi_, _ballum_,
and _bratislava_.

The primary reservoir hosts for most _Leptospira_ serovars are wild
mammals, particularly rodents. Reservoir hosts among domestic animals
include cattle, pigs, sheep, and dogs. The specific reservoir host(s)
vary with the serovar and the geographic region. Disease in reservoir
hosts is more likely to be asymptomatic, mild, or chronic. Reservoir
hosts include:
- rats: serogroups _icterohaemorrhagiae_ and _ballum_
- mice: serogroup _ballum_
- cattle: serovars _hardjo_, _grippotyphosa_, and _pomona_
- sheep: serovars _hardjo_ and _pomona_
- pigs: serovars _pomona_, _tarassovi_, and _bratislava_
- dogs: serovars _canicola_ and _bataviae_.

So clearly this is a diverse group of serovars affecting a variety of
animals, and humans. This is a zoonotic disease and in many states is
a reportable disease to the state animal health association or
veterinarian when it is diagnosed in a dog. The human-animal bond may
increase the likelihood of an exposure to a human being.

While knowing the serovars may help in some regions, it may not in
other regions. It may in some cases help determine the source: the
local pond, or an encounter with a pig.

Leptospirosis can be transmitted either directly between hosts or
indirectly in the environment. _Leptospira_ spp. can be ingested in
contaminated food or water, spread in aerosolized urine or water, or
transmitted by direct contact with the skin. The organisms usually
enter the body through mucous membranes or abraded skin. They may also
be able to penetrate intact skin that has been immersed for a long
time in water. _Leptospira_ spp. are excreted in the urine, and can be
found in aborted or stillborn fetuses, as well as in normal fetuses or
vaginal discharges after calving. They can be isolated from the male
reproductive organs. Human cases have also been transmitted during
sexual intercourse, by breast feeding, from rodent bites, and after
laboratory accidents.

_Leptospira_ spp. do not multiply outside the host. In the
environment, they require high humidity for survival and are killed by
dehydration or temperatures greater than 50 deg C (122 deg F). They
can remain viable from a few to many weeks or months in contaminated
soil and for several weeks in cattle slurry. They can remain viable in
water for several months under laboratory conditions, but do not
survive as well in river water under natural conditions.

The clinical signs and severity of disease are highly variable in
dogs. Some infections are asymptomatic or mild, while others are
severe or fatal. The initial signs are usually nonspecific and may
include fever, depression, anorexia, stiffness, myalgia, shivering,
and weakness. The mucus membranes are often injected. These symptoms
may be followed by signs of kidney disease including anuria,
hematuria, or increased frequency of urination, vomiting, dehydration,
and oral ulceration. Abortions, diarrhea, gray stools, coughing,
dyspnea, conjunctivitis, weight loss, and jaundice may also be seen.
Hemorrhagic syndromes occur in some dogs: the mucus membranes may have
widespread petechial and ecchymotic hemorrhages and, in later stages
of the disease, there may be hemorrhagic gastroenteritis and
epistaxis. Some dogs die peracutely without clinical signs. Chronic
kidney disease can be a sequela. Chronic infections may be
asymptomatic, or associated with fever of unknown origin and
conjunctivitis.

_Leptospira_ may be found in the blood, milk, and cerebrospinal,
thoracic, or peritoneal fluids. During chronic infections, they are
sometimes found in the urine. The liver, lung, brain, and kidney are
collected at necropsy from acute cases, and the kidney and genital
tract are tested in chronic cases. Organisms can also be found in the
body fluids or tissues of aborted fetuses.

Antibiotics used to treat leptospirosis include the tetracyclines,
penicillin/ampicillin, dihydrostreptomycin, streptomycin, and the
fluoroquinolones. The efficacy of treatment may depend on the serovar.
Fluid therapy, blood transfusions, and other supportive care may also
be necessary.

Control of this organism may depend upon sanitation and disinfection
of the area. _Leptospira_ species can be inactivated by 1 percent
sodium hypochlorite, 70 percent ethanol, glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde,
detergents, and acid. This organism is sensitive to moist heat (121
deg C/250 deg F for a minimum of 15 minutes) and is also killed by
pasteurization. Preventing contact with likely carriers of the
organism may be the best prevention. The vaccine is, as the article
pointed out, useful and helpful in controlling/preventing the
disease.
