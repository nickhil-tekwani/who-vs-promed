A wild duck has been found positive for HPAI H5N8 in the municipality of Osterwald in the German county Bentheim, 25 km [15.53 mi] from the Dutch city Almelo.

The Friedrich-LÃ¶ffler Institute (FLI) has confirmed the infection officially on [Fri 20 Oct 2017]. The finding has come to light on the basis of the German Wild Bird Monitoring Program. There are no poultry farms in a 3 km [1.86 mi] radius around the site. No restriction area has been set.

The site is adjacent to the [district] Twente, [within the] province of Overijssel.

According to Avined [a Dutch foundation composed of representatives of the main poultry organisations], the infection clearly shows that the avian flu virus is present in the area and that strict biosecurity remains necessary.

[Dutch farmers are alarmed by the reported renewed circulation of HPAI H5N8 close to the country's eastern border. The annual return of the bird migration season may herald a return of HPAI H5N8 to poultry farms, globally.

According to the WHO report of Mar 2017 addressing human risk of the avian influenza A(H5N8) virus, human infection with the A(H5N8) virus cannot be excluded, although the likelihood is low, based on the limited information obtained to the publication date; see, accompanied by Mod.UBA's commentary, in 20170308.4886536.

HPAI H5N8 virus has been widely circulating in northern Italy recently. According to a new follow-up report, submitted to the OIE on 20 Oct 2017, 8 new outbreaks have been recorded there since 12 Oct 2017, affecting chickens, turkeys, geese, ducks, and (on one backyard holding) also swans.
