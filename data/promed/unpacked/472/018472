There's been another anthrax outbreak, but this one has only resulted
in the death of one animal so far. It's in a small cattle herd in the
Prince Albert area.

Lynn Bates, with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency says this is an
area where anthrax has occurred in the past, most recently in a bison
herd in 2008. [In the Prince Albert National Park. - Mod.MHJ]

Bates says the animals in the herd have been vaccinated for anthrax
now and the farm is under quarantine.

There have been 2 other cases of anthrax in the province so far this
year [2010], both are in the southern part of the province around
Weyburn. There were substantial deaths in a bison herd in the RM
[rural municipality] of Wellington and there were 15 deaths, 14
cattle, and one horse, on a farm in the RM of Fillmore.

[In a province like Saskatchewan with an enzootic of anthrax, there
are always going to be background almost random sporadic outbreaks.
If circumstances are right these can spark off epidemics. If not they
are just a dead cow. When the farming community is alert and this 1st
case is found and rapidly diagnosed, carcass burnt, and herd
vaccinated, it can stay as just one dead cow. Delays and accumulated
deaths in the herd will result in the neighbours' stock being
infected. Our Canadian colleagues are to be congratulated. - Mod.MHJ]
