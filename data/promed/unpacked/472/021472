Fear of anthrax stalks Jaldapara
----------------------------------------------------
Jaldapara Wildlife Sanctuary is gearing up for a possible anthrax
attack as a rhino calf is suspected to have died of the disease
yesterday [17 Aug 2009]. The body of the 4-year-old female rhino had
been found in the Moiradanga beat, 50km from here. The sanctuary is
famous for its one-horned rhino, the number of which had in recent
years risen considerably. The last census had revealed the presence
of 128 rhinos against the 14 found in 1985.
Samples of the tissues have been sent to the State Forensic Science
Laboratory in Calcutta's Belgachia and Forensic Laboratory in
Guwahati for tests. Some forest employees had seen the baby rhino
shivering, one of the symptoms of anthrax, before it died. The
reports of the tests from the 2 laboratories are expected to reach
Jaldapara within a week. "We suspect that the sub-adult female rhino
died of anthrax and to determine the actual cause of death we have
sent samples to both the laboratories," said S.B. Patel, the chief
conservator of forest (wild life, north).
The worried Jaldapara authorities have written to Calcutta to send
anthrax vaccines as well as tranquillisers for big animals like
elephants and rhinos. There is also an acute shortage of needle(s),
feather (to balance the darts) and barrel essential for carrying out
tranquillisation. "We need tranquillisers, too, because if the
samples test positive for anthrax, we will go for mass vaccination.
For that we will have to tranquillise the animals. We will start with
the vaccination of captive animals in Jaldapara especially the
elephants. The equipment necessary for tranquillisation can be easily
collected from other divisions but there is a shortage of the
tranquilliser itself in the region," said Patel.
In the absence of tranquillisers, an injured makna (male elephant
without tusk) has been roaming the Harindanga beat for the past few days.
Proloy Mandal, the vet of Jaldapara, said it was difficult to
tranquillise big animals in the monsoon. "Big animals like elephants
will not be able to get up by themselves if they fall in a swamp or
marshy land."

[It is unusual to see cases of anthrax in rhinos but it raises the
definite possibility of other species being affected in this part of
the terai/Himalayan foothills. More information on results of
laboratory studies would be appreciated.
