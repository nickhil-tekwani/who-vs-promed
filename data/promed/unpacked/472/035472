Two elephants at Point Defiance Zoo & Aquarium have tested positive for tuberculosis, zoo officials announced Wednesday [13 Nov 2019].

Tuberculosis is an infectious disease affecting the lungs, and there is evidence it can be passed from some animals, including elephants, to humans.

That's what officials believed happened when staff members tested positive with a latent, or inactive, tuberculosis infection in September [2019]. [See ProMED-mail post Tuberculosis - USA: (WA) latent, zoo elephant handlers, RFI 20190927.6697446.] A tuberculosis infection is not contagious when it is in the latent stage, according to the Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department. The staff members had all worked with the elephants.

"We're all assuming that the source of exposure is the elephants," Point Defiance Zoo director Alan Varsik told The News Tribune. Currently, "there's virtually no risk to our audience," Varsik said, but staff are taking safety precautions.

"Keeping our staff, animals and the public safe continues to be our top priority. Now that we have these test results, our animal care team is assessing next steps for these beloved animals," Varsik said in a press release.

The zoo's 2 elderly elephants, Hanako and Suki, both tested positive but are not showing symptoms of the illness, officials said. The animal care team is monitoring them closely, according to head veterinarian Dr. Karen Wolf. The 2 elephants are above the median life expectancy for a female Asian elephant in human care, which is about 47 years.

"Both elephants continue to eat well and spend time in their outdoor habitat every day," Wolf said. "At ages 56 and 55, Hanako and Suki are geriatric elephants with multiple health challenges. So intensive, long-term TB treatment is not the best medical approach for them."

No active human cases of tuberculosis have been found as public health authorities continue to investigate. Bacteria that cause tuberculosis most commonly are spread from person to person via coughing and sneezing.

Tuberculosis has been reported in elephants as far back as 1875 and occurs in elephants in the wild and in zoos, according to a press release by Point Defiance.

[In September 2019, "some" staff members who work with and around elephants at Point Defiance Zoo & Aquarium in Tacoma, Washington tested positive for latent tuberculosis (TB) infection (LTBI). (See ProMED-mail post Tuberculosis - USA: (WA) latent, zoo elephant handlers, RFI 20190927.6697446.) We, however, were not told in the news report at the time the exact number of elephant workers diagnosed with LTBI, if the diagnosis of LTBI in the elephant workers was made by use of tuberculin skin testing (TST) or interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA; a blood test), or if the workers with LTBI were treated with antibiotics to prevent active TB disease from developing. Presumably, the positive test for LTBI in the workers represents a conversion from a previously negative result, done in a periodic testing program, which would indicate a recent infection in the elephant workers.

Elephants are susceptible to both _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ and _Mycobacterium bovis_, and infection with these organisms can be transmitted from elephants to their handlers, as well as in the reverse direction. In elephants, culture of trunk washes x 3 is accepted as the gold standard diagnostic test for active TB. According the news report above, test results, presumably by trunk washing, are "positive" for 2 of the zoo's elephants," but neither elephant is said to show signs of active TB. We are not told the exact species of _Mycobacterium_, _M. tuberculosis_ or _M. bovis_, causing the elephants' infection; nevertheless, the elephants will not undergo long-term medical therapy for TB because of the elephants' advanced age.

The source for the elephant workers' infections presumably is the infected elephants, but the zoo-going general public is thought to have "virtually no risk," and the elephant workers are taking "safety precautions." We are not told, however, what those precautions are. - Mod.ML
