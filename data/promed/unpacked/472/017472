Another big cat species tested positive for coronavirus, this time a snow leopard. It's the 6th animal species confirmed to have been infected with the virus after human contact.

Three snow leopards, 2 males and a female, tested positive for the virus at the Louisville Zoo [Kentucky], the zoo and the US Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service confirmed Friday [11 Dec 2020].

The female's infection was confirmed first. All 3 leopards, whose symptoms are "mild" and include wheezes and dry coughs, are expected to fully recover, Louisville Zoo director John Walczak said in a filmed statement.

The leopards were likely infected by an asymptomatic staff member "despite precautions taken by the zoo," the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspect Service said.

It's unlikely the leopards -- or other animals -- pose a significant risk in transmitting the virus to humans, as COVID-19 is primarily spread between people.

The snow leopards are one of at least 6 animal species to become infected with coronavirus after close contact with humans. The 1st was a Malayan tiger at the Bronx Zoo, who in April [2020] tested positive for coronavirus after showing symptoms of respiratory illness. By the end of the month [April 2020], 8 of the zoo's big cats, including 4 other tigers and 3 African lions, tested positive for the virus.

A small number of dogs and cats have been infected with the virus in the US, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In most animal cases, coronavirus isn't deadly, though coronavirus outbreaks at fur farms in the US and abroad have killed thousands of mink.

[Infection by SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed so far in carnivores of 3 families, canids (dogs and raccoon dogs), felids (cats, tigers, lions, puma/cougar, and snow leopard), and mustelids (ferrets and minks). Carnivores in general appear to be susceptible to infection. All prior infections detected were from animals held captive, except for the recent record of a wild mink captured and sampled in Utah. The susceptibility of carnivores warrants surveillance and research in wild populations, as introduction and possible establishment of SARS-CoV-2 in those populations might result in conservation problems and/or compartments in which the virus might evolve and remain with potential for future human exposures. - Mod.PMB
