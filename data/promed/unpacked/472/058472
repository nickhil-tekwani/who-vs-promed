Fears of epidemics spark new drive on disease
AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE

Fears that the growing number of migrant workers could help spread fatal
epidemics in China have sparked a new drive to control serious infectious
diseases.
The national campaign will focus on new and resurgent illnesses such as
AIDS, tuberculosis and the _E.coli_ 0157 bacteria that struck Japan and
Scotland last year, Dai Zhichong, the director of the Health Ministry's
Disease Control Department, told China Daily yesterday.
Other targeted diseases include cholera and bubonic plague.
He said the rise in the size of the floating population of about 80 million
migrant workers, and increasing contact with foreign countries, was making
anti-epidemic work tougher.....
The ministry spent about 400,000 yuan (HK$374,000) last year on
surveillance work to trace the _E.coli_ 0157 bacteria, the paper said.
About 3,000 cholera cases were reported in China last year, compared with
more than 30,000 in 1994, it said.
