Texas: First Human West Nile Case Confirmed; 4 More Houston Cases Suspected
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A 50-year-old man from Orange County is the first human case of West Nile
virus infection in Texas, blood tests confirmed today. In addition, health
officials are waiting for more test results on a 74-year-old man
hospitalized on 16 Jul 2002 with altered mental status, a West Nile
symptom. Test results are pending on 3 more suspected adult cases as
well.
The Orange County man who contracted West Nile virus infection was
hospitalized last week at the Houston Veteran's Affairs Medical
Center, where he was in stable condition today. He went to an
emergency room in Orange County where he reported having a fever,
headache, vomiting and neck stiffness. He was then transferred to the
VA hospital here. Dr. Daniel Musher, head of infectious disease at
the VA, had strongly suspected West Nile virus infection in his
patient for a number of reasons [see preceding ProMED-mail post:
"West Nile virus, human - USA (Texas): suspected"]. Today's test
results are to be sent to the Texas Department of Health for
confirmation.
