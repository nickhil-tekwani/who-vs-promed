CONTAMINATED BEACHES, WARNING
*****************************
Date: Wed, 02 Jul 1997 23:45:42 -0400
From: Robert A. LaBudde <ral@lcfltd.com>
Excerpted from FSNET (D. Powell, Univ. Guelph):
The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) has warned that beaches in Key
West, Fla., Myrtle Beach, S.C., the Outer Banks of North Carolina, Panama
City, Fla. and Puerto Rico had no pollution tests for swimmer safety last
year or no notices to keep swimmers out of unhealthy water. Sarah Chassis,
director of NRDC's coastal project, which annually tracks more than 30
coastal and Great Lakes areas around the United States was quoted as saying,
"I'd be careful about swimming in those waters, particularly after a heavy
rain." They warn that swimming in water tainted with sewage could lead to
fever, diarrhea, vomiting and muscular problems. Toxic algal blooms were
also a threat, killing fish and potentially harming fishermen, swimmers and
others in beach and river waters. The areas mentioned in the article were
warned because they are known to have storm drains nearby and septic
pollution but no warning systems. The article goes on to say that although
Myrtle Beach and North Carolina recently started testing programs, they were
on the list because Myrtle Beach had no plans to alert the public about
pollution and North Carolina had not yet set a health standard nor designed a
public notice system. Santa Barbara in California and Miami Beach in Florida
were taken off the list from last year because they had adopted new monitoring
systems. The story states that in areas where there were public alerts,
almost 85 percent of beach closings and warnings nationwide last year were
triggered when bacteria levels rose above water quality standards. But
those standards varied from state to state and even county to county. The
list also contains those beaches approved by the NRDC for use by the public.
