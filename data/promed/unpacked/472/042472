[According to the above immediate notification, the event started 29 Aug 2012 in a layer flock, lab diagnosed 13 Sep 2012. Reportedly, the status of this outbreak is "continuing (or date resolved not provided)." The 2nd outbreak, in a broiler flock within 1 km from the 1st outbreak, started almost 6 weeks later (10 Oct 2012); date and details of diagnosis not available. The status of the 2nd outbreak is, reportedly, "resolved." Though common source of infection for both flocks is not excluded, most likely the 1st outbreak was the source of infection for the 2nd flock. Complementary epidemiological information, including dates of destructions in both flocks, may become available in a follow-up report.
