Dispatch of live cattle, goats, and sheep banned from south Spain due to
bluetongue
-----------------------------------------------
The bluetongue surveillance system detected the circulation of the
bluetongue virus in a number of sentinel cattle in south Spain, in the
Municipality of Jimena de la Frontera, in the Province of Cadiz, on 13 Oct
2004. Bluetongue is an easy-spreading viral disease of domestic and wild
ruminants transmitted by insects. It is not known to affect humans.
As a safeguard measure, the European Commission will today [14 Oct 2004]
adopt a decision banning the dispatch and export of live animals -- and
their semen, embryos, and ova -- of the bluetongue-susceptible species
(sheep, goats, cattle, and wild ruminants) from some southern provinces of
Spain. The provinces are: Cadiz, Malaga, Sevilla, and parts of the
provinces Huelva (comarca de La Palma del Condado et de Ayamonte), Cordoba
(comarca de Lucena, de Montilla et de Posada), and Granada (comarca de la
Alhama de Granada et de Loja). The Commission decision, and the disease
situation, will be reviewed at the meeting of the Standing Committee on the
Food Chain and Animal Health on 19 Oct 2004. For more information on this
disease see:

EU Council Directive 2000/75/EC of 20 Nov 2000, laying down specific
provisions for the control and eradication of bluetongue, can be seen at

[Bluetongue (BT) entered Portugal and Spain for the 1st time in 1956 and
reportedly persisted in Portugal until 1959, and in Spain until 1960,
killing, within the 1st 4 months of the said outbreak, 46 000 sheep in
Portugal and 133 000 in Spain [Roberts DH, 1990. Bluetongue: a review.
State Veterinary Journal, 44(124):66-80; 40 ref.]. The enormity of this
outbreak was one of the reasons for the addition of BT to the OIE List A
diseases.
To the best of my knowledge, no additional clinical nor subclinical case of
BT has been reported from (peninsular) Spain for the period from 1960 until
October 2004 (corrective remarks will be welcomed). It will be interesting
to note whether (significant) serological surveillance has been undertaken
in local bovines there throughout the said period, and what the results
were. The current (sub-clinical?) cases in bovines have been detected
within the framework of the current EU-prescribed sero-surveillance in
sentinel bovines. Data on the percentage of positive sera within the
surveyed groups, and the identity of the BT virus (BTV) serotype involved,
will be of particular interest. In 1999, BTV-2 was reported from Tunisia,
then spread along the western Mediterranean basin to Algeria, Corsica
Island (France), Sardinia Island (Italy), and Menorca and Mallorca Islands
(Spain, collectively known as the Balearic Islands). Since then, the virus
seems to have been established in the said territories, demonstrating the
typical seasonality which reflects the seasonal activity of the relevant
culicoides vectors.
An updated (though not yet covering the new Spanish findings) comprehensive
overview of the BT situation in the Mediterranean basin, 1998 - 2004,
including maps, tables, and data on the BTV setrotypes and vector species
involved, can be seen at
