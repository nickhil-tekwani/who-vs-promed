This newly-described amphibian disease has now been reported almost
worldwide for the first time. Recent work implicates the international
trade in amphibians as a mechanism of introduction, and legislation is
currently being considered to curtail this risk. The disease has drawn
attention due to its association with amphibian population declines.
Amphibian chytridiomycosis is caused by a non-hyphal, protist-like chytrid
fungus (Phylum Chytridiomycota) infecting keratinized amphibian epidermal
cells, causing thickening of the stratum corneum (the outer layer of skin)
and death by an unknown mechanism. Chytrid fungi are early-branching true
fungi inhabiting soil, freshwater ponds and streams, and degrade chitin,
keratin and other detritus. Some are parasites of algae, invertebrates and
plants. The amphibian chytrid (_Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis_) is the
only species known to parasitize vertebrates.
Chytridiomycosis, described in 1998 from Australian and Central American
amphibians dead at sites of mass mortality and population declines, is
pathogenic to a range of amphibians (frogs, toads, salamanders) in the wild
and experimentally. The pathogen has been cultured on modified agar, and
Koch's postulates have been proven. Its recent geographic expansion (e.g.,
W. Australia), probable increase in impact on amphibian populations, and
recent discovery mark it as an emerging infectious disease (EID), one of a
growing number of wildlife EIDs.
In Australia, species in decline tend to be habitat specialists with low
fecundity -- traits possibly predisposing populations to declines with
virulent pathogens. Often, outbreaks have resulted in multi-species local
population extinctions. The ability of _Batrachochytrium_ to persist as a
saprobe in the absence of amphibian hosts (shown in the lab) or via
aclinical infection of long-lived tadpoles may explain the disease's
ability to cause local extinctions.
It has been hypothesized that chytridiomycosis was the proximal cause of
extinction of the golden toad of Costa Rica and 2 species of Australian
gastric brooding frogs. Chytridiomycosis was confirmed as the cause of
death in the last live collected individuals of _Taudactylus acutirostris_,
another Australian species thought likely to be extinct.
[Chytridiomycosis is associated with population crashes worldwide: USA (8
states and 11 amphibian species); Central America (Panama and Costa Rica);
South America (Ecuador); Europe (Spain); Australia (44 species in eastern
and western states); and infected animals have recently been reported in
Africa (South Africa and Kenya), New Zealand (South Island), Europe
(Germany) and Uruguay. Further details can be obtained from the following
regularly-updated global distribution list:

discussion, see <http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol5no6/daszak.htm>)
Historical data (from archival collections) indicates the first presence of
chytridiomycosis in North America in the 1970s and in Australia during
1978. Epizootiological data from Central America and Australia (high
mortality rates, wave-like spread of declines, wide host range) suggest
introduction of _Batrachochytrium_ into naive populations and the disease
subsequently becoming enzootic in some areas (e.g., USA and some parts of
Australia).
Chytridiomycosis has recently been reported from amphibians within the
international pet trade (Europe and USA), the trade in amphibians for
outdoor pond stocking (USA), importation for zoo collections (Europe, USA),
laboratory animal supply stocks of domestic and foreign origin (USA), and
species known to have recently been introduced nationally and
internationally (cane toad in Australia, bullfrogs in USA, _Litoria_
species in New Zealand).
These trades often involve high numbers of individual amphibians: e.g., 180
000 amphibians of at least 21 endangered European species were imported
into the UK alone, between 1981 and 1990. The majority of frog legs sold in
restaurants in France, the rest of Europe and the USA are in fact from
bullfrogs (_Rana catesbeiana_), a north American species, bred in
specialized bullfrog farms in the Far East and South America, then exported
to Europe and the USA as live animals or frozen parts.
Global climate change has been proposed as a mechanism of emergence for
chytridiomycosis. Data from Monteverde, Costa Rica, suggests a climate
change-induced increase in the number of dry days and length of dry periods
in winter coinciding with extinction of the golden toad (_Bufo
periglenes_). There is a hypothesis of environmental drying causing
crowding of amphibians at water sources, leading to increased rates of
transmission.
Legislation to prevent introduction has begun: the Parks and Wildlife
Commission of the Northern Territory (Australia) has recently banned
national and international import and export of amphibians. Clearly, the
increasing prevalence of this disease worldwide makes it an emerging
disease of great importance.
