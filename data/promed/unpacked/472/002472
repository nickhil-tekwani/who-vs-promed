A man of 28 years remains in an extremely critical state, the 1st
confirmed hantavirus [infection] case detected in the capital. The
patient, who is a teacher in the Chemistry and Pharmacy Faculty of the
University of Chile and a doctoral student in medical sciences was
infected in the southern areas of the country while working to help
victims of the earthquake.

The Chief of the Critical Care Unit, Clinical Hospital, University of
Chile, Dr Rodrigo Cornejo, stated that the condition of the patient is
extremely serious. He is on ventricular assistance and extracorporeal
oxygenation, that is to say with support of his cardiac and
respiratory functions.

In Chile, the etiological agent [of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome] is
Andes hantavirus. The most important mode of transmission is by
inhalation of aerosols from [dried] feces, urine and saliva of carrier
rodents.

The disease presents [initially] with symptoms similar to the common
cold with high fever, muscular pain and headache.

To prevent infection in the population [by a hantavirus] in rural
areas, it is recommended that areas [in buildings] that have been
closed for a long time be ventilated for 30 minutes before entering
them. Then spray the soil [and floors] and surfaces with water and
bleach. The population must maintain the exterior areas around houses
and outbuildings free of weeds and trash. The outbuildings must be
ventilated and maintained in good order, without discarded materials.
Also, it is vital to maintain food and water out of the reach of
rodents, always stored in hermetically sealed containers.

[Hantavirus infections -- as with other infections in nature such as
plague, yellow fever and others transmitted by vectors, such as dengue
-- undergo significant variability in incidence year-to-year, with
peaks in some years without rational explanations. This seems to be
the year of hantavirus infections in South America. - Mod.LJS]

[The actual locality of the earthquake zone where this patient might
have been infected by Andes virus is not specified in this report.

[2] Bolivia (Tarija)

The department [state or province equivalent] Health Service (SEDES),
so far this year [2010], has recorded 5 suspected and one confirmed
hantavirus [infection] cases in the Padcaya municipality, capital of
the 1st section of Arce province [in Tarija department]. "Up to the
month of March [2010], we are speaking of 6 suspected cases, of which
[samples from] 4 were sent to the laboratory, with a result of one
positive & 3 negatives, with the death of the person who was positive.
Meanwhile we await the laboratory results of the last 2," said Grover
Flores, Coordinator of department Health. He indicated that the last 2
cases of hantavirus infection were recorded this last Friday and
Sunday [19 and 21 Mar 2010, respectively]. "On Friday [19 Mar 2010] a
suspected case was identified in the Padcaya Hospital, from whom
samples were taken and transported immediately to the SEDES laboratory
in Tarija, in order to be sent on to La Paz or Santa Cruz for
confirmation. On Sunday [21 Mar 2010], another case [appeared], which
is also being followed up," he stated.

He indicated that since January [2010] a public awareness campaign for
residents in the most vulnerable zones for the disease is being
carried out. "We have a small [health] brigade assembled in January
[2010] which began to work on cleanup and public education,
distributing poison [and] placing traps to capture the rodents that
transmit the viruses," he stated.

Hantavirus [pulmonary] syndrome is an acute infectious disease,
usually serious, which is produced by a virus which infects certain
types of rodents (mice and rats). It remains in them for life without
producing disease. [The virus infects] humans via the respiratory
route or occasionally [through] wounds.

[Padcaya is in an inter-Andean mountain valley, and the hantavirus
involved in these cases is reported to be Andes virus.
