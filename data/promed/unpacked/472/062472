The Burnett County Health Department reports that a horse in Burnett County has tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), which is caused by the EEE virus. This is the 1st confirmed case of EEE in a horse in Burnett County this year [2021], and the 2nd case in horses in the state this year [2021]. No EEE cases in humans have been reported in Wisconsin thus far in 2021; however, there were 2 human cases in 2020.

EEE virus is spread to humans, horses, and other animals through the bite of an infected mosquito. Mosquitoes acquire EEE virus by feeding on infected birds. The virus is not spread person to person or directly between animals or between animals and humans. Documentation of an EEE positive horse, however, confirms that there are mosquitoes in the area infected with the EEE virus that can spread the virus to people and other animals.

Many people infected with EEE virus do not get sick. Those who do become ill may develop fever, headache, chills, and vomiting. The illness may become severe, resulting in encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), disorientation, seizures, coma, or death. There is no specific vaccine or treatment for EEE illness available for people.

Signs of EEE infection in horses include depression, loss of appetite, drooping eyelids and lower lip, blindness, paralysis, and death. Horse owners can vaccinate their horses against EEE virus to protect them from becoming ill.

Since EEE virus is known to be circulating in Burnett County, residents and visitors should be vigilant in preventing mosquito bites. Follow these tips to protect yourself and your family against mosquito bites:

Avoid mosquito bites
- Apply an insect repellent with DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, or IR3535 to exposed skin and clothing.
- Prior to heading outdoors, treat clothing with permethrin; do not apply permethrin directly to skin.
- Consider rescheduling outdoor activities that occur during evening or early morning hours, when mosquitoes are most active.
- Wear long sleeves, long pants, and socks when outdoors to help keep mosquitoes away from your skin.

Mosquito-proof your home
- Make sure window and door screens are intact and tightly fitted to prevent mosquitoes from getting into your home.
- Prevent mosquitoes from breeding around your home by removing stagnant water from items around your property, such as tin cans, plastic containers, flowerpots, discarded tires, roof gutters, and downspouts.
- Turn over wheelbarrows, kiddie pools, buckets, and small boats such as canoes and kayaks when not in use.
- Change the water in bird baths and pet dishes at least every 3 days.
- Clean and chlorinate swimming pools, outdoor saunas, and hot tubs; drain water from pool covers.
- Trim or mow tall grass, weeds, and vines since mosquitoes use these areas to rest during hot daylight hours.

Calumet County health officials confirmed the 1st case of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in a horse in their county, and the 3rd known case in the state, this year [2021].

EEE can be transmitted to humans and animals by the bite of a mosquito, which pick up the virus by feeding on infected birds. The virus is not shared directly between animals and humans.

Most people infected with EEE don't have symptoms, but those who do may have a fever, headache, chills, and vomiting, progressing to inflammation of the brain, disorientation, seizures, and possibly coma and death.

There have been no confirmed EEE cases in humans this year. [2021] There were 2 confirmed cases last year. [2020]

Health officials say there is no specific vaccine or treatment for EEE [in people, but there is in horses. - Mod.TG]. Prevention is the same as preventing mosquito bites: wearing insect repellent outdoors; avoiding outdoor activities during early evening or early morning hours, when mosquitoes are most active; and wearing long sleeves, long pants, and socks outdoors.

Michigan's 1st case this year [2021] of the mosquito-borne viral disease eastern equine encephalitis has been found in a Livingston County horse.

The positive case of the disease, also known as EEE, was found in a 2-year-old Standardbred filly from the county, said Dr. Nora Wineland, Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development veterinarian.

The disease, transmittable to both animals and humans, typically emerges in late summer to early fall each year.

State officials want to warn horse owners and Michigan residents to take precautions to protect themselves from the disease, including vaccination. It has a 90% fatality rate in horses and a 33% fatality rate in humans who become ill, state officials said.

"The Livingston County horse was never vaccinated against EEE, and it developed signs of illness -- including fever, lethargy, and depression -- which progressed to the animal exhibiting neurologic signs and being down on the ground with an inability to get up," Wineland said in a statement.

"The horse was euthanized due to her declining condition. It is critically important for horse owners to reach out to their veterinarian to discuss how to best protect their animals from this disease."

In 2020, Michigan experienced 41 cases of EEE in animals and 4 cases in humans, officials said.

To protect animals from mosquitos and the disease, the state recommends discussing vaccinations and any potential signs with a veterinarian. Other measures include placing fans over horses to disrupt mosquitos in flight, using animal-safe insect repellant, and removing standing water on property.

The disease does not transmit between horses or from horses to humans, officials said. It is only transmitted through mosquitos.

In humans, symptoms include sudden fever, chills, and aches in the body and joints. Severe EEE symptoms are headaches, disorientation, tremors, seizures, paralysis, permanent brain damage, coma, and sometimes death.

"This equine case indicates the EEE virus is here in Michigan and provides a warning that residents could also become infected by a mosquito," said Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, Michigan Department of Health and Human Services chief medical executive. "Michigan residents are urged to take precautions and protect themselves from mosquito bites."

Humans can wear insect repellant, as well as long-sleeve shirts and pants when outdoors to prevent mosquito bites. People should also keep doors and windows closed. Some of the preventative measures for horses also apply, such as fans and removal of standing water.

The risk for EEE and other mosquito-borne illnesses will last until late fall when temperatures start to dip, officials said. For more information about mosquito-borne diseases, visit https://www.michigan.gov/emergingdiseases.

A horse in New Jersey has been humanely euthanized after contracting a serious mosquito-borne illness, according to the New Jersey Department of Agriculture.

A 7-year-old Atlantic County mare is the 1st reported case of eastern equine encephalitis in New Jersey for 2021, the state agriculture department said. The mare had not been vaccinated against EEE.

"We continue to encourage horse owners be vigilant in vaccinating their animals against these diseases spread by mosquitoes," New Jersey Secretary of Agriculture Douglas H. Fisher said. "Vaccinated animals are much less likely to contract deadly diseases such as EEE and West Nile virus."

EEE causes inflammation of the brain tissue and has a significantly higher risk of death in horses than West Nile virus infection, according to the state agriculture department. West Nile virus is another serious mosquito-borne viral disease that affects a horse's neurological system. The diseases are transmitted by a mosquito bite. The virus cycles between birds and mosquitoes with horses and humans being incidental hosts.

EEE infections in horses are not a significant risk factor for human infection because horses, like humans, are "dead-end" hosts for the virus. Reported animal West Nile virus cases in New Jersey this year [2021] have been limited to wild avian species, 3 Cooper's hawks and one American crow.

In general, most regions in New Jersey have a reported mosquito population at or slightly above the 5-year averages. The 1st EEE-positive mosquito pool was detected in Gloucester County this year [2021].

The state agriculture department said livestock owners are strongly encouraged to vaccinate against WNV, EEE, and other mosquito-borne diseases. Effective equine vaccines for EEE and WNV are available commercially. The state said horse owners should contact their veterinarians if their horses are not up to date on their vaccinations against both EEE and WNV.

For more information about EEE in horses, people can visit the New Jersey Department of Agriculture website at https://www.nj.gov/agriculture/divisions/ah/diseases/diseaseworksheets.html.

EEE and West Nile virus, like other viral diseases affecting a horse's neurological system, must be reported to the state veterinarian at 609-671-6400 within 48 hours of diagnosis. The New Jersey Animal Health Diagnostic Laboratory is available to assist with EEE and WNV testing and can be reached at <jerseyvetlab@ag.nj.gov>. People can go online (https://www.jerseyvetlab.nj.gov) to learn more about the NJ Animal Health Diagnostic lab.

Two more horses in South Jersey have been euthanized after they contracted eastern equine encephalitis (EEE).

The New Jersey Department of Agriculture says an 8-year-old mare and a 7-year-old miniature horse stallion, both in Atlantic County, were the 2nd and 3rd cases of EEE, a serious mosquito-borne illness in horses, this year [2021].

Officials say the horses had not been vaccinated against EEE, and both were humanely euthanized due to severity of the disease.

In a statement, New Jersey Secretary of Agriculture Doug Fisher said, "These new cases of eastern equine encephalitis emphasize the importance of horse owners needing to vaccinate their animals to greatly reduce the chances of contracting EEE and West Nile virus."

Just last month [August 2021], a 7-year-old mare in Cumberland County was the 1st reported case of EEE. This mare had also not been vaccinated against EEE and was humanely euthanized on 19 Aug [2021].

According to the state, "EEE causes inflammation of the brain tissue and has a significantly higher risk of death in horses than West Nile virus (WNV), a serious viral disease affecting a horse's neurological system. The diseases are transmitted by a mosquito bite. The virus cycles between birds and mosquitoes, with horses and humans being incidental hosts. EEE infections in horses are not a significant risk factor for human infection because horses (like humans) are "dead-end" hosts for the virus."

EEE and WNV must be reported to the state veterinarian at (609) 671-6400 within 48 hours of diagnosis. The New Jersey Animal Health Diagnostic Laboratory is available to assist with both viruses and can be reached at (609) 406-6999.

[Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) is carried by mosquitoes and is totally preventable with a vaccine. The vaccine is a combination vaccine and usually includes EEE and WEE (Western equine encephalitis), west Nile virus (WNV), and tetanus. Thus, there is a lot of value in this combination vaccine. As this is early September, some locations may need to repeat the vaccine in 3 months. Also, if this is the 1st time an animal is vaccinated, then it will need a 2nd vaccine in 2-3 weeks, and then a single shot in 3 months. Immunity to EEE wanes in 3-4 months. So, if you are in mosquito territory, such as by a coast or river, or a hurricane has come through, bringing more mosquitoes, it may be a good idea to re-vaccinate your horse. - Mod.TG]
