Zimbabwe Government Misses Anthrax Vaccination Target
-----------------------------------------------------
Lack of funding is preventing the Zimbabwe government from vaccinating cattle against anthrax this year [2012], an official said Monday [26 Nov 2012]. The government had targeted to vaccinate 800 000 cattle throughout the country but only half of the figure had been covered so far, Zimbabwe news agency New Ziana reported.

Veterinary Field Services Department deputy director Dr Chenjerai Njagu said that farmers have been encouraged to buy vaccines using their own resources. "This year the situation has not been good as the division of Veterinary Field Services failed to adequately vaccinate cattle as planned due to vaccine shortage emanating from financial constraints," he said.

The Zimbabwe government is battling to fund its operations due to budgetary constraints, which have left many departments under funded.

This has resulted in the country battling to contain anthrax, which continues to decimate cattle, wild animals, and has left hundreds of people needing treatment after consuming infected animals.

Dr Njangu said the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare was carrying out awareness campaigns to encourage people to report all sudden deaths of livestock and discouraging them from consuming the meat.

[Zimbabwe has some 5 million cattle. Last year, 2011, they vaccinated some 23 percent (1 218 872 animals out of 5 334 761 head). In 2009 and 2010 they managed to vaccinate only around 7.5 percent. In previous years it has been about half that number. The trick with controlling anthrax through vaccination is to have good surveillance and then target your vaccination on those areas at highest risk; i.e., within 5 Kms of known previous outbreaks. But if one has not been able to demonstrate the benefits of vaccination, the livestock owners neither report suspect cases nor put their hands in their pockets to pay for their own vaccine, assuming there are supplies available locally. In 2011 anthrax outbreaks were reported in Manicaland, Mashonaland, Mashonaland East, Mashonaland West, Masvingo, Matabeleland North, and Midlands. - Mod.MHJ
