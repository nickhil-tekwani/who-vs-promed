INFECTION CONTROL - GEORGIA, USA (2)
====================================
Date: Mon, 3 Jun 1996 08:54:00 -0400 (EDT)
From: "James P. Steinberg" <jstei02@emory.edu>

I am in infection control at Crawford Long Hospital of Emory University.
I have been a subscriber to ProMED-mail's Digest for a while and would love to
see more infection control issues discussed - or a separate list for infection
control. FYI, there is a session on infection control resources on the
internet at the APIC meeting being held this week in Atlanta.
At our institution, we don't have any unusual antibiotic resistant
organisms. We're starting to see an increase in VRE. I am very
concerned that nursing homes will become a major reservoir for VRE, just
like with MRSA. We recently screened 140 hospital admissions from nursing
homes and found 5/140 patients colonized with VRE (peri-rectal swabs done
at time of hospital admission). The patients were from 4 different
nursing homes. We plan to repeat this screening program in several
months. Sadly, there are no local guidelines for dealing with VRE in
nursing homes and inf. control practices in many institutions are poor to
nonexistent.
