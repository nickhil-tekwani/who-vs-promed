US health officials issued a safety warning on a specialty endoscope that has been linked to the transmission of a drug-resistant superbug known as carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, or CRE.

Federal regulators have uncovered new violations by the manufacturer of medical scopes recently linked to outbreaks of deadly "superbug" bacteria at US hospitals.

Olympus Corp. failed to alert regulators to a cluster of 16 infections in patients who underwent procedures with the company's scope in 2012, according to a warning letter posted online [Mon 17 Aug 2105] by the Food and Drug Administration [FDA]. Olympus did not report the problems to the FDA until 2015, when the company was already under scrutiny for a more recent series of outbreaks.

Medical device manufacturers are required to report serious device problems to the FDA within 30 days of learning about them. The infections reported to the company involved a bacterial strain called _Pseudomonas_, which can cause pneumonia, severe sickness and death in hospital patients.

Additionally, FDA inspectors found that the company has no standard procedure for promptly reporting serious problems with its devices, a requirement for medical device companies. The FDA inspected 4 company sites in Japan and the US between March and April this year [2015]. A spokesman for the Tokyo manufacturer said in a statement: "We are reviewing the FDA's warning letter so that we can provide the required response in a timely manner."

Medical scopes from Olympus were linked to infections of antibiotic-resistant bacteria at 2 separate Los Angeles hospitals earlier this year [2015]. Hospital staff at Cedars-Sinai and UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles] medical centers said the infections occurred despite following Olympus' instructions for cleaning the devices, known as duodenoscopes.

Olympus is the market leader for duodenoscopes in the US, accounting for about 85 percent of sales, according to the FDA. The specialized scopes consist of a flexible fiber-optic tube that is inserted down the throat into the stomach and small intestine to diagnose and treat conditions in the pancreas and bile ducts. The tip of the scope includes moveable instruments designed to remove tumors, gallstones, and other blockages. But this complex design also makes the instruments extremely difficult to clean. Bodily fluids and other debris can stay in the device's joints and crevices even after cleaning and disinfection. Since 2013, there have been eight outbreaks of antibiotic-resistant bacteria linked to the devices at U.S. hospitals, according to government figures.

The FDA also posted warning letters [Mon 17 Aug 2015] to 2 other scope manufacturers -- Hoya Corporation and Fujifilm Corporation -- citing problems with the testing, design, reporting and quality control of their devices. All of the letters are dated [12 Aug 2015]. The companies are given 15 business days to respond with their plans to fix the problems. Fujifilm said in a statement that it "takes the issue very seriously and is working closely with FDA." Hoya Corp. did not immediately respond to a request for comment [Mon 17 Aug 2015].

The FDA previously disclosed that Olympus did not seek federal clearance for the latest version of its duodenoscope, which it began selling in 2010. Despite these problems, the FDA previously ruled it would keep the devices on the market because they fill an important need in a half-million procedures performed each year.

[The FDA has issued a report on 4 Aug 2015 on supplemental measures to enhance duodenoscope reprocessing between patient use that is available at http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/AlertsandNotices/ucm454766.htm. These measures to help reduce the risk of infection transmission associated with the use of duodenoscopes include:
- microbiological culturing;
- ethylene oxide [EtO] sterilization;
- use of a liquid chemical sterilant processing system;
- repeat high-level disinfection

This FDA document says, "Since it does not rely on heat, EtO gas sterilization may be an effective method for heat-sensitive instruments, like duodenoscopes, that can be damaged by high temperatures. Following cleaning and high-level disinfection, EtO is an additional measure that may eliminate the presence of micro-organisms on a device through the introduction of EtO gas."

"It is critical that devices are meticulously cleaned and disinfected prior to EtO sterilization. Gas sterilization with ethylene oxide may fail in the presence of viable microorganisms after inadequate cleaning and disinfection."

Olympus Corp. has validated the efficacy and compatibility of EtO gas for sterilization of their endoscopes (http://medical.olympusamerica.com/sites/us/files/pdf/ETO_Letter.pdf).

Following an outbreak of infections due to antibiotic-resistant Gram negative bacilli linked to use of duodenoscopes at UCLA, which contributed to the deaths of 2 patients, university officials began sterilizing duodenoscopes using EtO and no new infections have occurred since it made the change (http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-ucla-outbreak-20150224-story.html).

The following is extracted from my moderator comments in ProMED-mail post Antibiotic-resistant Enterobacteriaceae - USA (05) ERCP endoscopes, FDA, update 20150517.3368314:

The FDA has said that it received 142 adverse event reports of contaminated endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) duodenoscopes and possible patient infections since 2010 (ProMED-mail post Antibiotic-resistant Enterobacteriaceae - USA (04) ERCP endoscopes, update 20150513.3358689). However, the number of patients involved could be far higher than 142 because one adverse event report may include numerous people. In addition, the number of cases is likely even higher, because ERCP duodenoscopes can transfer all types of pathogens, including antibiotic-susceptible bacteria and viruses, like hepatitis B and C, which may have been overlooked, whereas CRE (carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae) are more likely to be noticed because they are multidrug resistant, and the infections are more likely to be fatal.

For a discussion of problems with ERCP duodenoscopes, please see the moderator's comments in prior ProMED-mail posts on this subject listed below.
