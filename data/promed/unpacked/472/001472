Alice, Texas...The Health Department's fourth annual airborne assault on
rabies has been delayed by bad weather across South Texas.
Two specially equipped planes to be used in the massive airdrop from the
Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources were delayed in their arrival in
Alice, where the six-week project was scheduled to begin today.
The airdrop is part of multi-year plan to eradicate rabies carried by foxes
and coyotes. Since the first vaccine airdrop in 1995, there's been a 98
percent decline in cases of animal rabies in South Texas. In Central Texas,
there's been a 93 percent decline in gray fox rabies since an airdrop in
1996. Over the next six weeks, the planes will drop some 2.6 million
vaccine-laden baits over 66 counties in South, West and Central Texas.
