After a very quiet 2nd week of June [2015] with no new cases of avian influenza or "bird flu" reported in Iowa, a 6th confinement in Wright County was found to be contaminated on 16 Jun 2015. One million egg-laying chickens had to be destroyed.

The total number of chickens, turkeys, and ducks in Iowa that have been euthanized is now over 31.5 million at 76 locations in 18 counties. In Wright County, the total is a bit over 7.3 million birds killed.

Wright County's losses:
Location no. 1: 2 821 787 layers
Location no. 2: 1 106 530 layers
Location no. 3: 950 000 pullets
Location no. 4: 991 509 layers
Location no. 5: 436 112 pullets
Location no. 6: 1 000 000 layers (est.)

The loss of so many egg-laying chickens across the state has led to an increase in the price of eggs. The price of a dozen has doubled to USD 3 or more. Locally, egg producers are no longer providing free hen fruit [eggs] for non-profit fundraisers like the Knights of Columbus and the Belmond Fire Department.

Some folks are speculating that turkey prices will be up and supplies down at Thanksgiving [26 Nov 2015].

For the remainder of 2015, all bird shows at county fairs and the state fair [13-23 Aug 2015] have been cancelled in an effort to slow the spread of the disease.

The disease has been found in 15 states so far. No cases of bird flu have been found in Hancock, Franklin, or Humboldt Counties [Iowa].

According to Wright County Economic Development Director Bryce Davis, bird flu has been responsible for a large number of employee layoffs at poultry confinements. This has resulted in a loss of earnings of about USD 1 million in Wright County. Fortunately, these workers are eligible for 26 weeks of unemployment benefits. It remains to be seen if this is enough time to clean up the 6 contaminated confinements in Wright County, repopulate the buildings with chickens, and get people working again.

How the bird flu may affect local farmers is harder to predict. A chicken eats about a bushel of corn each year, so in Wright County that would mean about 7.3 million bushels, or 600 000 per month. However, there is always a need for corn in other industries, and grain prices fluctuate often according to weather and yields. Iowa farmers grow 2.4 billion bushels of corn every year, and all of Iowa's 67 million chickens consume less than 3 percent of that of corn.

[Although not specified in this article there is little doubt that the avian influenza strain is H5N2. It surrounds this case.

This seems to be the disease that just won't go away! At about the time we all take a breath, we have new cases popping up. Why is that? What contamination is being tracked, trucked, carried, blown back in to a poultry house? All possible avenues of how that disease came in to the house should be thoroughly investigated. - Mod.TG
