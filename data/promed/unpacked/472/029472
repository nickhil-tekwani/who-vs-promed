European bats have been identified as reservoir hosts for leishmania parasites in Spain. Leishmaniasis is a horrific disease caused by approximately 20 species of protozoan kinetoplastid parasites from the _Leishmania_ genus. The parasites are transmitted from host to host via sandflies (Phlebotomines).

Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is endemic to the Mediterranean basin, including Spain (and its islands), due to the distribution of appropriate sandfly vectors, host species, and suitable climatic conditions. _Leishmania infantum_ is the most prevalent causative agent of the disease in Spain, where the main vectors are _Phlebotomus ariasi_ and _P. perniciosus_.

As well as humans, _L. infantum_ has been shown to infect dogs, which also act as reservoirs of infection. However, in recent years animal species have been investigated as reservoir hosts, and a [wide variety] of wildlife has shown the presence of _L. infantum_ infections, such as foxes, wolves, wild cats, bears, rats, hedgehogs, squirrels, jackals, genets, mice, martens, minks, rabbits, and hares.

In the last decade, several studies have looked at the role of bats as potential hosts for certain _Leishmania_ species in Mexico, Brazil, and Ethiopia. All studies found bats infected with _Leishmania_ spp., highlighting the relevance of these mammals as possible hosts of _Leishmania_ spp. In different parts of the world.

There are 45 species of bat living across Europe, making their homes in urban and rural environments alike. However, it hadn't yet been determined whether bats in Europe were infected with _Leishmania_ spp., and so Iris Azami-Conesca and her colleagues aimed to find out if this were so.

During their study, they attempted to detect the presence of _L. infantum_ DNA in the common pipistrelle bat (_Pipistrellus pipistrellus_) from around Madrid. Samples of spleen, abdominal hair, and blood clots from the heart were aseptically collected from naturally deceased bats, from the wildlife recovery centre.

Overall, 16 of the 27 (59.2%) pipistrelle bats tested positive for _L. infantum_ in at least one sampled site (spleen, hair, or blood clot). The team discovered that samples from the spleen gave the highest number of positive results (14), as well as the highest sensitivity for detecting the parasite (87%). They also revealed that the specificity for detecting _L. infantum_ using this PCR method was 100%.

This report by Azami-Conesca and colleagues is the first to have shown that European bats are suitable hosts of _L. infantum_ in Spain. This is an important discovery as pipistrelle bats are the most common bat in urban and peri-urban areas, where they live in close proximity to human populations, and probably play and important role in the life cycle of this parasite. In addition, they could contribute to transmission of _L. infantum_ to humans, as well as to wild and domesticated animals.

The pipistrelle bat is one of the commonest bats in Europe, and so these findings are expected to have implications for leishmaniasis control in the whole of Europe, as well as just Spain. The findings of these researchers may subsequently help to establish or adapt leishmaniasis control measures across Europe, which is expected to be needed in light of a potential increase in vector-borne diseases in coming years due to global warming.

Leishmania has also been found in bats in leishmania endemic areas of Brazil (Ludiele S Castro et al. Castro LS, Dorval MEC, Matheus LMD, et al.

The transmission from a host animal to other animals or humans depends on bites by the sandfly and how important the bat reservoir is for maintaining a leishmania focus in a given area is not known. - Mod.EP
