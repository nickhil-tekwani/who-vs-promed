Huge sums of money are being lost to black spot which has attacked acres of orange farms. Groves are hard-hit by the fungal disease. In parts of the Eastern Region, almost 50% of orange trees are affected. Since black spot is airborne it spreads fast and nearby farms are at risk. Fungicides are used by the growers but are very expensive.

A manager of 1500 acres of orange groves for the Eastern regional chapter of the Orange Growers Association (OGA) said the government should declare black spot a national problem. Urgent help is needed through the Agriculture Ministry and key stakeholders by supporting the farmers with mass spraying or subsidised fungicides. This will promote disease-free oranges and contribute to reviving Ghanaian agribusiness.

[Citrus black spot (CBS) caused by the fungus _Phyllosticta citricarpa_ (previously _Guignardia citricarpa_) is one of the most serious diseases of crops in Asia and regions of the southern hemisphere. Symptoms can occur on leaves but are most severe on fruit. They include sunken lesions of varying size, shape and colour, depending on stage of fruit or leaf development. The disease may also lead to post-harvest losses since fruit may not show visible symptoms while on the tree. However, characteristic lesions may develop in storage under suitable conditions. Fungal strains which do not cause symptoms also exist. CBS causes significant losses due to premature fruit and leaf drop, as well as disfiguration of fruit for fresh markets.

Spores are produced under fallen leaves and sometimes on fruit. Spread occurs by air currents, on contaminated plant material (including nursery plants or scions with latent infections) and by mechanical means. The disease is particularly virulent late in the season; losses tend to be most severe in late maturing varieties. All commercial citrus cultivars are susceptible to varying extents, except for sour orange (_Citrus aurantium_). Disease management includes fungicides, phytosanitation and pathogen exclusion. Once established in a region, eradication of a sporulating fungus such as _P. citricarpa_ is considered impossible.

CBS was introduced into the USA by unknown means (2010; ProMED-mail post 20100412.1183), illustrating the risk to citrus industries worldwide. In Europe, large numbers of quarantine detections (ProMED post 20131204.2090761) implied that certification of disease freedom at point of origin was not working effectively; stricter EU regulations were introduced (see ProMED-mail post 20150714.3509850), but do not appear to have eliminated the risk effectively (ProMED posts 20200706.7547037, 20210315.8249494).

The related _P. solitaria_ causes leaf and fruit blotch of pome fruits.
