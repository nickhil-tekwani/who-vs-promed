A total of 3 children have died and more than 50 others are seriously
ill in Peru after eating a school meal contaminated with pesticide,
officials say. The children were being fed by a government nutrition
programme for the poor, at a remote mountain village in the north of
the country.

It is thought the meal of rice and fish was prepared in a container
which may have previously held rat poison.

At least 3 adults have also been taken ill.

The mass poisoning happened in the village of Redondo in the Cajamarca
region, about 750 km (470 mi) north of the capital, Lima.

The 3 dead were between 6 and 10 years old.

The food had been donated by the National Food Assistance Programme,
which gives food to schools in the poorest parts of the country.

The mother of one of the children who died said they showed signs of
having been poisoned. "I think it was poison because all the kids are
purple, from all parts of the school," said the mother, who was not
named. "My little boy has died. My 9-year-old boy has died."

Peruvian health official Miguel Zumaeta said the incident "looks like
it was a carbonates intoxication, which means rat poison."

Prosecutors and health ministry officials are investigating how the
meal became tainted.

In a similar case in 1999, 24 children died in a village near Cusco in
southern Peru after eating food contaminated by pesticide.

[The food used does not seem to be the source of the poison, according
to this article. This article states it was the utensils used to
prepare the food.

This is a little odd. How could a rodenticide not be noticed in and on
the utensils? It would need to have been a substantial amount to
poison this many people in a presumably short time. I cannot help but
wonder, what are signs of poisoning? The signs and symptoms differ
depending upon what the toxin is. A purple hue does not sound like
rodenticides. Rodenticides are generally anticoagulants and cause
bleeding. A purple color sounds more like sodium nitrate poisoning.
Nitrate has been mistaken for salt and has caused poisoning and loss
of life in other situations. - Mod.TG]
