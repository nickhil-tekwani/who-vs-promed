Russian specialists have discovered a new virus that causes fever symptoms. According to Izvestia, the new pathogen was named Manych after the Manych River in southern Russia. The virus was found in blood serum samples from people from medical institutions in the Rostov region with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF).

According to experts, Manych can be infected from a tick bite. At the same time, together with CCHF, it is capable of causing a viral infection in humans with manifestations characteristic of fever. The main symptoms of fever are chills and a high temperature of about 39 deg C [102 deg F].

Manych, according to scientists, is closely related to the Jingmen tick virus (JMTV), which Chinese scientists discovered in 2014 in the salivary glands of various tick species. The peculiarity of viruses of this group is that their genome is divided into 4 segments, and for reproduction in the host cell, all 4 particles must combine.

According to the infectious disease doctor, chief physician of Invitro-Siberia, Andrei Pozdnyakov, in this way the virus can escape from the body's immune response.

As experts noted, so far Manych does not pose a danger to people. However, it is possible that this virus can mutate and become dangerous.

[According to additional details translated from a report in Russian: "In 4 out of 20 cases, the infection was different from typical, on the basis of which the experts concluded that the patients had contracted the new virus" and "At the moment, the virus does not pose a particular danger because it is not widespread. It is detected in isolated cases, mainly after tick bites. There is also no data on the detection of the Manych virus in regions of the country, in addition to southern Russia" (https://don24.ru/rubric/zdorove/novyy-virus-manych-vyyavili-v-rostovskoy-oblast-u-pacientov-s-ukusami-kleschey.html).

"Jingmen tick virus (JMTV) is carried by the same ticks as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus. All CCHF cases are recorded mainly in the Stavropol territory and in the Rostov region; tick collection is also carried out mainly in these regions.... This virus is closely related to JMTV and was discovered by chance, since, as is customary, the material was examined to identify all possible pathogens with a clinical picture similar to CCHF.... Previously, scientists have proven that viruses of the JMTV complex can cause monoinfection in humans.

"'According to other studies, JMTV causes a local inflammatory reaction at the site of the bite,' noted Andrei Pozdnyakov, infectious disease doctor, chief physician of Invitro-Siberia. It is likely that these viruses cause fever as well. The work of specialists from 'Vector' claims that this virus is already present in ticks on the territory of the Russian Federation. But as long as it is transmitted through tick bites, this will not be a big problem. If it starts to be transmitted through mosquito bites (so far there are no prerequisites for this), the problem will become greater, and if it starts to be transmitted by airborne droplets, it will be really dangerous. After all, the question of the problematic nature of any microorganism is not only in its pathogenicity, but also in its infectiousness, and in the transmission mechanism" (https://iz.ru/1216848/olga-kolentcova/eshche-kleshchi-v-vektore-obnaruzhili-novyi-virus-vyzyvaiushchii-likhoradku).

A new multicomponent RNA virus called Jingmen tick virus (JMTV) was first discovered in various tick species collected in the Chinese provinces of Hubei and Zhejiang and reported in 2014. JMTV was most commonly found in _Rhipicephalus microplus_ ticks collected from dogs and cows. JMTV was later reported in Uganda, Guinea, Europe and the provinces bordering Russia in northern China. The JMTV genome is divided into 4 segments, the size of which ranges from 2751 to 3072 nucleotides. The total genome size is 11 401 nucleotides.

The discovery of the genetic material of the JMTV virus in various species of mosquitoes, ticks, mammals, including primates, suggested that multicomponent flaviviruses are capable of crossing the species barrier and infecting mammals.

Also, JMTV RNA was first detected in blood serum samples from 3 patients with CCHF in Kosovo (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2018.07.010). These data suggested that the JMTV and Alongshan viruses can successfully replicate in human tissues and participate in the pathogenesis of the development of various tick-borne viral infections after a tick bite.

Additionally, "the viruses of the JMTV group (and Manych in particular) have a peculiarity: their genome is divided into 4 segments, each of which is 'packed' into a separate viral particle. All 4 particles must fuse in the host cell for the virus to multiply. The known viruses pathogenic for humans and animals do not have such a feature."

"The path of the emergence of a dangerous pathogen, when it first circulates in the animal population, then evolves in close contact with humans and becomes able to be transmitted from person to person, is quite standard, according to a leading researcher at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology at Moscow State University, M.V. Lomonosov Roman Zinovkin.... According to Roman Zinovkin, this feature only makes it difficult for the virus to reproduce. However, Andrei Pozdnyakov suggested that in this way the virus could escape from the body's immune response" (https://iz.ru/1216848/olga-kolentcova/eshche-kleshchi-v-vektore-obnaruzhili-novyi-virus-vyzyvaiushchii-likhoradku).

The available data on the genetic diversity and taxonomy of viruses in the JMTV complex are still very limited. This does not allow for a more detailed assessment of the geographic features of these viruses. But even the available data show that JMTV actually spreads globally. There are no data on the detection of the Manych virus in regions other than southern Russia yet. However, it is too early to talk about the potential danger posed by this new virus; therefore, it is imperative to continue to study this new virus. - Mod.UBA
