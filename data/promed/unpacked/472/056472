The South African Press Association has reported the culling of at least
500 buffalo infected with tuberculosis in Kruger National Park. This
activity, reportedly using poisoned darts, was concentrated in the
northern, southern, and central areas of the park.
A coordinator of the culling, J. J. van Altena, was quoted as saying that
the culling had been going on for a few weeks. There are about 20,000
buffalo in the park, according to park staff.
Kruger park authorities have been trying to establish the level of
infection and the spread of tuberculosis because lions in the park eating
infected buffalo carcasses were contracting tuberculisis. The disease
reportedly had spread to cheetah, at least one leopard, kudu and baboons.
About one month ago, 32 of 33 lions in south of the Sabie River were
confirmed as having tuberculosis. [A presentation made at the Five Disease
Congress, held in the Kruger Park in early August, announced the number as
33 out of 35 lions immobilized and tested. The presentation included the
information that confirmation of _Mycobacterium bovis_ by bacterial
isolation and PCR analysis. RFLP analysis of samples from 9 lions
identified the DNA patterns in the lions to be identical to the pattern
found in a majority of park buffaloes.-DP
Johan Krige, Deputy Director of the Department of Agriculture said in late
September that lions in the park were being "ravaged by an incurable and
deadly bovine strain of tuberculosis which could kill them all. According
to a study done at the University of Pretoria, lions have no natural
resistance to the disease. The lion population in the Kruger is estimated
at over 1,000.
