A total of 51 pilot whales have died after becoming stranded on a beach on the Chatham Islands off New Zealand, the BBC reports. The mass stranding means more than 200 whales have died in separate incidents over the past week [24-30 Nov 2018] in the region.

New Zealand's Department of Conservation says between 80 and 90 whales were found to have become stranded in Hanson Bay on Thursday [29 Nov 2018]. Several dozen managed to refloat themselves, but 50 were found dead and one had to be put down.

[Mass strandings of cetaceans are considered to be owing to a complex set of variables in which behavioral factors are probably important. In these phenomena, there are interactions of physical conditions (weather, tides, currents, coastline) and biological conditions (predators, feeding, disturbance of echolocation and disease), and they are also affected by red tide toxins.
