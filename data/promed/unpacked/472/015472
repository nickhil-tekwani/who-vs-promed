The Mauritanian Ministry of Livestock announced on Wednesday [2 Nov 2022] that the number of confirmed cases of Rift Valley fever [RVF] in livestock has reached 305 cases in 8 wilayat [regions, administrative divisions].

In this update, 8 regions reported RVF in livestock: Guidimakha, Assaba, Adrar, Hodh el Gharbi, Hodh el Chargui, Tagant, Trarza, and Tiris Zemmour. In its daily bulletin, the ministry said that this result was obtained after the analysis of 1567 samples.

[Between 30 Aug and 17 Oct 2022, a total of 47 confirmed human cases of RVF, mostly among animal breeders, including 23 deaths, have been reported from 9 of Mauritania's 15 wilayas (regions). Circulation of the virus that causes RVF in animals (small ruminants, camels and cattle) has been confirmed in 8 wilayas of Mauritania. Altogether, 12 wilayas have reported confirmed human or animal cases, including 9 that share borders with 3 neighboring countries -- Mali, Senegal and Algeria. A One Health approach is being used to manage the epidemic response (see post Rift Valley fever - Mauritania (09): human, livestock, WHO 20221021.8706288. - Mod.SF

As of 10 Oct 2022, a total of 1148 samples of animal origin -- cattle, camel, and small ruminants -- were analyzed, of which 277 tested positive (24.1%). According to the current update, since then 419 additional animals have been sampled/tested, the total figures becoming 1567 and 305, respectively (19.4% positive). The outbreak may have peaked.

Camels have, reportedly, been earlier suspected to be the main source of human infection.

Item 2, published on 23 Oct 2022, presents additional information on the current and previous RVF events in Mauritania. - Mod.AS].

Mauritania has become since 1987 a place of spread of RVF. It has just hit the country since August 2022 with more than 10 human deaths [see Mod.SF commentary to item 1 above, addressing updated figures] and several hundred livestock deaths. The Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Livestock supported by the WHO and the FAO are trying to stem the evil. However, the awareness-information aspect through the actors of the pastoral sector, as well as the involvement of civil society, are considered essential to stop this silent killer. It was in August 2022 that the 1st cases of RVF were reported in Mauritania, a country which has already suffered waves of invasion in 1998, 2003, 2010, 2012, 2015 and 2020, after a first appearance in 1987. This African viral zoonosis, mainly affects ruminant domestic animals (cattle, sheep, goats, camels, etc.). It can be transmitted to humans by exposure to an infected animal, or to a contaminated animal product, sometimes by mosquito bites. It manifests as a fever, often hemorrhagic in animals and sometimes (1 to 3% of cases) in humans.

Faced with the seriousness of the disease and the growing number of fatal cases in both animals and humans, with 17 deaths recorded including a girl in Atar, the public authorities called on the FAO, which dispatched 3 experts, in addition to the assistance provided by WHO. FAO experts met with all the stakeholders, health authorities and livestock executives, breeders' federation, livestock markets, etc. The National Institute for Public Health Research (INRSP), a reference laboratory, has already carried out several tests, including the one carried out on 29 Sep 2022 on 131 people with 30 positive cases. The Crisis Committee chaired by the Prime Minister thus insisted on raising awareness among farmers and populations.

Alongside the measures taken by the authorities in the field of screening and diagnosis, but also in relation to the preventive measures aimed at isolating sick animals and the vaccines distributed to farmers, civil society has also been heavily involved in this operation. A group of NGOs comprising AMAMI, ActionDev, LCP, GAMM, ADIG, GLOBE and AJPED, have published a press release on 19 Oct 2022 in which they asked the public authorities and development partners "to come to aid to a population whose food is essentially made up of animal products, meat and milk." According to these organizations, "this disease has a negative impact on the food and nutritional situation of vulnerable populations in the country, especially women and children already weakened by the effects of COVID-19, soaring prices and climate change. Their role in sensitizing and informing herders and populations could constitute, according to observers, a major turning point in the fight against the disease.

The nomadic nature of West African populations, especially Mauritanian populations, makes the large-scale risks even more compelling and worrying. Indeed, the experts are of the opinion that the movement of herds in search of water and pasture, especially uncontrolled cross-border transhumance, can further increase the risks of contamination between countries, namely Mauritania, Mali and Senegal. Hence the calls for strengthening interregional cooperation for the surveillance, prevention and control of Rift Valley Fever disease.

[The maintenance mechanism of RVF virus in Mauritania is under study. According to a recent paper, evidence of RVFV was found in mosquitoes collected in 2018. It was demonstrated that mosquitoes feed on fruit bats, which "are suspected to be involved in RVFV maintenance" (20220419.8702716). In order to gain a thorough understanding of RVFV ecology and the virus maintenance, further studies are required. - Mod.AS.
