Comment on Schistosomiasis - Uganda
-----------------------------------
Although 3 species of Schistosoma are known to infect humans in
Uganda, most studies have focused on the local epidemiology of
Schistosoma mansoni. The following background data are abstracted from
the Gideon e-book series. [1-4] (primary references are available on
request).

Schistosoma intercalatum:
-------------------------
Schistosoma intercalatum infection is reported in Arua, Gulu, Maracha
and the Albert Nile region.

Schistosoma haematobium:
------------------------
Schistosoma haematobium infection is endemic to the north, East
(Mbale area), northern shore of Lake Victoria and area north of Lake
Kyoga.

A study published in 2007 found that 17 percent of persons
seroconverted toward Schistosoma mansoni and/or Schistosoma
haematobium following recreational exposure to the Upper Nile River.
The local snail reservoir is Bulinus tropicus.

Schistosoma mansoni:
--------------------
Schistosoma mansoni infection was 1st reported in Uganda in 1902, in
Arua district. The disease is endemic to the north, East (Mbale area),
northern shore of Lake Victoria and area north of Lake Kyoga.

Transmission is limited to areas with rainfall greater than 900 mm
per year. Disease prevalence rates and intensity increase with age,
peaking in the age group 10 to 20 years (1998 to 2002).

Prevalence surveys: 4.1 percent of children ages 10 to 15 (Kampala,
1997 publication), 92.6 percent of schools in proximity to Lake
Victoria (at least one infected child, 2009 publication).

More than 50 percent of school children living in proximity to Lake
Victoria (1998 to 2002). 20.4 percent of school children nationwide,
with a male/female ratio of 1.22/1 (1998 to 2002). 42.4 percent of
school children in 2003; 26.8 percent in 2004; 17.9 percent in 2005
(nationwide). 44.3 percent of school children in northwest and
southeast Uganda (2002 to 2003).

27.8 percent of school children near high altitude (greater than 1400
meters) crater lakes in western Uganda (2008 publication). 18.1
percent of school children in the Great Lakes region of Uganda,
Tanzania, Kenya and Burundi (2010 publication). 44.3 percent of
preschool children and 60.0 percent of their mothers near Lake Albert,
16.0 percent of preschool children and 29.2 percent of their mothers
near Lake Victoria (2010 publication). 47.5 percent of preschool
children in Bugoigo, Lake Albert region (2011 publication).

27.2 percent of children and 47.6 percent of their mothers (2010
publication). 47 percent of children below age 3 years living on the
Ugandan shore of Lake Victoria (2006 publication). 72 percent of the
population of Butiaba, Lake Albert (1996 to 1997). 65 percent of
persons ages 10 to 20 years in Walukuba Division, Jinja District (2009
publication). 86 percent in Buboigo and Walakuba, 92 percent in Booma
and 91 percent in Piida (Lake Albert region, 2006 publication). 18.3
percent of otherwise healthy pregnant women at enrolment to a trial of
deworming (Entebbe, 2007 publication). 18 percent of pregnant women
(Entebbe and Katabi, 2003 to 2005). 18 percent of pregnant women
(Entebbe, 2010 publication). 3.7 percent of pregnant women in Masindi
District (2003 to 2004)

Seroprevalence surveys:
-----------------------
90 percent of semi-captive wild-born chimpanzees on an island
sanctuary in Lake Victoria (2011 publication).

Reservoirs:
-----------
Local snail reservoirs include Biomphalaria pfeifferi, Biomphalaria
sudanica, Biomphalaria stanleyi and Biomphalaria choanomphala
