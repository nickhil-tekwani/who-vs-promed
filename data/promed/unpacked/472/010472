Outbreaks of Ebola fever in Kasai Occidental - Dr. Eugenie Misenga
criticizes the consumption of primates
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1st the factor considered dangerous by Mrs. Dr. Eugenie Misenga, the
origin of the resurgence of Ebola haemorrhagic fever in the province
of Kasai Occidental, is linked to the consumption of some animal
species that feed in the rain forest in particular, monkeys from the
race of primates such as the Bonobo.

To this effect, Dr. Eugenie Misenga, the Medical Director of the
Hospital Center of Kananga, criticized the consumption of these
animals as they are often carriers of Ebola viral fever which the
only treatment available is symptomatic.

A total of 6 suspected cases were identified and taken to the
Hospital Center of Kananga for treatment by Dr. Eugenie Misenga. The
suspected cases are in good health for the moment.

Against all odds, Dr. Eugenie apologized to the population of Kasanga
who like to eat the game meat from monkeys. "Whether the monkey meat
is fresh or is smoked the risk of the presence of the vector [virus]
responsible for Ebola hemorrhagic fever is imminent," said Dr. Eugenie.

It is in this perspective that she thinks to put a mechanism for
information to prevent the constant danger which threatens the
population of Kasai Occidental in general and the population of
Kananga in particular.

Taking into account the fact that there are some suspected cases [of
Ebola hemorrhagic fever] admitted to the [Hospital Center], it should
be noted that the Kananga hospital complex lacks a bit of
everything. It is abnormal for a teaching hospital that receives
several suspected cases [of Ebola hemorrhagic fever]. There is no
potable water, let alone electricity and essential drugs.

In addition, one notes a state of advanced deterioration of the
hospital, which dates back to 1954.

However, Dr. Eugenie Misenga said that the Kananga hospital complex
[treats] an average of 1000 patients per month. Among these, 600 are
outpatients, only 300 patients are admitted [to the hospital] and 100
women are admitted for [obstetric] deliveries, according to a
dispatch received by our [La Prosperite] editorial staff.

The hospital situation [report] indicates a low utilization of public
health services despite a large increasing demography in recent
years, with the population of the town of Kananga reaching the
threshhold of 1 200 000 inhabitants.

The medical director, facing the inconvenience pointed out that
national and international opinion should remember there were 2
natural disasters that had shaken the Kasai Occidental in 2007. There
was a rail accident in Kakenge and the outbreak of of Ebola
haemorrhagic fever in Kapungu village, located 200 km [124 miles]
from Kananga city. These 2 events occurred while the hospital had no
medicines available for urgent interventions.

[The above newswire mentions 6 suspected cases of Ebola hemorrhagic
fever presently admitted to the hospital in Kananga, the provincial
capital of Kasai Occidental in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
not far from where there have been prior outbreaks of Ebola
hemorrhagic fever in the past (see references below). No clinical
symptoms of the cases are given, nor is there mention of any
fatalities at present, making it very difficult to comment on
possible diagnoses to be considered. In addition, information of the
localities of origin of the cases is not given.

That being said, it is an area in which there have been outbreaks of
serious infectious diseases in the past few years, including the
viral hemorrhagic fevers, monkeypox and pneumonic plague (see below).
The advisory to avoid eating primate meat, a practice that has been
associated with transmission of the viral hemorrhagic fevers in
Africa, leads one to suspect that the clinical picture includes
hemorrhagic manifestations.

More information from knowledgeable sources would be greatly appreciated.
