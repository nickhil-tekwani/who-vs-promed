A Comment on West Nile Virus Surveillance in Hawaii
---------------------------------------------------
[In the ProMED-mail post archived as "West Nile virus, avian - USA
(HI) (03): NOT 20041001.2705", the Moderator asked for information on
the circumstances surrounding this incident and why it was considered
appropriate to test this bird for West Nile virus infection.
Dr.Thierry Work has provided the following explanation - Mod.CP]

Since the entry of West Nile virus (WNV) into the US in 1999 and its
impact on wild birds, the conservation community in Hawaii has been
very concerned that if WNV gets into the state, the impacts to native
avifauna such as endangered crows and raptors could be catastrophic
(not to mention the probable negative effects on tourism). To reduce
the chances of the virus getting here, several strategies have been
adopted.

1) The US Fish and Wildlife Service heads an interagency working
group that has been working on ways to prevent WNV from reaching
Hawaii. These measures include convincing the US Postal Service to
stop mailing birds into Hawaii without agricultural inspections,
beefing up state quarantine procedures for avian imports, and working
with the Hawaii Department of Health (DOH) to enhance mosquito and
dead bird surveillance. Current efforts are focused on developing a
coherent incident command structure so that a swift response can be
implemented should the virus get here.

2) Since 2002, the US Geological Survey has been taking weekly blood
samples from wild finches, sparrows, and doves around Honolulu
International Airport, Barber's Point, and Dillingham airfields. The
USDA Wildlife Services captures these birds around airports to
mitigate aircraft bird strike hazards. The USGS is bleeding these
birds in efforts to detect WNV activity in areas considered high risk
for entry of the virus into the state. The samples were being tested
with the blocking ELISA at Orange County Vector Control District;
however, because resources in California are being redirected to WNV
problems there, the Hawaii DOH began testing bird sera using the IgM
ELISA.

3) In efforts to expand testing to other areas of considered high
risk for WNV entry into Hawaii, the USGS trained Hawaii DOH personnel
to bleed birds at Kahului Airport on Maui. The bird that turned up
suspect positive was bled on 20 Sep 2004 during that training
session. Weekly serosurveillance and testing of birds continues in
Maui and Honolulu.

4) Orange County Vector Control District is working with Hawaii DOH
to develop their capacity to use the blocking ELISA in Hawaii.
Efforts are also afoot to try and develop confirmatory capabilities
for WNV in Hawaii thereby reducing response times.
