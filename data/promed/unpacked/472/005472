A 14-year-old Texas girl was finally cured of an oft-fatal emerging disease when doctors amputated her lower leg, where the infection arose, after various antimicrobials proved ineffective. The culprit was _Pythium insidiosum_, a fungus-like microbe which rarely causes disease in humans and then primarily in Thailand. The case "clearly highlights the need for clinicians to have the best support possible from the clinical microbiology lab," says Don Murphey of Cook Children's Medical Center, who served as attending physician during the case. The case report is published in the April 2012 Journal of Clinical Microbiology.

The girl, otherwise healthy, presented to an urgent care facility with a 2-week history of a continuously enlarging erythematous bump on her lower leg, having reported recently swimming in an algae-filled pool. "Over the course of several weeks, what started as a very small lesion grew to involve most of her leg," says 1st author Stephen J. Salipante, of the University of Washington, Seattle. "Initial cultures of the wound suggested that this was a bacterial infection, and it was treated as such, but without success."

"She eventually needed to be hospitalized," says Salipante. Her treatment team at Cook Children's hospital tried increasingly aggressive medical and surgical management, including different antibiotic regimens, antifungals, and surgical debridements, but the infection simply didn't respond. "Given the microscopic appearance of the organism, our working hypothesis was that this was some kind of unusual, and very aggressive fungus," says Salipante.

However, sequencing a segment of DNA that is useful for categorizing fungi, the ITS1 sequence, "revealed that this was not a fungus at all, rather, the DNA sequence very closely matched _P. insidiosum_," says Salipante. This microbe has long been known to be a veterinary pathogen, primarily affecting horses and dogs, disfiguring them, often fatally. Only about 150 human cases have been reported in the literature, nearly all of them in Thailand. "Needless to say, this was an unexpected result, as this young woman had not left Texas," says Salipante.

But "this organism did not demonstrate sensitivity in vitro to any of the antifungals or antimicrobials that had some activity for other isolates," says Murphey. Efforts at treatment even included trying an experimental therapeutic vaccine for Pythium-afflicted horses," says Murphey. "When it became clear to all of us that we were not going to clear the advancing local infection, we went on to amputation."

The amputation "undoubtedly saved this young woman's life," says Salipante. Now, nearly 6 months later, there is no vestige of infection.

"Pythiosis is believed to be an emerging human pathogen, meaning that the numbers of cases are expected to go up in the future," says Salipante.

"We have demonstrated that molecular identification by PCR screening and DNA sequencing provides a strategy to allow definitive identification of a range of pathogens, even unsuspected ones," says Salipante.

"DNA sequencing is a not just a tool for discovery anymore; it provides critical data for making decisions impacting patient care," says coauthor Brad T. Cookson of the University of Washington. "I would add that medical care currently offers patients something very special; our report demonstrates the vitality and utility of collaborative, trans-disciplinary approaches for solving challenging medical problems."

[Pythiosis is an uncommon cutaneous/subcutaneous, gastrointestinal, or multi-systemic disease caused by a water mold. It has been reported in dogs, horses, cats, cattle, humans and a captive zoo bear.10 Cases have predominantly been documented worldwide in tropical, subtropical and other wet, warm climates. Recent emergence of pythiosis in more temperate regions suggests that the disease is more widespread than previously suspected. Horses are most commonly affected followed by dogs and, rarely, cats.

Pythiosis was caused by the aquatic pathogen_ Pythium insidiosum_ in every reported case of mammalian disease.10 There are nearly 85 species of _Pythium_, most of which are parasites of plants, fish, and crustaceans.10 An as yet undetermined species of _Lagenidium_ is responsible for lagenidiosis in dogs.4 The genus _Lagenidium_ includes more than 50 species of which most are natural parasites of algae, fungi, rotifers, nematodes, crustaceans,_ Daphne_, and mosquito larvae.4 _L. giganteum_, a parasite of mosquito larvae, has been approved by the Environmental Protection Agency for use in the United States for biological control of the adult mosquito population.4

Both _Pythium_ and _Lagenidium_ species belong to the kingdom stramenopila, phylum oomycota, and class oomycetes.10 The oomycetes, often referred to as water molds, have many characteristics in common with the fungi but are phylogenetically distinct.3 Oomycetes differ from true fungi in that they produce motile, flagellate zoospores, have a cell wall that does not contain chitin, and have different metabolic pathways and organelle structure. The lack of sterol components within the plasma membrane of oomycetes is clinically significant since ergosterol is the target molecule for the action of most antifungal drugs.3

_Pythium_ sp. and _Lagenidium_ sp. are believed to have life cycles that are similar to that of other oomycetes [see photos at URL at end of these comments]. When placed in water, oomycete hyphae develop sporangia which eventually form multiple biflagellate zoospores. The zoospores then break through the vesicle wall and swim away and encyst. These zoospores are thought to be the infectious stage and have been shown to display chemotactic behavior toward damaged animal and plant tissues. Oomycetes also have the ability to form resistant spores when ambient conditions do not favor zoospore formation.10

The diagnosis of oomycete infections can be difficult due to the clinical and histological similarity between the oomycetes themselves as well as the similarities between oomycotic and zygomycotic infections.4 Some cases of lagiendiosis have probably been misdiagnosed as pythiosis. Though misdiagnosis of lagenidosis as pythiosis does not have clinical repercussions, misdiagnosis of zygomycosis as oomycosis may lead to inappropriate treatment regimens as zygomycetes are true fungi. Although there are histological differences between _Lagenidium_ sp._, Pythium insidiosum_, and zygomycete organisms, they are not distinct enough for definitive diagnosis.4 A _P. insidiosum_-specific polyclonal antibody has been developed that does not stain _Lagenidium_ sp. hyphae. The effectiveness of this primary antibody in immunohistochemical staining is currently under investigation.4

Currently, the diagnostic test of choice is culture of infected tissue followed by morphologic and molecular identification of the pathogen. Small pieces of tissue are placed on PYG agar and incubated at 37 C. Growth should be apparent after 24 hours. Samples that must be shipped should arrive within 48 hours and should be packaged at ambient temperature (organisms may be impossible to culture if the tissue has been refrigerated or frozen). Bacterial contamination often prevents adequate growth of oomycetes. In such instances, antibiotic impregnated agar can prevent bacterial overgrowth.4 Even under the best of conditions, _Pythium_ sp. is very difficult to grow and even harder to identify because it requires sporulation and identification of the zoospores.

PCR assays are available to detect oomycete DNA sequences in nucleic acid extracted from agar cultures, blood, or tissue biopsies. This technique also can differentiate zygomycosis, pythiosis, and lagenidiosis.4

Two ELISA tests are available for detection of anti-_P. insidiosum_ antibodies in animals. Both of these tests are highly specific and sensitive.4 ELISA also may be useful in monitoring the response to treatment. Elimination of oomycete infection results in a serial decrease in antibody titer if treatment is successful.5

The treatment of choice for oomycosis has been aggressive surgical resection.3,10 Whenever possible, complete amputation of affected limbs may be curative.2 In cases of advanced gastrointestinal and disseminated disease, total surgical excision may be impossible. In advanced gastrointestinal disease, infection usually involves the extensive portions of the alimentary tract and mesentery. Furthermore, the recurrence rate after surgery also is very high if the affected area is not completely excised.3,10 Due to possible recurrence, it has been recommended that surgical excision be followed by systemic administration of antifungal drugs.10 However, antifungal therapy may not be effective because of the lack of ergosterol (the target molecule of antifungal drugs) in the plasma membranes of oomycetes. This probably explains why antifungal chemotherapy alone has shown very little success in treating oomycosis.5

Recently, immunotherapy using a newly formulated vaccine has been successful in treating cutaneous pythiosis in horses and dogs.5 This vaccine has been shown to be effective for both acute and chronic cutaneous pythiosis in the horse.5,10 In one report, a dog was cured of cutaneous disease with only 2 injections of this vaccine given 2 weeks apart.5

For most oomycotic infections, the prognosis is guarded to poor regardless of the advances in treatment. The reason is that many dogs have extensive gastrointestinal disease, and many horses have multiple bone lesions at the time of initial presentation.3,10 Disseminated disease and bone lesions are negative prognosticators in any species. The rate of recurrence after attempted surgical excision has also been a major factor in the failure of treatment.
