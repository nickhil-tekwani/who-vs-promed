New Zealand researchers have proven sheep can carry and potentially spread the parasite behind the bovine anaemia epidemic. Sheep were asymptomatic carriers of the tick-borne parasite _Theileria orientalis_, which meant they were unaffected by the disease but could spread it to the ticks feeding on them.

_T. orientalis_ is a tickborne intracellular parasite of red blood cells causing severe and mild infections in various ruminants worldwide. To date [22 Feb 2021], there have been 11 types identified within this species, of which 4 types are presently found in New Zealand cattle, researchers said.

Since 2012, New Zealand suffered a substantial epidemic of infectious bovine anaemia in both dairy and beef cattle associated with the Ikeda type. Researchers believed the speed at which the disease spread through the North Island suggested other species could have been involved in transmission.

Therefore, the aim of a series of related experiments was to test the null hypothesis sheep can't maintain _T. orientalis_ Ikeda-type infection or infect ticks feeding on them. Several studies were conducted over 2 years to address this hypothesis.

The studies showed sheep can have detectable levels of _T. orientalis_ Ikeda-type infection, in both the acute and chronic phase, and _Haemaphysalis longicornis_ (also known as the Asian longhorned tick) larvae can become infected when feeding on sheep. Researchers recorded no anaemia, weight loss, or clinical disease in the sheep in the acute phase of infection.

[Some North Island, as well as South Island, cattle are suffering anemia as the result of infection with a strain of the parasite _Theileria orientalis_, called Ikeda. The infection is spread by ticks.

"The intracellular protozoal parasite _Theileria orientalis_ ikeda has rapidly spread across southeastern Australia since 2006, causing deaths and production losses in cattle. The 3-host "bush tick" _Haemaphysalis longicornis_ (Neumann) appears the principal biological vector in the endemic regions. To generate sufficient numbers of ticks to produce stabilate for infection to confirm vector competency and for acaricide trials, the optimal conditions and stage-specific intervals for the generational lifecycle of _H. longicornis_ was defined on 2 dogs and 2 steers. To determine whether _H. longicornis_ was a definitive host for _T. orientalis_, nymphal stages were fed on a steer infected with _T. orientalis_ and moulted adults were permitted to feed for 3 days on an uninfected calf prior to harvest. Subsequent detection of infection after inoculation of 4 naive calves with stabilate produced from ground-up adult ticks or dissected salivary glands confirmed _H. longicornis_ as one final (definitive) host for _T. orientalis_ in Australia."

Now it seems we know this particular tick feeds on sheep with no ill effects to the sheep.

The issue first appeared in Northland in August 2012, and since then cases were found across the North Island but predominantly in the upper island. The bulk of cases appear in areas where ticks are very prevalent. It appears tick populations increased rapidly as a result of summer's drought [in 2013], and the mild winter might mean they survived and became active early during the 2014 season.

It now appears the sheep may be harboring the infective agent and passing it to the ticks. While this is great research, it is in some ways disheartening to realize the sheep may be the source of the situation. It seems keeping cattle and sheep treated with a tick control will be essential to the health of cattle. - Mod.TG
