Some background on viral gastroenteritis in the United States from GIDEON
<http://www.cynifo.com>
Norwalk agent [NA is named for an outbreak of gastroenteritis which
occurred in Norwalk, Ohio in 1972.
A viral etiology was suspected in 10 percent of all foodborne food-related
outbreaks of unknown cause during 1973 to 1987.

The estimated incidence of NA disease is 23 million cases/year. 9.2
million of these are food-borne (20 000 hospitalizations; 124 deaths),
accounting for 66.6% of all foodborne illness and 6.9% of food-related
deaths. Nine food-borne outbreaks of NA disease (1,233 cases, 0 fatal)
were reported during 1993 to 1997.
Waterborne outbreaks:
An outbreak of NA gastroenteritis (191 cases) was ascribed to contaminated
commercial ice in 1987.
A school outbreak of SRSV (small round-structured gastroenteritis virus =
calicivirus) infection (148 cases) in Wisconsin during 1995 was traced to
lake water
An outbreak (55 cases) of NA infection in Idaho during 1996 was ascribed to
lake water.
No outbreaks of Norwalk-like agent gastroenteritis were ascribed to
recreational water in 1997; 2 outbreaks in 1998 - 30 cases at a campground
in Ohio and 18 cases at a public beach in Wisconsin.
Salads:
An outbreak (1,440 cases) of Norwalk agent infection was ascribed to
celery/chicken salad in 1988.
An outbreak (191 cases) of Norwalk-like viral infection was associated with
potato salad served at a catered luncheon at a company in Anchorage Alaska
in 1999.
Norwalk-like-type virus in pre-prepared salads was implicated in a
multistate (333 cases, 11 hospitalized) of gastroenteritis among employees
of a automobile manufacturer in 2000.
Norwalk virus in salad was implicated in an outbreak (79 cases) at a hotel
in Denver, Colorado in 2000.
Shellfish:
Two outbreaks (40 cases and 180 cases) of SRSV infection was ascribed to
oysters in 1993.
An outbreak of SRSV infection involving 34 clusters in 1994 was also
ascribed to oysters; as was an outbreak of 3 cases in 1995.
179 confirmed cases of calicivirus gastroenteritis acquired from oysters
(_Crassostrea virginica_) were reported from Louisiana in 1996.
Person-to person:
An outbreak of 19 cases at a school dormitory in Madison, Wisconsinduring
1999 was ascribed to person-to-person transmission.
Vehicle not specified:
An outbreak of Norwalk-like agent gastroenteritis (594 cases) was reported
at an elementary school in Florida in 1996 - drinking water suspected but
not proven as source.
An outbreak of probable NA infection (450 reported; true number estimated
at 1806) occurred on an American aircraft carrier off the coast of Japan in
1997 - source unknown.
An outbreak of NA infection (99 cases) at a military facility in Texas was
reported in 1998 (soft drinks suspected as vehicle).
An outbreak (ca. 280 cases) of gastrointestinal illness in California in
1999 was ascribed to a 'Norwalk-like' virus.
Other viruses
An outbreak of Parkville virus (morphologically related to calicivirus)
infection was associated with a restaurant in Maryland in 1996.
An estimated 3.9 million cases of astrovirus infection (10 fatal) occur
each year - 39 000 of these food-borne, accounting for 0.3% of all
food-borne infection in this country.
At least 6 outbreaks of gastroenteritis had been ascribed to Snow Mountain
virus as of 1990.
