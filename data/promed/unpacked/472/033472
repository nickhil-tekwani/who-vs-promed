Rice plants in Punjab show signs of sheath blight
-------------------------------------------------
Agricultural experts are warning farmers in Punjab about the appearance of sheath blight in the on-going [2015] kharif [monsoon] rice crop (June-December). The current rainy season is conducive for spreading of the disease.

"Reports of sheath blight have been received from various parts of Punjab," the Department Head of Plant Pathology at the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) was quoted. He noted that they have observed initial symptoms of irregular greyish green lesions with purple margins on the lower leaf sheath just above the water level.

Both basmati and non-basmati rice crops are understood to be affected by the disease. State Agricultural Officers have advised farmers to spray their crops with fungicide to curb the spread of the disease. They also stressed the need for respraying the same fungicide after 15 days.

Punjab is one of the major rice growing states in India and accounts for about 11 per cent of the country's total rice production. In this [2015] kharif season, total paddy acreage in Punjab has reached about 2.8 million hectares [about 6.9 million acres].

[Sheath blight of rice is caused by the fungus _Thanatephorus cucumeris_ (previously _Rhizoctonia solani_), a ubiquitous soil borne fungus. Symptoms include lesions on the leaf sheath just above the soil or water level. Lesions expand upwards on the sheaths and spread to the leaves and then to neighbouring tillers and other plants. Under favourable conditions, infection spreads rapidly in the field. Yield losses of up to 50 per cent are reported due to poorly filled grain heads and reduced plant vigour.

Fungal sclerotia survive for long periods in the soil and float to the surface of flooded rice fields causing infection in the next crop. Some weed hosts can serve as pathogen reservoirs. No reliable source of genetic host resistance has been identified so far. Disease management includes cultural and phytosanitary techniques and foliar fungicides.

The possible emergence of strains with fungicide resistances (for example, see ProMED-mail post 20130905.1926343) is causing concern for rice producers worldwide. In India, the disease has become more prevalent in recent years on improved crop varieties.

_T. cucumeris_ is associated with "rhizoctonia" diseases such as damping-off, root rot, basal stem rot (foot rot), and fruit rot, in a large number of crops. Its wide host range includes cereals, pasture grasses, oilseed rape, and pulses, making it difficult to control by crop rotation.
