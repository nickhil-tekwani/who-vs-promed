An ongoing outbreak in Denmark belies the fact that salmonellosis
rates in Scandinavia have remained fairly constant during the past
decade. [The following background information has been abstracted
from GideonOnline. - Mod.LL]

Salmonellosis accounts for 5 percent of diarrhea episodes in children
below age 5 years (2005 publication).

Salmonellosis was the most common bacterial zoonosis in Denmark prior
to 1998; since that year, it has ranked 2nd (to campylobacteriosis).

During the past 25 years, _S._ Enteritidis infection has been more
common than _S._ Typhimurium infection.

Eggs accounted for over 50 percent of human salmonellosis cases in
1997; approximately 35 percent in 1998.

A total of 59 fatal cases of _S._ Typhimurium infection were reported
during 1995 to 1999.

Multiresistant strains of _S._ Typhimurium accounted for 25 percent
of isolates in 1999; 10 percent in 2000; 14 percent in 2001.
- During December 1996 to March 1999, 31 domestic animal herds were
found infected with multiresistant _S._ Typhimurium DT104.
- There is evidence for transmission of _S._ Typhimurium DT104 among
cattle and pig herds.

_Salmonella_ accounted for 38 percent of food-related outbreaks
reported during 1990 to 1992; 28 percent during 1993 to 1998.
- _S._ Enteritidis accounted for 13.3 percent of household disease
outbreaks during 1991 to 2001, and _S._ Typhimurium for 5.6 percent.

Notable outbreaks
-----------------
1993 - An outbreak (550 cases, approximate) of _S._ Infantis
infection was ascribed to pork.

ascribed to smoked pork loin. The expected incidence of this species
was 0 to 3 cases per year.
1998 - An outbreak (25 cases, 2 fatal) of multi-resistant _S._
Typhimurium DT104 infection was traced to fresh pork. A total of 2
infected herds were identified during the outbreak.
1999 - An outbreak (49 cases) of _S._ Paratyphi B infection was
reported among Danish tourists in Turkey.
2000 - An outbreak (9 cases, 1 fatal) of multi-resistant _S._
Typhimurium U302 infection was reported.
2001 - An outbreak (127 cases) of _S._ Bovismorbificans infection was
reported nationwide.
2001 - An outbreak (16 cases in Denmark) of _S._ Oranienburg due to
contaminated German chocolate affected several European countries.
2001 - An outbreak of _S._ Schwarzenground infections in Denmark and

2002 - An outbreak (81 cases) of multi-resistant _S._ Typhimurium
infection was ascribed to contaminated turkey.
2003 - An outbreak (112 cases) of _S._ Typhimurium DT108 infection
caused by kebab meat imported from Denmark was reported in Sweden.
2003 - An outbreak (67 confirmed, 390 estimated cases) of _S._
Typhimurium U302 infection was ascribed to fecal contamination of a
buffet at a restaurant in Copenhagen.
2005 - An outbreak (22 cases) of _S._ Typhimurum DT104 infection was
caused by raw beef carpacio imported from Italy.
2005 - An outbreak (178 cases) of _S._ Goldcoast infection in Majorca

Yersinia, Giardia and Blastocystis.
