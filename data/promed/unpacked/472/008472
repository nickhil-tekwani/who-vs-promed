EHD cases confirmed in Nebraska cattle
------------------
According to State Veterinarian Dr. Dennis Hughes, the Nebraska Department of Agriculture has confirmed 9 cases of Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease (EHD) in cattle throughout Nebraska.

According to Hughes, the disease has been affecting Nebraska's deer population since the 1970s and is transmitted from deer to cattle by biting insects called midges.

"This is an unfortunate disease that has no preventative measures or treatment options for affected cattle," said Dr. Hughes. "The extreme hot and dry conditions that have persisted across Nebraska have contributed to the number of cases we are experiencing. The 1st frost should eliminate the disease-spreading midges."

EHD signs in cattle include: fever, anorexia, reduced milk production, swollen eyes, redness and scaling of the nose and lips, nasal and eye discharge, ulcers on mouth, excessive salivation, lameness, swelling of the tongue, oral/nasal blisters, and labored breathing.

Producers with animals experiencing these signs are urged to contact their veterinarian immediately.

"Because these cases aren't confined to a particular area, we have been receiving many questions from both producers and veterinarians across the state," Hughes said.

"Therefore, we felt it necessary to share this basic disease information and urge producers to contact their local veterinarians if their animals are experiencing these signs."

[Epizootic hemorrhagic disease rarely affects cattle but it can.

The disease is transmitted by "no-see-ums" or biting midges. These insect transmit the disease to deer and occasionally to deer. Hence, a killing frost will help eliminate the disease.

The state veterinarian discussion does not mention by what method the disease was diagnosed.

Epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) is one of the most important diseases of deer in North America. The epizootic hemorrhagic disease viruses (EHDV) are widespread in white-tailed deer and periodically cause serious epidemics in wild populations.

Some of these viruses can also cause disease in cattle. In the USA, EHD in cattle is uncommon, rarely fatal, and usually associated with an epidemic in deer. However, an EHDV serogroup virus called the Ibaraki virus causes serious epidemics in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan that may have affected as many as 39 000 cattle. The disease caused by the Ibaraki virus is known as Ibaraki disease; some authorities consider it to be a synonym for epizootic hemorrhagic disease in cattle.

The epizootic hemorrhagic disease viruses belong to the genus _Orbivirus_, family _Reoviridae_. Ten serotypes of EHDV are known worldwide.

The Ibaraki virus is closely related to EHDV. According to some authors, it is a distinct virus belonging to the EHDV serogroup. According to others, the Ibaraki virus and the Australian (but not the American) EHDV serotype 2 are nearly identical topotypes. There is more than one strain of the Ibaraki virus.

The viruses of the EHDV serogroup are transmitted by biological vectors, usually biting midges in the genus _Culicoides_. In North America, _C. variipennis_ is the major vector. Some species of gnats and mosquitoes can also transmit EHDV.

Ibaraki disease in cattle is characterized by fever, anorexia, and difficulty swallowing. The swallowing disorders are caused by damage to the striated muscles of the pharynx, larynx, esophagus and tongue, and may lead to dehydration, emaciation, and aspiration pneumonia. Edema, hemorrhages, erosions, and ulcerations may be seen in the mouth, on the lips, and around the coronets. The animals may be stiff and lame, and the skin may be thickened and edematous. Abortions and stillbirths have also been reported in some epidemics. Some affected cattle die.

Outside Japan, Korea and Taiwan, most EHDV infections in cattle appear to be subclinical. Symptomatic infections resemble Ibaraki disease, but tend to be less severe. Typical signs include fever, oral ulcers, salivation, lameness associated with coronitis, and weight loss. In pregnant cows, the fetus may be resorbed or develop hydranencephaly if it is infected between 70 and 120 days of gestation. Deaths are uncommon with the North American strains of EHDV; however, some animals may be lame and unthrifty for a prolonged period. Epizootic hemorrhagic disease has not been reproduced in experimentally infected cattle; although animals become viremic, they remain asymptomatic.

With these clinical signs it would be surprising to learn this disease must be distinguished from foot and mouth disease.

More information on the type of diagnostic testing used to identify this disease and if the testing/investigation protocol involved distinguishing this disease from FMD would be greatly appreciated.
