The Guam Department of Public Health and Social Services reports 2 separate
incidents of O1 _Vibrio cholerae_ importation on Guam.
Incident 1: On Sunday, 25 Jun 2000, a 44 year-old male Pohnpei resident
businessman flew to Guam with his family and registered at a Tumon Bay
hotel. On the morning of 28 Jun 2000 he developed severe diarrhea and
vomiting and that evening he was transported to the Guam Memorial Hospital
Emergency Department (GMH-ED) by ambulance. He was given IV fluids and,
after collecting a stool sample, an antibiotic (ciprofloxin). The patient
was discharged without hospitalization. Two days later the GMH laboratory
reported isolating O1 _V. cholerae_ from the patient's stool specimen and
the patient was recalled to the GMH-ER for consultation. Although still
weak, the patient reported he felt much improved and that no other family
members had become ill. The patient recalled that during the last minute
rush to prepare for his trip to Guam he had eaten at a fast food snack-bar
on Pohnpei. The patient isolate has been confirmed by the Guam Public
Health Laboratory (GPHL) as O1 _V. cholerae_ Ogawa.
Incident 2: On Sunday, 25 June 2000, a 24 year-old Chuukese resident of
Guam purchased "reef" fish from a local market that specializes in
importing fish from Pohnpei. She barbecued and ate the fish that evening.
The next morning she began having watery diarrhea but opted for
self-medication. On Wednesday she began vomiting as well but continued to
self-medicate. On Jul 1 [2000 she was transported to the GMH-ED by
ambulance and hospitalized, primarily because she was 3 months pregnant.
The GMH Laboratory reported isolation of O1 _V. cholerae_ and the isolate
has been confirmed by the GPHL as O1 _V. cholerae_ Ogawa. The patient was
the only member of her family to eat the fish she had prepared, and no
leftovers were available for laboratory examination; other family members,
including a 2Â½ year-old daughter, have remained well.
Two other possible cholera cases are currently being investigated, one
purchased fish at the same store as the second case.

[Visiting Pohnpei & consumption of fresh fish from there may be hazardous
to your health at this time. Anyone experiencing severe watery diarrhea in
those contexts should seek medical advice immediately. - Mod.JW
