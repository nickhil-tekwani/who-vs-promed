South Korea's Health Ministry said on Thursday [11 Jan 2007] that a
poultry worker was infected with bird flu late in 2006, but had not
been seriously ill. The person was infected after an outbreak of the
H5N1 strain that first hit poultry farms in the country in November
[2006]. "We confirmed the person was positive for antibodies to bird
flu," the Ministry said in a statement. The poultry worker was
subject to regular testing of farmers and workers involved in a mass
cull of about 1.7 million fowl following the discovery of the deadly
virus. The worker did not develop any serious illness and is now healthy.

During an H5N1 outbreak in late 2003 and early 2004, several South
Koreans were infected but none developed any major illnesses, South
Korean health officials said.

South Korea's disease control agency stated on Thursday [11 Jan 2007]
that it has confirmed a human infection with avian influenza virus.

The state-run Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC),
which conducted tests among 26 residents near four farms in the
southwestern region hit by bird flu in November and December in
[2006] said it has discovered a person who tested positive for the
highly pathogenic H5N1 virus. The person was reportedly working at
one of the farms at that time.

South Korean officials said on Thu 11 Jan 2007 that the bird flu
virus had been transmitted to a human during a recent outbreak among
poultry, but the person showed no symptoms of disease. The South's
Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said a poultry farm
worker, whom it didn't identify, had been infected with the deadly
H5N1 strain of the virus but developed natural immunity to the
disease and wasn't ill.

The worker took the anti-flu drug Tamiflu following the outbreak,
which "highly likely" prevented the person from getting sick, center
official Kwon Joon-wook said. The person "is neither a patient nor
currently carries the virus," Kwon said, assuring there was no risk
of spreading the virus to other humans.

The outbreak late in 2006 in Gimje, 257 kilometers (160 miles) south
of Seoul, led to the slaughter of thousands of poultry; see

and

It was not the first time the bird flu virus had been transmitted to
humans in South Korea. In 2006, South Korea announced 9 people had
been infected with the virus during earlier outbreaks between late
2003 and early 2004. None of them developed the disease and all have
remained healthy.

[Asymptomatic human cases of avian influenza H5N1 virus infection,
accompanying outbreaks of disease in poultry, have been recorded
previously in South Korea (see: Avian influenza, human (146): South
Korea, asymptomatic 20060916.2633). Infection of poultry workers and
poultry cullers, however, has been rare to non-existent elsewhere in
Asia. To what extent this is due to virus strain difference or the
extensive use of the anti-viral Tamiflu in South Korea is unknown at
present. Poultry workers exposed to H7N7 avian influenza virus in an
outbreak in the Netherlands, however. did develop minor symptoms
despite the availability of antineuraminidase.

The virus responsible for the outbreaks in South Korea (and also
Japan) belongs to the V genotype of H5N1 avian influenza virus,
whereas the predominant virus in East Asia belongs to the Z genotype.
These genotypes are reassortants which differ in the origin of their
NA genome subunit. This may be a determining factor in the apparent
lack of virulence of the South Korean virus. - Mod.CP]
