Alert: Rust now on soybeans in 3 states; AL, GA and FL
-----------------------------------------------
USDA is now reporting the following on its National Map Commentary:
"3 counties have now reported soybean rust on soybeans. They are
Baldwin County in Alabama (29 Jun 2005), Marion County in Florida (29
Jun) and Seminole County in Georgia. The Alabama and Florida finds
were in sentinel sites, while the Georgia find was on volunteer
soybeans, which have since been destroyed. 6 counties in Florida have
now reported soybean rust on kudzu. The latest find is in Leon County
in northern Florida."

USDA is reporting Asian soybean rust was found on soybeans in a
sentinel plot in Marion County, FL, yesterday -- the 2nd incidence of
rust on U.S. soybeans in 2005. The other was rust in Seminole County,
GA., on volunteer soybeans, which have since been destroyed to the
extent possible. 6 counties in Florida, including Marion, have
soybean rust on kudzu.

This information is according to the National Map Commentary updated:
30 Jun 2005 on the USDA site. The Florida state commentary on the
site from 29 Jun states: "The soybean sentinel plot in Marion County
was confirmed positive for soybean rust on 29 Jun. This is the 1st
incidence of rust on soybean in Florida for 2005."

Also on the USDA site today, one Alabama county -- Baldwin, which
juts down in the southwest corner of the state -- is marked red
(confirmed rust), with this commentary from yesterday: "Leaf samples
were collected from soybean sentinel plots in Baldwin and Escambia
counties in SW Alabama for laboratory analysis."

No further updates are available.

[The most significant point of this piece is that Asian soybean rust
(ASR) is being reported on sentinel soybean plants and that 3 states
are affected, Alabama, Florida, and Georgia. More reports of ASR are
likely to follow. - Mod.DH]
