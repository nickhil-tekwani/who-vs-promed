United Nations agencies are helping health authorities in Haiti carry
out an emergency vaccination campaign after an outbreak of diphtheria
in the capital, Port-au-Prince, a spokesperson with the world body
said today [18 May 2010].

Cases of the disease were first reported on Saturday [15 May 2010] in
Camp Batimat in Cite Soleil district, one of the settlements housing
people displaced by the January [2010] earthquake, Christiane
Berthiaume, spokesperson for the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), told
reporters in Geneva.

The UN World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF are supporting the
vaccination campaign led by Haiti's health ministry. About 2000
people thought to have been exposed to the diphtheria bacterium are
being specifically targeted in the vaccination campaign, carried out
by more than 80 vaccinators.

Diphtheria is an infectious disease that spreads from person to
person through respiratory droplets from the throat through coughing
and sneezing. The illness usually affects the tonsils, pharynx,
larynx, and occasionally the skin. Symptoms range from a moderately
sore throat to toxic life-threatening diphtheria of the larynx or of
the lower and upper respiratory tracts.

Since February [2010], an estimated 888 000 people living in
displaced persons camps in Haiti have been vaccinated in the ongoing
campaign against diphtheria, including more than 220 000 children
under the age of 8.

A 2nd phase of the campaign will start in June [2010] and will target
people living outside the camps.

Meanwhile, Edmond Mulet, the Special Representative of the Secretary
General for Haiti, on Monday [17 May 2010] visited camp "Tepis Vert"
in Cite Soleil district to assess the living conditions and the needs
of the 7000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) there.

"We are here to better understand you, listen to you, and try to
solve the problems," Mr Mulet told inhabitants of the camp, who have
been suffering from inadequate basic services, including lack of
sanitation facilities. The camp is also prone to flooding.

[Diphtheria is endemic in Haiti. Of note, the last case in the USA
occurred in an elderly traveler returning from Haiti in 2003 (see
<http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2010/chapter-2/diphtheria.aspx>).
In October 2009, ProMED-mail posted a report of an outbreak in Haiti
of 11 cases of diphtheria, including 5 deaths, in 3 departments in 4
weeks (see ProMED-mail post Diphtheria - Haiti: RFI 20091030.3755).
The WHO standard for a national epidemic is that 3 departments in the
country are affected within 3 months. Because of the high case
fatality rate at the time, it was assumed that many cases were unreported.

The news release above does not state the number of cases or the case
fatality rate in the present outbreak in Port-au-Prince in Camp
Batimat in Cite Soleil district, one of the settlements housing
people displaced by the January 2010 earthquake. According to the
news release, a mass vaccination program against diphtheria in
displaced persons camps has been ongoing since February 2010.

All foreign workers with local populations in Haiti should be
up-to-date with diphtheria toxoid vaccine before departure (see
(<http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2010/chapter-2/diphtheria.aspx>).
Diphtheria toxoid is not manufactured as a monovalent vaccine but is
available in pediatric (D) and adult formulations (d) that are
combined with other vaccines such as tetanus toxoid (DT, Td), or
tetanus toxoid and acellular or whole-cell pertussis antigens (DTaP,
DTwP, Tdap). Adults 19-64 years of age should receive a single dose
of Tdap to replace a single dose of Td for active booster
immunization against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis. Thereafter,
routine booster doses with Td should be given every 10 years to
maintain seroprotection against diphtheria as well as tetanus. Adults
older than 65 years of age should receive Td; Tdap is not licensed
for this age group.
