Pig farmers told to maintain good hygiene
-----------------------------------------
The Agriculture, Fisheries & Conservation Department has urged pig farmers
to maintain good hygiene, following a foot and mouth disease [FMD] outbreak
in a Yuen Long pig farm. No abnormal mortality in local pigs has been
observed so far.
Department officers inspected the farm in Lau Fau Shan on 10 Jan 2007 after
receiving a report on a suspected outbreak. Tissue samples collected from
sick sows tested positive for the FMD virus. The farmer was ordered to
disinfect the whole farm and control movement of pigs and workers.
The department refuted an allegation that its refusal to allow the farm to
segregate infected pigs led to the outbreak. The farm was not restricted
from moving healthy pigs to any licensed structures. For the 2 sick sows
suspected to have been infected, the inspectors advised they not be moved
as they might infect the healthy stock.
FMD is a common viral disease occurring in pigs in the region. It usually
strikes the pig population sporadically in winter. Farmers can control the
disease by vaccination and good biosecurity. They should comply with
vaccination protocol, step up precautions and report any suspected cases to
the department.

that FMDV serotypes O and Asia 1 are circulating in China. - Mod.AS]
