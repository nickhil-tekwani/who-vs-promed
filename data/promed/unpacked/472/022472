[While the dates of onset of illness are not available in the confirmation reports, it appears as though transmission is ongoing in Buraidah, both in the healthcare environment as well as in the camel population, as newly reported cases have histories of exposure in the healthcare environment or to camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness. The total number of confirmed cases in Buraidah is now at 34 including 17 deaths (reported case fatality rate 50 percent).
