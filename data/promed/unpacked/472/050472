Ref: Sammons JS: Ready or Not: Responding to Measles in the Postelimination Era. Ann Intern Med. 2014 Apr 24. doi: 10.7326/M14-0892. [Epub ahead of print]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Although endemic measles was eliminated in the United States in 2000 (1), 2 concurrent measles outbreaks at opposite ends of the country offer a sobering reminder of the threat of this global disease. As more parents decline to vaccinate their children, measles incidence is increasing -- a fact that alarms me both as a hospital epidemiologist and as a parent of a vulnerable infant too young to receive the measles vaccine. Because infected patients are likely to seek medical care, hospitals and clinics may inadvertently fuel transmission if those with measles are not rapidly triaged and isolated. Yet, because of the success of the measles vaccine, many clinicians have never seen measles and may not be able to recognize its features. It is crucial that providers become familiar with this deadly disease and apply the necessary control measures to contain it.

An estimated 20 million cases of measles occur each year worldwide (2). In the prevaccine era, approximately 500 000 measles cases occurred in the United States annually, with 500 deaths and 48 000 hospitalizations (1). After elimination, the median annual number of cases decreased to 60, but this number is steadily increasing. Since 2010, there has been an average of 155 cases per year (2-3). In 2014, 106 measles cases have been reported in the 1st 3 months alone (3).

High vaccination coverage is essential to prevent spread after importation. However, coverage with measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine varies by state. The recent outbreaks in New York City and Orange County, California, remind us how quickly imported cases of measles can spread in communities with large numbers of unvaccinated persons. Although vaccination coverage among children aged 19 to 35 months continues to be near or above 90 percent nationwide, 15 states had MMR vaccination rates below 90 percent according to the National Immunization Survey (4). States allowing philosophical exemptions from vaccination have significantly higher rates of unvaccinated children (5). In addition, unvaccinated children are likely to cluster geographically, thus increasing the risk for outbreaks after importation (5). In fact, most postelimination measles cases have been due to outbreaks. In 2013, 75 percent of cases in the 1st 8 months of the year were due to 8 outbreaks (2). Most occurred in unvaccinated persons (82 percent) or those with unknown vaccination status (9 percent) (2). As expected, 99 percent of cases could be linked to an imported case that led to a community-based outbreak. Of the imported measles cases, 50 percent were from Europe (2).

Measles is one of the most contagious infectious diseases known, with secondary attack rates greater than 90 percent in susceptible contacts (6). Transmission occurs primarily through direct contact with infectious droplets; however, measles virus can survive for up to 2 hours in fine particle aerosols and be transmitted via inhalation of small droplets even without face-to-face contact (6). The incubation period ranges from 7 to 21 days but is generally 8 to 12 days from exposure to symptom onset. Persons with measles are contagious from 4 days before to 4 days after appearance of rash, underscoring the importance of early recognition for returned travelers with relevant symptoms even before the rash appears (7).

It is essential that providers maintain a high level of suspicion for measles in those with febrile rash illness who have recently traveled or have had contact with travelers and are able to recognize its clinical features (8). Measles is characterized by a prodrome of fever (up to 40.6 deg C [105 deg F]), cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis. A characteristic red, blotchy, "morbilliform" rash appears 2 to 4 days after symptom onset (Figure 1); it typically begins on the face before spreading downward and becoming confluent (8). Pathognomonic Koplik spots appear [on the mucous membrane of the cheeks and lips] 1 to 2 days before the rash and last 2 to 3 days; they are small, slightly raised, bluish-white spots on an erythematous base and have been reported in 60 percent to 70 percent of patients with measles, although they are probably present in all cases (Figure 2) (7, 9). Measles rash may be confused with other viral exanthems (erythema infectiosum [5th disease] or roseola), Kawasaki disease, or scarlet fever. Immunocompromised patients may not develop a characteristic rash (7). Complications are common in young children and include diarrhea, otitis media, bronchopneumonia, and croup; acute encephalitis occurs in 1 per 1000 cases and can lead to permanent brain damage. Death occurs in 1 to 3 per 1000 reported cases and is most common in young children or immunocompromised patients (1).

For suspected cases of measles, early reporting and rapid control efforts are vital to prevent spread in health care facilities. Providers should encourage patients and their parents to call before coming into medical offices or emergency departments so that appropriate precautions can be taken. Prompt consultation with the facility's infection control department is advisable, not only to provide real-time advice on appropriate control measures but also to assist with contact tracing and exposure management if needed. Laboratory confirmation should be sought through serologic testing or isolation of measles virus or identification of measles RNA from a clinical specimen (7). All cases should be reported promptly to the local health department.

If measles is suspected, airborne precautions should be implemented immediately (8). Such precautions include appropriate patient isolation and the use of personal protective equipment. Patients with suspected measles should be isolated in a negative air pressure isolation room, or airborne infection isolation room. These rooms are equipped with special air handling and ventilation systems that contain and safely remove infectious particles (10). Once the patient is appropriately isolated, providers should wear respiratory protection according to their facility's policies. Because current guidelines do not include specific guidance on respiratory protection (surgical mask vs. particulate respirator) (10), individual facilities' practices may vary. If an airborne infection isolation room is unavailable, the patient should be placed in a private room with the door closed (10). A surgical mask can be worn by the patient to limit spread. If an examination room is not immediately available and the patient must remain in a waiting room, use of a surgical mask and distancing the patient from others may reduce the potential for exposures (10). Airborne precautions should be continued for 4 days after rash onset in healthy persons or for the duration of illness in immunocompromised patients; for those not requiring hospitalization, voluntary quarantine is advised.

As measles incidence increases, clinicians have a vital role to play. We need to talk to our patients about measles vaccination and remind them what is at stake if imported measles cases continue to land in communities of unvaccinated persons, especially for those who are too young or ineligible to be vaccinated. Meanwhile, we must ensure that our facilities do not become centers for secondary measles transmission -- prompt recognition of suspected cases and rapid implementation of control measures are critical to prevent further spread.

Officials from the Prairie North Health Region west of Saskatoon [Saskatchewan] are advising people to be on alert for the symptoms of measles after identifying one confirmed and 3 probable cases, mostly in Lloydminster.

All the cases involve children under the of 16, who were not immunized against the disease.

On [Wed 30 Apr 2014], officials provided a list of locations associated with the current cases, as a way to notify members of the public who may have been exposed.

According to the health region, members of the public who visited the following establishments during the dates and times identified "should be aware of the symptoms of measles which include high fever, cough and runny nose, followed by a rash":

- St Walburg School (17 Apr 2014, all day).
- St Walburg Roman Catholic Church of the Assumption (20 Apr 2014, 11 am to 3 pm).
- Tim Hortons, Highway 17 South, 3902 -- 50 Avenue, Lloydminster (23 Apr 2014, 10:30 am to 1:30 pm).
- Real Canadian Superstore, 5031 -- 44 Street, Lloydminster (23 Apr 2014, 11 am to 1:30 pm).
- Safeway, 5211 - 44 Street, Lloydminster (23 Apr 2014, 2 pm to 5 pm).
- Giant Tiger, 4719 - 50 Avenue, Lloydminster (23 Apr 2014, 3 pm to 5:30 pm).
- Boston Pizza, 6303 - 44 Street, Lloydminster (21 Apr 2014, 11:30 am to 3 pm).
- Mark's Work Wearhouse, 4213 - 70 Avenue, Lloydminster (21 Apr 2014, 1 pm to 3:30 pm).
- WalMart, Highway 16 & 70 Avenue, Lloydminster (21 Apr 2014, 2 pm to 5 pm).
- McDonalds Restaurant, south side, Lloydminster (21 Apr 2014, 4 pm to 8 pm).

The region notes that anyone who develops symptoms of measles is asked to call a health provider's office and inform them of the situation to see how a visit to the office can be arranged so as to minimize contact with other patients.

People with severe symptoms should get immediate medical attention, and call ahead to avoid transmission of measles to others.

Dr Brenda Cholin, the region's Medical Health Officer, added that public health officials are also identifying and contacting individuals who may have been exposed to the measles virus during the contagious period. "These people are being given information about measles and what to do if they develop symptoms," Cholin said in a statement. The earliest a person will experience symptoms is one week following exposure.

The region notes that people born before 1970 are usually assumed to be immune from contracting the measles.

Measles is a highly infectious and potentially serious disease that is easily transmitted through the air.

More people have been infected with measles in the United States during the 1st 4 months of this year [2014] than have been infected in the 1st 4 months of the past 18 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Data released [Thu 24 Apr 2014] reveal a dramatic rise in measles outbreaks. Health officials say 13 outbreaks and 129 cases have been recorded this year [2014], according to the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.

California is reporting the highest numbers, with 58 cases from [1 Jan to 14 Apr 2014]. That's the most cases of measles in the state since 1995. In the past 13 years, the average number of measles cases was 9 per year. The CDC says many of the California cases are a result of people visiting the Philippines, which is experiencing a very large measles outbreak; at least 20 000 confirmed and suspected cases have been reported in the Asian nation. Visitors may pick up the disease and bring it back to the US, potentially infecting those who cannot be vaccinated against the measles because they are too young, for example, or who have intentionally remained unvaccinated.

Another problem that may be contributing to the increase in cases is a lack of awareness among doctors. "Because of the success of the measles vaccine, many clinicians have never seen measles and may not be able to recognize its features," Dr Julia Sammons writes in a commentary published [24 Apr 2014] in Annals of Internal Medicine.

Measles is one of the most contagious infectious diseases. Symptoms usually include fever, cough, and conjunctivitis, along with a rash. In rare cases, measles can lead to pneumonia and brain infections, which can be fatal.

The last time there was a reported death from measles in the US was in 2005, says Dr Anne Schuchat, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. Schuchat credits the CDC's Vaccines for Children program with contributing to high immunization rates and the dramatic decrease of measles in the US.

In the US, half of all children under 19 are eligible for the program, which provides vaccines to children whose parents or caregivers can't afford them. According to the CDC, vaccinations have proved to be very successful in the US, preventing an estimated 323 million illnesses and 732 000 deaths. Schuchat says it's impossible to predict what the coming months will bring, but she thinks more people could die from measles. "Unfortunately, it's probably just a matter a time."

The CDC recommends that children get 2 doses of the measles vaccine beginning at 12 months, with the 2nd dose between the ages of 4 and 6 years old. Infants 6 to 11 months old should get the vaccine before international travel.

Schuchat says it's absolutely crucial for measles vaccinations to be up to date.

To further reduce the spread of measles, the CDC also recommends that all US residents born after 1956 ensure that they are still immune to measles or receive a new MMR vaccination, particularly if they expect to travel outside North or South America.

A local doctor who specializes in infectious diseases says more than 120 cases of measles have been reported in the United States so far this year [2014], including 3 in southwestern Connecticut.

The most obvious symptom of measles is the red rash that starts on the face. Doctors say that comes with a high fever that can spike to 105 deg F [40.6 deg C].

State Health Department Spokesman Bill Gerrish says it's an adult from New Haven County who was diagnosed most recently. Doctors say this is a reminder to check on the vaccination status of yourself and others in your family.

Doctors say fortunately, the cases in Connecticut have been isolated [meaning in this context geographically separated, not self-quarantined], so there's no indication of an outbreak.

Bridgeport Hospital's Dr Zane Saul says the highly contagious respiratory virus is most dangerous for babies, and can cause miscarriages in pregnant women.

[8] USA (Ohio): Amish Community

http://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/amish-seek-measles-shots-after-ohio-outbreak-sickens-15-n89221


Members of an Ohio Amish community normally reluctant to vaccinate their children flocked to a makeshift clinic for measles shots this week after an outbreak that may have sickened at least 15 people. More than 135 people crowded into a local woodworking business Thursday [24 Apr 2014] where nurses used up every available dose of vaccine -- and then ordered 300 doses more, said Pam Palm, a spokeswoman for the Knox County, Ohio, Health Department.

"Not getting immunizations has been the way the Amish have felt in the past, but they certainly have responded in this situation," Palm said.

The outbreak was detected this week [week of 21 Apr 2014] when 4 unvaccinated Amish community members showed evidence of measles infection following a March [2014] trip to the Philippines to offer humanitarian aid to typhoon victims. More than 20 000 people have caught measles in the Philippines and at least 50 have died in a severe ongoing outbreak.

"They certainly have responded in this situation." Those 4 travelers likely infected at least 11 others aged 2 to 48, Palm said, adding that tests are still pending. Amish religious doctrine doesn't prohibit vaccination, but many families object to immunization and rates are far lower than in the general population, according to a 2011 study.

They were part of groups convened by Christian Aid Ministries, an Amish-Mennonite organization based in Berlin, Ohio. David Leid, a project coordinator, said that the group had planned to send at least 2 dozen more groups to the Philippines in coming months, but that the measles outbreak may have changed that. Volunteers are encouraged, but not required, to be vaccinated, Leid said. "We can't stop people from going to another country."

Health officials have asked unvaccinated people who traveled to the Philippines to isolate themselves for 21 days, a self-quarantine to prevent any measles cases that may develop from spreading. That request would apply to any future groups who travel to and from the country while the outbreak continues, Palm said. She acknowledged that local, state and federal health officials have no authority to prevent unvaccinated people from traveling to disease-prone areas.

Palm said the sight of so many community members with high fevers and rashes may have influenced the decision to seek measles shots. Measles is highly contagious and can cause serious illness and in rare cases, death.

The US is experiencing a surge of measles this year [2014] fueled in large part by unvaccinated travelers, mostly to the Philippines, officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. At least 129 cases have been confirmed in 13 states, the highest number reported during this period since 1996.

State health officials have confirmed a case of measles in a 19-month-old Hennepin County child, prompting them to notify other Twin Cities [Minneapolis-Saint Paul] families that they could be at risk amid an unusual measles outbreak that is crisscrossing the country. The case is the 1st in Minnesota so far this year [2014].

Nationally, 129 cases and 13 outbreaks have been reported by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the 1st 4 months of 2014 -- the highest in that period for the past 18 years.

The Minnesota Department of Health has alerted health care providers about the case and is working with Hennepin County to notify people who might have been exposed, according to Kris Ehresmann, the department's infectious disease director. The health agencies are also offering immune globulin with antibodies against the measles virus to anyone who might have been exposed. Ehresmann said any cases to result from the Hennepin County child are likely to emerge between now and [12 May 2014].

Measles, which has nearly been eliminated in the United States, produces a telltale blotchy red rash, along with cold-like symptoms including fever, runny nose, cough, and watery eyes. People infected with measles are contagious during the four days before they develop a rash and 4 days after. The virus is highly contagious and spreads through inhaling particles from the sneeze, cough or breath of an infected person -- even up to 2 hours after they have left the room.

Ehresmann said the baby caught measles when traveling internationally, so "thankfully" there weren't many exposures in Minnesota.

The CDC declared measles eliminated from the United States in 2000, but it's still prevalent around the world. The Philippines is undergoing a measles outbreak with more than 20 000 cases.

"It's important for people to remember that with the exception of the smallpox virus, these diseases have not been eradicated," Ehresmann said. "They really are just a plane ride away."

The CDC recommends that children receive a 1st dose of measles vaccine when they're 12 to 15 months old and a 2nd dose before starting kindergarten.

The Hennepin County child had received the 1st dose of the measles vaccine. But Ehresmann said the 1st dose doesn't always prevent the disease.

Adults born after 1956 should get at least one dose and 2 if they are at risk as college students, health care workers, international travelers, or women who could become pregnant. Before 1957, measles was so widespread that anyone born before then has natural immunity to the virus.

Hennepin County had a measles outbreak in 2011, when a 1-year-old caught the disease while traveling and then infected 20 people. 7 of the patients were too young to get the vaccine and 7 weren't vaccinated because their parents were concerned about the safety of the vaccine.

As the most deadly rash or fever illness children can catch, measles is best prevented by getting vaccinated, the CDC recommends. The vaccine has been in use since 1963. If families suspect their child has measles, Ehresmann said, they should call the hospital before they go in so health care providers can take precautions to prevent the spread of the virus.

Governor Cuomo is alerting New Yorkers about the importance of the measles vaccine due to the number of outbreaks in the beginning of 2014. According to the CDC, measles has infected 129 people in the United States in 2014 and 29 of those cases were in New York. They say that measles is very contagious and symptoms appear 10 to 12 days after exposure. The CDC says that symptoms appear in 2 stages, with symptoms such as runny nose, cough and a slight to high fever in the 1st stage. The 2nd stage consists of a red blotchy rash that spreads throughout the body. Individuals are not at-risk for contracting measles if they are immune or they have received the 2 doses of the MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] vaccine or were born before 1 Jan 1957.

Governor Cuomo said, "While many New Yorkers have likely already received measles vaccinations, with the number of outbreaks at a higher level in years the State is taking the opportunity to urge New Yorkers check with their healthcare provider to make sure they and all of their family members' immunizations are up-to-date." The CDC says the best way to prevent measles is to get vaccinated.

[12] Viet Nam (Ho Chi Minh City): no deaths reported

Ho Chi Minh City is suffering from a measles outbreak when about 1470 people have caught the disease so far this year [2014], local health authorities announced [Thu 24 Apr 2014].

This is 4 times as much as the figure of the whole year 2013, the city Department of Health said during a meeting organized to discuss measures to cope with the contagion.

From the beginning of the year [2014], measles has affected 1471 people, most of them children, while only about 400 measles cases were recorded in the entire year 2013, Dr. Nguyen Huu Hung, deputy director of the department, said at the event.

Measles has now spread to all 24 districts of the city, Dr Hung said, adding that there have been no reports on deaths associated with measles and its complications in the year to date [24 Apr 2014].

It is worth noting that more and more children who are not required to get vaccination against measles have contracted it, according to the department's statistics.

Last year [2013], children under 3 years old accounted for 90 percent of the total measles cases, the department said. This rate is only 70 percent this year [2014] while the number of children under 10 makes up about 90 percent of the patients. Therefore, the department has recommended that parents should have their kids, aged above 3, vaccinated against measles.

It had earlier suggested that kids of 9 months old to 3 years old should have the vaccination.

Dr Hung said that his agency has provided vaccination against measles to all children from 9 months old to 3 years old citywide, who have yet to be given any injection or just received the 1st of 2 recommended shots.

In addition, city health officials have also extended their vaccination program to children aged 4 to 6, who have been given one or no vaccine shot so far.

Amidst worries over widespread measles, city residents have hurriedly taken their kids to the municipal Pasteur Institute and the local Preventive Health Center for vaccination against the disease over the past several days.

Both children and adults have contracted measles, health authorities said. The HCMC Tropical Diseases Hospital has reported that adults occupy 33 percent (345 people) of the 1031 in-patients treated for measles at the infirmary so far this year [2014].

Nationwide, about 3570 measles cases were found in 61 out of the country's total of 63 cities and provinces as of [23 Apr 2014], the
health ministry said.

Yesterday [24 Apr 2014], 3 more children died of measles, taking its death toll to 131, the ministry announced.

This isn't the season for measles yet 40 cases in the city have flummoxed doctors. Nearly 70 percent of the afflicted are children below 14 years. "Measles usually occurs in winter, not summer. But we are attending to such cases now," say doctors. Though reasons for the outbreak are yet to be traced, doctors attribute it to irregular vaccination.

"This is true of the migrant population, specially the labour class. If one child in the group who is not immunized gets the virus, the disease can spread to other children," say doctors.

"The measles virus spreads very fast through aerosol and parents of the affected children must quarantine them. This is the season of summer camps and there are possibilities of affected children in their initial stages spreading the same to others," says pediatrician Karthik Nagesh.

Not surprisingly, the state health department is yet to gear up to control the outbreak. "Those who have missed the routine immunization are the affected group. We will be conducting field visits and focus on slums where children might have missed the routine immunization programme to prevent measles," said Dr Geetha Nyamegowda, director, health and family welfare department.

According to pediatrician Dr Jagadish Chinnappa, the outbreak is an indication of immunity level declining among children. "What was largely seen among toddlers is now seen among children aged 6-7 years. In over a month, I have seen 4 cases of measles among children," he adds.

Byappanahalli [Karnataka], the epicentre: the state health and family welfare department mapping the affected geographical area was shocked to find the large spread of the virus in Byappanahalli, Bangalore East, which is home to thousands of migrant families working in construction sites.

An apartment complex in Indiranagar [neighborhood] had multiple cases of measles that affected both adults and children.

"We don't know the source of infection. My husband and other neighbours in the apartment complex were down with measles. We could avoid the spread by quarantining them," said an apartment dweller on condition of anonymity.

The possible reason for the spike in measles cases is that children of migrant labourers who probably missed the vaccination got the virus and spread it.

"The outbreak has also been seen in North and central part of Karnataka. When we see more than 5 cases in one week in a taluk [administrative division], we term it as an outbreak. There could be unreported cases where the affected children are taken to temples, traditional healers and not to the hospital. Superstition and negligence are the biggest hurdles in measles elimination drive," said Dr BP Subramanya, surveillance medical officer World Health Organization, who is working with state government in measles elimination. He insists government conduct immunization programmes in construction sites to ensure labourers' children do not miss it.

The city has also seen a spike in cases of mumps. "I have seen about 4 cases in the past one week. Most of the kids are in the age group of 5-7 weeks or in pre-school. The 1st vaccine of mumps is given when baby attains 15 months. The 2nd vaccination is given when the baby is 4-5 years old. Many educated parents miss out on the 2nd vaccination due to lack of awareness," said Dr PS Raghavan pediatrician from Apollo Hospital.

[14] Ireland (Galway)
Date: Thu 1 May 2014

The HSE [Health Service Executive] West is urging all 3rd level students to ensure they are fully protected against measles. The warning comes in the wake of 15 cases being identified in Galway, Mayo, and Kerry in the past 6 weeks.

These are linked to an outbreak of this highly contagious infection among students or their contacts attending NUI [National University of Ireland] Galway at the end of March [2014]. A spokesperson for the local health authority says those affected by the virus are aged 14 to 33 years. The average age is 20. 10 cases were confirmed through laboratory tests, according to a statement from the HSE. The majority of the cases -- for which doctors could establish vaccination status -- were unvaccinated.

"Vaccination status was reported on 12 of the 15 cases, 8 were unvaccinated. 4 cases reported either one or 2 doses of MMR vaccine but for only one of the individuals who reported 2 doses of MMR were records available to confirm vaccination."

The HSE West's department of public health is appealing to students attending higher education colleges in the city to ensure they have received 2 doses of MMR vaccine to protect themselves, their contacts and the wider community against measles. One dose is not enough because it protects only about 95 per cent of individuals. "Due to the expected interaction between NUI Galway students with other university/college students in the western region and across the country, the HSE would like to remind all 3rd level university students in Ireland that they too should ensure that they are fully protected against measles and have received 2 doses of MMR vaccine. Most Irish students would have received 2 doses as part of the national immunisation programme either from their GP or the HSE services. "If they do not have any record of MMR vaccination they should contact their GP or student health service and obtain vaccination as soon as possible.

"Parents of all children should use this opportunity to ensure that their children are vaccinated with MMR. The 1st dose is usually given at 12 months of age and the 2nd dose at 4 to 5 years of age."

Dr Diarmuid O'Donovan, the HSE West's public health director for Galway, Mayo, and Roscommon, said the only way to prevent measles was by vaccination. He stressed that hand washing was "really important" in controlling the spread of measles and other infectious diseases.

The key symptoms to watch out for are: skin rash, high temperature, cough, runny nose, red or watery eyes.

Dr O'Donovan said it was "absolutely imperative" students who were ill did not attend the university until 4 days after the rash appeared and they were fully well. "Students are being advised to contact their GP by phone if unwell; they should not attend the GP clinic without ringing first."

Unvaccinated housemates of measles' sufferers should not attend college for a number of days depending on when they were exposed to the infection. This is to avoid transmitting measles to others.

[15] New Zealand (Auckland)
Date: Fri 30 Apr 2014

With measles continuing to spread through Auckland, authorities are reminding parents to check their children's immunisation status. 105 people in Auckland have caught measles so far this year [2014], with 21 requiring hospital treatment.

Most cases have been in the 10-19 age group -- an age group where people are less likely to be fully immunised (or immune from having had measles before widespread immunisation).

This week is Immunisation Week. Health authorities say that the best protection from measles is receiving 2 doses of the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine. While one of this week's themes is ensuring children get immunised 'on time, every time,' Auckland Regional Public Health Service (ARPHS) says it is never too late to catch up on any immunisations that may have been missed.

Medical Officer of Health Dr Richard Hoskins says the most frustrating aspect of this outbreak was that it could have been prevented if more people were immunised.

"Measles is highly infectious. When it finds its way into areas with low immunisation rates, it spreads rapidly -- as seen on the North Shore, where 52 cases are linked to Westlake Boys High School.

"While the Westlake outbreak is now over, we are still seeing 1-2 'sporadic' cases (cases with no known link to other cases) a week. Several of these people have gone on to infect others, particularly household members and waiting room contacts."

Measles can be a very serious illness, says Dr Hoskins, with one in 3 experiencing complications such as ear infections, pneumonia, bronchitis, or diarrhoea. While one in 10, on average, requires hospitalisation, admission rates in this outbreak have been higher.

Dr Hoskins urges parents to check with their GP that they, and their children, are fully up to date with their vaccinations. "It is never too late to catch up -- and there is no better time than right now."

Current MMR recommendations are:
- All children from age 15 months who have not had one dose of MMR should receive this as soon as possible.
- All children should receive their 2nd dose at 4 years of age, or at least 28 days after the 1st dose.
- All adults born after January 1969 who are not recorded as immunised, or who have only had one measles vaccination, should receive one dose of MMR as soon as possible, with a 2nd dose at least 28 days later for those who had no previous MMR.
- If in doubt, vaccinate. If medical records cannot be located, and there is any uncertainty as to whether someone has received 2 doses, an MMR can be given with no added risk.
- Immunisation is free.
