West Bank and Gaza Strip, additional information on suspected outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreak in livestock
--------------------------------------------------
The reportedly suspected FMD case in the Gaza strip [ProMED-mail posting 20130314.1587397] has been confirmed as FMD serotype A.

[Earlier, FAO EMPRES-Animal Health disclosed]:

Following the rumour of FMD reported in cattle in a holding in Rafah, Gaza Strip in March 2013, a team of experts from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) travelled to West Bank to investigate the situation and meet with veterinarians from the West Bank and from the Gaza Strip.

Epidemiological background: the field veterinarians of the Palestine veterinary authorities reportedly investigated 15 farms located around the 2 affected holdings which had clinical signs of FMD without finding any further indications of clinical FMD. All animals in this area are originating from Egypt and brought into the Gaza Strip using tunnels. The vaccination history of these animals is therefore not known. In the Gaza Strip the last FMD vaccination campaign took place in May 2012. Vaccination for 2013 is currently in the planning/procurement phase. FAO is assisting the Palestine Autonomous Territories Authorities to purchase vaccine for large and small ruminants.

[Since the origin of infection is, apparently, Egypt, the following genotyping results of an Egyptian isolate of FMDV serotype A (one of 3 genotyped samples), collected in 2012 and submitted to the World Reference Laboratory for FMD, Pirbright, are relevant:

Batch no: WRLFMD/2012/00032
Sender ref: R/280 (2)
Location: Al Zlefay, Zainia, Luxor, Upper Egypt, Egypt
Date collected: 9 Mar 2012
Date received by WRLFMD: 2 Oct 2012
Date received for sequencing: 22 Oct 2012
Species: cattle
Serotype: A
Topotype: Africa
Genotype/strain: G-IV

- Most closely related viruses:
1. A/EGY/20/2012; identity percentage: 100.00; topotype: Africa; Strain: G-IV
2. A/SUD/13/2011; identity percentage: 99.22; topotype: Africa; Strain: G-IV

- Most closely related reference viruses:
(see http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/prototypes.htm)
1. A/SUD/3/77 (GU566064); identity percentage: 86.38; topotype: Africa; strain: G-IV
2. A/GHA/16/73; identity percentage: 84.59; topotype: Africa; strain: G-IV

For the genotyping results of the other 2 strains (WRLFMD ref nos EGY/20/2012 and EGY/30/2012) and for the dendrogram covering all 3, please go to http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2012/WRLFMD-2012-00032%20A%20Egypt%202012.pdf.

It may be concluded that the FMD virus strain in the Gaza strip, March 2013, was serotype A, topotype Africa, strain G-IV. Vaccines against such strains should be included in the multivalent FMD vaccines applied for the protection of susceptible species in the Palestinian Authority (Gaza strip and West Bank) as well as in other adjacent territories such as Israel. - Mod.AS
