A dog has died from leptospirosis in Canberra, the 1st confirmed case in the capital region.

The deadly bacterial infection spreads via contaminated water, affecting a dog's kidneys and liver, often leaving them too unwell to be treated.

On Tuesday [28 Jun 2022], after being unwell for several days, a Jerrabomberra dog was referred to the Animal Referral Hospital in Pialligo, where her blood test was positive for leptospirosis. She was later euthanised.

The dog's 23-year-old owner, [CE], said she never thought her 2.5-year-old kelpie would have such a short life.

"I had picked her up just shy of 6 weeks and pretty much spent every living minute with her," [CE] said. "Even if I would go down to the shops to get milk or something, she would always get in the car with me.

"We had several dogs growing up, but she was my 1st dog. She was my baby. So this was just heartbreaking."

[CE] said the signs began last week when she couldn't get the dog out of bed on Friday morning [24 Jun 2022].

"When I woke up, I tried to get her to go to the toilet, but she literally didn't move. I tried to give her some water and left her some food, too, but she didn't eat any of it," [CE] said.

"She had no energy. We decided to take her to the vet, but she couldn't jump in the car, so we had to carry her. Eventually, she started vomiting. The vomit had blood in it. She had lost weight and her appetite."

The dog owner said it had all happened so quickly. "All of the signs just kind of hit at once. You could tell she was very upset and sad, because she wasn't wagging her tail as much as she normally was."

[CE] and her family took their dog to the vet in Queanbeyan on Friday, Saturday, and Monday [24, 25, and 27 Jun 2022], and she was referred to the Animal Recovery Hospital on Tuesday (28 Jun 2022).

"We'd never heard of the disease before, so it was a bit of a shock," [CE] said. "We tried retracing our steps for the past one or 2 months, but because I was so busy, we only stayed in the Canberra/Queanbeyan region, so we didn't go anywhere.

"The doctors couldn't really pinpoint it either, which is no one's fault, because it can be spread through rodents and mice, and there's a million factors as to how she could have gotten it, which is a scary thing."

[CE] urged other dog owners to listen to their vets.

"It's not worth the risk," she said. "If you haven't heard about it, do your research, and then you'll understand how quickly it can spread."

A vet from Animal Referral Hospital, where the dog was taken, Dr Jacob Michelsen, said although there was a vaccine for the disease, "Unfortunately, it's not particularly successful."

"There is a vaccine for leptospirosis which fights against the rat variant; however, this particular case wasn't of that variant," Dr Michelsen said. "This was of the _Leptospira interrogans_ variety.

"The question is, how much cross-protection is there in the vaccine? There might be some, but we really don't know how much.

"If your dog is unwell, take it to the vet; there's really not much you can do to prevent it.

"If you catch the disease early enough, you can treat the dogs successfully. If you don't, then by the time you know it, the dogs will experience kidney failure," he said.

The vet said leptospirosis would likely remain an uncommon disease in Canberra.

"Pet owners should be aware of the potential risk, but not worry too much about it."

"It is possible more cases will be detected now we know it is in the area, and vets will be looking for it," Dr Michelsen said. "However, it is unlikely we will see an outbreak with many more cases; most likely, it'll be an odd case here or there."

Queanbeyan-Palerang Regional Council has recommended vaccination for local dogs.

[Getting your dog vaccinated is critically important, but the vaccine may not be effective if it does not match the circulating serovar. It does depend on which serovars are in the vaccine and which are the cause of the problem. "Prevention of leptospirosis via vaccination is complicated by the fact that _Leptospira interrogans_ has more than 200 subtypes that can cause illness in animals and people. The available vaccines protect against only a handful of the most common subtypes infecting dogs, which limits their protective value. Nevertheless, the available vaccines are effective and safe when used as directed, and many veterinarians recommend the vaccination for dogs at risk for exposure."

"Leptospirosis is more common in areas with warm climates and high annual rainfall, but it can occur anywhere.

"Dogs are most commonly affected. Leptospirosis in cats is rare and appears to be mild, although very little is known about the disease in this species. [However, it is known cats can die from this disease, and currently there is no vaccine for cats. - Mod.TG] Common risk factors for leptospirosis in dogs residing in the United States [and likely anywhere - Mod.TG] include exposure to or drinking from rivers, lakes, or streams; roaming on rural properties (because of exposure to potentially infected wildlife, farm animals, or water sources); exposure to wild animal or farm animal species, even if in the backyard; and contact with rodents or other dogs. [Other exposure risks would be flood waters. Often in flooded areas, rodents, which frequently carry leptospirosis, are involved, and pets may not have clean sources of water in such disaster situations. - Mod.TG]

"Dogs can become infected and develop leptospirosis if their mucous membranes (or skin with any wound, such as a cut or scrape) come into contact with infected urine, urine-contaminated soil, water, food, or bedding; through a bite from an infected animal; by eating infected tissues or carcasses; and, rarely, through breeding. It can also be passed through the placenta from the mother dog to the puppies.

"The signs of leptospirosis in dogs vary. Some infected dogs do not show any signs of illness; some have a mild and transient illness and recover spontaneously, while others develop severe illness and death.

"Signs of leptospirosis may include fever, shivering, muscle tenderness, reluctance to move, increased thirst, changes in the frequency or amount of urination, dehydration, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, lethargy, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and mucous membranes), or painful inflammation within the eyes. The disease can cause kidney failure with or without liver failure. Dogs may occasionally develop severe lung disease and have difficulty breathing. Leptospirosis can cause bleeding disorders, which can lead to blood-tinged vomit, urine, stool, or saliva; nosebleeds; and pinpoint red spots (which may be visible on the gums and other mucous membranes or on light-colored skin). Affected dogs can also develop swollen legs (from fluid accumulation) or accumulate excess fluid in their chest or abdomen.

"Leptospirosis may be suspected based on the exposure history and signs shown by the dog, but many of these signs can also be seen with other diseases. In addition to a physical examination, your veterinarian may recommend several other tests such as blood tests, urine tests, radiographs (x-rays), and an ultrasound examination.

"Leptospirosis is generally treated with antibiotics and supportive care. When treated early and aggressively, the chances for recovery are good, but there is still a risk of permanent residual kidney or liver damage.

"Currently available vaccines effectively prevent leptospirosis and protect dogs for at least 12 months. Annual vaccination is recommended for at-risk dogs. Reducing your dog's exposure to possible sources of the _Leptospira_ bacteria can reduce its chances of infection.

"Although an infected pet dog presents a low risk of infection for you and your family, there is still some risk. If your dog has been diagnosed with leptospirosis, take the following precautions to protect yourself:
- administer antibiotics as prescribed by your veterinarian;
- avoid contact with your dog's urine;
- if your dog urinates in your home, quickly clean the area with a household disinfectant and wear gloves to avoid skin contact with the urine;
- encourage your dog to urinate away from standing water or areas where people or other animals will have access;
- wash your hands after handling your pet.

"If you are ill or if you have questions about leptospirosis in people, consult your physician. If you are pregnant or immunocompromised (due to medications, cancer treatment, HIV, or other conditions), consult your physician for advice."

Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that occurs worldwide. The disease is transmitted to humans by contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes usually with water or soil contaminated by the urine of infected animals. Carrier animals, such as rats, dogs, or cattle, are mostly asymptomatic but chronically infected with one of the several hundred serovars of pathogenic leptospira. Different leptospiral serovars are prevalent in particular geographical regions. In carrier animals with chronic renal infections, leptospira are excreted in urine for long periods or for the life of the animal. Leptospira can survive for weeks to months in warm fresh water or soil flooded with fresh water. Drinking contaminated water or food can also cause infection. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow flooding after heavy rainfall, for example, during the monsoon season (July-October).

Treatment with antibiotics (penicillin and doxycycline) can be effective, especially if started early in the disease. For very ill patients, intensive care support and intravenous (IV) antibiotics may be necessary. In a flood-affected area, leptospirosis chemoprophylaxis is 200 mg of doxycycline, once a week, for those exposed to contaminated floodwater or soil (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2018/infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/leptospirosis). Each 200 mg dose provides a benefit for up to 7 days, so the dose may be repeated if high-risk conditions persist longer than this.

Because of the relatively nonspecific nature of the clinical presentation of leptospirosis, its diagnosis cannot be made confidently without laboratory confirmation. The _Leptospira_ dipstick (DST) IgM dot-ELISA test kits (PanBio Integrated Diagnostics) can provide in-the-field testing of suspected patients (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC149700/). Confirmatory testing uses the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Molecular assays such as DNA PCR can also be used, if available. - Mods.TG/ML
