The United States border has been closed to seed potatoes from Alberta
after the plant pest golden nematode was found on 2 seed potato fields.
Staff with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency [CFIA] and Potato Growers of
Alberta [PGA] confirmed that CFIA and the US Department of Agriculture
[USDA] have agreed to close the border to prevent the pest's potential
spread. USDA and CFIA were in talks as of Tuesday [20 Nov 2007] to
determine when the border would open again.

Golden nematode and pale cyst nematode are both considered quarantine pests
because they can reduce yields of host crops, such as potatoes and
eggplants, by up to 80 per cent and can survive dormant in host soil for
decades. Both species of potato cyst nematode (PCN) have been found in 65
countries worldwide, including the US. Both have also been confirmed in
Newfoundland, while golden nematode is also found in Quebec and on
Vancouver Island. Alain Boucher, national manager of CFIA's potato cyst
nematode emergency section, said that the border closure is a "cautionary
measure" while soil samples are taken to see what populations of the pest,
if any, can be found in the 2 fields in question.

PGA noted in a statement on its website that out of 284 and 143 samples
taken on the 2 fields in question, respectively, only one each turned up
positive. Another round of tests with 610 samples in total from both fields
turned up negative for PCN. The province wide PCN survey, meanwhile, turned
up only the 2 positive samples out of 2721 in total from across the
province. Another 801 soil samples from the 2006 seed potato crop were also
PCN-negative, the growers' association reported.

Many US potato growers in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho are known to rely
on Alberta seed potatoes. "It is essential that trade resume within several
weeks to meet early season commitments," PGA said in its statement.

[Both golden (_Globodera rostochiensis_) and pale (_G. pallida_) cyst
nematodes cause serious crop losses in potato. They can also infect other
solanaceous crops and weeds. Symptoms on potato are stunting, yellowing,
and wilting of leaves as well as a reduced root system, which is abnormally
branched and brownish in colour. Damage to the crop varies from small
patches of poor growing plants to complete crop failure. Diseased plants
first occur in isolated patches and these become larger with each new crop
if potatoes are continually grown on the infested site. In light
infestations, potato plants may show no above ground symptoms, but yield
can be reduced. Light infestations can reduce tuber size, whereas heavy
infestations reduce both number and size of tubers.

The nematodes are not greatly influenced by soil type and temperature and
thrive wherever potatoes are grown. The pathogens survive in soil in the
absence of a host as cysts containing viable eggs. These can survive in
soil, which has not been planted to potatoes for up to 20 years. Spread
occurs via infected soil, water, wind, or on plant material. It takes about
6-7 years from introduction into a potato paddock before numbers of the
nematodes reach a detectable level. Disease management includes exclusion,
quarantine, and crop rotation with non-host species.

_G. rostochiensis_ is widely distributed in Europe, Africa, and Asia, and
occurs in parts of the Americas. It has been included on the alert list of
the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO). Its 1st report in Canada
was in 1965 in British Columbia. Strict sanitation measures are being
applied to try to prevent further spread in Canada.
