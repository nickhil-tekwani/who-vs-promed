Indonesia: Bird flu victim had no poultry contact
-------------------------------------------------
A 6-year-old Indonesian boy who died of bird flu last weekend [8 Jul
2007] had no apparent contact with poultry, an agriculture ministry
official said. The boy from Cilegon in Banten province, just west of
the capital Jakarta, was Indonesia's 81st bird flu victim.
Contact with infected birds is the most common form of transmission
of the deadly virus to humans, experts say. Memed Zulkarnaen,
Director of the Agriculture Ministry's bird flu unit, said no
infected poultry had been found within a radius of up to 300 meters
(984 ft) from the boy's home. "The Indonesian medical community is
still puzzled and does not understand from which source the victim
was infected with the bird flu virus," he said. "We are puzzled
because the H5N1 virus needs to 'stick' to an object such as poultry
and cannot freely circulate in the air," he said.
Asked whether there was a possibility the boy had contracted the
virus from another person, Mr Zulkarnaen said it was premature to
tell and investigations involving personnel from the UN's health and
agriculture agencies were ongoing.
Sardikin Giriputro, Deputy Director of Jakarta's Sulianti Saroso
Hospital, where the boy died, said on Tue [10 Jul 2007] that the boy
had visited relatives who lived near a zoo elsewhere in Banten
province [previously identified as the Bandung Zoo - Mod.CP], 4 days
before he fell sick.
Indonesia is the nation worst hit by avian influenza. It confirmed
its 1st human case in July 2005, but the source of infection in that
particular case was never determined.
Separately, on Wed [11 Jul 2007], the national committee overseeing
Indonesia's bird flu fight along with UNICEF were to begin
distributing 7000 protective kits to villages in Banten province,
where at least 10 bird flu deaths have occurred. The kits contain
gloves, masks, soap, an informational VCD (video compact disk), a
banner, and booklet. About 100 000 kits were distributed in high-risk
areas in May [2007], a statement from the committee said.
Indonesia stepped up its campaign this year [2007] to battle bird
flu, barring Jakarta residents from the popular practice of keeping
poultry in their backyards. Officials have been criticized for being
slow to act when avian influenza 1st appeared in the archipelago nation.

Indonesia: Distribution of cases by province
-----------------------------------------------
A 6-year-old boy (SZ), who lived at Komplek BPI in Kelurahan Panggung
Rawi, Cilegon Subdistrict, Cilegon Municipality, Banten, was
positively infected by avian influenza (AI) virus, based on RT-PCR
(Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction) Test of laboratories of the
National Board of Health Research and Development MOHRI and Eijkman
Molecular Biological Institution Jakarta, on 9 Jul 2007. This
information was received by the Center for Public Communication from
AI Post, DG of Disease Control and Environmental Health MOHRI on Mon
9 Jul 2007 [see also: Avian influenza, human (108): Indonesia
20070709.2187 and Avian influenza, human (109): Indonesia, WHO, to be
archived).
SZ had symptoms of high temperature, cough and breathing difficulty
on 1 Jul 2007. He was treated at Siloam Gleneagles Hospital on 5 Jul
2007 and then referred to Sulianti Saroso Infection Hospital, Jakarta
on the same day. On 8 Jul 2007, he died. Laboratory observation
results indicated that SZ suffered leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and
pneumonia. The risk factor is still not clear.
SZ is the 13th avian influenza positive case in Banten and the 102nd
in Indonesia (81 people have died). The Case Fatality Rate (CFR)
reaches 79.41 percent. The distribution of avian influenza sufferers
in Indonesia is presented in the following table:
