Dr. Calisher seeks information regarding whether vaccination with
Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) elicits responses that may increase
the severity of subsequent dengue (DHF).
There is no direct information. The available data are:
1. In vitro, serum from Thai donors with monotypic neutralizing
antibody to JEV failed to enhance dengue 2 virus; the relevance of
the assay for predicting in vivo outcomes is uncertain (Am J Trop Med
Hyg 1984; 33: 288-94).
2. Previous yellow fever (YF) vaccination decreased the interval to
detectable viremia in volunteers administered a live dengue 2 vaccine
candidate, though without an obvious increase in side effects (JID
1983; 148: 1055-60; 1984; 149: 1005-10).
3. Hundreds of thousands of US military, most vaccinated with YF
vaccine, spent a year in Vietnam in 1960s-70s. There are no records
of DHF occurring among them; there was a moderate incidence of dengue
fever.
4. Where dengue and JEV co-circulate (especially Thailand and
Vietnam), there are no cohort studies that assess JEV immunity
compared with dengue immunity (evaluated as monotypic neutralizing
antibody) as a risk factor for DHF. The assertion that most DHF
occurs in patients with a secondary dengue infection is true, but
labs are not using tests that can differentiate a dengue virus versus
JEV infection as the priming event.
5. JE vaccine given to children in Thailand with careful follow-up in
a phase 3 trial detected no increase in DHF for 2 years of followup
(this population already was extensively exposed to flaviviruses, so
the power was quite low) (NEJM 1988; 319: 608-14).
Our hypothesis regarding the factors contributing to severe dengue
says there are 3 independent variables:
1) infection with dengue virus that replicates efficiently to a high titer;
2) entry of cells via FcR by antibody dependent enhancement;
3) marked activation of a chemokine/T cell response.
A high virus load in an appropriately immune-primed person can cause
severe disease. Cross-reactive JEV antibody could up-regulate dengue
virus load. Cross-reactive T cell responses may contribute to
accelerated recovery from dengue (mild or inapparent disease) or to
more profound Tcell activation causing injury. These divergent
outcomes depend on the host and the viruses.
Based on current knowledge, it is difficult to predict what change in
dengue severity might be seen in the Torres Straits following JE
vaccination should a dengue outbreak occur at the right (wrong?)
time. Such a change in vaccine policy allows a potential
opportunity for a case-control, or possibly even a prospective,
study among vaccinated and unvaccinated populations to shed further
light on this issue. For now we can only find limited reassurance in
that we have yet to recognize severe dengue disease following JE, YF,
and TBE vaccination.

[Thanks to David Vaughn, Bruce Innis, and Patrick Kelley of the U.S.
Army for getting on this question and providing excellent
information. Makes me feel unusually good about paying my taxes.
Seems to me the best of this (to answer my question) is that Thai
children given JEV vaccine showed no increase in DHF for 2 years.
That is a good sign for the children in northern Queensland who will
be vaccinated against JEV and then potentially exposed (likelihood of
subsequent dengue infection very low) to one or more dengue viruses.
There certainly is opportunity for research here.
Let's cut the string with this definitive response. - Mod.CHC]
