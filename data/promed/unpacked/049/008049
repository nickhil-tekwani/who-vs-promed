[The only real puzzle with this OIE notification is why it took 4 and half months for Gaborone to inform Paris of this event. This is the 3rd elephant affected with anthrax in Chobe National Park in 2015; see 20150128.3126827 and 20150812.3573712 below. The 1st went down on 27 Jan 2015 and the 2nd on 6 Jul 2015, just a month before this 3rd elephant. Obviously the "official disposition" of the 2nd carcass left something of concern that affected the next elephant. While elephants do graze, they are mainly browsers and thus it might have been from blow fly vomit on shrub and bush leaves eaten when the elephants came to mourn their departed friend.

Anyone needing a map will find one embedded in this OIE notification. - Mod.MHJ
