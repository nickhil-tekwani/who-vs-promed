The Florida Department of Health in Marion County is advising residents that there has been an increase in mosquito-borne disease activity.

A horse tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus infection on 17 May 2018. That marks 4 animal cases in the county this year [2018]: 3 horses and an emu.

According to a news release, the department reminds residents and visitors to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes and to take basic precautions to limit exposure.

To protect from mosquitoes, "drain and cover:"
- Drain water from garbage cans, house gutters, buckets, pool covers, coolers, toys, flower pots or other containers where water has collected.
- Discard old tires, drums, bottles, cans, pots and pans, broken appliances and items not being used.
- Empty and clean birdbaths and pet's water bowls at least once or twice a week.
- Protect boats and vehicles from rain with tarps that don't accumulate water.
- Maintain swimming pools in good condition and appropriately chlorinated. Empty plastic swimming pools when not in use.
- Wear shoes, socks, and long pants and long sleeves.
- Repair broken screening on windows, doors, porches and patios.
- Use repellents according to the label. Use mosquito netting to protect children younger than 2 months old. For information about repellents, use the Environmental Protection Agency's search tool: http://cfpub.epa.gov/oppref/insect/#searchform.

The department conducts statewide surveillance for mosquito-borne illnesses, including West Nile virus infections, eastern equine encephalitis, St. Louis encephalitis, malaria, chikungunya and dengue. Residents are encouraged to report dead birds at http://legacy.myfwc.com/bird/default.asp.

[Emus are sensitive to this disease, so when emus are succumbing to it, it is a sure bet that the virus is circulating in the area.

Horse owners need to vaccine. Please do not delay vaccinating your animals. The vaccine for EEE is usually combined with West Nile virus and western equine encephalitis. If you have not vaccinated your horse before, then a series of 2 shots approximately 2-4 weeks apart is required, and then vaccination yearly. However, immunity to EEE wanes very quickly, in about 3 months. Consequently, if you are in an area with EEE circulating or you have a prolonged mosquito season, you should be vaccinating more frequently for the protection of your horse, as well as your peace of mind. - Mod.TG
