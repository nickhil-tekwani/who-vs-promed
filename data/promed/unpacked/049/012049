In the context of a surveillance initiative that 'Projeto +Coelho' has been carrying out since August 2017, Myxomatosis was diagnosed in a hare that had been hunted in Ã‰vora on [ 28 Oct 2018], confirmed by molecular tests conducted at the Virology Laboratory of INIAV IP, in Oeiras. Other 2 apparently healthy hares were hunted that day.

The positive animal, an adult female in good body condition, presented purulent conjunctivitis, edema of eyelids and in the perianal region. The laboratory diagnosis was based on the amplification of a DNA sequence that is specific to Myxomatosis virus, which enabled confirmation of the suspected diagnosis.

This is the 1st confirmed case of myxomatosis in Iberian hare (_Lepus granatensis_) in Portugal. The disease has been frequently reported in this species in Spain, and in European hare (_Lepus europaeus_) in the United Kingdom.

Myxomatosis is a notifiable disease but it is not of public health concern.

Projeto +Coelho and the Portuguese Veterinary and Food Service recommend follow-up of this case and increasing the surveillance efforts, and proper disposal of corpses and diseased hares in the affected area, as well as biosecurity measures of people, equipment and vehicles exposed to infected animals, and vector control. Translocation of hares and rabbits inside and outside the affected area is also to be avoided.

[Myxomatosis is a viral disease commonly observed in European wild rabbits (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_). In case of high prevalence among rabbits, hares can also become infected by myxoma virus. The virus is a natural pathogen of the South American rabbit (_Sylvilagus brasiliensis_), where it causes a relatively localized fibroma.

The myxoma virus is an example of a virus that has jumped to other species to produce an exotic disease and then coevolved with its new host. Hares (_Lepus_ spp.) are in the same family as rabbits (Leporidae), and can be infected by myxoma virus. The virus is transmitted via blood-feeding arthropods or by close contact between hares and infected rabbits or their excretions. In hares myxomatosis follows a prolonged course with multiple firm subcutaneous nodular masses at the head, back and limbs. - Mod.PMB
