Large swathes of Wairarapa and northern Hutt Valley are now a "high risk area" in the wake of an outbreak of one of the honey industry's most invasive diseases.

The management agency that monitors American Foulbrood (AFB) disease in New Zealand's bee population alerted beekeepers in the region to a "serious outbreak" centred in Martinborough, but also including Featherston, Greytown, Carterton and north and south of Upper Hutt.

The industry-funded agency said 275 of a single South Wairarapa beekeeper's hives were infected with the disease, across multiple sites regionwide. At least 14 of these sites had AFB-infected hives that had been "robbed out", meaning stronger nearby colonies had robbed its honey most likely transferring the disease in the process.

National AFB Management Plan manager Clifton King said it was the worst infestation he had seen in the 18 months he had been with the organisation. "This is definitely the largest one in recent times," he said.

The only way of controlling AFB was by burning infected hives before they were able to infect other populations, he said.

All of the infected hives in this instance were destroyed as was required by the Biosecurity Act. The beekeeper's remaining uninfected hives were now subject to twice yearly inspections until the annual incidence of AFB was less than 1%. The normal infestation rate across New Zealand hive populations was around 0.3%, King said.

Beekeepers in the risk area were advised to take a range of steps to detect any infection of their own hives as a result of this outbreak and prevent it spreading to their other hives.

Honey producer Manuka Health New Zealand, which has a base in Carterton, said the restrictions would not have a serious impact on their business because it already had a stringent monitoring programme.

Regional manager Rhys Casley said they checked their hives every week. "We've got almost 5000 hives, so we've very diligent at screening for AFB." He gave credit to the management agency for detecting the South Wairarapa-based outbreak and moving quickly to stamp it out. "It sounds like they have done a great job from what I can see," Casley said.

[American Foulbrood (AFB) is caused by _Paenibacillus larvae_, a spore-forming gram-positive bacterium known for its ability to cause this severe and notiÔ¨Åable disease of honey bees. _Paenibacillus larvae_ is endemic to bee colonies worldwide. Its spores are highly resilient and can survive in honey for years.

The infection can be transmitted to larvae by nurse bees or by spores remaining at the base of a brood cell. The susceptibility of larvae to AFB disease decreases with increasing age. Larvae cannot be infected later than 53 hours after the egg has hatched.

Larvae can be killed rapidly at an early age when they are curled at the base of uncapped brood cells. Adult worker bees will remove these dead larvae leaving only an empty cell. Other larvae will die later on in their development, when they are in an upright position, filling most of the brood cell. Often the larvae or pupae will die after brood cell capping.
