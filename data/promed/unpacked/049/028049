Disease risk for Norfolk's oilseed rape growers
-----------------------------------------------
Oilseed rape growers in west Norfolk may be hit harder than expected by
higher numbers of migrating aphids. Dr Mark Stevens, Broom's Barn, said
that crops may have been swamped by high numbers of aphids carrying the
_Turnip yellows virus_. The key virus hot spots include areas which might
have been influenced by migrating aphids from nearby horticultural crops,
and farmers closer to the "warmer" climate along the coast.

Tests for _Turnip yellows virus_ (TuYV) before Christmas confirmed high
levels in a number of crops. "Symptoms of TuYV infection were being picked
up in crops at the end of November [2009]," he said. "We'd not normally
expect to see these until the spring, indicating that the aphids infected
plants early and that autumn conditions were ideal for the virus to build
up in plants. While the abnormally cold start to the year will have helped
to kill off 99 per cent of these aphids, unfortunately the damage has
already been done."

Dr Stevens said that unprotected crops could see yields cut by up to a
quarter and in inoculated trials in 2009 losses of up to 30 per cent were
recorded. Trials at Broom's Barn reveal how important it is to select the
right seed treatment and suggest that current oilseed rape varieties have
little inbuilt resistance to TuYV.

[Based on molecular evidence, European non-sugar beet infecting strains of
_Beet western yellows virus_ (BWYV) have recently been reclassified as the
separate species _Turnip yellows virus_ (TuYV) in the genus _Polerovirus_
(_Luteoviridae_). TuVY is considered an emerging threat to European oilseed
rape production and possibly the most important viral disease of oilseed
rape in the UK preventing crops from reaching their genetic yield
potential. Crop infection rates of 80 per cent and losses of seed yields of
close to 50 per cent have been reported (for example from Australia). In
addition, yield and quality of oil from affected seeds is also reduced.
TuYV has a wide host range including all brassica crops, lettuce and many
weed species.

Symptoms may include reddening or purpling of leaf margins and interveinal
discolouration resembling some physiological or nutritional problems and
may therefore be difficult to identify. They are usually not expressed
before stem elongation and up to 6 months after infection. TuYV is
transmitted by aphid vectors, with the peach aphid (_Myzus persicae_)
considered the most important. Disease management may include insecticides
for vector control in crops and as seed treatments, as well as cultural
practices (for example, shelter belts or barrier plantings). Reliable
information on susceptibility levels of current crop varieties is not
available, but research is being carried out to identify potential genetic
TuYV resistance traits to be used in breeding programmes.
