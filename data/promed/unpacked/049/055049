Bird flu confirmed on Canada turkey farm
--------------------------
Tests have confirmed an outbreak of bird flu at a turkey farm near
Vancouver, but it appeared to be a less virulent strain and posed
little risk to humans, officials said on Saturday [24 Jan 2009].

More than 50 000 birds on the Abbotsford, British Columbia, farm will
be destroyed to ensure the avian influenza virus does not spread to
other farms, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) said.

Tests on sickened birds showed they had H5 avian influenza, but it
will be another day or more before the exact strain of the virus is
known and its pathogenicity, the agency said.

Pathogenicity indicates the severity of the illness to the birds.
Preliminary tests indicated that it was a low pathogenic strain, it said.

"Nobody has been infected by the virus," said Elizabeth Brodkin,
medical officer of the Fraser Health Authority.

The H5N1 strain of the virus can infect people and is responsible for
252 human deaths since 2003, according to the World Health Organization.

China on Saturday reported its 4th human death from H5N1 this month.

Twenty-three farms within 2 miles (3 km) of the farm in British
Columbia's Fraser Valley are under a quarantine as officials check to
make sure their flocks have not been infected.

Officials said the farm had followed all the rules designed to stop
and control the disease.

The area had bird flu outbreaks in 2004 and 2005. The 2004 outbreak
forced authorities to kill about 17 million farmed birds to stop the
disease from spreading. There were no human illnesses in either outbreak.

The inspection agency said it was moving quickly to cull the turkeys
to avoid a repeat of 2004, when the virus mutated to a highly
pathogenetic form before the outbreak was contained.

[Continual surveillance, and early detection are keys to diminishing
the impact of any disease. Depopulation of the index flock or herd is
an added measure to quickly control and eliminate a disease. There
are diseases where the cost of total eradication is more than the
industry can survive. Avian influenza can be devastating to the
poultry industry, but in some forms may be very problematic to humans
as well. This appears to be of low pathogenicity but they are taking
no chances. The CFIA and the affected area are to be applauded for
their quick action. - Mod.TG]
