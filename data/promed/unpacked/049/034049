The Norwegian Institute of Public Health warns of an ongoing outbreak of the bacterium _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ in more than 10 of the country's hospitals. Cases of infection have now been reported in three of the country's four health regions.

The outbreak was discovered in November 2021 when 3 patients admitted to UNN Tromso [University Hospital of North Norway, located in Tromso (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_Hospital_of_North_Norway)] for COVID-19 became seriously ill and died of blood poisoning with identical bacterial strains. Helse Nord [Northern Norway Regional Health Authority (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_Hospital_of_North_Norway)] then established an outbreak group, and so far they have identified a total of 11 patients with the same bacterial strain from different hospitals in the region.

As part of the national handling of such incidents, the National Institute of Public Health (NIPH) asked all health regions to investigate further whether they could identify patients associated with the outbreak. Infection has now been detected in another 15 patients in Health South-East and 3 in Health Central Norway.

There is no definite connection between most patients who have been diagnosed with this bacterium, and further investigations are ongoing.

_P. aeruginosa_ is a common bacterium that thrives in water and humid environments, as well as in a hospital environment. It rarely causes disease in healthy people but can cause serious infection in intensive care patients and patients with weakened immune systems.

Whole genome analyzes of the bacterium (gene profile) [whole genome sequencing] have shown that the outbreak strain has not previously been described in Norway or in other countries.

FHI [Norwegian Institute of Public Health (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Institute_of_Public_Health)] is now contributing to the outbreak work by coordinating a group from all health regions to get an overview of the situation and to limit the outbreak.

The working group works systematically to find routes of infection, whether there may be a possible common source of infection, and to implement necessary infection control measures that can stop the outbreak.

[This multi-regional, nosocomial outbreak of _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ infections in Norway involves 29 patients, including at least 3 deaths from _P. aeruginosa_ sepsis. The outbreak strain was confirmed by whole genome sequencing and has reportedly not previously been described in Norway or in other countries. We are not told its susceptibility to antimicrobial drugs.

_P. aeruginosa_, a non-fermentative, Gram-negative bacterium commonly occurring in soil and water, is an opportunistic pathogen and an important cause of healthcare-associated infections. It is responsible for a wide variety of clinical syndromes, including wound, urinary tract, and bloodstream infections, meningitis, and pneumonia.

Outbreaks of _P. aeruginosa_ infections in the past have been traced to a variety of sources (https://www.isid.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ISID_GUIDE_PSEUDOMONAS_AERUGINOSA.pdf). Water is a common source for nosocomial outbreaks of _P. aeruginosa_ infection and the formation of biofilms on environmental surfaces is well known to cause difficulties in their eradication. In some outbreaks, colonized healthcare workers (HCWs) have transmitted _P. aeruginosa_ to patients and strict adherence to hand disinfection policies were frequently effective in controlling outbreaks (http://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2334-9-70). One study found that long or artificial fingernails were a risk factor for colonization of the hands of HCWs (https://doi.org/10.1086/501739).

_P. aeruginosa_ can contaminate disinfecting solutions, such as 10% povidone-iodine, chlorhexidine, and quaternary ammonium salts (https://journals.asm.org/doi/pdf/10.1128/am.21.6.1058-1063.1971, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2167968/, https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/349723), and cause infection when these solutions are used for cutaneous disinfection or when used to decontaminated medical equipment (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/661266, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/13533422/). Inadequately decontaminated endoscopes have served as the source of _P. aeruginosa_ infection, including bronchoscopes (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa021808) and GI endoscopes used for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) (https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/infection-control-and-hospital-epidemiology/article/abs/multidrugresistant-pseudomonas-aeruginosa-cholangitis-after-endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography-failure-of-routine-endoscope-cultures-to-prevent-an-outbreak/74CF5ECD4F17E1AAB940C9760ECA3626).

Norway is divided into 5 geographical regions: Northern, Tr√∏ndelag (central Norway), Western, Southern, and Eastern Norway (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_Norway). A map of Norway showing its 5 regions can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_Norway#/media/File:Norske_landsdeler_H.png.

More information on this outbreak as the investigation proceeds would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
