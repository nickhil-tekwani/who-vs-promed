Measles in Switzerland as monitored by the Swiss Sentinel Surveillance Network
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ProMED-mail reported on 14 May 2001 [see above 2 confirmed cases of
measles in El Salvador. The 2 young men had travelled during April in
Spain, France, and Switzerland. In these 3 countries measles is endemic and
cases have been reported recently.
Measles has been monitored in Switzerland since 1986 by the Swiss Sentinel
Surveillance Network (SSSN). Approximately 250 general practitioners,
internists and pediatricians in private practices send weekly reports of
clinical measles cases to the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health
(SFOPH). The sentinel physicians cover approximately 3.5% of all
consultations by these specialities in Switzerland.
In 1999 and 2000, the SSSN reported 36 and 24 cases of clinical measles
respectively. A total number of 800 (1999) and 600 (2000) clinical cases
was estimated for Switzerland. This corresponds to an annual incidence of
11 and 8 clinical cases per 100 000 population respectively. Two-thirds of
cases were reported in children younger than 8 years. Of cases with
information regarding vaccination status, 45% (1999) and 50% (2000) had
received at least one dose of MMR vaccine.
In 1999 blood samples of 47% of patients were sent to a laboratory for
serology and 47% of these had significant levels of specific IgM. In 2000,
however, recent infection was confirmed by serology in only 9% of tested
cases (45% of all cases). It is not known which measles virus strains are
circulating in Switzerland.
