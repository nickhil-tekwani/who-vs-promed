Illinois: first confirmed human case of eastern equine encephalitis
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The state on Mon 14 Jul 2003 reported this year's first case of a
mosquitoborne illness in humans, but the disease wasn't a consequence of
West Nile virus infection. A 45 year old Evanston woman was infected with
eastern equine encephalitis virus, [another mosquitoborne virus responsible
for infrequent but severe encephalitis in humans]. She became ill on 12 Jun
2003 and suffered a stiff neck and severe headache. She did not require
hospital admission and has recovered, the Illinois Public Health Department
said.
There have been 153 confirmed cases of eastern equine encephalitis in the
United States since 1964, mostly in north eastern states. Symptoms range
from mild flu-like illness to death. In Illinois, birds have been infected
with eastern equine encephalitis virus, but the Evanston woman is the first
known human case. It's not known whether she was bitten in the Evanston
area or in south eastern Wisconsin, where she had recently traveled.
So far this year, 9 birds have been found infected with West Nile virus in
Illinois. No human cases have been reported yet. West Nile generally
doesn't occur in people until late July. In 2002, Illinois led the nation
with 877 West Nile infections, including 64 deaths.

[Eastern equine encephalitis virus and West Nile virus are unrelated
arthropod-borne viruses, the former a member of the family _Togaviridae_
and the latter a member of the family _Flaviviridae_. Vaccines are
available for protection of horses against both viruses, but these vaccines
are not approved for use in humans. - Mod.CP]
