The attack of chikungunya in the Kepanjen Subdistrict territory,
Kebupaten Malang, continued to increase. Moreover, since yesterday
afternoon [01 Dec 2007], the Kepanjen Community Health Centre was
appointed as an emergency [unit].

The data in the Kepanjen Community Health Centre indicated that until
yesterday afternoon [01 Dec 2007] 181 residents were recorded as
having been attacked by the illness resulting from [virus transmitted
by] bites of _Aedes albopictus_ mosquitoes.

This incident not only continued increasing the [numbers of]
sufferers, but also increasingly expanded places that were endemic
[epidemic]. On last Wednesday (28 Nov [2007]) it was recorded that
124 residents [were] attacked [by the virus] in 4 villages, as of
yesterday [01 Dec 2007] it had spread to 7 villages from 18 villages
in the Kepanjen Subdistrict.

"Because of the development" (of the) "quite significant spreading,
we have been designated an emergency area," the Administration of the
Kepanjen, Community Health Centre, Sri Lesmono Hadi, reported
yesterday [01 Dec 2007].

"From the beginning when it was [1st] recognized, it [cases] has
risen almost 6-fold. At first 26 sufferers were identified, but now
[numbers of cases] have reached 181, which does not preclude the
possibility of continuing increase," he explained.

Lesmono said, that the health center officials were carrying out data
collection and carrying out the early prevention, such as public
education about chikunguya as well as the method of preventing it.

"Apart from the action that involved the active role (of the)
community, we also reduced [transmission] with [mosquito] abatement
and fumigation," he said. Especially, provision of dust for abatement
and fumigation will be carried out according to results of
surveillance and investigation of the presence of larvae and [adult]
mosquitoes. The action must be carried out in accordance with the
[established] procedures. If not, the effect could be worse.

Of several villages that were found with sufferers of chikunguya,
just 2 villages were fumigated.

Lesmono added, apart from carrying out the prevention in the endemic
[epidemic] chikungunya area he was also concentrating on 3 villages
that were not yet attacked [by the virus]. They are the Ardirejo
Village, Kemiri, and Tegalsari. These 3 villages are around the 7
villages that have been attacked by chikungunya [virus], so are in
danger [of spread].

"With the capacity to fly 100 metres, there is the possibility that
it [the virus] would also spread to the other areas." Because of that
we also continued to carry out monitoring.

Lesmono explained, that with this disease the sufferer initially has
high fever, accompanied by headache and nausea. As the condition
continues, the sufferer has pain "in each bone in his body." The pain
usually lasts one week. If they are not given medical treatment
immediately, it will result in temporary paralysis. [The paralysis
mentioned here may be due to the acute arthralgia and myalgia, making
these patients reluctant to move. - Mod.TY]

[Although there still is not information about laboratory
confirmation of chikungunya virus being responsible for this
outbreak, the severe arthralgia reported certainly is compatible with
that infection.
