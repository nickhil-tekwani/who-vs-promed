Farmers may halt spread on legal advice (The Press) (New Zealand) by Howard
Keene
Farmers may "think twice" about spreading rabbit calicivirus after a legal
opinion that says it is an offence to do so.
The legal opinion obtained by the Canterbury and Otago regional councils
contradicts Government advice given to farmers.
He said the opinion found that spreading the disease was illegal under the
Animals Act and the Biosecurity Act. The opinion opened up the possibility
of criminal liability from people adversely affected by RCD.
Tony Wall, of Simons Pass station, said some farmers would now think twice
about spreading the disease, but others would continue.
Last week high country farmers admitted to spreading the virus after saying
they had assurances from Ministry of Agriculture chief veterinary officer
Barry O'Neil that they had not broken the law by spreading the virus.
Cr Christine Kelland, of South Canterbury, said the public perception was
that the farmers had acted legally. Councillors voted six to four to urge
the Government to allow an appropriate strain of RCD to be legally imported.
The council voted not to help farmers spread the virus under its present
status

The NZ Government have just legalised the use of RHD as a biocontrol.The
Government has said it will not help the farmers spread the virus. They
have been told to just keep on doing what they have been doing (using
carrot bait drops). The Minister of Health, Bill English has said the risk
to humans is low but he is keeping an open mind on the subject.

The Minister for Biosecurity, Simon Upton, says now the rabbit calicivirus
disease (RCD) is present in New Zealand, the Government has to face reality
and allow farmers to spread the disease.
Now Mr Upton says the Government has decided to pass regulations to clarify
the legality of spreading RCD which was classified as an unwanted organism.
There have been conflicting views of whether it was legal to spread RCD
once it was illegally imported into the country.
The regulations will not be retrospective and the Government has indicated
that it still considers the importation of RCD as a serious breach of law
that should be punished.
It is unlikely that farmers who had spread the disease, once it was here,
will be charged with any offence, due to the public announcement by MAF
officials that it was not against the law.
The Department of Conservation is being asked to handle the problem of
predators switching from rabbits to endangered native wildlife.
MAF officials will continue to gather more information about the virus.
Areas identified for immediate research include characterising the virus
and testing its virulence, so that its effectiveness can be determined.
