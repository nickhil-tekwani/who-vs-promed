October 14, 1997. An advanced article from the Oct-Dec 1997 issue of
Emerging Infectious Diseases, Vol 3, No. 4
Irradiation Pasteurization of Solid Foods: Taking Food Safety to the Next
Level. Michael T. Osterholm and Morris E. Potter
ProMED-mail summary:

Just as thermal pasteurization of milk raised public concerns in the last
century, proposed irradiation pasteurization of solid foods has roused
public opposition. The argument that better sanitation in food processing
and thorough cooking obviate the need for using irradiation technologies is
not applicable to all foods. Foods that are by definition designed to be
eaten raw or undercooked present hazards, even when sanitation is at a
state-of-the-art level.
While it is true that new technologies are being investigated, irradiation
pasteurization is a well-established process that is used in medical supply
manufacture, but one which is not well understood by consumers. By using
low-dose gamma rays in combination with electrically generated X-rays and
electron beams for irradiation, in combination with a consistently high
level of sanitation, can eliminate most food borne pathogens from most
foods and at the same time eliminate environmental concerns about Cobalt 60.
As it becomes more and more obvious that new food borne pathogens are
emerging before all food safety problems are resolved, the opportunities
for infections increase. Irradiation pasteurization is a way to meet both
health threats.
