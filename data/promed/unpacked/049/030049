[This report provides some additional details on this case reported
in ProMED-mail archive no. 20110527.1619. Mod.TY]

An 8-year-old resident of rural Humboldt County, has become the 3rd
person in the United States known to have recovered from rabies
infection without receiving the rabies vaccine, through the efforts of
a team of dedicated physicians, nurses, and therapists at UC Davis
Children's Hospital.

The hospital team was led by Jean Wiedeman, associate professor of
pediatric infectious diseases. Wiedeman coordinated the patient's care
with state, local, and federal officials at the US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC), the California Department of Public
Health's Encephalitis and Special Investigations Section, and county
health departments in Humboldt and Sacramento counties.

While it is not known how she became infected, public health
officials suspect she may have encountered a feral cat near her
elementary school in the tiny town of Willow Creek, California, near
the Humboldt County border with Trinity County, though the infected
animal never was found. She did not receive post-exposure prophylaxis
[PEP], a series of antiviral inoculations administered following
infection, because the date and nature of her exposure is not known.
Rabies is virtually always fatal without PEP.

Samples of the girl's blood and spinal fluid were provided to the
state Encephalitis and Special Investigations Section of the
California Department of Public Health, directed by Carol Glaser, a
physician and veterinarian and associate professor of pediatric
infectious diseases at UC San Francisco. Test results returned on 5
May [2011] indicated that the girl had rabies.

The girl was first admitted to the intensive care unit and then she
graduated to the step-down unit. As time passed, however, the girl's
immune response gave Wiedeman and the rest of her health-care team and
family reason for hope.

[There has been controversy about the effectiveness of the Wisconsin
protocol. It certainly appeared to work well in this case, no doubt
aided by the patient's vigorous immune response, as the attending
physicians noted. The patient survived and her condition improved
sufficiently to be released from the intensive care unit.

The type of confirmatory laboratory test used is not indicated in
this report, but presumably was serological. Presence of
rabies-specific antibodies in blood and CSF is indicative of exposure
to rabies virus. ProMED-mail will be interested to know if the girl
suffers sequelae from her infection.

Dr Martin Haditsch cautioned in ProMED-mail archive no. 20110606.1728
that there is not a reasonable expectation that people infected with
rabies virus and develop clinical disease will survive. This
underscores the need for timely post-exposure treatment (PET) of
animal bites. Unfortunately, in the case above there was no history of
the patient being bitten, so PET was not applied.
