Here in Manchester, England, we have discussed the situation in New York
and decided not to insist on spraying of flights arriving at our airport
(the third largest in the UK). During the plague in India scare in 1994
the UK insisted on spraying aircraft arriving from India but no-one else
in Europe did. The result was great confusion amongst airlines and a
certain degree of antipathy from other countries.
Do you know of anyone who has carried out a risk assessment on this? I
would have thought that the chances of an infected mosquito getting onto
an aircraft at any of New York's airports would be small. The chances
that it would survive a long (7 hours) flight might be, what, less than
50-50? We would then have to consider how likely it would be for this
mosquito to find and infect a suitable host that would then be the start
of a reservoir of infection. I believe we do have mosquitoes over here
that could carry the virus and so infect humans, but as winter is now
approaching rapidly I don't think this is a big threat.
Of course, if an infected mosquito did get on board at JFK [New York it
could
present a hazard to passengers in the cabin. This would seem to me to
carry a higher relative risk of causing trouble than a scenario in which
the infection became enzootic in the UK. I haven't heard of any UK
visitors to New York going down with a West Nile-like illness. If
anyone does then the most likely explanation for their illness would be
exposure whilst actually in the USA, not on board an aircraft.
As has been said before on ProMED-mail, we should regard this as a wake-up
call.
