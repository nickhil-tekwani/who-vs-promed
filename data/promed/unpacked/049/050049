The FBI and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are
investigating the disappearance from a New Jersey research lab of at
least 3 mice carrying a deadly strain of plague. The rodents have
been missing for 2 weeks.
Sources say FBI agents and bioterrorism experts are interviewing and
polygraphing employees at the University of Medicine and Dentistry in
Newark, N.J., the location of the lab run by the Public Health
Research Institute, a leading center for research on infectious
diseases.
There are no indications of terrorism.
"The FBI responded to the matter, and we dedicated a great number of
agents as well as a large number of resources to the investigation,
which is still ongoing," said Special Agent Steve Siegel, a spokesman
for the FBI's Newark field office. "We're satisfied that there is no
public safety risk and there doesn't seem to be any nexus to criminal
activity or terrorism."
New Jersey officials also are downplaying the health risk. They
believe the infected mice probably died quickly.
However, some government officials are deeply concerned about what
the case says about security of some of the most deadly infectious
disease projects and research labs.
One source admitted that while officials are saying there is minimal
health risk, no one can be entirely certain.

[There is minimal information provided, but "3 mice" possibly
represents only a single box of such animals in a BSL-3 facility.
Occam's razor would indicate a stupid mistake, but as the loss was
noted 2 weeks ago, all probable explanations will have been
investigated and the answer is still being sought. If the mice had
died, been incinerated, and the box emptied, cleaned, and sterilized,
all traces will have been lost, along with any memories of what had
happened. But the card for the box should have been kept along with
any comments.
If this were a break-in by Friends of the Earth, there would have
been ancillary damage unless this has been suppressed. They have the
experience to carry out such a "raid" -- if raid it was.
Clearly those involved are assuming that the mice have died, if they
were removed.
Odd, but those with experience of such facilities probably have
plenty of pre-Homeland Security war stories. - Mod.MHJ]
