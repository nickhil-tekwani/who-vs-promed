Deadlier chemicals, larger supply, and low manufacturer costs may have led to a recent spike in emergency visits related to a popular drug called "spice," according to Mark Ryan, the director of the Louisiana Poison Center.

MAB-CHMINACA, a synthetic marijuana compound, is a designer drug, sold under the name "Mojo" and "Spice" that has become popular among its users, Ryan says.

"That particular one can be purchased readily and cheaply by the labs in China," Ryan said."...Just for some reason, it exploded in popularity. We've seen it in Texas, in the Lafayette, Baton Rouge, and New Orleans [Louisiana] areas, along with cities in Mississippi and Alabama."

In February [2015], according to Ryan, there were more than 110 cases at a Baton Rouge area hospital related to the designer drug.

East Baton Rouge Coroner Dr Beau Clark said there was one death directly related to synthetic marijuana use. Clark also said in another person's death, the use of the drug contributed to their death.

"These synthetics have been around since 2009 here in the United States," Ryan said. "There are a lot of them. There's over 300 that we know of now. Some of them never gain large popularity; they're not widely used. They kind of stay off the chart but some of them though, get put out, on the blog sites, and they seem to be liked by the users."

Louisiana banned MAB-CHMINACA in October 2014, after more than 125 residents sought out medical attention after using the drug over a 3-week period. The ban added the full chemical compound N- (1-amino-3, 3-dimethyl-1-oxobutan-2-yl)-1-(cyclohexylmethyl)-1H-indazole-3-carboxamide to the list of Schedule 1 controlled dangerous substances.

"There's a lot of them out there right now, it just seems like there's a large amount of this particular one, that's been distributed in the last 6 months or so," Ryan said. And because it's a large amount out there, and it does seem to cause worst symptoms, that we're seeing these guys show up in the emergency department again."

Clark said some of these drugs are sold legally therefore its accessibility is quite easy to get. "They sell it at convenience stores and it's not FDA related, and it's poisonous," he said. "It's some chemical compound that has been adulterated to the point that it's poison.

[Coroner Clark, who stated these synthetic drugs are poison, is right. An individual using them may get high, may get a buzz, and can very easily die. These synthetic chemicals are very dangerous to living beings.

Marijuana contains THC or tetrahydrocannabinol, the psychoactive component of the cannabis plant. However, synthetic marijuana contains other ingredients and goes by a variety of names; among them are K2, spice, mexxy, black mamba, fake weed, Yucatan fire, skunk, moon rocks, and others.

Some of these synthetic compounds are promoted as herbal products, with label claims that they contain "natural" psychoactive material taken from a variety of plants. Spice products (and the others as well) may contain some dried plant material (not necessarily natural cannabis), but chemical analyses show that their active ingredients are synthetic (or designer) cannabinoid compounds. However, tests have shown that it is not a single product. For example, black mamba contains synthetic cannabinoid AM-2001 and oleamide, an oleic acid.

The synthetic cannabinoids are not THC, but the body reacts to them as if it were reacting to the cannabinoids in cannabis. However, the synthetic variety can cause long-term problems, including long-term psychotic disorders.

The variety of synthetic cannabinoids is large and apparently constantly shifting to avoid detection and regulation by law enforcement. Consequently, it also makes it much harder on the physicians to stabilize and treat an individual who has had an overdose, or even a reaction to a synthetic hallucinogen.

The UK and the US have regulated a number of these substances, including cannabicyclohexanol, JWH-018, JWH-073, or HU-210. These substances are illegal to possess or use and are considered banned substances with jail terms of varying lengths, depending upon which country's laws are examined.

These synthetic products produce a longer lasting response, potentially in some people unexpected psychotic episodes for the remainder of their life, and apparently can "hook" people within seconds, despite near-death experiences.

Some states in the US have legalized the use of natural cannabis products. Therefore, in an effort to extend the natural product, and produce a desirable and longer lasting "high," the synthetic product may be added to the natural product and unsuspecting customers may suffer untoward effects and even death.

The sad commentary is that more people are likely to try this potentially more lethal synthetic version believing it may be safer, which is based on hype, not reality. - Mod.TG
