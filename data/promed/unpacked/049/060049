As of 17 Dec 2019, CDC has received reports of 38 confirmed [human] cases of eastern equine encephalitis virus disease for this year, including 15 deaths. Cases have been reported from the following 10 states:
Alabama (1)
Connecticut (4)
Georgia (1)
Indiana (1)
Massachusetts (12)
Michigan (10)
New Jersey (4)
North Carolina (1)

[This latest report increases the number of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) cases by one case, from 37 reported on 9 Dec 2019 to 38 reported yesterday (17 Dec 2019) and the number of states in which the cases occurred from 9 to 10. EEE virus transmission has ended for the season in those states that have had killing frosts that bring mosquito activity to a halt. It is unlikely that additional human or equine EEE cases will occur in 2019, with the possible exception of Florida.

As mentioned above, in a series of ProMED-mail posts and by the CDC, 2019 has indeed been an active year for EEEV transmission with cases in humans and in horses. The report above does not mention cases of EEE in horses. There have been triple the number of horse cases over human cases this year (2019). As mentioned in the previous ProMED-mail post, horse owners in eastern and upper midwestern states should vaccinate their animals. As that earlier report states, there is no commercially available vaccine for humans. The sporadic nature of the relatively few human cases that occur annually, the extremely high cost of developing a vaccine for people, and the difficulty in identifying a target population to vaccinate, as the authors mention, currently are insurmountable barriers to EEEV vaccine development. - Mod.TY
