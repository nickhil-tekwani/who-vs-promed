Emergency report
Text of an e-mail received on 17 Sep 2000 from Dr Emily Mmamakgaba
Mogajane, Chief Director, Agricultural Production, National Department of
Agriculture, Pretoria:
Report date: 17 Sep 2000.
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, post-mortem and laboratory.
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 12 Sep 2000.
Estimated date of first infection: 7 Sep 2000.
Outbreaks:
Location No. of outbreaks
District of Camperdown, 1 farm
Kwazulu-Natal province
(29ยบ 45' S - 30ยบ 32' E)
Description of affected population: pigs.
Total number of animals in the outbreak:
species susceptible cases deaths destroyed slaughtered
bov 6 0 0 6 0
ovi 5 0 0 5 0
cap 10 0 0 10 0
sui 726 247 83 643 0
Diagnosis: a suspicion of viral disease was raised after pigs on the farm
showed vesicular lesions in the mouth and on the feet. Samples were
immediately collected for laboratory investigations.
A. Laboratory where diagnosis was made: Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute,
Exotic Diseases Section.
B. Diagnostic tests used: liquid phase blocking ELISA(1), 3ABC ELISA, virus
neutralisation test, PCR(2), virus isolation on primary pig kidney cells
(results of virus isolation awaited).
C. Causal agent: virus type O.
Epidemiology:
A. Source of agent / origin of infection: investigations immediately
carried out revealed that swill was illegally obtained from a visiting
shipping carrier at Durban harbour and fed to the pigs.
B. Mode of spread: ingestion of swill and spread by contact within the
affected piggery.
C. Other epidemiological details: this is the first occurrence of foot and
mouth disease virus type O in South Africa. Intensive investigations
already under way indicate that there has been no further spread of the
infection to other properties. Therefore, the outbreak can be regarded as
an isolated incident and confined to one farm only.
Control measures during reporting period:
- Stamping out was immediately carried out and completed on 17 September.
Carcasses were buried. The premises are in the process of being disinfected
and will be cordoned off with security wire to prevent any access to the
depopulated area.
- The farm and all surrounding farms within a 10-km-radius zone have been
placed under strict quarantine restrictions, including road blocks and a
prohibition on movement. Intensive short-interval inspections of all
surrounding farms within the zone have already commenced and will be
maintained for at least the next 30 days.
- A further 20-km-radius surveillance zone has been declared around the 10
km restriction zone with intensive zoosanitary measures instituted,
including movement control and intensive inspections on all premises.
(1) ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
(2) PCR: polymerase chain reaction.
