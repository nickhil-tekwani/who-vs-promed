Approximately 150 to 500 outbreaks of salmonellosis are reported per year
in Hungary, with 700 to 8800 outbreak-associated cases and 8 to 14 fatal
cases per year (1970 to 2000).
_Salmonella spp._ accounted for 73 percent of all food-related outbreaks
reported during 1990 to 1992; 63.7 percent during 1993 to 1998. Four
waterborne outbreaks were reported during 1986 to 1996.
A graph depicting the incidence and rate of salmonellosis in Hungary is
available at

_S. Enteritidis_ accounted for 81.0 percent of clinical isolates in 1993,
increasing to 95.7 percent in 2000. _S. Typhimurium_ accounted for 5.4
percent of isolates in 1993, and 1.5 percent in 2000.
Four percent of slaughtered chickens are contaminated by salmonellae. _S.
Typhimurium_ DT104 has been demonstrated in turkeys, pigs, geese and other
animals since 1997, most often in turkeys.
Notable outbreak: 1996 - An outbreak (5243 cases) of _S. Enteritidis_ PT 6
infection was ascribed to contaminated strawberry syrup.
