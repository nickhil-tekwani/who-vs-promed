A total of about 34 000 people from some 150 countries and territories converge on the Kirara-hama beach in Yamaguchi, Japan, 29 Jul 2015, to kick off the 23rd World Scout Jamboree.

Sweden's health authority is urging nearly 2000 scouts returning from a gathering in Japan to get medical treatment after a suspected outbreak of meningitis. The Swedish Public Health Agency on Monday said 1 Swedish participant was likely to have contracted the disease at the World Scout Jamboree. 2 other cases were under investigation.

The agency also said 3 cases have been reported in Scotland.

The Scout Association of Japan said it was aware of the cases in Scotland, and that it had warned others who had camped near the Scottish scouts, including groups from Sweden, Switzerland, France, Finland, the United States and Japan.

An estimated 30 000 scouts from around the world attended the 28 Jul - 8 Aug 2015 event in Kirara-hama in western Japan, including 1900 from Sweden.

The Swedish health agency urged returning participants to seek preventive treatment as a precaution, even if they're not feeling sick.

Meningitis is a bacterial infection of the lining surrounding the brain and spinal cord that most commonly affects children and teenagers.

3 Scots scouts are suffering from meningitis, which they contracted during a jamboree in Japan. 2 cases of meningococcal disease -- the most common cause of bacterial meningitis -- were confirmed last week, but a further teenager was found to be suffering from the condition in the last few days. All 3 are aged between 14 and 18 and are from the Highlands.

The 3 were in a group of around 30 from the north of Scotland who were in Kirara-hama, Japan, along with another 150 Scots, to attend an international Scout jamboree which was attended by 33 000 teenagers from around the globe.

They returned on 8 Aug [2015] and it was only after arrival home they began to exhibit signs of the illness.

All 3 Scouts were treated in hospital and are "recovering well". An Incident Management Team led by Health Protection Scotland and NHS boards identified all close contacts and gave them antibiotics and immunisation as a precautionary measure. HPS also sent an "advise and inform" letter to the participants from other units in Scotland who attended the Jamboree, and approximately 4000 letters were also issued to other participants in the rest of UK alerting them to the signs and symptoms of disease.

There have been no other reported British cases but on Monday [17 Aug 2015] the Public Health Agency of Sweden reported 3 suspected cases of meningococcal infection in Swedish participants who attended the same jamboree.

[ProMED-mail thanks Camden Choo for the submission.

_Neisseria meningitidis_ only infects humans; there is no animal reservoir and the organism dies quickly outside the human host. _N. meningitidis_ colonizes the mucosal membranes of the nose and throat; up to 5-10 percent of a population may be asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriers, but the carrier rate may be higher in epidemic situations. Droplets of nasopharyngeal secretions from these carriers are responsible for the spread of the disease. Close and prolonged contact with an infected person or a carrier facilitates the spread of the disease. The average incubation period is 4 days, but can range between 2 and 10 days.

The news reports say that antibiotics and immunization are being given to close contacts as precautionary measures. The risk for acquiring meningococcal disease in close contacts is 500-800 times greater than among the general population (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm). Effective prophylactic antibiotic regimens for adults include: rifampin 600 mg orally twice daily for 2 days; ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally as a single dose; and ceftriaxone 250 mg as a single intramuscular injection.

Several meningococcal vaccines are available to control the disease during an outbreak. Immunity following use of a meningococcal vaccine is specific for the capsular polysaccharide that the vaccine contains, with no cross-protection against infection due to other meningococcal polysaccharide groups. Although there are at least 13 _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroups, based on the antigenic specificity of their capsular polysaccharides, disease due serogroups A, B, C, Y, and W135 are most common.

There are vaccines that contain capsular polysaccharide A, C, Y, or W135, either alone or conjugated to protein. Conjugate vaccines are preferable, because, unlike the polysaccharide vaccines, conjugate vaccines reduce the carriage of meningococci in the throat and thus its transmission, as well as confer a more sustained immune response, and, therefore, longer-term protection than the polysaccharide vaccines. Serogroup B vaccines are based upon meningococcal B protein antigens, because group B polysaccharide is poorly immunogenic in humans and is a potential auto-antigen. However, we are not told in the news reports above which serogroup or serogroups are involved in the Boy Scout Jamboree outbreak and what vaccines are being offered. More information in this regard would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.
