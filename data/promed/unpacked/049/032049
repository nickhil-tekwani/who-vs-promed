A parent brought a dead bat to Stevensville Elementary School earlier
this week, and school officials are encouraging any child who touched
the bat to get a series of rabies shots.

Stevensville Superintendent Kent Kultgen said the woman brought the
dead bat to school Monday [29 Sep 2008] morning and showed it to the
kindergarten and 5th-grade classmates of her children. She talked
about the bat and allowed students to touch the dead animal and gave
them hand sanitizer to wash their hands.

When school officials were notified, they called county and state
health officials, sent letters home with every student who may have
been exposed and sent the bat to a laboratory for testing. The bat
had rabies.

Rabies is a fatal neurological virus that can be spread through
saliva, usually through a bite. While the risk of contracting the
disease from the dead bat is low, Kultgen said the 80 students who
touched the bat are "strongly encouraged" to get the shots. Their
parents must give permission. "I believe that every parent is going
to say yes," Kultgen said. Kultgen says the school district's
insurance policy will cover the cost of the shots, which could be up
to USD 800 per student.

Another 10 or so children may have touched the bat at a club soccer
practice and were being urged to contact county health officials.
Kultgen said students will start getting the series of vaccines early
next week.

[The risk of contacting rabies from touching the dead bat is very low.
But the school is taking no chances, and likely the parents are not
taking chances either.

It is difficult to comprehend how someone could not think about
rabies when handling a bat. Although studying bats is quite
fascinating, one wonders where the dead bat came from and whether the
person bringing it into the school ever stopped to consider what
caused the death of the bat.

Readers are encouraged to read ProMED-mail post 20080826.2659
regarding a shortage of rabies post-exposure prophylaxis. The
indication for post-exposure vaccination with or without rabies immune
globulin depends on the type of contact with the rabid animal.
According the World Health Organization:
Types of contact are:
- Category I - touching or feeding animals, licks on the skin
- Category II - nibbling of uncovered skin, minor scratches or
abrasions without bleeding, licks on broken skin
- Category III - single or multiple transdermal bites or scratches,
contamination of mucous membrane with saliva from licks; exposure to
bat bites or scratches

For category I, no treatment is required, whereas for category II,
immediate vaccination and for category III immediate vaccination and
administration of rabies immune globulin are recommended in addition
to immediate washing and flushing of all bite wounds and scratches.
Depending on vaccine type, the post-exposure schedule prescribes
intramuscular doses of 1 ml or 0.5 ml given as 4 to 5 doses over 4
weeks. For rabies-exposed patients who have previously undergone
complete pre-exposure vaccination or post-exposure treatment with
cell-derived rabies vaccines, 2 intramuscular doses of a cell-derived
vaccine separated by 3 days are sufficient. Rabies immune globulin
treatment is not necessary in such cases. The same rules apply to
persons vaccinated against rabies who have demonstrated neutralizing
antibody titres of at least 0.5 IU/ml.

One dose of the vaccine should be administered on days 0, 3, 7, 14 &
30. All intramuscular injections must be given into the deltoid region
or, in small children, into the anterolateral area of the thigh
muscle. Vaccine should never be administered in the gluteal [buttock]
region.

Combined immunoglobulin-vaccine treatment was considered in the 8th
report of the WHO Expert Committee as the best specific systemic
treatment available at that time for the post-exposure prophylaxis of
rabies in humans, although experience indicated that vaccine alone
was sufficient for minor exposures (category II).

Treatment should be started as early as possible after exposure, but
in no case should it be denied to exposed persons whatever time
interval has elapsed.

Cost of post-exposure prophylaxis is approximately USD 800.
