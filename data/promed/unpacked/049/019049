In an update on the plague outbreak in Madagascar, the number of cases of the lethal bacterial infection has shot up to 449, an increase in 62 cases since our last report yesterday, [Mon 9 Oct 2017], according to the Ministere de la Publique. In addition, the death count has grown to 48.

A breakdown of the types of plague reported is as follows: Pneumonic or pulmonary plague (322), bubonic (123) and septicemic (1). A total of 3 other cases are classified as suspect as of today, [Tue 10 Oct 2017].

In the capital city of Antananarivo, 239 cases and 21 deaths have been reported. As many as 82 percent of cases in the city and surrounding suburbs are pneumonic plague. In Toamasina, 147 plague cases have been reported, including 9 deaths.

Pneumonic plague is probably the most serious form of plague; it's when the bacteria infect the lungs and causes pneumonia. It is contracted when the bacteria is inhaled (primary) or develops when bubonic or septicemic plague spreads to the lungs. Pneumonic plague is contagious and can be transmitted person to person. It is highly communicable under appropriate climate conditions, overcrowding and cool temperatures. Untreated pneumonic plague is frequently fatal.

Plague in Madagascar - Alert - Level 2, Practice Enhanced Precautions
---------------------------------------------------------------------

What is the current situation?
------------------------------
From [23 Aug 2017] through [10 Oct 2017], the WHO has reported 449 cases of plague in Madagascar; nearly 11 percent of those infected have died. Although bubonic plague occurs nearly every year in Madagascar, an unusual outbreak of plague pneumonia is occurring in geographically widespread areas, including in heavily populated cities of Antananarivo (the capital city and its suburbs) and Toamasina (the most affected districts and cities include Antananarivo, the capital city, and its suburbs, Toamasina, and the rural district of Faratsiho; cases have also been reported in Ambatondrazaka, Ambohidratrimo, Andramasina, Ankazobe, Anosibe An'ala, Anta-Atsimondrano, Anta-Avaradrano, Anta-Renivohitra, Arivonimamo, Faratsiho, Maevatanana, Mahajanga I, Miarinarivo, Moramanga, Toamasina I, Toamasina II, Tsiroanomandidy, Voh√©mar, and Ambalavao). New cases continue to be reported; as of [10 Oct 2017], 322 of the cases are plague pneumonia (which can be spread from person to person) and 123 are bubonic plague (which is spread through flea bites).

In response to the outbreak, the local government is working to control fleas and is canceling mass gatherings because plague pneumonia can be spread from person to person in close contact.

What is plague?
---------------
Plague is a bacterial infection that is usually spread through bites by infected fleas. When acquired by flea bite, plague has symptoms of high fever and swollen and tender lymph nodes (bubonic plague) that occur 2-6 days after the bite. If it is not treated, the infection can spread to the lungs and cause pneumonia. In rare but serious cases, a person with plague pneumonia can spread the infection directly to others by coughing the plague bacteria into the air (more information [link in the URL]). The current outbreak is unusual in that most cases are plague pneumonia. Plague can be treated with antibiotics; however, without prompt treatment, plague can cause serious illness or death.

How can travelers protect themselves?
-------------------------------------
Based on available information, the risk to travelers appears to be very low; however, travelers have been infected, and one died. Travelers to Madagascar should use insect repellent to prevent flea bites and avoid close contact with sick or dead animals. Travelers should also avoid close contact with ill people, especially those with cough or pneumonia.

No vaccine is available to prevent plague. Plague can be prevented with antimicrobials. Travelers who have had close contact with people with plague pneumonia or other high-risk exposures should immediately notify a health care provider. They may need to take antimicrobials to prevent plague. During or after travel to Madagascar, travelers should be alert for symptoms of plague, and if they appear, seek medical care and inform the provider about their travel to Madagascar.

[The rapid rise of cases with a predominance of pneumonic plague as well as infection in health care workers are both very worrisome.

It is frightening to monitor substantial outbreaks of infectious diseases in 2017. Although the specter of emerging zoonoses such as influenza H7N9 is worrisome (the pandemic clock is ticking, we just do not know what time it is), this year some of the old favorites are back on the front page:

- Plague in Madagascar with urban cases and a predominance of pneumonic involvement with large numbers relatively early in plague season on the island and at least one case exported to Seychelles;

- Cholera in horrific numbers in Yemen, already in almost 6 months approaching 6 years of cases in Haiti, occurring in not just drought or flooding but in the midst of overt military conflict;

- Hepatitis A in the USA, in southern California and eastern Michigan, occurring in substantial numbers not related to a contamination food but rather a product of unsanitary living conditions in homeless and illicit drug user population.

With global warming and climate change, continued warfare throughout the world, and the widening societal gaps in both the 1st and 3rd worlds, those of us involved in both public health and Public Health must remain ever vigilant to adapt our roles and change our paradigms to deal with these changes resulting in old and new pathogens. - Mod.LL
