3. This is how #Ebola spreads: An 8 yo boy whose mother died from Ebola in Beni was taken to his uncle in Mambasa. The boy developed Ebola & died from the infection. Mambasa hadn't previously had cases. Sigh (for the child & for the spread.)]

- Thu 11 Jul 2019. Health workers and hot spots
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/07/three-more-health-workers-infected-ebola-outbreak
[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

Three more health workers [have been] infected in the Ebola outbreak. The new cases raise the total number of healthcare workers infected in this outbreak to 131, including 41 deaths. Health workers make up 5% of all the victims of this outbreak, according to Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) data. The World Health Organization (WHO), however, in its latest Disease Outbreak News update, puts the number of infected health workers at 132.

The WHO also provided new epidemiologic details on infected health workers. "Of the 128 health workers with information available, the greatest proportion is among health workers at health posts [poste de sante] (20%, n = 26) and private health facilities (35%, n = 45). Three health workers -- 2 of them vaccinated -- are among the latest Ebola cases, according to yesterday's [10 Jul 2019] update from the ministry of health in the DRC.

"The health workers are from Beni, Katwa, and Kalunguta. The ministry of health said the unvaccinated worker was from Kalunguta and died in a community health center in that town. They are among 9 cases that DRC officials confirmed yesterday [10 Jul 2019]. The majority (68%, n = 87) of health worker infections were among nurses," the WHO said.

Today [11 Jul 2019] the DRC will likely confirm 14 more cases, raising the outbreak total to 2451 cases according to the WHO's Ebola dashboard.

Yesterday [10 Jul 2019] the DRC confirmed a new health zone, Mambasa, in Ituri province is affected, where a mother and her 8-year-old son died from the disease.

As of yesterday [10 Jul 2019], officials have confirmed a total of 1646 deaths and 358 suspected cases still under investigation.

Though transmission rates have remained steady throughout most of June and July [2019], the WHO noted that former hot spots are seeing a resurgence of cases.

"There has been an increase in cases in Beni, and a high incidence of cases continues in parts of Mabalako Health Zone," the WHO said. "In addition to these re-emerging hotspots, there are a large number of people with confirmed and probable infections moving to other health zones, with the greatest number coming from Beni Health Zone."

The re-emergence of Ebola in communities is likely due to a highly transient population, the WHO said, with infected people moving across North Kivu and Ituri provinces.

"The high rates of population movement from outbreak-affected areas to other areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and across porous borders to neighbouring countries during periods of heightened insecurity further compounds these risks," the WHO said.

Once again this week, Ebola experts have called for the WHO to readdress the designation of a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) for this outbreak. Ronald Klain, the US Ebola Czar during the West African Ebola outbreak in 2014 through 2016, and Daniel Lucey, MD, wrote in the Washington Post that a PHEIC would end the "global complacency" seen in this outbreak.

"In the absence of a trajectory toward extinguishing the outbreak, the opposite path -- severe escalation -- remains possible. The risk of the disease moving into nearby Goma, Congo -- a city of one million residents with an international [airport] -- or crossing into the massive refugee camps in South Sudan is mounting. With a limited number of vaccine doses remaining, either would be a catastrophe," they write.

WHO experts have declined 3 times this year [2019] to label the outbreak a PEHIC, largely because they argue doing so would do little to stop the outbreak but further cripple the DRC's already limited economy.

Klain and Lucey suggest that whether a PHEIC designate is "fair or unfair," it would ultimately increase preparedness activities in neighboring countries and encourage the USA to take a more active role in controlling the outbreak.

- Thu 11 Jul 2019. Emergencies preparedness, response
[WHO: Disease outbreak news: update, edited]
https://www.who.int/csr/don/11-july-2019-ebola-drc/en/

The outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) continues this past week with a similar transmission intensity to the previous week. While the number of new cases continues to ease in former hotspots, such as Butembo, Katwa and Mandima health zones, there has been an increase in cases in Beni, and a high incidence of cases continues in parts of Mabalako Health Zone. In addition to these re-emerging hotspots, there are a large number of people with confirmed and probable infections moving to other health zones, with the greatest number coming from Beni Health Zone. The movement of cases causes the outbreak to spread to new health zones and re-emerge in health zones with previously controlled infections. Overall, this underscores the importance of robust mechanisms for listing and following up contacts and understanding the motivations for peoples' decisions to move.

After the 1st reported case in the Ariwara Health Zone on 30 Jun [2019], no new cases have been observed in that health zone. A response team deployed to that zone continues to identify contacts, engage the community, and vaccinate individuals at risk. Response personnel from the bordering countries of Uganda and South Sudan continue to support operational readiness activities. Resources are being dedicated to monitoring the Uganda-DRC border in that area.

In the 21 days from 19 Jun through 9 Jul 2019, 72 health areas within 22 health zones reported new cases, representing 11% of the 664 health areas within North Kivu and Ituri provinces (see Figure 2 at the source URL). During this period, a total of 247 confirmed cases were reported, the majority of which were from the health zones of Beni (41%, n = 101), Mabalako (19%, n = 48), Lubero (6%, n = 16), and Mandima (5%, n = 13). As of 9 Jul 2019, a total of 2437 EVD cases, including 2343 confirmed and 94 probable cases, were reported (see Table 1 at the source URL). A total of 1646 deaths were reported (overall case fatality ratio, 68%), including 1552 deaths among confirmed cases. Of the 2437 confirmed and probable cases with known age and sex, 57% (1384) were female, and 29% (704) were children aged less than 18 years.

Cases continue to increase among health workers, with the cumulative number infected rising to 132 (5% of total cases). Of the 128 health workers with information available, the greatest proportion is among health workers at health posts [poste de sante] (20%, n = 26) and private health facilities (35%, n = 45). The majority (68%, n = 87) of health worker infections were among nurses.

No new EVD cases or deaths have been reported in the Republic of Uganda since the previous EVD Disease Outbreak News publication on 13 Jun 2019. As of 3 Jul [2019], 108 contacts exposed to those cases were identified, and they all completed the 21-day follow-up period. All contacts were asymptomatic. Arua district, located in the northwestern part of Uganda near the Uganda-DRC border, is currently stepping up its response readiness to prevent imported cases of Ebola following the case that died on 30 Jun 2019 in Ariwara Health Zone in neighbouring DRC, located 8 km (about 5 mi) from the Uganda border. This case is known to have over 200 contacts, some of whom are in the communities bordering the Arua district. As of 9 Jul 2019, 2 suspected cases in the Arua district were reported and both tested negative. As of 9 Jul 2019, the cumulative number of individuals vaccinated in Arua district is 811 of 1092 targeted front-line and healthcare workers.

- Thu 11 Jul 2019. Interview with David Gressly
[The New Humanitarian, abridged, edited]
https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/interview/2019/07/11/congo-ebola-outbreak-public-health-response
[Byline: Vittoria Elliott]

Appointed as UN Emergency Ebola Response Coordinator in May [2019], David Gressly is the man responsible for getting on top of the crisis. He is advocating a structured approach to fighting the disease, in order to focus on what is "stopping the public health response from happening."

Since Ebola was declared in August last year [2018], 1641 people have died in what is the world's 2nd-worst outbreak of the disease, in a region with an ongoing insurgent conflict.

Many of those deaths have been hidden away in private homes or in general healthcare centres. There are "significant numbers" of new confirmed cases that are unable to be traced to an existing Ebola contact, Medecins Sans Frontieres warned this month [July 2019].

A number of factors have made this outbreak particularly difficult to contain, triggering fears of its spread across the country's porous borders. There remains deep community skepticism in eastern Congo -- an opposition stronghold -- over the origin of the disease. Most people do not question the existence of Ebola, but ask why it continues to spread. There is also wide-ranging suspicion of the Ebola response itself, with the influx of foreign aid and health workers seen as profit-driven.

In the climate of mistrust -- fueled by rumour and misinformation -- there have been more than 74 attacks on Ebola clinics or health workers since January [2019]. Community alienation has been reinforced by the use of the security forces to compel people to comply with health measures.

Gressly is the point man on the international response to Ebola. Prior to his appointment, he was the deputy head of the UN peacekeeping mission in the DRC, known as MONUSCO. That security experience is proving valuable in a region where more than 100 armed groups operate, and each treatment interruption allows the virus to circulate.

In a 2-part interview -- via phone and e-mail -- he spoke to The New Humanitarian about the challenge of working in a region that has suffered 2 decades of armed conflict; where the humanitarian needs of communities extend well beyond this health crisis; and on the urgency of developing a "partner-wide" strategy to end the outbreak.

This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

- What are the top things you'd like to change now that you've been on the ground for a few weeks?

"Number one is to bring all of the partners in the response together ... Secondly, there are areas where surveillance is weak, mainly because of insecurity. ... What's important is to take a more structured approach that looks at the things that are stopping the public health response from happening.

"So we are building in multiple layers of support to the response. We are looking at the political side in terms of engagement with the government and with armed groups, hopefully supporting any kind of dialogue between them. We're looking at how to better secure areas without militarisation. We're very much interested in creating more of an area-wide security that benefits not just the responders, but the community at large, which can include community policing.

"But most importantly is a much deeper engagement with communities, both in currently affected areas and in at-risk areas, so that we provide a broader range of support that is not just Ebola-centric. And so we can build up a level of understanding of their concerns. Hopefully, trust will come with that so that we can work more effectively on the ground."

- You also have extensive experience in peacekeeping operations. What can MONUSCO do to better protect local responders on the ground?

"[MONUSCO is] quite co-operative and are supporting "area security", which normally would be a form of patrols going out, not as escorts, but in advance [of a response team] or in a general area to provide a general sense of security. They can also deploy locally to be in the area, to be available if there's an incident, to respond quickly. [The peacekeepers] can also be used as an interposition between militia forces and national forces where that may be required, where we're just trying to find a neutral space for the response to take place.

"We use community policing for more urban areas as a way to provide security to the community as a whole, as opposed to just focusing on responders. But having that broader security umbrella that protects the community will protect the responders. The community policing, in this sense, would be setting up joint operations centres between the [UN] mission police and the national police, as well as quick reaction teams with joint patrols, particularly at night.

"There is also a hotline for the community to call. In other areas where this has been done it has really reduced the rate of criminality significantly. And I think we'll see the same thing when we apply this in places like Butembo [an Ebola epicentre]. So it has a double impact on improving security for the population, while also serving as a deterrent that helps protect those who are providing the response."

- Are you concerned over associating peacekeepers with the response?

"Our primary purpose is that everyone can work in a safe operating environment. To achieve that, we are promoting an area security approach, which does not rely on always-present armed protection. Armed personnel can have a detrimental effect on responders' work and the vast majority of the response is conducted without an armed presence.

"You can have security forces operating in an area without directly escorting or directly protecting [responders], and still create a security umbrella in which they can work safely and securely.

"So you can de-link the 2 while still providing the security required. I'm not too worried about that part. It's a question of better targeting where it needs to be done; not just in the hotspots, which has been the focus in the past.

"However, as the attack on responders in Beni [in June 2019] highlighted, the threat of physical danger to the responders exists. We use armed escorts as a last resort.

"As we step up our engagement with communities, including by listening to their needs beyond Ebola and finding ways to meet them, we are seeing some of the reticence to the response ease. This will take time in some areas that have historically been distrustful of outsiders. We are making progress, but need to do more.

"The virus will find a way to continue to replicate if we don't have all the holes plugged."

- What can be done to try to stop the outbreak infecting so many children?

"Ebola hits children in ways that are very different from adults. Children orphaned by Ebola also need sustained support. They need to be protected from stigma and discrimination. They need help reintegrating into their communities -- especially at school. UNICEF, through partners in the community, has been able to provide every child known to us who has been orphaned or separated from their parents due to Ebola with psychosocial support, care and love -- notably from women who are themselves Ebola survivors."

Characterisation of infectious Ebola virus from the ongoing outbreak to guide response activities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo: a phylogenetic and in vitro analysis. Lancet Infect Dis 2019 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(19)30291-9.

Background: The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of candidate therapies and diagnostic tests with the outbreak strain Ituri Ebola virus. Lacking a virus isolate from this outbreak, a recombinant Ituri Ebola virus was compared with a similarly engineered Makona virus from the 2013-16 outbreak.

Methods: Using Ebola virus sequences provided by organisations in DR Congo and a reverse genetics system, we generated an authentic Ebola virus from the ongoing outbreak in Ituri and North Kivu provinces. To relate this virus to other Ebola viruses in DR Congo, we did a phylogenetic analysis of representative complete Ebola virus genome sequences from previous outbreaks. We evaluated experimental therapies being tested in clinical trials in DR Congo, including remdesivir and ZMapp monoclonal antibodies, for their ability to inhibit the growth of infectious Ituri Ebola virus in cell culture. We also tested diagnostic assays for detection of the Ituri Ebola virus sequence.

Findings: The phylogenetic analysis of whole-genome sequences from each Ebola virus outbreak suggests there are at least 2 Ebola virus strains in DR Congo, which have independently crossed into the human population. The Ituri Ebola strain initially grew slower than the Makona strain, yet reached similar mean yields of 3 [times] 10(7) 50% tissue culture infectious dose by 72 h infection in Huh-7 cells. Ituri Ebola virus was similar to Makona in its susceptibility to inhibition by remdesivir and to neutralisation by monoclonal antibodies from ZMapp and other monoclonal antibodies. Remdesivir inhibited Ituri Ebola virus at a 50% effective concentration (EC50) of 12 nM (with a selectivity index of 303) and Makona Ebola virus at 13 nM (with a selectivity index of 279). The ZMapp monoclonal antibodies 2G4 and 4G7 neutralised Ituri Ebola virus with a mean EC50 of 0.24 microgram/mL and 0.48 microgram/mL, and Makona Ebola virus with a mean EC50 of 0.45 microgram/mL and 0.2 microgram/mL. The Xpert Ebola and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention real-time RT-qPCR diagnostic assays detected Ituri and Makona Ebola virus sequences with similar sensitivities and efficiencies, despite primer site binding mismatches in the Ituri Ebola virus.

In The Lancet Infectious Diseases, Laura K. McMullan and colleagues present the 1st occasion in which reverse genetics technology has been used to generate an Ebola virus isolate using sequence information from an ongoing filovirus outbreak where isolates were not readily available. The engineered isolate contains a fluorescent reporter protein (Zoanthus green fluorescent protein) that allows virus growth to be quantified by measuring fluorescence in infected cells. McMullan and colleagues assessed the efficacy of investigational therapies against Ebola virus disease and the sensitivity of diagnostic assays approved for emergency use in the 2018 outbreak. Importantly, the authors showed that investigational therapies being tested in clinical trials in DR Congo (including remdesivir and ZMapp monoclonal antibodies) are effective against viruses known to be circulating in the outbreak. The Ebola diagnostic assays approved for emergency use by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and WHO detected Ituri Ebola virus with high sensitivity despite primer site binding mismatches.

Efficacy [of countermeasures] is dependent on the availability of information about the exact virus isolate responsible for the outbreak. Although heroic efforts have been made by Congolese scientists and those with the Institut National de Recherche Biomedicale (Kinshasa, DR Congo) and US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (Fort Detrick, MD) to ensure sequence information is available to the scientific community, only predictive inferences can be made about the efficacy of any medical countermeasure used in the current outbreak.

The findings by McMullan and colleagues support the continued testing of investigational therapies against Ebola virus disease in the ongoing outbreak, and have renewed confidence in the Ebola assays approved for emergency use. Further work is needed to characterise host responses to infection with this engineered Ebola isolate compared with other Ebola isolates. In vivo verification of antiviral and vaccine candidate efficacy is of equal importance to strengthen global confidence in new medical countermeasures and make the necessary refinements.

- Tue 9 Jul 2019. Synthetic Ebola virus
[STAT News, edited]
https://www.statnews.com/2019/07/09/lacking-ebola-samples-cdc-made-a-synthetic-virus-to-test-treatments-it-worked/
[Byline: Helen Branswell]

Scientists at the Centers from Disease Control and Prevention have created a synthetic version of the Ebola virus circulating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), part of an effort to determine whether diagnostic tests and experimental treatments being used in the field are effective.

The research, conducted in the agency's most secure laboratories -- BSL4 -- showed that even though the tests and 2 of the treatments being used in the field were developed based on earlier variation of Ebola viruses, they continue to be effective against the virus causing the current outbreak, the 2nd largest on record.

The results, reported [Tue 9 Jul 2019] in the journal The Lancet Infectious Diseases, are encouraging, but also raise questions about why outside research groups have not received direct access to viral specimens from the DRC and instead had to create a synthetic version. The paper noted that there have been no Ebola samples available to the scientific community from the past 4 outbreaks in the DRC. Those outbreaks occurred in 2014, 2017, and 2018.

The current one, which has involved more than 2400 cases and 1600 deaths, began last summer [August 2018]. Ebola scientists who were not involved in the work praised the CDC's effort, saying it is important to test the tools being used against the virus in the outbreak. But they noted it would be easier, faster, and potentially more accurate to use actual viruses rather than those re-created from genetic codes logged in an online database.

"I don't know anyone who has isolates from this outbreak," said Tom Geisbert, of the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. "They did a great job here in a short period of time, but man, that takes a lot of resources and a lot of money and a lot of energy to make a cloned virus by reverse genetics. And it would be so much easier if somebody had just sent the isolate."

Gary Kobinger, who led the work to develop the Ebola treatment ZMapp -- one of the therapies the CDC group tested against the synthesized virus -- said it is becoming increasingly difficult to get pathogens to study. It's a global trend, he said, and one that threatens the world's ability to conduct surveillance and develop diagnostic tests for disease-causing pathogens.

"A lot of the science that is benefiting them, including diagnostics, is because previous isolates were shared," Kobinger, who is director of the Infectious Disease Research Center at Laval University in Quebec, said of the DRC.

He noted that during the West African outbreak of 2014-2016, Guinea quickly agreed to share virus samples. The Canadian national laboratory, where Kobinger worked at the time and where the Ebola vaccine currently deployed in the DRC was developed, used the virus samples to test whether the vaccine should protect against the viruses causing that outbreak. It did.

Laura McMullan, the lead author of the CDC study, was uncertain if the agency had asked for virus samples from this outbreak. Pressed for a more precise answer, the CDC said the agency has on several occasions offered to assist DRC's National Biomedical Research Institute with specimen analysis, virus sequencing, and diagnostic support. INRB, as the lab is known, has not asked for help.

"These things are tricky," said McMullan, who is a research scientist with the CDC's viral special pathogens branch, said of the processes involved in sharing viral samples. "To get material out ... you've got to have someone who's willing to ship, you've got to have the appropriate cold chain [equipment]. So it's often a logistical issue. And you have to have permission and everyone working together."

A spokeswoman for the DRC health ministry, Jessica Ilunga, said she would look into the country's policy on sharing of viruses from this outbreak.

McMullan noted that high-quality sequence data generated by INRB and by scientists from the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases working with the national lab has been posted online. Access to that data enabled the CDC team to re-create the virus.

- Fri 12 Jul 2019. Congo rules out using additional trial vaccines to combat Ebola
[Reuters, edited]
https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-health-ebola-congo/congo-rules-out-using-additional-trial-vaccines-to-combat-ebola-idUKKCN1U71KX?rpc=401&
[Byline: Anna Pujol-Mazzini]

Congo will not permit the use of further experimental vaccines as it combats an Ebola outbreak because doing so risked "confusing the population," the government said on Friday [12 Jul 2019].

Health workers have vaccinated more than 130 000 people during the nearly year-long epidemic in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo with an experimental vaccine manufactured by Merck that has proven highly effective.

But the outbreak, which is the 2nd worst in history, continues to spread, due largely to mistrust by people in eastern Congo of the response and armed attacks against health workers that have limited access to patients.

"Due to a lack of sufficient scientific evidence on the efficacy and safety of other vaccines, and the risk of confusing the population, it was decided that no clinical trial of vaccines will be authorized ... during the current Ebola outbreak," the health ministry said in a daily bulletin.

But the government did not rule out using other vaccines in the future, "once their efficacy has been proven," a government directive to health workers said on Wednesday [10 Jul 2019].

In May [2019] experts advising the World Health Organization recommended that other vaccines be introduced to help ensure that vaccine supplies last and specifically mentioned a new experimental vaccine manufactured by Johnson & Johnson.

"There are legitimate concerns that the stock of the Merck vaccine is not sufficient to sustain any increased flow of supply for more than a few months, and there is unfortunately no guarantee that this epidemic will be controlled by then," Natalie Roberts, Medecins Sans Frontieres' operations manager, told Reuters.

The Congolese government said there were currently no issues with the supply of the Merck vaccine.

Misinformation propagated by some community leaders in eastern Congo has led people to refuse vaccinations or treatment, and the government fears using a 2nd vaccine would stoke further conspiracy theories.

More than 2400 cases confirmed and probable cases have been registered since the outbreak was declared last August [2018], including over 1600 deaths.
