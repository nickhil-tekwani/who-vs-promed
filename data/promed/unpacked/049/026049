1st report of Bean common mosaic potyvirus in Western Australia
-----------------------------------------------
M. Saqib,WA State Agricultural Biotechnology Centre, School of Biological
Sciences and Biotechnology, Murdoch University, Perth, WA 6150, Australia;

Western Australia, Locked Bag No. 4, Bentley Delivery Centre, Perth, WA
6983, Australia; B. Cayford (as for Saqib); and M. G. K Jones,

Bean common mosaic virus (BCMV; Family _Potyviridae_, genus _Potyvirus_)
infects _Phaseolus vulgaris_ crops in many regions of the world. It is
transmitted in a non-persistent manner by aphids and is also readily
seed-transmitted (Hongying et al., 2002).

The disease it causes decreases crop production. In Australia, BCMV has
been reported in New South Wales, Queensland, Tasmania and Victoria, based
on serology and amino acid composition (Moghal & Francki, 1976; 1981).
However, there is no information about isolates or its origin, and no
further confirmation or any sequence data for BCMV from Australia. It has
not been reported in the Northern Territory, South Australia or Western
Australia.

In July 2004, at Kununurra in the east Kimberly region of Western
Australia, _P. vulgaris_ plants with mottle and leaf deformation, severe
mosaic, malformation of leaves and pods, downward curling of leaves and
reduction in leaf size were observed in the field. Extracts of symptomatic
leaf samples tested positive with generic potyvirus monoclonal antibody in
ELISA and infected _Chenopodium quinoa_, _C. amaranticolor_ and _Nicotiana
benthamiana_ when manually inoculated.

For molecular identification, total RNA was isolated from symptomatic leaf
tissues using an RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). The RNA samples were
tested using RT-PCR and generic potyvirus specific primers that amplify a
1700 bp fragment from the 3' end of the genome [5'GTTTTCCCAGTCACGA C(T)15;
5' GGNAAYAAYAGYGGNCARCC] (Chen et al., 2001). A portion of the PCR product
(482 bp) was sequenced at the 3' end (Acc. No. AY850005) and the data
compared against other BCMV sequences in GenBank. The isolate shared 97
percent nucleotide identity with the 'NL1' and 'Type' strains of BCMV (Acc.
Nos AY112735 and U55319).

This sequence result provides the 1st reliable confirmation of BCMV in
Australia and is the 1st report of its occurrence in Western Australia.

[BCMV almost certainly entered Western Australia via infected seed. Its
seedborne nature guarantees its spread, and infected seedlings are sources
of virus inoculum. Many BCMV strains have been distinguished (Drijfhout et
al., 1978). Those once grouped as serotype A are now considered isolates of
a separate potyvirus species -- Bean common necrosis virus -- and several
viruses, once considered to be distinct, have now been shown to be strains
of this virus (McKern et al., 1992). The latter include: azuki bean mosaic
virus, blackeye cowpea mosaic virus, cowpea (aphid-borne) mosaic virus,
cowpea (blackeye) mosaic virus, cowpea vein-banding mosaic virus, peanut
blotch virus, peanut stripe virus and some isolates from soybean. Genetic
studies using F2 populations of _P. vulgaris_ from crosses between
differential cultivars of _P. vulgaris_ and novel isolates of BCMV and Bean
common mosaic necrosis virus (BCMNV) from Africa have revealed that there
are previously undescribed resistance genes in _P. vulgaris_. These genes
are currently under investigation using other novel isolates of BCMV and
BCMNV. The primary aim of research on the molecular genetics of legume
viruses is for the genetic improvement of _Phaseolus vulgaris_ in Africa
for resistance to viruses. Disease management is basically planting of
virus-free seed.
