"Camelpox occurs in almost every country in which camel husbandry is practised apart from the introduced dromedary camel in Australia and tylopods (llama and related species) in South America. Outbreaks have been reported in the Middle East (Bahrain, Iran, Iraq, Oman, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen), in Asia (Afghanistan and Pakistan), in Africa (Algeria, Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Somalia, and Sudan) and in the southern parts of Russia and India. The disease is endemic in these countries and a pattern of sporadic outbreaks occurs with a rise in the seasonal incidence usually during the rainy season."

"The camelpox virus belongs to the family Poxviridae, subfamily Chordopoxvirinae, genus _Orthopoxvirus_. The disease is characterised by fever, local or generalised pox lesions on the skin and in the mucous membranes of the mouth and respiratory tract. The clinical manifestations range from inapparent infection to mild, moderate and, less commonly, severe systemic infection and death. The disease occurs more frequently and more severely in young animals and pregnant females. Transmission is by either direct contact between infected and susceptible animals or indirect infection via a contaminated environment. The role of insects in transmission has been suspected because the disease is often observed after rainfall. Camelpox virus is very host specific and does not infect other animals. Zoonotic camelpox virus infection in humans associated with outbreaks in dromedary camels (_Camelus dromedaries_) was described in the north-eastern region of India during 2009. This was a single incident illustrating that camelpox is of limited public health importance."

In the current report the species of camel affected is not provided. Kazakhstan has both species of domestic camels (dromedary and Bactrian) as well as hybrids of these.

The following abstract comes from the article entitled, "The distribution of the two domestic camel species in Kazakhstan caused by the demand of industrial stockbreeding" by Imamura K, Salmurzauli R, Iklasoc MK, et al, published in the Journal of Arid Land Studies, 2017 (https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jals/26/4/26_233/_pdf and https://doi.org/10.14976/jals.26.4_233)

Abstract
--------
"There are 2 domestic camel species: the dromedary and the Bactrian camel. The distribution of the 2 domestic camel species is clearly differing, although they meet at the latitude corresponding to an average temperature of around 21 deg C [around 70 deg F]. The Bactrian occurs in the eastern area of Afro-Eurasia continent; from Mongolia to Central Asia. While, the dromedary inhabits western area; from the Arabian Peninsula to the Sahara Desert. In Kazakhstan, they keep both species and hybrid of them. The dromedary is dominant in eastern Kazakhstan, around Almaty; and the Bactrian is prevalent in the north-western part, around Aktobe. In our study, we found that nowadays, the geographic distribution of both camel species is greatly determined by climatic factors; for instance, the one-humped camel could be breed in environment where the annual average air temperature is above 10 deg C [50 deg F] and the record low air temperature dips minus 38 deg C [minus 36.4 deg F] or above. It is difficult to keep one-humped camels in the northern region to the 45degN altitude. Also, economic demand is an important factor for the geographic distribution of both camel species. Nowadays, the dromedary is dominant especially in Almaty region despite its severe climatic conditions, because [on one side] Almaty is a large economic center in Kazakhstan and [on the other], the dromedary produces much more milk than the Bactrian camel."
