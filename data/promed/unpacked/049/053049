Speaking at a press briefing in Lagos, the Customs boss explained that the world is wary of monkeypox whose mode of transmission includes clothing. Ejibunu also pointed out that smuggling of used clothes has economic and health implications on Nigerians.

What Customs Controller said: Customs made a massive discovery of 1955 bales of used clothing in an abandoned building around the Lagos International Trade Fair Complex. "We made the discovery and evacuation using combined strategies of intelligence, tact, and enforcement."

He also noted that serious health implication associated with the use of such clothing exposes users to skin diseases like scabies, as well as fungal diseases which can be transmitted by wearing unwashed 2nd-hand clothes.

It is illegal to import used clothes for resale: Used clothing in commercial quantity falls under absolute prohibition. They have been seized and we are on the trail of the smugglers to get them arrested.

According to him: "The very serious health implication of this act of textile smuggling is exposure of users to skin diseases like scabies and fungal diseases which can be transmitted by wearing unwashed second-hand clothes.

"Monkeypox is a viral zoonotic disease that occurs primarily in tropical rainforest areas of central and West Africa and is occasionally exported to other regions.

"The government in its wisdom wants the local textile industry to enjoy protection and create more jobs for Nigerians from the cotton farms through the textile and garment factories to our markets," he noted.

About monkeypox: According to a World Health Organization fact sheet, monkeypox is transmitted to humans through close contact with an infected person or animal, or with material contaminated with the virus.

Monkeypox virus is transmitted from one person to another by close contact with lesions, body fluids, respiratory droplets and contaminated materials such as bedding.

[The risk of transmission of monkeypox virus from imported clothing appears to be extremely unlikely but not impossible. The virus is already endemic in Nigeria and local transmission from infected animals or other Nigerians is the far greater risk. The prohibition of importation of used clothing appears to be driven by economic concerns. - Mod.TY]

Abstract
--------
A global monkeypox outbreak began in May 2022. Limited data exist on specimen type performance in associated molecular diagnostics. Consequently, a diverse range of specimen sources were collected in the initial weeks of the outbreak in Ontario, Canada. Our clinical evaluation identified skin lesions as the optimal diagnostic specimen source.

The rapid emergence of monkeypox in nonendemic regions of the world during 2022 has health systems on alert (1). Monkeypox is a zoonosis caused by monkeypox virus (MPXV) (genus _Orthopoxvirus_ [OPXV]). MPXV forms 2 distinct clades: clade I (formerly the Congo Basin/Central African clade), associated with higher virulence and greater mortality rate, and clade II (formerly the West African clade), which is responsible for the current global outbreak (2,3).

The rapid increase in monkeypox cases in nonendemic areas has challenged clinical laboratories. MPXV shedding and transmission are poorly understood, and relevant data to support clinical management and public health response are lacking. Human-to-human transmission occurs by respiratory droplets, direct contact with skin lesions of infected persons, or contact with contaminated fomites (4). Skin lesions, when present, are presumed to be the primary source of viral shedding. Thus, testing of lesion swab specimens by real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) is believed to be optimal for diagnosis (5,6). MPXV can also be detected in other sites, such as throat, nasopharynx, blood, urine, saliva, and semen (7).

We investigated detection of MPXV among different clinical specimen types. These specimens were submitted to the provincial reference laboratory for testing in the early weeks of the 2022 outbreak in Ontario, Canada.

The study
---------
The Public Health Ontario Ethics Review Board determined that this study did not require research ethics committee approval because it describes analyses that were completed at the Public Health Ontario laboratory as part of routine clinical testing and surveillance during the monkeypox outbreak in Ontario. Therefore, this study was considered to be public health practice and was exempt from this requirement.

This retrospective study was conducted on patient specimens submitted to Public Health Ontario's laboratory, the reference microbiology laboratory in Ontario and MPXV testing location, during the initial weeks of the provincial surge (Mayâ'June 2022). All specimens were collected from symptomatic patients with suspected monkeypox infection. Specimen types were categorized as blood, skin lesions, nasal or nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens, and oropharyngeal (throat) swab specimens. Urine, semen, and saliva were infrequently submitted. We extracted clinical data submitted on the laboratory requisition, including demographic variables, clinical information, and enterovirus laboratory test results if available.

We extracted DNA from clinical specimens using either the automated total nucleic acid method (NucliSENS easyMAG; bioMérieux; https://www.biomerieux.com) or the manual method (QIAamp DNA Minikit; QIAGEN; https://www.qiagen.com). We conducted testing by using 1 of 2 assays developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): the Laboratory Response Network pan-Orthopoxvirus (OPX) RT-PCR and an MPXV-specific RT-PCR endorsed by the World Health Organization (8-10). Both assays were validated in-house for clinical testing. The OPXV assay primer/probe set was supplied by CDC for restricted use through the Canadian Laboratory Response Network. The MPXV RT-PCR consists of a generic MPXV GR2-G target (MPX), an MPXV clade II-specific target, and an RNaseP extraction control.

Using the QuantStudio5 RT-PCR system and TaqPath ProAmp Multiplex master mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific; https://www.thermofisher.com), we amplified a 10-μL reaction containing 4 μL DNA, 0.5 μmol/L primers, and 0.2 μmol/L probe. Thermocycling conditions were 60 deg C [140 deg F] for 30 s, 95 deg C [203 deg F] for 5 min, and 45 cycles at 95 deg C for 5 s and 60 deg C for 30 s. Cycle threshold (Ct) values ≤38 was reported as detected, 38.01-39.99 as indeterminate, and ≥40 as not detected for MPXV DNA (11).

The testing algorithm shifted from the OPXV RT-PCR to the MPXV RT-PCR once the MPXV assay was validated. Some specimens were tested by both assays during validation. RT-PCR results, including Ct values, were evaluated by specimen type among patients who had multiple specimens collected during the same testing episode. Parallel testing for enterovirus by RT-PCR was conducted for pediatric (age <18 years) patients as the most likely differential diagnosis in this age group and for adults (age >18 years) upon request.

We tested 1063 specimens from 372 patients (mean age 33.8 years, range >1-88 years); 71.2% were male. MPXV was detected in 81 (21.8%) patients, all adult males who had a mean age of 38 years (range 19-65 years). Specimen positivity rate was 23.4% (249/1063); 2.8% (29/1063) of all specimens tested had indeterminate results.

Among specimens submitted from the 81 MPXV-positive patients, skin lesions displayed the highest positivity rate (177/213, 83.1%), followed by oropharyngeal (31/46, 67.4%), nasal or NP (20/36, 55.6%), blood (29/67, 43.3%) and urine (6/21, 28.6%) (Table). MPXV was also detected in 2/5 semen specimens and 1/1 saliva specimen submitted from known MPXV-positive patients.

Across all positive specimens, the MPXV GR2-G target mean Ct (26.2) was 2.7 lower than that of the OPXV assay (29.9), and the clade II target mean Ct (26.3) was 2.6 times lower. The MPXV assay also had lower Ct values than the OPXV assay across all specimen types (Table), indicating higher analytical sensitivity. Skin lesion specimens were detected multiple cycles earlier, indicative of higher viral loads. Oropharyngeal samples had the 2nd lowest Ct means.

Among 78 monkeypox confirmed case-patients with skin and NP or throat swab specimens submitted for testing, 72/78 (92.3%) had ≥1 positive skin specimen and 38/78 (48.7%) had ≥1 positive NP or throat swab specimens. MPXV was only detected in skin specimens in 34/78 (43.6%) patients. All patients with a positive blood specimen had >1 other positive specimen type. Among 15 monkeypox confirmed case-patients who had both NP and throat swab specimens submitted, 8 had concordant (53.3%) positive and 2 (13.3%) had concordant negative results. One case-patient had a negative NP swab and positive throat swab specimens, and 4 discordant case-patients had 1 sample type indeterminate and the other negative.

Enterovirus was detected in 25 (71.4%) of the 35 children tested. It was also detected in 7 (46.7%) of the 15 adults tested.

[5] Neonatal infection

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The ongoing monkeypox outbreak was recently declared to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization.(1) Young children are at risk for severe disease; therefore, early recognition and prompt treatment are important.

We report a case of perinatally acquired monkeypox virus infection and adenovirus coinfection in a 10-day-old infant. After the infant's uneventful birth in late April 2022, a rash developed on day 9 of life. The rash was initially vesicular, starting on the palms and soles and subsequently spreading to the face and trunk, and gradually became pustular (Figure 1). 9 days before the birth, the infant's father had had a febrile illness, followed by a widespread rash; the rash resolved before the infant's birth. Then 4 days after the infant's delivery, a similar rash developed in the mother. The family lived in the United Kingdom, and there was no history of travel to Africa or of contact with any travelers.

The infant was transferred to the regional pediatric intensive care unit on day 15 of life owing to evolving hypoxemic respiratory failure (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at https://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMc2210828/suppl_file/nejmc2210828_appendix.pdf). A number of diagnoses (neonatal varicella, herpes simplex virus infection, coxsackievirus or enterovirus infection, staphylococcal skin infection, scabies, syphilis, and gonorrhea) were considered. The presence of axillary lymphadenopathy, the nature of the skin lesions, and the atypical timeline of intrafamilial infection aroused concern regarding human monkeypox. Polymerase-chain-reaction testing of blood, urine, vesicular-fluid, and throat-swab samples obtained from the infant and mother led to a diagnosis of monkeypox virus infection (clade IIb). Adenovirus was also identified in the infant's respiratory secretions and blood. The infant's condition worsened, and invasive ventilation was initiated. A 2-week course of enteral tecovirimat (at a dose of 50 mg twice a day) was commenced in combination with intravenous cidofovir. After 4 weeks in intensive care, including 14 days of invasive ventilation, the infant recovered and was discharged home. The timeline of intrafamilial infection and test results is shown in Figure S2.

Reports of neonatal monkeypox virus infection are rare.(3) This was a case of neonatal monkeypox virus infection after peripartum transmission within a family cluster; transplacental transmission could not be ruled out.(4) Because this was a single case, it is not possible to attribute the clinical illness to either pathogen (monkeypox virus or adenovirus) directly, nor is it possible to attribute the improvement in the infant's clinical condition to the use of tecovirimat or cidofovir.(5) Monkeypox virus infection should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a neonatal vesicular rash.
