[1] UK (Scotland), mute swan: H5N1 confirmed

Tests have shown a wild Mute swan found dead in a Scottish coastal town had
the lethal H5N1 strain of bird flu -- Britain's 1st case of the disease, a
British farmers' group said on Thursday.
"The highly pathogenic H5N1 strain of avian influenza has now been
confirmed in the dead swan," the National Farmers' Union (NFU) said in a
statement on its web site. An NFU spokeswoman said the union had been given
the information by British authorities.
The Scottish Department of Environment and chief veterinary officer could
not confirm that the swan, found last week in Cellardyke harbour, had the
deadly flu strain, but they promised an announcement imminently.
The discovery in the swan of the highly pathogenic strain blamed for 108
human deaths elsewhere since 2003 would make Britain the 14th country in
the European Union to find the disease on its territory.
Amid a media frenzy over the discovery of H5N1 in Britain, government and
officials tried to calm the public's concerns about the risk of
transmission of the disease to humans.
"There is a better chance of a person winning the national lottery than
catching bird flu in the U.K. today," Dr. Jim Robertson from the National
Institute for Biological Standards and Control said.[Sky TV used a less
attractive example: being struck by lightning. - Mod.AS].
"This is an unwelcome and important development from the point of view of
poultry health, but there are no implications either for human health or
consumers," the NFU said.
Scotland's chief veterinary officer Charles Milne said it was not known
whether the swan was from a local or migratory flock.
The partially eaten carcass of the swan was found in Fife, eastern
Scotland, late on 29 Mar 2006 and sent to a laboratory in Weybridge,
southern England, for analysis on 31 Mar 2006, he added.
Milne said there was no indication of infections in domestic poultry, and
no reason to believe the carcass had been partially eaten by a domestic animal.
Officials have set up a 3-km (1.8-mile) protection zone around where the
swan was found. Owners of birds within the zone have been told to take them
indoors. A further 10-km surveillance zone is in force.
Government officials reviewed bird flu contingency plans at a London
meeting on Thursday and concluded that "all relevant steps are being taken."
Bird flu remains essentially an animal disease, but can infect people who
come into direct contact with infected birds. Milne said properly prepared
poultry and poultry products were entirely safe for human consumption.
Bob McCracken, past president of the British Veterinary Association, said
that contact between wild birds that may be infected and poultry should be
kept to a minimum.[See comment].
"We also have to work on the assumption that there is some spread among
wild birds ... There is no doubt we are getting closer to the day when
moving birds indoors will be necessary," he said.
Scientists said they were confident that surveillance for possible cases of
the disease was good enough.

[2] UK (Scotland), mute swan: H5N1 confirmed

Joint statement from the UK and Scottish Chief Veterinary Officers:
H5n1 avian flu confirmed in dead wild bird in Scotland
------------------------------------------------
Tests from the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA) have confirmed that the
sample from the swan found dead in Fife, Scotland did contain the highly
pathogenic H5N1 avian flu virus.
Scottish and UK officials are already undertaking an urgent veterinary risk
assessment and consulting ornithological experts to consider the specific
circumstances of this case and determine the level of any risk it may pose
to poultry and other kept birds.
However, on the basis of a preliminary risk assessment it has been
concluded that a GB-wide poultry housing requirement would be
disproportionate. We are urgently considering whether there is a need for
any regional measures in addition to those that have already been put in
place in the Protection and Surveillance Zones. Further advice will be
available once the full veterinary assessment is complete and this
situation will be reviewed on a daily basis.
The Scottish Executive has already placed a Protection Zone of 3-km radius
where poultry have been housed and a Surveillance Zone of 10 km around the
site where the bird was found.
There is no reason for public health concern. Avian Influenza is a disease
of birds and whilst it can pass very rarely and with difficulty to humans,
this requires extremely close contact with infected birds, particularly faeces.
The European Commission have been informed of this development.
Notes to Editors:
NHS Fife is closely involved with the planning arrangements that are
currently in place, and is leading the planning for any arrangements to
protect the health of those in close contact with any diseased birds.
Advice from the Food Standards Agency remains that properly cooked poultry
and poultry products, including eggs, are safe to eat.
Guidance on handling and disposing of dead garden and wild birds
----------
The advice given here applies in all circumstances where members of the
public may come across a dead bird.
If you find a dead swan, goose or duck or 3 or more dead wild, or garden
birds together in the same place, please report this to Defra, via the
Defra Helpline on 08459 33 55 77. The current Defra helpline opening hours
are Monday to Friday 6.00am to 10.00pm and Saturday and Sunday 6.00am to
10.00pm.
They may wish to have the birds examined for signs of specific diseases.
They will advise you on what action you should take.
If the dead bird is a single, small garden, or wild bird then you do not
need to call Defra.
You should:
-leave it alone, or
-follow the guidelines below for disposal.
People should follow some simple hygiene precautions that should minimise
the risk of infection. It is hard for people to catch avian influenza from
birds, and the following simple steps are also effective against avian
influenza.
If you have to move a dead bird
-Avoid touching the bird with your bare hands
-If possible, wear disposable protective gloves when picking up and
handling (if disposable gloves are not available [text missing on website]
-Place the dead bird in a suitable plastic bag, preferably leak-proof. Care
should be taken not to contaminate the outside of the bag
-Tie the bag and place it in a 2nd plastic bag
-Remove gloves by turning them inside out and then place them in the 2nd
plastic bag. Tie the bag and dispose of in the normal household refuse bin.
-Hands should then be washed thoroughly with soap and water
-If disposable gloves are not available, a plastic bag can be used as a
make-shift glove.
When the dead bird has been picked up, the bag can be turned back on itself
and tied. It should then be placed in a second plastic bag, tied and
disposed of in the normal household waste
-Alternatively, the dead bird can be buried, but not in a plastic bag
-Any clothing that has been in contact with the dead bird should be washed
using ordinary washing detergent at the temperature normally used for
washing the clothing.
-Any contaminated indoor surfaces should be thoroughly cleaned with normal
household cleaner.

[3] H5N1 in cats: scientific commentary
Date: Thu, 6 Apr 2006
From: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>

Cats are significantly more likely to catch and pass on bird flu than has
generally been thought and could help the virus to mutate to cause a human
pandemic, scientists said today.
The pets' role in the spread of the H5N1 virus, and the potential risk they
pose to their owners, have been underestimated by public and animal health
bodies, according to a team of leading virologists from the Netherlands.
Research at the Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam has shown that the cats
catch bird flu reasonably easily, either by close contact with infected
birds or by eating them, and that they can transmit the virus to other cats.
This could give the H5N1 virus new opportunities to adapt to mammals,
including humans, making the emergence of a pandemic strain that spreads
easily from person to person more likely, the scientists said in the
journal Nature.
Albert Osterhaus, who led the work, said that the findings make it
important for cats to be confined indoors in areas where the disease is
endemic, to limit their contact with infected wild birds or poultry.
Affected regions of Germany and France have already ordered that cats be
kept indoors, but the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
(Defra) has not yet said whether it would make similar provisions should
bird flu reach Britain. [An H5N1-infected swan is said to have been
initially traced in Fife, Scotland, on Tue, 28 Mar 2006. - Mod.AS]
Dr Osterhaus said that while none of the 191 human cases of bird flu has
been contracted from a cat, it is impossible to rule out such transmission.
Though infected cats shed much less of the virus than do birds, the very
close contact that many owners have with their pets could potentially put
them at risk.
"The point we are trying to make is that as soon as the virus becomes
endemic in wild birds or poultry, it would be wise to realise that cats are
susceptible animals," he said. "As soon as you have birds that become sick,
cats are very effective at catching and eating them. Our advice is that in
endemic areas you should keep cats indoors and dogs on the lead [leash].
There is also a public health concern. Although the risk is not large
because the level of virus excretion is lower than birds, there is a
concern because people tend to take good care of sick pets. It is unlikely
that people will get too close to a chicken, but many people do with cats.
You would not want an infected cat in a household situation. There is still
no need to panic, but if you're in an endemic area you should keep your
cats indoors."
The first cases of H5N1 among cats were reported in Thailand in 2004, when
14 out of 15 cats in a household near Bangkok became ill and died after
eating an infected chicken carcass. Infections were then identified among
leopards and tigers fed on poultry at Thai zoos. In Europe, cases have
recently been confirmed among domestic cats in Germany and Austria [We are
not aware of a confirmed Austrian cat; information will be appreciated. -
Mod.AS].
Dr Osterhaus said it was also clear that infection is prevalent among
domestic cats in countries where bird flu is endemic such as in Thailand,
Iraq and Indonesia.
In the last of these, the feline version of the disease has its own name:
"It is sufficiently well known to have been given an onomatopoeic name in
the local Javanese dialect -- "aargh-plop'" he said.
Experiments in Rotterdam have shown that cats can be infected via the
respiratory tract, by eating infected meat, or by contact with other
infected cats. While the overall risk to humans is difficult to assess, it
is impossible to rule out, Dr Osterhaus said.
"Apart from the role that cats may play in H5N1 virus transmission to other
species, they also may be involved in helping the virus to adapt to
efficient human-to-human transmission," he said.
"Cats may provide the virus with an opportunity to adapt to efficient
transmission within and among mammalian species, including humans, thereby
increasing the risk of a human influenza pandemic."
"We believe that the potential role of cats should be considered in
official guidelines for controlling the spread of H5N1 virus infection.
Most international guidelines currently lack such considerations."
"The possible role of cats in the epidemiology of H5N1 virus infection has
been largely overlooked by the human- and animal-health communities."

[4] Nigeria (Lagos): backyard poultry
Date: Thu, 6 Apr 2006
From: Mary Marshall <tropical.forestry@btinternet.com>

The deadly H5N1 bird flu virus has been found in backyard poultry and at a
commercial farm in Lagos, Africa's largest city which is home to about 13
million people, health officials said on Thursday [6 Apr 2006].
The latest discovery of the virus hundreds of miles from Nigeria's 1st
infection indicates the disease is defeating measures to contain it and
raises the prospect of much wider human contact with infected birds.
"We are taking samples from humans who had contact with infected poultry in
Lagos state and sending them to the virology lab," said Jide Coker of the
Health Ministry, who is coordinating the response in Lagos and neighbouring
Ogun state.
H5N1 has been confirmed at Agege Farm, a commercial poultry farm in the
Ikeja area of mainland Lagos, and in backyard poultry in Victoria Island,
an exclusive business district on the Atlantic coast, he said.
A government-run bird flu crisis centre in the capital Abuja said it did
not have information about the Lagos outbreak.
The deadly strain has now been confirmed in poultry in 13 of Nigeria's 36
states and in the Federal Capital Territory, but no human case has been
detected in Africa's most populous country.
Millions of Nigerians keep chickens in their backyards and most poultry is
transported and sold live because the majority of people do not have access
to refrigerators. This has raised fears of widespread contact between
infected birds and humans.
Analysts say a weak health-care system and Nigeria's high mortality rate
could mean that human cases go unreported.
Nigeria was the first country in Africa to report an outbreak of H5N1,
which has killed at least 108 people in Asia and the Middle East since 2003.
The H5N1 strain was first confirmed in Nigeria on 8 Feb 2006 in the
northern state of Kaduna. It spread rapidly across the country despite
efforts to contain it. Burkina Faso became the 5th African country to
confirm the presence of H5N1 this week.
Nigeria has ordered measures such as culling, quarantine and a transport
ban on live poultry in affected areas to contain the disease, but poor
coordination and infrastructure has slowed the implementation.
The U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention has helped Nigerian
laboratories increase their capacity to detect bird flu in both poultry and
humans, and some samples have also been sent to labs in Europe.
The World Bank in March 2006 approved a USD 50 million credit for Nigeria
to help prevent the spread of bird flu.

Re: Avian influenza - worldwide (79): UK (Scotland), Germany
------------------------------------------------------------
In the above post [on AI in Scotland], Ruth Watkins (discussing the
outbreaks in poultry) states: "There's been one incident, I believe, in
Denmark, where one mallard was positive for it on a farm...".
Unfortunately, this information is wrong -- as this event was in Sweden.
The [erroneous statement] may create serious confusion in the present
situation.
