Two more probable cases of West Nile virus have been found in Ontario
residents, bringing the total number of suspected cases to 5, the
province's chief medical officer of health said today. One of the affected
individuals lives in Toronto, the other in Peel Region, Dr Colin D'Cunha
said in a release.
It was announced last week that 3 men in Ontario -- one of whom was in
hospital in serious condition -- had probably contracted the virus. One of
those was likely related to travel in the United States. Confirmatory
testing is currently underway at the National Microbiology Laboratory in
Winnipeg, D'Cunha said in a news release. All results are expected in 2 weeks.
D'Cunha did not say where or how the latest 2 individuals may have
contracted the disease, nor whether they were male or female. David Jensen,
a Health Ministry official, said they were not related to travel.
There have been no confirmed cases of West Nile in humans in Canada and
health officials continue to monitor its presence in birds and mosquitoes.
(As of Tuesday, the US Centers for Disease Control [and Prevention]
reported 673 human cases of West Nile virus had been confirmed in 27 states
and the District of Columbia this year, & 32 people have died of the
virus.) The first sign that West Nile had moved into Canada came last
summer [2001], when a dead bird found in southern Ontario was confirmed to
have died of the virus. Birds are particularly susceptible to the virus and
serve as an early warning system for the disease's progression.
