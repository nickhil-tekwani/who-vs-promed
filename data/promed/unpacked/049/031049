USDA seeks origin of Idaho potato pest
--------------------------------------
American scientists are using DNA comparisons to try to find out how a
microscopic wormlike pest that attacks potato plants made its way into this
country -- an infestation that last year [2006] closed some foreign markets
to US growers.
The United States Department of Agriculture's [USDA] Nematology Laboratory
in Beltsville (Maryland) has compared the DNA of the potato cyst nematodes
found in April 2006 in south eastern Idaho (ID) with other populations and
discovered a close match with nematodes in York, England and the
Netherlands. The Idaho outbreak is believed to be the 1st time the pest was
detected in the US.
But there hasn't been enough DNA testing on nematode populations around the
world to draw any conclusions about the geographic origin of the nematodes
in Idaho, said Dr David Chitwood, research leader of the lab. "It may
provide helpful clues, but as far as absolute conclusions, it really is
difficult," he said. The worms feed at the roots of potato plants and can
reduce crop production by 80 per cent. Officials say the pest is not
harmful to humans and doesn't have any effect on the potatoes themselves.
The nematodes were found at an Idaho potato processing plant, and after the
lab in Beltsville identified them as potato cyst nematodes, they were
traced back to fields in south eastern Idaho's Bingham County. The fields
remain quarantined, and the USDA is spending USD 11 million on a plan to
eradicate the nematodes from about 950 acres (about 385 hectares) in the
nation's top potato-producing state.
Idaho grows about one-third of all the potatoes in the US, producing more
than 12 billion pounds of potatoes last year [2006], worth about USD 712
million to farmers. The discovery of the nematodes sent a shock through the
industry. "You just wouldn't expect (potato cyst nematodes) in the middle
of the state," said Frank Muir, president of the Idaho Potato Commission,
which promotes Idaho potatoes. "It's not like these guys crawl or fly or
anything."
Chitwood said nematodes are spread through infected plants or soil.
Theories of how the nematodes arrived in Idaho range from early immigrants
planting gardens to surplus military equipment that wasn't adequately
cleaned returning from Europe after World War II. Farm equipment brought in
from outside the region has also been considered. Idaho officials say one
reason they can't determine the source is that they may have arrived
decades ago. "The farmers who farmed the land at the time have retired or
passed away," said Mike Cooper, deputy administrator at the Idaho
Department of Agriculture.
After the nematodes were discovered last year [2006], Japan banned all
fresh US potato imports, and Canada and Mexico banned all fresh potato
imports from Idaho. Earlier this year [2007], Canada and Mexico lifted
their bans. Japan still bans fresh potatoes from Idaho, but accepts them
from other states.
Efforts to eradicate the nematodes in Idaho began earlier this year [2007]
when the 950 acres (about 385 hectares) of infected fields were fumigated
and covered with tarps. The fields have since been planted with oil radish
-- which officials said deters potato cyst nematode growth -- and another
fumigation is planned in the fall. Testing after the 1st fumigation showed
the nematodes remained, and killing them could take years. "The thing on
the side of the nematode is it can live in the soil for several years
without a host," said Chitwood. "But the bad thing for the nematode is that
it does not have very many plants that it can reproduce on."
Chitwood said potato cyst nematodes spread from South America, where
potatoes originated, to Europe. He said he was a bit surprised they were
not found in the US before last year [2006], but that border inspections
and care in transporting seed potatoes likely delayed their arrival. How
they arrived remains a mystery. "I think we'll never know who done it on
this one," said Muir.

[2] Wart disease, potato - USA: control strategies
Date: Tue 19 June 2007
Source: Science Daily, American Phytopathological Society (APS) report
[edited]
<http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/06/070618102406.htm>

While many may be familiar with potato late blight, the plant disease
responsible for widespread potato shortages, the lesser known potato wart
has the potential to be as devastating to economies that depend on potato
production, say plant pathologists with the American Phytopathological
Society (APS).
According to Gary Franc, plant pathologist with the College of Agriculture,
Plant Sciences Department at the University of Wyoming, potato wart is a
serious disease of cultivated potato that has been detected worldwide.
Potato wart is caused by the fungus _Synchytrium endobioticum_, which is
considered to be the most important worldwide quarantine plant pathogen of
potato. While not harmful to humans, the disease causes unsightly growths
that initially appear white, and then turn brown or black as they decay,
rendering the potato tuber unrecognizable and inedible. A cross-section of
a potato wart gall on a tuber reveals that galls result from an overgrowth
of tuber tissue. The potato wart pathogen reproduces within gall tissue.
There is a zero tolerance for the fungus that causes potato wart. As a
result, this disease has been placed on the USDA's "Select Agent List" of
plant pathogens deemed to pose a severe threat to plant health or to plant
products. Although direct losses from potato wart may be insignificant when
1st detected, indirect economic losses resulting from zero-tolerance
regulations for potato wart can be devastating to growers. This becomes
especially evident in areas that are subject to quarantine measures, as
well as when the movement of commercial potatoes is restricted.
Spores released from infected plants can make soil unsuitable for potato
production for decades. The long term survival of fungal spores and the
lack of suitable chemical controls for potato wart suppression make this
disease especially problematic for any type of potato production, from
small garden plots to extensive land areas economically dependent on
production of potatoes for consumption or for seed tubers.
"Potato wart is much easier to prevent than it is to control," Franc said.
"It is highly critical that we prevent the introduction of the potato wart
pathogen to production areas and, where it is already introduced, to limit
its spread," he said. "While regulatory action is important in potato wart
management, it is essential that research efforts continue with the goal of
developing and improving reliable and integrated disease suppression
methods to directly deal with this disease," said Franc.

[The nematode referred to in item [1] is pale cyst nematode (PCN;
_Globodera pallida_), which is classed as a very high risk to potato
producing areas. Other hosts include tomato and many species of _Solanum_.
Spread occurs via soil, plant debris, and infected potato tubers. It is
widespread in Europe and parts of South America and also present in a few
locations in Asia.
Another related potato nematode, golden cyst nematode (GCN; _G.
rostochiensis_) has a similarly high impact and is spread in much the same
way. It is even more widely distributed than PCN and has already been found
at a few sites in northern America.
Cultivated radish (_Raphanus sativus_) and 'oil' radish (_R. sativus_
subsp. _oleifera_) have been reported to be effective in the biological
control of some nematodes when used for intercropping or crop rotation with
nematode host plants.
The potato wart fungus _Synchytrium endobioticum_ is considered to be the
most important pathogen of potato. It is endemic in Europe and also
reported from some other locations (see distribution map). The fungus is
spread with soil and by infected seed tubers. Resistant potato cultivars
have been developed, but new pathogen strains are emerging compromising the
efficacy of host plant resistance. Disease management is based on the
control of pathogen spread.
Potato late blight is caused by the fungus _Phytophthora infestans_ and was
responsible for the Irish potato famine in the late 1840s, which resulted
in large-scale population loss from that country due to deaths and emigration.
