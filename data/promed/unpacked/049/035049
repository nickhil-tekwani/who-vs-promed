The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 2 Mar 2020
- Since the start of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 3444, of which 3310 have been confirmed and 134 are probable. In total, have been 2264 deaths (2130 in confirmed and 134 in probable cases) and 1168 people have recovered or survived [3444 minus 2264 makes 1180. - Mod.SH];
- 386 suspected cases under investigation;
- no new confirmed cases for the 14th consecutive day;
- no new deaths among the confirmed cases;
- no new recoveries released from ETCs [Ebola treatment centers];
- no health workers are among the new confirmed cases. The cumulative number of confirmed/probable cases among health workers is 167 (approximately 5% of all confirmed/probable cases), including 41 deaths.

News

The Ebola treatment center in Beni released on Tue 3 Mar 2020 the last confirmed Ebola patient.
- This is a 57 year-old woman from the Kanzulinzuli health area listed on 5 Feb 2020 as contact with her daughter, a nurse.
- She was followed and was vaccinated on 8 Feb 2020 before being discharged the same day as showing no signs of illness.
- Then she was returned to the Police Nationale Congolaise (PNC) cantonment site in Kanzulinzuli.
- She began to show signs on 13 Feb 2020, in particular by anorexia not reported to the community monitoring relay.
- From 14-16 Feb, she felt dizzy (14 Feb 2020), followed by nausea (15 Feb 2020), and headache, asthenia, cough, vomiting, and abdominal pain and diarrhea. She still had not reported to the contact tracking team, or to the PNC site duty nurse. Reasons why she hadn't taken anything as medicine.
- It was on 17 Feb 2020 that with the persistence of the signs rose and fever added and objectified that the lady had been the subject of an alert by the Community Relay. She was sent to the Beni Transit Center (CT) after validation as a suspect case, then the same day, to the Beni Ebola treatment center after confirmation of the Ebola virus disease (EVD).
- It is also good to know that initially 39 contacts were listed around this Ebola survivor.
- Note that this is the 1st time since the declaration by the Ministry of Health of the 10th epidemic of Ebola virus disease that all Ebola treatment centers are empty of confirmed cases of this disease. To date, therefore, there have been zero confirmed cases of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
- The 10th epidemic began on 1 Aug 2018 in Mangina in the Mabalako health zone in the territory of Beni in North Kivu province and spread to the provinces of South Kivu and Ituri in practically 28 other health zones for all 3 provinces.

Vaccination
-----------
- As of 29 Feb 2020, 20 339 people have been vaccinated with the 2nd vaccine Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo (Johnson & Johnson) in the 2 health areas from Karisimbi and Goma.
- Since the start of vaccination on 08 Aug 2018, 299 330 people have been vaccinated with the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine.

Monitoring at entry points
--------------------------
- Since the start of the epidemic, the total number of travelers checked (temperature measurement) at health checkpoints, until 29 Feb 2020, is 157 200 341;
- to date, a total of 109 entry points (PoE) and health control points (PoC) have been established in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri in order to protect the country's major cities and avoid the spread of the epidemic in neighboring countries.

Healthcare and laboratory workers at risk of exposure to Ebola should be vaccinated against the virus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted yesterday [Wed 26 Feb 2020], according to MedPage Today [see below. - Mod.LK].

Committee members voted 14-0 for vaccination against Ebola for healthcare workers at risk of exposure, including those responding to an outbreak, working at federally designated US Ebola treatment centers, and laboratory workers and other staff at US biosafety-level 4 facilities.

The US Food and Drug Administration approved Merck's Ervebo single-dose, live, attenuated vaccine (rVSV-EBOV) for adults in December 2019.

ACIP's Ebola working group said that the vaccine is optional; organizations must decide whether to recommend the vaccine, and pregnant women must decide whether the benefits outweigh the risks of a live vaccine. "We would give a lot of guidance about how the decision was to be made," said ACIP member Sharon Frey, MD, of Saint Louis University School of Medicine in St Louis.

ACIP recommendations are considered final only when published in CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.

There was a brief discussion about vaccine side effects, which included arthralgia and arthritis, although working group members acknowledged there are generally more side effects with a live attenuated vaccine versus a subunit vaccine. Ultimately, the benefits outweighed the risks, they said.

A representative from vaccine manufacturer Merck cited data from "the largest US based study," which found 3.7% of subjects developed arthritis, with a median onset of 11 days following vaccination. All events resolved within 6 months, and there were none after 2 years. In addition, 10% to 50% of participants in the vaccine group reported arthralgia, but it was generally resolved by day 14.

The FDA liaison representative also noted there was "no signal to suggest cardiac toxicity".

Initially, the recommendation included wording about "healthy, non-pregnant, non-lactating adults", as this vaccine is a live virus vaccine, and live virus vaccines are not recommended for pregnant women.]

Ebola virus disease - Democratic Republic of the Congo

From [19-25 Feb 2020], no new confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) were reported. This was the 1st time since the beginning of the response that no new confirmed cases were reported over a 7-day period (figure 1). The most recent case was reported in Beni Health Zone, North Kivu Province on 17 Feb. While the lack of new confirmed cases reported in the last 7 days is a major achievement, the outbreak remains active and risk of additional cases emerging remains high. In the past 21 days (5-25 Feb 2020), 4 confirmed cases were reported from 2 health areas in Beni Health Zone in North Kivu Province (figure 2, table 1). Even with strengthened surveillance operations, transmission of Ebola virus outside of groups currently under surveillance cannot be excluded. Ebola virus also persists in some survivors' body fluids, with potential to infect others. In at least one instance during this outbreak, relapse - in which a person who has recovered from EVD develops symptoms again - was observed, sparking a new chain of transmission which has taken several months to interrupt. To mitigate a potential resurgence of the outbreak, it is critical to maintain response capacities to rapidly detect and respond to any new cases, and to prioritize survivor support and monitoring and the maintenance of cooperative relationships with the survivors' associations.

Substantial surveillance, pathogen detection, and clinical management activities are currently ongoing, including validating alerts, following remaining contacts who were potentially exposed to the virus, supporting rapid diagnostics of suspected cases, and working with community members to strengthen surveillance on people who pass away in the communities. As of [25 Feb 2020], 510 contacts are currently under surveillance, of which 97% were followed daily in the last 7 days. In the last 7 days, more than 5100 alerts per day were reported and investigated, of which over 400 alerts (including approx. 70 community deaths) were validated as suspected EVD cases requiring laboratory testing and specialized care within the established Ebola treatment and transit centres. On average, suspect cases stay in these facilities for 3 days before EVD can be definitively ruled out (i.e. after 2 negative polymerase chain reaction tests 48 hours apart), while care is provided for their illness under isolation precautions. Timely testing of suspected cases continues to be provided across 11 operational laboratories deployed in cities that have been affected by the outbreak. From [17 to 23 Feb 2020], more than 3600 samples were tested.

To maintain operations and prevent potential resurgence of the outbreak, WHO requires further funding. Under the Strategic Response Plan (SRP 4.1), WHO's financial need for the Ebola Response from January to June 2020 is USD 83 million. Thanks to the generosity of many donors during 2019, WHO has some carry-over funding, which has been applied to maintain operations through February 2020. USD 40 million is currently needed to ensure continuity of activities to bring the case incidence to zero, and to continue building strong and resilient health systems.

As of [25 Feb 2020], a total of 3444 EVD cases were reported, including 3310 confirmed and 134 probable cases, of which 2264 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 66%) (table 1). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (n=1928) were female, 28% (n=974) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (n=172) were health care workers.

[3] Funding
- Sun 23 Feb 2020
[VOA News (abridged, edited)]

[byline: Lisa Schlein]

The World Health Organization is urgently appealing for USD 40 million to salvage its operation to bring the Ebola epidemic to an end in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.

The Ebola operation in eastern DR Congo's conflict-ridden North Kivu and Ituri provinces is on financial life-support. WHO reports its coffers will be empty at the end of this month. It is urging donors to step up immediately and contribute the money needed to tackle this virulent disease.

WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic says failure to support this operation would be tragic as good progress is being made in containing the Ebola virus. Over the past 2 months, he says between 3 and 15 cases of Ebola have been reported each week. This is compared to 120 reported cases of Ebola in April 2019. "Last week there was only 1 case reported and we are down to only 2 health zones in eastern DRC where we have Ebola cases. But again, if we do not receive this funding, we risk obviously to have more spread of the virus. So, therefore, there is this appeal to get more funding," he said.

WHO reports 3433 cases of Ebola, including 2253 deaths, for an overall case fatality rate of 66%. Jasarevic says money from the USD 40 million appeal also will be used for preparedness activities in neighboring countries. He notes a modest WHO investment of USD18 million in helping Uganda set up screening, monitoring and other systems succeeded in stopping Ebola from taking root in that country last year [2019]. He tells VOA it is crucial that the Ebola operation not be interrupted because as long as there is one case of the disease, there will be a risk of further spread. "So, we have to really get down to zero. We are making progress, but again, whether you have one case, or you have more cases, the activities that you have to put in place are the same. So, we need to make sure that activities are funded," said Jasarevic.

There have been 8 confirmed cases of Ebola reported from Beni and Mabalako in North Kivu Province in the past 21 days. But WHO reports there have been no new cases reported for more than 42 days from Butembo and Mambasa Health Zones. WHO calls the reduction of geographic spread of the Ebola virus and the declining number of cases encouraging.

Even though the Ebola outbreak appears to be over, it is critical to maintain the infrastructure, surveillance efforts, and training to be prepared for whatever infectious disease appears in the future, whether it is Ebola virus, coronavirus, or a new agent. Funding should not end when an infectious disease agent is no longer causing an outbreak. - Mod.LK
