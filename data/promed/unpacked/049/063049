Nebraska; A mountain Goat and a Sheep Test positive for West Nile Virus
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Lincoln Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory of the University of Nebraska
announced today [Fri 13 Sep 2002] that samples from a mountain goat and a
sheep have been shown to be positive for West Nile virus (WNV). Samples
from both animals were positive by the Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase
Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test for WNV. The samples were also positive by
immunohistochemistry for WNV. The PCR results were confirmed at National
Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) and virus isolation results are
pending at NVSL.

[Previously in 2002 serological evidence of exposure to West Nile virus has
been reported in black bears (3 of 51 samples) and white-tailed deer (7 of
689 samples) in New Jersey, but no evidence of significant disease in
either species. It is not clear in the present case whether the animals
were clinically ill. It is likely that mammals are dead-end hosts, since
even the most susceptible species (equines and humans) are unable to
transmit the virus. - Mod.CP]
