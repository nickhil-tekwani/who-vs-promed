Korea is on high alert over a fatal tick-borne virus following the nation's 1st death this year in May 2014. A man in his 60s died from the deadly virus after showing symptoms of [severe fever with] thrombocytopenia syndrome [SFTS], which includes vomiting and high fever [see ProMED-mail archive no. 20140525.2496906].

The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention examined the 35 Koreans who have been confirmed with the virus over the past year. According to the report, the number of patients was highest in the month of June 2014, accounting for about 1/4th of the total, followed by the months of May, July and September 2014.

Out of the 35 confirmed SFTS cases, 16 people have died so far, putting the fatality rate at 46 per cent.

By area, Jeju Island had the most cases of infection. Authorities attribute this to the relatively high temperatures there, where intermediate tick hosts such as horses and deer can easily be found grazing in the pasture.

The health authorities stress the importance of taking extra caution and avoiding tick bites, since there are no anti-virals or vaccines for the virus. They advise wearing long sleeves and boots when engaging in outdoor activities until October, when ticks are most active, especially during the Korean Thanksgiving season, when people flock to family gravesites to pay their respects.

[This report provides some additional comments on the case previously reported in the 12 May 2014 ProMED-mail post (archive no. 20140525.2496906), and provides an overall perspective on occurrence of acute fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome. Mod.JW commented in a ProMED-mail post dated 26 Feb 2014 (archive no 20140301.2308402), "SFTS virus is a phlebovirus in the Bunyavirus family. It was 1st isolated in China from samples from fever patients in 2009 and has since been detected in Japan and South Korea. The vector was found to be ticks."

"The tick that carries the virus in question, _Haemaphysalis longicornis_, was discovered in South Korea around 30 years ago," said Oh Myeong-don, a doctor of infectious disease and internal medicine at Seoul National University Hospital. "A lot of research has been conducted into the issue in China. The reason the media was reporting that the mortality rate of the disease was 30 per cent is that at 1st, they were only able to find the most serious cases. But now, reports have also been made of people who recovered on their own after being infected and people who only had mild symptoms, which has brought the mortality rate down to 6 per cent," Oh said. "While there is no reason to be overly concerned about the disease, it is still a good idea to make sure you don't get bitten by ticks." (See ProMED archive Severe fever w/ thrombocytopenia synd. - Japan, South Korea: update 20130526.1738022). "The SFTS virus is widespread in China in both the human population and domestic animals (especially goats) harboring ticks."
