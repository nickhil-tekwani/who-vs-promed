Emergency declared in south Russia over swine fever outbreak
------------------------------------------------------------
A state of emergency has been imposed in a district in the Krasnodar
Krai [territory] in south Russia amid an outbreak of the African swine
fever, the regional emergencies center said on Sunday [7 Aug 2011].

The emergencies center told local reporters that the African swine
fever virus (ASFV) was found in a private farm where 15 pigs died of
the disease, but the source of the infection is still unclear.

Local authorities said some 12 000 pigs in and around the Krylovskaya
village, some 3 km [2 mi] away from the private farm, are being
culled, 50 of which have already died of the ASFV in recent days.

In April [2011], the regional emergencies has temporarily declared a
state of emergency in the Labinsky district in the region, as the ASFV
was found at a livestock farm. 85 pigs were culled at the farm.

in the Krasnodar territory; see, with map, at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=10781.

Since the start of the event in September 2009, 139 outbreaks have
been officially reported in Russia, covering a vast territory from the
border areas with Georgia in the south up to the Murmansk region,
bordering Sweden, in the far north; see summary map at

A call for an urgently needed concerted international effort on

was included in ProMED-mail no 20110615.1821.

A new follow-up report from Russia is anticipated. - Mod.AS]
