A major outbreak of jaundice and other water-borne diseases has taken place in Sama area of the city [Vadodara, Gujarat]. Nearly 150 people are ill in the area in various residential localities.

Water contamination that took place about 10 days ago is believed to be the reason for the outbreak. Residents of the area had complained regarding this to Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) officials.

According to VMC officials, 61 cases of jaundice and 88 cases of diarrhoea and gastroenteritis have been detected in the area during the last 3 days. The localities that have been affected are located between Chanakyapuri crossroads and Narmada branch canal located ahead.

VMC teams have been conducting door-to-door surveys in the affected parts and have so far covered over 3200 houses.

VMC medical officer (health) Dr Devesh Patel said extensive screening of the residents had been done and they had been given chlorine tablets to purify water and oral rehydration solution packets. He added that the water samples collected now were uncontaminated.

Sources said that work on a pipeline was conducted in the area about 10 days ago. Even as this was being done there were heavy rains while the pipeline was still open and this may have contaminated water. Residents had complained of dirty water supply around the same time.

[The news report above describes an outbreak that included 61 cases of jaundice 10 days after an incident of water contamination. A water-borne disease that produces jaundice with an incubation period of about 10 days suggests a diagnosis of leptospirosis. Hepatitis A and E, other water-borne infectious diseases that also produce jaundice, have longer incubation periods (such as 2 to 8 weeks).

Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that is distributed throughout the world in warm climates and is transmitted to humans by direct contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes with the urine of infected animals, or by contact with wet soil, vegetation, or water that has been contaminated with infected animal urine. These animals are mostly asymptomatic but chronically infected with one of the several hundred serovars of pathogenic _Leptospira_. Different leptospiral serovars are prevalent in particular geographical regions. In carrier animals with chronic renal infections, leptospiruria persists for long periods or for life.

_Leptospira_ bacteria shed in urine may survive in water or moist soil for weeks to months. Many species of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rodents) are susceptible to chronic urinary infection with pathogenic _Leptospira_. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers. In fact, the news report above says that there were heavy rains during instillation of a water pipeline, while the pipeline was still open, which may have contaminated the water supply.

However, because of the relatively nonspecific nature of the clinical presentation of leptospirosis, its diagnosis cannot be made confidently without laboratory confirmation.

Vadodara, with a population of almost 1.6 million people in 2005, is the 3rd largest city in the Indian State of Gujarat (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vadodara). Gujarat is in western India and is bordered by the Indian states of Maharashtra to the south and Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan to the east, the Pakistani province of Sindh on the north, and the Arabian Sea on the west. A map of Indian states is accessible at http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm. - Mod.ML]

[While leptospirosis is the more likely diagnosis given the probable incubation period of approximately 7-10 days, it is also possible that there was an ongoing background outbreak of hepatitis in the area (pre-dating the installation of the new water pipeline) that was unrecognized until after the identification of the acute diarrheal outbreak, which led to an investigation of water-borne diseases in the area. More information on the etiology of this outbreak of jaundice would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP
