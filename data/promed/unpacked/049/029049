Epidemic of Rotavirus Infection in Infants in Southern China
------------------------------------------------------------
FOSHAN CITY (Canton Province). During the past 2 weeks, all hospitals have
been overcrowded due to an epidemic of rotavirus infection in infants.
Doctors have been working prolonged hours to treat thousands of infected
infants (mainly up to 3 years of age). Currently, no vaccine is available
for immunization against this virus.

[Rotavirus infection in infants is a global problem. After a short
incubation period of 24-48 hours there is sudden onset of illness
(predominantly watery diarrhea). Untreated rotavirus infection is a major
cause of infant mortality in underdeveloped countries. Treatment is by
oral, subcutaneous or intravenous rehydration, and is effective if begun
promptly. Unfortunately, a promising candidate vaccine had to be withdrawn
recently because of a low frequency of cases of intussusception
(invagination of the lining of the intestine) among vaccinees. Rotaviruses
are classified into groups A-E on serological and other properties. Group B
rotaviruses have been associated with widespread outbreaks in children and
young adults in China, but rarely elsewhere. - Mod.CP
