No abnormalities found in flu vaccine, yet
------------------------------------------
Medical authorities have yet to get to the bottom of the flu vaccine
scare in Western Australia (WA), with tests so far showing no signs
of abnormalities. Chief medical officer Jim Bishop says there is a
possibility that a spike in cases of fever and convulsions for young
children in WA could simply be linked to the higher number of
vaccinations performed there. He has sought to reassure the public
once more following last week's moratorium on seasonal flu
vaccinations for children aged under 5.

To date there have been 57 cases in WA, compared to 6 in Victoria, 4
in NSW [New south Wales] and Queensland, 2 in South Australia and one
each in Tasmania and the ACT [Australian Capital Territory].

Tests conducted by the manufacturer, the Therapeutic Goods
Administration and other independent experts have so far failed to
pinpoint a possible cause, Professor Bishop said. "We don't have
evidence at this time that there's any abnormality with the batch or
with the vaccine," he said. But authorities should have a better idea
once some of the investigations conclude next week.

Doctors across the states and territories have been asked to trawl
through previous records in a search for more cases. Prof Bishop said
some 3 million doses of the seasonal flu vaccine have gone out this
year, with up to 2-3rds sent to WA. It could be a "partial
explanation" as to why the western state has experienced a much
higher rate of complications, normally expected in one out of every
1000 to 10 000 cases, Prof Bishop said. WA provides the seasonal flu
shot for free to children under 5, whereas the rest of the country doesn't.

Each year, CSL's Fluvax vaccine contains fragments of 3 different
types of influenza virus as recommended by the Therapeutic Goods
Administration (TGA). The 2010 version includes the swine flu strain
H1N1. The last paediatric study of Fluvax occurred in 2004-05 but
"quality testing" is conducted every year, CSL said. A trial of the
separate swine flu vaccine for children was conducted in 2009.

This morning [30 Apr 2010], federal Health Minister Nicola Roxon
urged the elderly to continue having the seasonal flu shot. "It's not
something that is ordinarily given to young children," Ms Roxon said.
"Its major target and the areas the commonwealth funds is for older
Australians over 65. "(There are) absolutely no reports of any concerns there."
