By autopsy inspection of the perished ibex and chamois a viral encephalitis
was suspected. It is most likely that those animals are occasionally in
contact with free ranging cattle which feed on the same alpine pasture
land. Although most herpesviruses are know to have a very narrow host
range, an infection with a bovine herpesvirus (either BHV-4 or BHV-5) might
have caused the encephalitis. Another possible agent to cause the described
symptoms would be Borna virus, but the epidemiological data (seven affected
animals within two weeks) argues against it.
