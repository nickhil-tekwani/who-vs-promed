Rabies outbreak in East London
------------------------------
Following an outbreak of rabies in and around East London, state
veterinary services are urging dog owners in the area to visit their
mobile clinics to get their pets vaccinated against the deadly disease.

"People are urged to take rabies seriously; they should turn up in
great numbers when the departmental officials come to their areas,
and in that way they will be able to protect their dogs and
themselves from rabies," the province's agriculture department said
in a statement on Tuesday [8 Apr 2008].

Rabies was endemic in South Africa and responsible for a number of
deaths each year.

"Tragically, those who succumb to the disease did not get correct
post-exposure treatment. People who are exposed to dog bites must
seek immediate medical attention.

"Following the confirmed outbreak of dog rabies in East London, in
Nahoon [and] at the Bonza Bay area, the veterinary services will be
conducting a rabies campaign in the area.

"Owners of all pets are requested to bring their animals to be
vaccinated for rabies, and the vaccination will be free of charge,"
the department said.

[East London, a city with a population of about 250 000 and over 700
000 in the metropolitan area, is situated on the Indian Ocean coast,
Eastern Cape, SE South Africa. It can be located on the
HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at

Details on the mentioned outbreak, including the number and
characteristics (owned? strays?) of the rabid animals and the number
of exposed humans, will be helpful.

Rabies is endemic in South Africa. During 2006 (the most recent
available data on OIE's WAHID (World Animal Health Information
Database) animal disease interface), 27 rabies cases were reported
from the Eastern Cape province, out of a total of 472 throughout
South Africa in 2006 (the largest number reported from
KwaZulu-Natal). During the said year, there were 31 human cases
(obviously, all fatal) throughout the country. - Mod.AS]
