The report in The Australian newspaper contained the following
information attributed to Queensland Health: "...7 reports of people
being bitten or scratched by flying foxes or bats last year [2009],
most of whom received successful prophylactic treatment for
lyssavirus. Of the 28 animals caught and tested, 5 had lyssavirus. Up
to a 6th of bats and flying foxes in Queensland are thought to be infected."

The correct information is as follows:

- Less than one percent of all bats, including flying foxes, in
Queensland are thought to be infected

- Up to 5-10 percent of sick, injured or orphaned bats are thought to
be infected

- Less than 20 percent of bats infected with Australian Bat
Lyssavirus present with clinical signs that include
aggression/approaching people.

Up to the present, there are now 11 known rabies-related viruses,
only 7 of which are well classified (10 of the 11 affects bats).
There is a [genetic] correlation and a [antigenic] cross-reaction
between the different viruses, but they are not close to 100 percent.
Between bat rabies virus strains and the rabies viruses of
terrestrial mammals, the correlation is from zero percent (Lagos bat
virus) and higher, whereas between Australian Bat lyssavirus and
classical rabies virus, the genetic correlation (and antigenic
cross-reaction) is over 78 percent but not 100 percent. For this
reason, as well as for the fact that people who were previously
vaccinated against rabies (pre-exposure) and [subsequently] handled
bats have died from rabies, I think it is too much to claim that
post-exposure prophylaxis therapy has proved to be totally effective
when bats are involved. It is the best and the only therapy we have
today, but it is definitely not "totally effective" as was stated.
