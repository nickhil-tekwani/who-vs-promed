Armenian authorities have imposed a quarantine in the Gegharkunik
[province] of Armenia on suspicion of a foot-and-mouth disease [FMD]
outbreak, Hovhannes Mkrtchian, head of the Veterinary Inspection of
the State Food Safety Service of the Ministry of Agriculture, told a
news conference today [9 Jun 2011].

"There are some reasons to suspect that cattle there may have
contracted FMD, but for the time being, we are not 100 percent sure.
An epidemiological study was made there, and based only on its results
will we be able to say whether there is an outbreak or not," said
Mkrtchian.

According to him, the authorities have banned export of livestock
products from the province. At the same time, Mkrtchian denied rumours
about detecting cases of the disease and even deaths in livestock in
Tavush region.

"Work on the prevention of livestock diseases is ongoing, and the
process of vaccination against FMD is 98 percent completed. Our plan
of action for this year [2011] calls for action against 10 different
livestock diseases," he said, adding that the vaccines are free.

[According to the WRLFMD data, FMD was last reported from Armenia in
2001 (serotype Asia 1) and 2000 (serotype O).

Armenia's data on OIE's WAHID indicates routine FMD vaccination as
one of the measures related to FMD. According to the annual report for
2010, 989 342 cattle were vaccinated, while the total national cattle
population (2010) was 570 633. This may mean that revaccinations were
applied as well.

Official confirmation of the current media report on FMD circulation,
or its exclusion, is requested. In case affirmative, serotyping is
anticipated.

Among Armenia's neighbours (Georgia, Azerbaijan, Iran and Turkey),
the latter 2 are known to be FMD-infected.

Armenia denied unofficial reports of FMD outbreaks during 2006;
ProMED-mail's requests of May 2007 and July 2007 for information on
suspected, media-reported outbreaks in the provinces Syunik and Lori
remained unanswered.

The province of Gegharkunik (or Gelark'unik) is in central-east
Armenia, bordering Azerbaijan; see map at
