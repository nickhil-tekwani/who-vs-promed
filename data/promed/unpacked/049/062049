1st test clears Macedonian bird of avian flu: official
-----------------------------------------------
A bird that died in Macedonia about 2 weeks ago has tested negative
for avian influenza in an initial British laboratory screening, a
Macedonian health official said.

"1st results show that there is no bird flu," said Sloboden Cokrevski
of Macedonia's Veterinary Directorate.

Cokrevski said the results were "not final, and we cannot be 100
percent sure, but so far, no type of H virus has been found" in the
suspect bird, which was sent to Britain for testing last month [October 2005].

The domestic fowl was among some 1000 other chickens and turkeys
found dead in the villages of Mogila and Germijan, about 200 km (120
miles) southwest of the capital Skopje, in mid-October 2005.

In response, Macedonian health authorities destroyed thousands of
chickens, roosters and turkeys amid fears that a deadly variant of
the bird flu had hit the country.

According to Cokrevski, more dead birds had been found in the past
few days "but, without any doubt, it is not connected with bird flu," he said.

[This outbreak has been initially diagnosed as Newcastle disease. The
Macedonian report to the OIE, dated 19 Oct 2005, included the
following statement: "As part of the increased danger of avian
influenza (AI) outbreaks, and in relation to the time period, which
poses greater danger of introducing AI virus via migratory birds, as
well as for differential diagnosis, all sera were tested with an
antibody test kit for AI virus strains H7N2, H1N7, H7N3, H13N6, H5N9,
H11N6, H3N8, H9N2, H5N2, H4N8, H10N7, H2N2, H8N4, H14N5, H6N5 and
H12N5. One serum gave a positive result to the serological test. ...
Samples will be sent to the OIE Reference Laboratory for AI, VLA
Weybridge, United Kingdom for confirmation. In the meantime, the
control measures imposed remain in force" (see posting 20051020.3060,
including Mod.PC's comments). The said antibody test kit did not
include virus strain H5N1, nor any N1. Could this be explained?

It is relieving to note that the suspected sample has, so far, been
found negative; final verdict is anticipated. The Macedonian
authorities deserve to be commended for their proactive, cautious
attitude. - Mod.AS]
