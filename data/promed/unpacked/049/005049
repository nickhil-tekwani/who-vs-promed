West Nile Virus Responsible for Death of Humboldt Penguins at Milwaukee Zoo
--------------------------------------------------
The death of at least 8 Humboldt penguins [attributed ] to West Nile virus
infection at the Milwaukee County Zoo is the most significant loss due to
the mosquito-borne disease suffered by any single zoo in the country, a
leading veterinarian said here on Thu 10 Oct 2002. Dominic Travis, a
veterinarian at Chicago's Lincoln Park Zoo, heads a project to track West
Nile virus's impact on zoos and wildlife parks around the country. Travis
presented first-year results at a meeting of the American Association of Zoo
Veterinarians in Milwaukee on Thu 10 Oct 2002.
The penguin deaths occurred in September 2002, just after the one-year mark
for data collection. Around the country, Travis said, the first year of
sampling turned up 150 cases of lab-confirmed West Nile virus infection in
35 species. Another 250 initially positive samples are awaiting confirmation
by further testing, covering 70 species including alpacas, zebras, emus, and
a kind of lizard called a crocodile monitor, Travis said. Species with more
than 3 animals testing positive include bats, penguins, mergansers, crows,
other penguin species, flamingos, and owls.
In Milwaukee, zoo officials have said that blood tests and tissue samples
showed West Nile virus in at least 8 of the 11 penguin deaths. They believe
that one penguin died of other causes. Tests are pending on 2 others, and 10
of the zoo's 12 surviving Humboldt penguins are hospitalized with symptoms
of what is suspected to be West Nile virus infection. "If that's true, it's
the worst" impact of the virus on any one zoo, Travis said.
West Nile virus is primarily a bird disease that has spread to humans and a
host of other animals through the bite of infected mosquitoes. The disease
was first detected in 1999 in the New York area, largely through the efforts
of experts at the Bronx Zoo in New York, particularly pathologist Tracey
McNamara, who worked with Travis to establish the zoo surveillance project.
More than 100 zoos now participate, and the project gets money from the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It has several components,
including testing any outdoor birds or mammals that appear ill, testing
birds or animals for West Nile virus whenever they're handled for other
reasons, and testing stored blood samples for the presence of the virus.
No one knows why West Nile virus has had such a large impact on the zoo in
Milwaukee, where the human epidemic has been quite modest. Wisconsin
accounts for only 28 of the nearly 2900 human cases reported to the CDC so
far this year, while neighboring Illinois and Michigan have had major
outbreaks, reporting 656 and 409 cases, respectively. Some experts speculate
that West Nile might be spread bird-to-bird, but the mechanism and frequency
of such an event, if it occurs, are unknown.
West Nile virus infection is still such a novel disease that "almost every
case that occurs is a new case" in terms of its impact on zoo animals, said
Roberta Wallace, the Milwaukee zoo's senior staff veterinarian. Unknown
issues are the long-term effect on birds and animals surviving West Nile
virus infection, whether it can be passed parent-to-[offspring], and whether
having had the virus will affect an animal's fertility. "All of these things
are going to require long-term follow-up," McNamara said. West Nile "has
been a wake-up call for all zoos," said the veterinary association's executi
ve director, Wilbur Amand.

Scattered reports of West Nile virus infection and fatalities in species
other than humans, horses, and certain birds may produce a distorted
impression of relative susceptibility of various species and higher
taxonomic groups to infection, illness, and death from West Nile virus
infection. I may have missed it, but I did not see mention in ProMED-mail of
data collected and shared by US zoos, many of which have been following the
infection rates of their animals closely, in part for fear of losing
significant genetic diversity in breeding programs for endangered and
near-extinct species.
On Wed 2 Oct 2002, journalist John Nielson on National Public Radio's
"Morning Edition" presented a segment on the zoo situation:

[In fact, most of the reports of West Nile virus infection among zoo animals
have concerned avian species. For the benefit of ProMED-mail subscribers,
the following is an abbreviated version of John Nielsen's report.
West Nile virus, fatal to more than 100 Americans so far, is taking a
similar toll at US zoos. By one count, more than 150 zoo animals have died
of the mosquito-borne illness since 1999. Many species of birds are on that
casualty list: flamingos, owls, kestrels & hawks as well as penguins,
eagles, and geese. Emu have perished, and so has an Andean condor.
At Chicago's Lincoln Park Zoo, epidemiologist Dominick Travis told Nielsen
there's "no reason to believe" that the atmosphere at a zoo poses a greater
danger than any other part of a city where West Nile virus has been
detected. In fact, zoos are taking many precautions to improve testing and
surveillance programs. "It's all about getting results as soon as possible
so you can act," Travis says. At some zoos, birds have been injected with a
vaccine developed for horses, but there's no proof it will work. Other
institutions bring the most vulnerable animals indoors at dawn and dusk,
when mosquitoes carrying the virus are most active.
An overriding fear, as Nielsen points out, is that the virus has the
potential to put irreplaceable animals at risk. Population geneticist Steve
Thompson cites the example of the Micronesian kingfisher. He tells Nielsen
there are no more than 65 of the birds left in the world, and all are in
North American zoos. They've been kept from extinction for the past 15 years
by vigorous human intervention. "If West Nile virus hit them it could be
potentially disastrous," Thompson says.
Health officials are also watching zoos closely, since the virus strikes
animals before it reaches people. "Public health officials used to ignore
the West Nile case numbers coming out of zoos," Nielsen says. "Now they
treat them like intelligence reports." Local governments and federal
agencies are helping zoos improve testing and surveillance programs, hoping
to detect the virus as soon as possible.
ProMED-mail has routinely reported the occurrence of West Nile virus in zoo
animals, usually embedded in updates and other collected reports. Some
