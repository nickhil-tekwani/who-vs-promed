There is an outbreak of clinically confirmed botulism (sausage poisoning) in South Jutland [Sydjylland]. The Food Administration has been involved in the case since Sunday morning [17 Jun 2018]. It is normal for the Board of Patient Safety to involve the Food Administration in cases of suspected food.

The Danish Food Agency has taken samples of the leftover food that the individuals ate and they are now being analyzed. The result is expected in about 5 days. The information obtained suggests that the source of infection should be found in a food that only the poisoned patients have ate.

Manufactured foods are basically very safe in relation to botulism, as pH and salt content are controlled in production. Cases of botulism are very rare in Denmark.

[The copyrighted website https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2018/06/22/Foodborne-botulism-outbreak-at-private-party-in-Denmark# reports that there are 6 cases and one possible case among 11 individuals who attended a private dinner in the town of Sonderborg on 15 Jun 2018. The suspected vehicle of the intoxication is not yet stated. ProMED would appreciate more information regarding this outbreak.

The paralytic intoxication botulism, or sausage poisoning as it was originally termed, is caused by one of the neurotoxins produced by (primarily) _Clostridium botulinum_ bacteria in foods not properly prepared. It was first seriously studied following an outbreak in Wildbad, Germany in 1793. The outbreak involved 13 people, 6 of whom died, and was associated with consumption of a locally produced blood sausage. Following this outbreak, the number of reported cases of sausage poisoning rapidly increased, prompting a study of the disease by local health officer Justinius Kerner (1829). He described 230 cases, most of which were attributed to the consumption of sausage. The illness became known as "botulism" after "botulus", the Latin word for sausage. - Mod.LL
