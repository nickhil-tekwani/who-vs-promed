[It is hard to assess the significance of this report. No information is provided regarding the cause of death of the student, other than the diagnosis of GB virus infection, and the possible association of this virus with hepatitis.

According to the Public Health Agency of Canada Hepatitis G fact sheet (http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/hcai-iamss/bbp-pts/hepatitis/hep_g-eng.php): an agent designated HGV/GBV-C [and sometimes described as hepatitis G virus] was first described in 1995-96. It has since been identified as a single stranded RNA virus belonging to the family _Flaviviridae_, and unrelated to any of the well characterised hepatitis virus (A, B, C, D, and E). Its clinical characteristics are the following: Carrier rate of between 2 and 5 per cent in the general population. Causes persistent infection for up to 9 years in 15-30 per cent of adults. HGV/GBV-C is often found in co-infections with other viruses, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). There is little proof that hepatitis G (Hep G) causes serious liver disease at any age. It is possible that HGV/GBV-C may not be a true 'hepatitis' virus. The signs and symptoms are dissimilar to those of other hepatitis viruses.

Transmission is by infected blood or blood products. HGV/GBV-C can be transmitted by sharing personal items contaminated with the virus and other similar behaviours (parenterally), from mother-to-newborn child at birth (vertical), or various sexual activities. There is currently no recommended treatment for Hep G virus infection. Evidence of HGV/GBV-C infection has been found in 1-4 per cent of the Canadian blood donor population (2001). - Mod.CP
