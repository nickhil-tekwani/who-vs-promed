Emergency Management Warning 10: Newcastle disease in California in
backyard poultry
-------------------------------
Officials with the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) and
the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) are conducting an
eradication campaign for Newcastle disease. The disease was confirmed on 1
October 2002, and is restricted to backyard poultry. Clinical signs in
infected birds include respiratory, nervous, and gastrointestinal signs.
Mortality is up to 90 per cent of exposed birds.
Commercial poultry, at this time, are not involved in the disease
occurrence. Investigations are on-going and all figures are pending final
validation.
Situation update:
Number of premises positive: 108
Number of contacts: 338
Number of premises depopulated: 285
Premises waiting to be depopulated: 161
Birds depopulated to date: 24 000 (approximate)
Counties with positive flocks: Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino
Operational Update:
The date of the last discovered positive case of Newcastle disease in
California was 5 December 2002.
Effective 13 November 2002, the California State Veterinarian has imposed a
quarantine (Food and Agriculture Code Section 9562) on the following
counties: all of Los Angeles County; portions of Riverside County; portions
of San Bernardino County.
Effective November 21, 2002, APHIS has imposed a federal quarantine that
regulates the interstate movement of poultry and poultry products from
California's already quarantined areas. Poultry species affected by
California's quarantine are: chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese, grouse,
partridges, pheasants, quails, guinea fowl, peafowl (peacocks), doves,
pigeons, awans, ratites and ratite eggs.
State and federal animal health officials are conducting door-to-door
surveys to identify fowl and other birds in the affected areas and are
following up on all epidemiological associations. To date, depopulation,
cleaning and disinfecting, and carcass disposal are being conducted by CDFA
and APHIS. CDFA has closed all poultry exhibits and fairs and expositions
within the State of California.
The Newcastle disease situation is contained and is still considered a
single outbreak cluster within a 30mile radius in Los Angeles County and
along the Los Angeles/Riverside/San Bernardino County border.
Affected and exposed backyard poultry are being euthanized and
double-bagged. Task force members are disinfecting the bags and
transporting the carcasses to restricted landfills for burial. All
door-to-door surveillance, along with interviews has established that there
have been no links to eastern states within the United States and no
exposure to other backyard poultry in other states.
Local commercial table egg layer birds are being closely monitored and will
only be allowed to move intrastate under CDFA monitoring and spent-hen
movements restricted to the day they are scheduled for processing.
New Trade Issues:
None
Please forward this information to your federal, state, and industry
counterparts as necessary. If you have questions about this situation
please contact USDA APHIS <EMOC@APHIS.USDA.GOV>.
