Myanmar: Avian influenza situation
--------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health in Myanmar has confirmed the country's 1st
case of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. The case
is a 7-year-old female from Kyaing Tone Township, Shan State (East).

The case was detected through routine surveillance following an
outbreak of H5N1 in poultry in the area in mid-November [2007]. She
developed symptoms of fever and headache on 21 Nov 2007 and was
hospitalized on 27 Nov 2007. She has now recovered. Samples taken from
the case tested positive for H5N1 [virus] at the National Health
Laboratory in Yangon, and the National Institute of Health in
Thailand. The diagnosis was further confirmed at the WHO Collaborating
Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza, National Institute of
Infectious Diseases in Tokyo, Japan.

A team from the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Livestock and
Fisheries and the WHO Country Office are conducting investigations to
confirm the source of her infection. Initial findings indicate
poultry die off in the vicinity of the case's home in the week prior
to the onset of illness. To date, all identified contacts of the case
remain healthy and ongoing surveillance activities in the area have
not detected any further cases.

[This report following closely on that of 2 fatalities in northern
Pakistan marks a further new extension in the range of human cases of
H5N1 avian influenza virus infections. - Mod.CP]

[It is encouraging to see Myanmar has been conducting routine
surveillance following an outbreak of H5N1 in poultry in the area.
This is the way for countries to quickly identify spread to humans,
and should be adopted by all affected countries. ? Mod.JW]
