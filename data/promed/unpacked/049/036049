In the past 24 hours, the number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran have grown from 43 to 61 - an increase of 18 newly confirmed cases. The number of fatalities has also increased from 8 to 12, an increase of 4 new fatalities. Repeating my comment from yesterday "One suspects as testing expands and more milder clinical presentations are found to be SARS-CoV-2-positive, the reported case fatality rate will be lower. The epidemiologic picture is still unfolding."

Qom is located to the southwest of Tehran in central Iran, and Guila is to the northwest of both Qom and Tehran and is located on the Caspian Sea. Newly mentioned provinces with confirmed cases include Alborz, bordering Tehran on its northwest, Hamedan to the west of Tehran towards the border with Iraq, and Mazandaran bordering Tehran on the north and located on the Caspian Sea.

Pakistan, which also shares a border with Iran has deployed more medical personnel from Rapic Response Teams to identify and test suspected cases. https://www.urdupoint.com/en/health/coronavirus-rapid-response-health-team-deplo-846010.html

Social media has been filled with "reports" of cases in many of the countries, and Ministries of Health are going on record and denying there have been cases. More rumors than observed in the East Asian countries.

That being said, why do I have a sense of my favorite epidemiologic adage: "Seek and ye shall find"? With the ongoing significant outbreak in Iran, I suspect the global and regional recognition of the importance of Qom as a center for travel within the region, both for religious pilgrims as well as scholars, there was a realization that there might be imported cases, similar to what happened in East Asia and the impact of tourists to and from Wuhan and elsewhere in China. The big concern is whether there were imported cases prior to the past few days, and could there be below the surveillance radar ongoing transmission of the coronavirus in 1 or more of these countries?

2) 8th fatality reported
Date: 24 Feb 2020 [KT]

An 8th patient died of the new coronavirus as infections once again soared, reaching a total of 833 Monday, 231 more than on Sunday [23 Feb 2020].

A coronavirus patient who was hospitalized at Kyungpook National University Hospital in Daegu died shortly past 4 p.m. Monday [24 Feb 2020], health officials said. The patient was said to have been hospitalized at Daenam Hospital in Cheongdo County, North Gyeongsang, before testing positive for the virus. Of Korea's 8 fatalities from the coronavirus, six were hospitalized at Daenam before contracting the disease, including a 59-year-old and 62-year-old man who died Sunday [23 Feb 2020] night.

As in the past few days, many of Korea's latest infections Monday were traced to the Shincheonji church in Daegu - either adherents of the controversial Christian sect or people who came into contact with them - and Daenam Hospital. Among Korea's 231 new infections tallied Monday by 4 p.m., at least 129 were related to Shincheonji and 2 were related to Daenam Hospital. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said Monday [24 Feb 2020] afternoon they were investigating 70 patients out of that day's 231 to figure out whether they had any connections to Shincheonji or Daenam Hospital.

Infections remain heavily concentrated in Daegu - which is the nation's 4-largest city - and the surrounding southeastern province of North Gyeongsang, with 681, or 81.8 percent of the total [cases]. Local health officials say they still don't know how the virus 1st reached the hospital or got into the Shincheonji church community. But Daenam Hospital was where a mourning altar was set up between [31 Jan 2020] and [2 Feb 2020] for the older brother of the Shincheonji church's leader, Lee Man-hee. Many followers are believed to have attended the service.

Gimpo officials said Sunday [23 Feb 2020] night that a 16-month-old baby girl in the city appeared to have contracted the disease from her parents, becoming the youngest coronavirus patient in the nation. It was the 2nd known time in Korea that a person under the age of 10 was reported infected with the disease, which seems to be prevalent among the middle-aged. The other under-10 patient is a 4-year-old girl in Daegu, who apparently contracted the disease from a day care center teacher. The KCDC said the 16-month-old and 4-year-old females were in stable condition Monday.

According to Gimpo officials Sunday [23 Feb 2020], the infant and her parents - aged 32 and 33 - all went to a relative's wedding at the Queenvell Hotel in Dong District, Daegu, on [15 Feb 2020], where they stayed for about an hour and a half. The wedding was also attended by Patient No. 31, a Shincheonji churchgoer in Daegu. The 32-year-old wife felt a cough and sore throat come on shortly after returning from the wedding and tested positive for the coronavirus last Friday [21 Feb 2020], followed by her husband, who tested positive later the same day [20 Feb 2020], Gimpo officials said. The 16-month-old daughter tested negative Sunday [23 Feb 2020] in her 1st test, but results came out positive on a 2nd test later that day [23 Feb 2020].

Officials in Busan, Korea's 2nd-largest city, said Monday [24 Feb 2020] nearly half of the city's infections were traced to the Presbyterian Onchun Church in Dongnae District, stoking fears that the virus was spreading in a religious community as in the Daegu Shincheonji church. A total of 50 infections were reported in Busan by Monday [24 Feb 2020] at 4 p.m., at least 22 of which were said to be traced to Onchun Church. When including another Onchun churchgoer in Gimhae, South Gyeongsang, who contracted the virus, a total of at least 23 infected people have connections with the church.

According to Busan officials, many of the infections related to the church were teens or young adults in their 20s who went to an overnight church camp on [15 and 16 Feb 2020]. Some 150 people were said to have attended the camp. The church closed all its facilities last Saturday [22 Feb 2020] and said it would reopen in two weeks, the incubation period of the coronavirus.

Asiad Hospital, a hospital for the elderly in Yeonje District, Busan, was placed under so-called cohort isolation Monday [24 Feb 2020] morning after a 56-year-old woman who works there tested positive for the coronavirus Sunday [23 Feb 2020]. Cohort isolation refers to the shutdown of an entire medical institution to prevent the spread of a contagious disease. There are 193 patients at the hospital and about 100 workers, Busan officials said. The hospital will reopen after the 14-day incubation period on [7 Mar 2020]. The 56-year-old woman was said to have connections to Shincheonji, though it was unclear whether she was a churchgoer or had contact with one.

Among Deagu's latest infections, one was identified as the head of the Daegu Seo District public health office's infectious disease prevention team - who was a Shincheonji adherent. Daegu Mayor Kwon Young-jin said in a press conference Monday [24 Feb 2020] morning that it was only after the public official tested positive for the virus Sunday [23 Feb 2020] that he told his colleagues he goes to the Daegu Shincheonji church. Some 50 workers at the public health office were subsequently ordered to quarantine themselves in their homes for the next 2 weeks, Kwon said.

In Seoul, where 29 coronavirus patients have been confirmed so far, the city announced Monday [24 Feb 2020] it ordered some 5700 day care centers to close for 2 weeks; set up a children-only coronavirus checkup zone at 2 hospitals; temporarily shut down several public facilities including libraries, museums and stadiums; and advised 70 percent of the workforce at Seoul City Hall to shift their work hours from 9 a.m.-6 p.m. to 10 a.m.-7 p.m. to reduce commuting risks.

The Seoul Metropolitan Government said in a statement that the city has decided to accept severe coronavirus patients from other areas of the country to help with medical treatment and offer medical equipment to Daegu and North Gyeongsang. Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon said Monday [24 Feb 2020] that Shincheonji was refusing to provide a full list of its worshippers living in Seoul, adding that its uncooperative behavior was preventing Seoul officials from contacting them and asking about their symptoms. If Shincheonji continues to refuse, Park floated the option of asking the police to raid their offices.

The National Court Administration advised courts nationwide Monday [24 Feb 2020] to adjourn all cases for the time being unless they were urgent matters.

The United States Forces Korea (USFK) announced Monday [24 Feb 2020] afternoon in a statement that it was told by the KCDC "a USFK dependent" living in Daegu tested positive for the coronavirus, marking the 1st time a USFK-related individual has contracted the disease. "The patient, a 61-year-old female, visited Camp Walker's post exchange on [12 and 15 Feb 2020], and KCDC and USFK health professionals are actively conducting contact tracing to determine whether any others may have been exposed," said the USFK. "The USFK encourages all personnel to continue to practice strict proper hygiene procedures as the best ways to prevent the spread of viruses and protect the USFK population."

[In the past 24 hours the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 231 cases and 3 deaths. The above media report presents a detailed and interesting accounting of the reported cases and the association with one or 2 religious institutions which appear to have served as ideal mass gathering disease transmission foci. The reluctance on the part of one of the sects to provide a list of all members of the sect may well be concerns for the resultant stigma the members will be subjected to, given the details of suspected cases being shared publicly. I strongly recommend people read the Subject in focus: Risk Communications to Address Stigma in today's WHO Situation update in section [6] below.

C. Italy: 220 cases, 7 deaths
Date: Mon 24 Feb 2020
Source: Reuters [edited]
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-italy-deaths/seventh-italian-dies-from-coronavirus-in-europes-worst-flare-up-idUSKCN20I0S8


The death toll in Europe's largest coronavirus outbreak rose to 7 on Monday [24 Feb 2020] and new cases climbed above 220 as Italy shut down much of its wealthy north to curb the disease's spread.

Italian shares tumbled more than 5%, the biggest daily drop in almost 4 years, on worries the flare-up could cause a recession, while worried residents emptied supermarket shelves to stock up on essentials.

Authorities in the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto, the industrial and financial heartlands of Italy, shut schools, universities, museums and cinemas for at least a week, and banned public gatherings including the famed Venice carnival.
10 towns in Lombardy close to Italy's business capital Milan, with a combined population of nearly 50 000, have been placed under effective quarantine, with similar measures adopted for a small town in neighboring Veneto. "To be honest, nobody thought the spread would be so aggressive," Lombardy regional governor Attilio Fontana told 102.5 RTL radio, predicting, however that the virus would regress in days due to the emergency measures.

Local authorities announced 4 new deaths on Monday [24 Feb 2020] - 3 men in their 80s and a 62-year-old. 3 previous fatalities recorded since Friday [24 Feb 2020] were also elderly people. All those who have died had underlying health problems.

Lombardy remained the worst hit region with 172 confirmed cases, while neighboring Veneto had 33 infections, including 4 in Venice, which had been packed with tourists before its carnival was curtailed 2 days ahead of schedule.

At national level, 27 people were in intensive care, 101 hospitalized and 94 being monitored at home, officials said.

Economists warned the disruption would take a heavy toll on local businesses and Italy's blue-chip stock index fell 5.4%, with companies most at risk from an expected spending slump bearing the brunt. Motorway and airport retail group Autogrill plunged 12.7%, while high-street clothing retailer OVS fell 12.9% and luxury goods group Tod's 11.4%.

Italy is the world's 5th most visited country and tourism contributes about 13% to GDP, according to the World Trade and Tourism Council. The sector is already taking a hit. "We have been swamped by cancellations in the last few days, in restaurants, hotels, everywhere," said Patrizio Bertin, the head of the Veneto branch of Italy's trade lobby Confcommercio.

Milan, a city of 1.3 million people, was much quieter than normal. The city's usually bustling courtrooms were deserted, normally packed bars were largely empty and even the city's imposing Gothic cathedral closed its doors. "We were only meant to spend three days in Milan and then go to Venice for the carnival but everything is shut," said a Russian tourist wearing a face mask as she took photographs of the shuttered Duomo cathedral. "I hope we won't have to cut our trip short."

With other countries looking to stop the spread, Mauritius on Monday [24 Feb 2020] told passengers from Lombardy and Veneto just arrived aboard an Alitalia aircraft that they would have to go into quarantine if they wanted to stay. Alitalia said 40 out of the 224 passengers and crew were affected and decided to fly back home immediately. Ireland said its citizens should not travel to parts of Italy affected by the outbreak. Tunisia announced it may suspend some flights to Italy to reduce exposure.

Prior to Friday, Italy had reported just 3 cases of the virus - all of them people who had recently arrived from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the illness emerged late last year [2019].

Health authorities were frustrated by their failure to identify how the outbreak in the north had started. Doctors say the focal point was the cluster of now closed-off towns in Lombardy, with the disease spreading fast as the 1st patients sought hospital attention. However, none of the initial patients had been to China and officials do not know who brought the infection to the area. "By now, identifying 'patient zero' in statistical terms would be a great satisfaction ... but you understand that the situation has evolved and must be handled completely differently," said Lombardy official Giulio Gallera.

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10 a.m. CET.

Highlights
----------
- One new Member State (Kuwait) reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.

- Since the emergence of COVID-19 we have seen instances of public stigmatization among specific populations, and the rise of harmful stereotypes. Stigmatization could potentially contribute to more severe health problems, ongoing transmission, and difficulties controlling infectious diseases during an epidemic. Please see the Subject in Focus section for more information on how to counter stigmatizing attitudes.

Subject in focus: Risk Communications to Address Stigma
Stigma occurs when people negatively associate an infectious disease, such as COVID-19, with a specific population. In the case of COVID-19, there are an increasing number of reports of public stigmatization against people from areas affected by the epidemic. Unfortunately, this means that people are being labelled, stereotyped, separated, and/or experience loss of status and discrimination because of a potential negative affiliation with the disease.

Given that COVID-19 is a new disease, it is understandable that its emergence and spread cause confusion, anxiety and fear among the general public. These factors can give rise to harmful stereotypes.

Stigma can:
- Drive people to hide the illness to avoid discrimination
- Prevent people from seeking health care immediately
- Discourage them from adopting healthy behaviours

Such barriers could potentially contribute to more severe health problems, ongoing transmission, and difficulties controlling infectious diseases during an infectious disease outbreak. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), UNICEF and the WHO are developing community-based guides and global campaigns to thwart the effects of stigma on people and the COVID-19 response.

Do your part. Governments, citizens, media, key influencers and communities have an important role to play in preventing and stopping stigma. We all need to be intentional and thoughtful when communicating on social media and other communication platforms, showing supportive behaviors around COVID-19.

Here are some examples and tips on possible actions to counter stigmatizing attitudes:
• Spreading the facts: Stigma can be heightened by insufficient knowledge about how the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is transmitted and treated, and how to prevent infection.
• Engaging social influencers such as religious leaders on prompting reflection about people who are stigmatized and how to support them, or respected celebrities to amplify messages that reduce stigma.
• Amplify the voices, stories and images of local people who have experienced COVID-19 and have recovered or who have supported a loved one through recovery to emphasise that most people do recover from COVID-19.
• Make sure you portray different ethnic groups. Materials should show diverse communities that are being affected, and show communities working together to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
• Balanced reporting. Media reporting should be balanced and contextualised, disseminating evidence-based information and helping combat rumour and misinformation that could lead to stigmatisation.
• Link up. There are a number of initiatives to address stigma and stereotyping. It is key to link up to these activities to create a movement and a positive environment that shows care and empathy for all.

[The number of countries reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 with transmission occurring outside China is now 20 (Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Viet Nam, Malaysia, Australia, Thailand, USA, France, Germany, Spain, UK, UAE, Italy, Egypt, Iran, Israel, Lebanon, Canada, and Kuwait). There has also been local transmission noted on the cruise ship quarantined in Japan, 1st identified in a quarantine officer, but continued transmission of the coronavirus has most likely been occurring on the ship. More confirmations have been reported from the cruise ship, but in addition confirmations on returning evacuees from the cruise ship have been reported by the USA, UK, Hong Kong and Israel.

The total number of cases reported from outside of China is now 1769 including 17 deaths, with reports coming from 28 countries.

It is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time I've accessed the Johns Hopkins website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. - Mod.MPP]
