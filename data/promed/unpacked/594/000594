Two doctors of the Allied Hospital are said to have contracted chickenpox [varicella] while administering treatment to patients, augmenting the scare among the medics and staff.

More than 10 people, most of them children, have died due to complications they developed while being treated for chickenpox during the last one and-a-half months. The disease is unabated, as the number of patients with similar symptoms is surging.

A 14-year-old [child] died on Fri [7 Apr 2017], a few days after she was admitted to the hospital with fever and other symptoms of chickenpox.

Information gleaned by Dawn said Dr Fareeha and Dr Fazal were suffering from chickenpox, and the situation has alarmed their colleagues and hospital staff. Their colleagues have resented what they say are undue delays in administering vaccinations to the entire workforce.

Sources said that the doctors have been insisting on being vaccinated for the last month. They said the situation indicated an outbreak of the disease.

Speaking to this correspondent, a doctor said chickenpox is usually not alarming, but the situation worsens when parents consult doctors after much delay, and then it becomes difficult to handle the complications. He says the government should launch an awareness campaign to sensitize people about the infectious disease.

Deputy Commissioner Salman Ghani says an awareness campaign is already underway.

Pakistan Medical Association, Punjab Vice President Dr Mohammad Irfan suggested that the hospital administration should immediately examine the doctors, nurses and other staff engaged in treating the chickenpox patients to rule out any other case. He says that people, as a precautionary measure, should isolate the family member who suffers from chickenpox.

Dr Irfan urges the district government to ensure availability of the chickenpox vaccine in Faisalabad [Punjab] because of possible outbreaks of the disease.

Allied Hospital Medical Superintendent Dr Rashid Maqbool said arrangements for immunisation of the staff had been made, and they would be vaccinated soon. He said 3 employees -- a doctor, a nurse, and a paramedic -- were suffering from chickenpox, but they did not contract it from any of those given treatment in the hospital.

Admitting that 11 people had died of chickenpox since 1 Jan 2017 and that more than 10 are still admitted, Dr Maqbool said the hospital was doing its best to properly treat patients.

[According to https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2017/04/08/chicken-pox-death-toll-rises-to-12/, the death toll of the chicken pox epidemic in Faisalabad rose to 12 on Sat [8 Apr 2017]. This report states that around 40 patients including 3 doctors of Allied Hospital have been admitted to hospitals so far. Vaccines for the patients have been unavailable throughout the province's large cities so far.

Meanwhile, hospital officials said that they had contacted the Punjab government for vaccines, which the government says will be available in a few days.

The majority of the patients are minors, but the doctors are more concerned about elderly patients who are more vulnerable. A senior doctor said that the virus could spread throughout the country if solid measures were not taken in time.

Chickenpox resulting from infection with varicella zoster virus (VZV) is one of the most common communicable diseases worldwide. While most cases recover spontaneously with time, some may progress to serious consequences in adults, especially in immunosuppressed individuals. The virus is highly contagious, with an attack rate approaching over 85% after exposure. The vaccine is 70-90% effective. Vaccinated individuals who come down with the disease are generally protected from the most severe symptoms. It is particularly important to vaccinate health care workers, minors, and the elderly to protect those most at risk and prevent spread of infection. - Mod.LK
