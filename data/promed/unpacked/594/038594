High Alert of Preparedness Cancelled
------------------------------------
The high alert of preparedness effective since the mid September, 2010
in 2 eastern provinces due to the spread of food and mouth disease
[FMD] has been cancelled beginning from 1 Dec 2010.

The Government discussed at its last regular meeting on 1 Dec 2010 the
current state in Sukhbaatar and Dornod provinces, where the infectious
FMD outbreak [has been recorded]. Based on an updated report by the
National Emergency Commission saying no more fresh outbreak in the 2
provinces, the Government decided to cancel the high alert of
preparedness.

Though the preparedness alert is called back, authorities of Dornod
and Sukhbaatar should be cautious and take required measures based on
situations in their areas, the government orders.

The outbreak of FMD in Dornod and Sukhbaatar spread to neighboring
provinces of Dornogobi, Khentii, Tuv and Gobisumber. For this period,
the FMD affected some 25 608 heads of livestock, of which 25 595 or
99.5 percent was liquidated.

Some 5 million heads of livestock were vaccinated so far.

[The above information on the termination of the alert stage situation
in Sukhbaatar and Dornod provinces should be viewed as preliminary,
until an official notification is obtained. Similarly, updated
vaccination figures are anticipated, pertaining separately to cattle,
sheep, goats and camelidae (in Mongolia, Bactrian camels). Such
information was included in Mongolia's follow-up reports. According to
the last available follow-up report (Number 4, submitted 24 Nov 2010;
see archived 20101126.4273), the total number of vaccinated animals in
the provinces Dornod, Sukhbaatar and Khentii was 3 597 601.

According to OIE figures, the Mongolian (whole country) animal census
for 2009 was as follows: cattle - 2 579 600, goats - 19 470 500, sheep
- 19 125 200, camelidae - 275 100. - Mod.AS]
