Rabid Bat Confirmed in Marion County; One Person Exposed
--------------------------------------------------------
The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) confirmed a bat found on the ground near North Main Street and Harlee Street in Marion, SC has tested positive for rabies. One person was exposed and has been referred to their healthcare provider.

The bat was submitted to DHEC's laboratory for testing on 16 Aug 2022 and was confirmed to have rabies on 17 Aug 2022.

Never handle a bat or any wild or stray animal, alive or dead, with your bare hands. Any bat which could have had potential contact with people, pets, or livestock should be safely trapped in a sealed container and not touched.

Once a bat is released, it cannot be tested for rabies. Never release a bat which has potentially exposed a person or pet.

"Rabid bats have been known to transmit the rabies virus," said Terri McCollister, Rabies Program Team Leader. "People don't always realize they or a pet have been bitten, since bat teeth are tiny, and bites are easy to overlook. Because of this, you should always assume a person or pet has potentially been bitten when:
- They wake up to find a bat in a room or tent;
- A bat is found where children, pets, or persons with impaired mental capacity (intoxicated or mentally disabled) have been left unattended; or
- They have been in direct contact with a bat."

"Although bats can carry rabies, not every bat is infected with the virus. Bats are an important part of South Carolina's ecosystems and deserve a healthy degree of respect just like all wild animals," said McCollister.

You cannot tell if a bat, or any other animal, has rabies by simply looking at it. Rabies must be confirmed in a laboratory. Unusual behavior in bats that might indicate the animal has rabies includes daytime activity, inability to fly, and being found in places they are not usually seen, like in your home or on your lawn. An exposure is defined as direct contact (such as through broken skin or mucous membranes in the eyes, nose, or mouth) with saliva or brain/nervous system tissue from an infected animal. Be sure to immediately wash any part of your body which may have come in contact with saliva or neural tissue with plenty of soap and water and seek medical attention.

If you believe you, someone you know, or your pets have come in contact with this bat or another animal potentially having rabies, please call DHEC's Environmental Affairs Florence office during normal business hours (8:30 a.m.-5:00 p.m., Monday-Friday) or on the after-hours and holidays number.

It is important to keep pets up to date on their rabies vaccination, as this is one of the easiest and most effective ways to protect against the disease. This bat is the 1st animal in Marion County to test positive for rabies in 2022. There have been 47 cases of rabid animals statewide this year [2022].

Since 2002, South Carolina has averaged approximately 148 positive cases a year. In 2021, 1 of the 101 confirmed rabies cases in South Carolina was in Marion County.

Contact information for your local Environmental Affairs Health offices is available at <www.scdhec.gov/EAoffices>. For more information on rabies, visit <www.scdhec.gov/rabies> or <www.cdc.gov/rabies>.

Cat tests positive for rabies in Dinwiddie County
-------------------------------------------------
A cat tested positive for rabies after charging at a person on Sunday [14 Aug 2022] near Duncan Road in North Dinwiddie County.

Health officials say the domestic female cat was small with short black hair.

"Please notify public health officials or animal control immediately if you live near Duncan Road and think you or your pet(s) had contact with the infected cat," said Crater District Health Department Director Alton Hart Jr. "The community's safety is our priority. Make sure your pets are vaccinated, especially against rabies."

"The Dinwiddie Health Department and Dinwiddie County Animal Control continue to encourage animal owners to confirm all pet vaccinations, especially rabies, are current," the Virginia Department of Health said in a news release.

This is the 2nd cat to test positive for rabies in the area recently.

On Thursday [18 Aug 2022], the Petersburg Bureau of Police posted to social media a rabid cat was found in the Delectable Heights area of the city.

Petersburg Animal Care and Control has set traps for feral cats and other wild animals in the area.

"It is believed many feral animals came in contact with the rabid cat," the City of Petersburg said in a news release.

Virginia Department of Health: Fox Tests Positive for Rabies Virus
------------------------------------------------------------------
The Hampton & Peninsula Health Districts would like to notify our guests and residents that on 22 Aug 2022, multiple fox bites and sightings were reported in the City of Williamsburg, specifically in the areas of Mimosa Drive, Boundary Street, Counselor's Way, and Griffin Avenue. One fox was captured and tested positive for the rabies virus.

Anyone having information regarding an exposure to any fox (bite, scratch or contact with saliva by open wound or eyes, nose, mouth) is asked to contact the Hampton & Peninsula Health Districts' Williamsburg Environmental Health Office. Exposures also include direct contact between your pet and the rabid animal.

After hours, please contact local Animal Control, James City County/Williamsburg Animal Control.

Rabies is a fatal, but preventable, disease carried by mammals and has been in the wild animal population on the Peninsula since the mid 1980's. Our Williamsburg Environmental Health Office staff will be contacting the immediate neighbors, as well as any civic or homeowner's association(s) that serve the communities listed above.

The District would like to remind all citizens to follow these 3 important rabies prevention guidelines:
1. Vaccinate your pets. [And if your pet is exposed, take your pet to a veterinarian immediately - Mod.TG]
2. Report all exposures to animals (usually bites and scratches) to your doctor and the local health department.
3. Enjoy wildlife from a distance - do not feed or encourage wild animals such as raccoons, skunks or foxes to visit your premises.

[5] Washington (Thurston County): bats, multiple people/animals exposed

Cat saves owner from Thurston County's 1st rabies positive bat of 2022
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A cat caught Thurston County's 1st rabies positive-bat of 2022 in its owner's home on Monday [22 Aug 2022]. Thurston County collected the bat on a "particularly busy" Monday [22 Aug 2022] when it responded to 3 separate bat incidents, according to a Wednesday [24 Aug 2022] news release. The bats were found in bedrooms where people were sleeping, according to the release from Public Health and Social Services (PHSS). One of them tested positive at the Washington State Public Health Lab and PHSS received the result late Tuesday [23 Aug 2022].

Though the cat was exposed to rabies, it should survive the duel with the bat. The release says the cat was up to date on its rabies vaccinations and should receive a booster dose for added protection. To ensure the cat remains healthy, its owner will observe their feline friend at home for 45 days.

Those who were exposed to the rabies-positive bat have started preventative vaccinations as well, according to the release.

A dog caught the 2nd bat and residents caught the 3rd bat. Those bats were also tested, but the release indicates the rabies tests were negative.

This is the 4th rabies case detected in Washington state this year [2022]. Three others were detected in Mason, Snohomish and Kittitas counties this summer [2022], according to the state Department of Health.

The state confirmed 12 bats had rabies in 2021, including 1 in Thurston County. In 2020, there were 8 confirmed cases and none in Thurston County.

Bats are the primary animal carrying rabies in Washington state, according to the DOH. Other animals, such as raccoons, skunks, foxes or coyotes, also can carry the virus, but the state has not identified cases in those animals lately.

To avoid rabies exposure, PHSS recommends not handling bats, alive or dead. Pets should also be kept away from bats and be vaccinated against rabies in accordance with state law. "It is not possible to tell if a bat has rabies just from its appearance," the release says. "Whether a bat is alive or dead, handling an infected bat can potentially transfer rabies." If someone finds a bat in their home, PHSS advises capturing the bat so it can be tested.

When the bat lands, residents can place a container over it and slide cardboard under the container to trap it inside, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Anyone who has been bitten or scratched by a bat should wash the area with soap and water and call PHSS during business hours. If calling after business hours or during weekends, PHSS says exposed individuals should call 911. More information on bats and how to bat-proof a home can be found by visiting the Washington state Department of Fish and Wildlife website at https://wdfw.wa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/00605/wdfw00605.pdf.

Dead rabid fox found in N.J. state park which remains closed, officials say
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A dead rabid fox has been found in the Double Trouble State Park in Ocean County, where county health officials say 2 people and a dog were recently bitten by a fox, though state officials believe it is not the same fox involved in recent encounters that prompted the closure of the park.

"A deceased juvenile fox was found Tuesday [30 Aug 2022] in another part of the park and tested positive for rabies on Thursday [1 Sep 2022]," the state Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) said Thursday evening [1 Sep 2022]. "Based on descriptions provided by visitors, it is not believed to be the same animal involved in Monday's [29 Aug 2022] incidents. In addition, the Park Service and Fish & Wildlife have no information at this time of any visitors bitten or scratched by a fox at the park."

A spokesman for the Ocean County Department of Health said the rabid fox was found in the area of Pinewald Keswick Road, which runs through the 8000-acre [3237 ha] state park. The county health office said 2 people and a dog were bitten at the park, though the state DEP said it had no information other than encounters with a potentially rabid fox.

The park was closed for a 4th straight day on Thursday [1 Sep 2022], the state DEP said.

"NJDEP State Park Service and NJDEP Fish & Wildlife continue to monitor Double Trouble State Park in Ocean County for a potentially rabid fox involved in encounters with people and a dog on Monday [29 Aug 2022]," the DEP said in a statement online Thursday evening [1 Sep 2022]. "The park remains closed until further notice."

In addition to the Double Trouble incidents, 5 children were bitten by another fox suspected of having rabies about 15 miles [24 km] away in Lakewood.

Two kids were bitten in a Lakewood park in separate incidents while 3 other children were bitten in a yard. A Lakewood police spokesman said Thursday afternoon [1 Sep 2022] he was not aware of any additional attacks.

That fox is also suspected of having rabies, the county health department spokesman said.

Anyone bitten by a fox -- or any wildlife -- should get immediate medical attention and notify police and their local health department, authorities said. People should not approach wildlife especially if an animal is demonstrating atypical behavior such as general sickness, being overly aggressive or even appearing friendly and/or tamer.

Most wildlife are skittish around humans. Other signs of an infected animal are heavy drooling, circling or wobbling, a health department spokesman said.

[The article where many individuals were exposed or potentially exposed to rabies is a warning we should all be vigilant, even near our homes.

These articles should serve as a warning to all of us to have our homes and attics checked. Bats can make it through very small spaces and into our homes. Tiny holes in window screens can also serve as a place of ingress to the dwelling. Our elderly especially may be unaware of some noises or cracks in a roof or ceiling or window screen. We need to be checking on our older family, friends, and neighbors, keeping an eye for bats. Even if we are enjoying an evening outside we should be aware of bats.

Rabies is a deadly disease when untreated in human beings. It is also deadly for our unvaccinated pets. Please vaccinate your pets and follow your veterinarian's recommendations on the interval between vaccinations. Please protect yourself and your pets. Protecting your pet with vaccinations can build a barrier between you and the disease.

Wild animals can come at us, or our pets, at very unexpected moments in places we may think are safe. The only way to build the barrier of protection is to vaccinate your pets, and report any bites you receive.

If you are bitten, wash the wound with soap and water and seek medical attention. The post-exposure prophylaxis treatment must be given within a short time from the bite. It is very effective and can save your life.

"In the United States, PEP consists of a regimen of one dose of immune globulin and 4 doses of the rabies vaccine over a 14-day period. Rabies immune globulin and the 1st dose of rabies vaccine should be given by your healthcare provider as soon as possible after exposure. Current vaccines are relatively painless and are given in your arm like the flu or tetanus vaccines; rabies vaccines are not given in the stomach." (https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/exposure/index.html)

"Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) consists of a dose of human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) and rabies vaccine given on the day of the rabies exposure, and then a dose of vaccine given again on days 3, 7, and 14. For people who have never been vaccinated against rabies previously, PEP should always include administration of both HRIG and rabies vaccine. The combination of HRIG and vaccine is recommended for both bite and non-bite exposures, regardless of the interval between exposure and initiation of treatment.

"People who have been previously vaccinated or are receiving preexposure vaccination for rabies should receive only vaccine.

"Adverse reactions to rabies vaccine and immune globulin are not common. Newer vaccines in use today cause fewer adverse reactions than previously available vaccines. Mild, local reactions to the rabies vaccine, such as pain, redness, swelling, or itching at the injection site, have been reported. Rarely, symptoms such as headache, nausea, abdominal pain, muscle aches, and dizziness have been reported. Local pain and low-grade fever may follow injection of rabies immune globulin.

"The vaccine should be given at recommended intervals for best results. Talk to your doctor or state or local public health officials if you will not be able to have your shots at the recommended interval. Rabies prevention is a serious matter, and changes should not be made in the schedule of doses. Patient assistance programs that provide medications to uninsured or underinsured patients are available for rabies vaccine and immune globulin.

"People cannot transmit rabies to other people unless they themselves are sick with rabies. PEP will protect you from developing rabies, and therefore you cannot expose other people to rabies. You can continue to participate in your normal activities." (https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/medical_care/index.html) - Mod.TG
