The country location indicated in ProMED-mail post Yellow fever - Africa(37): Democratic Republic of the Congo was incorrect. This report is from the Republic of the Congo, NOT the DRC. ProMEd regrets the error and any inconvenience it may have caused.

ProMED thanks Richard Luce and Sabue Mulangu for bringing this error to our attention.

There was one case of yellow fever in the same department, Cuvette Ouest that occurred on 28 Jan 2009 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20090507.1712). Sylvan yellow fever virus is no doubt endemic there.
