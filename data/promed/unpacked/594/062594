[With the addition of these 3 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, there are now 9 newly confirmed cases of the disease reported by Saudi Arabia since 1 Sep 2018. Two of the 3 newly confirmed cases are secondary household contacts of previously confirmed cases, one in Riyadh city (Riyadh region) and one in Buraidah (Al Qasim region), and the 3rd case is a primary community acquired case with known identified contact with camels or other previously confirmed cases. In addition to reports of these 3 newly confirmed cases, there was an update on the status of a previously confirmed case, having been discharged from the hospital and now on home isolation.

According to my spreadsheets (based on reported cases and recoveries from the Saudi MOH MERS-CoV case reports and from the WHO updates based on MOH reports (from all countries reporting cases), there have been a total of 1881 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by Saudi Arabia since 2012, including 756 deaths, bringing the reported case fatality rate in Saudi Arabia to 40.2.

Health authorities said Sunday [16 Sep 2018] that no additional cases of the Middle East respiratory syndrome have been reported since the country's 1st case in 3 years was reported last Saturday [8 Sep 2018].

The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said 14 people who came in contact with the 1st patient and showed MERS-related symptoms all tested negative for the highly infectious disease.

Also, 21 people who came in close contact with patient zero all tested negative last Thursday [20 Sep 2018].

The KCDC plans to test them again on Thursday [20 Sep 2018], before the maximum incubation period ends. The incubation period for MERS ranges from 2 days to 14 days.

Meanwhile, a Saudi Arabian man who entered South Korea on Saturday [15 Sep 2018] from Dubai and showed symptoms of fever and coughing was sent to the National Medical Center but tested negative for the disease.

[So far so good in South Korea. We have learned from a reliable source that the response at the 1st hospital where this suspected case was seen was to put the patient in an isolation room as soon as identified as a suspected case, prior to getting laboratory results, thereby reducing the exposure of other medical staff, patients and family members in the emergency room.
