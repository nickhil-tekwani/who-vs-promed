_Staphylococcus aureus_ is both a commensal colonizing organism of the skin and upper respiratory tract and a human pathogen, responsible for causing a wide range of infections ranging from fairly benign skin and soft tissue infections to life-threatening conditions such as bacteremia and endocarditis. _S. aureus_ is an uncommon cause of urinary tract infection in the general population, accounting for 0.4%-4% of positive urine cultures (1-3).

_S. aureus_ bacteriuria (SABU) is more common among patients with indwelling urinary tract catheters or prior urinary tract instrumentation (4) and may only reflect urinary tract colonization in asymptomatic individuals. However, when isolated from urine without an obvious urinary focus, SABU can be a marker of hematogenous seeding of the urinary tract, with an estimated prevalence of 7%-16% in patients with _S. aureus_ bloodstream infection (SABSI) (5-7). _S. aureus_ bloodstream infection from a urinary tract source (SABSI-UTS) is an infrequent complication of _S. aureus_ urinary tract infection, accounting for only 3%-6% of patients with SABSI (8,9). Interpreting the frequency of SABSI-UTS has been challenging given difficulties in attributing an episode of SABSI to a urinary tract source and variation in defining this syndrome.

Grillo and colleagues [see reference citation below] conducted a multicentered retrospective cohort study of adult patients hospitalized with SABSI to determine characteristics and 30-day mortality of patients with SABSI-UTS (10). In this study, investigators defined SABSI as the presence of at least one positive blood culture obtained in a patient with signs and symptoms of infection. SABSI-UTS was diagnosed in patients with SABSI and the presence of urinary tract signs/symptoms, the lack of plausible extra-urinary source of infection, and a urinary culture growing 105 or more colony-forming units/mL.

Of 4181 episodes of SABSI, investigators identified 132 (3.16%) cases of SABSI-UTS, similar to estimates of prior studies (8,9). Of patients with SABSI-UTS, 116 (87.9%) were men, median age was 70 years, and median Charlson comorbidity score was 5 points. A total of 104 (78.7%) of infections were classified as being nosocomial or health care-associated, whereas 28 (21.2%) of infections were community-acquired. Indwelling urinary catheters were present in 94 (71.2%) patients, and urinary manipulation (e.g., catheter change, urinary surgical intervention) occurred in 85 (64.4%) of patients prior to onset of SABSI, with a median time from manipulation to bacteremia of 9 days.

Susceptibility of _S. aureus_ strains and 30-day patient mortality, defined as death due to any cause within 30 days after onset of bacteremia, were compared between patients with SABSI-UTS versus patients with SABSI from another source. The investigators found that SABSI-UTS was more often caused by methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA) as compared with SABSI from a non-urinary tract source (40.9% vs 17.5%, P less than 0.001). The 30-day mortality was significantly lower in patients with SABSI-UTS as compared with patients with SABSI from a non-urinary tract source (14.4% vs 23.8%, P = 0.02). Patients with SABSI-UTI caused by MRSA received adequate empiric antibiotic therapy less frequently as compared with those with methicillin-susceptible strains (40.3% vs 79.6%, P less than 0.001); however, there was no significant difference in mortality between groups (18.5% [10 of 54] mortality in MRSA vs 11.5% [9 of 78] mortality in MSSA, P = 0.261). A difference in mortality between groups may not have been detected due to small sample size and small number of deaths.

On multivariate analysis, patients who were dependent for activities of daily living (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 3.9; 95% CI, 1.2-13.8) or had persistent bacteremia, defined as bacteremia duration 3 or more days after appropriate antimicrobial therapy (AOR, 7.9; 95% CI,1.6-39.5), had increased odds of 30-day mortality after adjusting for age over 70 years and Charlson comorbidity score greater than 5 points.

The findings from this study have important implications for patient care. Although rare, clinicians should recognize that _S. aureus_ bloodstream infection can be directly attributable to the urinary tract. Recent urinary catheterization and/or urinary tract manipulation can be risk factors for development of _S. aureus_ urinary tract infection and subsequent bloodstream infection. As MRSA was the cause in 40% of SABI-UTI [SABSI-UTS?], clinicians should consider empiric MRSA coverage for patients with possible _S. aureus_ bloodstream infection from the urinary tract. Finally, this study highlights another reason for the importance of reducing use of urinary catheterization and manipulation to only individuals with a clear indication for this.

Background: _Staphylococcus aureus_ bloodstream infection (SABSI) arising from a urinary tract source (UTS) is poorly understood.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis in 3 major teaching hospitals in Spain of prospectively collected data of hospitalized patients with SABSI. SABSI-UTS was diagnosed in patients with urinary tract symptoms and/or signs, no evidence of an extra-urinary source of infection, and a urinary _S. aureus_ count of 105 or more cfu/mL. Susceptibility of _S. aureus_ strains and patient mortality were compared between SABSI from UTS (SABSI-UTS) and other sources (SABSI-other).

Results: Of 4181 episodes of SABSI, we identified 132 (3.16%) cases of SABSI-UTS that occurred predominantly in patients who were male, had high Charlson comorbidity scores, were dependent for daily life activities, and who had undergone urinary catheterization and/or urinary manipulation before the infection. SABSI-UTS was more often caused by MRSA strains compared with SABSI-other (40.9% vs 17.5%; P less than 0.001). Patients with SABSI-UTS caused by MRSA more often received inadequate empirical treatment compared with those caused by susceptible strains (59.7% vs 23.1%; P less than 0.001). The 30-day case fatality rate was lower in patients with SABSI-UTS than in those with SABSI-other (14.4% vs 23.8%; P = 0.02). Factors independently associated with mortality were dependence for daily activities (aOR, 3.877; 95% CI, 1.08-13.8; P = 0.037) and persistent bacteremia (aOR, 7.88; 95% CI, 1.57-39.46; P = 0.012).

Conclusions: SABSI-UTS occurs predominantly in patients with severe underlying conditions and in those who have undergone urinary tract manipulation. Moreover, it is frequently due to MRSA strains and causes significant mortality.

_Staphylococcus aureus_ bacteremia (SAB), that is, the presence of staphylococci circulating in the bloodstream, usually indicates an uncontrolled staphylococcal infection in an organ that has spilled over into the bloodstream. SAB is a life-threatening disease that carries a 30-day all-cause mortality rate of 20% and an infection-related mortality rate estimated at approximately 13% (https://cmr.asm.org/content/25/2/362.long#ref-164). SAB tends to be complicated by endovascular, deep-seated, and metastatic infections that require prolonged antimicrobial therapy.

The referenced journal article above reports SAB that is secondary to an _S. aureus_ urinary tract source in a series of 132 adult patients seen at 3 tertiary teaching hospitals in Spain and compares these patients with patients with SAB secondary to a non-urinary source. Patients with a urinary tract source more frequently had undergone urinary catheterization (such as nephrostomy, urethral catheterization, ureteral stent, suprapubic cystostomy) or other type of urinary tract manipulation before their infection, and their infections were more frequently caused by MRSA strains, which were presumably nosocomially acquired, compared with SAB due to other causes.

Persistent SAB, defined as positive blood cultures for _S. aureus_ at 3 or more days, occurred in 9 of the 132 patients. Echocardiography is reported to have been done in 40 patients who had persistent bacteremia, as well as in those with cardiac anomalies and/or with intravascular devices, likely to rule out a diagnosis of endocarditis, in part because persistent positive blood cultures at day 3 of appropriate therapy have previously been reported to be an independent risk factor for endocarditis (http://www.antimicrobe.org/hisphoto/history/Medicine-Chang%20et%20al-S%20aureus%20bacteremia%20Endocarditis%20Meth%20Resist-2003.pdf). However, no patient in this series was reported to have developed endocarditis during follow-up.

Nevertheless, it should be remembered that _S. aureus_ bacteriuria is unusual, and in the absence of predisposing urologic conditions (e.g., urinary tract catheterization or recent urological surgical procedures), _S. aureus_ bacteriuria may be an indication that the patient has underlying endocarditis. - Mod.ML
