The chilli crop in Nagpur and Amravati [districts of Maharashtra] is reported to have been hit by a virus. The infection may bring the yield down by almost 50 per cent. Even growers in Madhya Pradesh have been hit, where the crisis is reported to be worse [and] the crop expected to be down to 30 per cent.

The state's agriculture department said there had been an attack of the churda-murda virus. Around 50 000 hectares [about 124 000 acres] area in Nagpur are under chilli cultivation [and] growers [are] reporting heavy losses.

[Chilli leaf curl, locally known as 'murda', is the most destructive disease of chilli crops in India and Sri Lanka. The term is used specifically in chili for disease symptoms including leaf distortion, chlorosis, and necrosis, as well as stunting of plants and failure to produce fruit. It is a disease complex which is thought to involve feeding damage by chilli thrips (_Scirtothrips dorsalis_) and broad mite (_Polyphagotarsonemus latus_), as well as several viruses including at least one whitefly transmitted leaf curl virus and probably one or more _Tospovirus_ species. Secondary fungal or bacterial infections via the feeding wounds may also occur. Disease management relies mainly on systemic insecticides, and resistant chilli varieties are being developed.
