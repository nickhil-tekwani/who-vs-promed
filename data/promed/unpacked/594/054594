I appreciate the moderator's comments about EHD in Indiana and Kentucky.
My original comments were made to the local media specifically about
bluetongue and were intended to quell a firestorm of phone calls about a
reported bluetongue outbreak. Clinical bluetongue has not been diagnosed in
Indiana for years and carries some of the cachet of an exotic disease.
EHD, as noted by the moderator, is fairly common in Southern Indiana and
has been quite prevalent this fall [2007], and many large animal
veterinarians in the area are now familiar with the clinical signs of
EHD-infected cattle. In our experience, EHD afflicts cattle sporadically,
usually affecting only a few animals in a herd with signs of lethargy,
stiffness, fever, hypersalivation, anorexia, and weight loss. Physical exam
usually reveals erosion of the nasal planum [perhaps palate], gingivitis,
stomatitis, teat erosions, and sometimes coronary band hyperemia. Although
affected animals can look pretty rough, they usually recover within a few
days to a few weeks. Rare deaths occur, usually involving secondary
complications and usually after a prolonged period of illness.
The report in question involved 14 apparently healthy cattle in a herd of
21 that suddenly sickened and died in a 36 hour period. Only 7 immature
animals remained alive and unaffected.
These details were apparently lost as the news report got condensed. This
sudden massive death loss is not the epidemiologic pattern that we are
accustomed to seeing with bovine EHD. Nor is it the pattern that has been
described in the bluetongue outbreaks in Europe. Nor is it the pattern that
we typically see with anaplasmosis, which has also been prevalent this year
[2007]. The epidemiologic pattern is much more suggestive of a point-source
exposure to some toxin or other acutely noxious agent, and our
investigation is moving in that direction. At this point, we have found no
evidence of infectious disease that would be a threat to neighboring farms,
and we suspect the deaths are due to a farm-specific event. Hopefully, we
will be able to provide more specific details in the near future.

[We appreciate Dr. Murphy writing to correct the errors in the news
posting. Indeed, under the situation he describes, this would have to be a
much more local focus, primarily of the production site itself. I will
avoid speculating on things it could be as the below posting removes all
doubts as to the cause of the loss. - Mod.TG]

This is a follow-up to the comments that I sent to ProMED-mail earlier
regarding the undiagnosed deaths of cattle in Clark County Indiana, USA.
Preliminary investigation suggests that these cattle died of grain
overload/rumen acidosis following accidental exposure to a large quantity
of raw soybeans. A number of diagnostic tests are still pending, but we do
not expect the results to significantly alter this preliminary diagnosis.
