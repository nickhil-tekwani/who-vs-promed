In reference to information provided in the report from El Mercurio and
quoted in the ProMED-mail post entitled: Leptospirosis-Ecuador (02) dated
Feb 09, hope the following will be of some assistance:
a. Between 29 January and today (February 11, 1998) a total of 37 suspected
cases (febrile with icteric-haemorragic manifestations) have been reported.
Twenty-eight (28) are from Guayas Province (where Guayaquil is located).
Additionally, there have been suspected cases reported from the Provinces
of Manabi(3), Los Rios(1), Canar (1), El Oro (1) and three cases about whom
information on place of residence is not yet available.
b. Based on microagglutination for leptospirosis and IgM for dengue,
results for 24 of these cases, provided by the National Institute of Health
(INH) in Guayaquil, reveal 9 cases of leptospirosis, 1 mixed case of
_Plasmodium vivax_ malaria and leptospirosis, 2 cases of dengue and 12
negative results for leptospirosis. Results for 13 cases [are not yet
available.
c. Six (6) of the ten (10) positive leptospirosis cases reported by INH are
from Guayas Province, the mixed _P. vivax_/leptospirosis case is from
Manabi Province (north of Guayas), 1 from Los Rios Province and two for
whom residence data is not presently available. The two cases of dengue are
from Guayas Province.
d. Ten of the thirty seven (37) suspected cases have died. Of these, three
(3) had positive results for leptospirosis and there were 6 negative
results for leptospirosis. No additional laboratory data available.
e. Twenty five (25) suspected cases and six (6) positive leptospirosis
cases among males. Four (4) of twelve (12) females positive for
leptospirosis.
f. All positive cases, except one 10 year old male, above 18 years of age.
g. To date, results from the INH indicate _L. icterohemorrhagiae_, _L.
canicola_, _L. shermani_, _L. castelloni_, _L. djasiman_ among the positive
cases.
h. Sera of first suspected cases, among whom leptospirosis and dengue
