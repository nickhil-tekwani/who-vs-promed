Rio Grande do Sul is facing the 2nd worst outbreak of bovine rabies since the decade of the 1980s, when the disease spread in the state. With 23 foci detected just between January and March [2012] in 12 municipalities in the South region, the Secretariat of Agriculture estimates that 1400 animals have died of the virus [infection], transmitted by hematophagous bats [_Desmodus rotundus_]. In all of 2011, there were 43 foci. Given the severity of the situation, the Secretariat has intensified the search for roosts, the capture [of bats] and fight against the bats. Just in March [2012], 1072 [vampire bats] were captured. The radius of action where foci are registered has also been expanded from 12-20 km [7-12 miles].

Today [17 Apr 2012], 7 of the new control nuclei [teams] are in the South. The taskforce involves 14 veterinarians and auxiliary personnel as well as provincial veterinarians and animal scientists. The group also carries out public education work in the municipalities through meetings. The Coordinator of the National Program for the Control of Rabies in the state, Nilton Rossato, is confident that the outbreak can be controlled in 2-3 months without spread. But the social damage is already great, because the incidence is [high] in small farms.

According to Rossato, it all began this past May of last year [2011], after the floods of the Sao Lourenco do Sul dislocated the bats. The specialist explained that normally between 15-20 per cent of a [bat] colony -- composed of up to 500 bats -- is incubating the virus. The virus [infection] manifests itself when there is a reduction in immunity, triggered by stress factors such as runoff [floods]. High temperatures and low humidity indices recorded last summer [2011] aggravated the situation.

The main difficulty now, stated Rossato, is the lack of cooperation by the producers. In addition to vaccination of their cattle, they need information about the locality for their calves on their properties. Rossato stressed that this is the only way to combat the disease and reduce its prevalence. He emphasized that there is no cure for rabies, which ends in death of cattle in up to 5 days after symptoms appear, after an incubation period that can reach 60 days. "Many producers claim to be involved in harvesting crops, which is their main activity. And they only vaccinate their cattle after a neighbor's [animal] dies, but then it's too late," he lamented. According to Rossato, losses can be avoided with a negligible investment. He stated that a dose of [rabies] vaccine costs R 0.80 [USD 0.43], while the loss of a milk cow or an ox has a value varying between R800-1200 [USD 425-638].

[This area appears to be endemic for vampire bat-transmitted rabies. As the report notes, the cost of vaccine is low, and the prevention of just one bovine fatality more than compensates for the cost and effort of its application. Ongoing public education is essential, especially in the case of small or marginal farmers.
