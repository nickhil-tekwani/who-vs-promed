Bovine spongiform encephalopathy in Canada
------------------------------------------
Follow-up report No. 3 (final report)
See also: 13 June 2003, 6 June 2003, 23 May 2003
Information received on 12 August 2003 from Dr Brian Evans, executive
director, Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Ottawa:
End of previous report period: 11 June 2003 (see Disease Information 2003;
16(24): 143, 13 June).
End of this report period: 12 August 2003.
On 20 May 2003, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) commenced a
comprehensive investigation into a single case of bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE) reported in the province of Alberta. This case was
detected as part of Canada's ongoing BSE surveillance program instituted in
1992.
The active phase of the investigation was completed in July and resulted in
18 quarantines including 1700 cattle in 2 lines of inquiry, trace forwards
and the feed investigation. Cattle from all 18 farms have been destroyed,
along with an additional 1000 cattle from 36 trace-out premises in Alberta
and Saskatchewan. In total, over 2000 samples were tested, with negative
results. To date, the incidence of BSE in Canada remains confined to one
cow, which did not enter the human food chain.
The epidemiological investigation fully considered all potential avenues of
introduction or expression of the disease including imported versus
indigenous animal origin, maternal transmission, spontaneous or genetic
mutation, contaminated feed source, species cross-over of other known
animal transmissible encephalopathies and an agro-terrorism event.
It is the considered opinion of the Government of Canada that the animal
was born in Canada and was exposed to a contaminated feed source early in
its life prior to the feed ban introduced in 1997. The most likely source
of contamination of the feed was asymptomatic animals imported into North
America from the United Kingdom between 1982 and 1989 that entered the food
chain through natural attrition.
Further details on the investigation and response to BSE in Western Canada
can be found on the CFIA's website
<http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/anima/heasan/disemala/bseesb/bseesbindexe.shtml>.
An independent international team of experts from the public and animal
health community of three continents reviewed and validated the findings of
the investigation. The experts applauded the investigation as unprecedented
in scope and rapidity and having been achieved because of the
infrastructure already in place to respond to such unforeseen events. A
copy of their report, entitled "Report on actions taken by Canada in
response to the confirmation of an indigenous case of BSE", can also be
found on the CFIA's website
<http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/anima/heasan/disemala/bseesb/internate.shtml>.
On 24 July 2003, the Government of Canada amended the Food and Drug
Regulations and the Health of Animals Regulations to prevent specified risk
material (SRM) from entering the human food supply. Enhanced targeted
surveillance to further confirm the absence of the disease is also being
put in place, and adjustments to the current feed restrictions in place
since 1997 remain under consideration.
On 8 August 2003, after having thoroughly reviewed the scientific evidence
and weighed many factors as it evaluated potential risks, including the
preventive measures that Canada had in place prior to the detection of BSE,
such as import controls, feed bans and surveillance measures conducted at
levels that met or exceeded the OIE standards, the United States Department
of Agriculture determined that the risk to public health was extremely low
and consequently partially lifted its ban on Canadian beef. Discussions
will begin immediately with Canada's main trading partner aimed at an
eventual resumption of trade of live ruminants and other still banned
ruminant products. On 11 August 2003, Mexico similarly opened its border.
The CFIA, through additional surveillance and measures taken at slaughter,
continues to be committed to the highest possible quality standards in
animal and public health protection and disease reporting.

[This final OIE report contains valuable additional references to a report
by outside experts from Switzerland and the United States. It is worth
looking at because it highlights the nature of the transparency the
Canadian Food Inspection Agency has nurtured concerning this single case of
BSE. The kudos CFIA has received comes from a conscious effort to be
effective risk communicators in all the dimensions required. In this
instance, as with every serious public health risk, actions speak louder
than words. However, trust and accuracy were evident in the ways risk was
communications as this
situation evolved. The payoff comes when confidence in the food supply is
restored because of good communication. As we look around the world to some
other countries where BSE has occurred, we realize just how far the
Canadians have come in their approach to risk communication. - Mod.PC]
