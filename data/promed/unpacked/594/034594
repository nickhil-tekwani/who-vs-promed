The strain of _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- linked to pork that has infected 134 people in Washington, hospitalizing 16, is multi-drug resistant.

According to an update posted Friday evening, 14 Aug 2015, by the CDC, antimicrobial resistance testing conducted on clinical isolates from 3 infected people found that the organism was resistant to ampicillin, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, and tetracycline. Antimicrobial resistance may be associated with increased risk of hospitalization, development of a bloodstream infection, or treatment failure in patients.

CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory continues to conduct antibiotic resistance testing on additional clinical isolates, and results will be reported when they are available.

Earlier this week, Kapowsin Meats recalled 116 262 pounds of whole hogs that may be contaminated with the outbreak strain.

[The outbreak organism's antimicrobial resistance pattern is now reported. Without resistance to the fluoroquinolones or to ceftriaxone, 2 of the major therapeutic agents for salmonellosis would still be useful. It is, however, useful to recall that a great majority of cases of salmonellosis do not require specific therapy and are often resolved before the identification of the organism is made. - Mod.LL
