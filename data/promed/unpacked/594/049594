There were 134 dengue fever including 20 dengue hemorrage fever (DHF) cases
reported in Sarawak through July 3 1997, as compared to 72 cases including
seven DHF cases in the same period last year.
Health director Dr. Haji Mohd Taha bin Arif disclosed in a press statement
here yesterday that of the 134 cases, Kuching recorded 24 cases, Sibu (39),
Miri (20), Sarikei (20), Bintulu (20), Samarahan (8), Sri Aman (3) and Kapit
(1) [total = 135 -- Mod CHC. The greatest number of cases recorded (31) was
during the month of April.
Dr. Haji Mohd also said the department has identified the affected areas
namely Kuching (Taman Malihah, Jalan Keretapi), Sibu (Bawang Assan, Francis
Kiai, Nanga Singat, Sarawak Moulding Industries), Miri (Kampung Cina, Marudi,
Long Banyok, Baram), Sarekei (Sungai Kesa), Samarahan (SRK Rayang, Serian,
Kampung Tarat Mawang) and Bintulu (Sg Plan Squatters, Tanjung Kidurong,
Kampung Sibiew, Bintulu).
On compounds issued to errant public (those home-owners or premise owners
found to have breeding _Aedes_ mosquitoes in dirty compounds), Dr. Mohd said
596 summons have been issued since the first six months of this year, while
903 written warnings have been issued over the same period.
However, he stressed that from July 15, no warning will be given and
offenders will be automatically compounded [restricted to their compounds?
