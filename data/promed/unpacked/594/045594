2000/139 Epidemiological studies on _Apiosporina morbosa_ on sour cherry
---------------------------------------
_Apiosporina morbosa_ (EPPO A1 quarantine pest) is widely distributed on
sour cherry (_Prunus cerasus_) in southern Ontario, Canada. It can
significantly reduce production in important sour cherry-growing areas. In
Ontario, studies [to determine the best timing for fungicide applications]
were carried out in sour cherry orchards on the relationships between
ascospore discharge from excised black knots and environmental conditions.
Ascospore discharge was monitored over several periods (May 92 and 93,
March, April, May 94 and 95). Results showed that the release of ascospores
depended on rainfall and temperature, but not on wetness duration. Peak
ascospore release occurred from May to mid or late June. Large ascospore
release followed precipitation of at least 10 mm at a temperature of at
least 11 C. Maximum [discharge] occurred at 17 C, and at any given
temperature, [and it] increased with increasing amount of rainfall.
