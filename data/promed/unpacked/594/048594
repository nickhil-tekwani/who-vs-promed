The coronavirus vaccine made by Pfizer-BioNTech is much less effective in preventing infection in children ages 5-11 years than in older adolescents or adults, according to a large new set of data collected by health officials in New York State -- a finding that has deep ramifications for these children and their parents.

The Pfizer vaccine is the only COVID shot authorized for that age-group in the United States. It still prevents severe illness in the children but offers virtually no protection against infection, even within a month after full immunization, the data, which were collected during the omicron surge, suggest.

The sharp drop in the vaccine's performance in young children may stem from the fact that they receive one-third the dose given to older children and adults, researchers and federal officials who have reviewed the data said. The findings, which were posted online on Monday [28 Feb 2022], come on the heels of clinical trial results indicating that the vaccine fared poorly in children aged 2-4 years, who received an even smaller dose.

Experts worried that the news would further dissuade hesitant parents from immunizing their children. Other studies have shown the vaccine was not powerfully protective against infection with the omicron variant in adults, either. "It's disappointing, but not entirely surprising, given this is a vaccine developed in response to an earlier variant," said Eli Rosenberg, deputy director for science at the New York State Department of Health, who led the study. "It looks very distressing to see this rapid decline, but it's again all against omicron."

Still, he and other public health experts said they recommend the shot for children given the protection against severe disease shown even in the new data set. "We need to make sure we emphasize the doughnut and not the hole," said Dr. Kathryn M. Edwards, a pediatric vaccine expert at Vanderbilt University.

In their study, Dr. Rosenberg and his colleagues analyzed data from 852 384 newly fully vaccinated children aged 12-17 years and 365 502 children aged 5-11 years between 13 Dec 2021 and 31 Jan 2022, the height of the omicron surge.

The vaccine's effectiveness against hospitalization declined to 73% from 85% in the older children. In the younger children, effectiveness dropped to 48% from 100%. But because few children were hospitalized, these estimates have wide margins of error.

The numbers for protection from infection are more reliable. Vaccine effectiveness against infection in the older children decreased to 51% from 66%. But in the younger children, it dropped sharply to just 12% from 68%.

The numbers change drastically between ages 11 and 12. During the week ending 30 Jan 2022, the vaccine's effectiveness against infection was 67% in 12-year-olds but just 11% in 11-year-old children. "The difference between the 2 age-groups is striking," said Florian Krammer, an immunologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.

The biological difference between the 2 ages is likely to be minimal, but while 12-year-old children got 30 micrograms of the vaccine -- the same dose given to adults -- children who were 11 received only 10 micrograms, he noted. "This is super interesting because it would almost suggest that it's the dose that makes the difference," he added. "The question is how to fix that."

There have been at least 851 deaths involving COVID-19 in children under 17, and nearly 7000 cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, a rare but serious condition associated with COVID. More children were hospitalized during the omicron surge than at any other point in the pandemic.

The findings underscore the need to gather more information on the best dose, number and timing for the shots given to children, Dr. Rosenberg said. They also underscore vaccines as just one measure of protection from the virus, along with masks and social distancing, he said.

Dr. Rosenberg's research was posted just days after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released new recommendations that would allow the majority of Americans to stop wearing masks, including in schools. The new data also raise important questions about the Biden administration's strategy for vaccinating children. Only about 1 in 4 children aged 5-11 years has received 2 doses of the vaccine. (The CDC has not yet recommended booster doses for this age-group.)

The vaccine has not yet been authorized for children younger than 5. Scientific advisers to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were scheduled to meet on 15 Feb 2022 to evaluate 2 doses of the vaccine for the youngest children, while 3 doses were still being tested. But the meeting was postponed after Pfizer submitted additional data suggesting 2 doses were not strongly protective against the omicron variant of the virus.

Dr. Rosenberg briefed top CDC officials, including Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, the agency's director, with findings in early February [2022]. FDA leaders learned of the data around the same time. Some federal scientists pushed for the data to be made public ahead of the FDA expert meeting scheduled for 15 Feb 2022, viewing it as highly relevant to the discussion about dosing in children under 5, federal officials and others familiar with their responses to it said.

The data are generally consistent with a report from Britain showing that vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infection in adolescents aged 12-17 years drops to 23% after 2 months. The CDC has been compiling its own data on the vaccine's effectiveness in younger children and is expected to release at least some of it as early as this week, according to people familiar with the agency's plans.

Israeli researchers have also been assessing the vaccine's performance in young children since the country made it available to them in November [2021]. "We continue to study and assess real-world data from the vaccine," Amy Rose, a spokeswoman for Pfizer, said in response to queries about the new data.
Dr. Philip Krause, who recently retired from the FDA as a senior vaccine regulator, said assumptions about certain antibody levels being predictive of vaccine effectiveness should be re-evaluated in light of the new results. "It certainly weakens the argument for mandating that people get that lower dose," he said.

It is not unusual for experts to revisit the dosing and interval for pediatric vaccines as more evidence becomes available. But in this case, giving the children a higher dose to kick up the immune response may not be an option because some data suggest that it may cause too many fevers, an unwelcome and potentially dangerous side effect in young children.

There are other alternatives that may improve immunity in young children, said Deepta Bhattacharya, an immunologist at the University of Arizona.

Pfizer and BioNTech are testing a 3rd dose in children under 5, as well as in those aged 5-11, with the idea that, as in adults, an extra shot may significantly augment immunity. Results from these trials are expected in several weeks. Studies in adults suggest that 3 doses of the vaccine were more protective against the omicron variant than 2 doses.

Dr. Bhattacharya said he and his wife spaced the 2 doses for their children, who are 8 and 10, by 8 weeks rather than the currently recommended 3, based on studies suggesting that a longer gap between doses may improve protection. The CDC last week encouraged some people older than 12, especially boys and men between 12-39 years, to wait 8 weeks between the 1st and 2nd shot.

Another option may be a version of the vaccine designed to thwart the omicron variant, or one that has a mix of several variants. Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson and Johnson are all testing omicron-specific versions of their vaccines.

The next variant may differ widely from omicron, much as omicron did from the delta variant. But training the body to recognize multiple versions would still offer a better chance at preventing infection with newer forms of the virus. "Deciding when and how best to update these vaccines, I think that's really still the key conversation going forward here," Dr. Bhattacharya said.

Newer vaccines that use different approaches than the ones currently authorized in the United States may also work better for children. A protein-based vaccine made by Novavax is under review at the FDA, and the pharmaceutical companies Sanofi and GSK said this month [February 2022] that they plan to submit their vaccine for evaluation soon.

Many parents want to vaccinate their children to prevent them from spreading the virus to vulnerable relatives, to keep them in school or to avoid the possibility of long COVID, the poorly understood set of lingering symptoms that can occur even after a mild infection. Experts acknowledged that the vaccine's low effectiveness against infection does not ease those concerns.

Still, the vaccines "provide more protection than we think," said Jessica Andriesen, a vaccine data expert at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. "They may also make it so that your kid who brings home COVID isn't shedding virus as much as they would be if they weren't vaccinated, and they also may have it for a shorter amount of time," she said.

The virus is here to stay, and children's risk of severe outcomes increases with age. So inoculating children early is a good idea, said Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and an adviser to the FDA. "The argument I make to parents when I talk to them about this vaccine is, your children are going to grow up," he said. "They're going to need to be protected against this virus for years."

Does the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine provide less protection to children aged 5-11 than to adolescents 12-17? A study from New York State released Monday [28 Feb 2022] suggests that's the case. But new data from 10 states released Tuesday [1 Mar 2022] tell a different story.

The data, published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), suggest that 2 doses of the Pfizer vaccine aren't very protective against infection for either age-group in the face of the omicron variant, but that protection against severe illness appears to be holding up equally in both sets of children (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7109e3.htm).

They do not suggest more rapid waning, or more marked waning, among the younger group of children. "When you look at the whole picture, we're not seeing that signal that New York State is seeing," Ruth Link-Gelles, the CDC's program manager for COVID vaccine efficacy studies, told STAT in an interview.

In addition to the study, published in the CDC's journal Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, the agency was to post statistics from other datasets on its website Tuesday [1 Mar 2022] afternoon. The various data sources tell the same story, Link-Gelles said. "They're seeing actually very similar rates of disease among the 5-11-year-olds and the 12-15s. Where they see the difference is between the unvaccinated and vaccinated."

On Monday [28 Feb 2022], a preprint -- a scientific paper that has not yet been peer-reviewed or published in a journal -- was posted on a server by researchers with the New York State Department of Health [see section [A] above]. Those data show a rapid and substantial decline in protection after vaccination in children in the younger age-group, with efficacy against infections dropping off more quickly and dramatically than the declines seen in children aged 12-17. The study also found a significant, but less steep, decline in protection against hospitalizations.

The researchers noted a sharp difference in the protection seen in 11-year-olds and 12-year-olds, children on either side of the divide between the pediatric dose of the Pfizer vaccine and the adult dose. Adults get 2 shots 21 days apart; each jab contains 30 micrograms of vaccine; for the purpose of dosing, anyone 12 years of age and older is an adult. Children 5-11 get 2 doses on the same schedule, but their jabs contain one-third as much vaccine, 10 micrograms, as the adult dose.

"Our data support vaccine protection against severe disease among children 5-11 years, but suggest rapid loss of protection against infection, in the omicron variant era," the New York State researchers wrote. "Should such findings be replicated in other settings, review of the dosing schedule for children 5-11 years appears prudent."

STAT requested an interview with Eli Rosenberg, the senior author of the New York State paper. But he was not made available.

In the study published by the CDC, vaccine effectiveness against emergency department or urgent care visits during the time when the omicron variant was circulating was between 34% and 45% for adolescents ages 12-17 and 51% for children ages 5-11. Vaccination of children aged 5-11 only began in November [2021] so they were likely more recently vaccinated -- with higher antibody levels -- than children aged 12-17 during that period.

Kathryn Edwards, a vaccine expert at Vanderbilt University, said she is not yet convinced the dose used in 5-11-year-olds was too low. Rather, Edwards said, what's clear from both studies is that in both the younger and older children, 2 doses of vaccine are not enough to fend off omicron-variant SARS-CoV-2 viruses.

"I don't think that there really are any data to suggest that the 5-11-year-olds [are] much worse off than the 12-15-year-olds, with the omicron predominance," Edwards said. "I think that the better part of valor is to say that we need to look at data from more than a single source."

"The data from New York suggested that there was poor protection for the 5-11-year-olds but certainly this," she said, referring to the CDC published paper, "would not suggest this."

Both Edwards and Link-Gelles said more study, over a longer period of time, is going to be needed to get a true sense of how well the Pfizer vaccine is working in children. "I think it's very early to be making the kind of conclusion that they did," Link-Gelles said about the New York State paper.

Medicare beneficiaries with Alzheimer's disease or other types of dementia -- particularly nursing home residents and racial minorities -- died at higher rates than others during the COVID-19 pandemic, finds a large study published yesterday [28 Feb 2022] in JAMA Neurology (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2789614).

A team led by Dartmouth researchers conducted a retrospective study of 53 640 888 Medicare enrollees 65 years or older enrolled in 100% fee-for-service Medicare Parts A and B from 1 Jan 2019 through 31 Dec 2020. Participants were classified into 1 of 4 categories based on Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) status and residence in a nursing home.

The study authors noted that excess deaths include both those caused by COVID-19 and those related to pandemic-related disruptions in healthcare services, decreased access to community support services, social isolation and loneliness, and caregiver burnout.

Of the 26 952 752 patients diagnosed as having ADRD in 2019, 63.5% were women, 2.7% were Asian, 9.2% were Black, 5.7% were Hispanic, and 80.7% were White; the composition changed little among the 26 688 136 patients diagnosed in 2020.

Compared with 2019, the death rate was 12.4% higher among Medicare enrollees without ADRD and 25.7% higher among those with ADRD in 2020. Among nursing home residents without ADRD, the death rate was 24% higher, but it was 33% higher among nursing home residents with ADRD.

ADRD patients saw a 13.3% greater risk of death than non-ADRD patients from March through December 2020. Racial minorities with ADRD had even higher death rates, at 36% for Asian, 36.7% for Black, and 40.1% for Hispanic participants.

The hospital referral region in the lowest quintile for COVID-19 infections in 2020 had no excess deaths in participants without ADRD but an 8.8% higher death rate in community-dwelling enrollees with ADRD and a 14.2% higher rate in nursing home residents with ADRD.

The death rate of ADRD patients in Ridgewood, New Jersey, rose by 104.4%, while it was 110.1% in the Bronx, New York. Philadelphia saw a 62% increase in death rates, despite being in the 3rd-lowest quintile for COVID-19 cases.

Although rates of COVID-19 diagnosis from early and late 2020 tripled across all quintiles, death rates among ADRD patients didn't rise across all quintiles of COVID-19 exposure.

Excess deaths among older ADRD patients early in the pandemic likely resulted from many factors, including their vulnerability to severe COVID-19 infections and disruptions in healthcare, the researchers said. "Because older adults in general and older adults with cognitive impairments are less able to engage effectively with standard telehealth platforms, it is not difficult to imagine how the combination of less effective (or absent) outpatient care and lower inpatient admission rates led to higher mortality," they wrote.

"The elevated mortality risk was found early in the pandemic even in areas with very low COVID-19 infection rates, suggesting that older adults with ADRD, especially those in racial and ethnic minority groups and those living in nursing homes, may be particularly susceptible to changes in healthcare delivery and nursing home care during the 'lockdowns' and other restrictions during the pandemic," the authors concluded.

In a Dartmouth news release, lead author Lauren Gilstrap, MD, MPH, said that dementia patients are a unique population (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/944897). "Our findings also highlight that as a healthcare system we really do have to think about people with cognitive limitations differently, and that more creative solutions are needed to better serve this highly vulnerable segment of society," she said.

In a related editorial, JAMA Neurology Viewpoints Editor Elan Guterman, MD, of the University of California at San Francisco, said that the study findings show that preventable death among older dementia patients results from a failure to mitigate the negative effects of COVID-19 on the healthcare system and on daily life (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2789616).

"Health outcomes among individuals with dementia are closely tied to their base of support because they rely so heavily on social services and informal caregiving to meet their daily needs," she wrote. Many populations have borne the brunt of the pandemic, including older non-White people with or without dementia, Guterman noted.

"We strive to build a health system that reduces, not enlarges, health disparities," she wrote. "To this end, we must explicitly acknowledge that certain individuals are more susceptible to both the direct and indirect effects of COVID-19 and that improving health in these populations includes preventing infection."

Guterman called for a more holistic approach to reducing disease and death among vulnerable populations. "Policies that fail to repair the anemic social networks and patchy medical care resulting from COVID-19 are undeniably incomplete," she concluded.

"As COVID-19 turns from pandemic to endemic, it is time to consider how we might apply a more nuanced approach to evaluating risks and benefits of our health policy measures to combat this pandemic and others to come."

[COVID has exacerbated existing health disparities that must be addressed: "The investigators found that mortality was 24% higher among individuals with ADRD in 2020 compared to 2019, and 14% higher for people without ADRD. Among nursing home residents with ADRD, mortality was 36% higher in 2020 compared to 2019, versus 25% higher for those without ADRD. The largest increases in mortality were observed among Asian, Black, and Hispanic ADRD populations" (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/944897). - Mod.LK]

A global total of 9160 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 26 Feb 2022 to late 27 Feb 2022). The 7-day averages now indicate a decreasing global trend for cases and deaths.

A total of 71 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 36 of the 71 countries are from the European region, 13 are from the Americas region, 10 are from the Western Pacific region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 4 from the South East Asia region, and 2 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 12.7 %, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 14.0 %. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show 21.3% decrease in daily reported cases and 4.8 % increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 1.76 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 438.98 million cumulative reported cases and over 5.98 million reported deaths. There has been a downward trend in the number of cases and deaths globally, however, transmission levels are still quite high and there has been some increase in deaths in the USA. - Mod.UBA]
