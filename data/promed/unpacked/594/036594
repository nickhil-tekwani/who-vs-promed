As of Friday [15 Jul 2022], New York confirmed 490 cases of monkeypox in people -- compared with 238 on Monday, 11 Jul 2022.

Most of the cases have been in New York City's 5 boroughs. However, there were new cases identified upstate as of Friday [15 Jul 2022] -- one each in Erie, Monroe, and St Lawrence counties. Other counties that have had confirmed cases are Chemung, Nassau, Rockland, Suffolk, Sullivan, and Westchester.

State reporting to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention can lag behind real-time data. But as of Friday [15 Jul 2022], New York almost had twice as many cases as the state with the 2nd most confirmed illnesses, California.

Nassau, Suffolk, Saratoga, and Westchester counties are the only counties outside New York City where the state is providing a vaccine. Last week, only about 1/3 of available monkeypox vaccine in Saratoga County was given to people who had made appointments at 2 private clinic times.

Saratoga County, which has had no confirmed cases, said in a release last week that it is being given monkeypox vaccine because of its status as a "tourist" destination. The information did not mention the Saratoga Race Course. However, the track's summer meet, as well as associated events and parties, started Thursday [14 Jul 2022].

Saratoga's health department webpage as of Sunday [17 Jan 2022] did not indicate when more vaccine clinics will be held. The county was initially slated to receive 300 doses to be used for the 1st of the 2-shot regiment. On Tuesday [12 Jul 2022], the state announced Saratoga will get another 620 doses, both to be used for the 2nd shot of the regimen, and for providing vaccine to new patients.

The number of people in the Netherlands diagnosed with the monkeypox virus rose to 656. Since the last update on Thursday [14 Jul 2022], the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) registered 107 positive tests. The institute confirmed 153 infections since last week Monday [11 Jul 2022], which corresponds with the growth rate in the weeks before. The number of women who tested positive increased from one to 3. Previously, a "child of primary school age" got the virus. Most of the monkeypox cases in the Netherlands concern men who have sex with men (MSM).

[5] Democratic Republic of the Congo (Sankuru)
Date: Thu 14 Jul 2022

Sankuru, in central Democratic Republic of the Congo, is seeing a spike in monkeypox cases, which is endemic in the region. Local leaders need support to raise awareness of the disease.

For more than 25 weeks, the central DRC province of Sankuru has been affected by cases of monkeypox. This is not the first time. Monkeypox is endemic in this region; the last outbreak was in 2019.

According to Dr Aim√© Alengo, the head of the provincial health division, 618 cases of monkeypox have been recorded over the past 6 months with 10 deaths, and the lethality is 1.6%. The province of Sankuru straddles the equatorial forest and the population's main activity is hunting, meaning the disease can pass from the animal population to humans relatively easily.

Dr Alengo explains that the health division has strengthened communication with the population and is constantly raising awareness so that every case that shows rashes and other signs specific to monkeypox is referred to a hospital and receives free treatment. "The source of the disease is dead monkeys and rodents in the forest. The people eat these animals and become infected, and transmission continues between humans thereafter," he adds.

At this stage, the provincial health division believes that bringing about a change in the behaviour of the population is the best way to fight the disease. Dr Alengo explains that the health division has strengthened communication with the population and is constantly raising awareness so that every case that shows rashes and other signs specific to monkeypox is referred to a hospital and receives free treatment. "This is where we need support to raise awareness among the population, because until now, awareness raising has been done with our own limited means. We use the community media, and it costs money to broadcast messages," says Dr Alengo.

Several health zones in the province are affected by monkeypox, and the provincial health division is concerned about the increase in cases over the past weeks. The health zone of Bena-Dibele comes 1st with 289 cases and 5 deceased; the other affected health zones are Kole, Lomela, Tshudi Loto, Katako, and Lodja.

Dr Alengo points out that the highest number of deaths are among children under the age of 5. "This is due to the lack of appropriate resuscitation services. In the past, we received support from international donors, but the last project ended 5 years ago and since then we have organised the care with our own resources," he says.

More recently, the province has been able to train health zone managers through WHO support for a refresher course on outbreak management and strengthening communication with the community. The National Programme for the Fight against Monkeypox facilitated the training. "Unfortunately," adds Dr Alengo, "the province received no sample kits and no medication for prevention to take care of those sick." The head of the provincial health division believes that there is also a need to train opinion leaders, especially religious leaders, because they can be very helpful to raise community awareness and reduce people's consumption of inappropriate food that spreads the disease. "People usually listen to them, and they can be of great help in talking to them and help change their behaviours," he adds.

[6] USA: control challenge
Date: Mon 18 Jul 2022

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/07/window-control-monkeypox-may-be-closing-us


As the United States confirms 1814 monkeypox cases from 45 states, some public health experts are expressing fears that the virus is becoming entrenched in the country, and the window to control the outbreak and eliminate the virus from the country is closing quickly.

Several media outlets over the weekend [16-17 Jul 2022] reported that access to treatments and vaccines is still far from streamlined, with doctors required to make formal requests from the national stockpile each time they wish to treat a patient with Tpoxx, an antiviral used to treat smallpox that can also be used for monkeypox.

Former Food and Drug Administration (FDA) commissioner Scott Gottlieb, said on talk shows yesterday [17 Jul 2022] that the window for controlling monkeypox in the United States has probably closed and said the official US total is only a small fraction of the cases in the country. "We're now at the cusp of this becoming an endemic virus, with this now become something that's persistent that we need to continue to deal with," Gottlieb said.

In the New York Times, people who have contracted the virus recount waiting days for test results and hours in the emergency department before receiving a diagnosis. What's more, despite having the most cases as any US city, New York City is still in short supply of vaccines.

The FDA is urging providers to test for monkeypox by taking swab samples of lesions from patients with suspected cases. "The FDA is not aware of clinical data supporting the use of other sample types, such as blood or saliva, for monkeypox virus testing. Testing samples not taken from a lesion may lead to false test results," the agency said.
