[Some questions have arisen about this report from Zimbabwe and its veracity. Clarification was provided by a member and friend. - Mod.MHJ]

JCA Davies (cited in the article) retired decades ago. The article although recently online is dated 1979 and the description of events is consistent with the 1979 epizootic.

[Glenn did his PhD dissertation on the Rhodesian use of CBW during the bush war so he is very experienced as to what happened there, and knew the people. Mahmoud Orabi also had problems with this report in The Herald. So clearly the paper had just republished an earlier report of 15 Nov 1979. It should not have been posted and I apologize for making the mistake. - Mod.MHJ]
