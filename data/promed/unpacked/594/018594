Infectious disease morbidity statistics, 1997 - Russia 980602103410

The data regarding HIV infection presented in the 2 June 1998 posting
"Infection Morbidity in the Russian Federation, Jan-Dec 1997" are not
correct.
Official statistics regarding HIV and AIDS are issued by the Russian
Federal AIDS Center, under the direction of Prof. V. V. Pokrovskiy. Their
latest publication entitled "HIV-infection Surveillance in Russia in
1991-1997 (Statistics)" reports that there were 4399 new HIV-positive cases
in 1997.
This is a 284.5% increase over 1996 (1546 new cases).The number of 4399 new
cases differs significantly from the 3853 reported in the 2 June posting.
The total number of registered AIDS patients at the end of 1997 was 101.
The source of the data for new HIV-positive cases in 1996 and 1997 in the
Public Health and Environment Bulletin, Issue #1, January 1998 is not clear.

[It appears that there is a lack of coordination between the supplier of
infectious disease statistics to the Public Health and Environment Bulletin
and the Russian Federal AIDS Center. Unfortunately, Russia is not the only
country where this sort of
thing occurs - Mod.JW
