Horses suspected of having equine herpes virus
----------------------------------------------
One horse on a local farm has been euthanized and 3 others are showing
milder clinical signs of the disease. The Western College of Veterinary
Medicine says testing is under way to confirm the diagnosis of the
neurologic form of equine herpes virus type 1, also known as EHV-1.

In mid-March 2008, a local riding stable started reporting cases of EHV-1.
A total of 15 horses were treated and are recovering. Dr Katharina Lohmann
says there was contact between the farms before clinical signs of EHV-1
appeared. Both locations are under a voluntary quarantine to prevent the
spread of the virus.

Dr Lohmann says EHV-1 has not been reported at any other farms. Signs
include fever, swollen limbs, trouble with co-ordination and bladder
problems. EHV-1 can not be transmitted to humans or to other animal species.

A public information meeting will be held on Thu 10 Apr 2008. An infectious
disease specialist will make a presentation and answer any questions about
EHV-1. It runs from 7-9 pm in the Diefenbaker Room at the Ramada Hotel in
Saskatoon.

More information about EHV-1 is available at

[It is to be hoped that their efforts of self-quarantine will be effective.
This virus seems to move rather easily and can have unpleasant consequences
when it becomes a neurological disease and requires euthanization. - Mod.TG]
