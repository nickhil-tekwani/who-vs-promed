The University of Wisconsin-Madison announced yesterday [16 Feb 2022] that students will no longer be required to wear masks on campus beginning 12 Mar 2022, when the university begins spring break. University of Wisconsin System President Tommy Thompson said more than 95% of Madison's student body is fully vaccinated, and cases across the state have dropped significantly in recent weeks.

"The research strongly suggests that individuals who are vaccinated, boosted, and wearing a high-quality mask have a high degree of protection, regardless of what other individuals around them may choose," the school said in a statement. "That means we're at a point where responsible behavior is up to the individual to decide." The student body government said it opposed this decision, wanting mask requirements to remain in place until the end of spring semester [2022].

Purdue University in Indiana also announced that masks will be optional in indoor spaces, including sports venues, beginning tomorrow [18 Feb 2022] (https://bit.ly/3sbJilP).

Across the country, states, universities, and businesses are attempting to piece together a new framework for living with COVID-19 as cases drop dramatically from January [2022] highs. In the 9-state Northeast region, the 7-day death average is down about 51% from the late-January peak, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Johns Hopkins data (https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-death-reports-begin-to-drop-as-omicron-surge-rapidly-fades-11645102721).

But 15 states have seen at least a 10% increase in deaths over the last week, ABC News reports (https://abcnews.go.com/Health/live-updates/coronavirus/?id=82873081#82928422). The United States reported 136 488 new COVID-19 cases yesterday [16 Feb 2022] and 3083 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/cumulative-cases).

Yesterday [16 Feb 2022], the attorney general of Texas sued to strike down the Biden administration's mandate requiring travelers to wear masks at airports and on airplanes and commuter bus and rail systems, the New York Times reports (https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/17/business/texas-airport-federal-mask-mandate.html). The current federal mandate is in place until 18 Mar 2022 for all travelers ages 2 and older, regardless of vaccination status.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID Data Tracker shows that 64.5% of Americans are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, 76% have received at least one dose of vaccine, and 43% of fully vaccinated Americans have received a booster dose (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total).

- Parts of Asia experiencing omicron-led surges reported new record daily cases over the past day, including South Korea, Malaysia, and Hong Kong, where news reports show patients in beds outside of hospitals waiting to be admitted and say city officials are considering mass testing.

- More countries that are past their omicron peaks have announced plans to ease restrictions, including Portugal and Israel, which is dropping its "green pass" needed to show proof of vaccination or recovery from COVID-19 to enter some public places.

- Germany-based BioNTech yesterday [16 Feb 2022] unveiled module container labs to allow mRNA vaccine to be made in Africa, part of an effort to boost international COVID-19 vaccine supply. The bulk product would be made in the labs, and local companies would handle fill-and-finish steps. The 1st is set to arrive in Africa in the last half of the year [2022], with shipments to Rwanda, Senegal, and possibly, South Africa.

- The World Health Organization today [17 Feb 2022] released interim guidance on contact tracing and quarantine for settings in which omicron activity is high. It says policies may need to be adjusted in places where essential services are under pressure (for example, shortening quarantine to 10 days without a test and 7 days with a negative test if asymptomatic). It added that modifications will increase the risk of onward transmission and should be weighed against healthcare capacity and other considerations (https://bit.ly/3h133pG).

- Health Canada today [17 Feb 2022] approved Novavax's recombinant, adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine for use in people ages 18 and older, the company said today (https://ir.novavax.com/2022-02-17-Health-Canada-Authorizes-Novavax-COVID-19-Vaccine). Last month [January 2022], Novavax and Canada signed an advance purchase agreement for 52 million doses, with the option for another 24 million doses.

- The global totals today climbed to 419 038 393 cases and 5 857 142 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins online dashboard (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/).

[2] Africa
Date: Fri 18 Feb 2022

https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/02/18/africa-covid-cases-number-study/


It's one of the enduring mysteries of COVID-19: Why didn't the pandemic hit low-income African nations as hard as wealthy countries in North America and Europe?

There is no simple answer to that question. But this week, 2 new studies added to our understanding of it. One suggested that the number of COVID-19 cases may be vastly undercounted across the continent; another found good evidence that the number of deaths in at least one country could be significantly undercounted.

Neither study necessarily changes our current big picture understanding of the pandemic -- that wealthy countries often saw worse outcomes than developing nations. However, they could have a big impact on the debate about how and why African nations were forgotten by wealthy nations during the pandemic -- especially as the European Union and the African Union meet in a joint summit in Brussels and the World Health Organization pushes for wealthy nations to back a South African facility that aims to share mRNA technology.

"In Africa, 83% of people still have not received a single dose," WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Tuesday [15 Feb 2022] at a Vaccine Equity for Africa event in Germany. "This is not only a moral failure, it is also an epidemiological failure, which is creating the ideal conditions for new variants to emerge."

The coronavirus ravaged almost all corners of the earth, including wealthy nations like the United States and Britain. In Africa, things went differently. The continent "appears to have bucked the doomsday predictions of global health experts," my colleagues wrote in December 2020.

Even after the fast-spreading omicron variant, first identified in southern Africa late last year [2021], that trend has largely held up. One-fifth of the world's population lives in Africa, but the continent has accounted for only a tiny sliver of confirmed cases around the world.

According to Our World in Data, as of mid-February [2022], 2.7% of all confirmed COVID-19 cases were found on the continent. By comparison, North America saw 22% of all global cases; Europe more than one-third.

But reliable public tracking of new daily COVID-19 cases rests on something important: easy access to coronavirus tests and the expensive infrastructure to administer and track their results. Throughout the pandemic, many African nations had neither.

In a preprint study released this week, a team of researchers with WHO backing tried to tackle that problem by looking at available data about people with COVID-19 antibodies across the continent (https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.02.14.22270934). These studies, known as seroprevalence surveys, use bloodwork to show who has some level of immunity to the coronavirus -- whether through vaccinations or a previous infection.

The study found that levels of immunity in Africa appeared to be vastly higher than could be explained by official case numbers, even when combined with the continent's paltry vaccination levels. Every nation surveyed had far higher levels of immunity than official figures showed; Nigeria had a ratio of 958 to 1.

By September 2021, over 65% of the continent had some form of immunity to COVID-19, the study estimated. This, the authors write, suggests there had not been 8.2 million cases across the continent by that time -- but 800 million.

If this was accurate, did no one notice? One possibility, raised by the WHO-backed study, is that many of the cases in Africa may have been asymptomatic -- perhaps more than two-thirds. Compared with Europe and North America, most African countries have relatively young populations that are less likely to see serious illness from the coronavirus.

The comparatively low number of deaths recorded from COVID-19 across the continent seems to support this idea. Just 4% of deaths globally were recorded in Africa, according to Our World in Data.

There are many signs that not all deaths from COVID-19 are caught in official figures. Even in the United States, the number of "excess deaths" recorded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that are not directly attributed to COVID-19 is roughly 100 000.

Most African nations do not collect the data needed to estimate excess mortality. But a small and innovative study released by the World Bank this week used an unusual method to estimate pandemic deaths in Kenya: a popular obituary website (https://blogs.worldbank.org/africacan/could-covid-19-deaths-kenya-be-higher-official-records).

By looking back at several years on the website -- which was used because better data did not exist -- the researchers were able to see how past trends compared to the pandemic years. Their conclusion was that since the start of the pandemic, there have been roughly 28 000 "excess deaths" during the pandemic period, compared with just 5520 recorded in official government figures.

Neither study provides anything like a full accounting of COVID-19 in Africa. Instead, they add to a better understanding of the many gaps in knowledge about COVID-19 that remain 2 years into the pandemic.

If we take the idea that both cases and deaths in Africa were significantly undercounted, it has some surprising knock-on impacts. In some cases, it may mean that demand for coronavirus vaccines across Africa could be lower. A number of groups, including the WHO's Africa branch, have already suggested that the worst is over for the continent. Any plan for manufacturing on the continent will have to deal with this factor, as a recent analysis by the Center for Global Development argued.

More broadly, it refutes the idea that COVID-19 was simply a disease for rich countries. As other studies have shown, there was a range of experiences among wealthy nations. And when excess deaths are evaluated on a global scale, the vast majority of them may have been in the developing world. Africa wasn't miraculously spared from the pandemic, and there's little reason to think it could not be hit far harder next time.

[3] Nasal vaccine
Date: Tue 15 Feb 2022 15:52 EST
Source: Time [abridged, edited]
https://time.com/6148257/nasal-vaccines-covid-19/


When SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, infiltrates the body, it typically enters through the nose or mouth, then takes root and begins replicating. But what if it could never get a foothold in the upper airways? That's the promise of nasal COVID-19 vaccines, which are meant to prevent infection by blocking the virus at its point of entry.

There is not yet a nasal COVID-19 vaccine available in the United States -- and it's not clear if or when there will be -- but multiple research teams in the United States, including the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and abroad are working on them. Russian scientists are testing a nasal form of their Sputnik V vaccine in adult volunteers, and researchers in India have gotten approval for a Phase 3 trial.

Many researchers are excited about the prospect of nasal vaccines for COVID-19. "Yes with an exclamation point," says Troy Randall, an immunologist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, when asked if they're worth exploring.

In countries like the United States, where about 76% of people have had at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, nasal vaccines would by default be used primarily as booster shots, and some research teams are studying them specifically in this capacity. But if they're found to be effective and eventually authorized, they could also give young children and people who fear needles more options.

There's a long road ahead. While oral vaccines are fairly common, the only nasal vaccine cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration to fight a respiratory pathogen is FluMist, which is used to prevent influenza among people ages 2-49. FluMist was in development for decades but was briefly taken off the market due to efficacy issues, which could foreshadow the challenges awaiting vaccine researchers working to create a nasal COVID-19 vaccine.

Still, researchers hope that nasal vaccines may one day do what even the highly effective mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna have not: slow transmission enough to bring the pandemic to an end.

Shot-in-the-arm COVID-19 vaccines introduce the body to genetic material from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, teaching the immune system what to do if it's faced with the real thing. These shots have proven very good at preventing severe disease and death, but less adept at blocking infections -- particularly against highly contagious omicron.

Nasal vaccines could theoretically prevent many infections by conferring "local" immunity where it's needed most: the nose. If it worked, a spritz would blanket the upper airways with defenses similar to those generated by the body after a brush with the actual virus, says Dr. James Crowe, director of Vanderbilt University Medical Center's Vaccine Center.

"You get the best immunity to virus pathogens by mimicking, to the greatest extent possible, the actual infection without causing disease," Crowe says. "Stopping a virus in its tracks, right at the front door, is very attractive."

If done right, Crowe says, nasal vaccines could be highly effective -- but developing them is difficult. They typically use live but weakened forms of a virus, which introduces a "Goldilocks" challenge, Crowe says. Weaken the virus too much and the vaccine won't work; not enough, and it could overstimulate the immune system, leading to side effects. The balance has to be perfect.

The nose is also a very different environment than the deltoid muscle, where shots are typically given. It's a near-direct line to the brain, which clearly necessitates a different set of precautions, Crowe says.

The upper airways are also built to encounter foreign substances and thus may not respond as readily to a vaccine, says Benjamin Goldman-Israelow, an instructor at the Yale School of Medicine. He co-authored a recent study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, that examined how mice responded to nasal vs injected COVID-19 vaccines. The research found that mice mounted a stronger immune response when they were injected first and then boosted with a nasal vaccine, as opposed to getting a nasal vaccine alone.

That may be because the upper airways are equipped with natural defenses against invading particles -- they're the body's entry point for the outside world, after all -- and thus do not always respond strongly when first introduced. "By giving that initial priming through the [injected] mRNA vaccine, we educate the immune system, so that by the time we give the intranasal boost, the immune system already knows to recognize this as foreign," Goldman-Israelow says.

Nasal vaccines are difficult to get right. In the early 2000s, long before the COVID-19 pandemic, a nasal flu vaccine used in Switzerland was found to be associated with Bell's palsy, a form of facial paralysis that is typically temporary. By the time that research was published, it was no longer in clinical use.

FluMist, the nasal flu vaccine used in the United States and first approved in 2003, hasn't run into such safety issues, but it was briefly taken off the market due to efficacy problems. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine advisory committee did not recommend its use in 2016, citing data that it had been only 3% effective during the prior flu season. A reformulated version of the vaccine returned to market for the 2018-2019 season. In its current form, "it does seem to work, and the data are supportive of its continued use," El Sahly says.

Still, FluMist is not authorized for people who are 50 and older or younger than 2. It's also not recommended for immunocompromised individuals and some people who have lung conditions such as asthma. That's because it contains a live but weakened virus: an effective way to prompt an immune response, but one that can lead to potentially serious side effects in people with underlying conditions.

"It's a balancing act," Randall says. "You want the vaccine to be effective, but you don't want it to really hurt or cause [too much] inflammation."

A global total of 11 405 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 16 Feb 2022 to late 17 Feb 2022). The exponential rise in cases over the last few weeks can be attributed to the rapid spread of the omicron variant globally. However, the 7-day averages now indicate a decreasing global trend for cases and deaths.

A total of 88 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 47 of the 88 countries are from the European region, 12 are from the Americas region, 13 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, 6 from the South East Asia region, and 4 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 23.6%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 5.6%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 54.0% decrease in daily reported cases and a 6.7% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily report counted over 1.93 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 422.23 million cumulative reported cases and over 5.89 million reported deaths. Despite some decrease in the number of cases, transmission continues at a very high level. - Mod.UBA]
