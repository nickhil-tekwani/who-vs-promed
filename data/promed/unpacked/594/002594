[1] 2nd lockdowns, restrictions
[A] Israel

Israel is passing milestones no other nation wants to reach, after repeated missteps by Binyamin Netanyahu's government.

Blighted by one of the highest levels of coronavirus infection, with more than 4000 new cases daily, it is about to become the 1st country to go back into national lockdown.

The decision taken by the cabinet in Jerusalem on Thursday [10 Sep 2020] to start a lockdown next Friday [18 Sep 2020], on the eve of the Jewish new year, led to claims of political considerations trumping public health.

Details of the new lockdown have still to be finalised but are likely to include a ban on moving more than 500 metres from home, and limits on gatherings of ten people indoors and 20 outdoors. Schools will shut and teachers will switch to giving lessons online.

[B] UK: rule of 6
Date: Mon 14 Sep 2020

Restrictions banning social gatherings of more than 6 people are now in effect, as COVID-19 cases keep rising. The "rule of six" applies both indoors and outdoors in England and Scotland, and indoors only in Wales. England's restrictions affect everyone, but children under 11 in Wales and under 12 in Scotland are exempt. The restrictions began after the UK's R number escalated to between 1 and 1.2 for the 1st time since March [2020], indicating infections are rising. A further 3330 positive cases were recorded in the UK on Sunday [13 Sep 2020] -- the 3rd consecutive day with more than 3000 -- with 5 more deaths reported. According to the UK government's coronavirus dashboard, the total number of reported coronavirus deaths across the UK is 41 628.

Mr Malthouse told BBC Radio 4's Today programme people should use the non-emergency contact number to report gatherings of seven or more to the police. "If they are concerned and they do see that kind of thing then absolutely they should," he said.

The minister added that COVID-secure marshals -- who could promote the new rules -- had proved useful across the country during lockdown and "the intention is that we roll those out across the country."

Home Secretary Priti Patel earlier urged the public not to break the rules and said "the recent rise in cases makes it clear that more needs to be done to stop the spread of this disease."

At-a-glance: What are the new rules?
------------------------------------
- Social gatherings of more than 6 people in England, Scotland, and Wales will not be allowed in law from Monday [14 Sep 2020] with some exceptions.
- The new rule applies to people in private homes, indoors and outdoors, and places such as pubs, restaurants, cafes, and public outdoor spaces.
- In Scotland, the rule applies to a maximum of 2 households and in Wales, it applies to the same extended household.
- It applies to all ages in England, but not to those aged 12 and under in Scotland, and those under 11 in Wales.
- The rule does not apply to schools and workplaces, or weddings, funerals, and organised team sports.
- A full list of exemptions has been published in England.
- People who ignore police could be fined GB 100 [about USD 129] -- doubling with each offence to a maximum of GBP 3200 [about USD 4130].

Under the new rules, larger gatherings are still allowed at gyms, schools, places of worship, weddings, and funerals. Education and work settings are not affected.
The "rule of six" in England replaces the existing ban on gatherings of more than 30 people and the current guidance on allowing 2 households to meet indoors and a previous ban on gatherings which exceeded 30 people.

Meanwhile, people across England told BBC News they are struggling to access coronavirus tests, with dozens unable to book a swab.

[2] COVID-19-influenza double epidemic?
Date: September 2020

ref: Balakrishnan VS. In preparation for a COVID-19-influenza double epidemic. Lancet Microbe. 2020l 1(5), e184-e225. doi:10.1016/S2666-5247(20)30130-0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHO reports the worldwide circulation of influenza virus to be much lower than expected for this time of the year. With over 22 million cases and nearly 800â€ˆ000 deaths due to COVID-19 reported globally at the time of writing and the northern hemisphere entering the influenza season, this low circulation of influenza virus could be matters of both reassurance and concern, warns WHO. The decreased circulation of the virus is likely largely attributable to the mandatory physical distancing and hygiene protocols implemented to curb the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. However, the potential impact of altered infection testing priorities, healthcare personnel capacity, and health seeking behaviours during the pandemic should not be ignored.

"We need to bear in mind that the measures we're putting in place to control COVID-19 may have some benefits for the flu as well but with the resurgence of COVID-19 there may also be a double epidemic of flu and COVID-19 during the [northern hemisphere] winter," said Richard Pebody (WHO Regional Office for Europe, Copenhagen, Denmark). "All that we can do about it is to be ready and prepared with a range of measures we've got in our community ammunition box," he added.

In addition to continuing adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), one way to prepare for a possible double epidemic is to ramp up the testing capacity for both COVID-19 and seasonal infections. For example, the WHO National Influenza Centre at the Westmead Hospital (Westmead, NSW, Australia) continued to test for other respiratory viruses throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. By June [2020], it had done twice the number of tests it would have usually. "What was interesting was that we actually had negligible cases of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus compared to previous seasons," said Jen Kok (Westmead Hospital). "We were doing a lot of testing, but we just weren't finding any cases whatsoever", he added. Detections of these infections have been the lowest since New South Wales started recording them, despite the increased number of tests.

Combination testing for both COVID-19 and influenza could also be beneficial, as a single sample could be used to distinguish the two infections in patients presenting with similar symptoms. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued the 3rd emergency use authorisation in July [2020] for such a combination test, which is yet to be rolled out. A UK equivalent of the test is expected to be available in UK National Health Service hospitals from September. "It would be great if other countries and agencies would pursue developing more combination tests because assessing for multiple diseases in a single swab can also help reduce the demand for testing supplies and reduce the risk of exposure to health-care workers collecting the sample," said Nidia Sequeira Trovao (US National Institute of Health, Washington, DC, USA).
Another strategy to reduce the likelihood of a double epidemic would be to strengthen existing influenza vaccination programmes. "We've got several questions in the air for what will happen in the next season but having [COVID-19 and influenza] circulate at the same time is really something that you want to avoid as much as possible," said Pasi Penttinen (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, Stockholm, Sweden). "But for influenza, we're lucky to have a vaccine and now the debate among public health authorities is how to broaden the flu shot target groups from the current consensus," Penttinen added.

Healthcare workers are at the forefront of COVID-19 care and are likely to be mandated for influenza shots. Vaccination of children is also under consideration. In the 2017-18 influenza season, only 6 countries in the EU recommended vaccination of children, but Penttinen thinks that "[to vaccinate children or not] is a question that countries should have right now because vaccinating children against influenza reduces their risk of transmission of flu to the elderly and thus protects them better than direct vaccination of the elderly."

However, expanding influenza shot programmes does not come without difficulties. Several countries would have placed an order for the vaccine before the pandemic, so increasing the demand now could lead to a vaccine shortage. Moreover, realigned resources to vaccination programmes during the pandemic might have a negative impact on the response to COVID-19. "So countries are faced with a very difficult dilemma here in terms of how much effort to put into the influenza vaccination program in this situation," Penttinen said.

Overall, experts bet on the documented benefits of NPIs and believe that increased preparedness could prevent a serious double epidemic. "I think the feared double epidemic will probably not happen [since] the continuing social distancing that we are likely to see well into next year [2021] should be sufficient to suppress any influenza epidemic," said Paul Hunter (University of East Anglia, Norwich, UK). However, he added that when we get back to normal after COVID-19 with very low influenza activity we might have declined herd immunity to influenza. "It would be a shame if we get through COVID-19 only to be hit harder by influenza the following winter season," said Hunter.

The solution to early detection of single or multiple pathogen infections lies in implementing robust indicator based and/or sentinel surveillance supported by reliable and quality laboratory testing so that disease trends and impending surges/outbreaks can be effectively monitored. - Mod.UBA]

[The USA, India, and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations, with India now in the 2nd position followed by Brazil. In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (93 215), followed by the USA (31 857) and Brazil (14 597) -- account for over half of all confirmed cases globally (54.4%) and 57.2% of all newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. A global total of 4205 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (12-13 Sep 2020).

Countries reporting more than 5000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours include India, USA, Brazil, Spain (0), Argentina (9056), Colombia (7355), France (7183), Peru (6787), Mexico (5674), and Russia (5449), and 28 countries have reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours. 5 of the top 10 countries reporting the highest daily newly confirmed cases are from the Americas region. Spain reported the 4th highest daily cases globally on 11 Sep 2020, but the case numbers over the last 48 hours have not been reported.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is a decrease in case counts by 0.59%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 10.10%.

Impression: Cases are increasing globally, with Europe showing major increasing transmission in many countries. - Mod.UBA]
