The listeriosis outbreak in Spain is thought to have claimed a 2nd life. A 72 year old man with cancer died on Thu 22 Aug 2019. On Tue 20 Aug 2019, a 90 year old woman passed away. Both victims lived in Sevilla, the centre of the outbreak.

At the moment, there is no confirmation that the man had eaten the La Mecha branded "carne mechada" that has been traced as the source of the outbreak that has so far affected 186 people. An investigation is under way to determine whether his death from listeriosis is linked. The outbreak has been traced to utensils used in the preparation of the food products.

Now experts say that the bacteria may be present in other products from the Magrudis factory in Sevilla. All its production has been recalled, with experts saying that at least 2 other products are at high risk of having been infected.

According to the latest data from the Junta de Andalucia regional government, 186 cases of listeriosis have been detected. Of these, 161 have occurred in Andalucia. The bulk (82 per cent) are in the province of Sevilla, with 153 cases. In the last 24 hours, there have been 25 more cases in total.

Of the 99 people in hospital on Fri 23 Aug 2019, 18 have been confirmed as having listeriosis, with 4 in intensive care. The rest are suspected cases and are under observation.

Medical authorities say this strain of the bacterium is particularly virulent, taking 3 days to incubate. Normally, the incubation period is up to 70 days. [The incubation period, that is, the duration it takes for symptoms to develop, varies from 3-70 days, with an estimated median incubation period of 3 weeks. - Mod.ML]

Tests carried out on larding needles used by the Seville-based company Magrudis to make a pork loin product called carne mechada have returned positive results for the presence of the bacteria _Listeria monocytogenes_, according to documents to which El Pais has had access. This confirms that its processing plant is one of the infected sites behind the current outbreak of listeriosis that has so far affected 200 people throughout Spain, most of them in Andalusia.

A 90 year old woman died in the early hours of Monday [19 Aug 2019] in a Seville hospital after having contracted the bacterial infection, while it emerged on Friday [23 Aug 2019] that a terminal cancer patient had died with listeria in his bloodstream. It is not yet clear, however, whether that patient's death was related to the outbreak.

Carne mechada, the product produced by Magrudis that is thought to be behind the outbreak, the biggest ever seen in Spain, is made by cooking pork loin in its own fat. The lard is introduced into the meat using larding needles before it is cooked. It is then usually served cold and in thin slices. The company sells the carne mechada, along with other similar products -- such as lomo, preserved pork loin, and chicharrones, pork belly -- under the brand name La Mecha. Seville City Hall confirmed on Fri 23 Aug 2019 that 2 other La Mecha products have been found to be contaminated: pork loin with sherry, and pork loin with paprika.

Spain issued an international alert on Thu 22 Aug 2019 with European authorities and the World Health Organization (WHO) "given the possibility that cases might be detected in other countries" should tourists visiting the country have consumed the affected products. So far, no cases have been detected outside Spanish territory.

It also emerged on Fri 23 Aug 2019 that the carne mechada produced by Magrudis had been sold on to a firm called Comercial Martinez Leon for resale with a different brand name. The authorities were not aware of this fact until Tue 20 Aug 2019, 5 days after the initial health alert was raised. These products were in circulation until they were ordered to be withdrawn on Wed 21 Aug 2019.

Samples were taken from the company's production plant last Friday [16 Aug 2019?], and the results were returned on Monday [19 Aug 2019?]. The analysis of the larding needles was the 1st to become public knowledge.

"If the larding needles were contaminated, there is no doubt that other areas of the production line were too," said Juan Jose Rodriguez, a professor at the Autonomous University of Barcelona and a member of the Spanish Society of Food Safety. Rodriguez explained that the "larding needle is an instrument used to fill raw meat, meaning that the bacteria should not survive the roasting process, and the final contamination may have taken place during another moment on the production line." He added that the results were "worrying, because they reveal widespread contamination that was unknown to the heads of the company."

This new information points to a 2-fold failure in the Magrudis production line, according to experts consulted by El Pais. The 1st, which has now been confirmed, implies a lack of hygiene in the processing plant itself. The 2nd is the failure to detect the contamination of the final meat products, despite existing legislation obliging such producers to carry out tests on at least 5 samples of every batch produced.

These rules mean that food-production companies must design and execute a plan to guarantee that their products are put on the market with no risks to human health. Each firm has the freedom to carry out such plans however they see fit, but they are subject to regular inspections from the health authorities.

As well as carne mechada, Magrudis also produces 8 more products at its plant. The regional government in Andalusia, known as the Junta, requested that Seville City Hall carry out tests on these products on Mon 19 Aug 2019 and ordered them to be taken off the market on Wed 21 Aug 2019, a move that sources from the Junta said were precautionary. The central Health Ministry in Madrid advised on Thu 22 Aug 2019 that consumers should not eat any of the products made by the Seville-based firm.

On Fri 23 Aug 2019, it was reported that 82% of new cases in Andalusia were registered in Seville. In total, there were 99 people receiving hospital treatment, 17 more than on Thu 22 Aug 2019. Of these, 31 are pregnant women. Four people are currently being treated in intensive care, one more than the previous day. Of those in hospital, 18 have been confirmed to have listeriosis, while the remainder of patients are still being tested.

Social alarm over the listeriosis outbreak has seen emergency rooms in Seville overwhelmed by an increase in potential patients. On Wednesday [21 Aug 2019] night, medical staff from the Virgen del Rocio hospital, one of the biggest in the Andalusian capital, dealt with 100 more people than usual, 23% above the average. The majority had symptoms of the bacterial infection, according to a spokesperson from the Junta committee managing the crisis. The pressure on medical teams is such that doctors are resorting to WhatsApp groups to request help to cover shifts and draft in reinforcements.

Despite extra staff being drafted in, the wait times in the emergency room at Virgen del Rocio on Thu 22 Aug 2019 evening were as high as 4 hours, and the personnel at the hospital were overwhelmed. Zahara Palos, a 28-year-old woman, arrived at 3pm with symptoms of diarrhea and fever. She was not seen by doctors until 7pm. "I'm desperate," she complained. "I want to leave here with a solution."

[The listeriosis outbreak, which was previously reported to have affected 114 people (ProMED-mail post Listeriosis - Europe (07): (Spain) meat, recall, fatal 20190821.6634032), is now said to involve 200 people, in many of whom the diagnosis of listeriosis may be as yet unconfirmed. The cases are occurring mainly in the province of Seville, but the outbreak may extend throughout Spain and even beyond. Listeria have been identified in at least 3 meat products and in needles used to inject lard into the meat before it is cooked; after cooking, the meat is usually served cold and in thin slices. Proper cooking of the meat should have killed listeria, which suggests either that the meat may have been improperly cooked or that contamination may have also occurred after cooking. All products from this meat processing facility in Seville have apparently now been recalled.

Because it can take up to 70 days after exposure to listeria for symptoms of listeriosis to develop, more cases can be expected.

Genotyping clinical isolates of _L. monocytogenes will help identify clusters of cases that have a common source, and genotyping the isolates from the food and environmental surfaces at the meat processing facility will help confirm the source, if genotypes match. We await further developments in the investigation of this outbreak. - Mod.ML
