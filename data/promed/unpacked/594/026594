[1] USDA statement
Date: Tue 9 Oct 2007

The US Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Food Safety and Inspection
Service (FSIS) is investigating a Missouri establishment that on Tue 9 Oct
2007 voluntarily ceased operations due to reported illnesses linked to
their products. Banquet brand and generic store brand frozen
not-ready-to-eat pot pie products with "P-9" printed on the side of the
package may be the potential source of reported illnesses caused by
salmonella based on epidemiological evidence collected by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state public health departments.
On Wed 3 Oct 2007, CDC launched a multistate case control study with
detailed questions on chicken and egg consumption. Based on additional
information provided by the Minnesota Department of Health, CDC added
questions to the study on 5 Oct 2007 focusing on frozen chicken or turkey
pot pie product consumption. FSIS was notified on 5 Oct 2007 that states
had identified an FSIS-regulated product to the CDC as the potential source
of contamination.
After discussions with CDC and the states throughout the weekend, on 8 Oct
2007 FSIS dispatched specially trained investigators to gather additional
information at the federally inspected establishment producing these frozen
pot pie products. The Agency is advising consumers not to eat or to discard
these chicken or turkey pot pie products until we are able to determine the
source, products and potential production dates of contamination, and to
verify proper cooking instructions for these not-ready-to-eat products. We
will provide updates as further information becomes available.
ConAgra, which is cooperating in the investigation, will provide
information regarding these products at <http://www.conagrafoods.com>.
Consumers with questions about these products may contact the company
hotline at (866) 484-8671.

[2] Wisconsin cases
Date: Tue 9 Oct 2007

At least 19 people in Wisconsin are among the 139 people from around the
country who have been sickened by a strain of salmonella [as yet the
serotype has not been elucidated - Mod.LL] that may be linked to Banquet
chicken and turkey pot pies.
Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Missouri have reported the largest numbers of
sick people among the 30 states to identify such cases. The 19 Wisconsin
cases involve people in 12 counties, including Milwaukee and Waukesha, said
Stephanie Marquis, a spokeswoman with the Wisconsin Department of Health
and Family Services. Those sickened in Wisconsin range in age from 3 to 79,
and 11 of them are younger than 19.
"We are really seeing a lot of kids," Marquis said. No deaths have been
reported. At least 3 people in Wisconsin have been hospitalized. "Everyone
is recovering," Marquis said.
The USDA said the Missouri plant made Banquet and generic store brand pot
pies. All of the pot pies made at the plant in question have "P-9" printed
on the side of the box as part of a code above the use-by date.
Federal officials said consumers shouldn't discard or eat the pies until
the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) determines the source of the
salmonella contamination and verifies proper cooking instructions.
ConAgra spokeswoman Stephanie Childs said the company is working with
federal investigators to determine whether any additional precautions are
necessary. No recall is being planned, she said. Childs said ConAgra is
confident in the safety of its chicken and turkey pot pies when all the
cooking instructions on the package are followed. It is particularly
important to follow the directions when microwaving, she said.

[ProMED-mail awaits more information regarding the serotype of _S.
enterica_ involved here. It is somewhat noteworthy that both chicken and
turkey pot pies are implicated. This may suggest a common contamination source.
The term "pot pie" (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pot_pie>) describes a
type of baked savory pie with a bottom and top completely surrounded in
flakey crusts and baked in its own pie tin. This is in contrast to the
Australian meat pie and many British regional variants on pie recipes,
which may have a top of flakey pastry, but whose body is made from heavier,
more mechanically stable shortcrust, hot water crust, or similar pastry. An
American pot pie typically has a filling of meat (particularly beef,
chicken or turkey), gravy, and mixed vegetables (potatoes, carrots, green
beans, and peas). Frozen pot pies (as in this outbreak) are often available
in individual serving size. - Mod.LL]
