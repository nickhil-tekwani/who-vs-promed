I would like to draw attention to the fact that hepatitis in the patient from Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital (STIDH) must have been acquired before the earthquake and it was an isolated event. There was less than a week from the time of the earthquake till the time the patient was seen at STIDH which is less than the incubation period of most hepatitides. There are reports of outbreaks of diarrhea which happen during the pre-monsoon months normally also. We need to rationalize events since it affects perception of risk in Nepal by individuals, agencies and governments. Significant number of Governments from the West, India and China have already pulled their nationals - both healthy and injured from this country.

Government and NGO's, although slow to start with, are making massive efforts now to educate the public about need for drinking clean or treated water and having designated areas for field toilets. This will hopefully reduce the risk of enterically transmitted infections.

For persons engaged in relief work in Nepal, we are continuing our recommendation to take hepatitis A and typhoid vaccines, to drink treated, boiled or bottled water and to carry a personal medical kit. Thank you.

The patient presented in the ProMED post cited above is unlikely to suffer from viral hepatitis. The incubation period range of hepatitis A virus would be usually between 15 to 50 days (mean period, 28 days).

Since the earthquake occurred 10 days ago, I think typhoid fever can be added to the differential diagnoses list, for its shorter incubation period, possible hepatobiliary manifestations, baseline endemicity in the area, and the, reportedly, severe infrastructure damage to running water and sanitation lines.

A case of hepatitis appearing on 1 May 2015 would not be related to the earthquake of 25 Apr 2015, given published minimal incubation periods of 10 (hepatitis E) to 15 (hepatitis A) days.

[ProMED-mail thanks Drs Pandey, Kopel and Berger and for their comments. The posting was not meant to say that the reported case was acquired after the earthquake since the incubation period would be too short, but rather to show that ongoing probable viral hepatitis was occurring in the affected area. - Mod.LL
