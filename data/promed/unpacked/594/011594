LAHORE, 22 Jan 2001: Pakistan Agriculture Storage and Supplies
Corporation (Passco) fears a loss of [about] Rs 600 million as
[approximately] 800 000 sacks of wheat lying in the open have been
attacked by [a] pest. [Wheat (number of sacks)] at 10 different
[Passco] centres are: Barrikka (150 000); Mcload Ganj (120 000);
Minchanabad centre (110 000); Minchanabad -11 (25 000); Chabianna
90 000); Dhaak Pattan (80 000); Mandi Sadiq Ganj (66 000); Khosse (60
000); Fatahpur (50 000); Lambrian Wali Jhaal (50 000).
A highly-placed source said the wheat was under a severe pest attack
not controllable through pesticides. According to experts, the pest
attack turns the wheat poisonous. It can only be controlled if the wheat
is removed to [safe storage]. Sources said that if the situation remained
as it was now, [all] the wheat would become unfit for human
consumption.
The wheat is not only lying in the open but also on water-logged soil.
It could only remain in good condition for such a long time if stored in
air-tight stores. [A major factor in the outbreak was the delay in
transporting the wheat to proper storage facilities].

[From the information at hand, it seems likely that the pest is a fungus,
possibly one that induces the production of mycotoxins. My concern is
that individuals might use the grain for human consumption or as feed
for livestock. Government officials in Pakistan should take measures to
assess mycotoxin levels before the grain is fed to humans or livestock.
