Re: Equine infectious anemia (EIA), response no 9 from subscriber
"palettenfrans", Romania
----------------------------------------------------------------------
I cannot understand how unscrupulous these people can be.

Romania offers all horse breeders/keepers to have their horses tested
for EIA twice a year. Testing is carried out by official
veterinarians and is free of charge. Compensation is paid to the
owner for every positive horse if the owner gives it to a licensed
dealer who should then arrange slaughter, usually in Italy [where the
animal is exported to]. The Romanian government pays the dealer for
transport, paperwork, etc.

Here starts the rogue fraud of some dealers who, in spite of
perfectly knowing that the horses are EIA positive and after
collecting their payments from the State, resell positive horses.
Nobody should buy a horse from Romania without an EIA test!

This is indeed a "good" advertisement for us, Romania's horse breeders.

[The efficiency of the described procedure is rather questionable; if
interstate movement of positive-tested animals is indeed allowed by
EU legislation, stricter veterinary inspection upon the performance
of "licensed dealers" is urgently required. The issue deserves to be
revisited. See also item 2 below. - Mod.AS]

Final report of a mission carried out in Romania from 25-29 May 2009
in order to evaluate the implementation of animal health and animal
welfare rules in respect of trade in horses
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Executive summary (excerpts)
----------------------------
The report concludes that legislation for identification and movement
control of equidae is poorly applied and not enforced. Official data
do not match with the field situation. Strict legislation for
eradication of equine infectious anemia is in place and is partially
applied (testing campaigns, declaration of infected holdings), but is
not sufficiently controlled or enforced. Equidae are not killed or
slaughtered as compensations funds are not available or not
distributed, but also because of lack of slaughtering facilities.
They are not marked in such a way that they can be identified.
Movement restrictions of infected holdings are not controlled.
Equidae enter intra-Community trade through assembly centres, where
they are all tested for equine infectious anaemia, but not all at the
same time, thus mixing equidae of different health status. The
significance of this finding is enhanced by the facts that this
disease is endemic, infected equidae are not marked or slaughtered,
movement restrictions of infected holdings are not controlled, and
the identity and health status of the equidae arriving at the
assembly centre cannot be established in most instances.

The identification of equidae in assembly centres, using an
alternative unofficial system, the insufficient supporting evidence
regarding the health status of the equidae from the holdings of
origin, and the certification from the assembly centre which is
officially suspended, call into question the credibility of the
controls and the ability of the competent authority at all levels to
enforce the legislation.
