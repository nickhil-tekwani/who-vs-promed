Brazilian scientists say a virus is the main cause for the death of close to 200 grey dolphins in little more than 40 days on the coast of Rio de Janeiro state.

The School of Oceanography of the State University of Rio de Janeiro said in a statement that an outbreak of "cetacean morbillivirus" is responsible for the death of more than 170 grey dolphins in the Bay of Sepetiba since late November [2017]. The bay is about 45 miles (70 kilometres) west of the city of Rio de Janeiro.

This diagnose has been performed under the framework of the Catalonian Government's program for surveillance of marine mammal mortality

[Viruses in the Morbillivirus (MV) genus, Paramyxoviridae family, are envoloped, single stranded RNA viruses known to infect 3 mammalian orders: primates, carnivores and Cetartiodactyla (previously separated as 2 orders, Cetacea and Artiodactyla).

Several dolphin die-offs have been attributed to this pathogen in the seas from around the world. An acute form of the disease appears to occur during the die-offs, but following the outbreaks, unusual MV infections affecting only the central nervous system were reported.

According to Guardo (Front Microbiol. 2012; 3: 431), several cases of chronic infection by Dolphin Morbillivirus (DMV or CeMV) share striking features in common with human Measles Virus-related "Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis" (SSP), as well as with Canine Distemper Virus-related "Old Dog Encephalitis" (ODE), have been recently described in Mediterranean dolphins.
