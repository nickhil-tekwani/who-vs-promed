Georgia Department of Agriculture commissioner Tommy Irvin reported
12 Mar 2009 that laboratory tests confirmed a Georgia Paint horse [a
stallion - Mod.TG] is infected with contagious equine metritis (CEM),
a highly contagious, but treatable, venereal disease of horses.

"This is the 1st CEM positive horse in Georgia and the 13th stallion
in the nation since the announcement of the 1st positive case 15 Dec
2008," Irvin stated. "The Georgia stallion has been under quarantine
since 16 Jan 2009 and will continue to be treated and tested for
several weeks."

Carter Black III, DVM, Georgia's state veterinarian, said the Georgia
stallion that tested positive for _Taylorella equigenitalis_, the
bacterium that causes CEM, was in Wisconsin during the 2008 breeding
season with other stallions that had tested positive.

USDA Animal Plant Health Inspection Service Veterinary Service
reports that none of the positive horses have yet been identified as
the source of the outbreak; the epidemiologic investigation continues
to pursue all available information relevant to determining the
origin of this outbreak, but no conclusions can yet be drawn.

Other positive stallions include 3 in Indiana, 4 in Kentucky, 1 in
Texas, and 4 in Wisconsin. 3 mares were also positive, with 1 in
California, 1 in Illinois, and 1 in Wisconsin.

Nationally, locations have also been confirmed for 670 additional
horses exposed to _T. equigenitalis_. The 686 horses are located in
46 states. There are 121 exposed or positive stallions in 19 states
and 565 exposed or positive mares in 44 states. 8 exposed mares are
still actively being traced.

Sixteen stallions have now completed their entire testing and
treatment protocol and been determined to be negative for _T.
equigenitalis_.
