HK finds melamine in fish feed from mainland China
--------------------------------------------------
Hong Kong says it has found the industrial chemical melamine in a
sample of fish feed from mainland China. The Center for Food Safety
says that the feed contained melamine at a concentration of 6.6 parts
per million. It says a Hong Kong fish farmer bought the feed in
mainland China and delivered it to the city.

Melamine is found in plastics and fertilizer. The chemical has
recently turned up in dairy products and other foods. It has been
blamed for the deaths of 4 infants and for sickening more than 50 000
in mainland China.

The statement issued Tuesday [11 Nov 2008] says 8 fish at 4 farms
that have used the contaminated feed were tested. No ill effects were
found. It was not clear if any fish that consumed the tainted feed
had been sold to markets.

Contaminant found in fish feed from China
-----------------------------------------
Hong Kong food inspectors have found fish feed imported from China
contaminated with high levels of melamine, a toxic chemical that has
recently been blamed for tainting Chinese-produced milk, eggs and
other food products.

The Hong Kong government finding, reported late Tuesday [11 Nov
2008], is the latest indication that melamine, a chemical used to
make plastic and fertilizer, has seeped into large parts of China's
food and feed industry, posing potential health hazards to consumers.

This autumn, melamine-tainted milk caused the deaths of at least 4
children in China and sickened more than 50 000 children in China,
many of whom suffered from kidney ailments. Those incidents triggered
global recalls of Chinese dairy products and a nationwide
investigation into whether this country's food chain was tainted with melamine.

The Chinese government has moved aggressively to deal with the
scandal, blanketing the country with food inspectors, but
melamine-tainted food and feed products continue to turn up in
neighboring regions that trade with China.

Hong Kong officials have discovered melamine in milk, eggs and other
food products imported from China, and are now testing a wide range
of food and feed products for melamine. Inspectors said fish feed
imported from Fujian province in southern China was found to have
more than twice the level of melamine deemed to be safe for food, 6.6
parts per million. The acceptable level in Hong Kong and the United
States is 2.5 parts per million.

But Hong Kong officials also said in an announcement posted on the
government Web site that melamine-tainted fish feed would probably
not pose serious health problems for people who consumed fish because
consumers would not be directly eating the melamine. As a
precautionary measure, however, inspectors asked Hong Kong fish farms
not to use feed contaminated with melamine.

In late October [2008], newspapers in Viet Nam reported that tests on
240 tons of fish feed imported from China found traces of melamine,
but not high levels.

Last year [2007], thousands of pets in the United States were
sickened after eating melamine-tainted pet food ingredients imported
from China. That case led to the largest pet food recall in the United States.

China has blamed rogue food and feed dealers with intentionally
spiking milk and food supplies with melamine because the chemical
fools tests that measure protein levels. Some dealers use melamine as
a cheap feed substitute, perhaps not knowing its dangers.

But in interviews last spring, after the pet food scandal, melamine
scrap dealers -- who trade the melamine waste material to anyone who
will buy it -- openly admitted that melamine was often purchased by
feed companies and that it was widely used in the fish feed industry.

Toxic Chemical Is Found in Fish Feed in Hong Kong
-------------------------------------------------
Hong Kong safety officials found elevated levels of a toxic
industrial chemical in fish feed from mainland China, though they
said they haven't found the substance in fish.

Hong Kong's Centre for Food Safety said late Tuesday [11 Nov 2008]
the fish feed contained 6.6 parts per million of melamine, the
chemical at the center of China's tainted-milk scandal. Like many
other governments, Hong Kong limits the level of melamine in food
products to 2.5 parts per million.

But the center said tests of fish from four farms that used the feed
turned up satisfactory levels. The results are consistent with an
earlier study conducted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) that animal feed tainted with melamine had limited effect on
meat, the center said.

The chemical, used to make plastics and other goods, has been added
to powdered baby formula and other dairy products and has been blamed
for the deaths of at least 3 infants and the hospitalization of
thousands more. Since then, attention has turned to other types of
food. Last month [October 2008], Hong Kong officials found melamine
in eggs, leading to concerns about melamine-tainted animal feed and
the presence of the chemical in other parts of the food supply.

The center said the tainted fish feed came from Fuzhou Haima Feed
Co., in China's southeastern Fujian province. Company officials
couldn't be reached for comment.

Hong Kong safety officials said the city's agricultural and fisheries
department told fish farms not to use the feed and will continue
testing. Officials said they will also continue to test milks, eggs,
meat and other products.

Last year [2007], FDA officials said they found melamine in
Canadian-made fish meal containing what was labeled as wheat gluten
imported from China, contributing to tensions between the countries
over food safety. When added to food, melamine can make it seem more
protein-rich.

Separately, Hong Kong health officials said they were investigating
the cases of 2 4-year-old Hong Kong girls with kidney stones who had
consumed melamine-tainted milk products and biscuits. The girls were
treated and released, the city's Department of Health said.

[What is not well understood are the consequences of consumption of
the fish that have been fed this tainted meal. If the fish do not die
from the feed, does it really make them safe? Is there enough
evidence to support those claims? - Mod.TG]
