Danish cereals hit with rampant virus
-------------------------------------
Cereal growers across Demark have had crops clobbered by the worst barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) epidemic in a decade. Aphids are usually halted by falling autumn temperatures, but this [2014/15] season was the country's 2nd mildest autumn since 1874 and BYDV-carrying grain aphids had ideal conditions to spread the disease. In eastern Jutland, the distinct yellow and stunted patches typical of the virus are clearly evident in winter wheat and winter barley.

"I've never seen damage this bad," said a Danish grower who farms 700 ha [1730 acres]. Some neighbours had to plough in entire fields. Without easy access to seed treatment, as we do in the UK, the crop was exposed at its most vulnerable stage. [He] treated the crops once with foliar insecticide, but after that it was too wet to spray again.

In Denmark, cereals sown before 7 September can be recorded as a cover crop. [Therefore,] many growers have planted early. The combination of warm weather and early drilling represents the highest risk for BYDV infection. Cultural controls such as later drilling can be useful in high-risk situations.

Danish pesticide regulation [are] notoriously tight [and] to import treated seed is expensive. The Danish situation highlights the importance of seed treatments to protect against the devastating virus. [In the UK], 40 to 100 per cent of winter wheat and winter barley crops are treated. Peter Stacey, Bayer UK, says that the risk area is steadily moving north as the frequency of mild winters and wet summers increases. He says treated seed-stewardship is crucial.

[Barley yellow dwarf (BYD) disease occurs worldwide and is the most destructive of virus diseases of wheat. Grain yields may be reduced by one third. It attacks a wide range of grass species (_Gramineae_) including cereal crops like barley, wheat, oats, rice, maize and rye. Symptoms include leaf discolouration from yellow to purple (depending on the host species), stunting, reduced tillering, and empty seed heads. Plants infected in autumn may not survive the winter or show severe symptoms when growth resumes. Diseased plants often occur in circular patches within the field, which are associated with colonisation by the aphid vectors.

BYD viruses have now been split into several species in the family _Luteoviridae_ (mostly in the genus _Luteovirus_). They are differentiated by their ability to be transmitted by various aphid species and their virulence on a selected variety of oats. Some of the viruses are transmitted equally well by several aphids, whereas others can be transmitted by only one or 2 species. The viruses cannot be transmitted by seed, pollen, or mechanical means and cannot survive in stubble or in the soil. Volunteer cereal plants or grassy weeds may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Disease management includes use of resistant cultivars and control of the aphid vectors.

The seed treatment referred to above is a Bayer product (see link below), which is a combination of neonicotinoid containing insecticides and fungicides. It is used to strengthen early crops and provide BYD protection by extended aphid control. Neonicotinoid insecticides are regulated by many countries due to a risk of insects that act as disease vectors developing resistance and possible environmental effects (see also ProMED-mail post 20100220.0582).
