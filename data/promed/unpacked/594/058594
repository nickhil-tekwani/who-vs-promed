Antimalarial Drug Quality in the Most Severely Malarious Parts of
Africa -- A Six Country Study. PLoS ONE 3(5): e2132

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A range of antimalarial drugs were procured from private pharmacies
in urban and peri-urban areas in the major cities of 6 African
countries, situated in the part of that continent and the world that
is most highly endemic for malaria.

Semi-quantitative thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and dissolution
testing were used to measure active pharmaceutical ingredient content
against internationally acceptable standards.

35 percent of all samples tested failed either or both tests, and
were substandard. Further, 33 percent of treatments collected were
artemisinin monotherapies, most of which (78 percent) were
manufactured in disobservance of an appeal by the World Health
Organisation (WHO) to withdraw these clinically inappropriate
medicines from the market.

The high persistence of substandard drugs and clinically
inappropriate artemisinin monotherapies in the private sector risks
patient safety and, through drug resistance, places the future of
malaria treatment at risk globally.

[Substandard or even deliberately counterfeit drugs are a well-known
problem in both Africa and Asia. The lack of proper control and
widespread over-the-counter sale without contact with a pharmacist or
other health care personnel makes control difficult. The counterfeit
or substandard formulations can lead to suspicion of drug resistance
where in fact the drug was effective, but the formulation
administered was substandard or perhaps even contained no active
drug. - Mod.EP]
