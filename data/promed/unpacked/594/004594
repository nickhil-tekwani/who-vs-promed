Anthrax outbreak reported in southern Kyrgyzstan
Nine cases of anthrax have been registered in a village in Kyrgyzstan's
southern Dzhalal-Abad Region, according to an unnamed official in the
republic's Emergencies Ministry.
About 300 other villagers are known to have eaten the meat of a sick cow,
the agency said. All the patients have been taken to hospital, and
quarantine has been imposed in the village.

[The normal ratio is some 10 to 20 livestock cases before one sees a
cutaneous anthrax case. On the other hand if a number of families share a
butchered case, the GI ratio can go the other way if the meat is not
overcooked. The African experience is 1 in 64 of getting enteric anthrax
when eating such meat. Allowing for some cutaneous cases from butchering
this animal and then a few GI cases, the nine cases from one animal is
about right. But by the nature of this disease, an outbreak is unlikely to
be limited to one dead cow. - Mod.MHJ
