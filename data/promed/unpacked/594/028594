First report of cucumber black root rot caused by _Phomopsis sclerotioides_
in Italy
-------------------------------------
C Cappelli, Department of Arboriculture and Plant Protection, Perugia,
Italy; VM Stravato, G Carannante, Genista srl, Fondi (Latina), Italy; R
Parisella, Agronomist, Fondi (Latina), Italy. Plant Dis 2004; 88: 425,
published online as D-2004-0120-01N, 2004. Accepted for publication 18 Dec
2003.

During April 2002 to September 2003 in unheated plastic greenhouses located
in Fondi and Sperlonga (Latium Region of central Italy), in which more than
100 ha of cucumber (_Cucumis sativus_ L.) were cultivated, an unusual
disease causing decay of roots and plant wilting was observed. Many of the
most common cultivars showed susceptibility, and in some farms, severe
economic losses occurred.

Disease symptoms observed on young plants included stunting, wilting, black
root rot, and marked reduction of root development where pseudosclerotial
structures were produced. The degree of root symptoms was proportional to
the wilting. During periods of high evapotranspiration, wilting was severe
in plants at the early stages of disease development, and even lightly
infected plants wilted rapidly. Symptoms resembled those caused by vascular
wilt fungi and were generally more severe in greenhouses with poorly
drained soils.

Samples from each of 4 greenhouses were collected during different periods
of the growing season. Each sampling unit consisted of 5 to 8 root pieces
that were surface-disinfected in 0.1 per cent HgCl(2) for 30 s, rinsed in
sterile water, placed on petri dishes containing potato dextrose agar (pH
5.5), and incubated for 7 days at 25 deg C. _Phomopsis sclerotioides_ van
Kesteren (1,2) (identification confirmed by RA Samson, Centraalbureau voor
Schimmelcultures of Utrecht, the Netherlands) was consistently recovered
from affected tissues.

Subcultures of 3 isolates were prepared and evaluated for pathogenicity.
The experiments were conducted in a greenhouse with a 12 h photoperiod at
25 to 32 deg C. 7-week old seedlings (20 representatives per isolate) of a
susceptible hybrid were dipped for 2 min in an agar slurry suspension of
the pathogen and then returned to pots. Within 4 to 5 weeks after
inoculation, all plants inoculated with each _P. sclerotioides_ isolate
showed the same symptoms observed in the field and caused wilting and death
of about 80 per cent of the inoculated plants.

_P. sclerotioides_ was consistently reisolated from the symptomatic test
plant, whereas the fungus was never isolated from control plants. Another
experiment using naturally infested soil in comparison with sterilized soil
confirmed the soilborne nature of the fungus and its pathogenicity.

To our knowledge, this is the first report of _P. sclerotioides_ on
cucumber in Italy. According to the experience of farmers and agricultural
consultants, the disease was first observed in the last 3 to 4 years in
unheated plastic greenhouses. However, we cannot exclude the possibility
that the disease may have been present in central Italy prior to our
observations, since it can be misdiagnosed and the symptoms can be masked
by symptoms of other diseases.

For these reasons, an accurate monitoring of the pathogen is necessary to
determine the magnitude of the problem and its impact on the industry.
Management practices that include long-term crop rotation with
nonsusceptible hosts, removal and destruction of infected crop debris, and
steam soil sterilization are suggested to reduce the economic losses.

[Black root rot [Brr] is caused by the insidious, soil-borne fungus
_Phomopsis sclerotioides_ [Ps], which overwinters as black sclerotia in
soil and in thick root tissue that resist degradation. Brr is common in
greenhouse crops planted into cold soil at temperatures as low as 10-12 deg
C. The disease is uncommon in field crops. If Ps increases in glasshouse
production beds over several years, growers are advised to switch to
hydroponic production. Additional reference:
