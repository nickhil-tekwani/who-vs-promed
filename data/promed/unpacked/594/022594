New York City health officials said that there were more than a dozen confirmed cases of legionnaires' disease in one Queens neighborhood. 1 person living in Flushing remains hospitalized, and another 12 people from the neighborhood have been discharged, after contracting the pneumonia-like disease in recent weeks, according to the New York City Department of Health.

Doctors are already testing 2 other people who may also have the disease. No patients have died. Officials said the patients ranged in age from the late 30s to late 80s and most had serious underlying health conditions. No new cases have been seen since [19 Oct 2017].

Some 52 cooling towers are of concern, officials said. The health department said it is tested water from all cooling tower systems within the area and has ordered immediate remediation at towers with preliminary positive results, of which there were 10.

There are 200 to 400 cases of the disease in New York City every year, according to a 2016 report by the health department. Clusters of legionnaires' have cropped up around the city in recent years. In the summer of 2015, the largest legionnaires' disease outbreak in New York City history sickened more than 120 people, killing 12 of them, in the Morris Park neighborhood of the Bronx.

[New York City comprises 5 county-level divisions called boroughs: Manhattan, the Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn (Kings County), and Staten Island (Richmond County). A map of the 5 boroughs can be found at https://goo.gl/88QVCm.

Outbreaks of legionnaires' disease have occurred in the past several months in apartment complexes along Queens Boulevard in the adjacent Rego Park and Forest Hills neighborhoods of Queens (see ProMED-mail posts Legionellosis - USA (16): (NYC) fatal, apartment complex, RFI 20170924.5336870 and Legionellosis - USA (14): (NY) apartment complex 20170831.5287267).

The current outbreak described in the news report above is occurring in the Flushing neighborhood of Queens, which is located northeast of Rego Park and Forest Hills. A map of Queens showing the location of Flushing in relation to Rego Park and Forest Hills can be found at https://goo.gl/9X2hyu

We are not told what the 13 confirmed cases of legionnaires' disease have in common, for example, if they live in the same apartment complex, if they work in the same location, or visited the same locations, or have anything in common with the cases occurring in Rego Park or Forest Hills neighborhoods. ProMED-mail would appreciate more information in this regard from knowledgeable sources.

Genotyping the clinical isolates, if available, from the 13 cases of legionnaires' disease will help establish whether this is a common source outbreak. Matching the genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_ will identify the environmental source for the individual cases. - Mod.ML
