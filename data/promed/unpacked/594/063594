Monthly Creutzfeldt Jakob disease statistics - as of 2 Sep 2005
---------------------------------------------------------------
The Department of Health is today [5 Sep 2005] issuing the latest
information about the numbers of known cases of Creutzfeldt Jakob disease.
This includes cases of variant Creutzfeldt Jakob disease [abbreviated in
ProMED-mail as CJD (new var.) or vCJD], the form of the disease thought to
be linked to BSE. The position is as follows:
Definite and probable CJD cases in the UK:
Summary of vCJD cases - deaths
------------------------------
Deaths from definite vCJD (confirmed): 108
Deaths from probable vCJD (without neuropathological confirmation): 42
Deaths from probable vCJD (neuropathological confirmation pending): 0
Number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD (as above): 150
Summary of vCJD cases - alive
-----------------------------
Number of probable vCJD cases still alive: 7
Total
-----
Number of definite or probable vCJD cases (dead and alive): 157
(The next table will be published on Mon 10 Oct 2005.)

ProMED-mail
<promed@promedmail.org>
[Since the previous monthly statistics were released on Mon 2 Aug 2005, the
total number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD remains unchanged
(one case moving from the neurology pending to the neurology confirmed
category) at 150. The number of probable vCJD cases still alive remains
unchanged at 7. Therefore, the overall total number of definite or probable
vCJD cases (dead and alive) remains unchanged at 157.
These data are consistent with the view that the vCJD outbreak in the UK is
now in decline. The number of deaths due to definite or probable vCJD in
the UK during the 1st 8 months of 2005 remains at 2. The peak number of
deaths was 28 in the year 2000, followed by 20 in 2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in
2003, and 9 in 2004.
Totals for all types of CJD cases in the UK during 2005
---------------------------
As of 2 Sep 2005, 84 referrals of suspected CJD have been made in the UK
for the year 2005. There have been 35 deaths from sporadic CJD, one from
GSS (Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome), 2 from familial CJD, one
from iatrogenic CJD, and 2 from vCJD. Data for years since 1990 can be

UK: new surgical instrument cleaning method to reduce CJD risk
--------------------------------------------------------------
Scientists have developed a more effective way to rid surgical instruments
of the infectious agents that cause CJD in humans. The new technique can
remove prions to levels 1000 times lower than those achieved by existing
methods. Details of the University of Edinburgh work are published in the
Journal of General Virology [see: HC Baxter, et al. Elimination of
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy infectivity and decontamination of
surgical instruments by using radio-frequency gas-plasma treatment. J Gen
Virol 2005 86: 2393-9.
<http://vir.sgmjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/86/8/2393>. - Mod.CP]
The prion responsible for vCJD is widely distributed in the tissues of the
body's lymphatic and central nervous systems. The twisted prion proteins
are remarkably difficult to remove by standard decontamination processes.
This has raised concerns that surgical instruments used on lymphoid tissues
-- such as the spleen and tonsils -- could harbor the prion and pass it on
to patients on whom they are subsequently used. Other forms of CJD have
occasionally been transmitted by contaminated neurosurgical instruments.
Studies have shown that the standards of surgical instrument cleaning and
sterilization in British hospitals vary considerably. Although the
Department of Health has drawn up decontamination procedures for
instruments that may have been exposed to the CJD prion, it is recognized
that the guidelines are unlikely to remove all traces of infectivity.
Developing new methods for destroying prions is, therefore, of vital
importance.
The Edinburgh team used high energy forms of gas called plasmas to strip
the contaminating molecules from stainless steel surfaces. Radio waves were
used to excite the molecules of harmless gases. The excited molecules, and
the charged atoms called ions and radicals formed in the process,
effectively scour the surface of the instruments, breaking down traces of
biological tissue and converting them to non-toxic gases. Researcher
Professor Robert Baxter said: "This new technique is significant, because,
unlike viral and bacterial pathogens, prions are proteins which are
resistant to high temperatures and adhere very strongly to metal surfaces.
"Our integrated strategy aims to provide a new approach to decontamination
of surgical instruments and to ensure that decontamination is effective."
Professor Roger Morris, an expert in molecular neurobiology at King's
College London, said the Edinburgh technique used technology that was
compact in size, and affordable. He said effective decontaminating units
should soon be available for hospitals and even for smaller operations,
such as dental surgeries, to prevent the spread of CJD. "There is a very
real risk that CJD, present in the UK in relatively small numbers of
people, could be transferred to many others via contamination of surgical
instruments. We have lacked an effective way of removing infectious CJD
agent from surgical instruments, short of destroying the very expensive
instruments themselves. This timely breakthrough will be very important in
preventing the spread of CJD through contaminated surgical instruments."

Spain: further details of 1st Spanish case of vCJD
--------------------------------------------------
The Spanish Ministry of Health has reported the detection of a case of
variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) in Spain (1). The patient was a 26
year old woman in Madrid who died on 10 Jul 2005. She had no specific risk
factors for vCJD (no prior blood transfusions or visits to the United Kingdom).
The patient's symptoms began in November 2004, with rapid progression to
dementia, normal MRI and EEG, and 14-3-3 protein found in cerebral spinal
fluid. Other neurological manifestations including ataxia, dysarthria,
apraxia, and myoclonus appeared in early 2005. The 1st abnormal MRI was
observed in April 2005. The patient was methionine homozygous at codon 129
of the prion protein gene (PRPN). There were no identified PRPN mutations
or family history of CJD.
The case was notified to the Spanish CJD state registry in May 2005 and
initially fitted the criteria for both probable sporadic CJD (sCJD) and
possible vCJD; it was registered as probable sCJD. Brain neuropathology
results of tests conducted at Fundacion Hospital de Alcorcon at Madrid
subsequently confirmed vCJD. Materials have been sent to the European
reference center at the United Kingdom's National CJD Surveillance Unit in
Edinburgh for further study, and results are expected later in August 2005.

[The number of definite or probable vCJD cases in the UK (see above) is now
157, followed by France with 13, Ireland 2, and Italy, the Netherlands,
Portugal and Spain with single cases. Single cases have been confirmed also
in Canada, Ireland, Japan and the USA, involving patients with periods of
residence in the UK and who are presumed to have contracted infection in
the UK. The Japanese case is exceptional in that the patient may have spent
less than one month in the UK.
In addition, the US National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center
confirmed a vCJD diagnosis by analyzing a brain biopsy sample from a 33
year old Saudi man admitted to a hospital in Saudi Arabia. Although
detailed information on this patient was not available, he may have visited
the United Kingdom, if at all, only for several days. Thus, the patient may
have contracted the disease in Saudi Arabia after eating BSE-contaminated
cattle products imported from the United Kingdom (see: Belay, et al. Emerg
Infect Dis 2005; 11(9), Sep.
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol11no09/05-0371.htm>)
The occurrence of the 1st suspected human case of vCJD in Spain is not
unexpected, since the risk of contracting vCJD appears to be linked to the
amount of bovine meat consumed or extent of exposure to bovine products.
According to the latest figure compiled by the European Union and the OIE,
Spain ranks 5th in the world in terms of the number of BSE-affected cattle
(532), after France with 946, Portugal with 949, Ireland with 1470, and the
UK with 184 138. However, by contrast, in the current year [2005], Spain,
with 42 cases, ranks 2nd after the UK with 126 cases, followed by Ireland
with 29, Portugal with 17, and France with 2 cases of BSE. - Mod.CP]

[4] UK: human remains link to BSE

UK: human remains link to BSE
-----------------------------
The 1st cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or "mad cow
disease" could have been caused by animal feed contaminated with human
remains, says a controversial theory. Some raw materials for fertilizer and
feed imported from South Asia in the 60s and 70s contained human bones and
soft tissue, according to a report in the current issue of the Lancet. Bone
collectors could have picked up the remains of corpses deposited in the
Ganges river to sell for export. If infected with prion diseases, they
could have been the source for BSE. "I don't think anyone has thought about
the very rare but very important risk posed by the corpse of someone who
has died from a version of CJD," said Professor Alan Colchester, University
of Kent.
But the theory has been greeted with skepticism by several experts on BSE.
The authors admit their evidence stops short of proving their case, but
argue that their theory is plausible enough to warrant further
investigation. The appearance of a variant form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease (CJD) in humans [abbreviated as CJD (new var.) or vCJD in
ProMED-mail] has been linked to the BSE outbreak and is blamed for hundreds
of deaths. Prions, the abnormal proteins that cause CJD and vCJD in humans,
BSE in cows and scrapie in sheep, are remarkably resistant to both natural
decay and sterilization procedures.
The UK imported hundreds of thousands of tons of whole bones, crushed bones
and carcass parts in the 1960s and 1970s to make fertilizer as well as meat
and bone meal feed. Nearly 50 per cent came from Bangladesh, India, and
Pakistan, where gathering large bones and carcasses from the countryside
and from rivers is an established local trade. Hindu funerary practices
require that human remains are disposed of in a river, preferably the
Ganges. Although the body should ideally be burned, many people cannot
afford enough wood for a full cremation, the report's authors claim. Simply
smoking the pelvis in women and the torso in men is sometimes enough. And
many complete corpses are thrown into the Ganges.
"There are a whole range of public health concerns over Ganges pollution,"
lead author Professor Alan Colchester of the University of Kent told BBC
News. "But amongst all the recognition of potential problems, I don't think
anyone has thought about the very rare but very important risk posed by the
corpse of someone who has died from a version of CJD." Human remains have
been described in material delivered to processing mills. And during the
1960s, human material was confirmed in consignments of bones shipped into
French docks from Asia.
A spokesman for the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs
(DEFRA) said it went along with the findings of a 2001 report into the
origin of BSE, in which a favored hypothesis was that BSE had its origins
with scrapie. But the spokesman said the department was open minded about
new findings. Dr David Brown of the University of Bath, an expert in prion
diseases, told the BBC News website: "It's certainly a possibility that you
can't rule out completely, but I would say that, on a scale of probability,
it would be down at the low end." Professor Colchester estimates that about
120 Hindu people die from CJD each year. But Dr. Brown pointed out that the
poor, who might account for many corpses in the Ganges, also have a
relatively short life expectancy. Human prion diseases, meanwhile, often
present themselves in old age.
Professor Susarla Shankar, head of neurology at the National Institute of
Mental Health and Neurosciences in Bangalore, India, said he thought the
theory would not stand up to scientific scrutiny. "If this was so, you
would expect to find more cases of BSE in Indian cattle. At the moment, the
surveillance center doesn't have a single case," he told the BBC News
website. Bone collecting was a traditional practice, he said, but added
that even if some human material was making it into the raw materials for
animal feed, it would be so little as to be of scant consequence.
But only a tiny amount of contaminated brain tissue is needed to transmit
human CJD to nonhuman primates in the lab. On the other hand, nothing is
known about the transmission of human prion diseases to cattle. It was
shown in the 1980s that prion proteins could survive the entire chain of
processes leading to the production of animal feed in an infectious form.
The feeding of mammalian meat and bone meal to farm animals has been banned
since 1996. Yet sporadic cases of BSE have occurred in the UK and in
Europe, where regulations were also tightened, since the ban. These cases
remain unexplained.
Professor Bill Hill of the University of Edinburgh said the incidence of
the disease is falling and that it was hoped BSE could be eradicated
altogether by adhering to measures put in place to control the disease.

[The paper by Alan CF Colechester and Nancy TH Colchester, entitled "The
origin of bovine spongiform encephalopathy: the human prion disease
hypothesis," is published in The Lancet 2005; 366: Sat 3 Sep. The abstract
of the paper reads as follows. "The cause of the original case or cases of
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) remains an enigma. Sheep scrapie or
a previously undetected sporadic bovine transmissible spongiform
encephalopathy (TSE) have long been considered as candidates, but no
convincing evidence to support these proposals has come to light. We
present a new theory, with 3 related hypotheses: (1) that BSE was acquired
from a human TSE (prion disease); (2) that the route of infection was oral,
through animal feed containing imported mammalian raw materials
contaminated with human remains; and (3) that the origin was the Indian
subcontinent, from which large amounts of mammalian material were imported
during the relevant time period. Human remains are known to be incorporated
into meal made locally and may still be entering exported material. Further
investigations are needed into the sources of animal by-products used in
animal feed manufacture, and into the transmissibility of human TSEs." - Mod.CP
The paper includes an overview of the various theories on the origin of
BSE, namely:
1. Extrinsic origin (acquired from another species):
- a. Human TSE
- b. Sheep scrapie
- c. Other species (such as farm, zoo, game, or wild animal)
- d. Iatrogenic: contaminated medication transmitting TSE from another
animal (including human).
2. Intrinsic origin (spontaneous event within one or more individual animals)
3. Predisposing factors (factors that could predispose to an extrinsic or
intrinsic mechanism)
- a. Host factors
- b. Organophosphate pesticide exposure; high manganese or low copper
levels in soil, _Acinetobacter_ bacteria in cattle feed.
For the opinion of the Eu Scientific Steering Committee, Nov 2001,
"Hypotheses on The Origin and Transmission of BSE," see item 2 in
20020130.3437 and <http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/fs/sc/ssc/out236_en.pdf>.
Subscribers might be reminded that the inclusion of human tissue in
recycled animal feed was first discussed in April 1996, when a Swiss
television program, investigating the links between contaminated animal
feed and BSE, discovered that thousands of human placentas from hospitals
in Switzerland had been turned into animal feed since the 1960s.
Subsequently, the City council of Zurich launched an inquiry into how such
a practice, which breached hospital guidelines on waste disposal, could
remain undetected for so long. The department of health and environment in
Zurich indicated that they had evidence that 820 kilograms of human
placentas from 2 hospitals in Zurich were mixed in with dead pets and
turned into animal feed since the start of 1995. They added the same
disposal route was certainly used by hospitals in Winterthur and probably
by hospitals in other Swiss cities. (see "Swiss cows fed on human
placentas," New Scientist, Vol. 150 No. 2029, p. 4). It was further
reported that the Zurich canton veterinarian pledged to stop the practice
immediately and to consider prosecutions and that the feed producer had to
destroy 200 tons of MBMs in stock.
Was Switzerland the only country where such or similar practice prevailed?
