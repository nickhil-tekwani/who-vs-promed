In a little over 3 months, in what has been an unprecedented outbreak, Brazil has registered 399 cases of newborn babies with microcephaly, a neurodevelopmental disorder that can lead to serious problems with child development.

The data was published on Tuesday (17 [Nov 2015]) by the Ministry of Health. The cases have affected 7 states: Pernambuco, Sergipe, Rio Grande do Norte, Paraiba, Piaui, Ceara and Bahia.

In a normal year, Brazil registers 100 to 120 cases of newborn babies with microcephaly. "The annual average has been greatly exceeded," said Claudio Maierovitch, the director of monitoring of transmittable diseases at the Ministry of Health.

According to Maierovitch, it is "highly likely" that the unexpected increase is connected to a possible infection of the mothers with the Zika virus. This is a new disease identified in Brazil [in 2015], and is spread by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, the same mosquito that carries dengue viruses.

This connection was made following analysis of the test results of 2 pregnant women in Para√≠ba whose babies had been diagnosed with microcephaly while still in the womb. The results revealed the presence of the Zika virus in samples of amniotic fluid.

Other factors also suggest that the Zika virus is responsible. The mothers reported having red spots on their body during pregnancy, which is one of the signs of infection. The timing of the cases also coincides with the beginning of the spread of the virus in Brazil.

[It seems a bit premature to ascribe all of these microcephaly cases to Zika virus infections of pregnant women. Detection of this virus in amniotic fluid suggests that transplacental infection of the fetus can occur. However, congenital infections that pass from the mother to the fetus during gestation can occur with other etiological agents such as cytomegalovirus, rubeola virus and toxoplasmosis that need to be ruled out. As noted in the previous post, The Secretariat of Health Surveillance noted that rash occurs with dengue, Zika and chikungunya virus infections and stated that "It is irresponsible to say that these diseases are responsible for the microcephaly. Dengue is less likely. We are investigating. From the tomography findings, we attribute the cause as infectious, but it is too early to speak of it." (ProMED-mail archive no. 20151118.3799192).
