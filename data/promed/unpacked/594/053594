[see
Dengue - Venezuela (Caracas) 970209232503
Dengue - Venezuela (Caracas) (02) 970214133424
[extracted from a report by Mireya Tabuas in El Nacional, Caracas, 10 July
1997]
The number of cases of classic and hemorrhagic dengue have also increased
with a total of 444 cases and 3 deaths (two adults and one child) in Caracas
[The report is ambivalent. In one case all 444 cases were said to hemorrhagic
dengue. -- DMC] The areas most affected are: Antimano, La Vega, Caricuao,
Sucre, and El Valle. A number of cases were reported among patients in the
Lidice Psychiatric Hospital (the source there was found to be a water tank
that was the breeding ground for the mosquitoes).

[As for the Cuban outbreak, we still do not know the serotypes of dengue
viruses circulating in Venezuela. This is critical information. -- Mod CHC]
