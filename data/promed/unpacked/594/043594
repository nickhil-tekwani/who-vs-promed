The Health Protection Agency has received reports of 449 confirmed cases of
measles in England and Wales to the end of May 2006. This compares to 438
cases for the whole of 2003 and will therefore represent the highest number
of cases in one year since our current method of monitoring began in 1995.
In the year that MMR [measles, mumps, rubella vaccine] was introduced there
were just over 86 000 notifications of measles.
Dr Mary Ramsay, a consultant epidemiologist with the Health Protection
Agency, said, "We have been experiencing a number of localized outbreaks
this year, the largest of which have been in the Surrey and Sussex and the
South Yorkshire areas. These outbreaks have been amongst communities where
MMR uptake is lower and have also involved cases in traveling communities
who are more difficult to reach with health interventions such as vaccines.
Our local Health Protection Units are working closely with local health
services to try and increase uptake in these communities."
"Despite these outbreaks public confidence in the MMR vaccine is returning,
and coverage is increasing as a result. Coverage among 2-year-olds in June
2005 was 83 percent, up from 78.9 percent in January 2003. This is an
encouraging trend although much more remains to be done in order to ensure
that all children are fully protected. Parents should be reminded that is
not too late to get their child immunised with the MMR vaccine: a complete
course of 2 doses will protect their child against measles, mumps and rubella."

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. Keith Marshall for sending on the
official press release of the Health Protection Agency (HPA) on the ongoing
measles outbreak in the UK. As mentioned in earlier postings, the cases
have been in communities with lower vaccination coverage rates, notably
"travellers" communities. - Mod.MPP]
