[The following excerpts have been selected out of the oral report of
Hirotaka Akamatsu, Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries at
the above meeting, 14:00, 11 May 2010. - Mod.AS]

I visited Miyazaki yesterday [10 May 2010], met the Governor of
Miyazaki and quarantine staff, and heard about the problems they
face. I'd like to thank all the personnel who work day and night at
the farms and disinfection sites.

Miyazaki has 68 confirmed cases of FMD since 20 Apr 2010 [We are
informed that the number, as of 13 May 2010, has reached 86. - Mod.AS].

First, I will write about the status quo of the quarantine measures.
Until now, 20 cases have finished quarantine procedures such as
destroying and burying of animals, and sterilizing farms. The
procedure is underway in 7 additional cases. In order to carry out
these quarantine procedure quickly and effectively, the government
sent the personnel needed to Miyazaki Prefecture. For example, I sent
my staff to the Prefectural FMD Control Headquarters in Miyazaki to
stay there and control the situation, and sent veterinarians for
quarantine measures. A total of 952 persons have been sent to
Miyazaki as of today. Since the Governor of Miyazaki requested the
dispatch of Self-defense Force, members of JSDF have been working in
quarantine since 1 May 2010, and a total of 1150 members were
dispatched. According to the experts of the Committee on Cattle and
Swine Diseases, the cases seem to be limited within a 3 km-radius
inside the "control area" with 10 km in radius where movement of
animals is restricted, and the experts advise that the present
quarantine measures should be strictly followed.

In investigating the route of infection, an epidemiology team is
investigating on site and collecting and analyzing information on the
farms that had FMD cases and analyzed the virus. On 2 May 2010, the
virus in these Miyazaki cases were confirmed to be closely related to
those found in Hong Kong and S. Korea. We strongly support the
elucidation of the infection route from now on.

In Miyazaki and its neighboring prefectures of Oita, Kumamoto and
Kagoshima, disinfectants are delivered at the cost of the national
government and used. For prevention of FMD, disinfection and hygiene
in each and every farm is most important, and we ask them to carry
out the disinfection thoroughly. According to the urgent
questionnaire to the cattle and pig farms all over Japan, there are
no cases of FMD other than Miyazaki Prefecture as of 3 May 2010. We
keep encouraging every farm in Japan to stay alert and report quickly
through each prefectural government.

We are asking food industries to act properly. They should not
announce that the meat or milk are not safe, and should not stop
selling these products because of its imaginary danger. A total of
1700 food-labeling investigators from local agricultural offices
visited a total of 6371 retail stores as of 10 May 2010, and 3 stores
were found to have incorrect displays saying, "We don't use Miyazaki
beef," and they were instructed to remove or correct the display.

Next, I write about the measures for supporting farms that had FMD
cases or their neighboring farms. In order to support the farms
economically, MAFF gives allowance for suspected animals that were
slaughtered based on the Act on Domestic Animal Infectious Disease
Control. The loss in farms which are members of the Domestic Animal
Mutual Aid Association or the Domestic Animal Disease Prevention
Mutual Aid Foundation, is covered by the said establishments. In
addition, MAFF announced the relevant measures on 23 Apr 2010, and
the additional procedures were taken on 30 Apr 2010 due to the
increased number of cases and widened area.

As to the immediate funding, we expand the borrowers of the "loan for
maintenance of farming damaged by animal diseases" to farmers within
the area of outward movement restriction instead of farmers within
the area of movement restriction, and we also expand the credit line
from 2 billion yen to 10 billion yen [USD 21.6 million to 108
million]. For farmers who cannot move their animals outward the
restricted area, there are measures such as the "Special Program for
Stabilizing Beef Cattle Rearing Management" (so-called "Shin
Marukin") and exemption of producer contribution to the "Measure
Program for Stabilizing Swine Rearing Management" along with
subsidizing the slaughtered piglets that stay longer than expected in
nursery farms and the shipment of hogs that missed the appropriate
shipping period due to their overweight for marketing. In Miyazaki,
Oita, Kumamoto and Kagoshima prefectures, age requirements for
starting rearing beef cattle in the Subsidy Program for Beef Calves
Producers and those for registering cattle in the "Special Program
for Stabilizing Beef Cattle Rearing Management" are going to be
relaxed. Various other measures include subsidizing the agricultural
cooperative when it rears beef calves that cannot be shipped in the
abandoned farming land.

MAFF regards the prevention of disease spread at the highest priority
and takes proper measures, together with Miyazaki Prefecture and
relevant governmental agencies. We also provide correct information
to the Japanese people, and ask for their understanding and
cooperation. We will do our best in implementing financial support to
minimize the effect of this disease on the regional economy.

New outbreaks
[For the details of each of the 53 outbreaks covered in this
follow-up report, including starting dates, numbers of their
respective susceptible, diseased, dead and culled animals,
subscribers may refer to the original report at the above URL].

Summary of outbreaks:

May 2010. The total number of outbreaks is 76. Since all the
outbreaks occurred within the movement control areas established on
20 and 28 Apr 2010, it is considered that the infection is managed to
be contained in the limited areas. The National Institute of Animal
Health in Japan and the Institute for Animal Health in the United
Kingdom (OIE/FAO Reference Laboratory) affirmed that the FMD virus is
a closely-related strain with the viruses detected in the Republic of
Korea and Hong Kong in 2010.
