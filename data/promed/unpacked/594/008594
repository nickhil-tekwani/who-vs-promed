A high school in northern China has been shut down after an
unidentified virus killed a student and left dozens of others
hospitalized with high fevers, state press reported yesterday, 12 Apr
2006.
Medical officials have determined that the outbreak in Shaanxi
province is not bird flu but are still trying to identify the virus,
the Beijing Times reported. The illness was first noticed after 19 of
the students from Qishan county came down with high fever at the end
of March 2006.
One of the students from Yidian High School died after being sent to
the provincial capital of Xian for treatment and, by Mon, 10 Apr
2006, a total of 30 students had been hospitalized with high fevers,
the report said. Most of the fevers registered over 39 degrees
Celsius (102.2 degrees Fahrenheit), it added.
"At the moment we have ruled out the possibility of atypical
pneumonia and the bird flu, but the transmission of this disease is
getting stronger and the exact cause and source of the disease has
not been confirmed," an unnamed medical official was quoted as saying.
Officials at the school said the outbreak came after students had
participated in a sports meeting in cold weather.

[Inadequate information is given to assess a possible cause. Although
the posting uses the term "virus", the etiology of this cluster --
whether viral, bacterial or otherwise -- associated with a fatality
remains undetermined. Information that would be useful includes
associated signs and symptoms and a graph of cases over time.
This map shows the relationship of Shaanxi province to the provinces
around it, including Henan province, where another cluster of
