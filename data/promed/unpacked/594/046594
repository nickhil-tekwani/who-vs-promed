Cameroon is among several countries in West and Central Africa experiencing recurrent cholera outbreaks. Between 29 Oct 2021 and 30 Apr 2022, a total of 6652 suspected cases including 134 deaths (case fatality ratio 2%) have been reported. Several risk factors can be attributed to the ongoing cholera outbreaks in Cameroon, including wide circulation of _Vibrio cholerae_ in the country, limited access to safe drinking water in some areas, a seasonal pattern of cholera occurrence, and inadequate WASH (Safe water, sanitation, and hygiene) conditions.

Description of the outbreak:
Cameroon has been reporting suspected cases of cholera since the beginning of 2021. The outbreak was declared by health authorities on 29 October 2021 and has continued since then. As of 30 Apr 2022, 6652 suspected cases of cholera including 134 deaths (CFR 2%) have been reported from 6 regions: the South-West (4617 cases, 77 deaths), Littoral (1704 cases, 51 deaths), South (183 cases, 2 deaths), Central (125 cases, 4 deaths), North (15 cases, no deaths), and Far North (8 cases, no deaths) regions. Of the 6652 suspected cases, 5960 cases (90%) including 93 deaths (69%) have been reported in 2022. Between 29 Oct 2021 and 30 Apr 2022, a total of 1008 stool samples were tested from all 6 regions, and 40% (403) were confirmed positive for _Vibrio cholerae_ O1 by culture.

Although the cholera outbreak started in late October 2021, the number of weekly suspected cases increased from less than 200 in week 9 of 2022 (ending 6 Mar [2022]) to 1262 in week 12 (ending 27 Mar [2022]). The overall CFR reported so far in 2022 (CFR 2%) is lower than CFR reported in 2021 (CFR 3.6%); however, it remains higher than the CFR of 1% expected during a cholera outbreak when timely treatment is available. Furthermore, the Central and Littoral regions continue to report high CFRs (CFR 2.9% and 3%, respectively).

While 2 regions, Central and South-West, reported cases of cholera in 2021, there has been a geographical expansion of the outbreak to 5 regions (Central, Littoral, North, South, South-West) since March 2022.

As of 30 Apr [2022], the South-West region continues to be the most-affected region with 4617 cases (69%) including 77 deaths (CFR 1.6%), of which 4069 cases (88%) were reported in 2022. Littoral is the 2nd-most-affected region with 1704 (26%) cases and 51 deaths (CFR 3%), including 1684 (99%) cases reported in 2022.

Epidemiology of cholera:
Cholera is an acute enteric infection caused by ingesting the bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_ present in contaminated water or food. It is mainly linked to insufficient access to safe drinking water and inadequate sanitation. It is an extremely virulent disease that can cause severe acute watery diarrhea resulting in high morbidity and mortality, and can spread rapidly, depending on the frequency of exposure, the exposed population, and the setting. Cholera affects both children and adults and can be fatal if untreated.

The incubation period is between 12 hours and 5 days after ingestion of contaminated food or water. Most people infected with _V. cholerae_ do not develop any symptoms, although the bacteria are present in their feces for 1-10 days after infection and are shed back into the environment, potentially infecting other people. Among people who develop symptoms, the majority have mild or moderate symptoms, while a minority develop acute watery diarrhea with severe dehydration. Cholera is an easily treatable disease. Most people can be treated successfully through prompt administration of oral rehydration solution (ORS).

Cholera can be endemic or epidemic. A cholera-endemic area is an area where confirmed cholera cases were detected during the last 3 years with evidence of local transmission (cases are not imported from elsewhere). A cholera epidemic can occur in both endemic countries and in non-endemic countries.

The consequences of a humanitarian crisis -- such as disruption of water and sanitation systems, or the displacement of populations to inadequate and overcrowded camps -- can increase the risk of cholera transmission, should the bacteria be present or introduced. Uninfected dead bodies have never been reported as the source of epidemics. A multifaceted approach including a combination of surveillance, water, sanitation and hygiene, social mobilization, treatment, and oral cholera vaccines is essential to control cholera outbreaks and to reduce deaths.

Public health response:
WHO has deployed teams of experts to support the response and is providing technical, logistical, and financial support to the government. In addition,
- the national incident management system is conducting regular coordination meetings with partners at the central and regional levels to support district teams;
- a response plan was developed by the Ministry of Health and includes response partners;
- cholera kits have been provided to aid the response;
- advocacy meetings continue to be conducted with local and international partners;
- response teams were deployed to major outbreak sites to support the response activities and conduct investigations;
- from 18 to 23 Feb [2022], the 1st round of an oral cholera vaccine (OCV) campaign was organized in 4 health districts in South-West region. This campaign targeted 204 800 people with 85.5% administrative coverage. The vaccination campaign was extended to 11 more districts in the Littoral, South, and the South-West regions from 8 to 12 Apr 2022, targeting 842 086 people with an administrative coverage of 89%. This was combined with WASH interventions including distribution of water purification tablets (Aquatabs);
- mass chemoprophylaxis with OCV was performed in a prison region where a cholera outbreak was reported in late March [2022];
- surveillance activities have been strengthened for active case-finding and patient referrals in affected districts;
- decontamination of outbreak sites and households of confirmed cases have been conducted;
- community members and leaders were trained on hand washing, purification of water, and disinfection of homes and public spaces.

WHO risk assessment:
Cameroon is among several countries in West and Central Africa experiencing recurrent cholera outbreaks. Several risk factors, including circulation of _Vibrio cholerae_, especially in the North, Littoral, Central, and South-West regions, limited access to safe drinking water in some areas including in the capital city of Yaound√©; in addition, cultural practices that contribute to unsafe WASH conditions exist in the country. There is a seasonal pattern of cholera occurrence in Cameroon that varies by region. In South-West and Littoral, currently the most-affected regions, cholera is most often reported during the rainy season (November-April) or the transition between the rainy and the dry season. In the Central region, cholera is more frequently reported during the rainy season that occurs in May-June and October-November. The ongoing rainy season may increase the likelihood of further transmission in the country.

In addition, some affected areas of the country are insecure, which further reduces the access to services, making outbreak response more complex.

The cholera outbreak began surging in late October 2021 and deteriorated further in March 2022 with the South-West region reporting 70% of cases. Limited geographic accessibility of some areas, security constraints, and suboptimal communication networks lead to irregular epidemiological updates and potential underreporting of cases. Additionally, high population movement of internally displaced persons (IDPs), weak health systems, insufficient human resources, poor knowledge of treatment protocols, and low risk communication for cholera continue to pose challenges.

Furthermore, in the northern areas, Cameroon is bordered by Adamawa, Borno, and Taraba states of Nigeria, and there is frequent and substantial cross-border movement, posing a risk of transmission. There is also a risk of further international spread especially to the Republic of Chad, which borders both Nigeria and Cameroon.

The country is conducting cholera vaccination, which should help contain the outbreak; however, additional efforts supplemented by other interventions including access to adequate treatment and clean water are needed in order to control the outbreak.

WHO advice:
WHO recommends improving access to clean water and sanitation, good waste management, food safety practices, and hygienic practices to prevent the transmission of cholera. Oral cholera vaccines should be used in combination with improvements in water and sanitation to control cholera outbreaks and for prevention in areas known to be high risk for cholera.

Strengthening surveillance, especially at the community level, is advised. Appropriate case management, including improving access to care, should be implemented in outbreak-affected areas to reduce mortality. There is a need to ensure that countries are ready to quickly detect and respond to this cholera outbreak to reduce the risk of spread to new areas. Setting up oral rehydration points (ORPs) in communities is also critical to provide early management through oral rehydration, screening, and referral of patients. As the outbreak is occurring in border areas where there is significant cross-border movement, WHO encourages the respective countries to ensure cooperation and regular information sharing.

International travel or trade: WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and trade to and from Cameroon based on the information available on the current outbreak.

On 23 Apr 2022, the government reported cholera cases in Uvinza DC (Kigoma region) and Tanganyika DC (Katavi region). By 28 Apr 2022, the outbreak had spread to other areas along the lake shores of Lake Tanganyika with a total of 129 symptomatically suspected cases, 8 of which were confirmed. Most of the affected locations are fishing villages with poor sanitation practices that include open defecation and densely populated areas which lack adequate sanitation with poor access to clean and safe water, posing a danger for further spread of the epidemic. Zero fatalities have been reported to date.

Since the government declared a cholera outbreak on 7 May 2022, there is a gradual increase in the number of cholera cases in Bentiu, Rubkona county (Unity State). As of 15 May [2022], 70 suspect cholera cases have been reported, mainly in the internally displaced persons (IDPs) camps. Rubkona county experienced unprecedented floods in 2021, and critical WASH conditions for 170 000 people displaced in the Bentiu camp (ex-protection-of-civilians site) and settlements.

Though the current transmission is sporadic, the risk of transmission to at-risk counties is very high due to population movements, presence of IDPs, persistent flooding, and low access to safe water and sanitation.

This is the first cholera outbreak since December 2017, which marked the end of an epidemic declared in June 2016 and killed 436 people.

At least 1700 people were infected with cholera in the village, which is located in the mountainous region of Dera Bugti, after local residents used contaminated water due to old and rusted pipelines. As per the official records, at least 4 people have died in the cholera epidemic, but the local residents claim that at least 20 have died and thousands have been infected. There is no independent confirmation of the situation.

The provincial government claimed on Friday [13 May 2022] that the situation was under control, but local residents and civil society took to social media platform to highlight the scarcity of potable water in the village. A group of local residents and civil society on Sunday [15 May 2022] staged a protest demonstration against the shortage of water in Pir Koh village outside the Quetta Press Club. They chanted slogans and demanded of the government to act before the situation results in yet another tragedy, because the weather was unusually hot, and the old water supply line has been disconnected.

The Dera Bugti district health officer, Muhammad Azam Bugti, said that potable water was pumped to the village via a 12 km [7.5 mi] pipeline constructed by Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd (OGDCL) 32 years ago, and it was never ever repaired or replaced. As a result, the entire pipeline was completely rusted. "The rusted pipeline is the main reason of the contamination of the drinking water," he said, adding that many water-borne diseases were widespread in the area because of it.

Local residents said that the ill-equipped hospitals in the district were also a problem.

Two sitios (places) in Colongulo village, Surallah town, South Cotabato, were placed under a state of emergency on Saturday [14 May 2022] because of a cholera outbreak. Colongulo village councillor Roger Maguad, who is also the chairman of the Committee on Health in the said village, said at least 60 families have been infected with cholera in Sitio Villa Ellaga and Sitio Basag. The cholera outbreak was confirmed in the area after the municipal health office (MHO) of Surallah conducted a water sampling and rectal swab of patients who had experienced symptoms of the disease.

Based on the MHO-Surallah's water-sampling procedure, it was found that 2 out of the 3 water sources in the area are positive for cholera bacteria. Aside from this, the MHO-Surallah also found out that the farm snails, which the residents in the area commonly eat, are also positive for cholera.

Maguad also said that a child has died in the area, which has been attributed to the cholera outbreak.

[As stated by Lutwick et al. (Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P. Cholera. In Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Edited by Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J. New York: Nova Bioscience; 2017, pp 113-127), oral rehydration therapy can be lifesaving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Guerrant et al. (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it first recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al. (1) highlight the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30% to 3.6% (4) and quote sources referring to ORT as 'potentially the most important medical advance' of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally, glucose or rice powder based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 mL/kg followed by 100 mL/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 mL/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
