-------------------------------------------------
In Cuba, 678 cholera cases including 3 deaths had been registered between epidemiological week (EW) 27 of 2012 and EW 34 of 2013 [1 Jul 2012-24 Aug 2013]. Since 24 Aug 2013, no new cases have been reported [officially - Mod.LL]

In the Dominican Republic, since the beginning of the epidemic (November 2010) through epidemiological week (EW) 6 of 2014 [8 Feb 2014], there have been a total of 31 521 suspected cholera cases, including 467 deaths. Between EW 1 and EW 6 of 2014, there have been 46 suspected cholera cases and no deaths, registered at the national level, with a decreasing trend. This is considerably less than the number of new case registered in the same period of 2013 (646 cases and 8 deaths). 2 of the provinces, Santo Domingo and Santiago, registered 65 percent of all of the cases notified in the 1st weeks of 2014.

In Haiti, since the beginning of the epidemic (October 2010) and until EW 6 of 2014 [8 Feb 2014], there have been 699 197 cholera cases, of which 391 074 were hospitalized (55.9 percent) and 8549 died. The cumulative case-fatality rate remains 1.2 percent, with variations ranging from 4.5 percent in the department of Sud Est to 0.6 percent in Port-au-Prince. In the 1st 6 weeks of 2014, 2536 cholera cases had been recorded, including 18 deaths (the cumulative case fatality rate for 2014 is 0.7 percent). The weekly average of cases has reached 422 with 3 deaths; this is considerably lower than what was registered in 2013, with a weekly average of 1140 cases and 9 deaths. Although an increasing trend had been observed in the last weeks of 2013, coinciding with the rainy season, the 1st 6 weeks of 2014 have shown a decreasing trend in cases and deaths.

In Mexico, between EW 37 to EW 51 of 2013 [8 Sep-21 Dec 2013], 187 cases of infection by _Vibrio cholerae_ O1 Ogawa toxigenic cases were registered, including 1 death. No new cases have been reported since 15 Nov 2013.
