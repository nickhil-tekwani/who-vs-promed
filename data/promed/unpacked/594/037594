291 pigs culled in Chiayi to ward off suspicious FMD cases: COA
---------------------------------------------------------------
A total of 291 pigs have been culled in Chiayi City after cases of
suspected foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) were detected in the southern
city 2 days ago, a Council of Agriculture (COA) official said Sunday
[29 Mar 2009]. Staff members from the COA's Bureau of Animal and
Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine spotted several pigs showing
suspicious symptoms of FMD disease Friday [27 Mar 2009] during a
routine inspection of the Chiayi meat market, the official said.

The Chiayi city government was immediately alerted and took response
measures by tracking the source of the ailing pigs, which were from a
farm in neighboring Chiayi County [Taiwan Province], and prohibiting
movement of pigs from that farm, the official said. On Saturday [28
Mar 2009], the official went on, the pigs showing suspicious FMD
symptoms and other pigs kept in the same enclosure in the farm were
culled, while the remaining pigs in the farm were given shots of
vaccines.

Pigs raised in farms located within 1 km (0.6 mi) from the suspected
FMD-affected farm have also been vaccinated, the official said, adding
that a field survey of the 25 hog farms located within a 3 km (2 mi)
radius of the suspected FMD-affected spot showed that all of them
operate normally without any suspicious signs of the spread of the
virus.

According to the official, the COA is still examining the samples
collected from the slaughtered pigs and has not yet determined
whether they had been infected by the FMD virus.

Earlier this year [2009], some pigs from 2 farms in central Taiwan
were found to have been infected with FMD virus. That outbreak has
already been resolved.

[Taiwan is aggressively going about eradicating FMD from their island
country; see ProMED-mail archive no. 20090219.0689. Vaccinating
around an infected farm is necessary, not just because this disease
is very contagious but also because pigs put out significantly more
FMDV than cattle or sheep. Downwind aerosols from infected pig farms
are a very real risk. Hopefully this outbreak, if it is FMD, is of
the same serotype O that they reported on 19 Feb 2009. Chiayi is
south of Chang-Hua and Yun-Lin counties and essentially adjoining
these 2 affected counties.

Taiwan, and the affected counties in Taiwan Province, can be located
on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at

There are a numerous other vesicular diseases that resemble FMD in the
early stages, including Swine Vesicular Disease, Vesicular Stomatitis
Virus and vesicular exanthema of swine, to name a few. It is important
that the samples be fully examined and which disease was present
determined. Control measures, expectations for the future and possibly
reporting status to OIE and other trading partners are also at stake.
