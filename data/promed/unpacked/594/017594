The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) is today (July 20) investigating a suspected case of botulism, and again stressed to the public that such injections should only be prescribed and performed by registered doctors.

The female patient, aged 42 with good past health, has developed swallowing difficulties and upper limb weakness beginning on 11 Jul 2016. She attended the Accident and Emergency Department of United Christian Hospital yesterday [19 Jul 2016] and was admitted on the same day. She was found to have upper limb muscle weakness on admission. Her clinical diagnosis was suspected iatrogenic botulism and she is currently in stable condition.

According to information provided by the patient, she had received injections to her bilateral calves for slimming purposes in a beauty premises in Shenzhen, Guangdong on 8 Jul 2016 but she was uncertain whether the injection received was botulinum toxin. "We have no evidence at this stage that patients of the 8 recent cases so far had received injections in the same premises. Epidemiological investigations are ongoing," the spokesman added. "We have been maintaining close liaison with Mainland health and drug regulatory counterparts to identify if there are similar cases. We acknowledged that the health authority of the Mainland had taken follow-up measures," the spokesman said.

The DH urged the public to observe the health advice below before receiving botulinum toxin injections:
-Injections should only be performed by locally registered doctors;
-Understand the procedure, potential risks and complications before receiving botulinum toxin injections.

"Those who must receive injections outside Hong Kong should pay special attention to ensure that practitioners are qualified or registered with relevant jurisdictions. If in doubt, stop using or receiving the injection immediately. Promptly consult qualified healthcare professionals if feeling unwell," the spokesman added.

[A cluster of botulism cases, primarily from injections on the mainland in Guangdong Province, have been reported in Hong Kong. This case may well be another.

Botulism can occur from other injections, usually illicit drugs especially black tar heroin or from open wounds not debrided properly. - Mod.LL
