WHO Dengue Bulletin Volume 32 (2008): Supplement on 'Burden of
Chikungunya and Dengue'
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The WHO Dengue Bulletin (ISSN 0250-8362) is a peer-reviewed,
open-access journal, which has been published by the South East Asian
Regional Office (SEARO) of the World Health Organization (WHO) for
over 3 decades.

Indexed by BIOSIS, Compendex, EMBASE, Geobase, Google Scholar,
Scopus, etc., it is available in both print and online versions (on
the WHO website). Manuscripts received for publication are subjected
to in-house review by professional WHO experts as well as by external
experts from around the world.

The SEARO/WHO is bringing out a special supplement to Volume 32
(2008) on 'Burden of Chikungunya and Dengue'. This issue will
primarily feature invited articles (short notes as well as
full-length papers) from authors who presented their work in the 1st,
2nd, 3rd, and 4th symposia on the 'Burden of Neglected Diseases' at
Ahmedabad (India), Brasilia (Brazil), Madurai (India), and Kuala
Lumpur (Malaysia) respectively. Articles not part of the symposia
will also be considered if they are relevant to the theme.

We cordially invite you to submit your manuscript (full-length paper
or short note) for this supplement. We believe that publication in
this special issue would be beneficial due to the quick review, the
inter-relationship of the papers, and the stature of the publication
and its publisher. This open-access issue will be archived on the WHO
website, and contain several highly cited papers in one place.

Kindly e-mail your paper's title, list of authors with their
affiliations, and a brief abstract (less than 300 words) to the guest
editors <vasan.seshadri@eng.ox.ac.uk> and <shepard@brandeis.edu>
before 15 Aug 2009. Please send a copy to
<viswanathank@searo.who.int>. The deadline for receiving manuscripts
is 1 Oct 2009.

All articles will be subject to usual peer review, but on a
fast-track basis as the issue is expected to go to press on 1 Dec
2009. For links to manuscript preparation guidelines and sample
papers, please see
<http://www.searo.who.int/en/Section10/Section332/Section2270_13892.htm>

We look forward to receiving your article.
