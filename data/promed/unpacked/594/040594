At least 57 people are on the sick list after an outbreak of salmonella in
Hobart. The wave of food poisoning is believed to have forced dozens of
Tasmanians on to workers' compensation leave while they recover. Of the 22
cases statewide confirmed by testing in the past fortnight [2 weeks -
Mod.LL], 13 were linked to the Hobart outbreak, the Department of Health
and Human Services said. But as of yesterday, 8 Dec 2005, there were 57
people off sick with the symptoms in Hobart.
Raw egg has been named the likely culprit for the Hobart attacks, but the
State Government maintained there was no need to reveal the suspected food
business at the heart of the outbreak.
"There is no public health reason to identify the business," Public Health
Director Roscoe Taylor said. "It acted to prevent further risk as soon as
it was made aware of the problem last Fri, 2 Dec 2005, so we don't expect
any new outbreaks from this source."
