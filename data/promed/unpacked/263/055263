Dr. Gerry Predy, public health officer with the Capital Health Authority in
Alberta was cited as saying that six people between the ages of three and
19 were treated for _Salmonella_ infections in Edmonton between March 15 and
March 30 after eating cheese in pre-packaged lunches and no cases have been
reported since March 30, so Predy believes the recalls have been effective
in containing the outbreak.
Dr. Jean Kamanzi of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency was cited as saying
that the cheeses were recalled Wednesday because they were made in the same
plant during the same period as the cheese in Lunchmate products, adding
that other cheese products on store shelves should be safe and, "People
shouldn't be worried."
The stories says that scientists at the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and
local health officials are confident the nationwide outbreak of salmonella
poisoning has been contained through a recall of cheese products across the
country.
Kamanzi was further quoted as saying, "We are moving away from the idea of
cross-contamination, such as chicken with cheese. But of course, we cannot
rule it out."
