Even as government officials express confidence that researchers know the key facts about Ebola, many questions crucial to preventing an outbreak in the United States remain unanswered, scientists told a workshop at the National Academy's Institute of Medicine in Washington on Mon [3 Nov 2014]. Virtually all the unknowns have practical consequences, participants emphasized, making it foolish and perhaps dangerous to base policy on weak science... - more

[What the experts are reported to have said above about possibilities was quite correct, but they are just possibilities. There is only hard evidence at the moment for contact transmission between humans (and between bushmeat and humans), contact meaning contact with mucosal membranes (e.g. of the eye, nose or mouth) or broken skin with the blood or some body fluids of an infected person or animal. Note that the fact that Ebola virus has been found in sweat and saliva does not mean that it is there in sufficient quantity to infect anyone.

Pronouncements about possibilities do not help policy-makers make sound policy for proven threats, they merely feed the media hype that is resulting in paranoia in the USA & Europe, and leads for example to carabinieri wearing PPE to welcome US troops at arms length on their return from West Africa to their quarantine quarters in Italy, as if they were exhaling ebolavirus (see ProMED Ebola virus disease - ex Africa (26): USA quarantines, drug, vaccines, WHO 20141027.2906997), and to a US judge issuing a temporary ruling that a symptomless nurse who had a negative Ebola test had to stay at least 3 feet away from other people; see http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/ebola-virus-outbreak/kaci-hickox-humbled-maine-judges-ebola-ruling-n238326. The finding that Ebola was probably transmitted through the air between pigs and monkeys caged in a lab does not prove that the same could happen between people in crowded public spaces or transport; that's only another possibility, but policy is being based on it.

Yesterday [3 Nov 2014] was the 21st day since nurse Vinson flew back to Dallas from her pre-wedding shopping trip to Cleveland (ProMED Ebola virus disease - ex Africa (17): USA (TX) 2nd nurse update 20141015.2868385), and none of her 130 co-passengers have been reported to have had a significant fever. But good news of this sort does not make headlines. Meanwhile, in view of the concerns of people worried about unconfirmed possibilities (they are not even probabilities), unfortunately promulgated by experts, those responsible for public heath will continue to be guided by what the most vocal of the public demand, regardless of science but rather taking into account the effect on state and local voters and the impact on state and local hospitals, their health budgets, and the economy. - Mod.JW]

[2] USA: Unnecessary precautions by school

A teacher at St. Margaret Mary Catholic School who had recently returned from a mission trip to Kenya has resigned amidst swirling frustration and fears about Ebola. Susan Sherman was not immediately available Mon [3 Nov 2014] to comment on her resignation. Cecilia Hart Price, chief communications officer for the Archdiocese of Louisville, confirmed that Sherman resigned and that St. Margaret Mary's principal has already begun the process to try to fill the teaching position.

The school had asked Sherman to take a paid "precautionary leave" of absence of 21 days upon her return from her trip after "strong [school] parent concerns" about Ebola. It also asked Sherman, who is a registered nurse, to provide a doctor's note stating she was in good health. There have been no reported cases of Ebola in Kenya. Indeed, the archdiocese, in a statement released last month [September 2014] regarding Sherman's trip, noted that the Kenyan village where Sherman was working -- the remote village of Migori -- is "in Eastern Africa, thousands of miles from West Africa, where the main outbreak of the virus is located."...

Last week, Paul Sherman sent a letter to Archbishop Joseph Kurtz complaining that "unfounded fears" of some parents and parish staff "are triumphing over truth and reason." He said he and his wife offered to give an educational meeting about Ebola and about their medical mission trip, but they "were put off until our 'quarantine' is over." Steve James, founder of Kenya Relief, said he's only had one other mission trip participant experience a negative reaction upon returning home. He said all the other members of the team that went to Kenya have returned to their jobs with no problems... "We don't have Ebola in Kenya," James said. He said it's unfortunate when people making decisions "haven't paid attention to the facts."...

Last month [September 2014], a Dallas Certified Nursing Assistant claimed her employer sent her home because her daughter had visited from Kenya. A bridal shop in Akron, Ohio closed temporarily after it learned that a nurse who was later diagnosed with Ebola had shopped there...

[It is a sad reflection on the state of geography education in Kentucky at the close of the 20th century (when those parents were in school). I hope today's teachers will point out to their pupils that Kenya does not have any cases of Ebola, and besides, Kenya is over 2500 miles further away by air from the Ebola-infected countries in West Africa as Louisville is from the closest Ebola case (in New York, 650 miles).

If the reason for parental concern is the possibility that an infected passenger might have arrived undetected in Kenya during her visit (Kenya has been designated a high risk country by WHO), will the school require 21-day leave for any staff member returning from travel to New York City, given the possibility that another asymptomatic infected health worker like CS -- or somebody else incubating Ebola -- might arrive back there any day now? - Mod.JW]

[3] USA: Boston hospitals divide load
Date: 29 Oct 2014

Boston's top teaching hospitals are rejecting calls that one of them be designated as the state's primary Ebola treatment hub, saying that staff and space requirements would prove too burdensome, specialists from 3 institutions said Tue 29 Oct 2014. But the hospitals, among the most esteemed medical centers in the country, stressed that they would be willing to open their doors to small numbers of patients stricken with the viral disease. In a conference call last week, the state Department of Public Health floated the idea of having patients with Ebola symptoms transferred to a single regional center for treatment in Massachusetts, according to 2 people who were on the call. Instead, the hospitals suggested patients be spread among their facilities. The state health agency declined to comment on the call.

The fraught discussions over where to treat Ebola patients reflect the medical complexity of caring for those patients and the costs, in terms of finances and image, to hospitals. After a Texas hospital treated an Ebola patient from Liberia, other patients cancelled outpatient procedures, and business in the emergency room slowed, according to Dallas media reports.

"Each organization [in Massachusetts] was ready and prepared to serve their community," said Dr. Eric Goralnick, medical director of emergency preparedness at Brigham and Women's Hospital. "But we seem to come to agreement at this point that redundancy is important, and having multiple centers able to care for one or 2 patients is the right approach." The Brigham, Goralnick said, could treat one Ebola patient at a time. Massachusetts General Hospital said it could take up to 4. Boston Medical Center can handle 2-4. Our physical layout limits our capacity to a very small number of patients," said Dr. Stanley Hochberg, Boston Medical Center's senior vice president for quality, safety, and technology. "Wherever we place the patient, we would have to put that unit or parts of that unit out of service. We believe we can care for these patients," Hochberg added. "We are comfortable we can protect our staff. But it strains our ability to take care of all our other patients." Boston Medical Center is building a 3-bed biocontainment unit similar to those where Ebola patients have been treated in Omaha and Atlanta, but it will not be ready for at least 7 months, Hochberg said.

Dr. Paul Biddinger, medical director of emergency preparedness at Massachusetts General, said he also believes care should be divided among hospitals, given the burden on staff and finances in treating patients with the disease. "More than one hospital can do this in Boston," he said. "I am an emergency planning guy, and I believe in redundancy, so to have one place to be the receiving hospital doesn't make sense. To have a handful of tertiary hospitals that have the capacity to respond makes more sense."

Alternative approaches were suggested on the call with the Department of Public Health, Goralnick said, such as building a specialized unit at a military base or in a vacant hospital, or at a Veterans Administration hospital. These units could be staffed by different hospitals' medical workers, who would volunteer for such work.

Caring for an Ebola patient requires considerable space. In addition to the patient's room, there must be a "clean room" for donning protective equipment and a "dirty room" for taking it off, plus space for supplies and disposal of waste and possibly a laboratory nearby. All must be separated from other patients. Nebraska Medical Center, which has cared for 2 Ebola patients, required 40 to 60 staff members for each case; 5 medical workers tended to a single patient during each 12-hour shift, plus laboratory and other staff. Although the Omaha hospital's unit has 10 beds, officials said they would not handle more than 2 Ebola patients at a time. One room was taken up by the laboratory, which was moved closer to the patient to keep it separate from other samples, and 2 rooms were set aside for clean supplies and dirty supplies.

No patient with Ebola has been identified in Massachusetts, and the likelihood of it happening is considered remote, albeit possible. Logan Airport is not among the US airports designated for travelers arriving from West Africa. But every hospital has been investing in training and equipment to prepare for the possibility of an Ebola patient arriving, according to the Massachusetts Hospital Association. "At this time, all acute-care hospitals are ready to evaluate and determine treatment for patients exhibiting Ebola-like symptoms," a statement from the hospital association said.
