As temperatures rise, so do the numbers of _Vibrio vulnificus_ in brackish
or ocean waters. They grow there naturally. So far this year, two people in
Louisiana and Mississippi have died from this infection. A second Louisiana
man is recovering and another case is suspected.
People can get infected either by eating raw seafood or getting the
bacteria in a cut, blister or other wound. But most people can still enjoy
raw oysters and wading in the Gulf of Mexico, Dr. Charles Sanders, chairman
of the department of medicine at LSU Medical Center, and other doctors
emphasized. "We need to get away from this hysteria," Sanders said.
Karl Turner of the Louisiana Seafood Promotion Marketing Board figures that
since 1985, there has been less than one case per 25 million Louisiana
oysters eaten.
So far this year, two cases have been confirmed in Louisiana, and a
possible case is being investigated, said Dr. Tom Farley, an epidemiologist
in the state Office of Public Health. He said one of the confirmed cases
was fatal. But he would not comment on a report that the death was that of
U.S. District Judge Patrick E. Carr, 75.
The other was Adam Duhe, 74, of Reserve, who is finally getting out of
Memorial Medical Center in New Orleans after nearly three weeks in
hospitals, four operations on his left hand and arm, and plastic surgery.
Duhe said the suspected case is a friend of his. The other man's arm had to
be amputated last week, he said.
The case fatality rate is about 45 percent for people infected by eating
shellfish, about 25 percent for those infected through skin wounds.
Several years ago, Sanders said, an oyster shucker came to Charity
Hospital, his left arm red and swollen to the elbow. He'd slipped and
punctured his hand with an oyster knife 24 to 36 hours earlier. Taking off
the arm at the shoulder didn't save him as he was already systemically
infected.
Duhe, a diabetic [a known risk factor, see below. MHJ, thinks he probably
was pricked by a shrimp shell during a shrimping trip. He came down with
chills hours after the afternoon trip. The next morning, his arm was
swollen almost to the elbow, with blood blisters on his wrist.
Other symptoms can include huge red swellings, big blood blisters,
diarrhea, fever, chills, vomiting and shock.
Anyone who eats uncooked seafood or dips a nicked finger into seawater is
probably exposed to _Vibrio vulnificus_. It is claimed that in 1996, a
61-year-old Alabama woman died two days after a crab pinched her while she
was cleaning it for a gumbo dinner.
Most shrug it off. Our immune systems wipe out its invasion. Sanders said
he suspects but hasn't proven that stomach acid kills the germ in food. But
people whose stomach, liver or immune system is in poor shape don't have
that protection. That can include heavy drinkers who don't know they have
liver problems and people on chemotherapy. The U.S. Food and Drug
Administration also warns people taking antacids to avoid raw oysters.
About 30 to 50 cases are reported a year, most among people above the age
of 45, said Dr. George Pankey, an Ochsner Clinic consultant who described
the first Louisiana case in 1971. It's not a function of age itself. Older
people are more likely to have the medical problems that make anyone
susceptible to the bacterium, often without knowing it. For instance, after
a Gulfport man died in April, Mississippi health officials said he had a
liver problem. His family hadn't known of any [hepatic problem, though his
wife said he regularly drank alcoholic beverages. Pankey said he'd
recommend that anyone susceptible to the disease wear gloves to handle
shrimp or crabs, or when cleaning out the bottom of a boat.

ex USFDA, conditions which make _V. vulnificus_ infections dangerous:
- Liver disease
- Diabetes
- Stomach problems, including prior gastric surgery and hypoacidity from
antacid use.
- Cancer
- Immune disorders, including HIV infections
- Long-term steroid use for asthma or arthritis, and other immune
suppressant treatments
- Hemochromatosis
- The elderly, who are prone to the above conditions, sometimes without
obvious symptoms
