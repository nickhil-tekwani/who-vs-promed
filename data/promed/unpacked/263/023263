A 73-year-old patient, maintained for more than 2 months in the intensive care unit of the Joaquin Pablo Franco in Las Tablas, died on Wednesday afternoon [15 Aug 2018] after having been infected by bacteria acquired in the hospital.

This information was confirmed by the Los Santos provincial health authorities, who explained that the patient, from the Flores community in Tonosi in Los Santos Province, had suffered hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome but remained hospitalized.

Carlos Munoz, head of Epidemiology in the Los Santos health region, indicated that the patient died due to a bacterial infection and not specifically to [a] hantavirus [infection], since he had been taken off a ventilator; however, he presented with complications that caused his death.

According to Munoz, the death of the patient is associated with hantavirus [infection] but will not be considered within the statistics of deaths due to the disease, since his death was due to bacterial complications. "We could determine that the death of this patient was not from [a] hantavirus [infection]. The patients in the intensive care unit are very susceptible to these types of infections, and this is what happened with this man. It was a bacteria and fungus that he acquired in the course of his hospitalization," stated Munoz.

According to MINSA [Ministry of Health], the statistics of deaths from this disease in Los Santos remain as 3 this year [2018]: 2 from the Pocri district and one from the Tonosi district.

[The patient apparently had a severe case of a hantavirus infection requiring mechanical ventilation. A hantavirus infection was responsible for the patient's hospitalization but was not the immediate cause of death. It is not stated medically why he was hospitalized for 2 months or when he was taken off ventilation. The number of cases of hantavirus infection continues to increase in Los Santos province, with a total of 61 cases in the region as of Tue 14 Aug 2018. Hantavirus infections occur in Los Santos province relatively frequently. The specific situations in which these patients acquired the infection are not mentioned.

There is no indication of which hantavirus is involved in this or in previous cases in Panama. However, as noted in comments in previous posts, Los Santos and adjoining provinces are endemic for Choclo hantavirus. Although no data on this or the previous cases in earlier years include an indication of which hantavirus is responsible, Choclo is the only one of the 3 hantaviruses known to be endemic in Panama that causes HPS (hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome) or hantavirus fever. However, Dr. Jan Clemens recently commented that Seoul hantavirus could also be present in Panama causing human infections. Appropriate laboratory tests would be required to differentiate Choclo and Seoul viruses. No vaccine is available for Choclo virus.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents live in and around agricultural areas and adjacent houses and buildings. They can be persistently infected with the virus and shed it in urine, feces, and saliva, the source of human infections. - Mod.TY
