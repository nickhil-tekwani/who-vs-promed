Dead dog contains same toxin as sea slug sample
-----------------------------------------------
Tests done by the Cawthron Institute have confirmed that the toxin
found in the vomit of one of the dogs that died after visiting Narrow
Neck Beach was also found in a sea slug sample taken from that beach.

The toxin has been identified as tetrodotoxin, which is also found in
tropical puffer fish. How the sea slugs came to contain the toxin is
not known and investigations are continuing.

Monitoring of Auckland's east coast and Coromandel beaches yesterday
[13 Aug 2009] found evidence of dead sea slugs only at Narrow Neck
and Cheltenham beaches. This tends to suggest that the issue could be
localised.

Auckland Regional Council (ARC) will continue to monitor Auckland
beaches for sea slugs and will conduct tests on any samples for the toxin.

Reported deaths of pilchards, penguins and dolphins are still being
investigated.

The Hauraki Gulf is a national icon and marine park. ARC Chairman
Mike Lee reminded Aucklanders today [14 Aug 2009] that we must all be
constantly vigilant to maintain the health and vitality of this treasure.

Scientists sample beachfront for clues in dog deaths
----------------------------------------------------
Scientists from Nelson-based Cawthron Institute have spent the day
scouring Narrow Neck Beach for clues in the deaths of 2 dogs on
Auckland's waterfront.

Cawthron, a world-renowned algae authority, has been working with
local agencies testing samples from the area, and believes it is
likely the deaths have been caused by a naturally occurring
neurotoxin within the beach environment.

Scientist Dr Susie Wood says because there are many neurotoxins that
can occur in marine and coastal environments, identifying the source
is critical in defining the potential culprit, and this is best done
in the environment where the problem is occurring.

Two Cawthron scientists today [7 Aug 2009] scanned the affected area,
collecting various samples including shellfish (which tend to collect
any existing toxins), and putting out bags (which sit in the water
accumulating toxins over time so if there are any in the water the
bags will absorb them).

If there is anything there, Dr Wood says they would expect to find it
pretty quickly, with the results of their site examination expected
by mid-to-late next week [week of 14 Aug 2009].

"Our experience in the freshwater environment shows how important it
is to begin researching early to determine exactly what is going on,
as the problem generally does not go away, it just tends to get worse
and worse."

Cawthron has already confirmed dog deaths from anatoxin, a neurotoxin
from freshwater algae, with a record number of river system
fatalities around the country last summer [2008-09] in Nelson,
Takaka, Wellington, and Canterbury in particular.

While there has never been a report of a dog dying from marine algae
before, Dr Wood says evidence to date strongly suggests this is the
most likely scenario with the freshwater cases displaying similar
symptoms to the recent dog deaths' including frothing at the mouth
and paralysis.

She says, dogs are particularly susceptible because, along with
neurotoxins, algae emit an odour, which while putrid to humans, is
particularly appealing to dogs, and given they like to eat rotten
smelly things, they are most likely to ingest it, which we know is often fatal.

Proving neurotoxin poisoning within the marine environment would be
significant internationally, Dr Wood says until now only birds, sea
lions, and other marine animals have been known to be killed in this way.

"If algae is the culprit it is likely it has only now made its
presence known, either as a new species arriving here, or some storm
event or strong wave action has detached this particular strain from
rocks washing it up onto the beach, where dogs are sniffing it out."

While the algae is unlikely to be harmful to humans, unless eaten,
Cawthron is supporting the district health board initiative to post
warning signs to keep the public safe.

Cawthron is a world-wide authority on algae. It maintains a
significant living collection of micro-algae, the only collection of
its kind in New Zealand, which is highly ranked in the Asia-Pacific
region. The collection includes several species unique to New Zealand.

Cawthron says there is nothing at this stage to link the dog deaths
to the penguin, pilchard, and dolphin fatalities.

Samples of toxic material are still required and material collected
prior to consumption by a dog, but known to have caused a dog to
become ill, would be very useful to our research. Samples can be sent
to Susie Wood at Cawthron Institute in Nelson.

[While the 2nd article is more research related, and was published on
7 Aug 2009, it has been included to provide other researchers method
of seeing what is done at the Cawthron Institute and foster some collaboration.

The 1st article is the most recent and has identified the toxin as
tetrodotoxin. This is generally associated with puffer fish.

How the toxin arrived in the sea slugs is quite mysterious. Dogs on
the other hand will consume the sea slugs on the shore (that's a
tongue twister) and acquire the same toxin.

Tetrodotoxin, a very potent toxin, selectively blocks the
voltage-sensitive sodium channels of excitable tissues and neuronal
transmission in skeletal muscles. In humans, paresthesias begin 10-45
minutes after ingestion, usually as tingling of the tongue and inner
surface of the mouth. Other common symptoms include vomiting,
lightheadedness, dizziness, feelings of doom, and weakness. Paralysis
spreads, and death can occur within 6-24 hours, often due to
paralysis of the muscles of respiration. Other signs include
salivation, muscle twitching, diaphoresis, pleuritic chest pain,
dysphagia, aphonia, and convulsions. Severe poisoning is indicated by
hypotension, bradycardia, depressed corneal reflexes, and fixed
dilated pupils. There is no specific antidote and treatment is often
supportive.

It is likely that dogs react to tetrodotoxin in approximately the
same mechanism as humans do. Consequently, they are not likely to
have an easy death.

There are a number of different species of puffer fish or blow fish,
each of which produces a different concentration of the toxin. - Mod.TG]
