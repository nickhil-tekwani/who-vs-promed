An outbreak of a disease that can spread from parrots to humans has
resulted in quarantines at 2 Northern California pet stores.
The Marin Humane Society reported 71 birds at San Rafael's Petco
store have been placed under a 45-day quarantine following exposure to
a potentially fatal disease commonly known as "parrot fever." Also,
about 20 birds at the Davis Petco have been quarantined as a
precaution, after 1 bird and its owner became ill. Both have
recovered.
Humane society spokesman John Reese said the birds have been exposed
to psittacosis, a disease that can easily be spread from bird to bird.
Birds most commonly affected by "parrot fever" are parrots, parakeets,
lovebirds and cockatiels. However, any bird can become infected, he
said.
"The disease can be effectively treated, and we are contacting people
who purchased birds during the past 2 months to inform them of the
situation," Animal Services director Cindy Machado said.
Signs of psittacosis, which vary from bird to bird, include nasal
discharge, red eyes, depression and loss of appetite, difficulty
breathing, diarrhea and sudden death.
Reese said the disease can be passed to humans, but the risk is low.
The elderly and people with compromised immune systems are at an
increased risk. Symptoms include fever, headache, chills and
respiratory diseases.
