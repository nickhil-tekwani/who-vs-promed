A Quarter Horse stallion residing at a small private farm in Frederick County, Virginia has tested positive for equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM), the neurologic form of equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1).

"The horse had not been off the farm in several months," the Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported on 23 Sep 2018. "There was no exposure to horses outside of the farm. The farm is under quarantine, and temperatures of the resident horses are being monitored twice a day. Any horses that display clinical signs will be reported to the State Veterinarian and will be tested."

The Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported on 22 Sep 2018 that animal health officials have confirmed a case of equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM), the neurological form of equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1), in a Montgomery County, Maryland horse.

"On 21 Sep 2018, the Maryland Department of Agriculture Animal Health Program confirmed a positive EHM case in a 12-year-old Warmblood gelding," the EDCC said. "The neurological horse was seen earlier and treated as an outpatient on 21 Sep 2018 at a private veterinary clinic Loudoun County, Virginia before returning home to a private farm in Montgomery County, Maryland. A hold order was placed on the farm the evening of 21 Sep 2018.

"There are 18 horses on the farm in 3 barns," the EDCC continued. "The positive gelding is isolated from all horses on the farm. The positive gelding was previously housed with 4 horses in one barn. The other 2 barns are more than 30 feet away from the exposed barn. Strict isolation and biosecurity protocols are in place at the exposed barn with body temperatures taken twice daily."

No equine movement is permitted on or off the farm, regardless of which barn the horses are stabled in, the EDCC said.

"The attending veterinarians that administers to this farm will be notified of the hold order and apprised of the procedures taken to control the spread of EHV-1/EHM," the EDCC said. "Possible links to the positive gelding are actively being investigated."

Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and EHM (the neurologic form). In many horses, the 1st or only sign of EHV-1 infection is fever, which can go undetected.

In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation, around 8 months, but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with the neurologic form usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore- and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

Herpesvirus is easily spread by nose-to-nose or close contact with an infectious horse; sharing contaminated equipment including bits, buckets, and towels; or clothing, hands, or equipment of people who have recently had contact with an infectious horse. Routine biosecurity measures, including hygiene and basic cleaning and disinfection practices, should be in place at all times to help present disease spread.

Current EHV-1 vaccines might reduce viral shedding but are not protective against the neurologic form of the disease. Implementing routine biosecurity practices is the best way to minimize viral spread, and the best method of disease control is disease prevention.

["Equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM) is another name for the neurologic disease associated with equine herpesvirus (EHV) infections. Neurological signs appear as a result of damage to blood vessels in the brain and spinal cord associated with EHV infection. Interference with the blood supply leads to tissue damage and a subsequent loss in normal function of areas in the brain and spinal cord.

To date, 9 EHVs have been identified world-wide. Three of these -- EHV-1, EHV-3, and EHV-4 -- pose the most serious health risks for domesticated horses and can have significant economic impacts on the U.S. equine industry.

- EHV-1:
Can cause four manifestations of disease in horses, including a neurological form, respiratory disease, abortion, and neonatal death. EHM is most often due to mutant or neuropathogenic strains of EHV-1, so called because of a particular mutation in the genome.

- EHV-3:
Causes a venereal disease called equine coital exanthema that affects the external genitalia.

- EHV-4:
Causes a nonfatal upper respiratory tract disease in foals and is uncommonly associated with abortion and rarely with neurologic disease.

Neurological signs appear as a result of damage to blood vessels in the brain and spinal cord associated with EHV infection.

How common are EHV-1 infections?
By 2 years of age, almost all horses have been infected with EHV-1. The initial exposure generally occurs in foals from contact with their dams. The virus can then become latent, or inactive, in the horse's body, setting up a carrier state that is life-long. Horses of any age that are carriers of EHV-1 do not show any external signs of disease when the virus is in a latent form. The virus can be reactivated during times of stress, such as strenuous exercise, long-distance transport, or at weaning.

EHV-1 is the primary cause of EHM. In recent years, there has been a marked increase in the number of EHV-1 cases, especially EHM, reported in the United States. There have also been several outbreaks of EHM at large horse facilities and events--at racetracks, horse show grounds, veterinary clinics, and boarding stables. The large number of horses that can be exposed on such premises and the serious nature of the disease have caused significant concern within the animal health community and the U.S. horse industry. Furthermore, these recent occurrences of EHM appear to meet the criteria of an emerging disease. A disease is considered to be "emerging" when it satisfies at least one of three criteria:
1. The disease is identified for the first time in a region or country;
2. A disease changes in severity, type of animal that can be infected, or other changes in pathogen behavior; or
3. There is a change in geographic range of a disease or in its incidence within a range.

EHM likely meets the 2nd criterion of an emerging disease, as the recent EHV-1 outbreaks seem to be associated with a change in the severity and behavior of the virus. It is possible that the reporting of EHV-1 cases has increased, rather than an actual increase in the number and severity of cases; however, more data are needed to make such a distinction. The virus can be reactivated during times of stress, such as strenuous exercise, long-distance transport, or at weaning.

How the virus spreads
The most common way for EHV-1 to spread is by direct horse-to-horse contact. This virus is shed from infected horses via the respiratory tract or through direct or indirect contact with an infected aborted fetus and fetal membranes. Horses may appear to be perfectly healthy yet spread the virus via the secretions from their nostrils. It is important to realize that EHV-1 can also be spread indirectly through contact with physical objects contaminated with infectious virus.

Examples of such objects include:
- Tack,
- Wipe rags or other grooming equipment,
- Feed and water buckets, and
- People's hands or clothing.

The air around a horse that is shedding the virus can also be contaminated with infectious virus. Although we know that the virus can become airborne, it is difficult to establish the distance the virus can spread in this manner under typical horse management and environmental conditions.

Is there a treatment for EHM?
The standard form of care for EHM is primarily supportive. Treatments may include intravenous fluids or anti-inflammatory drugs. Antibiotics may be used to treat a secondary bacterial infection if one develops; however, antibiotics have no effect on the equine herpesvirus itself. Antiviral drugs have also been used to treat EHM cases. Research on the efficacy of these drugs, their cost effectiveness, and the optimal dosing regimen for EHM is still underway.

How can I prevent EHV-1, the primary cause of EHM, from spreading to other horses?
There are many steps you can take to help prevent the spread of EHV-1.
- Stop horse movement if your animals may be infected with EHV-1. This is the most important first step horse owners can take. Horses should neither enter nor leave a premise where EHM has been diagnosed until cleared by the veterinarian.
- Do not allow horses exposed to EHM case(s) to have contact with unexposed horses on the premises.
- Isolate sick horses. Horses that have aborted or shown signs of fever, respiratory disease, or neurologic disease should be separated from healthy horses. Ideally, the sick horse(s) should be moved into a separate building or paddock on the premises or be transported to a veterinary hospital with an isolation facility.
- Do not share equipment among horses on the facility. Since this virus can be spread from horse to horse via contaminated objects such as water/feed buckets or bridles, equipment should not be shared among horses.
- Practice proper biosecurity measures to prevent people from spreading the virus. Since people can transfer this virus from horse to horse via their hands and clothing, personnel should wash their hands after handling one horse and before handling another. They should also change their clothes and footwear after working with a sick horse. Optimally, a person who takes care of a sick horse should not work with healthy horses. When this is not practical, healthy horses should be handled first and sick horses last. Wearing gloves and using disinfectant to sanitize footwear can also help minimize the risk of people spreading the virus between animals.

Can I prevent EHM with vaccines?
Vaccines exist to control the respiratory and abortion manifestations of EHV-1; however, the currently licensed vaccines are not labeled for the prevention of EHM. University and private researchers are looking into several existing vaccines to determine if they protect against EHM. New vaccines for EHM are also being studied."

The above information from USDA mirrors the number of increasing cases posted to ProMED-mail. As this article points out, is it a true increase in cases or an increase in reporting? Has increased awareness of clinical signs resulted in an increase in reporting? Likely, only time will completely answer these questions. - Mod.TG
