PARASITIC PROTOZOA STUDY RFI
============================
Dear Colleages,
We are working on the evolution and diagnostic of parasitic protozoa
from the phylum Apicomplexa. This group of protozoa includes several
species of medical and veterinary relevance, among them, the agents of
malaria and several opportunistic infections in humans. We are specifically
interested in Haemosporina (for a systematic study) and Coccidia from the
genus Cryptosporidium (for a reservoir study). Some of them are common
parasite of birds and primates (for examples genus Plasmodium, Homoproteus,
Leucocytozoon, Hepatocystis, and Hepatozoon). These parasites are considered
an important health problem for wildlife, as has been the case of bird
malaria in Hawaii. We also have found interesting data from malaria in
primates including Gorillas and Chimpanzees, and from parasites belong the
genus Cryptosporidium in several vertebrates.
I am interested in contacting veterinary-wildlife researchers working
on vertebrates, and/or parasites to explore common interests and perhaps a
further collaboration. I will appreciate that you distribute this message
among your colleagues.

I will be glad to get any suggestion that you may have. I belive that
this kind of interaction can improve our knowledge of the host-parasite
interaction and its clinical implications in the vertebrate host. Thanks in
advance,

Sincerely yours,
Ananias Escalante, PhD
