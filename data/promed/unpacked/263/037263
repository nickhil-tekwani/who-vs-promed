Two children from a Teesdale nursery have been taken to hospital after contracting _E. coli_. Experts are currently investigating a total of 4 cases at Kirklands Day Nursery, in Barnard Castle, as 2 other children are being cared for at home. A spokeswoman for Public Health England also confirmed a 5th child with recent symptoms is awaiting test results. The children fell ill at about the same time between 25 and 27 Apr 2015.

The nursery, in Bede Road, has been closed while the organization, along with Durham County Council, investigates the cause of the infection. The spokeswoman said: "Experts from Public Health England and Durham County Council can confirm they are investigating 4 cases of _E. coli_ O157 infection in children who attend Kirklands Day Nursery in Barnard Castle.

Dr Deb Wilson, a consultant at PHE's North-East center, said: "_E. coli_ O157 is a relatively rare infection which can cause a range of symptoms from mild diarrhea to severe abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea. A very small proportion of patients, mainly children, can develop a serious complication that can lead to kidney failure. The source of the infection in these children is not yet known, and the investigation is continuing. As a precaution, the nursery has temporarily closed while all the necessary public health measures are put in place to prevent any further spread of infection."

All children and staff are now being asked to submit 2 stool samples, taken at least 24 hours apart, for testing as part of further control measures and will be allowed to return to the nursery when they have had 2 negative results.

GPs and other healthcare providers in the area have also been contacted and asked to be on the lookout for any further possible cases.

The nursery's owner, Janice Duffy-McGhie, said a "thorough and intensive clean" had taken place at the nursery.

[Outbreaks of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ are not uncommon in day care centers, as, especially with young children, there is ample opportunity for child-to-child transmission related to less than ideal hygiene. Toddlers are marvelous sharers of toys as well as fecally contaminated hands. - Mod.LL
