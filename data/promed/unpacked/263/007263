Anthrax has been confirmed in 2 patients in Southern Kazakhstan who have
been hospitalized previously on suspicion of this disease. The
press-service of the Ministry of Extreme Situations of the republic reports
that other patients are under supervision.
Nine persons have been hospitalized with suspicion of anthrax in the
Infectious Department of the Saryagashskoj District hospital in Southern
Kazakhstan, 2 with typical symptoms of cutaneous anthrax.
Zhmaguk Madetov, the deputy director of Department of Sanitary-Epidemic
Control in Southern Kazakhstan, reported that patients with suspected
anthrax have been admitted to hospital in the last few days from 3
different settlements in Saryagashskiy district. Anthrax has been confirmed
in 2 of 9 persons hospitalized.
Medetov stated that all the patients had taken part in the slaughter and
butchering of sick animals. The 1st instance was in the settlement of
Inkes, where 5 people killed 2 sick cows. The 2nd was in Beshkuduk, near
Sargyagash, where 3 people killed 2 sick cows. The 3rd was in Saryshagan,
where the owner killed a 6-month-old calf. In all instances the meat was
distributed among relatives. The recovered pieces of meat were burned by
the investigating epidemiologists.
"Now, households have been checked; everyone who was in contact with the
meat is under medical supervision, and all of them have received a
preventive 5-day course of antibiotics, " said Medetov.
More than 300 natural foci of anthrax exist in Southern Kazakhstan. Some
3-4 years ago about 20 cases of anthrax were registered annually in the region.
The public is being widely informed; the health officers reported in which
districts the disease had been reported and which animals had been killed;
also spot-checks on the city markets were carried out; and the population
was warned to take care when purchasing meat.
After a change of regional management and of sanitary epidemiological
supervision 3 years ago, cases of anthrax in the region have [had?]
disappeared. Occasionally there have been suspicions of anthrax, but the
Sanitary - Epidemic Service and Public Health Services refuted them and
suspect cases have not been confirmed.

[Anthrax in this region of Kazakhstan is registered frequently. In the last
year alone a preliminary diagnosis of anthrax was reported in 4 inhabitants
of Southern Kazakhstan. However, results of the final investigation have
not been disclosed - Mod.NP]
[This report has been referred back to Almaty for comments on the absence
of confirmatory reports. Checking our recent postings does reveal that
confirmations seem to be missing. - Mod.MHJ]
