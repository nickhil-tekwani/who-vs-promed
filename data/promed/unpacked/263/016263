Indonesia: 69th Human Case of H5N1 Avian Influenza
---------------------------------------------------
An Indonesian woman hospitalised in East Java has
tested positive for avian influenza virus
infection, a hospital official said on Fri 28 Sep
2006, bringing the total number of cases in the
world's worst-hit country to 69. The woman, 21,
is the elder sister of an 11-year-old boy who
died on 18 Sep 2006 after being infected with the
H5N1 virus, but human-to-human transmission is
unlikely as both came into contact with infected poultry.
"The results came out this morning. She is still
alive despite having had direct contact with
infected chickens," said Urip Murtejo, a
spokesman for Sutomo Hospital in Surabaya, where
the woman has been treated since Monday. "She has
to use a ventilator to help her breathe," he told
AFP. Test results from two laboratories at the
Health Ministry in Jakarta showed that she had
contracted the H5N1 virus, Murtejo said.
Positive results from 2 Indonesian laboratories
mean that the World Health Organization (WHO)
includes the case in its records. According to
the WHO, poultry began dying in the family's
household in the month before the boy's symptoms
appeared and poultry deaths continued later in their neighbourhood.
Murtejo said he did not know whether scientists
were investigating the possibility of
human-to-human transmission and officials from
the health ministry were unavailable for comment.
Typically such investigations are carried out
only if a victim is believed to have had no
contact with infected poultry. So-called cluster
cases, where the H5N1 virus is spread from human
to human rather than from poultry -- the usual
method of transmission -- increase the chance of
the virus mutating to become easily transmissible
between people. Scientists are concerned that
such a development could lead to a global
pandemic with a potential death toll of millions.
Indonesia is grappling with ongoing outbreaks of
the H5N1 virus in its poultry and has reported 52 deaths among its 69 cases.
