At one year after a toxic spill, Spanish scientists denounce the effects on
birds
One year after a toxic spill that caused damage in the south of Spain,
scientists reported that the birds from a local nature reserve had been
drinking from contaminated waters.
The Superior Council of Scientific Investigation reported today
[4 May 1999 that approximately 11% of the 250 000 birds in the
National Park of Danana probably suffered from some illness
due to the spill.
The spill occurred 25 April [1998 when a deposit of liquid waste from a
zinc mine broke, carrying some 5000 million liters of waste to the
Guadiamar river.
Repair teams rapidly erected dikes to prevent the contamination arriving
at the National Park of Donana, a reserve of 75 000 hectars for migratory
birds that protects endangered species.
>From October [1998 to February [1999 the CSIC took blood samples
from the birds in the affected zones and determined that they had
abnormal concentrations of lead. 70% of the lead comes from the
spill and the rest from the ingestion of hunter's shotgun pellets,said
the CSIC.
In comparison with the natural disaster of 1986, when thousands of birds
died from botulism, this is worse because it could have long term effects,
said the director of the center of investigations of the Donana Park,
Miguel Ferrer.
"It is the worst disaster that has occurred to Donana [the reserve", said
Ferrer when he presented the report of CSIC yesterday.
According to the report, 22% of the geese, the major species in Donana,
have lethal concentrations of lead. It shows that this can affect the lynxes
and eagles that feed on the geese.
He also said that other birds such as ducks, 'negretas' and 'ciguenas'
also had high levels of the metals in their blood, although not lethal.
Ferrer recommended in depth cleaning out of the whole zone.
On the 24 March 1999 the parent company of the mine, Boliden Ltd, of
Swedish-Canadian ownership, received permission to reopen the installation
in spite of still being under judicial investigation about the disaster.
