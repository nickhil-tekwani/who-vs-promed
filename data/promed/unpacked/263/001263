Laboratory-Acquired West Nile Virus Infections --- United States, 2002
---------------------------------------------------
West Nile virus (WNV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus introduced recently to
North America, is a human, equine, and avian neuropathogen (1). The
majority of human infections with WNV are mosquito-borne; however,
laboratory-acquired infections with WNV and other arboviruses also occur
(2, 3, 4). This report summarizes 2 recent cases of WNV infection in
laboratory workers without other known risk factors who acquired infection
through percutaneous inoculation. Laboratory workers handling fluids or
tissues known or suspected to be WNV-infected should minimize their risk
for exposure and should report injuries and illnesses of suspected
occupational origin to their supervisor.
Case Reports:
Case 1. In Aug 2002, a microbiologist working in a U.S. laboratory was
performing a necropsy on a blue jay submitted as part of a state's WNV
surveillance program. The microbiologist worked in a Class II laminar flow
biosafety cabinet under biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) conditions (5) and
lacerated a thumb while using a scalpel to remove the bird's brain. The
wound, a superficial cut over the dorsal surface of the interphalangeal
joint, was cleansed and bandaged. 4 days after injury, the microbiologist
had acute symptoms of headache, myalgias, and malaise followed by chills,
sweats, dysesthesias, recurring hot flashes, swelling of the post-auricular
lymph nodes, and anorexia. 2 days later, the microbiologist noted a
maculopapular rash that began on the face; extended to the trunk, arms, and
legs during the next 3 days; and then disappeared gradually. The
microbiologist continued to work during illness and had intermittent
chills, sweats, dysesthesias, and hot flashes for approximately 1 week
before recovering fully. On the third day of illness (7 days post-injury),
the microbiologist sought medical care from a physician and reported no
history of recent mosquito bites, prolonged outdoor activities, or recent
blood transfusion. On physical examination, the patient was afebrile with
erythema on the cheeks, but the examination was otherwise normal. Serial
serum samples taken from the patient and submitted to CDC for WNV serologic
testing revealed evidence of an acute WNV infection. The initial specimen
(collected 3 days after illness onset) was negative for WNV-specific IgM or
neutralizing antibodies. Specimens collected 13 and 21 days after illness
onset both were positive for WNV-specific IgM antibody; the latter specimen
was positive for WNV-specific neutralizing antibody, with a titer of 160;
the specimen collected 13 days after illness onset was not tested by
neutralization. The brain of the blue jay tested positive at CDC for WNV
RNA by real-time polymerase chain reaction (TaqMaq) using 2 primer/probe sets.
Case 2. In Oct 2002, a microbiologist working in a U.S. laboratory who was
harvesting WNV-infected mouse brains in a Class II laminar flow biosafety
cabinet under BSL-3 conditions (5) punctured a finger with a contaminated
needle. The wound was cleansed and bandaged. The microbiologist's body
temperature was measured several times each day, and 3 days after injury,
the microbiologist had upper respiratory infection (URI) symptoms without
fever or chills. The next day, URI symptoms continued with malaise,
fatigue, chills, and a low-grade fever (100.9 F [38.3 C]). That evening,
the patient took an over-the-counter cold medication. The next morning, the
patient awoke without fever or chills but with continued URI symptoms and a
dry cough and hoarseness that persisted for >1 week, although the patient
missed only 1 day of work. At no time did the patient notice a skin rash,
an increase in the usual degree of joint pain, or a stiff neck. The patient
reported no history of recent mosquito bites, prolonged outdoor activities,
or recent blood transfusion. The patient had a history of exposure to
multiple flaviviruses or flavivirus antigens (i.e., had had dengue fever
and had received yellow fever and Japanese encephalitis vaccines). Serial
serum samples taken and submitted to CDC for WNV serologic testing revealed
evidence of an acute WNV infection. WNV-specific IgM antibody was absent
from both the initial specimens (1 day after injury and 3 days before fever
onset) and a specimen collected 2 days after fever onset. Anti-flaviviral
IgG antibody was detected in both of these specimens by enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA), but no change in the intensity of IgG activity
was observed. A serum specimen collected 10 days after illness onset was
positive for WNV-specific IgM antibody and showed a sharp increase in the
intensity of anti-flaviviral IgG antibody by ELISA. Neutralizing antibody
test results are pending.
MMWR Editorial Note:
This report documents 2 recent laboratory-acquired WNV infections in the
United States. On the basis of the timing of the events described, WNV
infection of the 2 microbiologists resulted from exposure through
percutaneous inoculation in laboratories. Illnesses in both laboratory
workers were mild and self-limited, which is typical of illnesses in
WNV-infected persons (1). These cases confirm that laboratory workers are
at risk for occupationally acquired WNV infection (2, 3, 4), including West
Nile meningoencephalitis.
In the second case, although the presence of heterologous flavivirus
antibodies did not prevent WNV infection, these heterologous antibodies
might have provided some degree of cross-protection that moderated the
clinical severity of the infection. Laboratory workers should not assume
that immunity to other flaviviruses will protect them from WNV infection or
its more severe clinical consequences (6).
During the 2002 WNV epidemic and epizootic in the United States (7), the
number of laboratories and laboratory workers involved in arboviral
diagnostic and reference activities has increased substantially. Therefore,
the potential for laboratory-acquired WNV infections has increased.
Laboratory-acquired arboviral infections are most likely underreported, and
few recent data are available (3,4). In 2001, a suspected case of
laboratory-acquired WNV infection was reported in New York (8). Laboratory
workers involved in necropsies or other procedures involving materials
potentially infected with WNV should use every precaution to minimize their
risk for exposure to fluids or tissues during handling, including standard
droplet and contact precautions; using and disposing of needles, scalpels,
and other sharp instruments safely; and minimizing the generation of aerosols.
The Subcommittee on Arbovirus Laboratory Safety of the American Committee
on Arthropod-Borne Viruses recommends four biosafety levels for
laboratories that handle arboviruses, comprising combinations of laboratory
practices and techniques, safety equipment, and laboratory facilities (2).
Laboratory investigations that involve handling of live WNV should be
conducted under BSL-3 containment (2,9). However, because of concerns that
strict BSL-3 containment for handling human or animal specimens in the
clinical diagnostic setting would severely limit the number of laboratories
capable of detecting WNV infections in a timely manner, BSL-2 facilities
can, with modest modification of their procedures, achieve an acceptable
level of safety for the conduct of certain routine diagnostic procedures
involving live WNV, including bird necropsies (9,10).
Participating laboratory employees should receive training that reinforces
awareness of potential occupational hazards and risks and that stresses the
importance of timely reporting of all injuries and illnesses of suspected
occupational origin. After unintentional laboratory incidents of potential
exposure to WNV-infected materials, an exposed person should cleanse any
wound or exposed skin immediately and thoroughly, receive first aid, and
then report the incident to a supervisor, as was done in the 2 cases
described in this report. No antivirals or other drugs are known to be
effective in the prevention or treatment of WNV infection. A baseline serum
specimen should be obtained and stored. If the worker has an illness within
the 2 weeks after the exposure, prompt medical evaluation, consultation
with public health authorities, and collection of additional serum samples
for virologic and serologic analysis are recommended.
CDC encourages the reporting of all laboratory-acquired arboviral
infections to local, state, and federal public health authorities,
regardless of clinical manifestations.

2002 - USA (34), which was a report from the Las Vegas Sun entitled "30 000
Pints of Plasma Quarantined". - Mod.CP]

A Comment on Plasma Supply
--------------------------
Is it not now high time to accept the higher cost and do as the U.S.
military does with blood -- freezing the precious units that pass the
multiple screenings so we will have 10-year storage times for recruited
units? Short-term cost savings from continuing liquid-blood storage in the
increasingly-harrowing screening environment are going to deepen the
shortages, possibly costing lives, when a mechanism to store blood
long-term exists and is well-tested.

Update: 9 Confirmed West Nile Virus fatalities Among 30 Raptors Examined
-------------------------------------------------
The University of Minnesota's Raptor Center had reported increasing numbers
of raptors picked up sick or dead earlier this fall, and thought to be
infected with West Nile virus (WNV). Dr. Emi Kate Saito, WNV Surveillance
Coordinator with the National Wildlife Health Service updated this
information as of 18 Dec 2002: "The National Wildlife Health Center (NWHC)
has tested some of the raptor cases admitted to raptor rehabilitation
centers. These cases underwent full diagnostic evaluation to determine
whether the deaths were due to WNV or to other causes. The NWHC WNV testing
protocol consists of isolating virus from organ tissues (such as kidneys,
spleen, brain, etc.) and then performing RT-PCR on the virus isolates to
confirm WNV. Other tests include looking for other infectious causes
(bacterial, fungal or other viral) and toxin exposure. As of 18 Dec 2002,
the NWHC had received 73 raptor carcasses from several states. Diagnostic
evaluation has been completed for 30 cases: 9 died due to WNV, 6 were
infected with WNV but did not show any or sufficient brain damage to
explain symptoms, 4 were WNV-negative but had sufficient brain damage
suggestive of viral encephalitis, and 11 died from other causes. In sum,
NWHC has diagnosed 9 confirmed and 10 possible cases of WNV. Further
confirmatory testing is planned for the 10 possible cases."
