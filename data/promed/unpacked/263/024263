Please refer to HMG-Nepal, Ministry of Health Press Release in the
Kathmandu Post of 09 June 1998 regarding occurrence of diaorrhea and other
communicable diseases during the last 3-4 months.

Outbreaks of gastro-enteritis, dysentery, typhoid fever, ARI, [acute
respiratory illness bronchopneumonia and others have been reported during
the last few months (approximately 17 out of the 75 districts in the
country have reported outbreaks).

So far, cholera was identified in one case from Dhanusha district
(confirmed by laboratory) while doctors attending patients reported other
cases cholera-like based on the characteristics of the stools. Generally
speaking, >99% of the diagnosis are clinical.

Outbreaks are expected during this time of the year, although an unusual
number occurred this year maybe due to heavy "spring" rains which have
resulted in contamination of sources of drinking water.

Most of the outbreaks are reported under control and no additional
assistance has been requested by the government.

Also, the increased number of cases/outbreaks, may be due to a better
reporting system. The Department of Health Services, through
the Epidemiology Division, publishes a weekly EWARS (Early
Warning Reporting System) Bulletin which I believe is available upon
request (it is not on the Internet).
