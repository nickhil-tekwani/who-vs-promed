Citrus leprosy detected in Belize
---------------------------------
It has been affecting other Central American countries, and for the
1st time citrus leprosis has been detected in Belize. The 1st report
[from Stann Creek District, south east region] came in early August
[2011] when a farmer noticed that his fruits appeared to be rotting.
The Citrus Grower's Association (CGA) suspected citrus leprosis and it
was later confirmed in lab tests. According to Henry Anderson, CGA,
since then the disease has been confirmed in pockets on other farms,
BAHA [Belize Agricultural Health Authority] is now working with
growers to contain the spread.

Henry Anderson, CGA, said: "Samples were sent to the University of
Delvalle, Guatemala, to get laboratory confirmation that it was citrus
leprosis. It could be many different ways how it got here but we have
confirmed that it is here now. In the case of our industry where we
process the fruit, the fruit will drop before it is mature enough to
process."

Anderson notes that the disease is manageable and with containment
efforts, the losses can be minimized.

[Citrus leprosis is a devastating disease caused by _Citrus leprosis
virus_ (CiLV; not assigned to a genus, family _Rhabdoviridae_) So far,
it has only been reported from the Americas where it appears to be
spreading, and it has been placed on the A1 quarantine list of the
European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO). Symptoms may include
lesions on fruits, leaves and twigs, premature leaf and fruit drop,
defoliation, severe necrosis of new shoots, dieback of branches, bark
scaling, and reduction of the canopy leading to serious tree decline
and significant yield losses. CiLV only affects _Citrus_ species, and
primarily sweet orange varieties (_C. sinensis_) are susceptible.
Other species and hybrids have variable levels of resistance and some
may not show symptoms serving as latent virus reservoirs.

Two forms of CiLV exist, one occurring in the cytoplasm, the other in
the nucleus of infected host cells. Cytoplasmic CiLV (CiLV-C) has been
shown to be the prevalent type in orchards. Both types are spread by
the flat mite (or false spider mite, _Brevipalpus phoenicis_) and
other related mite species. Unlike many other plant viruses, CiLV does
not become systemic, which means each lesion represents a feeding
puncture of an infected vector. Infectious mites may be spread with
plant material such as budwood or rooted plantlets, and the leprosis
risk is particularly high for areas where vector species are already
present.

Disease management may include cultural methods to reduce virus and
vector reservoirs, but mainly relies on controlling the mites. Most
currently available miticides are effective and are applied once the
vector reaches economic thresholds. Biological control by mite
predators is being used occasionally. Disease levels often increase
when crop prices fall due to farmers saving costs by reducing
chemicals. Crop varieties with increased levels of resistance are
available, but none of the commercial sweet orange varieties are
resistant to leprosis.
