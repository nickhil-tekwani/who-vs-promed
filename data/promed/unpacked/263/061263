Researchers from the Indian Institute of Toxicology Research (IITR) have detected the presence of a toxin -- zearalenone -- in 84% of the cereals tested in Uttar Pradesh. The toxin, which is produced by soil fungi, behaves like an endocrine disruptor in humans, meaning this fungus can possibly lead to hormonal imbalances, birth defects, and other developmental disorders. Various studies have also indicated signs of early puberty in girls on exposure to a high intake of this toxin.

The findings of this research, published in the Journal of Food Science [Ref. 1], present a quantitative assessment of zearalenone contamination in cereals based on their daily consumption values. The experiment was carried out on 117 unbranded samples of corn, wheat, rice, and oats in Uttar Pradesh. After analysing the average cereal consumed, the daily intake of zearalenone in rice was found to be 17 times higher than the prescribed limit by the European Food Safety Authority Standards (EFSA). In the case of wheat samples, the daily intake of zearalenone was 8 times higher than EFSA limits.

In India, regulatory mechanisms are in place to control the contamination of fungal toxins that have previously led to disease outbreaks in humans and animals, including aflatoxins, which affects nuts, and deoxynivalenol and ergot, which infest cereal grains. Last year, 56 cows were found dead after grazing on post-harvest cuttings of maize later found to be contaminated by aflatoxins in the Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh.

India's warm and humid tropical climate inherently provides favourable conditions for mould infection to develop in food crops. Hot weather also complements the nature of zearalenone, which can endure very high temperatures. Zearalenone starts to accumulate as storage protein in the cereal grains during the storing, milling, and other high-temperature processing.

The important fact to note about zearalenone is that the spores of this fungus are permeating, which makes all cereal grain vulnerable to invasion and infestation. Geographical factors and environmental conditions such as erratic rain and high moisture makes fungal infection thrive in standing crops as well as in harvested food grains stored in warehouses.

"In the absence of any regulatory limits, the Indian population is at a greater risk of zearalenone exposure by consuming highly contaminated cereals," says Mukul Das, a senior toxicologist who designed the study. When asked about the presence of zearalenone in food grain, consumers in a local market of Delhi said that they were now "simply apprehensive about the food they are consuming."

While the research was conducted on cereal samples in Uttar Pradesh, the presence of this toxic fungus has indicated a potential risk for the Indian population. However, there is a need for further examination and quantitative analysis at the national level.

Considering about 80% of the Indian population consumes wheat and rice as their staple food, the exposure risk assessment of zearalenone serves as an important revelation for ensuring food safety. This also calls for immediate regulatory framework by the FSSAI to prescribe limits for zearalenone.

[Zearalenone is a nonsteroidal estrogenic mycotoxin produced by numerous _Fusarium_ molds -- including _F. graminearum_ (_Gibberella zeae_), _F. culmorum_, _F. verticilliodes_, _F. avenaceum_, _F. tricinctum_, _F. oxysporum_, and _F. nivale_ -- that can contaminate corn and grains and occasionally hays, straws, and silages.

Contamination of cereal grains by zearalenone has been reported worldwide, primarily in temperate climates. Typically, zearalenone concentrations are low in grain contaminated in the field but increase under storage conditions with moisture greater than 30-40%.

Zearalenone has major effects on reproduction in females (as evidenced by hyperestrogenism), but it affects the male reproductive system as well.

Zearalenone undergoes extensive enterohepatic circulation and biliary excretion in most species. The major route of excretion for most species is through the feces, although rabbits and humans primarily excrete zearalenone in the urine.

Concern has focused on potential residue of zearalenone and its metabolites in milk, eggs, and foods and precocious development of sexual characteristics in young female girls (Kuiper-Goodman et al., 1987; JECFA, 2000). Zearalenone and alpha- and beta-zearalenols can be transmitted into the milk of sheep, cows, and pigs administered high doses of zearalenone (Hagler et al., 1980; Mirocha et al., 1981). Hyperestrogenism has been reported in lambs and pigs nursing dams dosed with zearalenone (Hagler et al., 1980; Palyusik et al., 1980). Research indicates that minimal transmission of zearalanone occurs into milk and only for a short period of time after exposure to high concentrations of zearalenone.

Realizing that animals consuming this contaminated cereal grain can also pass it through the milk may mean that some of these individuals are getting it not only from the consumed cereal grains, but also from the milk. Zearalenone residues do not persist in animal tissues, although a small amount of the dose is excreted in milk. Thus, significant contamination of the food chain does not occur through consumption of animal products, with the possible exception of lipophilic metabolites present in egg yolk.

This mycotoxin is a serious food hazard as well as human health hazard. Warm and humid environmental conditions create a perfect environment for zearalenone to thrive, and monitoring its levels in grains over a recommended level may be important.

According to the USA National Grain and Feed Association report on allowable limits in food grains, for human and animals ranges from 1-4 ppm, dependent upon the use (animal or human feed) and the source (https://www.ngfa.org/wp-content/uploads/NGFAComplianceGuide-FDARegulatoryGuidanceforMycotoxins8-2011.pdf\).
