18 big hospitals in northeastern China have been using fake human
albumin, or plasma protein, to treat patients, state television
reported in the latest food and medicine scandal to hit the country.
In regular checks made by the food and drug administration in Jilin
province, 7 of 36 batches of the albumin, fed into the bloodstream by
drip, contained zero protein.
"There was no protein component," Xu Fei, deputy chief of the Jilin
food and drug inspection department, told China Central Television.
"It will not have the benefit it should have. We can say it is an
out-and-out fake product."
Experts said that use of the fake drip could put lives at risk for
those already seriously ill.
18 hospitals and 39 drug trading companies were found to be using the
fake human albumin, which led to huge profits because of its low
production cost.
Some of the hospitals called by Reuters were not immediately
available for comment.
Billions of dollars worth of counterfeit and substandard goods, from
fake liquor and medicines to luxury handbags, are produced every year in China.
In the most recent scandal, U.S. consumers were alarmed by a spate of
pet deaths blamed on tainted wheat gluten and rice protein exported
from China, as well as reports of toxins and disease in other Chinese exports.
A Chinese-made medicine ingredient also killed at least 100 people in
Panama, according to a report in the New York Times.
In one of the most highly publicized scandals, China revealed in 2004
that at least 13 babies had died from malnutrition in the eastern
province of Anhui after being fed fake baby formula.
Nearly 200 000 people die each year in China from improper use of
legitimate drugs, according to Jin Shiming, a committee member of the
Guangdong Provincial Science and Technological Association.

[The above newswire is yet another example of the problems associated
with the fake pharmaceutical market. While the above report details
the current "scandal" of fake albumin products produced and
distributed locally, there have been increasing numbers of incidents
reported in which these fake pharmaceutical products are exported
with concomitant associated morbidity and mortality in other
countries. In the 1st report on fake pharmaceuticals (see PRO/MBDS
posting Fake pharmaceuticals - Asia, Africa: RFI 20070220.0640),
there was a discussion on the impact of the international
distribution of anti-malarials that are substandard and are
contributing to the development of drug resistance in areas where
they are used and leading to increased morbidity and mortality among
the populations using these anti-malarials.
There has also been a problem associated with exporting diethylene
glycol in place of glycerin for use in pharmaceutical syrups, which
led to morbidity and mortality in Panama, and the addition of
melamine to pet food products, which led to morbidity and mortality
of pets in North America (see ProMED-mail references below).
There is a WHO sponsored initiative directed at combating counterfeit
pharmaceuticals. The website link for this activity is available at:
<http://www.wpro.who.int/health_topics/counterfeit_medicines/>,
with the implementation of a Rapid Alert System (RAS) for reporting
incidents of counterfeit pharmaceuticals
<http://www.counterfeitmedalert.info/default2.asp?tag=12>.
Jilin province is located in the northwestern portion of China,
bordering North Korea (For a map of China with provinces, see:
