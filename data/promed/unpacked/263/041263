UNDIAGNOSED FATAL ILLNESS - INDIA (07): (UTTAR PRADESH)

I am responding to the following query in "Undiagnosed fatal illness -
India (06): (UP) 20080830.2718": "The AES [acute encephalitis syndrome]
outbreak report does not indicate why this is not thought to be Japanese
encephalitis (JE). Is this a region where JE vaccine has been routinely
included in the children's vaccine series for years, and where that
coverage has been good, suggesting that most children should be protected?
ProMED-mail would appreciate information on that aspect."

In the last quarter of 2005, over 1500 children died in Eastern Uttar
Pradesh districts due to an outbreak of JE. A quick decision was made by
the Government of India to seek licensure of the live SA-14-14-2 (Chinese
origin) vaccine. In May and June 2006, 6.8 million children, one to 15
years were vaccinated in a highly successful campaign, covering more than
98 per cent of targeted children.

Vaccination was conducted only in the JE endemic districts in the eastern
region of Uttar Pradesh. Thereafter single dose JE vaccine has been
introduced in the National Immunisation Program in these districts and thus
JE vaccination has become "routine" in those districts.

This method of one campaign followed by routine vaccination has been
conducted in all JE endemic districts year by year, from 2006. This year
[2008] the campaigns will be in the southern most state of Kerala (limited
districts). This JE vaccination program is technically and financially
supported by PATH (Program for Appropriate Technology in Health
). You will be able to get full details from PATH (Dr Kathy
Neuzil is the nodal expert).

The Immunisation Program in Uttar Pradesh is weak and apparently the use of
JE vaccine in the routine system has not been very successful (from
conversations, no definitive data). However, local pediatricians have felt
substantial decline of JE from the 2006 JE season. It is for this reason
that the current "acute encephalitis syndrome" is not thought to be JE by
the government medical officers. In one of the reports a couple of weeks
ago there was mention that among over 100 children tested, only 5 had
evidence of JE virus infection. Testing for JE virus infection [by the]
health system in Uttar Pradesh leaves much to be desired from quality and
equity angles. Their annual non-polio "acute flaccid paralysis" rate is
above 7 per 100 000 children under tha age of 15, whereas the norm is 1/100
000 elsewhere. The Polio Eradication Initiative pegged up the norm for
Indian subcontinent to 2/100 000 -- but 7-10 per year remains unexplained.
So, Uttar Pradesh has low literacy, high density of population, high birth
rate, high infant mortality rate, poor vaccination coverage, high burden of
all sorts of infectious diseases, and weak health care and public health
systems. You may recall that Uttar Pradesh (along with neighboring Bihar)
is still endemic with wild types 1 and 3 polioviruses. "The wages of
neglect are death."
