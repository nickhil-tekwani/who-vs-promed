An outbreak of anthrax in livestock has been put under control in northeast China's Liaoning Province, said the provincial animal authorities on [Mon 27 Jul 2015]. 5 cattle and one mule died from the disease on [21 Jul 2015] in Xifeng County, Tieling city, said the Liaoning Provincial Bureau of Animal Health and Production.

An emergency response was immediately activated and 5 other cattle were killed, it added in a brief statement. The area was disinfected and the dead livestock were properly disposed of.

[Liaoning is not one of the Chinese provinces frequently reporting outbreaks of anthrax. ProMED-mail reported 10 human cases in 2012, as a result of exposure to slaughtered and butchered cattle. OIE reported 3 bovine outbreaks in 2011 with 11 cases, and 35 human related cases. And in 2005, ProMED-mail reported 11 human cases with 1 death in relation to slaughtered cattle. This says that too often the reporting is via Public Health and not the veterinary services. This report is a valuable exception.

Liaoning is on the north east coast, adjoining North Korea, and north east of Beijing; see http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/china_pol01.jpg. - Mod.MHJ
