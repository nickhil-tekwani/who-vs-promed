The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (30 Sep 2018) received notification of an additional human case of avian influenza A(H5N6) in Guangdong from the National Health Commission, and again urged the public to maintain strict personal, food and environmental hygiene both locally and during travel.

The case involved a 22 year old man from Guangzhou in Guangdong. He developed symptoms on 25 Sep 2018 and was hospitalised on the next day. He is now in a serious condition. The patient had contact with live poultry before the onset of symptoms.

From 2014 to date, 21 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported by the mainland health authorities. "All novel influenza A infections, including H5N6, are notifiable infectious diseases in Hong Kong," the spokesman said.

Travellers to the mainland or other affected areas must avoid visiting wet markets, live poultry markets, or farms. They should be alert to the presence of backyard poultry when visiting relatives and friends. They should also avoid purchasing live or freshly slaughtered poultry, and avoid touching poultry/birds or their droppings. They should strictly observe personal and hand hygiene when visiting any place with live poultry.

Travellers returning from affected areas should consult a doctor promptly if symptoms develop, and inform the doctor of their travel history for prompt diagnosis and treatment of potential diseases. It is essential to tell the doctor if they have seen any live poultry during travel, which may imply possible exposure to contaminated environments. This will enable the doctor to assess the possibility of avian influenza and arrange necessary investigations and appropriate treatment in a timely manner.

[H5N6 influenza virus is essentially an avian strain that poses a potential threat to public health since its emergence in China in 2013. Molecular surveillance of live poultry markets in Hunan province (central China, located on the Eastern Asian-Australian migratory bird flyway and where a human fatal case was reported), was conducted by Yingying and colleagues during 2014-15. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that H5N6 avian influenza viruses contain at least 6 genotypes arising from reassortment of gene segments, including a rare variant with an HA gene derived from H5N1 clade 2.3.2 and a novel NP gene with origins in H7N3 viruses (https://jvi.asm.org/content/91/12/e00143-17).

The report above brings the tally of human cases of avian H5N6 influenza to 22. The viruses remain essentially avian but continued surveillance in the avian population is necessary to track their potential for transmission and establishment in humans. - Mod.UBA
