[Following up on a "heads-up" from one of our members we have obtained the
following information from USDA Veterinary Services, Colorado. - Mod.MHJ
We have 7 confirmed positive VS cases in Colorado:
1 by virus isolation (VS Indiana virus)
6 by serology
4 VS Indiana
2 VS (type unconfirmed)
Outbreak was recognized 24 July; first case in Longmont (Weld County)
Cases have been along the front range, in two counties, Weld and Boulder.

[The USDA does a good job with suspect VS cases and their diagnostic
procedure is as follows: All equid samples are tested at USDA/ARS Ames for
VSI and VSNJ or by virus isolation. All bovid samples are sent to Plum
island to be tested for VS viruses as well as a battery of other creatures.
It is interesting that equids with clinically-suspect VS, but shown to not
have VS, are not tested further. There might be a gold mine out there.
There are certainly other yet-to-be-identified vesiculoviruses out there.
(Charlie has identified a few). - Mods.CHC & MHJ
