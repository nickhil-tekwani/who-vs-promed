More than 1000 children are feared to have been affected by Japanese
encephalitis [virus] in Bihar's Gaya district. One child has been
dying every day for the last 3 months in the district. This outbreak
comes even as Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh battles against viral
encephalitis.

A mother's world has come crashing down on her. Her 2-year old
daughter succumbed to Japanese encephalitis [virus infection], but she
hasn't even had time to mourn her, as her son is fighting for his life
at the hospital. Encephalitis, or brain fever as it is called in Gaya,
has already taken the lives of 84 children in the last 80 days at this
hospital alone in Gaya. The collective figure could be much more
alarming.

Each year, Japanese encephalitis takes hundreds of lives in 10
districts in central Bihar and Jharkhand including Jahanabad,
Aurangabad, Chatra, and a part of Patna.

The one thing that unites all families who are forced to live in slums
with poor sanitation, is utter poverty. A majority of victims belong
to the Musahar caste, a rat-eating community who breeds pigs for a
living.

Dr AK Ravi, HoD [head of department], Pediatrics department, Magadh
hospital, Gaya, said, "It's most common in poor people because of
hygiene conditions and keeping pigs as pet animals."

In last 81 days, the killer disease encephalitis has claimed lives of
84 children in Gaya alone, and is still counting, leaving many
families devastated. But the deaths have failed to wake up the state
government's health department from its deep slumber, which has not
only reacted late, but is still struggling to figure out the ways to
contain this killer disease.

In hospitals it's the same old story with little infrastructure and
barely functioning equipment. For the moment, a team of doctors and a
batch of medicines have been rushed in from Patna, but for the 84
children of Gaya and their families, it's already too late.

were brought in with high fever.

According to the medical college, 384 children have been admitted so

[The 1st report above, indicates that Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus
is responsible for these encephalitis cases. The 2nd report does not
indicate possible etiologies. Previous recent reports from Bihar and
neighboring Uttar Pradesh states indicate that less than half of the
encephalitis cases are due to Japanese encephalitis virus infection,
the majority being associated with contaminated water and perhaps are
due to enteroviruses. Neither of the reports above mentions past,
current, or planned JE vaccination campaigns.
