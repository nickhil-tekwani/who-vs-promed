Suspected Outbreak of Monkeypox in Republic of Congo
----------------------------------------------------
In light of recent outbreaks of monkeypox in the United States linked
to importation of rodents from Africa, your readers will probably be
interested in the following report [see below] we received from Dr.
Joseph Harvey, a graduate of our tropical medicine training program
at Tulane. Dr. Harvey has worked for many years as a medical
missionary in Republic of Congo (Brazzaville), and he reports an
outbreak of a disease that looks very much like smallpox in Impfondo,
a provincial capital in the northern part of that country. He has
sent us some impressive photos of patients with pustular and
vesicular lesions, all appearing to be at the same stage, with
umbilication. Some patients had significant lymphadenopathy. Unlike
smallpox, the mortality he describes in this outbreak so far has been
low, so monkeypox is a distinct possibility. This report is currently
unconfirmed, but CDC is involved and is aiding in the investigation.

Dr. Joseph Harvey's Report [edited]
-----------------------------------
Impfondo is a remote, isolated town of approximately 45 000 people in
the center of the Congo Basin Rain Forest. Impfondo is the Capital
of the Likouala Region, which is the northernmost region of the
Republic of Congo. Impfondo is located on the western banks of the
Oubangui River, a major tributary of the Congo River. It is
surrounded by dense tropical rain forest.
Monkeypox is known to occur primarily in the rain forest countries of
Central and West Africa. People here do have frequent contact with
forest animals, including monkeys, which are often used as bush-meat.
Very limited, basic, village, lab facilities do exist in Impfondo,
but most of the "labs" are chronically short on supplies and reagents.
Last week (I believe it was Sat 14 Jun 2003), while driving through
Impfondo, I saw an otherwise health-appearing young man (probably in
his early 20s) with multiple, widely-disseminated, impressive,
healing smallpox-like lesions walking on the sidewalk near Impfondo's
biggest market.
This evening, Thu 19 June 2003, Dr. Wassa-Wassa, Chief of Medicine
and Pediatrics at the government hospital in Impfondo stopped by our
house to request my assistance in educating the population about the
need for strict isolation procedures to prevent the spread of an
outbreak of "variola". As soon as I heard about this, I went to the
hospital to examine the patients. I examined 4 patients.
In the first private room: (1) An approximately 9-month old baby boy
with numerous widely-disseminated, healing, deep-seated, firm,
well-circumscribed
round umbilicated and some coalescing lesions, all at the same stage
of development. The child was listless, febrile, and had coryza. [I
have borrowed some of the descriptive terms from "Evaluating Patients
for Smallpox" information guide Version 1.0: 31 Jan 2002 published by
CDC, because they describe these cases perfectly]. (2) A 6 year-old
girl, (the baby's maternal aunt) with malaise and fever, and the same
lesions in an earlier stage, more vesicle-like. (3) The 16 year-old
mother of the baby (and older sister to patient #2) who had recovered
from a similar illness, showing only rare, healed lesions. The mother
reported that the index case was her 12-year old brother, who had
already been discharged from the hospital.
In a separate private room: (4) A 4 year-old boy (unrelated to the
other patients, but living on the same hospital compound) with fewer
smaller, papular, widely-disseminated, firm, well-circumscribed round
lesions. According to his mother, his illness began with a febrile
prodrome 5 days ago, followed by the lesions 2 days ago. He has
significant lymphadenopathy with a 3 cm node in the right anterior
cervical region, and significant rhinorrhea and some cough. No
hepatosplenomegaly. His father is the head nurse for the medical
ward, and they live on the hospital compound. His 10-year old
sister died last week of a similar illness.
I should note that the nurse on call who showed us to the patients'
rooms did not have access to examination gloves, masks, protective
gowns, goggles or face shields, running water, soap, bleach, or
alcohol. The first room had no lights. The patients were being fed
and attended to by several unprotected family members. Apparently the
index case (the younger brother of patient #3) was a 12-year old boy
who had traveled to a village 12 kms outside of Impfondo for Easter
vacation. He got sick on 15 Apr 2003, and was hospitalized after
returning to Impfondo. He has since been discharged from the
hospital. He lives on the hospital compound in the same house with
patients 1, 2 and 3. His father is the physician's assistant in
charge of medicine and pediatrics. I was told by family members and
hospital staff that there have been 10 cases, with one 10 year old
child who died last week. All of the cases treated at the hospital
seem to be family members or close contacts of hospital staff that
live on the hospital compound.
After examining the patients, I interviewed some of the staff
members. Dr.Wassa-Wassa was very knowledgeable and extremely helpful.
He had taken photos of several patients, and sent them to his
superiors in Brazzaville, trying to sound the alarm. Apparently the
reply was that this must be varicella [chickenpox], because variola
[smallox] had been eradicated years ago. I believe we are most likely
dealing with a monkeypox outbreak (it is definitely not chickenpox),
but we can't be sure without viral laboratory studies which are
unavailable in this region. I feel strongly that positive
identification of the causative agent should be pursued in a timely
fashion. I would like to rule out smallpox, since people in this area
haven't been vaccinated in years, and given the high threat of
international bioterrorism. If smallpox were to reoccur someday, or
if it has remained undetected since 1977, it would probably show up
in someplace like the Likouala Region, one of the most isolated spots
on earth.
It is clear that person-to-person spread of this infection is continuing to
occur. Also, immediate measures need to be taken to prevent the spread of
this disease. These would include the institution of general infection
control precautions; e.g. according to the CDC Health Advisory (contained in
Health Alert Priority #44, dated 9 Jun 2003, from NY County of Erie
Department of Health, Anthony J. Billittier IV, MD, FACEP,
Commissioner of Health). I am planning to obtain serum and vesicular
fluid samples from the active cases, and send them on the plane to
Brazzaville tomorrow morning [Fri 20 Jun 2003].

[ProMED-mail greatly appreciates the receipt of this first-hand
report. The excellent clinical descriptions by Dr. Harvey are
certainly suggestive of monkeypox. Further information is awaited
with interest, in particular confirmation of the tentative diagnosis
by laboratory testing. Dr. Richard Oberhelman has indicated that
updated information may be obtainable direct from Dr. Harvey. -
