A boy at Bankatti in Bhimdatta Municipality-14 [Kanchanpur district, Far-Western region, Nepal] has died of Japanese encephalitis in the district.

The deceased has been identified as a 6-year-old boy of Saraswoti Tole. He breathed his last while being treated at Baraily in India [Uttar Pradesh state] 2 weeks ago. Meanwhile, another local resident, 55 [years old], is said to be suffering from the same disease and is undergoing treatment at in Baraily.

Dr Suvesh Raj Kayastha of Seti Zonal Hospital said the disease was confirmed based on symptoms. Though immunisation against the disease was carried out in the area, health authorities said even those who were vaccinated against the ailment may suffer from the disease in some cases.

According to health workers, the disease is transmitted from infected animals including pigs, wild boars and ducks to humans by mosquitoes belonging to _Culex_ species. And, while one can be vaccinated for the disease, there is no specific medication for the treatment. Hence, the treatment is focused on relieving severe clinical signs and supporting patients to overcome the infection.

[The lowland tropical areas of Nepal are endemic for Japanese encephalitis. However, diagnosis of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection based on clinical grounds alone without laboratory tests to support it is uncertain, given that a number of viruses can cause encephalitis. The vaccination status of the 2 cases is not given, although JEV immunizations were carried out in the area. If the inactivated virus vaccine was used, the duration of immunity would not have been long lasting.

Pigs are mentioned in the above report because they can serve as amplifying hosts for JEV. Birds, especially ardeids (herons), are reservoir hosts, and the mosquito vectors are several _Culex_ species.

Bhimdatta is the 9th largest city in Nepal. It is 5 kilometres (about 3.1 miles) east of the Indian border and 700 kilometres (about 430 miles) west of Kathmandu. It is in the tropical zone of Nepal, where the habitat favors transmission of JEV.

Encephalitis claimed 4 more lives here [Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh state, India] since Tuesday [8 Sep 2015], increasing the death toll to 161 this year. Local MP Yogi Adityanath visited the BRD Medical College where most of the encephalitis patients are admitted, and met the grieved family.

On Wednesday [9 Sep 2015], 4 individuals died of encephalitis, while 14 encephalitis patients were admitted to the medical college since Tuesday. A total of 828 encephalitis cases have been reported till date in the medical college among which 125 are still undergoing treatment.

Yogi Adityanath [member of parliament] visited the medical college and consoled the aggrieved families. He also inspected the encephalitis and academic wards and asked the attendants about the facilities available. He also inquired about the ventilators in the hospital.

While talking to reporters, he said that he would discuss the problems of the hospital, including shortage of staff, with the state's health minister.

On the death of children, chief campaigner of Encephalitis Eradication Movement, Dr R N Singh said, "Hundreds of children are dying year after year due to encephalitis. This disease is 100 percent preventable but the government always puts stress on development of ways of cure rather than its prevention. We could eradicate encephalitis totally from the country if we invest resources on timely execution of prevention activities."

[There have been numerous JE cases in northeastern India again in 2015. Since this area is in the JE virus endemic area, with human cases occurring every year, these additional cases are not surprising.

Eradication of the disease would only be possible if the etiologies of the encephalitis cases were known. Some, but not all cases are due to JEV infections and could be prevented by vaccination. Other etiologies could be involved and include enterovirus infection from contaminated water, Reye syndrome, lychee consumption and heatstroke (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20150909.3633134). - Mod.TY
